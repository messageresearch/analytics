[0:00] We'll be going through these verses, I
[0:02] believe, just verse by verse once we get
[0:04] started. I thought it would be good
[0:05] maybe to tee it up here at the outset.
[0:08] Matthew chapter 15 verses 10 to 20. And
[0:12] he called the multitude and said unto
[0:14] them, "Hear and understand,
[0:17] not that which goeth into the mouth
[0:19] defileth a man, but that which cometh
[0:21] out of the mouth, this defileth a man."
[0:24] That's a such a comp complex statement.
[0:29] Then came his disciples and said unto
[0:30] him, "Knowest thou that the Pharisees
[0:33] were offended after they heard this
[0:34] saying?" But he answered and said,
[0:36] "Every plant which my heavenly Father
[0:38] hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let
[0:41] them alone, they be blind leaders of the
[0:44] blind. And if the blind lead the blind,
[0:46] both shall fall into the ditch." Then
[0:49] answered Peter and said unto him,
[0:51] Declare unto us this parable. And Jesus
[0:53] said, "Are you also without yet without
[0:56] understanding? Do not ye yet understand
[0:59] that whatsoever enterth in at the mouth
[1:01] goeth into the belly, and it cast out,
[1:04] and is cast out into the drought. But
[1:06] those things which proceed out of the
[1:08] mouth come from the heart, and they
[1:10] defile the man. For out of the heart
[1:12] proceedth evil thoughts, murders,
[1:14] adulteries, fornications, theft, false
[1:16] witness, blasphemies. These are the
[1:18] things which defile a man. But to eat
[1:20] with unwashing hands defileth not a man.
[1:24] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:28] There's a lot of weight in these
[1:29] scriptures, a lot of things to uh
[1:32] wrestle with and kind of grab a hold of.
[1:34] And I want to do it in with this title,
[1:37] spiritual
[1:39] amuseia.
[1:41] And when I've said this to a few people
[1:43] this morning, they all thought I was
[1:45] stuttering or had a list, but it's
[1:47] spiritual amusia. Uh I know what I'm
[1:50] talking about. Just stay with me. That's
[1:53] my title. But let's just jump right
[1:54] here. Matthew 15 10 I'll read verse 11
[1:58] but we are going to work through
[2:00] hopefully to verse 20 says and he called
[2:02] the multitude and said unto them hear
[2:04] and understand we've been looking at
[2:06] this concept of hearing been looking at
[2:09] the theme of music and the subject I'm
[2:11] looking at this morning uh began at the
[2:14] very outset in looking at how God's
[2:16] Bible is song God's symphony it's music
[2:20] uh and it has a musical connotation or
[2:22] music can be used as a type of this
[2:24] great truth of God's word. And so it was
[2:27] in this hearing and understanding. Uh I
[2:30] was originally looking at how there's
[2:32] consonants in songs, things that are
[2:33] good, but then there's the dissonant
[2:35] chords that add to it and maybe they're
[2:37] the foroding, the melancholy, the sad
[2:39] parts, but yet they play together with
[2:41] the overall composition to create a
[2:44] masterpiece, something beautiful. And
[2:46] and so this is still kind of in that
[2:48] theme today. And it says, "Hear and
[2:50] understand." So, it's not just hearing,
[2:52] but there's something that you catch.
[2:55] Not that which goeth into the mouth
[2:57] defileth a man, but that which cometh
[3:00] out of the mouth. This defileth a man.
[3:03] What Jesus is referring to, and
[3:05] especially as we see in the later
[3:06] verses, you could see this is what he's
[3:07] hitting at. It means to make unclean or
[3:10] to render unholy or unhallowed or to
[3:12] make profane, common, just common. And
[3:15] it's Levitical, Levitically unclean
[3:18] under the law. under the Levitical law
[3:21] as you could read in many different
[3:22] places in Leviticus, some in numbers and
[3:24] other places, how that there was
[3:26] something that would be defiled. So
[3:28] there was a difference in meats and
[3:30] different forms of washing were to be
[3:32] observed. And this was legislated
[3:34] because it would say if you do this, you
[3:36] are unclean or defiled or a man that
[3:38] does this. And some of it stronger than
[3:40] others to where you realize, man, any
[3:42] man that would uh uh commit that type of
[3:44] perversion, that's polluted, that's
[3:46] unclean. But then others seem to be very
[3:48] common things such as the meats that you
[3:50] would eat and the different forms of
[3:52] washing. In the Old Testament, if
[3:55] something was defiled, it was to be
[3:56] profained, polluted, to be unclean or
[3:59] impure.
[4:00] And if we took it on its face when he
[4:02] says that which goes into the mouth
[4:04] doesn't defile a man. And this is in
[4:07] response to they accused him of, you
[4:09] know, eating with uh sinners and his
[4:12] disciples ate with unwashed hands. And
[4:15] so this was just such an offense to them
[4:17] given the clarity in the Old Testament
[4:19] on these things. And so not that I'm
[4:22] playing devil's advocate, but Christ
[4:24] appears to controvert the law that
[4:26] they're saying they they observe these
[4:28] things, very particular about it, wanted
[4:29] things to be observed a particular way.
[4:32] And so now Christ says something that
[4:33] seems to be in contradiction with what
[4:36] Moses delivered. But he starts all of it
[4:39] with saying, "Hear and understand."
[4:41] almost acknowledging at the outset that
[4:43] I'm about to say something that on its
[4:45] face you might just be willing want to
[4:46] reject outright as being contradictory
[4:49] but listen to me hear me out understand
[4:52] what I'm trying to say. So he prompts
[4:54] the hearer to go beyond the phrasing in
[4:58] order to catch the truth.
[5:00] So immediately after he has said this,
[5:02] no surprise, then the disciples, verse
[5:04] 12, then came his disciples and said to
[5:06] him, "Knowest thou that the Pharisees
[5:08] were offended after they after they
[5:10] heard this saying? No kidding." Right?
[5:13] This went to the very heart of those who
[5:15] are maybe if there's some pretense when
[5:17] you knock away their false props, right?
[5:19] I can hide behind the fact that I wash
[5:20] my hands before I eat. I can hide behind
[5:22] the fact that I don't mix my cotton with
[5:24] my linens. As soon as you start knocking
[5:26] out these props, immediately they're
[5:28] stumbled. They're tripped up. They're
[5:30] irritated. Triggered.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; But why were they triggered?
[5:35] Not because of what they heard, but what
[5:37] they didn't understand.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; They weren't triggered so much by what
[5:41] they heard. Because he said, "Here," and
[5:43] they heard. And when they heard, they
[5:44] were they were upset and irritated. But
[5:46] what did they fail to do? They failed to
[5:48] understand.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; Very plainly, we could say the Messiah
[5:52] spoke truth. And just to use a phrase
[5:54] that we've been using, their hearts
[5:56] weren't tuned to understand what he was
[5:59] saying.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Hear and understand. Not just, he wasn't
[6:02] just playing a melody and you could just
[6:04] choose to like it or not like it because
[6:06] they chose not to like it. But can you
[6:08] appreciate it?
[6:09] &gt;&gt; Can you understand it?
[6:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; In Mark chapter 7 in this in this
[6:14] reciting of the same thing, he said, "If
[6:16] if men have ears to hear, let them
[6:18] hear." So again, it's that ability to
[6:20] understand. Yeah.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; And really when you think about the
[6:23] Pharisees, as we've identified them
[6:25] quite often in scripture, they're
[6:26] identified as one thing most frequently
[6:28] as hypocrites. And no one is more
[6:31] susceptible to take offense than a
[6:32] hypocrite when questioned.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[6:35] &gt;&gt; No one is more susceptible than to
[6:38] really respond uh angrily as the one
[6:41] who's guilty.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Did you lie? How dare you accuse me of
[6:47] lying?
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Right? It's kind of like the answer I
[6:50] think should have just been no.
[6:53] Why did I say something that misled you?
[6:56] And so the Pharisees are feel somewhat
[6:59] called out by this. Verse 13. But he
[7:01] answered and said, this is his response
[7:03] to Jesus. Did you know that you offended
[7:05] the Pharisees? Every plant which my
[7:07] heavenly father hath not planted shall
[7:09] be rooted up. So there's this reference
[7:12] to this predestinated planting. And that
[7:15] predestinated planting is going to be uh
[7:18] natured or elected, if I could say it
[7:20] that way, receptive to the water and
[7:23] light
[7:24] under the right kind of conditions that
[7:26] he gives his nurturing and his nature.
[7:28] They're they're going to be fruitful. So
[7:30] not every planting, and this is
[7:32] important because he said Israel was
[7:34] that vine that God planted.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; And so though Israel was planted as a
[7:38] noble vine, now they are a degenerate,
[7:41] strange vine as the scripture teaches
[7:43] us. And what their religion had become
[7:45] was not what God planted, not what God
[7:48] desired. Even though we could say he did
[7:50] envision this, he prophesied it. And I
[7:53] think it bears noting that we should be
[7:55] sensitive to offending, but we cannot
[7:57] fear
[8:00] uh we cannot for fear of offending
[8:01] neglect truth.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; I think we should be sensitive to
[8:05] offense and we should be woe unto them
[8:07] that brings offense. So we should be
[8:09] sensitive to offending but we cannot
[8:11] fear of offending and in doing so
[8:14] neglect truth. Truth must must be owned.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Our our duty must be uh done. And then
[8:20] we could say if truth is owned and our
[8:22] duty done then if there is offense it's
[8:24] on their part. It's their fault.
[8:27] In the sermon why I'm against organized
[8:29] religion. I think that's one of the
[8:30] things that we miss the most about the
[8:32] message of the hour. It was a rebuke to
[8:34] organized religion. And sometimes what
[8:37] when we make the mistake of organizing
[8:39] around being against organized religion,
[8:41] we become another organized religion
[8:44] &gt;&gt; and we've missed the truth of Christ and
[8:46] all of it. So for a lot of people, their
[8:48] paradigm of the message has been
[8:49] organized religion is wrong. So let's
[8:51] organize a religion that's against
[8:53] organized religion. And then that's the
[8:55] only platform you have
[8:57] &gt;&gt; is you're against the status quo. You're
[8:59] against organization. You're against
[9:00] denomination. And really, you're just
[9:02] another organized religion. He says,
[9:04] "Lord, I'm sure of this." And he's
[9:06] praying, "My heart would break if this
[9:07] scripture wasn't read real to me." When
[9:09] you said, "All that the father has given
[9:11] me will come. My sheep hear my voice."
[9:14] I'm using this statement, too, just to
[9:15] show where the heart of a servant would
[9:17] be. And even Christ knew my sheep hear
[9:20] my voice that when I speak to the
[9:22] Pharisees and some of them are offended,
[9:24] I I'm not don't I can't be blamed if I
[9:26] spoke what I was supposed to speak and
[9:28] I'm not even going to be very
[9:30] necessarily critical of them. It's not
[9:32] up to me.
[9:34] The Lord, I guess the kingdom is truly
[9:36] as you said. I know it. It's like a unto
[9:39] a man that took a net and went to the
[9:40] lake and cast in the net and pulled
[9:42] every kind. There was no doubt scavenger
[9:44] fish. There were turtles, waters,
[9:46] spiders, serpents, everything that the
[9:47] gospel net caught. But finally, by and
[9:49] by, the crawfish backed into the water
[9:52] again. The turtle pulled away. The
[9:53] serpent hissed and took back to the mud
[9:55] hole like a dog to its vomit or a hog to
[9:57] its swallow. But there was real fish
[9:59] there, Lord. And I have this consolation
[10:02] of knowing that even before the net went
[10:03] over them, they were fish then.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Preaching the gospel is not a magic
[10:08] trick.
[10:10] It's not that you could come to church
[10:11] long enough and do your part to where
[10:13] all of a sudden you're going to be
[10:14] changed into an elected seed of God. No,
[10:18] the election's there or it's not.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; And not only should that be a comfort to
[10:22] you, uh it should help you with
[10:24] understanding how God works.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; They were born predestinated fish. And
[10:29] so this gospel net catches out into the
[10:32] revivals. You know your own. The only
[10:35] thing I'm responsible, Father, as far as
[10:36] I know, is stay true to this word.
[10:38] That's what we must do. Duty must be
[10:40] owned. Truth must be owned. He says,
[10:44] "You are the one who decides which is
[10:46] which." And I know that no more than the
[10:49] turtle could come become a trout. So
[10:51] could a man or person that has deaf ears
[10:53] to the gospel ever understand the truth.
[10:56] For the father has foresaw this and you
[10:59] have promised that all that he give you
[11:01] would come. I know I'm reading it from
[11:03] the message of the hour but these are
[11:04] very clear scriptural principles that
[11:06] you that it's up to God.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; You know can the can the clay say to God
[11:11] in Romans it says can the clay say unto
[11:13] the potter why have you made me thus as
[11:16] if to say I I I should be my own and I
[11:18] should make my own decisions. There's
[11:20] something to the uh sovereignty of God.
[11:23] So he says,"Not every plant which is
[11:26] planted has my heavenly father planted."
[11:30] Because he's saying, "Every plant that
[11:31] he has not planted will be uprooted or
[11:33] perish." So he says in verse 14, "Let
[11:36] them alone. Do not be troubled or
[11:38] concerned with their being offended. Let
[11:41] them alone. They be blind leaders of the
[11:44] blind." Maybe so much for being
[11:46] politically correct.
[11:49] Uh uh and and being soft and sensitive
[11:52] in the moment. He says, "They be blind
[11:54] leaders of the blind. And if the blind
[11:56] lead the blind, both shall fall into the
[11:59] ditch." Isn't that right, brother?
[12:01] Right. The blind lead the blind, they're
[12:03] all going to fall
[12:04] &gt;&gt; into the ditch. So, he's saying, "Do not
[12:06] be afraid of those upon whom my word has
[12:10] not been positively received."
[12:13] I know for as human beings, we we often
[12:15] want to we look for consensus and that's
[12:17] why we kind of check, you know, what's
[12:19] the number one fast food restaurant and
[12:20] we all find out it's Del Taco or
[12:22] something like so that's where I go to
[12:23] get my Mexican food now. What's number
[12:25] two? Okay, Chick-fil-A. That's where
[12:27] we're going to go to get our chicken
[12:28] sandwich. We want to we want to fit in
[12:31] and and numbers mean a lot to us and the
[12:33] crowd uh it does something that you know
[12:35] if a lot of people are doing sometimes
[12:37] that's what we need uh to pat ourselves
[12:39] on the back and feel like we belong. So
[12:41] anytime that there's people who are
[12:43] offended, the disciples are they have
[12:45] that human instinct like, "Oh no, this
[12:47] is an important group of people. These
[12:49] are powerful people." But he's saying,
[12:51] "Don't fear if my word isn't positively
[12:54] received.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Don't don't desire their favor.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Don't fear their displeasure.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Don't court their acceptance.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Do not labor to please those that do not
[13:07] please God."
[13:09] I
[13:09] &gt;&gt; think this is one of the biggest traps
[13:11] we can fall into as Christians is when
[13:13] we strive to please those that do not
[13:16] please God.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; You I don't think that we should be
[13:19] overly aggressive and offensive and we
[13:20] just go out and call sin out for what it
[13:22] is and we we're just brutish and we're
[13:24] now protesting in front of abortion
[13:25] clinics and we're doing this because I
[13:27] don't want to strive to please people
[13:29] who don't please God. No, he says he's
[13:32] saying let them alone.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. A and so it doesn't mean we have
[13:36] to change our sensibilities to cater to
[13:38] them say oh well I understand this and
[13:39] understand that
[13:41] &gt;&gt; we're not obligated here even he says to
[13:43] respond or have anything to do with them
[13:45] let them alone don't mind their anger
[13:48] really think about what he's saying I
[13:49] know let them alone seems like such a
[13:51] brief phrase but he's saying don't don't
[13:52] mind their resentment
[13:55] &gt;&gt; uh their reproaches and even their uh uh
[13:57] the reflections they have for he says
[13:59] they are blind
[14:02] &gt;&gt; and not physically blind or legally
[14:05] blind.
[14:07] As I as I get older, I'm realizing that
[14:09] there's there's a legal blindness. Uh
[14:12] that you don't have to be completely
[14:14] without sight to feel like you're losing
[14:15] your eyesight, but spiritually blind yet
[14:19] trying to spiritually lead. They be the
[14:22] blind leading the blind.
[14:24] Now what is by using the phrase blind
[14:28] he's using a sense that we all have or
[14:31] that we have it normally or that we
[14:33] ought to have one of those five senses
[14:34] to where there's sensory input and then
[14:36] there's this subsequent interpretation
[14:38] and what he's saying is in there
[14:40] something's deformed
[14:42] in there somewhere that there's either
[14:44] something if we use blindness there's
[14:46] either something wrong optically with
[14:48] the nerve or the cornea some light's not
[14:52] being filtered correctly it's not
[14:53] happening physically or there's
[14:55] something wrong mentally
[14:57] &gt;&gt; where the brain isn't able to translate
[14:59] the data into a clear image.
[15:02] They be blind leaders of the blind. He
[15:05] said if the blind lead the blind both
[15:07] shall fall into the ditch. So what would
[15:09] that evoke more? Sympathy, right?
[15:12] Instead of the
[15:14] it's sympathy because you realize
[15:16] they're blind. In
[15:18] &gt;&gt; verse 15, then answered Peter and said
[15:20] unto him, declare unto us this parable.
[15:22] When when you read it, you might think,
[15:24] well, he's wanting to know more about
[15:26] the blind leading the blind. And Jesus
[15:28] said, are ye also yet without
[15:30] understanding? So understanding is at
[15:31] the heart of it.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; When the Pharisees heard and were
[15:35] offended, it's because they lacked an
[15:37] understanding of what he said. Maybe
[15:39] they wanted to pigeon hole it as well.
[15:41] This is in direct contradiction to to
[15:43] what the mo Moses's law said instead of
[15:45] really taking a step back and thinking
[15:47] you know what he has a point there
[15:50] that really what he's saying really
[15:52] makes a lot of sense he says and Jesus
[15:54] said are you without understanding so
[15:56] this contradictions may be evident on
[15:58] its face so understanding was critical
[16:01] to know the truth of it
[16:03] &gt;&gt; so such that you don't try to paint the
[16:05] Messiah as being in contradiction to the
[16:09] very prophet Moses Moes who said he was
[16:11] coming wouldn't be a very good platform,
[16:14] right, to build is to say that I am he
[16:17] that Moses spoke of and Moses, by the
[16:19] way, gave the most ridiculous
[16:20] commandments
[16:22] and and was leading you astray. That
[16:25] wouldn't make a lot of sense.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 11:es 2-6, "And now when John
[16:30] had heard in prison the works of Christ,
[16:33] he sent two of his disciples and said
[16:34] unto him, Art thou he that should come,
[16:37] or do we look for another?"
[16:39] Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go
[16:41] and show John again those things which
[16:44] you do hear and see." Now, if you if you
[16:47] were to track this back, it's not just a
[16:51] matter of signs and wonders being
[16:53] performed, but what we look for is
[16:55] scripture being fulfilled.
[16:58] When Jesus says, "Go and show John again
[17:00] those things which you do see it here."
[17:02] He begins to quote very specifically a
[17:04] prophecy in Isaiah that said these
[17:06] things would happen and that would be
[17:08] the sign.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; So it it's it's not uh you know that we
[17:13] just take this and say all right this is
[17:14] the way that we can always do this and
[17:16] such and such. But uh uh in other words
[17:18] like now the blind have to be receiving
[17:19] their sight in those things. Don't try
[17:21] to make it more than what it is here.
[17:23] This is a very sign of God. This is what
[17:25] God does. So, I'm not trying to take
[17:26] that away, but more or less I want you
[17:28] to see that Jesus is pointing to
[17:30] scriptural prophecy here. The blind
[17:32] receive their sight and the lame walk.
[17:34] The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear,
[17:36] the dead are raised up, and the poor
[17:38] have the gospel preached to them. This
[17:41] is what the Messiah was to do. This is
[17:43] the very signs of Christ. This is the
[17:45] power of God. He says, "Blessed is he
[17:47] whosoever shall not be offended in me."
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Why does he say that? because John was
[17:54] offended.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's another way that he
[17:57] thought this was supposed to be
[17:58] transpiring. Didn't like the way that it
[18:00] was happening. So he says, John saying,
[18:02] "Well, go ask if he's even the Messiah.
[18:04] Go ask if this is even what we thought
[18:05] it was." And he says, "Go show him what
[18:09] is being done." And I believe that it's
[18:11] scriptural because that's the scripture
[18:13] is what would have anchored John as a
[18:15] prophet back to the truth that yes, this
[18:18] is what the Messiah was to do. or it
[18:20] would hearken the prophet back to the
[18:21] word to realize, you know what? This is
[18:24] what God promised in Isaiah. This is the
[18:26] fulfillment of those things. Blessed is
[18:28] he who is not offended in me. So
[18:31] offenses are easy to come by,
[18:34] &gt;&gt; especially with the way that Christ
[18:36] chose to preach the gospel,
[18:39] chose to go about it. He went about it
[18:40] in such a way to where the the the ones
[18:43] who were steeped in Messiah prophecy,
[18:46] the ones who were steeped in the
[18:48] religion, it was their identity, it was
[18:50] their culture, it was their ethnicity,
[18:51] everything, the very ones that were the
[18:53] most would have been the most receptive
[18:54] to the Messiah were the most rehended by
[18:58] the Messiah.
[19:01] And just seems to me it would have been
[19:02] nice if we could have all just got along
[19:04] and and the Jews accepted him and then
[19:06] all the Muslims accepted him and then
[19:08] all of us accepted him and we were all
[19:10] just one big happy family because Jesus
[19:13] just did everything so perfectly and so
[19:15] plain that everybody's like, "Yeah, that
[19:17] has to be has to be the son of God." I
[19:20] mean, he's 2,000 years old, man. Look at
[19:23] this guy. Perfectly. Have you seen his
[19:25] skin? How come he doesn't get do a get
[19:28] ready with me video?
[19:30] I want to know what his routine is.
[19:34] He says, "Blessed is he who is not
[19:36] offended in me." Verse 17, then Matthew
[19:39] chapter 15, "Do ye yet un do not ye yet
[19:44] understand?" So this is uh him kind of
[19:47] following up on that. Are you without
[19:49] understanding?
[19:56] that whatsoever enterth in at the mouth
[19:58] goeth into the belly, and is cast out
[20:00] into the drought. Does anybody need an
[20:02] interpretation of this?
[20:05] Anybody?
[20:06] I I I didn't I'm not using a
[20:08] demonstrative slide.
[20:12] Now, do you know what he's saying? The
[20:13] things you eat go through a process.
[20:18] Food enters in the belly is processed.
[20:20] The nutrients are absorbed and the waste
[20:22] is discarded.
[20:23] Jesus said this is what happens when you
[20:25] eat something. But those things which
[20:27] proceed out of the mouth come forth from
[20:30] the heart and they defile the man.
[20:34] Yeah.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Now, so it's not what you eat
[20:38] that defiles and makes someone impure,
[20:41] unholy, uh unacceptable, unclean, but
[20:45] it's those things that are proceeding
[20:47] from the heart that defile the man. For
[20:49] out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
[20:51] murders, adulteries, fornications,
[20:53] thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
[20:56] These are the things which defile a man.
[20:58] But to eat with unwashing hands defileth
[21:01] not a man. Now, in his explanation of
[21:03] it, I think it's still difficult for the
[21:06] Pharisees to get over the fact that
[21:08] eating with clean hands
[21:11] uh uh is not what or unclean hand is
[21:13] what makes a man ceremony impure. But
[21:17] certainly they could look at this and
[21:18] say, you know what, that's true.
[21:21] It's the heart being corrupted that
[21:24] makes a man corrupt.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; It's the products of a heart that defile
[21:27] a man. Therefore, what I believe Jesus
[21:31] is emphasizing is that which enters the
[21:34] heart be a and pollutes the heart
[21:38] &gt;&gt; is the source of pollution.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; And I think the perfect example here is
[21:43] the Pharisees in this instance when they
[21:45] heard the word it didn't resonate in
[21:48] their heart. So the very thing that went
[21:50] into their heart by through their ear
[21:52] and went into their heart as it began to
[21:54] bounce around within their hearts what
[21:55] came out was offense. Right?
[21:58] &gt;&gt; They weren't even able to process it
[22:00] even to say, "Well, we'll just let that
[22:02] go. Don't understand it. We'll just let
[22:04] it go." They could not process what they
[22:07] heard in a bit in a meaningful way to
[22:10] gain the benefit of Christ's words, the
[22:14] nutrients, the strength.
[22:18] And this is where I want to introduce
[22:22] spiritual amuseia.
[22:26] They were unable to process God's voice,
[22:30] recognize the truth, or even recall the
[22:33] promises.
[22:35] Maybe so fixated on one thing or a
[22:37] certain paradigm that whenever something
[22:39] else is sounding that they they can't
[22:41] recognize it or process it. Has anyone
[22:44] here ever heard of amuseia?
[22:47] Not someone who's pronounced amnesia
[22:48] wrong, but amuseia. Anybody? But this
[22:51] God I you don't realize how much I
[22:53] appreciate you. I would have thought
[22:55] maybe some other doctors here could have
[22:57] had the same, you know, understanding.
[22:59] Nobody else. Amuseia. Come on. Anyone?
[23:02] This is awesome. Breaking new breaking
[23:03] new ground. That is my man right there.
[23:06] See, I'm getting some support here. You
[23:08] guys are going to have to help me out.
[23:09] Amuseia is a musical disorder presenting
[23:12] as a defect in processing pitch, musical
[23:15] recognition, and musical memory. It's a
[23:18] severe def desit deficit in saying
[23:21] desit.
[23:25] It's a defect in properly handling
[23:27] music. Just get deficit out of your
[23:28] vocabulary and you won't stumble over
[23:30] it. French horn. It's a severe deficit
[23:34] in properly handling music. Now, it
[23:37] presents in a lot of different ways. I
[23:38] know a lot of you right now are saying,
[23:39] "Ah, I knew it. That's what I have.
[23:42] That's what brother Aaron has." Or you
[23:43] might be thinking, "You're you're
[23:44] diagnosing right now." Very very few
[23:46] people have this. Very few people have
[23:49] this. When people have this, they can't
[23:51] tell when someone is talking going up.
[23:53] It doesn't sound like that or someone is
[23:55] going down. They wouldn't even recognize
[23:57] when pitch is going up or down.
[24:00] They find would find music unpleasant.
[24:03] Even refer to it as noise. And sometimes
[24:05] people with amusia will find music
[24:06] annoying.
[24:08] Someone with amuseia doesn't display
[24:11] sensitivity to dissonant chords in that
[24:13] melodic uh uh uh context. So they have a
[24:16] hard time handling dissonance. They
[24:19] can't appreciate consonants.
[24:21] And here the Pharisees, they could not
[24:24] hear.
[24:26] Or I could say, let me say it this way.
[24:28] They could hear just fine, but it made
[24:30] them uncomfortable.
[24:34] Jesus said, "Why is it you don't know my
[24:36] understand my speech?" And I was, they
[24:39] were just there's this tonedeafness
[24:42] to where when he's talking, it just was
[24:46] nothing changed. I saw a video that the
[24:49] Savannah School of Arts and Design did
[24:52] on it. Savannah College of Art and
[24:55] Design, SCADA, I think is what they call
[24:56] it. and and they did a video on it or
[25:00] someone who went to the college did one
[25:02] on and his buddy was going to show him a
[25:04] new speaker and he goes here I want to
[25:05] hear this new speaker it sounds awesome
[25:09] and and he starts playing it goes tone
[25:11] tone tone tone tone and then a lyric and
[25:14] he's like oh yeah you know and it's
[25:16] that's how music will sound nothing to
[25:18] it
[25:20] they couldn't handle
[25:23] didn't when they don't know his voice
[25:24] there's no speech that resonates with
[25:26] him.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; The Pharisees, they couldn't handle the
[25:28] dissonance even created by his words.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not what it's not washing hands
[25:33] that's going to make you unclean. It's
[25:34] what's in your heart. No, they couldn't
[25:36] get over the they couldn't even see that
[25:37] the two were different in a way and that
[25:39] one is making a really good point and
[25:40] the other one kind of flies in the face
[25:42] of their traditional logic or knowledge.
[25:43] But yet, maybe if the Messiah these
[25:45] things being taught, maybe there's
[25:47] something to lean into, wrestle with and
[25:49] figure out.
[25:52] In Mark 8 14 to 21
[25:57] says, "Now the disciples had forgotten
[25:59] to take bread, neither had they in the
[26:01] ship with them more than one loaf. And
[26:03] he charged them, saying, Take heed.
[26:05] Beware of the leavenven of the Pharisees
[26:07] and the leavenven of Herod." And they
[26:09] reasoned among themselves, saying, "Is
[26:10] it because we have no bread?" To me,
[26:12] this is one of those comedic moments in
[26:14] the scripture that Jesus makes a
[26:16] reference about the leaven and the
[26:17] Pharisees and the leavenven of Herod.
[26:19] And just humanly they start thinking
[26:20] about the fact that they got into the
[26:22] ship with only one loaf.
[26:25] And he makes this very very poignant
[26:27] statement like, "Wow, that's that's
[26:28] beware of the leaven of the Pharisees."
[26:29] And maybe they're going, "Did the
[26:31] Pharisees bake this?
[26:34] Is this a Trojan loaf? Did Herod slip
[26:38] this into our bag?" And they're thinking
[26:40] about natural bread. And he goes, "Jesus
[26:43] says in verse 15, why reason you because
[26:45] you have no bread?"
[26:47] What?
[26:49] How is it that when I made a statement
[26:51] like that, you immediately just wanted
[26:52] to go to natural things, which is quite
[26:54] interesting considering the fact that
[26:56] those that followed Jesus for the
[26:57] miracles were really digging the bread
[26:59] and then when Jesus went into showing
[27:01] staying to the word and saying things
[27:03] that would make made them stumble, they
[27:04] really just wanted bread. And since they
[27:06] weren't getting the bread they wanted,
[27:07] they said one by one, they just walked
[27:09] away.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; And so this is even maybe an instinct in
[27:12] the heart of the disciples. And so as I
[27:15] say here, there was a a a sensory defect
[27:18] or a harden of heart. This is where I
[27:19] get this from. He says, "Why reason ye
[27:22] because you have no bread?
[27:24] Perceive you not, neither understand?
[27:27] Have your ye your heart yet been
[27:29] hardened? Having eyes see you not?
[27:32] Having ears, hear you not? And do you
[27:34] not remember?" Now, there's all sorts of
[27:35] things he just referred to. perception,
[27:38] understanding,
[27:40] ears to hear, eyes to see, remembrance
[27:43] or memory, a hardened heart. These are
[27:46] all conditions of the heart. When I
[27:48] break the five loaves among 5,000, how
[27:50] many baskets full of fragments took you
[27:52] up? They said unto him, 12. And when the
[27:56] seven among 4,000, how many baskets full
[27:57] of fragments took you up? And they said,
[28:00] seven.
[28:02] And he still has to ask the question,
[28:03] verse 21. And he said unto them, "How is
[28:05] it that you do not understand? Why would
[28:08] I be complaining about natural bread
[28:11] at this moment if I've been able to
[28:13] provide to this extent so far?" So, it's
[28:16] about understanding. Again, it's not
[28:18] just seeing miracles, seeing events and
[28:20] happenings. It's not just being able to
[28:22] record them and and dig into the
[28:25] logistics of it in terms of this is how
[28:26] many of this, this is, how many of that,
[28:27] but he said, "Hear and understand. Can
[28:30] you recognize not just my voice but that
[28:34] what is behind that voice maybe beyond
[28:37] what we might say are signs and
[28:39] understanding the voice of the sign
[28:41] where is in the understanding. So he
[28:43] talked about seeing and hearing and
[28:44] understanding and even remembering and
[28:46] now he says is there even a maybe a
[28:48] hardening of the heart.
[28:51] Do you have the heart in the ability to
[28:56] receive what I'm saying? Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 12:2, "Son of man, thou dwellest
[29:00] in the midst of a rebellious house which
[29:03] have eyes to see and see not. They have
[29:05] ears to hear and hear not." We're not
[29:06] just talking about physical ability
[29:08] where there's eyes in the socket but
[29:10] something severed where they can't
[29:11] process it in their brains. Talking
[29:12] about a spiritual eye and a spiritual
[29:14] heart. Ears to hear and hear not. For
[29:16] they are a rebellious house.
[29:19] No understanding. Jeremiah 5:21. Hear
[29:22] now this, oh foolish people. So
[29:23] rebellious and foolish and without
[29:25] understanding. It comes to this
[29:27] understanding, which have eyes and see
[29:29] not, which have ears and hear not,
[29:32] being foolish and rebellious. These are
[29:34] two of the strongest rebukes you could
[29:35] have in scripture.
[29:38] They lack the spiritual reasoning. In
[29:42] Psalms 115:6, they have ears, but they
[29:44] hear not. Noses have they, but they
[29:47] smell not. A twist. A COVID twist, so to
[29:51] speak. They had long co. It existed in
[29:54] Psalms 115.
[29:56] COVID 115.
[29:58] They have ears but they hear not. Noses
[30:01] have they but they smell not. What is a
[30:03] sensory input
[30:05] &gt;&gt; interpretation?
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Psalms 135:17. They have ears but they
[30:09] hear not. Neither is there any breath in
[30:11] their mouths. Now that escalated quickly
[30:13] because now he's saying they don't even
[30:14] have life.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to have a nose and not be
[30:17] able to smell. It's one thing to have
[30:18] have a lack of taste. It's one thing to
[30:21] uh to not be able to see or to hear. But
[30:22] now he's just saying, you know what?
[30:23] They're dead. For all intents and
[30:25] purposes, if someone cannot spiritually
[30:27] see, someone cannot spiritually hear,
[30:29] someone cannot spiritually taste,
[30:30] neither can someone spiritually smell,
[30:32] then they might as well be spiritually
[30:34] dead.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz what would you be if you lost all
[30:38] sensory input?
[30:41] &gt;&gt; You'd be living artificially.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; There's no breath in their mouths.
[30:49] Now, in amuseia, there's two different
[30:51] kinds of ammuzia. And I know you knew
[30:53] this. You're either born with it or you
[30:56] can acquire it later in life.
[31:02] In acquired amuseia, it's a musical
[31:06] disability that shares
[31:08] the same characteristics
[31:12] we'll come to in a moment. It has it's
[31:14] something that has happened rather than
[31:16] being inherited. It's the result of
[31:17] brain damage. which is the way they
[31:18] summarize it. And it's going to share
[31:20] the same characteristics of this other
[31:22] part, the congenital musia, which is by
[31:24] birth. The tonedeafness is another word
[31:27] we use. And I know we can maybe use that
[31:28] in harshly. And I think there's even a a
[31:31] phrase that's used uh socially now where
[31:33] someone is tonedeaf. Uh maybe they can't
[31:36] read the room or they're tonedeaf or
[31:37] somebody says something and it's it's
[31:39] not it kind of is not reading what's
[31:40] happening.
[31:42] This is a the to be congenal to be born
[31:45] congenital amusia is a musical
[31:47] disability that cannot be explained by
[31:49] prior injury, hearing loss, cognitive
[31:51] defects, or lack of environmental
[31:52] stimulation.
[31:54] So, they're diagnosed with amusia,
[31:56] they're born with it because you can't
[31:57] rule it out by injury or some impairment
[32:01] in hearing or cognitive defect or
[32:02] they're not it's not being they're not
[32:04] being stimulated in the environment.
[32:05] There's not another explanation. So,
[32:06] they say you can be born with it or it
[32:09] can happen by injury. I want us to think
[32:12] about this. I'm using this as a type. In
[32:14] other words, it's not like where is this
[32:15] unlocking? This truth hasn't been
[32:17] revealed to me. This is my liberty. No,
[32:19] this is just a type of the truth that
[32:20] have been preached to you for decades.
[32:22] Just using it to help us to understand
[32:24] better how uh uh understand the
[32:26] scripture better. So, you can be born
[32:28] with amuseia that inability to recognize
[32:32] to process and even recall music. Can't
[32:36] handle music. You can't don't recognize
[32:37] tones. You can't tell something's going
[32:39] up or down.
[32:41] music makes you uncomfortable or you
[32:43] find it annoying. Look at the spiritual
[32:44] type to this. In Psalms 58:es 3-5, the
[32:48] wicked are estranged from the womb. They
[32:50] go astray as soon as they are born,
[32:52] speaking lies. This is
[32:55] this is man born of a woman. Their
[32:57] poison is like the poison of a serpent.
[33:00] This this this these two scriptures here
[33:02] to me are there's a lot there. I've
[33:04] tried to just, you know, understand the
[33:06] full picture. Their poison is like the
[33:08] poison of a serpent. They are like the
[33:09] deaf adder that stopth her ear which
[33:12] will not hearken to the voice of the
[33:14] charmers charming never so wisely
[33:18] having they say about the deaf adder is
[33:20] there's no visible uh ear there's no ear
[33:25] ear canal there's nothing when you look
[33:26] at the deaf adder there's nothing say
[33:27] well this right here is their ear
[33:30] looking at scripture here in Psalm 58
[33:32] that has no ear but even their senses
[33:34] are dulled whereas an adder without ears
[33:38] could still be charmed by sound
[33:40] &gt;&gt; could be. And that's where the the plane
[33:42] of the
[33:44] right and you get the sound and all a
[33:45] sudden the the snake starts dancing. And
[33:48] so there's a way that that would happen.
[33:49] But now they're saying this one that
[33:51] would typically respond to some
[33:52] stimulus, some sound, some wave that
[33:55] would catch its attention. You could
[33:56] charm it and they could demonstrate this
[33:58] charming by way of music. It says now it
[34:00] has no ability to be affected by that
[34:05] intentional sound.
[34:08] And what the psalmist is saying this is
[34:10] the condition of the unsaved.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; The unsaved are like deaf adders that no
[34:15] matter no matter and something charming
[34:18] never so wisely. God declaring himself
[34:21] never so wisely. The word preached never
[34:24] so clearly. Signs and wonders
[34:25] demonstrated never so plainly. And yet
[34:28] they're have their deaf adders to where
[34:29] they're not even responding to that.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. no stimulus
[34:35] &gt;&gt; because they says they've stopped their
[34:37] ear.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; And the the point I'm wanting to make to
[34:41] all of us who are here today for
[34:43] ourselves examining ourselves is we can
[34:44] be spiritually tonedeaf by birth.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Because we haven't received a new birth.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; So you're you're spiritually tonedeaf
[34:55] deaf by birth.
[34:57] And it's only by the new birth that this
[35:00] this greater sensitivity if you have
[35:02] faith and doubt that reside inside the
[35:04] person just by way of explanation and as
[35:06] long as there's doubt there uh uh you
[35:08] can be animated and moved by other
[35:10] things. But it's when that dove nature
[35:12] begins to live out from inside the soul
[35:14] that's when you have an ear really
[35:16] &gt;&gt; an ear to hear.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; So there I cannot emphasize enough the
[35:22] necessity of a birth. Yes,
[35:25] &gt;&gt; I I know that maybe for myself I may
[35:27] emphasize a lot of understanding and
[35:29] knowing and a and increasing in
[35:32] revelation and knowledge and wisdom, but
[35:34] don't pursue it outside of birth.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; If you don't understand something, don't
[35:39] try with everything that's in you to
[35:41] understand it. Come to the foot of the
[35:43] cross. Lay bare and naked before him. If
[35:46] you believe there's a savior, if you
[35:48] believe blood has been shed for you, lay
[35:50] yourself bare before Christ and say,
[35:52] "I'm a sinner. I'm worthless. I'm
[35:54] deceived. I know nothing. And lay
[35:56] yourself there and ask God to give you
[35:58] the Holy Ghost.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Don't beat yourself your head up against
[36:03] an ecclesiastical door trying to break
[36:05] in to understand things
[36:08] &gt;&gt; that you may not even need to
[36:09] understand.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; You just need to know Christ.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; So, oh, but brother, what about the
[36:16] message? What about this? Don't you need
[36:17] to know the message? Well,
[36:21] you better know Christ.
[36:23] That's right.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; You got to know Christ. Otherwise, what
[36:25] we call the message could be something
[36:26] you don't want to know.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Right? There's a lot of uh uh paradigms
[36:31] of the message that you don't want to
[36:33] know.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; You'll run into somebody one day and
[36:35] you'll say, "Are you a believer?" And
[36:36] they'll say, "Yeah, I'm a believer. Oh
[36:38] my goodness, I can't believe it. I just
[36:39] knew by the way your dress is so
[36:40] awesome." You start talking like, "Whoa,
[36:42] hold on. Wait a minute. What? Huh?
[36:44] &gt;&gt; You mean the eighth messengers in Puerto
[36:46] Rico?
[36:48] You have a church of 8,000?" And all a
[36:50] sudden you realize the message means
[36:51] something completely different to them.
[36:53] Though they believe William Brandon was
[36:54] a prophet, it's a completely different
[36:56] paradigm.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Better know Christ.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; That's not what you've gotten out of the
[37:02] message. Well, revisit it.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; So it could be a lack of a birth. So the
[37:10] wicked are born spiritually death,
[37:12] spiritual death. But we can also have
[37:15] spiritual amuseia through trauma,
[37:18] &gt;&gt; damage to our hearts and minds.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; You're living your life and things make
[37:23] sense and everything's wonderful and
[37:25] life's just moving on and you just feel
[37:26] like this there's just another plateau
[37:29] after plateau and there's no there's no
[37:31] uh it's not that there's not dissonance
[37:33] and it's not that there's things don't
[37:34] happen. You go up and down and all of a
[37:35] sudden something traumatic happens.
[37:37] There's some injury to your heart.
[37:39] There's some buffeting. There's
[37:40] something that happens and it damages
[37:42] your mind and now the you become by
[37:45] injury
[37:47] you have amuseia
[37:50] where what you once enjoyed you can't
[37:52] enjoy anymore.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Once you once could hear and discern you
[37:55] can't discern it anymore.
[37:57] Everything's changed
[38:00] becomes dull or lifeless or annoying
[38:02] uncomfortable.
[38:05] In Luke 6:es 39-42,
[38:09] Jesus says he spake a parable unto them.
[38:11] You see the tie into what we've been
[38:12] reading. Can the blind lead the blind?
[38:15] Shall they not both fall into the ditch?
[38:17] And the answer is yes. The blind cannot
[38:19] lead the blind.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; The disciple is not above his master,
[38:23] but everyone that is perfect shall be as
[38:25] his master. So it applies to those
[38:27] who've made the blind their adviserss
[38:30] that they will also become as blind as
[38:34] their adviser. But then it also is if
[38:35] you make Christ your master then you
[38:37] will become as your master. And why
[38:39] beholdest thou the moat that is in thy
[38:41] brother's eye but perceivest not the
[38:44] beam that is in thy own? So now this has
[38:46] a this is about perception.
[38:48] You are seeing through a beam-filled eye
[38:53] and recognize that your brother has a
[38:56] sliver
[38:58] and you desire
[39:01] to remove it. Because he says, either
[39:04] how thou say to thy brother, brother,
[39:08] let me pull out the moat that is in
[39:10] thine eye when thou thyself beholdest
[39:13] not the beam that is in thy own eye.
[39:15] there's some lack of nakedness,
[39:17] self-awareness, v, you know, realizing,
[39:19] oh, I've got my own issues and I our own
[39:21] problems. I know a lot of times the
[39:22] devil may want to use that to keep us
[39:24] from speaking truth, keep us from living
[39:26] the way that we ought to live as, well,
[39:27] I've got my own problems, so I don't
[39:28] really want to say anything. Well, if
[39:30] you've got your own problems, it's good
[39:32] enough to look at those and question
[39:33] whether or not you would be the
[39:34] hypocrite by turning around saying,
[39:36] "Brother, that little splinter you got
[39:38] in your eye, man, you really need to do
[39:41] something about it. Meanwhile, you've
[39:43] got this 2x4.
[39:45] I was like, "Well, I got that splinter
[39:47] because the way you just turned around a
[39:48] moment ago and bumped up against that
[39:51] saw blade and a little splinter came out
[39:52] and got in my eye."
[39:56] Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam
[39:58] out of thine own eye, and then thou
[40:01] shalt thou shalt see clearly to pull out
[40:05] the moat that is in thy brother's eye.
[40:10] You maybe are not seeing clearly.
[40:13] Maybe things aren't as they appear. You
[40:15] see your brother, he's in a fault. He's
[40:16] doing something wrong. He's doing
[40:17] something he shouldn't do. I I don't
[40:18] like the I don't like what they did. I
[40:20] don't like the way this looks. And
[40:21] there's a lot of uh working up on your
[40:23] part. And it's like, well, you know
[40:24] what? I've got maybe I have something
[40:26] impairing my vision.
[40:29] Maybe I have something in the way.
[40:32] This is actually a response to the
[40:33] Pharisees who maybe were looking at
[40:35] these splinters or what they saw as
[40:37] flaws in Jesus Christ and were really
[40:39] nitpicky about him not washing his
[40:40] hands. But he's saying maybe you should
[40:42] think about the own bones within your
[40:44] heart,
[40:46] your dead heart, your deadness, your
[40:49] real lack of sincerity and all the
[40:51] pretense you engage in that you probably
[40:52] deep down know you're doing it. But you
[40:55] use all these felactories and use all
[40:56] these broadenings and use all this
[40:58] religious pretense as a guise for what's
[41:01] really in your heart.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; So he's saying why don't you examine the
[41:04] beam in your own eye first.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; And so here you could see that even in
[41:11] this way where one could be born as a
[41:15] snake is born without the physical ear.
[41:17] Let's say it's born without these
[41:18] ability to sound. It's a it's a
[41:20] congenital amuseia. there's an acquired
[41:22] amuseia where maybe something has
[41:24] lodged, there's been some injury,
[41:25] something has gotten in the way.
[41:29] And regardless of the cause,
[41:33] you say, "Well, does the person who gets
[41:35] the acquired amuseia, does that mean
[41:36] that they had it at one time?" Well, you
[41:39] may have been more sensitive at one
[41:40] time. You may have been more responsive.
[41:43] The seed in your heart may have been
[41:44] pulsating it a little bit more. That
[41:46] election might have been closer to you,
[41:47] more valuable to you. It might have been
[41:49] something that resonated with you and
[41:50] you liked the sound of it and you wanted
[41:52] to serve and you wanted to do these and
[41:53] it was there. It was pulsating. It was
[41:55] very very real. You couldn't deny it.
[41:56] But through the process of time that's
[41:58] dead now.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; And so what happened?
[42:01] &gt;&gt; It's the damage to the garden.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; It's the tears. It's the world.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; It really is honestly worldliness sewn
[42:09] into the spirit that eventually starts
[42:11] deadening the real spiritual gene.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it starts choking out the
[42:17] hunger. starts choking out
[42:20] &gt;&gt; uh the desire.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; And so even in that case, you say,
[42:25] "Well, you you need to be born again.
[42:26] You still need to be born again." And
[42:28] there's some even being born again, they
[42:30] suffer trauma and damage and they find
[42:31] themselves struggling and the word's not
[42:33] resonating. There's things that they
[42:34] have to go through. But regardless, if
[42:36] you have received
[42:39] or born with this amusia and you've just
[42:41] been uh and it's never resonated, you
[42:43] don't know it, you still need to know
[42:44] Christ by birth. Or if there's something
[42:46] that you've acquired along the way,
[42:48] &gt;&gt; there's healing for amusia.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about ears and eyes and
[42:54] nose.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; These are all and even the breath and
[42:56] the mouth. Maybe there's a way that you
[42:58] could tie it to taste, but all reference
[43:00] domains of human cognitive ability,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; some cognition that processes sensory
[43:06] input
[43:07] &gt;&gt; physically. When you touch something and
[43:10] you say, "Is that as smooth or rough?"
[43:12] Because you have the ability not only to
[43:15] to feel it here, but then to know by
[43:19] processing input, hot, cold, rough,
[43:21] smooth,
[43:23] &gt;&gt; ears, eyes, sensory input.
[43:28] And as some of you might have thought,
[43:32] you might have thought that I was
[43:33] meaning to say amnesia, but in this way
[43:35] amuseia is a lot like amnesia.
[43:40] Amnesia can happen is many different
[43:42] ways we could look at this, but it's a
[43:44] loss of memory
[43:46] from trauma or shock, physical or
[43:49] emotional trauma, where one cannot
[43:52] remember certain things. They they
[43:54] they've lost their reasoning. they've
[43:55] lost their identity. It can be very very
[43:57] vast where they don't even know who they
[43:58] are. They have the inability to form new
[44:00] memories. There might be just very few
[44:02] memories that they hold on to. But this
[44:03] amnesia is damage to the the mind.
[44:09] And so amusia and amnesia. Now I think
[44:12] I'm in familiar territory, but maybe
[44:13] this way you'll be able to catch where
[44:15] I've been trying to work from this whole
[44:17] time. They're both a disruption in the
[44:19] brain's ability to process, store, or
[44:22] recall or retrieve information. Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Processing, storing, and retrieving.
[44:26] When you have amnesia, you you're not
[44:29] processing, storing, and retrieving.
[44:30] Somewhere in that, it's broken down.
[44:31] When you have amusia, you're not able to
[44:34] process
[44:36] the uh the the the information stored or
[44:38] retrieve it accurately.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amusia impairs perception, reproduction
[44:42] of musical pitch or melody.
[44:45] A song registers as a flat sequence or
[44:48] sounds without emotional or structural
[44:50] coherence. It means nothing.
[44:52] You hear, "Oh, solia." And you're just
[44:54] like,
[44:58] "Whose phone is going off? There's this
[45:00] droning in the background. It's annoying
[45:02] me. It's like fingernails on a
[45:03] chalkboard." Or maybe that didn't even
[45:04] bother him. I don't know.
[45:07] This is what it is. When you have
[45:08] amusia, then amnesia involves a loss or
[45:10] or the inability to form certain
[45:12] memories.
[45:13] A familiar face or even an event uh is
[45:17] devoid of personal context. you see
[45:19] someone's face, nothing doesn't trigger
[45:20] anything.
[45:22] There there's there's something that
[45:24] takes place where there's no meaning
[45:26] associated with what you're seeing. And
[45:29] each one of these the the cognitive or
[45:31] or the sensory and the cognitive system
[45:33] is still intact
[45:35] structurally.
[45:37] But yet those specialized neural
[45:39] pathways in your brain that are supposed
[45:41] to fire off and recognize a a and and
[45:44] begin to integrate these interpret
[45:46] integrate information, they're
[45:47] compromised. One time you could
[45:49] interpret this. Oh, that's the face of
[45:51] my dad. I could interpret that's the
[45:52] voice of my mom. There's things that
[45:54] could happen and things fired off. But
[45:55] then something gets compromised and what
[45:57] at one time was familiar now is
[45:58] disfamiliar.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; One thing that was pleasing at one time
[46:02] is now no longer pleasing. And so both
[46:05] conditions, I I want you to recognize
[46:06] this. Both conditions as we think you're
[46:08] you're reversed in what spiritual
[46:10] amnesia is. Both of these conditions are
[46:12] less about the absence of sensory input
[46:14] or information, but it's about the
[46:16] interpretation.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; It's not that new information is being
[46:20] presented. It's not that there's now uh
[46:22] things that you'd never heard or seen
[46:24] before, but now they don't hear the
[46:25] same.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Now you don't see them the same.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; It's a breakdown of the mind and
[46:30] translating that input into a meaningful
[46:33] experience or something that makes
[46:34] sense.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:42] And both if you have amuseia, you could
[46:45] be listening to something
[46:47] that others find rich with significance
[46:50] and sound and meaning and color. Even
[46:53] when it comes to amnesia, looking at
[46:54] something that to others it has a lot of
[46:56] context, a lot of meaning is very
[46:57] powerful. All the same cues, all the
[47:00] same evidence, but those cues fail to
[47:02] connect
[47:03] &gt;&gt; to these internal frameworks. Yeah,
[47:06] &gt;&gt; that make them resonate.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Some people have experienced this with
[47:11] loved ones who begin to develop
[47:13] dementia.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; They they they can see just as good as
[47:17] they've ever seen. They can hear just as
[47:20] good as they've ever heard before. But
[47:22] the voice isn't familiar.
[47:26] The face isn't familiar. The signal is
[47:29] present, but somehow in the reception,
[47:32] the meaning is lost.
[47:36] the spiritual amnesia, spiritual amusia.
[47:41] It's either a birth defect or a heart
[47:43] injury.
[47:46] It's either something you've never had
[47:49] or something that's been impaired.
[47:52] In Isaiah chapter 42 16 to 20, "And I
[47:55] will bring the blind by a way that they
[47:57] knew not. I will lead them in paths that
[48:00] they have not known. and I will make
[48:01] darkness light before them and crooked
[48:03] things straight. These things will I do
[48:05] unto them and not forsake them. He's
[48:08] talking to you.
[48:10] If there was a people that was
[48:11] considered blind and reprobate and
[48:13] heathen, it was the the Israel or excuse
[48:15] me, it was the Gentiles to Israel. And
[48:18] then it says, they shall be turned back,
[48:19] they shall be greatly ashamed that trust
[48:21] in graven images that say to the molten
[48:23] images, ye are our God. So there must be
[48:25] a change in paradigm. To the heathen, he
[48:27] cannot continue to worship a false god.
[48:30] and God lead him in the way that is
[48:31] true. So they that are turned back and
[48:34] go back to false uh these false images,
[48:39] they will uh they will not they will be
[48:41] greatly ashamed. So he says, "Hear ye
[48:43] deaf." Now that seems to be quite a a
[48:46] rough statement. If you're deaf, he's
[48:48] telling you to hear. Blind, look that
[48:50] you may see. Who is blind but my
[48:53] servant? Or deaf is my messenger that I
[48:55] sent. He's talking about Israel. This is
[48:56] about Israel, the Jews, the religious
[48:58] system. Who who is blind is he that is
[49:01] perfect and blind is the Lord's servant
[49:02] servant seeing many things but thou
[49:05] observest not opening the ears but he
[49:06] heareth not. There's your prophecy of a
[49:09] blind people without light of people
[49:11] without God being called in and the eyes
[49:12] of Israel being blinded for the Gentiles
[49:15] sake.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; The noble vine, the true vine. But
[49:18] notice he says they shall be turned back
[49:21] that trust engraven images that say to
[49:23] the multi- images ye are gods. What is
[49:25] this? It's the sin of imagination
[49:28] where they're perceiving life or truth
[49:30] and things that are false,
[49:32] not real. Therefore, it's imagined. The
[49:36] images, the molten images,
[49:40] the graven images, they're they're
[49:42] they're not gods. They've been fashioned
[49:44] by their own hands. But what do they
[49:45] tell themselves? They see it and they
[49:46] claim it is a god. It's a sin of
[49:49] imagination.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; But he says, "I will bring the blind by
[49:53] the way that they didn't know. I will
[49:54] lead them in paths they have not yet
[49:56] known before. I will make darkness light
[49:58] before them and crooked things straight.
[50:01] These things will I do unto them and not
[50:03] forsake them. God's promised healing
[50:06] &gt;&gt; for amnesia,
[50:08] &gt;&gt; amusia,
[50:09] &gt;&gt; sin, blindness, deafness,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; in Exodus 4:1, when Moses is choosing
[50:16] desiring not to speak,
[50:19] God says, the Lord said to him, "Who
[50:20] hath made man's mouth? Who h who maketh
[50:23] the dumb or deaf or the seen or the
[50:25] blind? Have not I the Lord? Who
[50:28] ultimately has responsibility over this?
[50:31] Who has power over blindness? Who has
[50:34] power over deafness? Who has power over
[50:37] the dumb?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; God does.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; The ministry of Christ is healing of the
[50:42] heart to see and to hear. In Matthew
[50:46] chapter 13 14-16
[50:49] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[50:50] Isaiah which sayeth by hearing you shall
[50:52] hear and shall not understand and you
[50:54] shall see and shall not perceive for the
[50:57] people's heart is waxed gross and their
[50:59] ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
[51:01] they have closed lest at any time they
[51:03] should see with their eyes and hear with
[51:04] their ears and should understand with
[51:06] their heart and should be converted and
[51:08] I should heal them. Where is it? It's
[51:10] necessary for conversion, for new life,
[51:12] to come to know Christ, there must be a
[51:15] hearing of the word.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; So those ears that are stopped, those
[51:19] eyes that are blind, those that have a
[51:21] heart that is waxed gross, and the eyes
[51:24] that are closed and ears that won't
[51:25] hear, they're the ones who cannot
[51:28] understand and be saved.
[51:32] And I could read that and I could say
[51:33] that's an unfair God that would do that.
[51:38] Because if hearing is the only way that
[51:40] I can have understanding and God's got
[51:42] to do that,
[51:43] &gt;&gt; then then it's really doesn't seem fair
[51:46] if I remain in my ignorance and in my
[51:48] blindness.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; I guess if I was in that position, I'd
[51:52] want to fall on the mercy of God.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; They say, "Lord, don't let me be blind.
[51:56] Don't let me be deaf." Amen.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; So then he says verse 16, "But blessed
[52:01] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[52:03] for they hear."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Blessed are your eyes
[52:07] &gt;&gt; for they see and your ears for they
[52:08] hear. Who does that? That's God.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; If you can't hear, if you don't think
[52:13] you can hear, if you can't see, don't
[52:14] think you can see, who should you ask
[52:16] for for understanding?
[52:17] &gt;&gt; God.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; In the sermon, hear his voice. Brother
[52:21] says, "So many things to dole the senses
[52:24] of the people today. Oh, but in the
[52:26] midst of all that, in spite of every
[52:30] doulling in every voice that's in the
[52:31] world today, some of them pleasure
[52:33] voices, some of them are sinful voices
[52:34] to lure the people. But in spite of
[52:36] every bit of that, the truth of God
[52:39] still remains.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; There are voices there in the world
[52:44] today at work, at school, on the job, in
[52:46] entertainment, music, all sorts of
[52:48] places. There's voices that are trying
[52:50] to damage your sensory input, trying to
[52:52] damage your processing of information.
[52:54] There's all sorts of voices that are
[52:56] trying to dull spiritual sense.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, spiritual amnesia is real.
[53:01] Spiritual amnesia is real.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; And you know the grace in spiritual
[53:05] amnesia, the grace in spiritual amnesia
[53:07] is just you've forgotten who you really
[53:09] are.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; It's not saying that you can never be
[53:13] who you never were. It's saying you've
[53:14] forgotten who you really are. That if
[53:16] you're acting disconcorted, if you're
[53:18] acting in a way that's not true, if
[53:19] you're acting in a way that's contrary
[53:20] to the word of God, it's not because
[53:22] you're serpent seed. It's not because
[53:24] you're a reprobate heathen that's not
[53:26] elect to a new birth. You've just
[53:27] forgotten the power of God's word to
[53:30] deliver you and raise you above all
[53:32] these base things that you can't seem to
[53:34] overcome.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; The truth of God still remains. He that
[53:38] will hear my voice and come after him.
[53:41] Men and women will hear the voice of
[53:42] God. God still waits to speak to every
[53:46] individual that'll open their ears to
[53:49] hear God's voice.
[53:52] So now we understand when that deaf
[53:56] adder stops her ear, they refuse to
[54:00] listen.
[54:06] But anyone that'll open their ears to
[54:08] hear God's voice,
[54:11] if you will seek me, he said with your
[54:12] whole heart,
[54:13] &gt;&gt; you'll find me.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I believe that to be the truth. Yeah.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; For anyone,
[54:20] &gt;&gt; anyone. Brother Aaron, you really think
[54:21] someone in Islam and in Iran right now
[54:23] could truly seek the Lord with their
[54:25] whole heart and find him? Yes, I do
[54:26] because the Bible tells me that.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 12:es 1-2,
[54:36] we're just bringing this to our our
[54:37] close here.
[54:40] Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[54:43] about with so great a cloud of
[54:44] witnesses, let us lay aside every
[54:46] weight, and the sin which doth so easily
[54:49] beset us, and let us run with patience
[54:52] the race that is set before us.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Let us lay aside. Yeah.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Let them alone."
[55:02] Every weight, every sin,
[55:05] the sin of pride and pretense, the sin
[55:07] of sin of popularity,
[55:10] the sin of of money and women. There's a
[55:13] lot of things that draw on us. Got to
[55:15] recognize things. Just scripturally
[55:17] recognize these things. These things
[55:18] that war against the soul, the things
[55:20] that war against the spiritual
[55:22] conscience, the things that war against
[55:24] the spiritual mind to cause spiritual
[55:26] amusia,
[55:27] the things that are trying to deaden our
[55:29] senses to cause spiritual amnesia. Lay
[55:31] aside every weight and the sin which
[55:32] does so easily beset us, and let us run
[55:34] with patience the race that is set for
[55:36] us, looking unto Jesus, the author and
[55:38] finisher of our faith. He must be the
[55:40] one that begins it. And therefore, we
[55:42] must be reliant upon him to finish it
[55:44] and perfect it. For who for the joy
[55:46] which was set before him endured the
[55:47] cross, despising the shame, and is set
[55:49] down at the right hand of the throne of
[55:50] God.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Says looking away, looking unto Jesus
[55:53] means to look away from a one thing to
[55:55] another.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Doesn't do us good enough just to take
[55:58] our eyes off of what's distracting us
[56:01] and take our eyes off of those things
[56:02] that are dark and those things we don't
[56:03] understand. We're just going to take our
[56:04] eyes off these things. Jesus wouldn't
[56:06] tell them, uh, look not upon them. Let
[56:08] them alone about the Pharisees and then
[56:10] just begin to let your eyes wonder
[56:12] because you'll find another Pharisee.
[56:13] That's right.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; But look unto me.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Look unto Jesus
[56:20] &gt;&gt; and laying aside every weight and the
[56:21] sin which does so easily beset us. This
[56:23] is a call to guard your heart from all
[56:25] the inputs of the world that force us
[56:27] and push us.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; We must turn our attention away from the
[56:31] world to the word.
[56:35] Truly the source of any righteousness,
[56:38] the any any circumspectness, anything
[56:40] that we would have in our flesh, any
[56:42] testimony or any life, the source of
[56:44] that comes from this internal beholding
[56:47] Christ.
[56:49] Think we read it by Awtoer here recently
[56:52] how that as much as we could say all
[56:54] these things, the scripture, my
[56:55] goodness, the New Testament, most of it
[56:56] deals with things external.
[56:59] All of Jesus's parables, these things
[57:00] are all relating to things external,
[57:02] &gt;&gt; things natural. Paul's teaching every
[57:04] all this all these outward things.
[57:08] Even Paul Peter when he's addressing
[57:10] modesty
[57:12] he says it's he even speaks to a modesty
[57:15] not just a spirit but not in the the way
[57:17] that you dress
[57:20] a and calls out certain things. There's
[57:22] ways that there's it has to be with this
[57:25] internal beholding though first the
[57:27] purity of heart manifest in purity of
[57:29] life.
[57:31] Now this is the this is maybe the the
[57:33] little bit of the inversion here at the
[57:35] end. Then
[57:38] if we have spiritual amuseia to where
[57:40] Christ
[57:42] speaks
[57:44] and he says you know it's better you
[57:46] know really it's more of what's in your
[57:48] heart that's going to that it comes out
[57:50] of your heart that speaks as to whether
[57:51] or not a man is defiled such as murder
[57:53] and lying and blasphemy as opposed to
[57:56] whether or not he ate with unclean
[57:57] hands. If you hear that and you're
[57:59] tonedeaf to it, you're like, "Oh, that
[58:01] offends me."
[58:04] And the very word of God is offensive,
[58:07] makes you uncomfortable.
[58:09] If that can be so to the word, well,
[58:12] then you know what? I want it to be that
[58:14] way with the world.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; I want to be tonedeaf.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Just follow me though.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; To the devil.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; To sin.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; To the flesh. Come on.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; To the world.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Good.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; I want that whenever I hear like, "Oh, I
[58:31] that doesn't sit well with me. I I don't
[58:33] know. I don't know if that's coming or
[58:34] going."
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's exactly how the
[58:36] world is, right?
[58:39] &gt;&gt; They look at you and say, "Man, I love
[58:41] you so much. Come give me a hug." Right?
[58:44] And it's like,
[58:48] "Oh, man. Can you scratch my back?" And
[58:50] they're like, "Yeah, I'd love to."
[58:52] Right?
[58:55] The world
[58:57] You can't trust the world.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not and I'm not talking about a
[59:02] lack of spiritual discernment, but a a a
[59:05] deafness. I'm so in I want to be in tune
[59:07] to righteousness. I want to be in tune
[59:09] to heaven. I want to be in tune to the
[59:11] word. I want to be in tune to Christ. I
[59:13] want that tuning to be the contrast to
[59:15] the world.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; I I don't want to start building
[59:18] categories and pick up a rock and go,
[59:20] "Oh, well, this one's the world." And
[59:21] pick up another rock and look at say,
[59:22] "Well, this one's of God."
[59:24] I I when we I go on hikes out there in
[59:27] Arizona and everywhere I'm looking like
[59:29] that's got to be a valuable rock. That's
[59:30] got to be a valuable rock. That's oh my
[59:31] goodness, this looks so amazing. See all
[59:32] the greens in that? See the pink in
[59:34] this? And everywhere I'm looking I go I
[59:35] live right next to a gold mine. I'm like
[59:38] how come people aren't in here just
[59:39] taking this and polishing them and
[59:41] storing them? I don't have any ability
[59:42] to know what's really valuable or not.
[59:46] And somebody who knows what's real,
[59:49] invaluable, can walk through a bunch of
[59:51] impostors and a bunch of shiny things
[59:54] and they're not saying that's fake,
[59:55] that's fake, that's fake. They just
[59:56] recognize something genuine. Say, "Come
[59:58] here. I want to show you something. Look
[59:59] at this.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; I want to be so in tune to the richness
[1:00:03] of the rock. I want to be so in tune to
[1:00:05] the richness of the blood. I want to be
[1:00:06] so in tune with the richness of Christ
[1:00:08] that I'm not in the habit of trying to
[1:00:10] call out everybody who's a Revelations
[1:00:11] 3:17. I want to hear the voice of Christ
[1:00:14] who's knocking at the door.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; I want to be in tune to righteousness,
[1:00:18] heaven, the word, and Christ. Not just,
[1:00:20] oh, that's sin. That's the world. That's
[1:00:21] the flesh of the devil. Give me more of
[1:00:23] Jesus.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; So in tune to him that I become tonedeaf
[1:00:28] to the rest of the world.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And the sermon, show us the father and
[1:00:32] it'll satisfy us. There's the heart's
[1:00:33] desire. Philip, show if I could just see
[1:00:36] the father, that'll that'll that'll be
[1:00:38] everything. Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You realize just how many perplexities
[1:00:43] life has?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm asking you, do you
[1:00:46] realize, and some of you saying you
[1:00:47] don't even know the half of it, Brother
[1:00:48] Aaron,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; life is perplexing, paradoxical,
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; and all the other P-words we can come up
[1:00:54] with. It's rough.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; The things that we have to endure and go
[1:00:59] through, it's it's it's a complex life
[1:01:02] is now even more complicated than it's
[1:01:03] ever been before. The only thing that's
[1:01:04] going to resolve that's Christ."
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:07] Life's full of paradoxes. Some will be
[1:01:09] resolved to be false and some will be
[1:01:12] resolved to be true. But the only
[1:01:13] resolution you'll ever find is in
[1:01:15] Christ.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Oh my, that's what
[1:01:19] we want to do." Rise above it. Pull away
[1:01:22] from them people that says there's no
[1:01:23] such a thing as divine healing. God
[1:01:25] doesn't keep his word. Jesus Christ is
[1:01:26] not the same yesterday, today, and
[1:01:28] forever. Just set your wings in the
[1:01:30] power of God and move away.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Just that talking about that chatter of
[1:01:34] the chipmunk.
[1:01:36] Get out of sight. Leave them alone.
[1:01:38] Leave them set alone. Just be so deaf.
[1:01:42] You don't even hear them at all.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; That's a miracle.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine the miracle? Someone
[1:01:47] says, "Oh, did you did you hear the
[1:01:50] Pharisees? The Pharisees were offended."
[1:01:52] And like, "Oh, God did a miracle. I'm
[1:01:54] deaf. He made me deaf."
[1:01:58] I remember when Sister Elizabeth and I
[1:02:00] were we had been courting and then she
[1:02:02] broke up with me and uh I wrote her a
[1:02:05] letter just pining for her affection and
[1:02:08] she wrote back and said, "God did the
[1:02:09] greatest thing he's ever done for me
[1:02:10] ever. She got a new puppy."
[1:02:14] I'm like, "Okay, all right. Well,
[1:02:15] appreciate it." Another time I she said,
[1:02:18] "Oh, brother Aaron, one of this may be
[1:02:19] the first time this happened when she
[1:02:20] broke up with me." The first time she
[1:02:23] said, "God did the greatest thing for
[1:02:24] she's testifying. It was on a Wednesday
[1:02:25] night. I can tell you right where I was,
[1:02:27] where I was in my car driving. God just
[1:02:29] did the greatest thing for me. So
[1:02:30] wonderful. I just don't know how much I
[1:02:31] could thank him, but God took all my
[1:02:33] feelings for you away.
[1:02:37] What are the greatest miracles? It's in
[1:02:38] her miracle book. Number one,
[1:02:42] it just goes to prove, you know,
[1:02:43] sometimes you can lose your healing.
[1:02:47] You don't stay focused on Christ. Next
[1:02:49] thing you know, you're in love with him
[1:02:50] again.
[1:02:56] But this is the miracle of it. Sometimes
[1:02:57] that's the paradox. The very things that
[1:02:59] are, you know, it's like, you know,
[1:03:01] heartbreaking to the guy driving home
[1:03:02] from church that night, uh, is
[1:03:05] liberating to somebody else. But here's
[1:03:06] the miracle. Just be so deaf.
[1:03:09] You don't even hear them at all. Just
[1:03:11] move away from it. He says, "God is in
[1:03:13] his universe. God moves amongst his
[1:03:15] creatures.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; God is real. There's a true God. He's
[1:03:19] real.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. He's the God that wrote this
[1:03:22] Bible. You can believe it.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; This Bible is our absolute.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't follow the message
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; and this Bible not be your absolute.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; You're cherrypicking at that point.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; So God is real. And so he says just
[1:03:40] become deaf to all the outside noise.
[1:03:43] Right?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; This deafness
[1:03:49] to the things of God, this inability to
[1:03:51] to to feel it, it can happen because
[1:03:54] we're not even giving ourselves a
[1:03:55] chance.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; You can avail yourself so much. We're
[1:03:59] talking about this in uh the sympathetic
[1:04:00] resonance and resonance to where if
[1:04:02] you're not tuned correctly, you can
[1:04:04] avail yourself to the elements, to the
[1:04:05] heat, to the moisture, to the humidity.
[1:04:07] You can be so uh wore down by the world
[1:04:10] that whenever the word starts sounding,
[1:04:12] it doesn't do anything to you.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're not praying and
[1:04:16] reading your Bible. You're not listening
[1:04:18] to the message of the hour. So, it's
[1:04:20] going to sound foreign to you.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You're not tuned to it.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I say this morning, I go
[1:04:26] through all this this morning because I
[1:04:27] believe in a God who is the same
[1:04:29] yesterday, today, and forever. And still
[1:04:31] heals of amnesia, still heals of
[1:04:34] amuseia, still heal heals those who
[1:04:36] can't hear, and can heal those who can't
[1:04:39] see.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God. In Mark chapter 9:2, when
[1:04:43] Jesus saw that that the people came
[1:04:45] running together, he rebuked the foul
[1:04:47] spirit, saying him, "Thou dumb and deaf
[1:04:50] spirit, I charge thee, come out of him,
[1:04:52] and enter no more into him." What is it?
[1:04:54] It's a spirit.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Doctors can identify a part of the brain
[1:04:58] that's been injured. They can identify a
[1:05:00] certain hindrance to the tongue. They
[1:05:02] could see a certain damage to the ear
[1:05:04] and to the eye. There's a lot of things
[1:05:05] they can diagnose, but at the end of the
[1:05:07] day, the spirit of God is greater than
[1:05:10] that spirit that resides in the injury.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; And God, the word is greater than any
[1:05:16] dumb and deaf spirit.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Spiritual amuseia. Do you understand
[1:05:21] what I'm referring to now?
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; As we invite our musicians to come, I'd
[1:05:25] like to read this last statement from
[1:05:26] Perfect Faith.
[1:05:30] And so when a man lives by faith and
[1:05:31] walks by faith,
[1:05:35] Lord willing, on Wednesday night, I want
[1:05:36] to preach on like the key to escape in
[1:05:38] using that type of a key, a cleft,
[1:05:41] something uh that is the guiding guiding
[1:05:46] track. And so when a man lives by faith
[1:05:48] and walks by faith, there's your it's
[1:05:50] that substance faith.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; It's a key. He is isolated from the
[1:05:54] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:05:56] in Christ. Now you're getting into bride
[1:05:59] material. You're getting into rapturing
[1:06:01] condition. That means for each one of
[1:06:03] us, not just the pastor, deacons and
[1:06:05] trustees. That means for the leoty,
[1:06:08] every individual walks in a world with
[1:06:10] God alone.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; This is the opposite of DEI.
[1:06:18] This is DIIE.
[1:06:20] Right?
[1:06:23] We're we're not striving for striving
[1:06:25] for diversity, equity, and inclusion so
[1:06:26] that we can just be more of us. But this
[1:06:30] is dying to self. I need to die.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; So that I can walk with God.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; You are baptized in this kingdom.
[1:06:38] There's nobody in there but you and God.
[1:06:39] He gives the orders. You pack them out.
[1:06:40] Whatever he says, there's not a shadow
[1:06:42] of doubt nowhere. You walk right on. If
[1:06:44] the Lord says this, there's nobody in
[1:06:46] the world can talk you out of it. You go
[1:06:48] right on just the same.
[1:06:50] Now you're coming into perfect faith.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Perfect perfection that cannot fail.
[1:06:56] That faith never fails. And speaking of
[1:06:58] Christ, he was a mystic to them with his
[1:07:00] perfect faith. And so it is now with
[1:07:02] those who have perfect faith are a
[1:07:04] mystic to others. May be offensive. May
[1:07:07] not be able to understand. You may see
[1:07:09] you may appear to be tonedeaf to them.
[1:07:13] We're taught to resist the devil and he
[1:07:14] will flee. To resist is to simply turn
[1:07:17] him down. just resist him. Just walk
[1:07:22] away from it. Now, I know that this is
[1:07:27] different.
[1:07:30] And I sure wish that resistance training
[1:07:33] was the same as resisting the devil cuz
[1:07:36] I it's not hard for me to walk away from
[1:07:37] weights at all.
[1:07:40] It's like I'm just I'm going to walk
[1:07:42] away from those dumbbells. You're just
[1:07:43] going to stay there and get dusty and
[1:07:45] somehow get the strength and overcome
[1:07:47] it. No. If you're going to get any
[1:07:49] benefit from those weights, you have to
[1:07:50] lift them. But here, the success of
[1:07:53] resisting the devil is not just how many
[1:07:55] times you can rep him.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You know what's your personal best in
[1:07:58] hoisting Satan? No. Walk away.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Just walk away. God said a certain
[1:08:05] thing. No matter what he's trying to
[1:08:06] tell you, you don't listen to him. Your
[1:08:08] ears are deaf to anything else but what
[1:08:11] the spirit says.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; To he that has an ear that listens, see
[1:08:15] what the spirit saith unto the churches.
[1:08:17] And the one thing that's got the list
[1:08:20] that the one that's got the listening
[1:08:23] post that catches what the spirit says
[1:08:26] to the churches.
[1:08:28] The listening post. The one that can
[1:08:31] receive
[1:08:33] what the spirit is saying. I think that
[1:08:36] there should be some tuning out to the
[1:08:38] things of this world.
[1:08:40] Tuning out to the base things. Now, I
[1:08:43] think that this works in perfect
[1:08:44] complement to what we've been
[1:08:46] ministering on. staring into the void,
[1:08:49] into the darkness and the difficult
[1:08:51] things. Because I'm not we're not
[1:08:53] talking about things that uh the
[1:08:55] darkness and the nakedness and saying,
[1:08:56] "Well, I'm just going to walk away." No.
[1:08:58] Uh-uh. We're talking about the world,
[1:09:00] sin, the flesh, the devil. There's a lot
[1:09:02] of things that look like darkness that
[1:09:04] that's the thing you're going to have to
[1:09:05] stare into to find God.
[1:09:08] But you're not going to find him in the
[1:09:09] world.
[1:09:11] You're
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; not going to find them in the thoughts
[1:09:12] of this flesh. You're not going to find
[1:09:13] him in the devil. You're not going to
[1:09:15] find him as sin, but you'll find him as
[1:09:17] looking into your own void, your own
[1:09:19] weakness, your own heart, your own
[1:09:20] questions, your own vulnerabilities,
[1:09:21] your own nakedness
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; at the foot of the cross. One of the
[1:09:24] ugliest scenes in the Bible. May God
[1:09:27] help us to walk with perfect faith.
