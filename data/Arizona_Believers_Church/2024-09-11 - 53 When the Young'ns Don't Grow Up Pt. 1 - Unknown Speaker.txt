TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what a great place to uh pick back up in this series on the house of the Lord after having ministered on the big three to read this scripture wherein it says that these three abideth faith hope and charity and then it says the greatest of these is Charity a lot there for us to think about and consider and tonight having this opportunity to do this on a Wednesday night I like it because then I feel like I can go uh approach a new subject from just a little bit different angle uh maybe a little bit more depth in the word of God and some material that I know that you can handle I don't say that about that the Sunday morning crowd can't handle it but sometimes you just have a little bit more people you maybe have some different visitors and you might have a different burden um on a Sunday morning Believe It or Not pastors can be filled just directed a little bit differently based upon the service and with your midweek uh group that faithful core that's always there every single service just feel that there's a lot that we can get into and not um and really strike a real chord for you so I appreciate your patience tonight as we begin a new subject my title for this uh for the next foreseeable future is when the youngans don't grow up and I think that uh there's just a lot that you can gather from that title you might even be able to gather it quite a bit just from my slide I chose to put together uh when the young ons don't grow up you may recognize the font anybody know what font this is Calvin and Hobs font and uh that's a picture of a little bit older Calvin holding Hobs uh and maybe perhaps thinking am I too old for this but I want to begin to look at subjects of emotional and spiritual maturity and so I'm telling you everything up front so that as we go forward never forget what it is that we're targeting and what we feel the Lord is dealing with us on and at really at the heart of that we talk about emotional and spiritual maturity in our minds we might start thinking well this is 12 steps to living a better life or um this is psychology which I think is just one of the PWS that the devil likes to throw around a lot of times but that's not it at all uh it's a different PW of purpose and the purpose of the word of God in this hour I think sometimes it's missing uh we just kind of forget that well these things have happened and this has happened and God's doing this and God's doing that instead of taking a step back and thinking about how God is very deliberate when he does something that God does something to achieve something else he's always moving towards the kingdom and there's always a Perfection that he's trying to bring that there's a vision for the word when it's revealed and there's a vision for the word in this time and maybe even more importantly using this uh this phrase when the youngans don't grow up uh that what is the age that we're living in what what's the time that we're living in what's the mark of this age and what's the purpose of the word of God in this age now if you look at our text I'd like to start with verse eight again let start here uh I have a lot of things to cover in this uh in this service but yet uh we can just hold over till Sunday if we not able to get to all of it verse 8 says charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish Away Paul has already said a lot in this chapter to challenge um a lot of our assumptions and Notions about certain things I know for me personally when he says though I understand all Mysteries and have not charity I am nothing that that really hits at the core of maybe some of the things that we really love or we hold very dear and I think it's important to recognize that he's speaking maybe in a rhetorical way and not necessarily wanting us to uh wouldn't want us to turn it into something that he's not meaning but yet he's wanting to get our attention and then he says charity never fails and says prophecies will fail and tongues will cease and knowledge will vanish away and that's some uh some pretty heavy things to say especially to this Corinthian Church he says for we know in part and we prophesy in part so it's not the prophesying and the knowing the gift of knowledge the word of knowledge the prophesying he is saying that it's it's just partial it's not the fullness he says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away now Paul begins to prophesy and his Revelation then was prophecy for today so the very things that are being revealed to him and the mark of perfection and that which is perfect will come and when we uh when it shall turn to the Lord all all these different things this Revelation that Paul preached and he preached it so imminent that this is the last days and and this is the time that we're living in uh this is revelation for the time that we're living in when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child now it's important to recognize that he hasn't just Paul didn't all a sudden transition out of a sermon into another one and now he's given his life story and he's left the thought of perfection behind and he's not talking about charity anymore but he he and it's like Paul is slipping again he's going back and telling child stories no he's saying with this is an image of what this Perfection is when I was a child I spake as a child tongues word of knowledge prophecy he said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child notice just the symmetry of those three with the tongues the prophesying and the knowledge he's saying these things are in part he says but when I became a man I put away childish things he says for now we see through a glass Darkly every time I read that I think of my dad my precious dad Brother David McGary who always says a glass darkling and so I it's hard for me not to read that I joked around that because of his spelling we believed in the Holy Sprite for years but now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known there's a lot that I want to would love just to even right now begin to unpack and put before you in a slide and drill into what these words mean and more in the context of what Paul is saying especially the audience that he's saying it too I believe brother brandham said this is the Pentecostal church that he's correcting he says when I was a child that word is translated to babe in the scripture uh some of the working titles I had for this uh these this subject as I've studied over the last several months is when the babies don't grow up or when the babies don't grow up or mature and so when I was a child or babe or childish is another word that it's translated to and it means these different things an infant a little child a toddler a miner one that is not of age so you realize when I was a child it doesn't necessarily mean when I was three or when I was 12 but it could actually mean this whole time period of wherein there's what you would expect of a 2-year-old is certainly not what you would expect of a 12-year-old and if you got from a 2-year-old what you would expect from a 12-year-old it would shock you right and but then sometimes when our 13-year-olds act like 2-year-olds we're not surprised cuz we saw that before from them but yet there is a um an infant a little child a minor one that is not of age that covers quite a lot of ground especially to a Hebrew that you could say there was these different junctures wherein uh uh in just in the language of a Hebrew and within Israel there's different junctures that one would come to even up to 30 years old the word also means untaught or unskilled and it's not that they wouldn't have any skill or that they wouldn't uh be taught at all but yet when one is at a certain age and they're not of age or they're a child or they're a minor or they're an infant then there's not uh they haven't learned or been taught they haven't gone through different seasons of life to uh uh wrestle with certain things or be exposed I haven't been awakened to things and so there hasn't been the consecutive years of teaching there hasn't been the consecutive years of putting into practice what one has been taught so it really means a lot when you say when I was a child it covers a very long stage of development and then he positions them to say when I was a child I thought and uh uh spoke and understood as a child and then he says when I became a man and he puts them against each other that there's when you're a child and though it may cover this long period of time he says when I became a man I put away these things that would reflect being an infant a little child a minor not of age or being untaught or unskilled not that there wouldn't be more to learn and more to uh implement but he's looking at this time when things that related to that particular age had now found their place and he was coming into adulthood the use of a word man in the Greek it's used to distinguish an adult from a child one that has grown up or one that has matured so he's wanting to think of childish things things that are related to babes or uh a youth a minor and one that is grown up or a man an adult in John chapter 9 if you were to read the story uh you could start with verse one and then read almost all the way to verse 34 I believe and it tells the story of a blind man who is the Bible says was blind from birth and I I wanted to share this question when they passed by this man who was blind from birth help me understand what the disciples were think thinking it says they said master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and I I I just haven't been able to figure it out for years why they asked that question they said he was born blind did this man sin that he was born blind that would they must have thought a lot about a baby in the womb like the things he could imagine and the Mischief he could get into and sin before he's even born and God would blind him for it but anyways this man was blind from birth and and the story is that Jesus told him to go wash in the pul Shalom and he was washed and he received his sight and the Pharisees didn't like this for a number of reasons and they went to the parents and they asked the parents you know what happened and what's the story here and the Jews had said that anybody who would speak positively of the Messiah I think it's in verse 22 they feared the Jews because the Jews had agreed that if any man confessed that Jesus was the Christ he would have been put out of the church or out of the synagogue so there was this peer pressure and this political pressure to not say anything about Jesus and in verse 21 uh they ask by what means he now seeth they asked him by what means does he now see and this is their response but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself this is uh though we know and the Bible goes to another scripture to give us in verse 22 the context as to why they said it they might have known that it was Jesus and they knew it was the Messiah and they may have wanted to confess it but their answer is right but it hides behind that pressure to not give Christ the credit but he says he is of age he shall speak for himself in other words he's an adult we don't have to answer we do not have to explain to you uh what our convictions are tell you what happen since he is of age he has the right to speak for himself he is mature enough go ask Kim and in under the law there was a when a when a child came of a particular age and they would say it's when they could uh give proof of of uh development physical development in pub at around 12 years old that they would be qualified to be a witness in certain proceedings if someone needed to testify or give witness and so one could be of age even as an adolescent or a teenager but then uh one would pass these other Junctions to where as they grew or they matured and they developed uh they would be growing each time but here it means he is of age he's mature enough he can speak for himself the word of age is stature so he's of a particular stature of adult age he's maturity he's matured it speaks of maturity and it means to attain a state fit for a thing in other words he is of age he's like he's obtained a state to where he can speak for himself he doesn't need his parents uh man managing his Affairs he doesn't need his parents uh uh taking care of business could you imagine for some of you adults here if you weren't able to make it into work and you had your mom call and tell your boss sorry but brother Andrew is not able to make it into work today he's not feeling well and he'd be like is he in a coma is he having surgery why is his mom calling it's like no that's my son I'm just looking out after him and taking care of him this is the idea that there's this age of responsibility where he can speak for himself I use this very quickly just so that we can all be on the same page of what it is that we're referring to I will say this that tonight I had I'm not going to have the time maybe to get into how this relates to those three things of the individual uh the home and the church but there's this parallel to the house of the Lord and the purpose of worship and the Tabernacle of witness so I I don't want you to think that we're just trying to shoehorn this into this uh series and not and being stubborn about our titling but I want to use this principle the age of criminal responsibility and we hear maybe quite often that they're uh a CH someone who is below the age of 18 has committed a heinous act or some crime and there's a decision to try them as an adult and so there are things that brother B talks about juvenile delinquency and we hear that word quite a bit and to be juvenile it's over relating to young people and uh so when we have youth camps you can call them juvenile camps and I'm going to a juvenile camp so what are you in for uh there's um it's characteristic or suitable for young a young person for youngans for youths however you would say it that there are uh things that are juvenile they're characteristic of someone who is a child whether it be a minor or whether it be someone who's not of age or someone who's unskilled a little child something that is juvenile it relates to a particular time of life and the definition is the state of one who is not emotionally mature and therefore the law has different standards depending on whether or not you're categorized as an adult one who can have the Mena the intent form the intent the mental process to know what you're doing and what the consequences of what you're doing and so they'll take a someone that is a juvenile and not a certain age and they'll measure whether or not they believe they had this malice of forethought or they knew what they were doing and they were they're old enough to be held accountable as an adult so we're familiar with that idea of the age of criminal responsibility where juvenile though they're only 14 because of their act and because of their the way that they went about it they want to try them as an adult and say Well they're mature enough to face the consequences but I want you to think of how even the law itself recognizes this pattern of development and says that there's a particular time at which we don't necessarily trust them to vote we don't necessarily trust them to drive cars we wouldn't have them go to war we wouldn't allow them to buy alcohol there's certain things that we watch out over of a certain age because they're not mature enough and developed enough emotionally and mentally to be able to handle or trust their decisions in those things they are a juvenile they are a child they are young and they have not matured enough to a certain point to where they can be trusted so it's about responsibility Paul is talking about this very thing when he says when I was a child when I was juvenile when I was of a particular age of a particular development when I thought a certain way and acted a certain way uh uh these things that are characteristics of being a young person he say but when I became a man I put away childish things and Paul may have purely been talking about his own personal development as an individual and how that he had certain propensities as a teenager but then as he was taught and he learned and he grew there was things he no longer did just by way of maturing emotionally and spiritually and that when he became a man his life was markedly different than it was when he was a teenager in his early 20s and he's using that as an example of what happened happens when that which is perfect is come so Paul may have been very specific about the fact that this was him as an individual and as a man living a natural life but there's a spiritual parallel to the development of the spiritual body of Christ and the spiritual maturity of the believer that relates to what ought to happen when that which is perfect is come amen now in the qu question and answers part two and I believe every statement I want to read tonight uh just about every statement I think I have a couple other statements from somewhere else but these are lengthy I've provided them in a slide I want to go through them with you so that it's kind of in the fabric of of this subject and it's in your hearts and in your minds and in your Consciousness and then if we're not able to read them again or go back to them we could just kind of create this aura that it's all there when other people come who aren't here tonight and they're in the service it's there because it's in our hearts and in our minds brother Brams asked a question I'm going to read one 2 3 4 four questions all of them basically relate to this very scripture in some way brother Brandon brings it back to this scripture First Corinth in 1 Corinthians 13 dear brother brandom I have been baptized in Jesus name the word says that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost does this mean I should receive a definite experience with the baptism I'm anxious to be filled with the spirit now brother bam said there's a good question and I believe it is this is a good question and brother brandham is going to tonight I want you to recognize there's things that brother brandham must establish as right and unassailable but he's going to acknowledge at the same time these traps that people have gotten into with those things to where it hasn't quite LED them in the way that it ought to have some something's in the misunderstanding somewhere and so he's wanting to get he's wanting to answer the question that's asked not the one that we think is being asked brother Brams asked questions and people say well do all born of again Believers go in the Rapture and then brother bam says no and so we just build a whole uh all sorts of manner of Doctrine around it not realizing that that question wasn't yours it was somebody else's and whatever that person was thinking when the question was asked brother bradam has to answer that or he gives them the wrong answer and we need to be mature enough with the word of God to know what brother bradam taught about being born again and realized that what brother random was doing was addressing those who in their minds thought you could actually be born again without the spirit so he had to move the needle for them to realize okay you're born again confessing but you have to go on to receive what is the actual New Birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and here I believe this question is asked with maybe a lot of assumptions a lot of things in mind and brother Brandon picks up on it immediately because we would say well this person wants a definite experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother Braham says the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience that a person must have I love it that he says this because this is a must you must be born again it is a definite experience too it's not anything you should be like well I don't know I mean back at that juvenile Camp there at one year I got I think I was born again I you know things have been a little bit different since then and uh it's not because you were traumatized because the food or the smells but you just think well something happened to my there should be a definite experience then he immediately says now let me kind of clear that up just for a minute now many people have the idea I believe it's twisted and he's not quite finishing his thought but he's thrown a lot out there and maybe they're here maybe right here to the church and to the church that's listening there might be a question now when I speak of not believing the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking with tongues I do not accept that I believe with God's help I can prove it in the Bible that that's wrong because the speaking in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost how many knows that so it's saying it is a gift of the Holy Ghost divine healing is a gift of the Holy Ghost and here the Beatles are doing it Satan can impersonate any of those gifts witches Wizards can speak in tongues and interpret it the jungle lands many times a wizard will speak in tongues drink blood out of a human skull and interpret unknown tongues now I I I'm I'm skipping some a portion here but I want you to recog brother bram's teeing up immediately when some this person says I want to receive a definite experience of the baptism the Holy Ghost so brother Bram says yes there is a definite experience but let me clear something up about what you what this definite experience might be because you might be thinking if I could just manifest myself in some sort of emotional way that I've had that definite experience so I'm skipping quite a few uh paragraphs here I trust that you could go back yourselves and listen or read it he says many questions here on it well will the bride will this the church and he says you can't divide what they are the bride is the elected of God so there's there's those things that can manifest and can present and look a certain way and he said we got to make the mistake of just assigning categories to things that happen says you can't divide it he says the bride is elected the church goes through we know the church goes through tribulation it'll stand before white Throne judgment but the bride elected of God are the only ones that can be born again therefore they're the only ones that can go in a Rapture that's the ones it says whosoever will let him come the church but the bride is the elected of God there's five offices elected of God for God has said in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists God did that this is a very important scripture in Ephesians 4 it's at the real heart of the things I've been studying on this man has deacons and so forth and everything else but you see but God set in the church for the perfecting of the church so there's things in the church that are ordained of God for what purpose the perfecting he says you can't divide it and this is where he he's kind of entering back into answering this question directly now the Holy Spirit when it comes it is a witness unto you that this word is right the word for today not the word of Luther not the word not for Moses we witness it's the truth but it's another day so we witness the truth of the restoration of the gifts we witness the truth of the uh of justification and sanctification we witness the truth of Moses and Noah but you must also recognize the building of the truth to the age that we live in now now what if Jesus would come and say now as Moses came talking to you all out taking you out of Egypt I come taking you somewhere else what if he said let's go work and build an ark I'm the Lord God I'm going to float the world away now I'm going to drown the world all of them why he'd been out of the scripture he would have been out of the scripture never said he'd come like that he wouldn't have been the Messiah no matter how much Arc he'd built of whatever he had done he'd have not qualified the Messiah there you are it's qualification quite a statement is he's answering the question about a definite experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he wants to be very clear that he does he believes in speaking speaking in tongues he believes in Divine Healing but as far as trying to measure your experience by whether or not these things happen he's cautioning and he says the qualification is not in these this me these metrics are these things but what about the word for your day you wouldn't reject Moses you can't reject Noah you can't reject uh The Exodus and and the flood but he's saying Jesus couldn't come and try to bring them back he the scriptures spoke something of him and so what he had to do is Manifest the word for his hour and that was the qualification and then he immediately says 1 Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away brother brandom I've been baptized in Jesus name the word says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost does this mean I should receive a definite experience with the baptism I'm anxious to be filled with the spirit and brother brandom leads him right to 1 Corinthians 13 when that which is perfect has come that which is part shall be done away qualification so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talking tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect it's not denying jumping up and down it's not denying talking with tongues it's not denying all these other things but he's saying but when that which is perfect is come and he says and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things brother Rand was putting right at the heart of his message 1 Corinthians 13 8-12 or 8-13 even and he is orienting us to things that have been and things that will be and at this point saying we do have today that which is perfect by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication and he leads us to becoming a man when I was a child I thought as a child I spake as a child I understood as a child so all these little things of of Youth all these little things of enthusiasm and experience and those things he doesn't say they're of the devil he doesn't say they're wrong he doesn't say they don't belong but he's saying what would all those things be characteris ISC of we could say that not as an Evidence but it's it's it's life it's maybe some stimulation it's some sort of expression in manifestation of the spirit that would work upon an individual but he's saying that's not where it's at it's the qualification of the word for your day in the time that you're living in when that which is perfect has come we come to manhood we come to adulthood and then he's asked this question that was question 281 then question 289 so we know it's several questions later he says at the instance of re excuse me at the instant of receiving the holy ghost or the baptism of the Holy Ghost is there a difference does a person speak with tongues if not always what manifestation is known they're asking good questions and I cleaned up the question a little bit as it as it was asked you'll find that brother brandham is repeat some of the statements in there I tried to clean it up to just what I thought the question actually was I apologize if if uh that would offend anyone but I just wanted to get get it across uh for the sake of this sermon at the moment that a person receives the Holy Ghost is there a difference that maybe could say he's already been asked a def is there a definite experience so definite difference there's some sort of Distinction that's wanting to be brought out of I know this is the moment that I got it he said does a person speak with tongues if not if they don't always speak with tongues what manifestation declares whether or not a person's been born again he says well could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it this is in other words how could you claim then to have experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost and have never known it that's quite a question it's a a very interesting statement I think I was ministering on a definite experience of the new birth overseas one time and um the brothers that we were ministering it to the ministers there uh a couple of them kind of took great offense to it because they had been told uh by some other preachers that you could have a definite experience and not know it and the question they posed to me was do you know when you were born do you remember being born I says you only know when you're born because your passport tells you when you were born and and and and I said well where didd you get that it was always brother so and so brother and so and so and never brother brandham the question brother brandham asked is can a mother give birth and not know it well well today they can when science intervenes right but according to the way that God had ordained it and sorrow as she would bring forth a child the Bible says she cannot forget that child she'd have to be unconscious not to know it neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it there's something that takes place in you there's something that changes you your whole system your whole spiritual system is made new again and you become a new creature in Christ as the Bible puts it a new creation in Christ you know it now you say brother brandom then you don't believe that a man could should speak in tongues to receive the Holy Ghost not to prove he's got the Holy Ghost so this is second time in this question and answers these things are starting to come up he says I would that every member of my church spoke with tongues so is it a dirty thing no is it an unscriptural thing no as long as you don't make it one and I would like for them to do that and and I believe if you ask God God will grant it to you so there's this uh there's this putting the gifts uh in context to say I mean it's there God can move upon you this gift can take place and it can transpire and I would that everyone in my church did it and I'd like for them to and I believe if you ask God that you will but let me tell you here's the prophet now cautioning his own church saying Hey I want you to do it you enjoy that just like we might sometimes as parents make available to our children certain things they can enjoy oh that's fine son you enjoy that honey you go ahead and enjoy that H have fun uh uh buy that experience this go here do that but realize this son that's not everything or that's not the ultimate that's not what's most important don't get caught up in those things don't don't make that your emphasis don't make that your drive and your passion but let me tell you I know plenty of people that speak in tongues and hasn't got the Holy Ghost and there's not a minister that's true with himself and with his congregation but will tell his congregation the same right anybody who won't emphasize the same being dishonest right he's not being true with himself or his church the devil can impersonate that Paul said though I speak with tongue of men and angels though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice though I understand all Mysteries of the word though I give all my goods to the poor and all these things and have not charity I'm still nothing wow I have faith that I can move mountains and so forth I'm still nothing then he said that which is in part will be done away with when that which is perfect is come or when that which is perfect is made known hasn't he already kind of addressed this just eight questions prior question 281 he brought this question of the definite experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said now there is a definite experience but don't get caught up in all these other things just look for the qualification of the word of God because we do have today the perfect interpretation of the word by Divine Vindication through God's help amen and that's the Fulfillment of First Corinthians 13 that which is perfect is come and that's when the childish things are put away or done away with given context however you want to look at it and he comes right back to it when that which is perfect is come or when that which is perfect is made known and he says now I got a question on that I hope to get to it tonight about what happened when the seals opened so now he's telling us I want to get to a question specifically on this and how that when which is perfect is come or when that which is perfect is made known it relates to when the seals are opened are we all together in this all right good now think about this as he's asked this question question 302 please explain 1 Corinthians 138 to2 now that the perfect word is restored to the church are these verses fulfilled I I I read that as it's almost as if brother Brandon put the question in there like I want to get to to this so uh you asked this question I I'm not questioning whether or not these are organic questions it's perfect though he said I got a question tonight about what happened when the seals were open I believe this is the question now that the perfect word is restored to the church are these verses fulfilled he goes now I think I just went through that didn't I this is his answer and when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with Paul said though I speak with tongues of men and angels and do all these things here but when that which is perfect come now is there anything more per is there anything perfect but God no sir is God the perfect in the beginning was the and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word still God when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away with that's saying a lot this is something that has been made known now I know that we try to look at things and we look in ter linearly and chronologically and spatially so we think when that which is perfect has come we got to think about a particular time and distance has to be traveled and and if I'm going to come to your home we set a time for me to come otherwise it'd be pointless brother Aaron would you come over for dinner and and you don't tell me a time you don't tell me where and and I just tell you say oh I came over for dinner yesterday how I just thought through it you I had dinner in your house uh and you say well that I I I can't get my head around that but that's just the way that we think so we think when that which is perfect is come we got to pinpoint a exact moment in time and God has to travel some sort of distance but it's when that which is perfect is made known where the spirit of Lord there is Liberty that means there is a something an entrance is opened up to where now God is moving with the intent and deliberation to bring to Perfection it's not in some other age of development not in some other time but now in the order of the church it's come to a particular age a time for fulfillment a time to bring a people to a place where they're suitable for a particular purpose to attain to a state that is fit for a thing and he's saying that it's the word that's God it's god making himself known that which is perfect is come the perfect word is restored to the church so he says I think we covered that already and here it is question 318 same question and answers all of these are in the evening on August 23rd what is the is that a person is really filled with the Holy Ghost John 14:26 brother BR says quotes the scripture when the Holy Ghost has come he will show you things to come can we just look at this for a little bit brother Bram has asked what how can we tell the evidence that when someone is really filled with the Holy Ghost and he quotes John 14:26 when the Holy Ghost has come he'll show you things to come now now he's pointing out uh a principle that Jesus is teaching especially in this particular uh series of chapters in The Book of John of the the Holy Ghost the comforter he's a teacher he's going to show you things to come and I think this is the answer he will perfect it he'll perfect what the experience what is the evidence that a person is really filled with the Holy Ghost the the evidence that a person is filled the Holy Ghost is he will perfect it think of this really pray and ask yourselves examine yourselves by this he will perfect it manads won't do it this that's just a that's just a quick punch but it packs a lot of weight he'll perfect it manads won't do it and he is the word which God was this is going back to answer 302 this is going back to answer for 289 the answer 281 he will perfect it he is the word when the Holy Ghost has come he will identify himself in you with the scripture so taking these things together about qualification if Jesus came preaching Moses's gospel he wouldn't have been the Messiah if Jesus came preaching Noah's gospel he wouldn't have been the Messiah what he preached what he emphasized what he demonstrated was the qualification that he was the Messiah what about the bride she will do this she will do that brother bam says I've got this written out here I've got these questions about she'll do this and she'll do that but when that which is perfect has come she's under an elect Ministry to bring her to what Perfection he will perfect it manads won't do it the Holy Ghost will identify himself in you according to the word and that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word now look what if you spoke with tongues I just want to ask you that now he's asking the question questions Jesus said when the Holy Ghost come what would he do and what if you spoke with tongues jumped up and down shouted and everything else and then come the word you notice where where he's bringing this there is all sorts of things that one can do and uh uh this is just life if you look at in the pattern when I was a child what let me say it this way Paul says when I was a child I thought as a child I spake as a child I understood as a child is that evidence that he can never be a man when you were 8 years old you did this and you did that you can never be a man you'll never grow up well I mean it it's there's not it's not a sentence or a condemnation it's not judgment they saying so you spoke with tongues you jumped it down shouted and everything we said now here's the real test where where do things stand then the word comes you come to a place where the word begins to open up or things are uh being identified in your life life and things are you're being challenged with certain things then the word comes I'm saying it what's your response and I prove to you by the scriptures I have that the baptism using the title of Father Son and Holy Ghost is absolutely a misunderstanding of the scripture nobody was ever baptized like that and you go ahead and hang with it anyhow could you tell me the Holy Spirit and you would do a thing like that how can it deny its own word now what is he referring to the evidence of the Holy Ghost now I'm not I'm not saying that we should just P pin it down to if I asked any one of you well in Revelations 13 it says this what is that you're like true true or false this or that and you get it wrong it's like well I must not have the Holy Ghost because I I couldn't get the trivia question answered just right in the time allotted to me it's not it's not a game of Jeopardy there is it is the it's as the word would be presented I I want you to I want you to really think about it not just make these knee-jerk reject you know things like oh well you know if it's not that quick then you don't have the Holy Ghost but and I and I'm not trying to water down what he's saying but the point is could the Holy Spirit deny the word no it cannot so when it it is there is there something in you now this is brother Aaron saying this is there something in you that when the word can get past the mind and all your senses and everything in between is there something in you that can ultimately resonate and say Amen to the word of God can the holy spirit in you say yes to that once it's fought through all unbelief and all darkness and everything that clouds the channels and everything's that in way do you have it in you at the end of the day to humble yourself to the word of God and say I know that's the truth I've wrestled with it I fought it I didn't believe it I struggled with it for years I was taught wrong I misunderstood but here now as the word is opening up to it something in my heart says Amen to that I believe that and he says when I show you what's supposed to take place in this day how that the son of man is to reveal himself what he's to do and all these scripture that's been now and then see him come right down and identify and you hang right on to a denomination and say that you're born again could you make sense out of that this is Brother brandham provoking thought about what about the evidence when someone is really filled the Holy Ghost he says a lot of things you could do but when it comes to that word where do you stand for yourself now trust me he's not given us a metric by which we can all kind of sit down and with the help of AI come up with a rubric so that we can judge people could and we'll just go to a we'll go to a a restaurant and we'll just pull people as they walk in just excuse me do you have a moment I want to ask you a few questions do you determine whether or not you got the Holy Ghost are we good okay there and we're going to ask the questions and we're going to follow the chart and once they've said no or yes or whatever else we thank you and they're like well what what how did I do do I have the Holy Ghost oh no you clearly don't have the Holy Ghost because we were able to kind of ask the questions gave you the word test and you denied it now this is for you this is for you to think about this is for you to challenge yourself for you to be honest with yourself brother M's calling out the intellectual honesty of preachers who will say one thing and not be honest about the fact that the word says another and he says could you make sense out of that and you hang with it anyhow he says could I tell my wife I love her and have a date with another woman and run around and then tell her from my heart I love her you think that'd be true love could she tell me she loves me and while I'm gone gone away she run around with some other man like that's that escalated quickly I thought we were just talking about water baptism and now you you're talking about adultery same thing right that spiritual adultery is related to physical adultery people can rant and rail they want against homosexuality but they have spiritual homosexual lesbian spirits that govern their churches that's all it is and they'll be blew in the face yelling and screaming about sexual sin and they they are the ones propagating it and he says that's exactly what Israel done he said you've set your limbs apart and taken every man that come by and you played the part of the whoredom with me and I'll put you away in divorce exactly what is that you're committing adultery against your own body and when a woman goes out and lives with another man or a man with another woman when they're married to them they're defiling their own flesh and when a person says that he's a Christian will absolutely deny the scripture being right he's committing adultery against the body that he claims to be in so it's a mark of antichrist so much that it would deceive the elected if possible when the Holy Ghost will come the true evidence that one has been filled with the Holy Ghost now not a baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your body not an anointing that can fall but when one is really filled by an experience of the Holy Ghost is sealed in the soul he's saying what is that evidence he says he will perfect it not manads but the Holy Ghost will come and identify himself in you with the scripture so there it we would desire to not have any misunderstanding the scripture we would desire to know what this revelation of the son of man is we do not want to be unfaithful to the word which we are a part of which brother bradam is saying to deny the word or to fail to fulfill the word or to reject the word would be just as guilty as committing adultery and the natural uh and type we cannot deny the scripture because we would be committing adultery against the body that we're a part of and he calls out this Mark of the Antichrist that's so close it could deceive the ctive possible so there is a qualification there is an identification there is a Vindication and a manifestation of whether or not one has truly been sealed by the Holy Ghost and it has something to do with putting away childish things and becoming a man 1 Corinthians chapter 13: 10-13 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things the Bible refers to be speaking like a man and speak to one as a man so much that comes to my mind when I begin to think about these things and I as I have just felt so burdened uh in these things for quite some time and studied on it so there's a lot of scriptural images we've studied and things we've considered and there's a way that you talk to uh an infant there's a way you'll talk to a toddler and it's not the same way that you would talk to an adult and I could just imagine if we were in a a deacon meting and I was like brother Mike honey if you could just be sure to do this and just talk to him in he might be like you're kind of weirded me out brother Aaron right like that's no way to talk to a man right you g yourself like a man speak like a man speak face to face and there's a way that you talk and maybe we've seen it at times when maybe an adult will talk to their child in such a way to where it's like that's kind of baby talk for that age right it's like how that how are they ever going to talk like an adult when the adults always talk to them like yeah you going to high school today huh first day Senor you're a Senor now huh look at you big senior right like like let's talk talk like a grownup to somebody who's a of age of a particular age and so he says when I became a man I put away childish things for now notice this for now I hope I read all of that but for now we see through a glass Darkly it it's not perfectly clear but then face to face now I know in part but then for now but then for now but then but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity that's the Capstone that's the Finish finishing that's the perfecting of the stature that's the final work that's the piece that completes it that is that which is perfect is come now Darkly now as in a mirror that isn't quite clear I'm not sure I can't see it I'm not it's not level it's not where I fully can comprehend what I'm looking at but face to face I want you to think of it this way when you're face to face your eye to eye what does it speak of the same stature there's a time as children you look up and it's not eye to eye there's a time when it is disproportionate in the sense that as as as a child or as the younger you serve the Elder and you give the respect and you never grow up enough to show disrespect but there is a scriptural principle that as the child grows and ages there's a point at which he is accepted he is accepted and it's eye to eye it is it is a peer relationship says now I see through glass Darkly now there it's disproportionate in my understanding and what my experience and what I've been taught and what I know but then it will be face to face it'll be I to eye I have grown to where we can see eye to eye we can we can think alike and we can see alike and I've matured enough because then he says I shall know as I am known in other words I have matured you you know me you know things about me parents know things about their children they know the way that they're going they know what's coming so they teach them they train them and there's a point at which that child comes to a place where the adults need to stop using a language to suggest that they ain't done nothing they ain't been nowhere I get those people whenever you have a kid because they have two oh just wait till you have two right they're just always ahead of you all right so yeah you could be pastoring a church for 30 years and you could be 66 years old and the pastor who's 96 just wait till your 96 little young pup right but when he was 66 he was the E eth messenger right he was he could do everything and so there's this always idea this idea of well no one's ever going to be good enough and no one can ever achieve and Paul is recognizing no the servant will become like his master they shall see eye to eye face to face then I will know is even also I am known and I'd like to say this in in direct uh commentary on what brother bam is saying in question and answers that what God did in changing the age where brother Brown's talk about qualification and he's talking about um Luther's age and Wesley's age and the age of the uh outpouring of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts and brother brandom orienting us to the qualification the word for today the scriptural principles for today what God did in changing the age he demonstrates what his purpose is for the new birth if God only wanted the church to I I I think I need to be careful how I say this cuz I don't want to misrepresent this at all we understand that God has a purpose and it's not just the purpose of birthing it it wasn't just the purpose oh they're here throw them on the Shelf let's go get another one right and it it's it's not not taking inventory but and just stacking rocks but brother M talks about end time evangelism being the shaping of the stone to fit and so this the purpose of the new birth is reflected in how that God transition in all ages from the feet all the way up to the head and how God's transitioned all the way up to the intelligence there is this growth in stature as it matures and comes out in Perfection and it's manifesting the change of justification to sanctification to Restoration of the gifts to the Perfection demonstrates what God's purpose is in the new birth which is formed in those three stages that through the new birth we're to come to a place of maturity and Perfection and brother in the sermon marriage and divorce I want to just I want to try to wrap this up as soon as possible this evening but then face to face but then shall I know when that which is perfect has come brother Bram says when the seals are opened is that not what the question was when the perfect word is restored what happened when the seals were open when the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word that explains why all the mistakes have been made Through the Ages because the seals were not open this was not revealed now we could debate all we want on well they didn't need the seals and the first church didn't have the seals and the seals revealed what's been left off and we could try to get bogged down and semantics but we have to realize that whatever the reasons were and whatever we could diagnose about what's been we know at least for now mistakes were made because things were hid mistakes were made because things had been chained up mistakes were made because things had been mistaught but then God has a time and an hour where he's going to set the record straight he's going to tie up Loose Ends he's going to reveal the perfect word and the perfect word is what we need for our age we can even say that perfect faith is a faith that is necessary for the moment you're in you say I need perfect faith if it's if whatever the your situation you're in whatever it is you're facing whatever it is you're going through the perfect faith for that moment would be the faith you need to overcome to withstand to to to receive what you have need of and we're living in a time where there's got to be some scriptures fulfilled there's a promise for this age and we need a perfect Faith to meet the mark of this age and therefore the word had to be opened up and he said this is the reason why we didn't have we had these mistakes because this wasn't revealed why is it we make mistakes as we grow up because we didn't know and what do some of why do what do even even parental love and parental care will allow children to make mistakes so they can learn now I'm not talking about life altering traumatizing mistakes well you wanted to jump off that cliff without a parachute uh no but just uh um allowing them to experience and to make decisions and it helped them to learn and there's they make mistakes because they didn't know and sometimes they make mistakes because when we taught we didn't teach it clearly we make a lot of assumptions about what they should know I can't tell you how many times I say on a daily basis could you get that and put it there and I know exactly what that is and I know exactly what there is and the the child is sitting there going what is that and where is there I'm like don't use that in a sentence and there's a there's a some sort of meeting to minds and it's like that that put it there like what's that where's there right and if you have the wrong kind of demeanor they're just grabbing anything and putting it everywhere because they don't want to get it wrong and so there has to be some a pause to say oh I'm sorry please take that stack of $100 bill and put it next to my dresser right we have them just everywhere and so there's there's this you very specific very specific instructions and so we know that we as parents can do better in how we articulate and we learn and we grow and we understand and by the time we raise our fourth one we just get it perfect but the seals are open brother BR said the third pull is the opening of The Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word now you may take exception to this you may not believe this you may not think that this pertains to brother brandom you may think brother bram's a false prophet you may think these things are going to happen that's all fine that's all well and good but at least you know what he said I stand by this is what brother random taught brother ROM taught that the seals are open in his ministry and the third pull is the opening of those seals the spirit of Truth directing us to the word not in part he so the whole thing's revealed so we know what's going to happen on day 362 of the Millennium no no that's not it the word that was promised to us the time and the season that we're living in and in John chap 16: 12-13 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now what a statement remember what Paul said to the Hebrew church I got a lot of things I want to say but I'm not sure you can handle it he says you can't bear them now you're at a season you're at a time you're in a particular place in your experience right now to where the things that I might say might not be fruitful for you how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that he shall speak that shall he speak and he will show you things to come it's the exact language brother manam was talking about he will perfect it under the opening of the word the spirit of Truth directs us to the word we have the spirit of Truth direct us to to the word there's things that the spirit of Truth is wanting to do guide us that's to instruct us it's to teach us into all truth show you things to come remember brother brandom had the vision of the third pool had different parts to it the most notable would be the one that we call the ENT Vision but it's had different parts and what brother man's trying to lace up that booty and what did the spirit say to when he made a mess of it you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things you'll create carnal impersonations they will you'll cause carnal impersonations you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things it's quite a statement but it has to do with the third pool there are Supernatural things that the spirit of Truth is to direct us too but it can only be learned as you grow can only be learned as you're willing to grow he says how can I teach you algebra when you can't understand your ABCs that's why you can't teach Supernatural things to Pentecostal uh babies is because there's not they're not apprehending they're not growing they're not Desiring they're not willing to sit and listen and to learn so Paul saying brother brandom I believe bringing it into our view and I know I've just thrown a lot there as hopefully just maybe I've focused in quite a bit to see a lot of granular things but this adulthood becoming a man is marked by becoming not aging we can't say well I've been I've been preaching this message for 46 years I've been a Believer for 50 years and say that that's some sort of Mark of maturity it's becoming not aging and the becoming has to do in some ways with putting away childish things in John 14:26 but when the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I had said unto you this is what brother bam said is the real evidence when one is filled the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost has come he'll show you things come he will perfect it man-made won't do it I thought I had this in there I don't think I do I have a a statement from the church age book in there in the next slide I thought it was in the notes I just noticed that I must have uh printed the wrong copy or saved the wrong copy but brother bam says I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word so how could we have the Holy Ghost and deny any part of the word how could we act like balam or run in the air the way of Cain or or or being the gains of cor to accept partial truth and reject the rest of it Jesus did not emphasize works over the word he did not say that the evidence of the Holy GH ghost would be speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing it would be that you would be in the truth that's what the scripture stands for that when the Holy Spirit comes he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance the evidence of the Holy Ghost may not be able to be discerned outwardly but you should be able to know inwardly that the holy spirit is teaching you all things and bringing all things to your remembrance the inside teachers teaching me all things and then reminding me when I need to know it teaching me all things reminding me of what he taught me teaching me all things bringing all things to my remembrance that's the real gift of the Holy Ghost it's the process of hearing recognizing obeying this process of disciplining ourselves making application the world the world has it in their disciplines and the biohacking and all the things that people do and and they come up with all sorts of ways to try to maximize their health and their thought process and their thinking and they streamline all sorts of process is where they'll never take a hot shower only cold ones they eat avocado ice cream or whatever it is they do they just are so obsessed with being the best person that they are that they discipline themselves according to what they've taught and what they've been learned that's going to make them the best athlete or the best whatever right and it's amazing the propensity that we can have in the natural things and discipline ourselves so carefully to Natural things but not do anything when it comes to spiritual things that we know if we're going to be honest are the truth Ecclesiastes 10:16 to1 17 woe to the o land I said D woe to thee o land when thy King is a child and thy princes eat in the morning it's not taking a a diss on a k a king that's 8 years old or 12 years old if they were you might expect a lack of sensitivity a lack of discernment some wisdom in certain matters and it would be according to those that He surrounds themselves by that would determine the type of decision that's being made but says wo to thee when th King is a child a boy a lad what's amazing is it also means servant there's a time at which when a child as a child is no different than a servant but once he is face to face once he's eye to eye once he's grown and he can see eye to eye in the stature of the father he's no more a servant but he becomes a possessor of what he's air to woe to thee when thy King is a child he's a youth the word means a boy a servant a youth childish when he has the characteristics and qualities of a child when he's emotionally immature and this is exactly what Paul is referring to he says when a when I was a child I thought as a child I acted as a child wello to thee when your king is a child and thy princes eat in the morning this is quite a thought and so it's clarified in the next statement verse 17 blessed are thou o land when thy King is the the son of Nobles and thy Prince has eaten due season for strength and not for drunkenness it's the prioritizing of things go back listen to part one of this series one thing desired it's a maturing it's a learning of what what's valued what's important if that means I have to forego all sorts of things in my life to make myself the best human I can be in order that I might grow emotionally and spiritually that's what we do as we prioritize the right things when your king is a child when he acts like a child he thinks like a child he reacts as a child he lives like a child he's got no accountability whatsoever no rebellious and stubborn that's the scriptures I've been studying on this the sin of rebellion the sin of uh uh uh stubbornness that would only be a child who's not willing to learn not willing to grow not willing to be instructed and I believe that the word as deep as it is and as wonderful it is is and as much as it's opened up to us it's calling us to a place of spiritual maturity and emotional maturity and I would say number one to us men that we're no longer children but we're men and it's also so to our wives and to our children but let us take the responsibility as men that we do not want to be as children we do not want to be eating for drunkenness eating for pleasure but that we do it for strength and that we're just dispensing judgment first and righteousness first in putting the right things first so that all things can be done decently and in order because there is a consequence when the youngans don't grow up may the Lord bless you this evening as we stand to our feet musicians come
