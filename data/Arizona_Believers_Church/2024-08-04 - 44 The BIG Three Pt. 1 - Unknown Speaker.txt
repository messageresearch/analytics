TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I pray that the Lord would just be merciful to you all today and uh be gracious to you as the word is ministered that it would it would Minister to you and whatever your needs might be and wherever you find yourself in life that you could make it relevant my title today and I realized yesterday as I was studying that this would probably be a part one uh it's the big three and I am uh I'll say this at the outset that uh if you could just give the word your full attention and in doing so I believe that though there's a lot of elements to this that are kind of exciting or things that uh from a theological standpoint could kind of get uh maybe gets my theological motor running uh at the core of it it's very practical and very relevant and I would even say that um it's applicable for your heart for your home for our church in ways that are very personal and very serious as we were looking at the last several services on Liberty there was this theme where there's some attention given to the Optics of church and the Optics of how uh Believers Express themselves uh maybe in their worship and ways that brother Brandon was uh looking at certain things in ways that the scripture emphasizes certain things and in doing all that we could think well that was just kind of putting a Mark or a stamp on um how church services should be conducted but there was uh at the really part of that this principle that we could see in the word of God that we can apply to everyday life and I'm praying that God will deal deeply and personally uh with us as a church uh us as individuals all of us and I believe that he is in these things and I'm studying these things I'm just feeling more and more inspired to really do battle not by trying to chase after the devil but by getting into the word of God and finding out its secrets and the power that's available to us as Believers because I believe the Lord is really addressing real battles you might think even some of the things that we've preached as of late like oh well that's kind of a that's a nice take or that was put together well it's addressing real battles real things and so I believe God wants to do that now in 2 Corinthians Chap 11:3 and I believe it won't take long before you realize what I mean by the big three in 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I fear by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ it was this scripture that was at the very heart of sermons that we begin to preach a few month months ago as it relates to the house of the Lord or our homes in particular and these these aspects of the serpent beguiling Eve through subtlety that focuses our attention to the garden and that our minds would be corrupted uh so that brings it forward to today like this present tense and it's this principle the Simplicity that is in Christ that Simplicity that is in Christ is so uh such a rich statement and such a rich phrase and there's a lot of things that you could draw from it of the singleness of Christ but it's also the abundance and the generosity of Christ and there's a lot of ways that we can look at it to where we can begin to measure whether or not we are in fact being corrupted from Simplicity in the way that we think and the way that we act and talk so as a serpent deceived the woman we recognize that Paul is bringing this uh application of what took place in the garden to the church as the serpent deceived the woman in doing so it caused the woman's Disobedience to God's word and we could see this principle that Satan did it by sowing seed he sews the seed in the mind and he SWS the seed of discrepancy and he says things that are contrary to the word of God in order that those seeds may take fruit in the spirit and then once it's kind of been received into the womb of the Mind it'll actually bring forth activity or action which will further that process of sewing seed so there's this metaphor I think that we referenced before how that Paul is saying as the serpent beguiled Eve and he seduced her from her duty to her husband so he's looking at that in the very readings here in 2 Corinthians how it has to do with the husband he was able to seduce her away from her Duty and away from her faithfulness and Fidelity to her husband Adam and that's that's the example that Paul is wanting us to consider when we would be corrupted we know that in Mark chapter 1 in Matthew chapter 4 Luke chapter 4 that Christ is Led of the spirit Into the Wilderness in Mark 1: 12 and 13 it says immediately the spirit driveth him into the Wilderness and he was there in the wilderness 40 days tempted of Satan and reading this it kind of struck me how that when we read of The Temptations in the other books uh it seems as if it's like Bam Bam Bam Bam just happens successively and I'm not saying that it didn't necessarily happen that way I'm not sure just exactly uh what time meant to Jesus in terms of days and what uh what this temptation exactly looked like in its Logistics but this scripture reading almost uh gives us the idea that over this 40-day period Satan was coming to him and tempting him and so it wasn't like he just woke up one morning and was really hungry and Satan just hit him with one two three it was it was a uh maybe something that took place over a period of time so Christ is tempted of Satan and he said the Bible says he was with wild beast and then we know in the end the Angels ministered unto him this temptation of Christ is very is uh an example of even what Satan did to the woman in the garden it's very interesting in a garden in a paradise where there was Perfection there was provision there was everything she would need Satan tempts the woman and then the woman who could have brought forth the word she falls through Satan's Temptation and here's Christ who is the word he is the he is the one that would come he is tempted not in a garden but in a Wilderness in a desert we know that he overcomes by the word and that those two tempations uh paralleled so today what we're looking at and we've made this statement before in some of our past sermons I think on the The Labyrinth and some of those sermons during that time Satan will attempt to lead the bride away from the revealed word there's a lot of things that we could get away from that are Traditions there's a lot of things that we could look down on that uh or maybe the uh the Optics of church and Christianity uh but Satan if he can get us distracted by all those things if we could get it in our minds that if we just do a certain thing uh that we've got the truth or that we have we have the Holy Ghost or if we just look a certain way that we're going to be okay he'll just let us be distracted but at the heart of it he wants to lead us away from the revealed word CU that is our mate that is our husband and he will seduce he'll try to seduce us from just simply believing God's word now I know that that may seem uh like maybe obvious I think it's brother Theo that's been saying duh a lot we were fellowshipping the other day and he was like duh and I was like that's right man it could be the new amen yeah Jesus Loves Me duh you know like get them sick them but uh let's not start that that was your opportunity um now uh it may seem to be kind of an odd proposition say well we get that but there's there's even these human instincts just as we saw it in the man and the woman when they fell and we see this Instinct in Cain and man has always sought some way to appease his conscience and to make himself Feelgood about certain things and so we have this instinct to try to do more than what we must do and what is necessary and the Bible teaches us and Jesus says very plainly only believe so we don't fear that's one thing we don't do but one thing we must do is believe and so I think there's a Scarlet Letter or a stigma that's tried to be placed that tries to be placed on faith in order for us to move away from Faith as the foundation and the premise and the basis and move into this other realm of proof and Vindication uh that we can do on our own to make us feel like I got it and it's very tricky the way that the devil will do it now if you'll turn in your Bibles to First John and you may already be there or still be there but for those who still bring the oldfashioned book and you flip in Pages 1 John Chapter 2 we'll start with verse 12 we'll end up reading uh to verse 18 a little bit later but at least to verse 17 here in the near term now let's try to walk through this together I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake as we read through this I want you to recognize how that he essentially addresses three classes of people he's going to address a child a youth an adult in each one of these languages that he uses and we could view these all of us whether you be you don't have to be a father and you don't have to be a young man you can either be a child you could be a a youth or you could be an adult and there is maybe more stricter constructs that they might use in the period of that time when they would use a word that oh that's person over 30 or that's someone that's under this age we're not necessarily using that but we're kind of looking at this non-binary spectrum where someone could just be a child some could be a youth and some are in adulthood and these we could say are stages of life and in these stages of life as uh John is walking through this I was noticing and I'm not I don't want to get too into this aspect but he calls out some specific virtue or character for that stage of life that ought to be ought to be something that you have I know you're thinking about this maybe for the first time so that's good or you're like duh say something say something we don't know and I don't like to say something you don't know because that would maybe put me in a really bad spot or you in a bad spot so he says I write into you little children that's a a stage of life because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake that is something something that every child should be taught should know should be uh uh have a clear head about and and be certain of or be uh at least be confessing and be familiar with the idea so that is something that we could say we should teach our children that children should know because John is writing to them because their sins are forgiven he says I write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning now this would be the adulthood a more mature stage of Life at a more advanced stage not necessarily in age but in responsibility and maturity I write unto your fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one so you could see that in each one of these there's something about the fathers who uh have known uh something a long time and from the beginning these young men young people or youth they've overcome the wicked one these are things uh that not only as a child should you know that you're sins are forgiven but as a youth you should should have come to this place of a new birth experience to have overcome sin and overcome the wicked one and then in in traveling this passage we could come to a place where as fathers you continue to remain in the as adults we continue to remain in that faith that began even as a little child to believe that my sins were forgiven so there there's a lot here uh maybe to unpack and I might be getting bogged down in it says verse 14 I written unto you fathers because you have known the himm that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one so he's addressed these three classes of people uh or three stages of Life a child who sins are forgiven a father who has known him who is from the beginning and to the young men he now has these three different characteristics to you young men you're strong the word of God abides in you and you overcome the wicked one and he's looking at this particular aspect that that's where that's where our real foundational experience with God has formed is in that youth in the certain time of life brother random even touches on it how that by 21 most people have made up their minds and that they're it's much harder after that uh to come to God and to yield your heart and the reason is because there's a part of the human brain that has fully matured and it's more susceptible to reason and doubt an analysis and it makes it harder for someone just to trust God whom they have not seen and can only know by faith verse 15 it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him now that's quite quite a statement to say that if you love the world then the love of the father is not in you now let me call to REM the title The Big Three we're looking at Satan's Temptations or some sort of ungodly pressures or desires and how that he attacks how he sews seed how he's working against uh you as a Believer as an individual you as a youth you as a child or you as an adult this is the way that he works in every aspect and there's something that we can rest in as a child that despite how Satan would work against us our sins are forgiven there's something that we can take comfort in as a youth that no matter how he works against us uh we have we are strong the word of God abides in us and we are filled with the Holy Ghost we've overcome the wicked one and there's something that we take in consolation as an adult is this God who's been with me who I knew his of his forgiveness as a child and his overcoming power as a youth here I stand in this season of Life believing and knowing that my God is with me and so it is there is this I wanting you to know that there's this aspect that uh John is identifying before we get into the big three I want you to recognize how that uh there's this beat buildup to it and I will say this I thought I was going to minister on money women and popularity not only this morning but months ago and this is just how long it takes for me to get there and I think Wednesday we'll get there so you don't want to miss Wednesday night when we preach on money women and popularity is that going to make it on our Instagram or IG put out a YouTube short for it so three classes of people three stages of life and in each one he kind of admonishes them or instructs them in some sort of virtue or character uh that they have or he kind of calls out something that is rooting that is grounding and then he is instructing all three groups because now I'm kind of for looking forward he's instructing all three groups about the world and in addressing each one the child the youth or the adult he's expressing to them this power of overcoming this uh uh this grace of God that is in their life and as he begins to um come into this section of his letter as of his writing he divides the world or we could say the wicked age or uh our present time or Satan's Eden maybe be a better way of saying he divides Satan's Eden the world that we presently live in as being under three different headings or heads and uh we could call them classifications or types or or kinds and so there's this concept and idea of three I think most often we think in threes as God is perfected in threes and three has a real strong connection to a lot of positive things in the New Jerusalem in Revelations CH 21:3 it's speaking of the gates of the city that are made of one Pearl says on the East three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates we know in the Book of Numbers I believe it's chapter 2 God arranges three tribes of the 12 tribes on each side of the Tabernacle in the wilderness that they all would have some sort of positioning there 3 333 all 12 facing uh the Tabernacle of God's presence the Tabernacle of witness this temple in the wilderness as you we could call it this house of God and there's three on each side and so we know that numberers 12 and that they're arranged with three on each side and as I've been looking at this and thinking about it recognizing that God arranges things for particular purpose and inspired by what John is writing here there in the city of the new jerusem no matter what side you're on you'd have to come through a gate there was three on this side three on this side three on that side there was three on each side so that no matter how if you wanted to enter if you want to enter into New Jerusalem you're coming through one of the three there's no other option and the fact that it was the just as the children of Israel were rounding uh the Tabernacle of witness in the house of the Lord there in the wilderness to me when we see this image in the New Jerusalem it's showing that all must approach through the same way all must be facing the same thing all must approach through the same channel and so it's speaking to all mankind in these Gates so remarkable in verse 27 says and there shall in no wise enter into anything that defileth no wise enter into it the New Jerusalem anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life these three gates will not allow these three things anything that defiles anything that's an Abomination or anything that lies so the gates are not only for those who enter in but these Gates become a channel to keep things out and John is alluding to a similar image in the three gates of this sinful World these three classifications these three channels these three ways that uh we are tempted for it says in verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world all that is in the world is not of the father but he has broken them down if we could say maybe would could have been in parenthesis but it is kind of brought out as a modifier the lust of the flesh the lust of the in the pride of life if I don't have time to get to it this morning we will We would like to look at these in more uh specific terms and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever there's your secret doing the will of God there's a will of God what Master what was me do in order to have a lot of signs and wonders and some really good Riz well believe on him whom the Lord has sent and so here John brings a classification of three things he's already done it with the children and uh the youth and the father and even for those young men he's kind of look at these threes you're strong the word abides you've overcome but now he presents something very different and he uses these three different um things of the lust of the flesh the lust and the pride of life and this classification draws our attention not to God's perfection in threes but Satan's anti antiw word Trinity if I could put it that way something that's anti- word something that's an impersonator Abel built an altar and offer to sacrifice Cain did the same thing as these seeds mature and evolve you find that balum is numerically correct his typology is correct everything he's doing is seemingly correct why because he's very careful to impersonate into to mimic so he can give the image of something that looks right but beneath it it's not right and so it becomes a uh a number that is masquerading as God's Perfection but in reality it's just the number of man in Luke chapter 8 let's read verses 5 6 and 7 we'll skip to verses 11 to 14 looking at this Trinity this anti- word Trinity this Unholy Trinity and I thought that brother Brandon had made that statement I I couldn't find it myself that exact phrase this Unholy Trinity but it says a serwer went out to the seow his seed this is a parable that Christ is giving as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fouls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture the Earth did and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it so here we see three kinds of soil three kinds of ground we see the soil that is termed as the Wayside the soil that is termed here as a rock ER it's hardened and soil that is thorny it has thorns in it Jesus in verse 11 gives the interpretation now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside it's describing soil describing ground we could even say it can describe the stage of a person's life where they start out with um by the wayside and maybe they get hardened or maybe they have Thorn there's just ways that we could look at even the same ground in three different characteristics or stages and it says those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil now there's this tracking the way on the Wayside when that seed is swn it's the devil that comes and takes away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved so the Devil comes and takes the seed when it lands on this class of people the Wayside they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root it's in another place where it says in the El and no deepness of Earth in themselves they lack depth they they lack um a characteristic in order for the word to grow so it's a it's a condition of the soil you have the devil that takes now you have the soil which uh is impervious or can't allow the word to penetrate for a while they believe but in the time of Temptation they fall away and there's more color that's added to this in other places and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection so as we're looking at what we would call The Big Three we have these the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and we have then also here as Jesus gives the parable the Wayside the the hard ground and the thorny ground and and then we have these three different agents when I when I need I'll call for it brother Mike thanks and um they're worried about my voice but I'm just I've been working on my preacher's voice and I found that if you scream in the mirror you get raspy I'm just kidding I didn't do that uh I'm just losing my voice this morning somebody must be praying so there's these threes we're looking at these threes I just want you to see this principle in the scripture very plainly uh I know maybe it seems to be uh this uh teaching Cadence with an evangelist sound but it's uh it's important so the there's the those three the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life the Wayside the rock the Thorns now you have three different antagonists or agents you have the devil that takes it away you have the individual who cannot the flesh which can't fully receive it and then you have the word world that chokes it out these are uh this is the this level of three the devil takes away the word the Bible Jesus in this Parable says your flesh is offended by the word you accept it but in the through the passage of time the flesh is offended by it and you've C you fall away of through your own offense to the word you're shame for the word so the devil can take the word away you can be offended by it and then in the end this third part it says the world chokes it out there's your Unholy Trinity the World the Flesh and the devil now in 2 Corinthians chapter 11: 3 and 4 I fear lest by any means as the serpent beg galed Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ I'm wanting just to use some scriptures to show how to view these three things that we're wanting to talk about and just how pervasive they are and it's not just some Niche thing for he that cometh preacheth another another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him Paul's got some bars I like the way that he he lines this up he says that you preach another Jesus whom you have not preached that has not been preached and you receive another spirit that you have not received another gospel that you have not accepted so with each one he gives a particular aspect to it and so there are false Christ false spirits and false gospels you can hear a false Christ preach you can receive a false spirit and you can accept a false gospel these are these three this the this this Unholy Trinity ma in Matthew chap 26: 33-35 Jesus is saying you're going to deny me you're going to run away from me he was even in the Garden of Gethsemane where he's praying it's three times they just fall asleep and he and and Jesus seeks them the Lord the Bible says the third time Peter answered and said after Jesus said you're all going to leave me you're going to forsake me though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended perhaps recall in the parable of the s that it was those who in a time of Temptation and pressure and persecution are offended by the word and deny it and walk away he says I will never be offended and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto to thee that this night before the Crow Thou shalt deny me three times Thrice Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee and Peter kind of gets a lot of the Flack here but likewise said all the disciples they all agreed we will not deny you and what do we know it happens before the sun comes up before the crows Peter in three different instances with increasing uh anger and rejection repudiation swears finally ultimately I don't know that man not only does he deny the knowledge of him but he denies the Divinity of him the son of man the prophet uh the Messiah the repudiation seems to be complete in the third denial it's great to know that in the end as Christ was denied three times by Christ Christ gives Peter an opportunity to affirm his love for Christ three times before his Ascension do you love me yes do you love me yes do you love me you know all things you know I love you you may know a lot of my Hang-Ups you know I denied you three times you told me I was going to do it right you you know who I am you know what I am you know what I'm about but you know one thing you know I love you you gave that opportunity for that restoration and that Redemption so where there's these big three there's also something else that that carries us and picks us up in Revelations 16: 12 13 and 14 this is where it starts to get real and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared I admire and enjoy Ministries that are able to take uh The Book of Revelation and some of these other uh other places in the Bible where there's a lot of symbolism and even the events that are transpiring under the open of the seals and you have the seals the Thunders the trumpets the vials you have a lot of stuff happening in the book of uh Revelation and uh I enjoy Ministries that do that and I think that I would enjoy ministering on it myself I just have never really felt like you know I I I I've done it in the past but I like to do it when it can be more than just data so uh but if we want to do some data Services we can do that now in verse 13 it says and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and here's this symmetry again three unclean spirits out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits out of the mouth of the Dragon mouth of the Beast and the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles shock Emoji which go forth under the kings of the Earth and the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty it's quite a statement that Miracles that will be worked and these Great Signs will be used to gather people together but not on the right side brother brandham called referring to the scripture called it a trinity of spirits and looking at this in a few places at least a couple places I know for sure he says a frog is always looking backwards he never looks forward looking back always back look back there's your three looking back always back look back back back back so these are three unclean spirits that are in amongst the people out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet brother Braham says and the anointed ones at the end time but when the Seven Seals become and open those Mysteries and reveal them that's when the frogs three unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest themselves a trinity Doctrine against the truth there's that three-pointed club three unclean spirits three uh antagonist three uh warnings from John brother Braham says they're all Brothers anyhow and he's talking about The ecumenical movement that joining together Same Spirit he says and watch so deceiving performing Miracles and these are devils to go forth to all the gods of the earth working miracles to deceive them in the last day and will succeed in doing it it's three unclean spirits though we could do a different math under the the the six seal and the loosing of 200,000,000 demons that are loosed upon the Jews physically upon the bride spiritually and we can do different mathematics but we're not bound by typology we're not bound by the math we go by the truth and there's this truth that in its symbol form there are three unclean spirits that will attack the bride that'll work against the church that they will be for the purpose of gathering people together and their calling card will be the Performing of Miracles working miracles to deceive in order to draw people away to gather them together not for Revival but for death and for a great battle brother bam says they will succeed in doing it now I want you to not only take these things in kind of a this uh Church AE perspective and The ecumenical powers and Theological deceit and the working of powers and miracles that I think in our minds we think well that exists within the stage and the realm of church and church organizations and church movements a a and whatever uh conglomerations we might have or some sort of associations I but yet I believe that that we could be just as real when it comes to our individual lives to recognize that as the open of those seven seals are for us personally and as individuals and that our admonishment under the open of the word is to just live a simple life love God be out there with fire amongst the people holding to your post of Duty and there's a calling that we have under the open of this word that the devil through three unclean spirits and any way that he can use them through the mouth of the Beast the mouth of the prophet and the mouth of the Dragon will try to draw you away from your duty and he does It Well by making us look back wow how powerful an eye openening is that so John continues in verse 18 1 John 21:18 Little Children it is the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come that Antichrist shall come even now are they now I don't know I always say even now are there many Antichrist and he says whereby we know that it is the last time this is this urgency and this sense of discernment that these men of God had that we know that the Antichrist is to come and now that we see it working already within the church they believe that the the finality of God's promise and word was upon them because of the Antichrist how much more ought we to say we are in the final moments and the closing time when we see the Antichrist manifesting himself in the ways that we see him doing so now little children young men fathers you've heard that that Antichrist shall come and we know that he's not coming he's here and there are many antichrists that are working in this time it's that Wicked one working against the church now he's not working against the Church in in a in a fantasy spiritual League uh that just exists as an avatar on his screen you're it you're you're how he's going to work against the church by working against you and you want to think about the ramifications and just how this works and if you want to call it the butterfly effect or however you want to look at it if Satan can just start rocking your boat and then it causes my boat to rock a little bit and then it causes another and then there's this almost a hysteria that can reverberate just beyond our little family unit into our church unit and even sometimes into the broader message circles all by how he can work in one individual and we're living in the end time when these things are very real the Antichrist Spirit working against you to make you lukewarm and poers to make you fearful to lead you astray to get you looking like a frog right there's more reasons than just one to not like Pepe right there there is a looking back and a degrading and we've been reading this from Harvest Time I Think I do have the statement here well we'll get on that in a few minutes on the three Temptations of Jesus the three Temptations of ministers today where they make their fall three Temptations of the church and where they make their fall three Temptations of an organization where it makes its fall and the three Temptations in the individuals and where they make their fault notice how each one ministers the church organizations and the individuals if I was trying to make this all about the threes it'd be the ministers the churches and organizations and the individuals and he says each one have three Temptations which make their fall temptations that make ministers fall temptations that make churches and organizations fall temptations that make us as individuals fall three Temptations to a church three Temptations to a home three Temptations to an individual it's 11:10 I think I've been preaching about 40 minutes anyone want to put forth a i motion that we continue anybody second that okay good we got it we're just following parliamentary procedure here today now let's look at the lust of the flesh if I have to stop in the word let's look at the lust of the flesh if I have to stop on on this particular dynamic or one of these if we don't finish we'll we'll either talk about it in the Millennium maybe if it's appropriate or we'll get to it on Wednesday the lust of the flesh now that we've SE these threes the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life I hope that's kind of a good foundation for us to be uh maybe have a lot lot stirring in our Spirits as we look at these three things a lot could be said on each one of these uh so much could be said and we could look at the Greek words that are used and we could look at How It Was Written in aramic and we could look at it in the context of culture there's a lot of ways that we could break this down I just want to kind of give a real surface over you tying it very closely to the the message of the hour in the lust of the flesh it's a desire it's a craving it's a longing and it's speaking of kind of the lower animalistic instincts that we might have that I need to eat I I need to sleep there's kind of a passion there where my base needs are what I'm trying to meet and you can see that this even has some applicability to little children where the things that they're most concerned about is eating whatever they want to eat and not eating what they don't want to eat and sleeping when they want to and not sleeping when they should like that's kind of that describes childhood and we do spend the first couple years trying to get them to talk and run in the rest of their lives to be quiet and sit down and so there is a certain catering to appetites the lust of the flesh is a catering to appetites and the concern is primarily with indulging base human needs that there's some preoccupation with uh my My Flesh my my my my hunger and it implies not that you know you need to eat as brother Alfonso was sharing with me how that you know if a man doesn't want to work he shouldn't eat and so uh that sounds like a pretty good diet I don't want to work anymore and so there's this sense of if you don't want to do something uh if you you know like I work in order that I might have food to live in order to serve some other purpose and he was sharing that how that he wants to work and with his pain and what he's going through he's not able to so like so Lord if one doesn't want to work they're not supposed to eat I I'm one that wants to for the right reasons but this so This implies not just maybe some acknowledgement of and discipline to fulfill our basic needs but rather a lack of moderation or some intemperance where there is uh inappropriate emphasis on the Flesh and in so in doing so they're putting the body first we can look at this from a spiritual standpoint where is that God is pleased by our faith which is invisible which is in our souls but somehow we want to impress everyone else with what we can do with our bodies and that becomes even another microcosm of This Job chapter 23:12 neither have I gone back job speaking neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food I would say the lust of the flesh is anything the flesh needs that you esteem greater than the word of God when we begin to crave redos more than we would the word when we begin to want a churro more than we would want the word and in in reality be willing as Esau to sell our Birthright for a mess of pottage seems ridiculous but just remember that in these Temptations and where individuals make their fall rarely is it ever in the contract hey I'm pulling one over on you I want your soul no it's you can have this Kia Soul right and there's something being offered like hey this sounds great let's do this so there's something it's it's it's subtle it's very tricky but we must have this mindset as job did that the words of your mouth are more necessary and Christ goes a similar sentiment drawn from the book of Deuteronomy when he is tempted so when we look at this parallel of Temptations to Jesus in the wilderness the devil said unto him John excuse me Luke 4:3 the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made bread what was he targeting his hunger he was targeting this base need and this Instinct that we would act for the purpose of drinking and eating we would do what that which indulges the flesh flesh I believe one thing that is good about it's something I've studied and it wouldn't necessarily make a whole sermon but maybe leave it to me to turn it into a series on why we pray for our food and and how that at the very least before we indulge the flesh or even meet its basic need in order to function properly we bow our heads to acknowledge there's a God that's more necessary there a spirit that can provide and there's Thanksgiving to be given to God and blessing to be asked for because that's more necessary than what you're about to eat so Satan tempts him in this realm of the lust of the flesh remember brother badam said that as these three Temptations in the garden parallel The Temptations of Christ in the wilderness and he used these three the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life that's in the church age book Jesus himself says in Luke 12:23 the life is more than meat it is it's more than food it's more than nurturing the body it's more than feeding my wife and I have had been been having a lot of conversations and I think it's largely due to the fact that we have three teenagers and there is a there's a lot of wrestling with well what how do we navigate you know meeting needs and what is it the thing that we ought to be doing the most and what should we put our emphasis on and these are really good conversations and it's very very humbling but there life is more than meat so we may be doing a good job of feeding our kids and feeding our kids healthy which my wife does a tremendous job she's the food Zar and and so just defer all nutritional decisions to Sister Elizabeth uh because if it was up to me my kids would probably be really unhealthy and they'd look more like me and so I appreciate that wisdom that discernment that knowledge the knowhow but yet even though we might do that perfectly we've got to be feeding we got to esteem something more necessary and Jesus said life is more than meat and raising children is more than feeding them and the woman in the garden when she was tempted notice how this happens and I don't want to get caught up in all the scriptures and breaking these things down we've already used every I think every single scripture we're using today has already been used this year uh by someone at least but I feel like my I've used all these it says in Genesis 36 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food so in the lust of the flesh there's some animal Instinct some base nature of uh there appetites and passions and Jesus is tempted to turn Stone to bread that it might satisfy his basic biological human need to to eat and sustain his energy but Jesus says to rebuke Satan he quotes the word it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that that proceeds from the mouth of God why because life is more than meat life is more than bread and just feeding the flesh so the woman when she falls here in Genesis 3:6 when the woman saw that the tree after Satan has preached a sermon and swed the seed of discrepancy her perception changes and now the wrong emphasis I say wrong emphasis because something was emphasized to draw off sides the word first the word first the word first the word first the word first the word the word the word the word the word it's emphas ized over and over and over again by brother brandham it's emphasized in the word of God the word the word the word the word and then something is spun in such a way to be like but that looks good and so now there's been some sort of inappropriate emphasis it's the turning upside down of perception now she could have looked at any tree and said those are all good for food and I and it's been given to me to eat but once there became like this struggle and this wrestling to where there's this turning upside down a perception and then priorities she was willing to act contrary to even what was necessary she saw the tree was good for food in Proverbs 23 chapter 2 excuse me Proverbs chapter 23 verse two scripture we all know by heart and only quote to others and never remind ourselves it says and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite it's a kind of a Eastern phrase meaning cut it out right it's not necessarily literal but a man put a knife to the throat your throat if you're given to appetite it's the word we might be more familiar with is gluttony gluttonous it's a squandering lavishly consuming the word there uh uh man given to appetite gluttony actually the word means to pour out and so there it's this again it's a sense of moderation that we must eat we must drink there's things that we need I hope you're all getting your Macros like there's things that we've got to have and and to be healthy and for our bodies to for the brain to function appropriately for bodily functions to work in harmony there there must be an eating but we we might say that when somebody begins to give themselves over uh to gems of Cults and and cross training and running and all these things and they give themselves over to a lifestyle and then it has usurped the necessary meat it's life has become about the meat there's a Tipping Point when you're just pouring it out it's to excess and maybe you're not trusting the Lord anymore who can provide there a lot there to look at in the lust of the flesh I'm running out of time I'll try to do the rest of this in 30 seconds in the lust of the eyes it's the it speaks of the appeal to the eye it's kind of what's catching the eye and not just in the Optics in the the science of it or the literal uh taking in of light and producing the image but in the visual uh processing of the thing that is seen so it's uh it's the appeal of the eyes maybe the pleasures of the imagination and it speaks of even the Instinct that we have in our is not to need to drink something when we're thirsty or eat when we're hungry but rather kind of this instinct to Value things that are new things that are pretty things that are fun or enjoyable that's why it's people who really like to punish themselves and feel pain when it comes to certain activities like they're a real Paradox to some of us like you you just heighted in 150 degree weather you just you just ran rim to rim to rim in the Grand Canyon like I'll just uh I'll go to the IMAX right I never got the concept of the haunted house like what's it for get scared I'm like okay why would I do that and so there's this lust of the eyes it's the desire of outward things uh it's a desire for money this avice the uh wealth and good times and beauty and it it has to do with this Dynamic of coveting those things that are visible your your sight uh sees something and then you begin to desire and because something's desirable you act to gratify your sight Ecclesiastes there's a lot that's said about in that ultimately there's this uh satisfaction that a man has in beholding what he has so there's this it can tie to this occupation with vain entertainment uh things that just stimulate the flesh that satisfy the eye which Ecclesiastes tells us will never be satisfied right or plated but Jesus says in Luke 12:23 you say you already quoted that brother Aaron the life is more than meat and the body is more than rment in other words there's more to it than just what your flesh wants and there's more than just the things that are outward in Psalms 119:37 it says turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity and Quicken thou me in thy way we know that the eye is the gate to the spirit and that as we see things brother B says it almost governs all the five senses of the body that you'll see something before you taste it you'll you'll see something uh you'll even be able to see something before you hear it there's a lot of things he says you'll see it before you feel it he says he uses those examples just showing that just how great this sense of sight is and how it almost governs all five senses of uh of the body and the five senses of the spirit it's the psychology of seeing I think is the word he uses and he says the Catholic Church picked up on it that's why they have a lot of visual stuff for you to see markers and events and uh Saints who are propped up for miracles that have been confirmed it's the psychology of seeing Oh my I know sometimes it's the teacher that's accused of being a psychologist but the psychology of Optics and the psychology of seen the psychology of the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes the lust of the eyes it's beholding with the eye that appeal it appeals to the imagination it appeals to the affections and reasons and conscience and it leads to coveting in the heart when I said that we are believing that the Lord is going to address real things in Matthew 5: 28 but I say unto you that whosoever lookth on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart what's happened just the eyes and it's not the glance it's not the Optics of the physical eye and the light shining off of the woman and the the light being received into the optical nerves and through the retina and all the and it being sent on the brain brain and the Brain flipping the image around it's it's not all that it's how all the other senses begin to interpret and interact with the data you can't stop the birds from Landing but you can sure keep them from nesting those thoughts that come in and we begin to meditate on them or we begin to indict them he says a man and this is very harsh and it's a very punching statement when a man looks on a woman turn away my eyes from beholding vanity empty things when a man looks on a woman then lust after in her heart there's the lust of the eyes so we find that Jesus in Luke 4: 5 and six when Satan tempts him and the devil taketh him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said un him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it here's the lust of the eyes see all these churches see all these kingdoms see all these movements see all my Eden and because it's kingdoms and churches you can refer to a nation in the as a female a city in the female sense and there's we've even looked at this how Jesus was being offered many brides here's the lust of the eyes the appeal trying to get him to appeal to this thought of showing him all this grandeur in this moment of time in this instance he sees something is this awesome isn't this great makes me think of a snapshot sometimes that we see of some say wow that's powerful that's awesome but what about Monday morning Jesus is tempted through the lust of the eyes when he sees these kingdoms and then the woman in the Garden of Eden Genesis chter 3:6 and the woman when the woman saw that the tree was not just good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes now we have seen the lust of the flesh working upon the woman the lust of the flesh working upon Christ the lust of the eyes working upon the woman the lust of the eyes working upon Christ and we know that Satan is going to try to tempt Us in this end time and when the woman saw that this tree was pleasant to the eyes it is not beautiful to the sight but it was stimulating to her spirit emotionally stimulating there's a way that we can act to satisfy the body then there's a way that we can act to satisfy our emotions there are these temptations that we must be so keenly aware of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life pride is that Vang glorium it speaks of vanity so it's empty these empty displays it's foolish Pursuits there's no wisdom or substance to it things that are arrogant and presumptuous I just use that it's a thought of it's an empty display it's that it's this enticement or this urement but there's really nothing in it it's not what it purported to be it's what it's what Commerce has become it's what social media has become and to this pride of life it has to do the pride is rooted in this vanity or these vain glorious displays of things the pride of life it's a desire for recognition desire for Prestige or honor some sort of acceptance through activity or lifestyle you'll find that many people today are caught up in the pride of life because they will present themselves in ways so that they can find acceptance by others who present a similar way it's no different than maybe the the skaters and the punks and The Ropers and the gangsters or whatever else the jocks that you have in high school sometimes there's just this pride of identity and acceptance this coveting for recognition this lusting after praise good job you're part of us you're in the crowd it's the vanity of P certain Pursuits ranking clout Karma it's the Pharisees all over again it's the art of showing off or pretending to be something that you're not in Matthew chap 23: 5 and 6 he says but all their Works they do for to be seen of men pride of life they make broad their filteries and enlarge the borders of their garments have we ever asked you know could we broaden our filteries a little bit uh they make broaden their filteries and enlarge the borders of their garments why to be seen to appear Pious and righteous to be like whoa that's a preacher that must have been some service and love the uppermost rooms at feast and the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi Robbie Robbie all their Works they do to be seen of men so they broaden their filors they enlarge the boards of their garments they love the chief seats they love the the upper rooms the Separate Tables they they love to be identified one time a man visited a church Vis he had a Bible in his arm and he said where do the minister sit I was like right there right there right there just take your seat pal Jesus says in Matthew chap 6: 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life remember life is more than meat and the body is more than rainment so take no thought for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on there's your three eating drinking and what you'll wear what you put is is not life more than meat and the body rainment isn't there more to life than where we eat and what we eat what we wear and and what what we display and what we broadcast status conspicuous consumption the way that we like the signal now make it very real and practical for your own life I think this is hits on a number of levels and it's not that we shouldn't uh pay attention to what we wear and it's not that we shouldn't maybe be more uh better with our money to where we buy it once and that's it and we buy it for life cuz it last and we and we want to have good things and we want to have high I mean some of us just have champagne taste whatever that means but that's a term they use and so in Luke we see Jesus is tempted with the same thing I apologize for the length of this I do want to finish in Luke 4: 9- 11 now Satan he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against a stone the pride of life the sin of Pride the sin of sins the very thing that animated Lucifer is the very thing he's trying on Christ it was my pride that made me act perhaps I can get your pride to do the same it's the origin of sin the sin of Pride the sin of presuming and presumption this presumption trying to get Jesus to do what the woman did God doth know that the day you eat thereof you'll become you'll know this is what God maybe wants after all or you'll become as gods in this knowledge that's promised so as Jesus was tempted on the Pinnacle of the temple to cast himself down the sin of presumption that God is going to vindicate me and God will answer me because this is what the word says and this spiritual justification this sin of Pride for acknowledgement to be rescued to be affirmed to be Vindicated each one of these you can say pride is at the core prove you're a Son of God prove you're a daughter of God prove you're a real message believer we've got Spirit yes we do right anybody does that to you say sorry I'm not a cheerleader I'm in the arena I'm not in the stands I'm fighting you you can have your pep rallies and your cheerleading and all your gymnastics but I want the word I want to be in the trenches I want to be in faith and overcoming in Genesis 3:6 and when woman saw that the tree was not just good for food the lust of the Flesh and not just Pleasant to the eyes the lust of the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise eyes the pride of life this is her drive this is her motivation it's a lust to know beyond what God has revealed a lust to act beyond what God has told you to act a lust to do yourself what God said he would do in his time and his season the pride of life in Colossians chapter 2 ver8 Paul is speaking a very similar language to that which he does to the Corinthians and the beguiling the deceiving he says beware lest any man spoil you and we're kind of like I don't mind being spoiled but it means to be carried off his booty Savvy it's exactly what he's saying going to carry you away as a treasure going to steal your away it's to come under the sway of the influence of Beware lest any man spoil you to cause you to come under the sway of and to be carried away captive as a a frog and unclean Spirit trying to drag you back through philos and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments the ordinances of the world this pride of worldly knowledge this pride of life where they use philosophy and vain deceit the traditions of men in ordinances of the world rudiments of the world there's another if you want to put it in that category to spoil you and then what's amazing is Paul says to beware lest any man spoil you through those things and not spoil you with Christ who is the word who is the one we're feeding on who's the one who's leading us but John is the big three the next slide I'm on it all that is in the world the devil sin the fleshes that exist Within These Realms of the world five senses to contact a Earthly home five senses to relate and animate with other men and other people that populate this world money women and popularity are you going you going to be here early Wednesday we'll make sure the building's plenty cool The Big Three the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life John he comes to the close of this chapter so I'll try to close my sermon right here in 1 John 5: 4-9 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world and if you overcome the world you overcome all that is in them the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is our Victory faith is the victory the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world he who is he that overcometh sin the World the Flesh the devil who is it that overcomes the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life he that believes that Jesus is the son of God this is he that come came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth I know there's a lot here I'm wanting just to kind of marinate you with this for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and there are three that bear witness in the Earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one so there's your three still if we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater and there's there's something to be said about the witness of men he's not completely discounting that I believe in the context of this but he saying the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which yet testified of his son what You Know by Revelation What You Know by the confirmation of the Holy Ghost What You Know by the teacher the Insight teacher What You Know by God disclosing himself to you that's the greater witness it's greater than oil pourn out of your hands it's greater than blood coming out of your forehead to know God by the revelation of his word that's the greatest [Music] witness the big three and make you subject to these three Temptations the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life but I ask the question brother John that last Slide the big three pause for dramatic effect the big three or is it the greatest one God the word the Holy Ghost are one Spirit and the water and the blood they agree in one when brother bom is teaching these very things he talks about how that the spirit can be upon the body and the the flesh the body whether you say flesh and spirit or or the the flesh is body and spirit however you want to look at it but those two the Holy Spirit can be on that in all sorts of crazy ways and Powerful ways and hard to understand ways and he's like you can still be lost so what is it the big three or is it just one God the word what is it for you the three flesh eyes and life or can it be one the way the truth the life let's bow our heads and pray musicians you could even just hold your seats for a moment you can remain in your seats if you'd like this has been very direct we're doing battle scenes I could say we're fighting for our lives but you know that that we do that when we drive fighting for Souls we're fighting for harmony within ourselves and within our homes and I ask that you pray for me this morning I want to do battle for myself for my home for my wife for my marriage for my children for our church for our friends I don't like what the devil does to us and I believe that God is doing miracles in your lives there's healing there's restoration but I want to find everywhere there's an imp and everywhere there's a devil I want to search the word so deeply and so completely that he finds every imp and every devil and every Scar and every sore spot and every weakness and His holy spirit Shores it up so I ask you today to consider consider the big three and ask and ask for the one to help you gracious heavenly father I pray today for these people they've endured they've persevered they've listened they've appropriately responded it's been quiet at times because they're listening and Lord I believe as I look out upon the congregation I don't sense any resentment I believe all fears crossed out I believe there's a spirit of unity Lord you've been addressing things and reconciling things Lord and you just watch out over congregation to make sure that its makeup is just right to fulfill the purpose you have for that moment and that time and so Lord I pray right now that you would come and give us WI witness greater witness Lord I don't want to be fighting my own battles I don't want to be chasing after things that have been lost but I want to be in your word Lord I want to I want to know you more and Lord we are not in the word by mentally accepting it we're not in Christ by verbally saying it we got to Know You by revelation we got to know you in that one place the soul so I'm praying for my children Lord this church our young people our families Lord may we know you in that deep and personal way father those of us who have this baptism of the Holy Ghost those of us who believe that we have been walking in the light of this birth and we struggle and we get cold told and we've wondered and we've let people down and we make mistakes and maybe we've offended and we've hurt and we say and do things that we know we should not do Lord may we recognize the casualties and the consequences of the battle with the big three may we recognize the tactics of the enemy in the garden in the wilderness and realize that in the end time we were not going to be exempt from Temptation and that our way out of Temptation was not to excite the same neurons that led us into it but to feed our souls and to purpose in our hearts by faith to walk in your word and do that which is right so Lord I pray that you give us as children victory that you give us a confirmation and a consolation and an acceptance that you died for our sins that our sins are forgiven to our young ladies and our young men Lord May the word of God abide in them may they be strong and may they overcome the wicked one Lord those of us who are in our adult time of life if we've had this experience may we remain true to it ever true to it knowing that what we received in the beginning of our walk even spiritually Lord how that as children it's by faith we believe by faith we are Justified it's by faith that you give us the confirmation of that justification and forgiveness by the holy GH ghost indwelling in us so that as we grow into young believers we're strong the word abides in us and we're overcoming the wicked one let us find Our Testimony Lord and Lord I pray for our young men and our young ladies The Temptations of the internet the images The Sounds the appeal to the Flesh in the most filthy ways Lord and even some of the most unassuming ways and Lord how that some of us walk through adolescence and youth in these things and it scarred us and it made mistakes and traveled down paths that we shouldn't so we find ourselves even in adulthood and sometimes marriage with great difficulties and struggles and Lord it just opens up a whole another level of hurts and things that get upside down and misconceptions and Lord it just sin is not a victimless crime unbelief is not a victimless offense but where we sin where we disbelieve where we're obstinate where we're stubborn where we yield to the big three we suffer as individuals as families as churches and Lord we'll find no other way to overcome whether it be our own Hurts by others or our offenses that we've done to others we'll never be able to make it in these other realms are through these other devices but only by you the one Christ I pray for us today Lord may this may we drive down a stake today and say Christ is my absolute and I don't want it to just be a name I don't want it just to be a number I don't want it to just be a proclamation I want to know you Lord I want it to be real I want to feel your presence I want to overcome Lord I do want to see victory I do want to see healings I want to see overcoming Lord but only thing I can do is come to you the heart that's open to say Lord forgive me receive me into you Lord wash me and make me clean and heal me Lord that I may serve you that I may overcome all that is in the world because I believe that you are come in the flesh to do great things I ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen man
