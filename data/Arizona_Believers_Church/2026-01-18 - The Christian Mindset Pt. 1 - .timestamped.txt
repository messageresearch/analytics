[0:00] Philippians chapter 3:7
[0:02] concerning zeal or excuse me verse 7 but
[0:04] what things were gained to me those I
[0:06] counted loss for Christ yay doubtless
[0:09] and I count all things but loss for the
[0:11] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[0:13] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[0:15] the loss of all things and do count them
[0:18] but dung that I may win Christ and be
[0:21] found in him not having my own
[0:23] righteousness which is of the law but
[0:25] that which is through the faith of
[0:26] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[0:29] by faith
[0:30] that I may know him and the power of his
[0:32] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[0:33] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[0:36] his death, if by any means I might
[0:38] attain unto the resurrection of the
[0:39] dead, not as though I had already
[0:41] attained, either were already perfect,
[0:43] but I follow after, if that I may
[0:45] apprehend that for which also I am
[0:47] apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I
[0:50] count not myself to have apprehended,
[0:52] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[0:54] those things which are behind, and
[0:55] reaching forth under those things which
[0:57] are before. I press toward the mark for
[1:00] the prize of the high calling of God in
[1:02] Christ Jesus. I love how the one thing
[1:04] has so many parts to it. He's forgetting
[1:07] things behind him, reaching forth to
[1:08] those things which are before and
[1:10] pressing toward the mark for the prize
[1:12] of the high calling of God in Christ
[1:13] Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be
[1:16] perfect, be thus minded. And if in
[1:18] anything ye be otherwise minded, God
[1:20] shall reveal even this unto you.
[1:22] Nevertheless, where until we have
[1:24] already attained, let us walk by the
[1:26] same rule, let us mind the same thing.
[1:30] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:32] I'm taking a title of the Christian
[1:34] mindset and what we see here in
[1:37] Philippians chapter 3. We'll come to it
[1:39] here in just a few moments. uh we do see
[1:42] Paul's mindset and he's kind of gives a
[1:44] lot of context to it and describes in a
[1:47] very very beautiful way and he says uh
[1:50] that's he kind of brings it down to this
[1:52] thought let us be this of the same mind
[1:54] let us mind the same thing and be thus
[1:58] minded so he would say this is what's in
[1:59] my mind this is my mindset and I want to
[2:02] explore the subject of the Christian
[2:04] mindset uh this morning we've been using
[2:06] the subject of community to start this
[2:08] year off uh it's not just a a buzzword
[2:11] but it is a reality in the scripture how
[2:14] there was a body of Christ there was a
[2:15] responsibility to one another in that
[2:17] body of Christ but any community would
[2:20] be a unified body of individuals they
[2:22] find something to rally around some
[2:24] feeling of fellowship that you have with
[2:26] other people because you share something
[2:28] in common and the Bible says in the
[2:30] early church they had all things common
[2:33] and we know we could take from that well
[2:34] that means we have to achieve some sort
[2:36] of outward equality where everyone owns
[2:39] the same things or we share ownership of
[2:41] common goods. But we realize that that
[2:44] was uh something greater that they
[2:46] shared was a common faith. And so I want
[2:48] to look at some of these things again
[2:50] and the foundation that cover a lot of
[2:52] scripture today because I believe that
[2:54] the more that we look into the word of
[2:55] God, the more that it becomes alive to
[2:57] us. In Titus 1:4, it says, "To Titus, my
[3:01] own son, after the common faith." This
[3:04] is a a faith which was common to God's
[3:07] elect as he refers to it in that very
[3:09] chapter. Grace, mercy, and peace from
[3:11] God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:13] our savior. So he's his son. There's
[3:15] this relationship after the common
[3:18] faith. This word common could be
[3:20] translated to ordinary or even unclean
[3:24] is one way that it's actually translated
[3:26] in the New Testament. And it's just to
[3:28] imply something um ordinary. But this
[3:31] commonality there's referring to
[3:32] something shared uh uh something that is
[3:35] unique to the believers. Jude 3 refers
[3:38] to common salvation. Beloved, when I
[3:40] gave all diligence to write unto you of
[3:42] the common salvation, what was he
[3:44] referring to? The faith of God's elect,
[3:46] a common salvation. If you're in the
[3:48] body of Christ, uh and you and there's
[3:51] another member of the body of Christ,
[3:53] you have the same salvation. There's
[3:55] there's no salvation outside of Jesus
[3:57] Christ. There's only one name under
[3:59] heaven whereby we can be saved. That's
[4:01] in the name of Jesus Christ. So there's
[4:03] not uh oh, you were saved through this
[4:05] and you were saved through Islam and you
[4:07] were saved through Buddhism. There's
[4:08] there's no way to c God except through
[4:11] Christ. So it's a common faith, a common
[4:13] salvation. And he said it was needful to
[4:16] write unto them to exhort that they
[4:17] should earnestly contend for the faith
[4:20] which was once delivered unto the
[4:22] saints. That faith is the gospel uh the
[4:25] word as it was preached by the apostles.
[4:27] even those eyewitnesses of Jesus Christ.
[4:29] They were preaching Jesus Christ and
[4:31] there was those that came in and started
[4:33] trying to mix in certain things. So he
[4:35] said there's this common salvation, a
[4:37] common faith that was once delivered and
[4:39] that tries to get watered down and
[4:41] defiled, but there was something common
[4:43] that they all shared. In 1 Corinthians
[4:46] chapter 3 11, you might be able to just
[4:49] go back through your notes and check
[4:50] off. Yep, use that already. Use that
[4:53] already. And I don't mind repeating
[4:55] myself. I'll just do that from here on
[4:57] out. But it says, "For other foundation
[4:59] can no man lay than that is laid, which
[5:01] is Jesus Christ." So there can be no
[5:04] other foundation. If you have a
[5:07] foundation and it's not Jesus Christ,
[5:09] Paul would say, "Be careful you who
[5:11] think you stand
[5:14] because you lest you fall." So you could
[5:16] have the wrong kind of foundation. Oh,
[5:18] this feels like it's going to work. But
[5:19] there is no other foundation that can be
[5:21] laid other than Jesus Christ. He is the
[5:24] only foundation. Therefore, if you're
[5:26] built upon this foundation, it's a
[5:28] common foundation that we all share. So,
[5:30] there's a common faith. There's a common
[5:32] salvation. There's a common foundation
[5:34] or beginning. Ephesians chapter 2 19 and
[5:38] 20. I believe this ties in with the
[5:40] faith that was once delivered unto the
[5:42] saints. Now, therefore, ye are no more
[5:44] strangers and foreigners, but fellow
[5:46] citizens with the saints. Fellow
[5:48] citizenship. This is relationship. This
[5:51] is togetherness. This is some common
[5:53] origin or uh privilege that you share uh
[5:58] uh because you have Christ and of the
[6:00] household of God. There's a family of
[6:01] God and are built upon all of us are
[6:04] built upon the foundation of the
[6:06] apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ
[6:09] himself being the chief cornerstone. So
[6:12] the foundation of the apostles and
[6:14] prophets. This is what we're all built
[6:16] upon. This is a common foundation. Jesus
[6:19] Christ being the chief cornerstone. So
[6:22] we know Christ is the foundation. This
[6:24] is the foundation that we all share
[6:26] together as Christians. This is a common
[6:29] beginning, a common starting point. You
[6:33] say, "Well, I I was raised this way and
[6:35] I was raised that way. I was an atheist.
[6:36] I didn't believe." Well, that's just
[6:38] your life story. But when you become a
[6:40] Christian, we all have a common starting
[6:42] point, common faith, common salvation, a
[6:45] common foundation. Amos 3:3. I know you
[6:49] can all maybe just quote this by memory.
[6:51] Can two walk together except they be
[6:53] agreed? It's a rhetorical question. He's
[6:56] making the point that you cannot walk
[6:58] together except you be agreed. And I
[7:02] tried to use this example uh uh here
[7:05] recently and when I did kind of got lost
[7:07] in the translation, but I I asked the
[7:10] question, how many have walked the gr uh
[7:12] walked around the Grand Canyon? And you
[7:13] could just raise your hand and who who's
[7:15] walked around somewhere around the Grand
[7:17] Canyon? Well, then if you've walked the
[7:19] Grand Canyon
[7:21] it and and you've all done it, could we
[7:23] say that you walked it together?
[7:27] And when I made the point, they thought,
[7:29] "Oh, we've walked it together even
[7:31] though we weren't together." So, I
[7:33] completely I'm a I I am a absolute false
[7:36] prophet to a lot of people right now
[7:38] because I they got lost in the
[7:39] translation. But the point is, unless we
[7:42] meet Yes.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Like if you were there uh yesterday and
[7:46] I was there Friday, we wouldn't be
[7:47] telling people we walked the Grand
[7:48] Canyon together.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; That's why sometimes I tell people say,
[7:51] "Oh, do you know brother so and so?" I
[7:52] said, "Yes, we went to different schools
[7:54] together."
[7:56] Wait, what? You have to to to walk
[7:59] together, you have to meet.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; It would be the same time. It would be
[8:03] the same place. And so, can two walk
[8:05] together unless they be agreed? That
[8:07] word in the Hebrew actually means
[8:08] meeting place. that you have some common
[8:11] meeting point. How could we walk? How
[8:14] could we travel together unless we had
[8:17] an appointed place that we met and an
[8:19] appointed time and said we're we've met
[8:21] here and this is where we're going. And
[8:24] so to walk together, there has to be a a
[8:27] common beginning point and I would say
[8:29] destination.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had that awkward moment
[8:32] where you're walking with somebody after
[8:33] you've had lunch together and you keep
[8:34] walking and walking and you both end up
[8:36] somewhere and it's like are you parked
[8:38] here? was like, "No, I thought you were
[8:39] parked here." And you both just end up,
[8:42] you know, in Aenddale and you were in
[8:44] Anthem. I was like, "Well, I was thought
[8:46] you were parked over here. I was just
[8:47] walking where you were parked." But you
[8:48] have to have a if you have different
[8:50] parking spots and at one point you're
[8:51] like, "Well, this is getting awkward.
[8:53] I'm going to go to my car. You go to
[8:55] your car." And the destination
[8:56] determines the point at which you
[8:57] separate.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; There's a lot there to think about.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; So, can you walk together unless you
[9:03] have some sort of agreement uh some and
[9:05] even harmony and pace and destination? 1
[9:08] John chapter 1 verse one speaks of how
[9:10] if we walk in the light or first John
[9:12] speaks of how that if we walk in the
[9:14] light we have uh fellowship with one
[9:16] another. Walk in the light as he is in
[9:18] the light. We have fellowship with one
[9:20] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ
[9:22] cleanses us from all unrighteousness. So
[9:24] we have to walk in the light in order to
[9:26] be together.
[9:28] That fellowship there in the in the
[9:30] Greek is that participation community.
[9:32] We have fellowship one with another. So
[9:34] you meet and you walk. You're in the
[9:35] light. You're heading the same
[9:37] direction. You're being guided by the
[9:38] same light.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; So, there's something that we all share
[9:41] in common. A common foundation, common
[9:44] salvation, a common faith. Speaks of
[9:47] even a common beginning, common
[9:49] possession. The faith that you have is
[9:51] the same faith that all of all of God's
[9:53] elect. Though we may have different
[9:55] measures of gifts and callings, we have
[9:58] a common faith. Though our own faith can
[10:00] be increased, and we can say, "Lord, I
[10:03] believe, help thou my unbelief." There's
[10:05] still a common salvation, a common
[10:06] faith, the faith of God's elect. The
[10:08] faith of the son of God.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; We all live by that. Now, Hebrews
[10:14] chapter 11 verse one says this about
[10:17] faith.
[10:19] Now, faith is the substance of things
[10:21] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[10:24] seen.
[10:26] Faith is a actual substance and
[10:28] evidence. It's very powerful. What we
[10:31] call the sixth sense. Faith is the
[10:34] substance of things hoped for. And this
[10:35] hope here is not the enemy of faith, but
[10:37] rather the product of faith that the
[10:40] what you hope for you're you're under
[10:42] expectation to receive because of faith.
[10:45] Faith is the substance of things looked
[10:46] for, hoped for, the evidence of things
[10:48] that you do not yet possess
[10:50] &gt;&gt; or you do not see, but you believe that
[10:52] you do or that you will.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; And I I only want to take from this that
[10:56] faith is forwardlooking.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; That when you have faith, it has an
[11:01] objective. faith final resting place is
[11:03] on the word of God. Uh we have it's not
[11:06] by sight but it's by faith that we walk
[11:09] by. So if we walk by faith it means we
[11:11] we have a destiny that we're believing
[11:14] in by faith. We have a goal that we're
[11:16] wanting to achieve by faith. So faith
[11:19] has an objective. It has an aim. It has
[11:22] a target. So faith isn't just looking
[11:25] back.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Faith has a a a forwardlooking
[11:30] uh objective. it's goal oriented. Uh so
[11:33] that if there's a common faith and
[11:35] there's a common salvation, then there's
[11:37] a common goal,
[11:38] &gt;&gt; there's a common destiny, there's a
[11:40] common objective. One thing if I want to
[11:43] put if I could put it this way, and I
[11:44] don't want to get too caught up in this,
[11:46] even though I think it's a fascinating
[11:47] subject and it has a lot of uh truth
[11:50] rooted in scripture, but there's a
[11:51] difference. There's a there's a a
[11:54] concept called growth mindset.
[11:56] And it's an attitude of what you're
[11:58] becoming and what your potential is. And
[12:01] I'm not just it's not just what I am.
[12:02] It's very static. And this is who I am
[12:04] and this is what I am. But there's this
[12:06] idea that there's this potential here
[12:08] that I'm going to achieve. That's what
[12:10] faith is like.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; This is where I I begin to uh zero in on
[12:15] this idea of a mindset. A mindset is the
[12:18] habit or the habits of the mind. It's
[12:21] this established set of attitudes that
[12:23] someone holds. It's not just one
[12:25] attitude, but it's a like a group, a set
[12:27] of attitudes, perspectives, a set of
[12:29] beliefs that affect how you view
[12:30] yourself, how you view the world. So
[12:33] there there is a Christian mindset.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; We may have different taste, we may have
[12:39] different opinions, may have different
[12:40] experiences, but there is a Christian
[12:42] mindset.
[12:44] There there's a way that we think.
[12:45] There's an objective that we have. And
[12:47] the scriptures are constantly teaching
[12:48] us to labor to have. And this is going
[12:51] to be my very simple uh thought today is
[12:54] to labor to have the same mindset,
[12:58] &gt;&gt; not the same set of minds. And not that
[13:00] we would all have, you know, this hive
[13:02] mind. If we were all thinking the same
[13:03] thing, we can never surprise somebody on
[13:05] their birthday. Mine's April 16th. And
[13:08] we'd know what's coming up, what's going
[13:09] to happen, and and there'd never be any
[13:11] surprises. So, it's obviously not that
[13:13] we know everyone's thoughts or that we
[13:15] all have the same goals, but there is a
[13:17] Christian mindset that we would all have
[13:20] in common
[13:22] &gt;&gt; where we have a common goal. we have a
[13:24] common vision that there's this outlook
[13:27] that we have even on life something
[13:29] positive something that we we see
[13:32] something terrible or horrible we can
[13:33] look at it and say wow God has a way of
[13:35] being able to use even that
[13:37] &gt;&gt; to to to glorify his own name to do good
[13:41] for us. So there's a mindset that we
[13:43] have as Christians. Philippians chapter
[13:46] 3 as we read in our text verses 7-16
[13:49] I believe we're seeing the mindset of
[13:52] Paul in Philippians chapter 3 and that
[13:55] what we're looking at in this is an
[13:58] attitude
[14:00] a a set of beliefs that he has that
[14:03] gives him a particular outlook so it
[14:05] begins by him saying that everything
[14:07] that I had before I was a Pharisee of
[14:08] the Pharisees circumcised on the eighth
[14:10] day the stock of Israel the tribe of
[14:12] Benjamin uh Hebrew of Hebrews touching
[14:15] the law. He says uh uh a Pharisee
[14:18] uh the righteousnesses of the law
[14:20] blameless. He had quite the resume. And
[14:23] he says all those things which would
[14:24] have been everything to a Jew, a
[14:26] Pharisee, the stock of Israel, the tribe
[14:28] of Benjamin. He says, "I count it as
[14:29] loss that I may gain that I may gain
[14:32] everything Christ."
[14:34] &gt;&gt; So that he s he count all things lost
[14:36] for the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[14:38] Suffer the loss of all things. He counts
[14:40] it as done that he may be found in him.
[14:43] not the righteousness which is of the
[14:44] law, but which is through the faith of
[14:46] Jesus Christ. Verse 10, that I may know
[14:49] him and the power of his resurrection
[14:50] and the fellowship of his sufferings,
[14:52] being made conformable unto his death.
[14:54] And so there's these this desire, these
[14:56] aspirations to know him, to to have this
[14:58] righteousness swell up through him. And
[15:01] he says, if by any means I might obtain
[15:03] into the resurrection of the dead. And
[15:04] then he stops here and says, I don't
[15:07] want you to think that I'm saying all
[15:08] this as if I've already done it. Not as
[15:10] though I've already obtained either
[15:12] already perfect, but I follow after.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Could say all these different things
[15:17] that he that in his past and the way he
[15:19] regarded his past and the way that he
[15:21] saw himself now, it gives him this
[15:22] particular mindset, this determination.
[15:24] I follow after if that I may apprehend
[15:27] that for which also I am apprehended of
[15:29] Christ. Brethren, I count myself to have
[15:32] not to have apprehended, but this one
[15:34] thing I do. Notice all these aspects to
[15:37] this one thing. forgetting those things
[15:39] which are behind and reaching forth into
[15:42] those things which are before I press
[15:44] toward the mark for the prize of the
[15:46] high calling of God in Christ Jesus. So
[15:49] we cannot fulfill verse 14. This one
[15:51] thing he does he pressed towards the
[15:53] mark.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; He follows after this. This is what he
[15:56] pressed towards. But you cannot do that
[15:58] unless you forget those things which are
[16:01] behind and you reach forth to those
[16:03] things which are before.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; So pressing toward the mark isn't
[16:06] something that we're going to say, "Oh,
[16:07] it's right here. I'm just going to grab
[16:08] it." Christ did not think that being
[16:10] equal with God was something just easily
[16:12] grasped. He had to learn by obedience.
[16:16] uh he he was made perfect by the things
[16:18] which he suffered. So he says, "I follow
[16:21] after and I forget those things which
[16:23] are behind. I reach forth to those
[16:25] things which are before and I press
[16:26] toward the mark for the prize of the
[16:28] high calling of God in Christ Jesus." So
[16:30] it wasn't just a mark or a destination,
[16:33] but he realized that it was a reward or
[16:35] a prize of the high calling of God in
[16:38] Christ Jesus. He's really qualified it
[16:40] and narrowed it down for us. Let us
[16:42] therefore as many as would be perfect
[16:45] be thus minded. So we say well that's
[16:48] just that Paul he's just expressing what
[16:50] prophets uh do. He's just this is what
[16:52] preachers have to worry about. That's
[16:54] what pastors that's the mindset of a
[16:56] pastor. No this is the mindset of a
[16:58] Christian.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; This is the mindset that we all should
[17:00] have. Be thus minded. What minded? That
[17:04] you would follow after. That you would
[17:07] forget those things which are behind.
[17:08] Reach forth to those things which are
[17:09] before. press toward the mark for the
[17:10] prize of the high calling of God in
[17:12] Christ Jesus. Be have the same mindset.
[17:16] And if anything you be otherwise minded,
[17:18] God shall reveal even this unto you. So
[17:20] if you don't have that, then God needs
[17:23] to reveal this to you. You need to have
[17:24] this mindset.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; So he says, nevertheless, where whereto
[17:28] we have already attained, let us walk by
[17:31] the same rule. Let us mind the same
[17:35] thing. He says, let us mind the same
[17:38] thing. It's to direct one's mind to
[17:40] something to seek. Seek the same thing.
[17:43] So mind the same thing as seek after it.
[17:46] Strive for it to to to to seek the
[17:49] interest of this likemindedness
[17:52] to to seek this advantage of reaching
[17:54] forth for the mark of the prize of the
[17:56] high call of God in Christ Jesus. We
[17:58] should have this same mind. He said it
[18:01] in chapter 2:es 1 and two. If there be
[18:03] any therefore any consolation in Christ,
[18:06] if any comfort of love, if any
[18:07] fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels
[18:09] of mercies, fulfill ye my joy. So
[18:12] there's a lot that he's saying if
[18:13] there's going to be any consolation,
[18:14] comfort, fellowship, any mercy, any
[18:18] feeling that you be like-minded.
[18:21] So like-mindedness, this like-mindedness
[18:23] is very important for all these things.
[18:25] And he says, "Having the same love,
[18:27] being of one accord, of one mind, have
[18:30] the same mindset.
[18:33] Ha, have the same the same goal." It
[18:35] doesn't mean we have to all have the
[18:37] same goal. And so, well, we need to
[18:39] figure this out. We need to figure out
[18:40] whether or not we're a tennis church or
[18:41] a pickle ball church or a golf church or
[18:44] a bass fishing church.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Saints, we have to all we have to have
[18:50] the same hobbies, the same the same
[18:52] goals. Well, that, you know, that's
[18:54] that's not what's being meant here
[18:56] because there's this outward optics,
[18:59] politics, pressure, you know,
[19:01] personality type things that we could
[19:03] all kind of get very clickish around and
[19:05] we could be a a really good pickle ball
[19:07] community. We could win pickle ball
[19:09] championships within the private the
[19:11] church circuit a and we could go to
[19:13] camps and just really kill it. We could
[19:15] even come up with a traveling pickle
[19:17] ball court and go to camps and
[19:18] conventions and say, "Bring it." And
[19:21] there's a because we all have this
[19:23] common aspiration, this common goal, but
[19:25] you know, WE MAY NOT ALL WANT there may
[19:27] we may really really like pickles, but
[19:29] we may not like pickle ball.
[19:32] They're pickling everything these days.
[19:33] I've had pickled eggs, pickled beets,
[19:35] and now there's pickled balls.
[19:37] But he says that we should be of the
[19:39] same mind. It's a it's a particular
[19:40] mindset towards something that we have
[19:42] in common.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; I like the way Philippians chapter 4:es
[19:48] 1:2. This is just how this theme comes
[19:50] up in consecutive chapters in his letter
[19:52] to the church of Philippi. Therefore, my
[19:54] brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for
[19:57] my joy and crown. So stand fast in the
[20:00] Lord, my dearly beloved, I beseech Udius
[20:02] and beseech sent that they may be of the
[20:05] same mind and of the may be of the same
[20:09] mind in the Lord. Look, it shows that
[20:14] there's this mindset where it's not
[20:16] personality.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; It's not pretense. It's not some kind of
[20:19] forced uh uh, you know, conforming, but
[20:24] we have we have a similar mindset, a
[20:26] same mindset, like-mindedness, be thus
[20:29] minded. Could even put it this way that
[20:32] if we're to be like-minded, it's we're
[20:33] reaching for the prize of the high
[20:35] calling, this mark. We're we're reaching
[20:37] for this goal, the goal of an age.
[20:42] Matthew chapter 16 21-23 it uses this
[20:45] word like-minded or the same mind but
[20:48] uses it in a different context but and I
[20:50] think it helps us to understand what
[20:52] Paul is referring to says from that time
[20:55] forth Jesus began Jesus to show unto his
[20:57] disciples how that he should must go
[20:59] that how that he must go unto Jerusalem
[21:04] and suffer many things of the elders and
[21:05] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[21:08] and be raised again the third days. He's
[21:10] he's not being subtle. And that's why
[21:13] it's so remarkable that when the his own
[21:16] disciples on the road to saying he was
[21:19] crucified and it's the third day and now
[21:22] he's missing and we don't know what to
[21:24] think. It's like, well, didn't he tell
[21:25] you this is what this is what would
[21:27] happen? But he was being very overt
[21:30] about it. Now, this is Jesus saying,
[21:31] "This is what has to happen. I must go
[21:33] to Jerusalem. I must suffer trial. I'm
[21:37] going to be killed."
[21:38] And then Peter in verse 22 took him and
[21:41] began to rebuke him saying, "Be it far
[21:44] from thee, Lord. This shall not be unto
[21:46] thee." Such a boldness of Peter there,
[21:50] but boldly wrong.
[21:52] But he turned and said unto Peter. Now
[21:54] Jesus, this is his response. Get thee
[21:56] behind me, Satan.
[21:59] Thou art an offense unto me. Peter is
[22:02] like, whoa,
[22:05] that escalated quickly. you know, kind
[22:08] of say, "Hey, I don't think you need to
[22:09] die here. Let's, you know, tone down the
[22:11] rhetoric." And next thing you know, he's
[22:12] being called Satan. And he says, "For
[22:14] thou savorest not the things that be of
[22:17] God, but those that be of men."
[22:21] &gt;&gt; That word there, savorverst is this
[22:23] like-mindedness, the same mind. It's
[22:25] this what you relish or you desire, this
[22:28] object of desire. It's what you set your
[22:31] mind upon. So thou savorest not the
[22:34] things of God. You mind these things
[22:37] that are carnal.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; You mind things that are natural. You
[22:41] You have this instinct to think, "Well,
[22:42] maybe the Messiah, he shouldn't suffer,
[22:44] and none of us would like to suffer, and
[22:46] we would want to avoid death, and we
[22:48] would like to be able to draw the sword
[22:49] to defend you, and we'd like to be able
[22:51] to uh uh to kill our oppressors." And he
[22:54] says, "You don't mind the things of
[22:56] God."
[22:58] So if we to have the same mind in the
[23:01] Lord, it means we desire, we relish, we
[23:03] we set it's an object, a similar object
[23:05] of desire
[23:08] and it's something that is in God's
[23:10] heart or God's mind. I believe that as
[23:13] Christians, our objective is to fulfill
[23:15] God's objective. That God has a purpose.
[23:17] That's the purpose that we're aiming
[23:19] for. In the sermon, Christ is the
[23:21] mystery of God revealed, brother
[23:24] Brandham says the entire Bible is an
[23:26] expression of one goal that God had.
[23:29] What a great perspective. When you read
[23:31] the Old Testament, we we look if you
[23:33] read it and you kind of if you're to
[23:35] start in chapter 1 and you begin to read
[23:37] through it, then you'd find that there's
[23:39] a very broad the whole world, all the
[23:42] God creates the heavens and the earth
[23:43] and then it zeros in on Adam and the
[23:46] woman and the garden and very quickly
[23:47] things happen and transpired to Genesis
[23:50] 11 to where now everyone's dispersed all
[23:52] over the world and you have this picture
[23:53] of different languages, different people
[23:55] being scattered all over this and then
[23:57] it zeros in on one man in Genesis 12.
[24:00] one man, Abram, who becomes Abraham. And
[24:03] the rest of the Bible, the Old Testament
[24:06] specifically revolves around that man
[24:08] and his seed.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; And the New Testament is that the the
[24:14] that church that comes from the seed,
[24:16] which is Christ,
[24:17] &gt;&gt; and so there's the Bible, WE CAN VIEW IT
[24:20] as one goal that God had,
[24:23] &gt;&gt; one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[24:25] entire Bible. I I'm reading a particular
[24:29] uh Bible to read the Bible in in one
[24:31] year and and there's little recaps that
[24:33] it has and I was pleasantly surprised
[24:36] after a lengthy diversion on the
[24:39] Trinity. It's like, well, let's uh add
[24:41] my own notes here. But there was um uh a
[24:46] statement that God wasn't surprised by
[24:48] what happened in the garden. This was it
[24:50] wasn't God didn't revert to plan B. This
[24:52] was always plan A. I'm I I was
[24:54] pleasantly surprised because there's a
[24:56] lot of theology that just believes that
[24:57] God was all of a sudden just
[25:00] STRUCK BY SURPRISE LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE.
[25:02] WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S THIS news coming?
[25:03] What's this scroll on the bottom of my
[25:05] feed here saying that the woman did
[25:07] what? And Adam did it, TOO. WHAT DO WE
[25:11] DO? I GOT TO GO FIND THEM." NO. SATAN
[25:14] WORKED OUT in the garden what was
[25:16] necessary to fulfill God's plan
[25:19] &gt;&gt; because the Bible speaks of the one
[25:21] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[25:22] entire Bible. So, brother Ram says, "And
[25:24] all the acts of the believers in the
[25:26] Bible have been in type, expressing what
[25:28] God's great goal is." He says, "And now
[25:31] in the last days, he's revealed it and
[25:33] shows it." So, there's something in
[25:35] God's mind, in God's heart, something
[25:37] that Christianity got away from, and it
[25:40] became denominational, becomes
[25:41] organizational. BUT THE BIBLE REVEALS
[25:44] THE HEART OF GOD, reveals this one goal
[25:46] and this purpose that God has. And so,
[25:48] we got TO BE BROUGHT BACK to that God's
[25:51] mindset.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:53] And I believe that that does put us in
[25:55] the mind and maybe we'll touch on it on
[25:57] Wednesday night that there is there is
[26:00] to be a rapture.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a change that we
[26:03] should not be living just so that for
[26:05] the grave, but we should be living for a
[26:07] goal of a meeting in the air to be
[26:09] changed in a moment.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; So the Bible expresses one goal. I think
[26:15] that's where uh I don't know if this is
[26:18] actually I've heard it before my life
[26:20] for sever many many years but I think
[26:23] the phrase is squad goals like you and
[26:26] your homies you know you have a goal
[26:27] something you want to accomplish and I
[26:29] was that was kind of a working title for
[26:30] this was like squad goals and we've this
[26:33] is what we want to do right this is what
[26:35] we want to accomplish and as Christians
[26:37] we've got goals we've got ideas and as
[26:41] ideas we mean one big idea
[26:44] the rapture
[26:46] manifest Christ. Express the word.
[26:47] There's things that we have we want to
[26:48] do. Goals. So goal was at the heart of
[26:50] what I'm thinking about. But we have
[26:52] faith has a goal. It has an objective.
[26:54] First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 10. I
[26:56] beseech you brethren by the name of our
[26:58] Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the
[27:00] same thing that there be no divisions
[27:03] among you. So there's unity, there's
[27:06] togetherness. He says that you be
[27:08] perfectly joined together.
[27:10] We cannot do this humanistically.
[27:13] This is not even a a human nature
[27:15] joining together.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; This is a spiritual joining
[27:22] &gt;&gt; perfectly joined together in the same
[27:23] mind and in the same judgment.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; I would actually argue that it comes
[27:27] from a place of insecurity and
[27:29] intolerance that would try to force some
[27:31] sort of external harmony
[27:34] &gt;&gt; and to where we want to change your
[27:35] personality and your preferences to fit
[27:37] ours.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Uh because we don't like we we need to
[27:41] all be the same. Oh, I think being
[27:43] perfectly joined together is when we
[27:45] could be such just a hodgepodge, like
[27:47] just the weirdest squad ever, right? But
[27:50] yet we have a common goal. We somehow
[27:52] get fit together like they're different,
[27:54] they're different, they're different,
[27:55] but they all get along.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; And it's not that we all get along
[27:58] because we're all related to each other,
[28:01] &gt;&gt; though. That might be the better miracle
[28:03] when people who are related get along so
[28:05] well. But that could just be tradition
[28:07] or just, you know, the the threat of
[28:09] losing the inheritance, you know,
[28:11] because dad is really really rich and I
[28:14] want to just tow the line so I can get
[28:16] the inheritance at the end of the day.
[28:17] But there's a likemindedness to be
[28:19] perfectly joined together. He says in
[28:21] the same mind and in the same judgment.
[28:24] The word judgment there is agreement.
[28:26] Even speaks of opinion, purpose, your
[28:29] resolve.
[28:31] We have many many different opinions,
[28:33] different attitudes, preferences, even
[28:35] uh cultural aspirations or things that
[28:38] we value,
[28:40] personal hobbies, financial habits.
[28:42] There may be a lot of things that
[28:43] distinguish us. But yet in all that we
[28:47] can be perfectly joined together without
[28:50] erasing those distinctions if we have
[28:52] this mind and judgment that Paul is
[28:55] talking about.
[28:57] He mentions it in 2 Corinthians chapter
[28:59] 13 11. Finally, brethren, fair farewell.
[29:02] Be perfect.
[29:04] Be of good comfort. Be of one mind. Live
[29:08] in peace. And the God of love and peace
[29:10] shall be with you. Be of one mind.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; We really do need to give thought as to
[29:16] what this one mind is, what it looks
[29:18] like, what what it would uh what it
[29:21] would relate to. I'll just kind of
[29:23] foreshadow the obvious answer. We have
[29:25] the mind of Christ
[29:28] &gt;&gt; that there there is a mindset and an
[29:30] attitude. And though that mindset and
[29:32] attitude may work itself out in your
[29:34] life differently in terms of uh
[29:36] ministries and administrations and
[29:38] callings and destinations naturally and
[29:40] works that you do and and and gifts that
[29:43] you might express, there still is this
[29:45] common goal that we have. And the
[29:48] leadership of the Holy Spirit will never
[29:50] vary from his word. Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit cannot deny his own
[29:55] word.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; That's why when when uh the Bible says
[29:59] that there's many now that deny that
[30:01] Christ has come in the flesh and and it
[30:03] could be so bold to say and that's
[30:05] Antichrist
[30:06] because Christ cannot deny his own word.
[30:08] The spirit cannot deny the word.
[30:12] So there's a mind here. Be of one mind.
[30:14] Romans 12:16 be of the same mind one
[30:17] toward another.
[30:19] Mind not high things,
[30:22] but condescend to men of low estate. Be
[30:25] not wise in your own conceits.
[30:28] I find it remarkable just how often the
[30:30] Bible speaks on these things, especially
[30:32] in the New Testament. And we believe in
[30:35] a common salvation and a common faith.
[30:37] We believe Jesus Christ, the only
[30:38] foundation. But in the working out of
[30:40] these things, it's constantly telling us
[30:42] to be humble, to be meek, to mind not
[30:44] high things, but condescend to men of
[30:47] low estate. Look upon the needs of
[30:48] others.
[30:50] This mindset, this attitude, be not wise
[30:52] in your own conceits. Don't think of
[30:54] yourself more than you ought to.
[30:57] Believe these things are there because
[30:59] there's a true nature of the word that's
[31:00] born inside of you. But then there's
[31:02] this other part of you that came by
[31:03] natural birth that has to be shaped by
[31:06] this new
[31:07] &gt;&gt; word, this new life. Yeah.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; So the same mind in a lot of ways is the
[31:11] renewing of these minds.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; The human mind, the human attitude.
[31:16] Romans chapter 15 5-7. Now the God of
[31:19] patience and consolation grant you to be
[31:21] likeminded one toward another.
[31:26] He said it in chapter 12. The same mind
[31:28] one toward another. Now to be likeminded
[31:30] one toward another according to Christ
[31:32] Jesus. That would be the same mind in
[31:34] the Lord. that you may with one mind and
[31:37] one mouth glorify God, even the father
[31:40] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore
[31:42] receive ye one another, as Christ also
[31:44] received us under the glory of God.
[31:46] We're receptive to one another. We we we
[31:50] are welcoming.
[31:53] We are like-minded one toward another.
[31:55] Of one mind and one mouth, we glorify
[31:57] God.
[31:59] If we could suspend for a moment what
[32:01] that looks like and just accept that
[32:03] there is a reality of a one mind and one
[32:06] mouth.
[32:07] Well then how how is it that I receive
[32:09] one and what is this going to look like?
[32:10] Sometimes we try to get into the
[32:12] application before we accept the
[32:14] principle
[32:17] &gt;&gt; and we make it very very difficult for
[32:18] it to ever become alive in our lives
[32:20] because we're like well he wants me to
[32:21] do this but what does that look like and
[32:23] how is that going to happen? Listen, if
[32:25] God says to do something, then you could
[32:28] say, "Lord, I believe that. I believe
[32:29] your word. Be it unto me according to
[32:31] thy word." Mary did not say, "Well, um,
[32:34] in this instance, very different than
[32:35] anything I've ever been told. So, how
[32:37] long's the term going to be?"
[32:39] &gt;&gt; You know, and and blue eyes or brown
[32:42] eyes and boy or girl. It's going, well,
[32:45] already kind of told you. There's there
[32:47] MIGHT BE SOME THINGS ALL THESE
[32:49] QUESTIONS.
[32:50] UH, should I go natural? Should I use
[32:53] the Bradley birth method? You know,
[32:56] should could it be a HOME BIRTH? THERE
[32:58] WAS NO OTHER QUESTIONS. IT was just be
[33:00] it unto me according to thy word.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; And sometimes they're trying to figure
[33:03] out, well, what does this look like?
[33:04] What does this look like? Well, can we
[33:06] look into the word of God and say that
[33:08] I'm being challenged to have a same mind
[33:10] one toward another to be of one mind and
[33:12] one mouth glorify God. Say, be unto me
[33:14] according to thy word.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Whatever keeps me from fulfilling this,
[33:18] Lord, shape me by the word of God.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Colossians 3:es 1:4. If ye then be
[33:23] risen with Christ, here's a mindset.
[33:26] Seek those things which are above.
[33:29] Relish, desire, pursue where Christ
[33:33] siteth on the right hand of God.
[33:36] Set your affection on things above, not
[33:39] on things on earth. For you're dead, and
[33:41] your life is hid with Christ in God.
[33:43] When Christ, who is our life, shall
[33:44] appear, then shall you also appear with
[33:46] him in glory.
[33:48] Seek things which are above. Set your
[33:51] affection and desires and feelings on
[33:54] things above.
[33:56] Seek ye first the kingdom of God. This
[33:59] is a mindset.
[34:02] This mindset does not make us
[34:05] so I would say lowercase spiritual that
[34:08] we become religious and in all things we
[34:10] try to attain to some sort of piety and
[34:13] self-discipline to where well I I I I I
[34:16] seek things which are above. So, I don't
[34:18] eat anything anymore. I think there's
[34:20] people out there said that all they've
[34:21] ever done for 30 years is drink water
[34:24] and and I'm sure that they're, you know,
[34:26] related to the liver king or whatever he
[34:28] is who says all he ever does is eat
[34:30] liver and obviously inject steroids.
[34:33] Seek those things which are above. Set
[34:35] your affections to the things above
[34:36] means there's a mindset that in doing so
[34:39] we can fulfill our natural
[34:40] responsibilities. We don't have to
[34:42] become weird uh uh uh cultist ideas. Set
[34:46] seek those things which are above. Set
[34:47] your affections on things above. This is
[34:49] a mindset. Romans chapter 8:es 5 to9.
[34:52] For they that are after the flesh do
[34:54] mind the things of the flesh.
[34:57] This is where Paul talks about the mind
[34:59] of one who is single thinks about the
[35:01] things of God how that he may please the
[35:03] Lord. But one who is married thinks
[35:05] about the spouse how they may please
[35:07] their spouse. So he's saying that there
[35:09] is a fleshly mindset that only minds and
[35:12] desires and savors the things of the
[35:14] flesh. But they that are after the
[35:16] spirit, born again by the spirit of God,
[35:18] they mind the things of the spirit.
[35:24] For to be carnally minded is death, but
[35:26] to be spiritually minded. That's a
[35:28] purpose. That's resolve is life and
[35:30] peace. We must have this kind of mindset
[35:34] because the carnal mind is enmity
[35:35] against God. For it is not subject to
[35:37] the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[35:39] For then they that are in the flesh
[35:41] cannot please God. But ye are not in the
[35:44] flesh, but in the spirit,
[35:47] if so be that the spirit of God dwells
[35:49] in you. Now, if any man have not the
[35:51] spirit of Christ, he is none of his. So,
[35:53] if you have not been born again, then
[35:55] you don't have the spirit and you're
[35:57] subject only to the carnal mind. And
[35:59] whatever whims can shape the carnal
[36:02] mind, even if they be uh truths and and
[36:06] uh principles and ideals that are
[36:07] scriptural, it's only when you're born
[36:09] again, can you actually set your mind on
[36:12] things above,
[36:13] &gt;&gt; set these affections on things above to
[36:15] where now the spirit is going to be
[36:16] directed towards the word. THE MY HEART
[36:18] IS GOING TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS GOD'S
[36:20] PROMISES. Faith final resting place is
[36:22] on the word of God. So I'm looking at
[36:23] the word of God. I I I'm forwardlooking.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. spiritually minded. But if you're
[36:29] only in the flesh, the Bible speaks of a
[36:32] double-minded man. That's one who's got
[36:34] religion in his head, but not in his
[36:35] heart.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Got Christ in his mind, but the spirit's
[36:39] not in his soul. Then there's going to
[36:41] be he's only in the flesh.
[36:44] He says if the spirit of God dwells in
[36:45] you then you are in you have the spirit
[36:48] to avail yourself to this influence
[36:55] this likemindedness this Christian
[36:57] mindset
[36:59] it's the word first it's a it's the word
[37:01] of God has the preeminence
[37:04] and the sermon the feast of the trumpets
[37:06] and this kind of helps me transition um
[37:10] to some of the things that we've been
[37:11] looking at and this idea of all things
[37:14] common. There's a religious way to try
[37:16] to achieve uh this being joined
[37:18] together. Let us join together. Let us
[37:20] come together. We're we're all
[37:22] Christians or we all think we believe
[37:24] life is good or we believe that God
[37:27] created the heavens and the earth and
[37:28] there's they try to find some sort of
[37:30] basis to come together and it could be
[37:32] thought it could be some uh shred of
[37:34] theology.
[37:36] And so there's a a definite togetherness
[37:39] that would be shallow that would be
[37:41] false. But then there's something real
[37:42] that the word of God brings. So he says
[37:45] the ecumenical move with the world
[37:46] council of churches. He's talking about
[37:49] that this this bringing together. He
[37:51] says what does that stand for? You have
[37:53] to surrender all of your evangel
[37:55] evangelical teachings and things. So he
[37:59] quotes Amos 3:3. How can two walk
[38:01] together unless they be agreed? And he
[38:03] says they cannot. Jesus said they
[38:05] cannot. How can a church how can the
[38:08] Methodist and Baptist walk together?
[38:12] What would what would it require for
[38:13] them to walk together? He says, "How can
[38:17] the church of Christ walk with
[38:18] Presbyterians?
[38:21] How can the Catholic walk with the
[38:22] Protestant?" Well, Protestant kind of
[38:25] says it all.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; I'm protestant against what? Catholics.
[38:31] Reminds me when my brother was
[38:32] testifying to somebody one time in
[38:33] Prescuit and he was telling all about
[38:35] Jesus and the guy said, "I'm alcoholic."
[38:37] AND HE SAID, "THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
[38:38] CHRIST. THAT'S WHY YOU NEED JESUS." And
[38:41] it really caught the guy by surprise.
[38:42] He's like, "What do you mean?" My
[38:44] brother was leaving and he realized the
[38:45] guy didn't say alcoholic. He said,
[38:47] "Catholic."
[38:49] And uh and it ever remains the truth.
[38:52] That's why you need Jesus.
[38:55] He says, "HOW CAN THE CATHOLIC WALK WITH
[38:58] the Protestant?"
[39:00] And how can the Protestant walk with the
[39:02] Pentecostal? He said, "HOW CAN HE HOW
[39:04] CAN THEY walk together?" He says, "But
[39:06] the bride can walk with the word."
[39:08] &gt;&gt; How is it that a Catholic can walk with
[39:10] the Protestant when they walk in the
[39:13] word?
[39:15] &gt;&gt; That's that's how it happens
[39:18] &gt;&gt; is when that you shed some sort of
[39:20] man-made label or identity or some means
[39:23] by which man has tried to create
[39:25] togetherness
[39:27] &gt;&gt; and protect the truth and advance the
[39:29] gospel.
[39:30] you if you you you want to blush, just
[39:32] read the history of the church
[39:36] &gt;&gt; and the exploration of foreign lands and
[39:38] how economics was the true driving
[39:41] factor. And they used the pretense of
[39:43] religion and Christianity, describing
[39:45] any other creed as savages
[39:48] &gt;&gt; and ignorant and lower class and
[39:50] halfhuman BEINGS AS A WAY OF JUSTIFYING
[39:53] THEIR ECONOMIC PURSUITS to to conquer
[39:56] foreign lands and using Christianity.
[40:00] as the pretense for it.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; That's why you have organization and
[40:05] religion and denominationalism. That's
[40:06] how Christ slowly was kicked out of the
[40:08] church. But when you come back to the
[40:11] word, then you can walk together.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; He says it must be in agreement. Not the
[40:16] ecclesiastical system, but the word.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why ecclesiastical systems
[40:22] eventually begin to you have to have
[40:24] schools and you have to have hierarchy
[40:27] and you have to have headquarters
[40:29] &gt;&gt; because you got to keep the system in
[40:31] place in order to keep the thing moving.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Wow. Isn't it wonderful when you could
[40:36] just trust God?
[40:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm thinking about it's
[40:39] like what what does the word independent
[40:41] mean?
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Right? If you're all tied to the same
[40:44] organization and structure and system
[40:47] and you can't vary outside of that,
[40:51] &gt;&gt; that's why I like the, you know, some
[40:52] say interdenominational
[40:54] and and what happens is there's names
[40:56] that become non-denominational becomes
[40:58] actually a denomination in itself.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; When you organize around being
[41:02] non-denominational,
[41:08] &gt;&gt; it must be an agreement, not the
[41:10] ecclesiastical system. There is a an
[41:12] ecclesiastical system that can be made.
[41:14] He says, "But the word." You have to
[41:15] agree with the word to walk with the
[41:17] word. No man-made system can put you on
[41:20] a track to walk with the word.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; There's no uh refined theology that we
[41:27] can adopt. So, if we could just figure
[41:30] out seven, seven's a good number, seven
[41:33] doctrines to put on our website. Our
[41:36] mission statement contains 777 letters
[41:40] in seven statements of what our seven
[41:43] doctrines are. And that's gonna that's
[41:46] gonna that if people COULD JUST GET THAT
[41:47] AND BOW DOWN TO THAT AND WE GOT IT
[41:49] FIGURED OUT. I'M GETTING EXCITED JUST
[41:51] THINKING ABOUT IT. CHAT GPT help me do
[41:52] it.
[41:56] But if there's no there's no system we
[41:58] could come up with. You've got to meet
[41:59] God yourself.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; You got to meet him face to face.
[42:04] There's a way that you uh uh we can as
[42:06] ministers, as God- called men, TAKE THE
[42:08] BIBLE, TAKE THE WORD OF GOD, AND preach
[42:10] it in such a convincing way that people
[42:12] say, "Well, how can you disagree with
[42:13] that?" But that's NOT EVEN IT. YOU'VE
[42:15] GOT TO MEET Jesus Christ yourself.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Face to FACE MEETING WITH GOD, then as
[42:19] the word of God comes inside of you, WE
[42:21] CAN SAY YOU HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST NOW.
[42:24] And that needs to be fed by the word of
[42:26] God. Word coming, it builds faith. Faith
[42:29] gets visionary. It starts looking
[42:30] forward. AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAN WALK IN
[42:33] agreement is when you have a COMMON
[42:35] FAITH, A COMMON SALVATION, AND A COMMON
[42:38] teacher on the inside.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; So the Christian mindset
[42:44] achieves the right kind of community
[42:46] because it has a common beginning, a
[42:48] common feature, common unification, and
[42:51] this common goal. But a forced unity or
[42:54] some sort of ecclesiastical system or
[42:56] human community can achieve a a unified
[43:00] experience, but they do it through
[43:01] outward force,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; some sort of external pressure or
[43:05] influence.
[43:06] It could be political pressure, social
[43:09] pressure, it could be financial
[43:12] incentives. There's a lot of ways that
[43:13] we achieve a unified experience, but
[43:17] it's not done inwardly.
[43:20] community at this I I don't know if I've
[43:21] said it this way but I've jot I've
[43:22] written it down and just in my
[43:24] handwriting my notes as I as I jot these
[43:27] things down that community does not work
[43:28] ex work externally it starts from the
[43:30] inside
[43:33] &gt;&gt; and so I wanted to give a shout out to
[43:36] communism or maybe I'm calling it out
[43:38] not a shout out shout out's kind of like
[43:41] you know comrades in the gospel
[43:45] but uh uh call out communism a little
[43:47] bit Marx was considered the founder
[43:50] father of communism. He believed that
[43:53] science was the means by which you could
[43:55] fulfill the goal of communism.
[43:59] Now think of this in terms of what
[44:01] science has become. It's become the
[44:02] religion.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; And you say well it it's science and
[44:07] immediately if you if you take it
[44:08] between science and not science people
[44:10] start thinking in terms of you know
[44:12] donkeys and elephants and democrats and
[44:14] republicans. No, they're all scientists.
[44:20] because it it it's the the pursuit of
[44:21] the wrong kind of knowledge.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; But Karl Marx,
[44:26] the the father of communism, believed
[44:28] that science could achieve the goal of
[44:30] communism. This community and Marxist
[44:33] communism denied denied explicitly
[44:36] denied the possibility of it an absolute
[44:38] moral code or any kind of divine
[44:41] authority.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Communism has to begin with the belief
[44:46] that there is no God.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; AND SO THERE WAS FIVE SCIENTIFIC, THINK
[44:51] ABOUT THIS, FIVE SCIENTIFIC laws of
[44:52] communism. This is a scientific law.
[44:54] Number one, God does not exist.
[44:58] Number two, everything is material.
[45:02] Human nature is the product of economic
[45:04] environment in which you're raised, in
[45:06] which you're brought up. So there a
[45:08] special environment creates a special
[45:10] class. That's the fourth one. So if we
[45:13] are the product of our economic
[45:16] environment and that produces different
[45:18] people then you have to have the same
[45:20] economic environment for all classes
[45:24] &gt;&gt; to create common people.
[45:27] That's why you do away with the um well
[45:30] think about how communism was trying to
[45:32] achieve utopia
[45:34] &gt;&gt; by creating one environmental class and
[45:37] in order to economic class and in order
[45:40] to have one economic class you had to
[45:41] have a
[45:43] ruling class right
[45:47] &gt;&gt; that's why utopia means literally no
[45:49] place
[45:51] &gt;&gt; doesn't exist because man cannot achieve
[45:54] this
[45:55] &gt;&gt; so they they immediately viol violate
[45:57] their own science by trying to enforce
[46:00] it externally. But there is no God.
[46:02] Everything is material. Human nature is
[46:04] the product of your economic
[46:05] environment. Different economic
[46:07] environments will produce different
[46:08] classes of people. And the working
[46:11] class, say it with me, amen. The working
[46:13] class, the proletariat must win.
[46:16] I don't know the Russian national
[46:18] anthem, but
[46:20] I you can just hear it now. You know,
[46:24] brother Putin
[46:28] General, I don't know who the premier is
[46:30] of China right now,
[46:33] but this is the attitude of communism.
[46:37] And if you look at that, I mean, I know
[46:38] saying God doesn't exist and
[46:40] everything's material. If we if we took
[46:43] it and just kind of massaged it a little
[46:45] bit, but you can deny Christ as the
[46:48] Bible says, in works, they deny him.
[46:52] though they profess them and though they
[46:54] there's a way that we become scientific
[46:57] because we're not truly subject to God.
[47:00] We're only looking to the material
[47:02] things.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; We recognize the power of environment.
[47:06] Therefore, we try to create one.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; And then the environment we've created
[47:10] is the one that's right and must win.
[47:13] So there's a way that it begins to
[47:14] manifest itself over and over and over
[47:16] again in religions and churches and
[47:20] Christian denominations that are spotted
[47:21] with humanism.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; They're spotted with communism.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; And one of the tenants of uh communism
[47:29] is the abolishment of the right of
[47:31] private property. That means especially
[47:33] in means of production and and
[47:35] distribution. So you create no private
[47:37] property. everything's a war of the
[47:39] state because they're trying to create
[47:40] one common class.
[47:43] Now, that's not what the Bible's
[47:44] teaching. The Bible says they had all
[47:47] things common
[47:49] and they they sold what they had and
[47:51] they and they distributed to those uh uh
[47:54] uh that were needy. This was this was
[47:56] not communism.
[47:59] Communism creates by political force a
[48:02] social system that's based upon
[48:04] collective ownership or all things
[48:06] common. And you realize that we can make
[48:09] the same mistake in terms of being
[48:10] Christian to look for well political
[48:13] force. I just want to I legalism and
[48:15] force and and intimidation make ME MAKE
[48:19] ME WHAT I OUGHT TO BE. I RESPOND WELL TO
[48:21] FEAR. NO, IT CANNOT BE BY FEAR.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; IT CANNOT BE BY FEAR OF BEING REJECTED.
[48:26] THERE THERE HAS TO BE FAITH THAT SWELLS
[48:28] UP ON THE INSIDE OF THE INDIVIDUAL. WE
[48:30] CANNOT CREATE BY POLITICAL FORCE OR ANY
[48:32] OTHER FORCE A SYSTEM that creates common
[48:35] things. That's right.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; In the church age book, brother Brandham
[48:40] writes it this way in the Leodysian
[48:41] church age. The Catholics and
[48:43] Protestants are even now striving for
[48:45] and actually gaining ground in this
[48:47] union with the avowed intent that all
[48:49] others will follow. This is still this
[48:51] World Council of Churches, this
[48:52] ecumenical movement where we all just
[48:54] kind of say, "Well, I know that we
[48:57] became what we were because we left you
[48:59] and protested you and and all these
[49:01] denominations, you know, fighting and
[49:03] waring and distinguishing themselves and
[49:05] preaching against them each other for
[49:07] centuries are now trying to come
[49:09] together to form on a some kind of
[49:11] common ground or common basis.
[49:15] and you recognize the folly of it
[49:16] because then once you do that it's a lot
[49:20] harder to split hairs over other
[49:21] moralities like well I guess maybe
[49:24] you know if if you want to identify as
[49:26] trans indigenous that's fine
[49:30] uh you know you can be a part of this
[49:32] and you can be a part of that and all
[49:33] these different ways that people can you
[49:35] start to lose your authority when the
[49:37] word is doesn't have preeminence so it
[49:39] says this very attitude was seen in the
[49:40] United Nations when the world leaders
[49:42] refused to recognize any one individual
[49:44] concept of spiritual worship, but
[49:46] recommended putting aside all those
[49:48] separate concepts with the hopes that
[49:50] all religions would become leveled into
[49:52] one.
[49:54] For all desire the same goals, all have
[49:57] the same purposes, and all are basically
[50:00] right.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the attitude
[50:04] &gt;&gt; because there is no What is it we say?
[50:07] Well, I believe this and you believe
[50:09] that and well, they kind of contradict
[50:12] one another, but we say we're both
[50:13] right. What does that mean? There is no
[50:15] absolute moral authority.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; There is no divine authority. THERE IS
[50:20] NO ABSOLUTE TRUTH.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; We can all just exist together by saying
[50:24] you're God to yourself. You have your
[50:26] truth to yourself. We all have the same
[50:28] goals. But the goal of communism is
[50:30] vastly different from the goal of
[50:32] Christianity.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Notice the name Leodysa, people's
[50:35] rights, justice of the peoples. Was
[50:37] there ever an age like the 20th century
[50:39] church age that has all nations rising
[50:41] up and demanding equality? socially and
[50:44] financially.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; This is the age of the communists where
[50:47] all men are supposedly equal, though
[50:49] it's only so in theory.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; We see it happening now as democracy
[50:55] claims to be the answer, but it's not
[50:58] &gt;&gt; because man administers it imperfectly.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; It's the age of communism and communist
[51:05] where we're all equal
[51:08] but yet unable to achieve it.
[51:13] without are not even attempting to
[51:15] achieve it any other way but through
[51:17] political pressure, intimidation,
[51:19] violence.
[51:24] There there there seems to be no
[51:28] uh
[51:30] calming down of all the political
[51:33] rhetoric and agitation that exist.
[51:36] That's right.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; I know we we tend to swing and it's
[51:38] like, well, you know, this is this
[51:41] happens and that happens. But I think we
[51:43] can no longer view the world in the same
[51:46] way that we viewed it for hundreds of
[51:48] years.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; There it's it's on a path to total
[51:52] chaos,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; total destruction. It's blacked out
[51:56] spiritually. And you would do better to
[51:58] to stop peeking into it
[52:02] &gt;&gt; because it informs us.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; It gets in your mind. Man, I can't
[52:06] believe that's happening. I can't
[52:07] believe this is happening. You'd be best
[52:09] to get up be of a different mind because
[52:11] they're all vying for your mind.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Jude 3,
[52:25] four, and five. Beloved, when I gave all
[52:26] diligence to write unto you of the
[52:28] common salvation,
[52:30] well, I'm going to I want to pause for a
[52:32] moment. I I could stop here.
[52:35] Uh, and maybe take the rest of the week
[52:37] off because I already have half a
[52:38] sermon.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Um,
[52:47] this will this will fit I think this
[52:48] will fit in. This will tie this tie this
[52:50] up good because we're we're looking at
[52:52] how there's a a forced ecclesiastical
[52:54] system. I'm only using communism as an
[52:56] example of a man-made system that tries
[52:59] to achieve common class. We have the
[53:03] faith of God's elect. We have Christians
[53:05] and we say there's no Jew or Greek.
[53:07] There's no uh uh slave bond or free. And
[53:10] we have it's like they're all the same
[53:11] in Christ.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; So, okay. Well, this that has this
[53:15] particular veneer or finish or feel to
[53:18] it. So, then how do we accomplish this
[53:21] through these other means and these
[53:22] other ways? We think, oh, we can achieve
[53:24] it this way. No, it can only be done
[53:27] through Christ.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; It can only be done through Christ. So,
[53:29] I'm only using communism as an example
[53:31] of denominational, political, man-made
[53:34] systems that try to achieve certain
[53:35] things. Jude verse three, behold, I when
[53:38] I gave all diligence to write unto you
[53:39] of the common salvation, it was needful
[53:42] for me to write unto you and exhort you
[53:44] that you should earnestly contend for
[53:46] the faith which was once delivered unto
[53:48] the saints. For there are certain men
[53:50] crept in unawares. So, they have crept
[53:53] in. They've gotten in it.
[53:56] They they're they're external or they're
[53:58] outward but now now they've come in with
[54:01] a different kind of mindset who were
[54:03] before of old ordained to this
[54:05] condemnation ungodly men. I want you to
[54:06] recognize that he's not say he's not
[54:08] pointing his finger at something on the
[54:10] outside but he said this is within the
[54:12] gospel now around the Christian church
[54:14] turning the grace of our God into
[54:15] lasciviousness. So they're taking the
[54:17] grace which comes by the gospel and
[54:19] trying to redefine it and denying the
[54:21] only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[54:24] So it is communism.
[54:27] I will therefore put you in remembrance
[54:28] though you once knew this how that the
[54:30] Lord having saved the people out of the
[54:32] land of Egypt afterward destroyed them
[54:35] that believed not.
[54:39] Jude is a very short letter. You could
[54:41] read the whole thing to get the full
[54:42] context. But he's saying they fell short
[54:44] of the promise because they didn't
[54:47] believe.
[54:48] They left the land of Egypt. They
[54:50] started out in this move. two million
[54:54] strong community
[54:56] that hated their bondage
[55:00] and they fall short. They were destroyed
[55:03] because they believed not. What did they
[55:06] not believe? Did they not believe they
[55:07] left Egypt? Well, surely they believed
[55:09] that. Did they not believe that mana
[55:11] came from heaven? They ate it every day.
[55:14] Wherein was they? What is it they did
[55:16] not believe? They lost sight of the
[55:18] promise. Not just to leave Egypt, but to
[55:21] enter the promised land.
[55:23] They didn't believe the promise as it
[55:25] pertained TO THE GOAL OR THEY weren't
[55:27] convinced OF IT. THEY DOUBTED IT. THEY
[55:29] DIDN'T WANT it enough. They didn't
[55:30] relish it.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; They didn't have a mindset. Someone
[55:33] said, "Well, you know, Moses said that
[55:36] we could possess the promised land."
[55:38] They said, "Yeah, I know, but is this
[55:41] really worth it? Is it going to be any
[55:44] better there than what we had in Egypt?"
[55:46] So, it didn't have to be an outright
[55:48] denial. IT WAS JUST THIS RATIONALIZATION
[55:50] that takes place
[55:52] &gt;&gt; where they reason themselves out of it.
[55:54] They're not convinced OR THEY DON'T
[55:55] VALUE IT. THEY DON'T RELISH IT. THEY
[55:57] DON'T SAVOR IT ENOUGH. YEAH. WELL, here
[55:59] we are. We're on our journey. Yeah.
[56:01] Promised land. Woo. Let's do this
[56:05] whenever.
[56:07] Sure. No urgency, no relishing, no
[56:09] savoring, no thinking, man. Whatever it
[56:12] takes, Lord, I want to get there.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; I I I That's the goal. That's the
[56:16] promise, Lord. But I don't want to fall
[56:17] short of one promise.
[56:21] Hebrews 4:es 1 and 2. This is applicable
[56:23] to even those that left Egypt as it has
[56:26] application in Christ being preached,
[56:28] the gospel being preached. He says, "Let
[56:29] us therefore fear lest a promise be left
[56:32] us of entering into his rest. The
[56:34] promised land represents this rest. Any
[56:37] of you should seem to come short of it."
[56:40] I love how that what we could preach
[56:42] salvation that's so certain and so
[56:44] secure that we should never doubt it.
[56:47] But then the Bible at the same time
[56:49] never wants us to become complacent with
[56:50] it
[56:52] &gt;&gt; and reminds us that the mind is a nasty
[56:54] thing and could convince you that you're
[56:55] right when in reality it's darkness. So
[56:58] we get these checkup points to find out
[57:00] whether or not it's in our hearts.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Don't fall short of it. For unto us was
[57:05] the gospel preached as well as unto
[57:07] them. But the word preached did not
[57:09] profit them. We can think in the even in
[57:12] the Exodus in times past not being mixed
[57:15] with faith in them that heard it.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; The word never benefited them because it
[57:19] was it lacked the foundational faith
[57:22] that produces common salvation and a
[57:24] common mindset.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; So it's a it's it's a gut check time.
[57:32] I guess you know before you go to camp
[57:35] or church, you have fit checked. You
[57:37] want to make sure you look right and
[57:39] that's the squad goals is to make sure
[57:40] everyone's dressed the right way. But
[57:42] here, this is a this is a gut check.
[57:44] This is a fit check. This is a this is a
[57:47] community check here. Hey, wait a
[57:48] minute. What do you want to what are you
[57:50] trying to accomplish?
[57:52] &gt;&gt; I know that one thing we talk about in
[57:54] our family and that there's a maybe a
[57:56] constant uh challenge in these things is
[57:58] what what's our vision within our
[58:00] family?
[58:02] And it may seem like well how precise
[58:04] does it need to be? Does it need to be
[58:05] 777
[58:07] uh characters or would 7,777
[58:10] be better or 7 million 777?
[58:16] There's a
[58:18] a a vision and a mindset that maybe we
[58:20] can't quite articulate other than we
[58:21] know that we want what God wants.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; That our heart is for the things of God.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; That we can be we can be more
[58:30] intentional about the things that we we
[58:32] value.
[58:34] But they did not mix it with faith. And
[58:36] then they heard it and not mixing faith
[58:39] with it, it didn't keep it alive.
[58:42] It didn't become visionary. It didn't
[58:43] become goaly oriented.
[58:46] And this is said of those that left the
[58:48] land of Egypt and afterwards destroyed
[58:50] them all. I want to read from 1
[58:52] Corinthians 10. But notice how in the
[58:54] sermon modern events made clear by
[58:55] prophecy. Brother Bram said, "And
[58:57] remember the sin that Israel did by
[58:59] Balam saying they were all the same."
[59:00] came and I just wish I had more time
[59:02] maybe to get into some of these things.
[59:04] That sin was never forgiven Israel.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; That sin is repeated often and further
[59:09] analyzed and uh made clear throughout
[59:12] the Bible to realize Balum caused them
[59:14] to sin. And how did he do it? All the
[59:16] way into the New Testament. This heir of
[59:18] Balum,
[59:21] he says the sin was never forgiven
[59:23] Israel. He says, "Let me give you a
[59:24] striking figure. Out of two million that
[59:26] left Egypt, two of them went into the
[59:27] promised land.
[59:30] Every one of them ate the same thing.
[59:32] They all danced in the spirit. They all
[59:35] had everything in common.
[59:37] But when it come to the separation time,
[59:40] the word did the separating.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; And so is it today? The word done the
[59:46] separating.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; How can two walk together except they be
[59:50] agreed?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Can two walk together except they be
[59:52] agreed?
[59:54] If you're not walking in the light to
[59:57] the promise,
[59:59] there's a point at which you continue in
[1:00:02] light
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; and the the separation takes place.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; We we can get in our minds that well,
[1:00:10] what we really need to do is we just
[1:00:11] need to try to figure out who's not who
[1:00:14] doesn't belong and just ask them to
[1:00:16] leave,
[1:00:17] right? You don't ever you don't need to
[1:00:19] do that. You probably asked the right
[1:00:22] ones to go.
[1:00:24] Just stay in the word of God.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Stay in the word of God. Follow the
[1:00:28] leadership of the Holy Spirit in your
[1:00:30] life. Do you take these things to heart,
[1:00:33] have the same mind, and those who don't
[1:00:35] mix the faith with the word. THOSE THAT
[1:00:38] CAN START OUT, HE SAYS, THEY CAN ALL BE
[1:00:40] DOING ALL THE SAME THINGS, BUT NOT
[1:00:42] HAVING FAITH IN THE PROMISE, THEY FALL
[1:00:44] SHORT of it. Yeah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; So, what we could do is we could create
[1:00:47] an arbitrary stopping point and then as
[1:00:51] SOON AS EVERYBODY KEEPS GOING ON, WE'RE
[1:00:52] LIKE, "AH, LOOK AT THOSE FOOLS
[1:00:54] SEPARATING." NO, you're the ONE THAT PUT
[1:00:56] A PERIOD on it.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; You're the one that denominated.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; You're the ONE THAT STOPPED GOING
[1:01:00] FURTHER. IT IT STOPPED PRAYING FOR
[1:01:02] REVELATION AND STOP THE WORD STOPPED
[1:01:04] OPENING up to you.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; So, you have to stay in the word of God.
[1:01:10] And all these external things, they all
[1:01:12] ate the same thing. They danced in the
[1:01:13] spirit. They had everything in common.
[1:01:14] It's not those things that should uh
[1:01:17] give us confidence at night. That's not
[1:01:18] what we rest in. You've got to rest in
[1:01:21] the rest which is the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; You have to enter into your own Sabbath.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Cease from your own works.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Can only do that by the new birth
[1:01:31] experience.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Notice how he writes in 1 Corinthians
[1:01:34] chapter 10. Uh I'll read to verse uh 17.
[1:01:38] Moreover, brethren, I would not that you
[1:01:40] should be ignorant.
[1:01:43] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:01:45] cloud and all passed through the sea and
[1:01:50] were all baptized unto Moses in the
[1:01:52] cloud and in the sea and did all eat the
[1:01:55] same this is where it really gets
[1:01:57] interesting spiritual meat and did all
[1:02:00] drink the same spiritual drink for they
[1:02:02] drank of that spiritual rock that
[1:02:03] followed them and that rock was Christ
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; they're all having a communal experience
[1:02:10] they're eating the same thing they're
[1:02:12] hearing the same thing. They're
[1:02:13] traveling the same path. But then
[1:02:16] something happens. The Bible speaks of
[1:02:18] faith being overthrown. Verse 5. But
[1:02:21] with many of them, God was not well
[1:02:23] pleased. For they were overthrown in the
[1:02:26] wilderness.
[1:02:29] What was it? The how does Judah describe
[1:02:31] it? They were destroyed because they
[1:02:33] believed not. They were overthrown. They
[1:02:35] died in the wilderness. Jesus said,
[1:02:36] "Your fathers ate men in the wilderness
[1:02:38] and every one of them are dead."
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; They didn't enter into the promise.
[1:02:42] So he says, "Now these things were
[1:02:44] examples to the intent we should not
[1:02:46] lust after evil things as they also
[1:02:48] lusted. Set your affection on things
[1:02:50] above." He's talking about mindset. He's
[1:02:52] talking about desire, what we relish,
[1:02:54] what we want to accomplish, our goals.
[1:02:56] These things were an example for the
[1:02:58] purpose that we would be very
[1:03:00] circumspect about the things we pursue.
[1:03:02] That we would not go lusting. We would
[1:03:05] not leave following after the wrong
[1:03:07] things. Neither be idolattors as were
[1:03:10] some of them. And then he goes to these,
[1:03:12] it's almost like this alliteration. Do
[1:03:13] not be idolatrous as some of them were.
[1:03:15] As it's written, the people sat down to
[1:03:16] eat and drink and rose up to play.
[1:03:19] Neither let us commit fornication as
[1:03:20] some of them committed and fell in one
[1:03:22] day three and 20,000. Notice how he's
[1:03:24] going down each one of these instances.
[1:03:26] Neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[1:03:28] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[1:03:29] serpents. Neither murmur ye as al as
[1:03:32] some of them also murmured and were
[1:03:34] destroyed of the destroyer.
[1:03:36] He hits on all these different ways in
[1:03:38] which they were either idolatrators or
[1:03:41] they were fornicators or they were
[1:03:43] tempted or they were murmuring. These
[1:03:45] ways that they were stumbled and didn't
[1:03:48] go forward in the Exodus
[1:03:50] says now all of these things happened to
[1:03:52] them for examples.
[1:03:54] I love how that we can look into the
[1:03:56] word of God, look into the Old Testament
[1:03:57] and learn from it. All these things
[1:03:59] happened unto them for examples, and
[1:04:01] they are written for our admonition,
[1:04:03] upon whom the ends of the world are
[1:04:04] come.
[1:04:06] Wherefore let him that thinkketh he
[1:04:08] standeth take heed, lest he fall.
[1:04:12] What are you standing on? What are you
[1:04:15] anchored in? What kind of what's the
[1:04:16] what's the common? Is it all because we
[1:04:19] all do this, we all do that, we all or
[1:04:21] is there something in your heart, a
[1:04:23] mindset? And I I just love how this
[1:04:26] transition there hath no temptation
[1:04:28] taken you but such as common to man.
[1:04:32] So we have a common faith, common
[1:04:34] salvation, common beginnings, common
[1:04:37] Christ, all these. But then there's also
[1:04:38] common temptation. But God is faithful
[1:04:41] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:04:43] above that you're able, but will with
[1:04:45] the temptation also make a way to escape
[1:04:48] that you may be able to bear it. So at
[1:04:51] the moment of temptation don't despair
[1:04:55] because the logic says that with the
[1:04:58] temptation there's a way to escape it.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; So he's not saying that we escape
[1:05:03] temptation but when we are tempted we
[1:05:06] can escape
[1:05:08] the temptation.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; We can FIND A WAY TO BEAR IT TO NOT GIVE
[1:05:12] IN TO AS HE says flee idolatry.
[1:05:16] So we could flee idolatry. We could flee
[1:05:18] fornication. And we could flee the
[1:05:19] temptation and the murmuring. They're
[1:05:21] written for our ammon admonition SO THAT
[1:05:23] WE DON'T OUR FAITH IS NOT OVERTHROWN.
[1:05:26] It's not deterred.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; That we don't think we stand because we
[1:05:30] have common experiences outwardly.
[1:05:34] I speak as to wise men. Judge ye what I
[1:05:36] say. The cup of blessing which we bless
[1:05:38] is it not the communion of the blood of
[1:05:39] Christ? The bread which we break is it
[1:05:41] not the communion of the body of Christ?
[1:05:43] For we be many are one bread in one
[1:05:45] body. For we are all partakers of that
[1:05:47] one bread.
[1:05:48] In order for this to
[1:05:51] have the unifying effect, it needs to be
[1:05:54] Christ,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; the common faith, the common salvation.
[1:06:00] As the musicians come to their
[1:06:01] instruments
[1:06:15] wanted to there's a couple statements
[1:06:17] from and you could find this thought in
[1:06:19] the sermons perseverant perseverance
[1:06:24] I want to close on this just in this
[1:06:26] idea of the mindset this attitude a
[1:06:29] good. He says, "A good born again faith
[1:06:31] in God, a real genuine Holy Ghost faith,
[1:06:34] nothing's going to turn it down.
[1:06:37] It can't do it. It is persistent."
[1:06:41] That's a a mindset. It's a
[1:06:42] determination,
[1:06:46] Lord willing. And I I I uh I've been
[1:06:50] studying for this youth uh
[1:06:53] uh a youth camp coming up. And so we'll
[1:06:56] have to put out put on a filter so that
[1:06:57] nobody peaks in on this immediately. If
[1:07:00] you're if you're tuning in from Canada,
[1:07:02] you you don't have access to this.
[1:07:04] That's the AI filters we have put in.
[1:07:08] All we got to do is just snap a certain
[1:07:10] way and it engages. So
[1:07:13] Canadian filter activated.
[1:07:16] We
[1:07:18] the if you don't have a mindset, then
[1:07:21] you're sub Paul talked about toss to and
[1:07:23] fro. There's that unity. You're not
[1:07:24] you're just subject to the weather.
[1:07:28] And so there's a difference between
[1:07:31] climate
[1:07:33] and weather.
[1:07:35] And what I kind of the premise, the way
[1:07:37] the Lord's dealt with my heart for the
[1:07:38] young people is there's been climate
[1:07:39] change spiritually.
[1:07:42] And and there can be meetings and
[1:07:44] revival and times in life. Those are
[1:07:46] just weather events.
[1:07:48] A and if you're trying to determine your
[1:07:50] the age or the the climate or the
[1:07:53] environment you live in based upon a
[1:07:54] weather event, you would have thought at
[1:07:57] about 10:30 this morning that we were in
[1:07:59] Alaska
[1:08:00] cuz I was so freezing cold. I was going
[1:08:02] to tell you guys if it looks like I'm
[1:08:04] sweating, I'm just finally thawing out.
[1:08:07] And you'd think at any given moment, oh
[1:08:09] my goodness. And that's what some people
[1:08:10] do. It's like, oh, we got 400 feet of
[1:08:12] snow. So much for global warming, right?
[1:08:15] and they're looking at a weather event
[1:08:18] or it's 120 in Phoenix like, "Oh yeah,
[1:08:21] did I go, you know, did I go over
[1:08:23] warming now?" It's like, well, it still
[1:08:24] isn't the all-time high from 1942.
[1:08:27] Hey, there's just a way that we're just
[1:08:28] looking at weather events.
[1:08:30] But as a believer, we're not going by
[1:08:32] the weather.
[1:08:35] And and so our mindset, our our
[1:08:38] spiritual environment, if communism
[1:08:39] thinks it can do it by economic
[1:08:41] environment, then we by spiritual
[1:08:44] environment are becoming Christlike.
[1:08:48] And therefore, we have a persistent
[1:08:50] attitude and mindset. He says it's
[1:08:53] persistent. It's going to the goal that
[1:08:55] God has promised to it. There's nothing
[1:08:57] going to turn it down. It's going
[1:08:58] anyhow.
[1:09:00] No matter what the WEATHER'S LIKE, NO
[1:09:01] MATTER WHAT THE NA NATURAL LEODYSIAN
[1:09:04] CLIMATE'S LIKE, I I've entered into a
[1:09:06] different kind of mindset and I'm
[1:09:07] persevering to that. A real genuine Holy
[1:09:10] Ghost faith cannot be deterred.
[1:09:14] The sermon perseverance, he says to
[1:09:15] achieve anything, you've got to set a
[1:09:16] goal. This is something that's so true
[1:09:19] to human nature.
[1:09:22] I say if you want to do something, write
[1:09:24] it down.
[1:09:26] Write it down. Commit yourself to it. To
[1:09:29] achieve anything, you've got to set a
[1:09:30] goal and say this, I believe. And tie
[1:09:32] yourself to it and keep drawing, moving
[1:09:34] up closer to it, knowing that it's
[1:09:36] there. Knowing that there's something
[1:09:37] there that you're coming to it. That's
[1:09:39] really to achieve anything. Set a goal.
[1:09:43] He tells a story about the boy who's
[1:09:44] flying a kite and he said holding a
[1:09:47] string in his hand and the kite had been
[1:09:48] way out there in the heavenlies and the
[1:09:49] man came by and said, "What are you
[1:09:50] holding?" And the boy said, "I'm holding
[1:09:52] my kite." And the guy said, "I don't see
[1:09:54] nothing but a string." The boy said,
[1:09:57] 'There's a kite on the end of it. The
[1:09:59] man looked up and he goes,"I don't see a
[1:10:02] kite."
[1:10:04] And the boy says, 'Well, neither do I.'
[1:10:06] He said, 'Well, then how do you know you
[1:10:07] got a kite? Maybe just some friendly
[1:10:09] banter, maybe a dad joke, especially if
[1:10:12] the kite was camouflaged.
[1:10:15] Said, "How do you KNOW YOU GOT A KITE?"
[1:10:17] He said, "I can feel it tugging at the
[1:10:19] end."
[1:10:21] Said, "That's the way faith is. Faith is
[1:10:23] the substance of things hoped for, the
[1:10:25] evidence of things not seen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; As long as you can set your faith on it,
[1:10:30] whatever your faith leads you to
[1:10:31] believe. He says, what as long as you
[1:10:33] can set your faith on it, then anchor to
[1:10:35] it.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; You're coming to it. No matter if you
[1:10:38] can't see it or not, you know it's there
[1:10:40] anyhow. You're tugging at it and it's
[1:10:43] pulling on you.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; How do you feel the pull of something?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING BEYOND YOURSELF, A COMMON
[1:10:50] GOAL. AND ANY MAN THAT'S EVER DONE
[1:10:51] ANYTHING WORTHWHILE HAS SET A GOAL AND
[1:10:53] THEN P been persistent and persevering
[1:10:56] to make that that's the Christian
[1:10:58] mindset
[1:11:00] to set a scriptural goal, A WORD
[1:11:02] STANDARD TO TO HAVE A MINDSET IN YOUR
[1:11:04] HEART. ARE WE TRYING TO ALL DRESS THE
[1:11:06] SAME AND ACHIEVE THE SAME NATURAL GOALS
[1:11:08] AND AND LET ME CHECK YOUR New Year's
[1:11:09] resolutions and make sure they're all
[1:11:11] sanctified? NO. THERE'S GOT TO BE THE
[1:11:13] MIND OF CHRIST ON the inside OF YOU THAT
[1:11:15] YOU SET YOUR MIND TO THE PROMISE OF THE
[1:11:17] AGE. The mark of the age. The promise is
[1:11:20] in the word of God. WHATEVER YOUR GIFTS
[1:11:21] AND CALLINGS may be, SET YOUR FAITH on
[1:11:23] it. And no matter what HAPPENS, I'M
[1:11:26] COMING TO IT. I'M PERSEVERANT. NOTHING'S
[1:11:29] GOING TO turn me away. I hope that you
[1:11:31] can look at your life's journey and
[1:11:32] realize this is exactly what's happening
[1:11:34] in your life. The reason why you're here
[1:11:35] today is because your heart, even if you
[1:11:38] didn't know it and were conscious of it,
[1:11:39] YOUR HEART WAS NEVER GOING TO LET go of
[1:11:41] faith. NEVER LET GO OF THE PROMISE. I'M
[1:11:44] STILL HERE TODAY DESPITE EVERYTHING
[1:11:45] THAT'S TRANSPIRED. IS BECAUSE I'M TIED
[1:11:47] TO SOMETHING BEYOND MYSELF, BEYOND THE
[1:11:49] THE POLITICS, BEYOND THE CHURCH, BEYOND
[1:11:51] THE PERSONALITIES. I'M TIED TO CHRIST.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; AND MY JOURNEY in life HAS BROUGHT ME TO
[1:11:56] THIS POINT TODAY. AND I'M NOT GIVING UP.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; I've set my faith on it. I mean, even if
[1:12:03] I can't see it, even if everything seems
[1:12:05] lost, I count everything a loss that I
[1:12:07] may gain one thing, and that's Christ.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Set your mind to it. Have this Christian
[1:12:12] mindset. I'm determined to hold out to
[1:12:14] the end.
[1:12:16] I feel this pull of the hour
[1:12:19] and I'm steadfast. I'm determined. I'm
[1:12:22] going to make it. Let's stand this
[1:12:24] morning. God, help us to be perseverant.
[1:12:35] Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[1:12:47] Lord Jesus, just help us. If you need
[1:12:50] prayer today, just open your hearts up
[1:12:54] to him. Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:12:58] Lord, these words we share in together
[1:13:00] today as we read scripture together, as
[1:13:03] it's preached
[1:13:05] uh by one voice to a group of people
[1:13:08] that listen together. It's a communal
[1:13:09] experience. We've sang songs, we unified
[1:13:12] around uh worship,
[1:13:15] and then we all listen and hearing the
[1:13:18] same thing. There's a there's a way that
[1:13:19] our spirits begin to become aligned. And
[1:13:22] we can look at this in the sense that,
[1:13:24] oh, this is what Arizona believers
[1:13:25] church was hearing today. And this is
[1:13:28] what our pastor was preaching. Lord, I
[1:13:30] hope that in this moment everyone here
[1:13:33] can get away from the the external group
[1:13:37] dynamics of it and think very personally
[1:13:41] that you have a desire towards every
[1:13:44] individual heart here today. And our
[1:13:47] journeys and paths are different and
[1:13:49] even where you will call us is going to
[1:13:51] be different.
[1:13:52] But if we have a Christian mindset
[1:13:56] that we can be in harmony with one
[1:13:57] another, perfectly joined together. Not
[1:14:00] because we all go to the same church and
[1:14:02] not because we all accept the same
[1:14:04] interpretation of different doctrines,
[1:14:08] but because there's a driving force and
[1:14:10] a driving factor inside of our hearts.
[1:14:13] And it's a word that's been made alive
[1:14:15] by revelation.
[1:14:16] that having received the revelation of
[1:14:18] Jesus Christ personally to us, we can
[1:14:20] say amen to the word when it's preached.
[1:14:24] That where things may vary in our
[1:14:26] understanding and our differences, we're
[1:14:28] still striving
[1:14:30] to keep the unity of the spirit and the
[1:14:33] bond of peace. That as the word is
[1:14:36] preached in love, we're coming into the
[1:14:38] unity of the faith and the measure of
[1:14:40] the fullness of Christ.
[1:14:43] May it be more individual and personal
[1:14:45] today than it's ever been. That this is
[1:14:47] not a group experience. That's what the
[1:14:50] transition, Lord, through the cross and
[1:14:51] into grace declares. It's not by
[1:14:53] national identity as Israelites of the
[1:14:56] natural circumcision, but it's the
[1:14:57] individuals who of a circumcised heart
[1:14:59] have met you individually.
[1:15:03] Lord, more than ever before, we need
[1:15:06] births.
[1:15:08] We need genuine relationships
[1:15:10] established between you and men and
[1:15:12] women and young people.
[1:15:15] That that would feed hearts and sustain
[1:15:17] experiences.
[1:15:19] That that would be which unites us
[1:15:21] together.
[1:15:24] Lord, that's what would keep even a
[1:15:26] local body together. That's why it would
[1:15:28] grow.
[1:15:30] That's why young people would come to
[1:15:32] know you in a personal way and their
[1:15:34] testimonies would flourish and blossom
[1:15:35] before our eyes is because they're
[1:15:37] meeting you face to face. Not because
[1:15:40] we've been able to provide for every
[1:15:41] social need
[1:15:43] and every natural uh desire
[1:15:47] through system,
[1:15:50] but that our bond transcends
[1:15:53] the cloud by day and the fire by night.
[1:15:56] Transcends the mana.
[1:15:59] transcends the water. It's something
[1:16:01] spiritual.
[1:16:03] Bless us, Lord. Let us take these things
[1:16:06] personal. What's this mindset you want
[1:16:07] me to have? And the more that I submit
[1:16:10] myself to that mindset,
[1:16:12] the more I believe that I'll feel for my
[1:16:14] brothers and sisters, the more that I'll
[1:16:16] become more obedient to the commandments
[1:16:17] that you've given us, better able I'll
[1:16:20] be to respond to the needs that come up
[1:16:22] in my own life and in my family. Bless
[1:16:25] the visitors that are amongst us today,
[1:16:26] Lord.
[1:16:27] in some ways maybe peeking into a very
[1:16:29] personal service for our church. But
[1:16:31] Father, I believe it will help us to be
[1:16:32] better citizens together
[1:16:35] because we are saints of a greater
[1:16:37] greater initiative and a greater calling
[1:16:40] than to start a church in a locality.
[1:16:42] And Lord, we serve the visitors here
[1:16:44] today. We Lord, we serve them as a
[1:16:46] church. So I thank you, Lord, that they
[1:16:48] could be here today with us. May they
[1:16:50] leave refreshed and and encouraged. We
[1:16:54] love you. We thank you so much for being
[1:16:56] here with us today. Lord, draw closer to
[1:16:59] us even in the worship as we open up our
[1:17:01] hearts further to you. In the name of
[1:17:02] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Hey man.
