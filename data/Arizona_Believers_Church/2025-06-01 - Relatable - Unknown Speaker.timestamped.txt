[0:01] So 1 Corinthians chapter 9 19-23. One
[0:05] more birthday shout out to brother John.
[0:07] He's a real precious friend. He's like
[0:09] family to us. And today celebrating a
[0:11] birthday I may be back home in Texas. So
[0:14] happy birthday to him. 1 Corinthians
[0:16] chapter 9 19-
[0:19] 23. It says, "For though I be free from
[0:21] all men, yet have I made myself servant
[0:24] unto all that I might gain the more. And
[0:27] under the Jews, I became as a Jew, that
[0:30] I might gain the Jews. To them that are
[0:32] under the law, as under the law, that I
[0:34] might gain them that are under the law.
[0:36] To them that are without law, as without
[0:39] law, being not without law to God, but
[0:42] under the law to Christ, that I might
[0:44] gain them that are without law. To the
[0:47] weak, I became I as weak, that I might
[0:49] gain the weak. I am made all things to
[0:52] all men, that I might by all means save
[0:55] some. And this I do for the gospel's
[0:58] sake, that I might be a partaker thereof
[1:01] with you. Amen. You can be
[1:07] seated. My title is
[1:10] relatable. And that's just a one-word
[1:13] title, relatable. And in expressing this
[1:16] uh we're going to be picking back up on
[1:19] uh the service we ministered on, real,
[1:23] relatable, and relevant. that was just
[1:25] approaching different aspects of
[1:26] witnessing as we've been wanting to look
[1:28] at witnessing. I think we started this
[1:30] on the art of witnessing and how that
[1:33] there's uh these elements of being real
[1:35] uh relatable and relevant and those
[1:37] things can be applied in different ways
[1:39] but it's even speaks to the character of
[1:41] our testimony and what we speak to. When
[1:44] we ministered on the Wednesday before we
[1:46] left uh last week or a couple weeks ago,
[1:49] we were looking at real as in being the
[1:51] difference between the reality of God
[1:53] and what man perceives and he
[1:55] experiences. And brother Elizer when he
[1:58] was ministering he was saying that you
[1:59] can't really know God. He says we only
[2:00] know him in the sense that he allows
[2:02] himself to be known and he wants to be
[2:04] known and so that once God has made
[2:06] himself known to you that he's the only
[2:08] one that is in fact real
[2:11] brother said reality only exists in God.
[2:13] So that divine eternal reality when God
[2:16] lets us know about that that's those are
[2:18] the things that are real and those are
[2:19] the things that are true and then
[2:21] everything else may be true or fact or a
[2:24] reality but it's according to man's
[2:26] experience through his 10 different
[2:28] senses and there's a difference between
[2:31] that and so what we when we witness
[2:33] we're not just witnessing to hey there's
[2:34] a new diet drug out there that's really
[2:36] going to calm down the food noise or
[2:38] this is that and we're witnessing to
[2:39] something naturally but we're speaking
[2:41] of a reality beyond our flesh and that
[2:44] as believers, as born again believers,
[2:46] you're actually standing between a
[2:48] divine reality or heaven and human
[2:51] perception. And and so you're you're
[2:53] going to face the world with all of
[2:55] heaven behind you as God's ambassadors
[2:57] and as God's representatives. And then
[2:59] you're standing there uh between there.
[3:01] You're you're actually the veil between
[3:03] heaven and earth because you're
[3:04] tabernacling deity. And those are some
[3:06] of the principles that we were exploring
[3:08] in real. Now relatable as we look at
[3:10] this relatable has can have two
[3:12] different applications and in that you
[3:15] are or the word can kind of mean two
[3:17] different things and so we have it here
[3:19] just kind of summarize that you can be
[3:22] relatable or it can be relatable in the
[3:23] sense that it's capable of being related
[3:26] and like that sounds circular but it's
[3:28] in other words it can be it's it's able
[3:30] to be declared. It's something that can
[3:33] be made known. there's some things that
[3:34] maybe we've seen or we've experienced or
[3:36] there's something that we might have
[3:38] some knowledge of. It's like well tell
[3:39] me what did you see? It's
[3:41] like you can't describe this. It's it's
[3:44] impossible for me to relay that. So if
[3:46] something is relatable it can be related
[3:49] or told it can be declared. The word
[3:51] itself has its roots in in an offering
[3:53] and a giving. And then also if
[3:55] something's relatable as in terms of
[3:58] this adjective is it's easy to relate
[4:00] to. say well someone says well I had a
[4:01] flat tire this morning and I had to uh I
[4:04] had to change my tire and you can say
[4:05] well I can relate to that I I can it's
[4:07] easy to sympathize with or identify
[4:10] with. So if something is relatable you
[4:12] can tell it and if something is
[4:14] relatable you can sympathize with it you
[4:16] can identify with it. Now so in this
[4:20] sense I want to just spend a few moments
[4:22] on saying that we must know Christ in a
[4:25] way that is relatable. In other words,
[4:28] we must know him uh such that he can be
[4:30] related. He can be declared by us. That
[4:32] we're not just pointing to a Bible and
[4:34] we're not just saying that, "Oh, well,
[4:36] this is the truth." Uh I find myself
[4:37] wanting to say, "Brother Elazer said,
[4:38] Brother Elzer said,"But when he was
[4:40] preaching, he said, "You can't just know
[4:42] God by the Bible, even though he is the
[4:44] word, but you can't confine him to that
[4:45] because you can't know him outside of
[4:47] revelation." And so, we're not just
[4:49] saying what somebody else said and we're
[4:51] not just trying to read scripture and
[4:52] we're just convinced that this is the
[4:54] truth. Uh but there must be something
[4:56] that is known, a personal revelation,
[4:58] something that we have seen that can be
[5:02] I authentically declared by us. In John
[5:06] 15:15, he says, "Henceforth I call you
[5:08] not servants." And I think this is
[5:10] important uh because he's going to
[5:12] change relationship with them. So that
[5:14] there's this he's relating to them
[5:16] differently. Henceforth I call you not
[5:18] friends. For the servant knoweth not,
[5:20] excuse me, I call you not servants. For
[5:22] the servant knoweth not what his lord
[5:24] doeth, but I've called you friends. So
[5:26] now Christ is changing this relationship
[5:29] to them. And he says, for all things
[5:32] that I have heard of my father, I have
[5:34] made known unto you. This is the
[5:36] dynamic. God's made the father has
[5:39] declared things to me. He's relayed
[5:41] things to me. He's related truths to me.
[5:43] And so Christ related what he
[5:45] understood. He's sharing these things
[5:47] that he knew beforehand so that they
[5:49] might also know. The things that I know
[5:52] from my father, I've made known unto
[5:55] you. He says, "So I'm going to call you
[5:57] friends so that there's you can relate
[6:00] to me as a friend, not as just a master
[6:02] and a servant relationship, but you can
[6:04] begin to think differently about me as
[6:06] God has disclosed things to me and I
[6:08] know these things. Now also, I'm going
[6:11] to declare and it's relatable. What he's
[6:13] told me is relatable. I can declare it
[6:15] unto you. Ephesians 1:es 17 and 18.
[6:20] Paul's prayer for the church at Ephesus.
[6:23] That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[6:24] the father of glory may give unto you. I
[6:27] just we read the scripture quite often.
[6:28] It's one of my favorites. The spirit of
[6:30] wisdom and revelation and the knowledge
[6:32] of him. These are all things that we
[6:34] desire. And we're not looking at from
[6:36] human wisdom. We're not looking at ac
[6:38] education. But we should desire a spirit
[6:40] of wisdom. We should desire revelation
[6:42] in the knowledge of him that the eyes of
[6:44] your understanding being enlightened. So
[6:46] when we hear uh brother Brandham say,
[6:48] well, you don't have to understand it.
[6:50] Well, he's he's not saying that just
[6:52] take Ephesians 1:17 and 18 and rub it
[6:54] out. He's talking about in an
[6:56] intellectual sense, in a human capacity,
[6:58] you don't need to understand it. And
[6:59] also, you don't even need to have
[7:01] perfect understanding spiritually in
[7:04] order to believe it because faith is
[7:06] something that that knows on its own
[7:08] accord. It's a personal revelation. And
[7:10] then with that anchor and with that
[7:12] foundation, we want the spirit of wisdom
[7:13] and revelation and the knowledge of him.
[7:15] And that we can have our eyes of
[7:17] understanding enlightened that you may
[7:18] know what is the hope. And maybe just
[7:20] jot this down in a margin of your notes
[7:23] so you can see this. What is the hope of
[7:24] his calling and what the riches of the
[7:26] glory of his inheritance in the saints?
[7:28] And he keeps going and it's several
[7:30] verses before you really find the period
[7:32] here. But this is something saying,"I
[7:34] want you to know these things as uh
[7:38] reliable witnesses in the sense that
[7:39] it's real to you. You've seen it
[7:41] yourself. But now in the sense to where
[7:42] this is knowledge that you have that is
[7:46] so real to you that there's a way that
[7:48] it can be conveyed itself."
[7:50] Philippians 3:10, that I may know him.
[7:53] This is what Paul desired for himself.
[7:55] That I may know him and the power of his
[7:58] resurrection. That's something only God
[7:59] can do. Raise the dead and the
[8:01] fellowship of his sufferings. This is
[8:03] something that God condescended to being
[8:05] made conformable unto his death. What
[8:07] Paul wanted to know here is not tell me
[8:09] more facts, tell me more details. He
[8:11] wasn't sitting at the feet of the
[8:12] apostles and saying now what was he
[8:14] doing on June 1st and what was he doing
[8:15] this day and that day? But he wanted to
[8:17] know him more deeply and more
[8:19] intimately. This is something that I may
[8:21] know him that the there can just be this
[8:24] further uh development of a knowledge of
[8:26] God. Not that he would ever exhaust it,
[8:29] not that he could ever contain all of
[8:30] it, but he wanted to know him
[8:32] more. So there I just share that that
[8:35] little bit so that we could have this
[8:37] understanding that Christ must be
[8:40] relatable to
[8:42] us and that there there must be this
[8:44] knowledge, this revelation, this
[8:46] understanding that we have that can be
[8:50] declared. Now, before you think, wow, do
[8:52] I have to be able to explain this? Am I
[8:54] going to be tested on this? uh I'm going
[8:56] to pass out the blue books and you're
[8:57] going to have to write a five-page essay
[8:59] on who Jesus Christ is. No, but that
[9:01] it's something real to you. Therefore,
[9:03] you're there's a glory that's in you.
[9:06] There's life that's in you that then can
[9:08] be expressed through characteristics.
[9:11] And so, it's something real, tangible in
[9:14] you as a faith and as a life. And
[9:16] therefore, you know Christ, you know
[9:18] him. That's what you're anchored in. And
[9:19] therefore he is to you something that
[9:21] you identify with, something that you
[9:23] know and can be comp capable of
[9:27] expressing. Now I want to look at this
[9:29] in a different aspect and it's drawing
[9:31] from maybe one of these other uh same
[9:33] uses but now just in a little bit
[9:34] different way. We must ourselves now
[9:37] having been awakened to a divine reality
[9:39] we still need to be relatable and to be
[9:42] able to relate to others. So there has
[9:44] to be you want others you want to be
[9:47] others to be able to relate to you
[9:48] relatable to others and you should be
[9:50] able to have a feeling and relate to
[9:52] other people so that the gospel can be
[9:56] related by you. So you want someone to
[10:00] uh brother man was told if you can get
[10:01] the people to believe to believe you
[10:03] have confidence in you nothing will
[10:05] stand in your way. Amen. And and that is
[10:08] something that he said was one of the
[10:09] hardest things you could do is to get
[10:10] another mortal man to believe and to
[10:12] listen to another man. And so it's a
[10:14] difficult thing. But when someone can
[10:15] relate to you and oh well he's a human
[10:18] being he's he suffered like I have or
[10:20] he's been here he's done this uh then
[10:22] that's an important component. And then
[10:23] when you as the one who's conveying
[10:26] truth are going to be the one that
[10:27] relates when you can relate to others
[10:29] and you could say well man I know
[10:31] exactly what they need and that's a
[10:33] swift kick to the shins and and then you
[10:36] realize well you know what that's
[10:37] probably not what's best for him and
[10:38] that's maybe not the way I should go
[10:39] about this. Then when you begin to enter
[10:41] into somebody else's suffering, it makes
[10:42] you more a more effective witness so
[10:45] that you can relate Christ to others.
[10:48] This is how Paul put it as we read it
[10:50] already in 1 Corinthians chapter 9. I'd
[10:52] like to just go ahead and reread these
[10:55] verses with
[10:57] you. For though I be free from all men,
[11:00] so he's not a servant to man. He's not
[11:02] into bondage. He's not a slave of any
[11:05] kind. And though I be free, I use this
[11:07] liberty. Yet have I made myself servant
[11:10] unto all. I take my liberty to serve all
[11:12] that I might gain the more. The concept
[11:14] or idea here is not just winning friends
[11:17] and influencing people, but it's a
[11:18] concept of souls being saved. Gain the
[11:21] more. It's winning souls to Christ.
[11:24] Verse 20. And unto the Jews I became as
[11:26] a Jew. This is how he says, I I've made
[11:29] myself servant unto all around the Jews.
[11:32] I became as a Jew that I might gain the
[11:34] Jews. Follow what he's saying here. Gain
[11:36] the Jews means get their confidence.
[11:38] Minister the gospel to them. See that
[11:40] souls are saved from them. To them that
[11:42] are under the law as under the law. To
[11:44] the Gentiles who are without the law
[11:46] who've now observing uh Judaism or even
[11:49] Christian Gentiles who are now still
[11:51] trying to keep the law. He says as under
[11:53] the law that I might gain them that are
[11:55] under the law. To them that are without
[11:57] the law. As without the law. He knows
[12:00] how if he's with Jews, he's going to
[12:02] kind of relate to Jews. If he's with the
[12:04] Gentiles, he's going to relate to
[12:05] Gentiles. And he says, "Then them that
[12:06] are without the law, without the law."
[12:08] And then there's some of us here who are
[12:10] thinking,
[12:11] "Yes, yes, I'm going to be a witness in
[12:15] Vegas. I have my I got my calling this
[12:18] morning, Brother Aaron." And but he
[12:21] says, "Being not without law to God, but
[12:24] under the law to Christ." Amen. So he
[12:26] was not going to do this at the expense
[12:28] of confusing the gospel or not obeying
[12:31] Christ. He still was subject to Christ
[12:33] in obedience to his word. But why is he
[12:34] doing all this? That I might gain them
[12:36] that are without
[12:38] law. Continues to the weak became I as
[12:42] weak. He didn't posture himself to be
[12:45] appear stronger and more revelated and
[12:47] and more articulate. And he didn't try
[12:49] to position himself as the know-it-all
[12:50] around those that are weak. But he
[12:52] actually became weak to them.
[12:54] that there's times maybe we're tempted
[12:56] in ourselves to try to come off as we
[12:58] got all our stuff together and we're
[12:59] really strong and we've never gotten
[13:00] sick. We've never doubted a day in our
[13:02] lives and you get around people saying,
[13:03] "Man, I'm really going through it. This
[13:04] has been a really hard
[13:05] week." You suffer and where's your
[13:08] faith, man. Come on, suck it up,
[13:09] buttercup. You know that you're the
[13:11] bride of Jesus Christ. You shouldn't be
[13:13] acting like that. You like, man, I know
[13:14] what it means. He said, I became weak to
[13:17] the weak. Why? That I might by all
[13:20] means, he said, that I might gain the
[13:22] weak. Amen. If you if if the weak don't
[13:26] think that you understand them, they're
[13:28] not going to be selling what you buying
[13:30] what you're selling for strength.
[13:33] If they don't if they're not if they
[13:34] don't feel that they're understood, if
[13:36] you're not relating to them, then do you
[13:37] really even know what they need? But he
[13:38] says, I became like them in some sense.
[13:40] I became as weak that I could save a
[13:43] weak soul. Then he summarizes, I am made
[13:46] all things to all men. That may be the
[13:48] phrase that you're most familiar with. I
[13:49] am made all things all men that I might
[13:51] by all means save some. I'm not going to
[13:53] be able to save all. I'm not going to be
[13:54] able to save every soul. But if I could
[13:56] just save some, I'm willing to humble
[13:58] myself, be more human and vulnerable so
[14:00] that I could save some. And this I do
[14:02] not for his own sake, but for the gospel
[14:04] sake that I might be partaker thereof
[14:06] with you. Amen. The Living Bible
[14:08] translates some of these verses. I was
[14:10] going to read the whole thing, but one
[14:11] says, "Whatever a person is like, I try
[14:13] to find common ground with him so that
[14:15] he will let me tell him about Christ and
[14:18] let Christ save him." He's looking for
[14:20] common ground, some relatability. I do
[14:23] this to get the gospel to them and also
[14:24] for the blessing I myself receive when I
[14:27] see them come to Christ, a partaker with
[14:30] you. He's saying that he assumed, if we
[14:32] could even just use maybe geometry, a
[14:35] shape or form. He assumed every shape,
[14:37] every form in order to be relatable to
[14:40] others and to relate to them, but yet he
[14:43] maintained his faithfulness to Christ
[14:45] and stayed true to the word. He wasn't
[14:47] doing it outside the nature of Christ.
[14:49] He wasn't saying, "Well, I became a
[14:50] sinner. I became a drunker." We were uh
[14:53] Preston and I were listening to uh the
[14:55] radio and a lawyer came on and he said
[14:58] I'm so and so and I I sue uh uh truck
[15:03] drivers and u Preston thought he said
[15:06] drunk drivers and so he says a lot of
[15:08] you don't know this but my dad was a a
[15:10] truck driver and he's like his dad was a
[15:12] drunk driver. He's like why is this
[15:13] lawyer throwing his dad under the bus?
[15:15] And uh and so there was uh I don't even
[15:18] know why I'm telling this story. Where
[15:19] was I? But uh it's not that we would
[15:22] become truck drivers or drunk drivers.
[15:24] We have to become something else. But we
[15:25] have to be able to find this common
[15:28] ground. I find common ground with them.
[15:30] To the Jew, to the Gentile, to the to
[15:32] the heathen, to those under the law,
[15:34] without the law, he became agreeable to
[15:36] the Jews. He became agreeable to the
[15:37] Gentiles. He observed th those Gentiles
[15:40] observing Jewish customs that he's
[15:42] rejected. And even to the heathen, he
[15:45] became agreeable.
[15:47] One translation says, "And so by
[15:49] agreeing I can win their confidence and
[15:51] help them too." What was he doing in the
[15:54] circumstance and the situation depending
[15:55] on those that were in front of him?
[15:56] There was some adapting or
[15:58] accommodating, but the goal at the whole
[16:00] time was to reach the lost. Wasn't to
[16:02] blend in and be confused as a heathen.
[16:04] It wasn't to blend in and go right back
[16:06] into being a Jew again, but the goal was
[16:08] to reach the lost. He says for the
[16:10] gospel sake to promote its success to
[16:13] the the utmost of his ability. I want to
[16:15] do this so that the gospel the word can
[16:17] be effective. Even conformed himself uh
[16:21] uh to the feeling of each one of these
[16:22] classes to what? To win
[16:25] some. He did this not to fit in. He
[16:28] didn't do this for his own popularity.
[16:30] He didn't do it so that he could uh kind
[16:32] of be all things to all men and just be
[16:34] some sort of maven. he could just get
[16:36] into every circle and take advantage of
[16:38] social relationships. His he had the
[16:40] gospel in mind.
[16:42] Now in the sermon God's covenant with
[16:44] Abraham and his seed, brother Benam
[16:48] around these paragraphs, he's delving in
[16:50] this a little bit more in this aspect of
[16:52] his relationship to his wife and how
[16:54] love is expressed. He says filelio love
[16:56] and agape love as we've said is are two
[16:59] different things. says, "But when you
[17:01] divinely love Christ like you love your
[17:04] wife, only it'll be greater, higher
[17:07] level than this is down here." So he's
[17:09] talking about Felio and Agape. And he
[17:11] says, "Oh, don't worry. You'll be about
[17:13] the father's business, trying to win
[17:15] souls and pray for the sick and do
[17:17] everything you can because you love him.
[17:19] You want to please him." You see the
[17:22] kind of the foundation, the area he's
[17:23] dealing in that if you really love God,
[17:25] then you have a burden for lost souls,
[17:27] right? Um you want to pray for the sick
[17:29] when they're not well. You want to do
[17:30] everything you can because you love God.
[17:32] You know what his word has empowered you
[17:34] to do. You know what pleases God. So
[17:35] love is what causes us to have a burden
[17:38] to be a witness to save to save souls.
[17:40] We're not going to work our way
[17:41] backwards into that. So I just want to
[17:43] be a witness. No, you love God.
[17:44] Therefore, you you want to please him.
[17:46] So then he immediately says, "Oh, you
[17:48] think, God, I know where there's a
[17:49] fellow that I believe that I could lead
[17:51] lead to you and away you'll go and talk
[17:54] to him in a nice way." So you have a
[17:56] burden. Lord, lay some soul upon my
[17:58] heart and love that soul through me and
[18:02] let me ever do my part uh to win that
[18:05] soul to thee. So he says, you have
[18:07] somebody. Oh, I know somebody that I
[18:08] could lead to you. And you go talk to
[18:10] him in a nice way. How do you do,
[18:13] John? He says, I want to talk to you
[18:16] tonight about going
[18:17] fishing. And we like that. Don't we like
[18:21] this? Where's William when you need him?
[18:23] You talk to him about going fishing.
[18:24] Yes. Oh, I love to fish. He says, "Talk
[18:27] fishing to him for a
[18:29] while. Talk about his chickens or
[18:32] whatever whatever farming he's doing
[18:34] going to do for a while." Oh, there used
[18:36] to be a time that chickens were I
[18:38] thought maybe more of a rarity, but man,
[18:40] everybody's raising chickens. I don't
[18:41] know if it's the price of eggs or what
[18:43] it is, but everybody's got
[18:46] chickens, it says, or farming or
[18:48] whatever he's doing going to do for a
[18:49] while until God opens up the way and
[18:53] gives you a chance to send home the
[18:55] gospel.
[18:56] So the basis is not, oh, I know John
[18:58] really needs the Lord. Knock knock.
[19:00] Who's there? Your last chance
[19:02] sinner. Your last chance sinner. Who?
[19:05] Sinner you. You know, it's not it's it's
[19:08] hey, let me talk to you about farming or
[19:10] fishing or some common ground, some
[19:11] basis. And then through that
[19:13] camaraderie, through that commonality,
[19:15] through those things you're talking
[19:16] about, you watch God. He says, God open
[19:19] up the way and give you a chance to send
[19:20] home the gospel. Then when you win that
[19:22] soul, you present it before the father.
[19:24] Like I said, I did that little present
[19:25] to my wife here. Father, what happiness
[19:27] you do it because you love it. Not a
[19:29] duty, but a love. So when we love the
[19:31] Lord, we have a burden for lost souls.
[19:33] We want to see that others can come to
[19:34] know the love of God as we do. And
[19:37] therefore, we have this sensitivity that
[19:39] as I talk to people and get to know
[19:41] them. And if I'm ever really going to be
[19:43] an effective witness, then I'm I'm not
[19:45] trying to lead with, well, have you ever
[19:47] had an abortion? How were you baptized?
[19:48] And have you been married before? And do
[19:50] you have this? You don't need to lead in
[19:52] with those things. That's right. In
[19:54] Matthew chapter
[19:57] 10:16, he says,
[19:59] "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in
[20:02] the midst of wolves." Thanks, pastor,
[20:06] shepherd. I send you forth. I'm
[20:08] commissioning. I'm sending you. So, this
[20:10] is something he's doing. He's sending
[20:12] them and he's apprising them of the
[20:14] dangers of ministry, of witnessing, of
[20:15] living in a world uh that is sinful. I
[20:18] send you forth and you are going to be
[20:19] as sheep in the midst of wolves that
[20:21] would want to destroy you. He's he's
[20:23] kind of raising the spectre. There's
[20:25] going to be persecution. So he says, "Be
[20:27] therefore wise as serpents and harmless
[20:30] as
[20:31] doves." Quite a statement, but there's
[20:33] so much in this word picture that he
[20:35] shares with us that there be wise as
[20:37] serpents. It kind of conveys this sense
[20:38] of being sharpsided. You have kind of
[20:41] this wisdom, this little circumspectness
[20:43] to where you're very cunning about your
[20:45] own protection. I know, you know, snake
[20:48] snakes get a bad name and it's not not
[20:50] Genesis chapter 3 really doesn't do them
[20:51] a lot of good, but you know, serpents
[20:53] get a bad name, but you know, there's
[20:55] when a snake coils and starts shaking
[20:57] its rattle, they're they're kind of
[20:58] letting you know, hey,
[21:00] leave me alone, right? I I I I don't
[21:04] want to have to defend myself. And
[21:05] you'll find a lot of times with nature
[21:07] that when whether it be a moose or it's
[21:09] an elk that when they're really really
[21:10] aggressive or bear, they're trying to
[21:12] protect something. And so when he says
[21:14] to be wise as serpents, you you're using
[21:16] wisdom and cunningness and you're
[21:18] sharpsided about your own protection.
[21:22] So there's some idea that I I I need to
[21:24] as Paul was going to be a Jew to the Jew
[21:26] and a Gentile to the Gentile and a
[21:27] heathen to the heathen that there was
[21:28] some sense that no, I'm not going to
[21:30] allow myself to be harmed in this. I I I
[21:33] want to protect myself even in the face
[21:35] of criticism and persecution. I'm not
[21:37] just going to open myself up to to a
[21:39] beating. But then he says harmless as
[21:41] doves. So that in your kindiness, you're
[21:44] free from this cunning and craftiness
[21:45] that would harm others. So you're
[21:48] sensitive to your own harms, but then
[21:50] you're also sensitive that you wouldn't
[21:51] harm others. You're avoiding traps,
[21:54] maintaining innocence. And one one
[21:57] commentator said it's this unflinching
[21:58] zeal and calm
[22:00] discretion. So you're you're intent on
[22:03] you're passionate about the word. You're
[22:05] you're you're going forth as a sheep in
[22:06] the midst of wolves. So you're going to
[22:07] be very cunning. You're going to be very
[22:08] sharp. You're going to be sharpsided.
[22:10] You're going to be very careful not to
[22:11] put yourself in a vulnerable situation,
[22:13] but you're not going to be so bold and
[22:15] hard-headed that you would harm others.
[22:18] Brother Ram takes this scripture and he
[22:20] uses it a number of places and he uh and
[22:23] and many times, but just in this
[22:24] context, I have a couple places to read
[22:26] to you, but he says in the greatest
[22:27] battle ever fought, he says, "No matter
[22:29] how wrong they are, let's not
[22:31] dysfellowship or disassociate ourselves
[22:34] with
[22:36] anything as long as we can win a soul.
[22:40] So this is that this um
[22:43] uh qualification. No matter how wrong
[22:45] they are, let's not dysfellowship or
[22:47] disassociate ourselves with anything as
[22:49] long as we can win a soul. Let's go in
[22:52] with wise as a serpent, harmless as a
[22:54] dove, and try to win every soul that we
[22:57] can. So he uses this, behold, I send you
[22:59] forth into the midst of wolves. But
[23:01] guess what? Some of those wolves are
[23:04] sheep and wolves clothing, so to speak.
[23:06] So, I'm going to send you into the midst
[23:08] of wolves, but there's other sheep.
[23:10] There's other seed. There's other people
[23:12] that can benefit from the gospel. I
[23:13] would even go so far as to say that the
[23:15] wolves could benefit from the gospel.
[23:17] Learn to be more tame and and less
[23:19] hostile and and get along with
[23:21] everybody. But he's saying that there's
[23:22] something that we can do to be wise as a
[23:24] serpent and harmless as a dove in being
[23:27] an effective labor for the gospel to win
[23:30] souls to Christ.
[23:34] when he's preaching Hebrews series in
[23:36] Hebrews chapter
[23:37] 3. This is a lengthy statement as we'll
[23:40] read it and just stick with me. I want
[23:43] to read through this. He says, "Our
[23:45] religion is not in vain. It's absolutely
[23:48] the resurrected Jesus Christ." Same
[23:50] thing. He says, "Now we must not neglect
[23:53] it." Right? There's something it's real
[23:55] to me. I know it. It's not vanity. It's
[23:57] the resurrected Christ. He says, "But we
[23:59] shouldn't neglect it." Now, just don't
[24:01] go away from church today and say,
[24:03] "Well, I kind of enjoyed going down
[24:04] there. I like the singing and the people
[24:06] are friendly around that little old
[24:07] church." Don't do that.
[24:12] Don't call this a little old church, you
[24:14] know, just a little little mission on a
[24:16] corner, whatever they might want to say.
[24:18] Said, "But and just I like the singing.
[24:19] The people are friendly." He says,
[24:20] "Don't do that, brother. Let your heart
[24:22] become a flame."
[24:25] Say, "Here, I got to do something about
[24:27] this. I got to get out and see if I can
[24:30] get somebody saved.
[24:33] So this this is it's not just that that
[24:34] was fun. That was nice. And and I don't
[24:36] believe he's just saying here that you
[24:38] should come to church and then be like,
[24:39] man, I I just want to get somebody to
[24:40] church. He said, I want somebody to know
[24:43] what it's like to have their heart on
[24:44] fire. Your heart become a flame. And
[24:47] this is I got to do something about this
[24:48] burden, this weight I feel. And then he
[24:50] cautions and don't go out saying bless
[24:52] God. If you don't repent, you're going
[24:54] to perish. No. And in one statement, he
[24:58] has ended all street corner witnessing
[25:00] that we've ever seen. Amen. Right?
[25:03] Because they all have signs that say
[25:06] you're going to hell.
[25:08] You know, not even if you can't repent
[25:09] because of what you've done already. He
[25:11] says, "No, that's not the way to do it."
[25:12] He says, "Go at it
[25:13] gentle." And all the noir maga people
[25:17] said that Jesus or that brother Brandham
[25:19] is soft, but he says, "Go at it gentle.
[25:22] Be as wise as a serpent and harmless as
[25:24] a dove." So, he goes right back to
[25:26] Matthew 10:16. He says, "See, that's the
[25:28] way to go." I hope you're listening
[25:31] listening to what I'm saying. I'm trying
[25:32] to use these things as as teaching. If
[25:34] he's raising chickens, talk about
[25:36] chickens to him for a while. Maybe God
[25:38] has allowed all our neighbors to start
[25:40] raising chickens for eggs so that we
[25:41] would know how to witness. So, how much
[25:44] are your eggs? Trader Joe's raised their
[25:45] prices. How much are you charging for
[25:47] yours? And and so, he says, "Oroach the
[25:50] person. If they're raising chickens,
[25:52] talk about chickens for a while. And
[25:54] then first thing you know, you'll be
[25:55] talking about the Lord.
[25:58] That's the other part maybe we leave
[25:59] out. We talk about chickens and LeBron
[26:00] James and everything else, but we never
[26:02] get to the Lord. If he's a farmer, talk
[26:05] about his farm. If he sells automobiles,
[26:08] talk about his automobiles for a
[26:11] while. Notice this idea that these
[26:14] aren't the categories where it's like,
[26:15] do you raise chickens? No. Okay. Do you
[26:17] do you sell automobiles? No. Do you
[26:18] farm? No. Sorry. You're not a candidate
[26:20] for the gospel. No, he's saying find
[26:22] something common ground. He says, "What
[26:25] nice cars you got, the better to race
[26:28] you with." And so forth. He says, "Till
[26:30] you catch the spirit." It says capital
[26:32] S. "What nice cars you got." And so
[26:34] forth. Till you catch the spirit. So he
[26:36] could talk to them about things. And the
[26:37] spirit here, he says, "When the father
[26:39] says, so there what you're catching is
[26:42] not necessarily theirs. You're already
[26:44] doing that through finding common
[26:45] ground." And maybe you talk to people
[26:47] said, "Do you like to fish?" No. Mm-
[26:49] don't don't like to fish. thing is
[26:50] harmful to animals. Uh, do you have a
[26:52] car? No. I believe it harms the
[26:54] environment. Do you raise chickens? No.
[26:56] That's cruelty. Do you farm? I'm kill a
[26:58] seed. No, I never did. You're like, man,
[27:00] this guy's a tough nut. Right. But he's
[27:02] saying that you once the spirit opens
[27:05] up. He says the father says now's the
[27:06] time to approach him about his soul. And
[27:09] that's a key component here. You can
[27:10] wind it off. And this, he continues the
[27:13] conversation. That's a fine automobile.
[27:15] You know, you've never said that in your
[27:16] life. Have any of you ever said that's a
[27:19] fine automobile? You will now. You know,
[27:22] transportation today has become great.
[27:24] Oh, how the nations been brought closer
[27:25] together and the cities of our nations
[27:27] close together. Friends and mothers can
[27:29] visit each other. You know, it's
[27:30] wonderful thing to have automobiles like
[27:31] you're selling. Yes, sir. It sure is.
[27:33] Uh-huh. Says, you know, puffing on a
[27:35] cigar, whatever it is. Yep. Them is good
[27:37] cars. He's just relaying. He's just
[27:39] giving you an example. Do you ever think
[27:41] of what the old-timers would have
[27:42] thought if they had seen something like
[27:43] that? Just keep going on like that. You
[27:46] know, after a while you say, "Yep, sure
[27:48] is." You know, another thing it does, it
[27:49] brings like we're having like a revive.
[27:51] It brings like in revivals. People can
[27:53] come across the country quickly for
[27:55] revival. He's just giving you a really
[27:57] good 1957 example of how that you can
[28:00] bring it around to church.
[28:02] And brother Micah can say, "You know
[28:04] what? I can actually keep working as I
[28:05] drive to church in my Tesla uh because I
[28:08] got it on autopilot." And isn't it
[28:10] great? See, you don't even have to worry
[28:11] about church driving to church. You can
[28:13] do something else. you've owned a Tesla
[28:15] and you can just use that uh to uh uh to
[28:18] drive you to church and you can keep
[28:20] working. You don't need to spend as much
[28:21] time as you used to. He's just giving
[28:22] you some example that you could contact
[28:25] their spirit. He says, "You're opening
[28:27] up the way all the time." You know,
[28:30] maybe that should be our goal more often
[28:31] when it comes to the camaraderie we have
[28:33] with professionals and other people is
[28:35] that I'm looking for an opportunity,
[28:36] Lord. I'm not just small talking. And
[28:38] I'm not just trying to get their
[28:39] attention and just enjoy some banter and
[28:42] some rap parte with a stranger, but I'm
[28:44] looking for an
[28:45] opening. He says, "You're you're opening
[28:47] up the way all the time. You know, if
[28:50] you feel something chalk up the way, he
[28:53] spelled ch C ch H O C K. So, it's
[28:55] getting chocked up. It's being clogged
[28:57] up the way. Stop right there. Move over
[28:59] here." And he says, like a doctor said
[29:01] out at Phoenix, said, "Lord, fill my
[29:03] mouth with good words and then nudge me
[29:05] when I've said enough." He repeats it.
[29:07] Nudge me when I've said enough. So our
[29:11] desire is now to when being wise as
[29:14] serpents and harmless as doves, brother
[29:15] Bram uses this at least in these two
[29:16] instances about witnessing and getting
[29:18] to know somebody. So I want to talk to
[29:20] somebody about fishing, about farming,
[29:21] about chickens, about automobiles, about
[29:23] something we can find some common ground
[29:25] or show some interest in the person and
[29:28] who they are and what they're going
[29:29] through and what their lives are like.
[29:30] And this doesn't have to
[29:32] be uh you know ambushing somebody at the
[29:35] grocery market. This could be people you
[29:36] have a normal ongoing relationship with
[29:38] or some sort of contact with, but you're
[29:40] asking all the time, "Lord, I want to Is
[29:42] it time to say something? Is there an
[29:44] opportunity?" And you're looking for
[29:46] that chance just as he said it in God's
[29:48] covenant with Abraham and his seed. You
[29:50] talk about fishing till God opens up the
[29:52] way and you get a chance to mention the
[29:54] gospel. Here, it's even less subtle.
[29:55] It's like, you know what? These cars
[29:56] have allowed us to have special meetings
[29:58] at when we have special meetings at our
[30:00] church, people come from all over.
[30:02] That's a 1957 example.
[30:05] There may be a way to where say, you
[30:07] know what, with the technology nowadays,
[30:08] isn't it amazing that you can just
[30:10] stream a service, you could catch it on
[30:12] archive or there's sermons, 1,200
[30:14] sermons of somebody that used to take up
[30:15] a whole library and you there's just
[30:17] ways that you could begin to explore an
[30:19] interest. Lord, fill my mouth with good
[30:21] words and when I've said enough, nudge
[30:23] me. He says, "Nudge me when I've said
[30:25] enough." Amen. If I could put it this
[30:27] way, I know it's kind of serving my
[30:29] title, but it is a way of relating to
[30:31] others where you are finding ways that
[30:34] you could sympathize, if not empathize
[30:36] with them. And not only you learning to
[30:39] relate to them, you they raise chickens,
[30:41] they do this, they have these hardships,
[30:43] they go through things, but you're also
[30:44] becoming relatable to them. You show an
[30:47] interest in them. You become more human
[30:48] to them. They say, "Yeah, well, this
[30:51] I've done this and I've done this. Oh,
[30:52] yeah. I used to I used to raise
[30:53] chickens. I used to sell cars or I love
[30:55] to go fishing, you become more human,
[30:56] more
[30:57] identifiable. And I would say the the
[30:59] the more that you are allowing God to
[31:02] live through you and the more you're
[31:03] yielding to Christ, the more alien
[31:06] you're going to be to the
[31:07] world. I and there's things that you
[31:10] don't do and things that you shy away
[31:11] from and ways that you might act where
[31:13] they're just like, "And this guy's just
[31:14] some sort of Autobot, like whatever. I
[31:16] don't know what he is." But then you
[31:18] become more human. You're like, "Oh,
[31:19] okay. This guy's actually he actually is
[31:22] human. He's not a religious
[31:25] android. They can identify with you. In
[31:29] first Corinthians chapter 14:1, he says,
[31:31] "Therefore," and he's talking about
[31:33] speaking in tongues, but I just want to
[31:34] use this in the context of relating to
[31:37] something. He says, "If I know not the
[31:38] meaning of the voice, I shall be unto
[31:40] him that speaketh a
[31:42] barbarian." So though the one is
[31:44] speaking, and to the one that's
[31:46] speaking, it's clear, it's articulate,
[31:48] he knows what he's saying. But the one
[31:49] that's hearing, if he doesn't know
[31:51] what's being said, the listener appears
[31:54] to be barbaric to the speaker. And he
[31:57] that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto
[31:59] me. So they're both pointing at each
[32:00] other. You
[32:02] barbarian. And a barbarian just simply
[32:04] means one who speaks a strange language
[32:06] or foreign language which is not
[32:07] understood by the hearer. So just by
[32:10] speaking in a way that cannot be
[32:12] understood or that is foreign, you look
[32:14] at the as the one by the one speaking.
[32:17] If that person is not understanding what
[32:19] you're saying, what are you going to
[32:20] begin to assume about him? You're
[32:22] speaking a language they can't
[32:24] understand. And since they don't
[32:25] understand, you're like, "Well, this
[32:26] guy's he doesn't know anything. He
[32:29] doesn't care. He's a barbarian." And
[32:30] then he's looking at you saying, "I have
[32:32] no idea what you're saying. What do you
[32:34] mean the token
[32:36] capstone pool? Seven seals. I've been to
[32:40] SeaWorld. I counted more than
[32:42] seven. When are you going to preach on
[32:44] the seven seas?"
[32:46] And there's this uh in Arizona it's the
[32:48] five C's, right? Five. Am I right? Yeah.
[32:50] So there's there's things that we could
[32:54] be saying and speaking and we become a
[32:56] barbarian.
[32:58] In Proverbs 12:18, there is that
[33:00] speaketh like the piercings of a sword.
[33:02] There's a way to speak. There's a way
[33:04] that we can talk. There's a way that we
[33:05] can share things that are damaging, that
[33:07] are hurtful, that are piercings of a
[33:09] sword. But the tongue of the wise, be
[33:10] wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
[33:12] Don't speak things that are piercing
[33:14] like a sword. You need to repent or
[33:16] perish. You're going to die. No. Go
[33:17] gentle at it because there's a way that
[33:19] you can speak that actually pierces.
[33:21] That's intentionally offensive. But the
[33:23] tongue of the wise is
[33:25] health. There's a way that you can speak
[33:27] that brings promotes healing and
[33:29] understanding where you're not a
[33:30] barbarian to them. They're like, "Well,
[33:31] this guy's using a language that I could
[33:34] understand and therefore they can hear
[33:36] you."
[33:39] In 1 Peter chapter
[33:42] 3:15 says, "But sanctify the Lord God in
[33:44] your hearts and be ready always to give
[33:46] an answer to every
[33:48] man." If I could just maybe draw on 1
[33:52] Corinthians
[33:53] 14, you need to be able to answer in a
[33:56] way that
[33:57] everyone think of it this way. Sanctify
[33:59] the Lord God in your heart. So you have
[34:01] to do that first. Sanctify your hearts
[34:03] and be ready to give an answer. Be ready
[34:04] to answer every man.
[34:09] that askketh you a reason of the hope
[34:11] that is in you with meekness and
[34:14] fear, your answer should be with
[34:17] meekness and fear.
[34:21] You're answering the question of
[34:24] hope. Therefore, what struck me as I was
[34:26] reading this last week is that to the
[34:28] one that asked, the every man that
[34:30] asked, there's some recognition of your
[34:31] hope. You're relating in some way
[34:34] through action, through abstinence, uh
[34:37] uh through some uh some some testimony
[34:40] of your life. Even if it's just your
[34:41] words or praying over food, you've
[34:43] demonstrated something to where you've
[34:45] related a hope. So, they want to ask you
[34:47] about the hope that is in you. There's
[34:49] some awareness then of your hope. And
[34:52] then at the same time, in answering
[34:53] through meekness and fear, we must have
[34:55] some sort of awareness of their
[34:57] hopelessness. That the reason they ask
[35:00] is because they want to know that hope.
[35:02] there's something even unknown to them.
[35:03] They're saying, "Well, what is it you
[35:05] believe and where is it you go to church
[35:06] and what is it you're doing?" That
[35:07] there's some asking of the hope that is
[35:10] in you.
[35:12] And to answer every man with this
[35:15] reason, our answer must be in terms that
[35:17] they can understand and relate to in
[35:20] order to give them hope.
[35:29] There's certain thing I just there's
[35:31] there's a million things that maybe pop
[35:33] in my mind,
[35:34] but like if I was told that the reason
[35:38] why you have hope is because you had to
[35:41] go
[35:42] skydiving, I have to think about that
[35:44] for a while. Okay. I kind of like being
[35:47] hopeless. Do it something you you frame
[35:50] it in a way where it's like, ah, you
[35:51] know, that's kind of a that's a tough
[35:53] hill to climb. I don't know if I can
[35:54] swallow that. That you're you're not
[35:56] wanting to offend with your
[36:00] answer. And in this I I'm I'm I'm nearly
[36:03] finished here. Very vague, but nearly
[36:07] finished. And so I I want to convey this
[36:10] that in becoming relatable or relating
[36:13] to others, we're not striving for
[36:14] ourselves to be received. I'm not being
[36:17] relatable so that I can be your buddy or
[36:19] your pal. I'm not trying to be relatable
[36:21] so that I can you can accept me into
[36:23] your click and I could be a Jew with the
[36:25] Jews and a Gentile to the Gentiles. It's
[36:27] in no way that we're doing this so that
[36:29] we can get more clout ourselves. But our
[36:31] desire is that Christ could be heard.
[36:34] Our desire is that in some way we're
[36:37] relating Christ so that he can be
[36:39] received. When somebody asks, you know,
[36:41] what's this hope that you have? I want
[36:42] to be able to answer in a way to where
[36:44] Christ becomes I'm relating Christ and
[36:46] Christ becomes relatable and even
[36:48] attainable to where they're like that's
[36:49] what I need to do. I need to recognize
[36:51] my own sins. I need to call upon the
[36:52] Lord. I I can be baptized and I feel
[36:54] this conviction or these are something
[36:56] this is something you could read. Why
[36:57] don't you come to church? There's ways
[36:59] that they say this isn't my way out of
[37:01] this sin. My way out of this darkness,
[37:03] my way to have the hope that you so
[37:05] accurately demonstrate this confidence
[37:07] you have in the Lord is I can I can do
[37:09] this through coming to know Christ
[37:11] myself
[37:15] in I was fellowshipping with uh our
[37:19] esteemed dean this morning on this
[37:23] concept but in marketing and uh
[37:26] advertising relatability is a big thing.
[37:29] I've read where it's called the X factor
[37:31] of brand success. It's a cornerstone uh
[37:35] to successful marketing.
[37:37] Relatability. And I we could get lost in
[37:40] the weeds on
[37:41] this. But relatability is the art of
[37:44] connecting with your audience.
[37:46] Relatability is the art of connecting
[37:47] with somebody on a personal level. And
[37:49] this is what social media advertising
[37:51] and marketing and SEO optimization and
[37:54] the algorithm. That's what the algorithm
[37:57] is wanting to do. It's wanting to know
[37:59] you so it can begin to relate to you so
[38:02] that it can manipulate
[38:05] you. Ominous music's playing in the
[38:09] background. I was reading where one of
[38:11] the most important skills in
[38:13] storytelling is
[38:14] relatability. Connecting with people on
[38:17] a personal level.
[38:20] That's what we're that's what I'm
[38:22] highlighting today is we are ambassadors
[38:26] for Christ. All of heaven is behind us.
[38:30] You're the image of heaven. Amen. You're
[38:32] you're you're
[38:33] you're the front of the house. You're
[38:37] the you're the curb appeal. You're what
[38:40] everyone's going to see. You're the
[38:41] pictures that God has put in his uh his
[38:44] verbbo
[38:45] listing of what heaven's going to be
[38:47] like. And could you imagine? You've all
[38:49] looked. You try to find a place to stay
[38:50] and you're like, these pictures are so
[38:51] horrible. Why would I ever stay there,
[38:55] right? And you don't want to be a
[38:56] picture of heaven. It's like, I'm going
[38:58] to have to spend eternity with that
[39:00] guy. Hell sounding sweeter every day,
[39:03] right? You don't want to be that guy.
[39:06] And you also don't want to be that guy
[39:07] that you made it look so nice and pretty
[39:10] and they follow your lead and they end
[39:12] up in hell because how many Airbnbs have
[39:13] had really, really good pictures? You're
[39:15] like, you should pay your photographer
[39:16] 10 times what you're paying them.
[39:23] We
[39:25] must we must be relatable because we are
[39:29] representatives of Christ. In 2
[39:31] Corinthians chapter 3:2 it says, "You
[39:33] are our epistle written in our heart."
[39:36] Paul has a burden on his heart. He's
[39:37] conveying this through letters. They
[39:39] read the letters. They process it. They
[39:41] assimilate the words into their hearts.
[39:42] He says, "You are this burden I have in
[39:44] my heart, but you are now written." So
[39:47] now we're being written. You're known
[39:49] and read of all men.
[39:51] Known it means to be recognized. It's to
[39:53] perceive, to be read. It's to
[39:54] distinguish between, to know accurately.
[39:56] In other words, I have a burden in my
[39:58] heart with this gospel. Now you have
[40:00] become a living epistle known and read
[40:03] of all men.
[40:06] So if you're known and read of all men,
[40:08] you catch that. That means the word is
[40:11] living in you in a way that a man can
[40:13] know what's being lived.
[40:16] known in read. It's It's not It's not so
[40:19] much that it's in a foreign language.
[40:20] It's not some sort of cipher uh uh where
[40:23] you're trying to solve who the Zodiac
[40:24] Killer is. It's something where I'm
[40:26] living the word of God that man, if he's
[40:28] hungry, can look and see and know and
[40:31] read about Christ. Amen. The word then
[40:35] live through us is this burden Paul had
[40:37] as he writes as we've received the word
[40:39] for our day. Word live becomes easy to
[40:41] relate to. Yes. To sympathize with or be
[40:44] identified
[40:46] with. It is in a way
[40:50] advertising. It is in a sense that
[40:52] marketing that Christ is doing. Now you
[40:55] have this personal intimate revelation
[40:57] of Jesus Christ. It's yours forever. You
[41:00] can't lose it. New birth cannot be
[41:02] reversed. It is a seal of God. You're uh
[41:06] you're an heir of et of the
[41:08] resurrection. You have eternal life in
[41:09] you already. That's something that you
[41:12] have. And it's it's something that is so
[41:17] supernatural. We might find in ways,
[41:18] well, how do I how can I even convey
[41:20] this? And so our prayer is Lord, I want
[41:23] to live a
[41:25] life that would make others desire you
[41:29] that could give hope.
[41:31] It's one of the things that has become a
[41:33] huge burden to me in thinking about this
[41:36] is you see so many people without hope
[41:38] and you want them to know hey
[41:41] things can be all right no matter what
[41:44] it is and I don't need to say well you I
[41:46] got three words for you William Miam
[41:48] Brandom like it's not even in the sense
[41:50] that I'm thinking that somehow coming to
[41:52] the message of the hour is going to
[41:53] solve all their problems but I want
[41:55] people to know that are in dark
[41:57] situations and terrible family
[41:58] situations and health situations and
[42:00] finances and drug addictions and all
[42:02] sorts of things. Hey, you know that
[42:04] there's there's a God. There's a gospel.
[42:06] There's a word that can deliver you.
[42:08] There's power. There's a power of God
[42:09] that can raise you up out of depression.
[42:11] There's a God that can restore you even
[42:13] from suicidal attempts. There's a God
[42:14] that can give you grace for your
[42:16] financial troubles. There's a God that
[42:18] is bigger than everything that you're
[42:19] facing. And you want to be able to
[42:21] convey that in some way. Amen. Yes. in
[42:24] the sermon, let your light so shine
[42:26] before men, brother Adams, uh, the
[42:28] subtitle, I think maybe spoken word
[42:30] publications had originally called this
[42:32] God's
[42:32] billboard. And listen to these
[42:35] statements he says, and there's some
[42:36] more that I'm leaving out. If you want
[42:37] to go back and listen to this, this is
[42:39] one I was pulling heavily from, and it,
[42:41] Lord willing, on Wednesday night, we'll
[42:43] speak about um, along these similar
[42:45] lines of relatable and uh, relevant. And
[42:49] he says the first thing that
[42:50] advertisement does and he makes the
[42:53] point he says do you realize that the
[42:55] world has capitalized on this dynamic
[42:58] and they're using it and so he takes it
[43:01] and he says now if the world uses this
[43:03] to such great success brother lawyer
[43:05] we're already working on like part 87 of
[43:07] a series on sales maybe we could do a
[43:10] SAS
[43:11] series
[43:13] the we've already had too much SAS in
[43:16] that way but cells as a service like
[43:18] there's things that we could do software
[43:19] serve. There's things that you could tie
[43:21] in in a type for all of our
[43:22] professionals here today. But it says
[43:24] the first thing the advertisement does
[43:25] the individual passing by has to see it.
[43:29] You remember his inspiration for this
[43:30] was the sign that we've probably many of
[43:31] us have seen the one word on the
[43:33] billboard with the question mark
[43:35] hungry. I remember seeing it as a kid
[43:37] driving to San Diego from Texas. Just
[43:39] one word. He says it has to be seen.
[43:41] That's why the
[43:43] placement is is in ways that it's it
[43:46] catches the eye. Now, the only way that
[43:47] the world will ever see Christ is when
[43:50] they see it in you and me. That's the
[43:52] only way they'll ever see Christ. Think
[43:54] of how the the way he's put this. Their
[43:56] conscience are so numb to the sunsets,
[43:58] to call the birds, to the leaves, to the
[44:00] grasses, and to the flowers, and to the
[44:01] music, and the message and so forth that
[44:03] we enjoy after we found Christ. This is
[44:05] so real now where everything is
[44:06] synthetic and virtual. Everything is
[44:09] inside. There's such a a loss of
[44:11] connectivity to so many different things
[44:12] and even a redefining of these things.
[44:14] There's such a numbness to where now we
[44:16] begin to relate that the world is cut
[44:17] off from God. He says, "But until we get
[44:19] to a place that we display Christ,
[44:21] remember that." He says, "Each one of
[44:24] you from tonight on remember you are
[44:27] God's billboards."
[44:29] And you are God's advertising agent.
[44:32] Hey, what do you do? I'm in advertising.
[44:35] What are you selling? Assurance, right?
[44:38] Are you God's advertising agent? He
[44:41] says, "That's what you are. You are
[44:42] God's advertising agent." the world will
[44:44] look at you and see what Christ is.
[44:47] So, we don't want to smear a big lot of
[44:49] stuff on there that testifies about
[44:51] things that we really are not.
[44:54] Something to think about, right? That's
[44:57] why the the the joke is whenever you
[44:59] see, you know, somebody in one
[45:02] uniform using the services of a a
[45:05] competitor and you're like, "Oh, well,
[45:06] you know, why is this guy from Pizza Hut
[45:08] eating over here at Chick-fil-A?"
[45:11] But he says there's uh we don't want to
[45:13] smear a big lot of stuff on there that
[45:15] testify about things that we really are
[45:16] not. Let's first be that and then when
[45:20] we be that then the world will see
[45:21] Christ will see Christ in you and me.
[45:27] You're God's billboards. Therefore, God
[45:30] wants you to be seen. He wants you to be
[45:33] his advertising agent. He wants it to be
[45:36] accurate. He wants it to be done in a
[45:37] way to where that sign that said hungry
[45:39] made you think I am in fact hungry.
[45:41] That's the whole uh modus operandi to
[45:43] all marketing is to make you think I
[45:45] need that.
[45:47] Right? As we are watching it on our
[45:50] brand new phone I need a new phone, a
[45:54] newer phone. It's the way that the world
[45:56] works. Brother Brand's making this
[45:57] parallel. Says, "Well, they've
[45:59] capitalized on it. Shouldn't we be doing
[46:01] the same thing?
[46:03] We ought to be able to answer to anyone
[46:05] who askked us of our
[46:06] hope. What is the hope of our calling?
[46:09] Why? Because we've been it's being made
[46:11] known to us as Paul prayed for the
[46:12] Ephesians church that you may understand
[46:15] what the hope of your calling is. So it
[46:17] can be related. It can be relatable. In
[46:20] Colossians 4:6, he says, "Let your
[46:23] speech be always with grace."
[46:26] such a a parallel to what is being said
[46:28] in in uh about us being in in in
[46:33] Peter in first Peter ready to give an
[46:37] answer now to the Colossians Paul in his
[46:39] way says let your speech be always with
[46:41] grace seasoned with salt that you may
[46:44] know how you ought to answer every man.
[46:47] Amen.
[46:49] Now, there's
[46:50] a a whole line of sermons that you could
[46:54] go down just to deal with salt, but salt
[46:56] preserves.
[46:58] Salt enhances flavor,
[47:00] right? We should be the salt bays of the
[47:03] message. He says, "Let your speech be
[47:05] always with grace, seasoned with salt,
[47:07] that you may know how you ought to
[47:08] answer every man." It's your speech that
[47:11] becomes seasoned with grace. It's what
[47:13] you say. It's what you're presenting.
[47:15] It's your life. It's that conversation.
[47:16] Let it be seasoned with salt. Salt so
[47:18] that you may know how to answer again
[47:20] every man.
[47:22] It speaks to being uh it's a relatable
[47:25] empathetic speech. Let your speech be
[47:27] seasoned with salt always with grace. So
[47:31] that what you're saying in some ways
[47:32] it's preserving what is said. It's
[47:34] enhancing what is
[47:36] said. Speech should have our our answer
[47:39] of our hope should have some
[47:41] attractiveness. Paul said I become
[47:43] agreeable. What was he talking about?
[47:44] acceptance to it. Now, you're not
[47:47] changing the gospel. You're you're not
[47:50] looking at somebody going, "Hey, we have
[47:52] basketball on Thursday nights,
[47:54] right? Like, that guy's tall. He'd be
[47:57] really good on my team." We're not just
[47:59] trying to find a way uh to manipulate
[48:02] and be contrived with it. But we realize
[48:05] there's there's life and death is at
[48:07] stake. And I don't want to be
[48:10] unnecessarily offensive.
[48:13] I I don't want to posture myself as
[48:15] being more revelatory and knowing this
[48:17] and and let me prove that this is wrong.
[48:19] Sometimes that's the the the worst thing
[48:21] we could do is just to kick the the
[48:23] foundation out from underneath somebody
[48:26] uh without the proper context. They're
[48:27] just thinking, "Well, you've ruined my
[48:29] paradigm, but I'm certainly not going to
[48:31] accept yours because you're the one that
[48:32] destroyed mine." I'm going to spend the
[48:35] rest of my time trying to find a way to
[48:37] destroy yours. And it creates a very
[48:39] negative dynamic. So you're thinking in
[48:41] a way of Lord, I want to be an effective
[48:43] witness. I want to be able to relate to
[48:45] what they're going through. I want to be
[48:46] able to speak in a way to where it
[48:48] preserves the truth of the gospel, but
[48:50] it also enhances it in a way that it's
[48:53] attractive and there's some sort of
[48:54] desire that they would have. Maybe I
[48:57] could put it this way. Learn how to read
[48:58] the room, right? And know your audience.
[49:03] And to do that, you have to humble
[49:05] yourself and not make it all about you.
[49:08] make it all about your church or making
[49:09] it all about proving something's right,
[49:10] but recognizing there's life and death
[49:12] at stake. And how can I talk this person
[49:16] down from this death trap that they're
[49:19] in? Get them to see that there's a
[49:21] loving God who could rescue them from
[49:23] this darkness.
[49:25] Brother Random in the sermon, let your
[49:26] light so shine before men. Again, this
[49:28] is from God's billboards. You see the
[49:31] paragraph number there. He says the
[49:32] first thing we we're reading in another
[49:34] place says the first thing that any
[49:36] advertisement with any advertisement the
[49:38] person has to see it. So we'd already
[49:39] read it previously where he said the
[49:41] world has to first see it. The
[49:42] individual has to see it and that's the
[49:44] only way that Christ can ever be seen.
[49:45] He says the next thing they have to want
[49:48] it right
[49:50] they have to want it. Amen. That that
[49:53] means that when you advertise, you don't
[49:55] advertise the worst steak ever unless
[49:59] you reference the Yelp user who left the
[50:01] review. There's a way that you you're
[50:03] not going to advertise and say, you know
[50:04] what, our food comes from Cisco. You can
[50:06] get the same thing two blocks down.
[50:08] There's there's a way that you it's
[50:11] advertised that you make them want it.
[50:13] And this is just basic marketing 101,
[50:16] but he says they have to want it. Now,
[50:17] if they see it and don't want it, then
[50:19] that's different. But you haven't put a
[50:21] vain advertisement out. He says, "But if
[50:24] they have first have got to see it and
[50:26] then we've got to make it so attractive
[50:29] to them." Oh, I love if anybody thought
[50:32] I was out on a ledge and talking about
[50:34] making it attractive or enhancing the
[50:35] flavor. I'm just getting this from the
[50:36] message. We've got to make it attractive
[50:39] to them. Are we watering it down? Are we
[50:41] dressing it up? No. We're using wise as
[50:44] serpents. Homos says, "Oh, I hope you
[50:46] see that the attractiveness of
[50:48] salvation. what it does to the person.
[50:50] We've got to attract the world to
[50:52] Christ. And the gospel does have an
[50:54] attractiveness.
[50:56] Maybe that's what we need to pray for is
[50:57] more revelation of the attractiveness of
[50:59] the gospel. Lord, let me take this
[51:01] gospel and learn it. Brother Bam uses
[51:03] the example of how the the lamps when
[51:05] there was a contest, he just gave them
[51:07] all away. People used them and they were
[51:09] nice and he sold them. He said he won
[51:10] the contest. Why? The product spoke for
[51:12] itself. And maybe we need to learn more
[51:15] about the word of God, learn more about
[51:16] what it does and become more in love
[51:18] with it to where it's like it almost
[51:19] becomes instinctive. Not many people
[51:22] know me for very long without they know
[51:24] what kind of socks I
[51:26] wear. Where is this going? Well, I
[51:29] really like Marina wool
[51:32] socks and and a big believer in their
[51:35] durability and the fact that they don't
[51:36] smell. And I've told people, I'll buy
[51:38] you a pair of marina wool socks, work
[51:40] boot socks. you can wear them for a
[51:41] month and don't wash them and you could
[51:42] take them off fresh and sweaty and hand
[51:44] them to me and I'll and I'll smell them
[51:47] and I said if you don't like them I'll
[51:49] buy them I'll buy them back from you or
[51:50] I bought them for them. I said if you
[51:51] don't like them I'll pay you to get them
[51:53] back. And so there's things that we're
[51:55] passionate about in life, right? You
[51:58] know you know like people who use
[52:00] Android, you know how don't you don't
[52:02] have to ask, they'll tell you, right?
[52:03] There's just things that you know and
[52:05] they're going to let you know and
[52:05] they're going to declare it to you
[52:06] because they're passionate about it and
[52:07] they love it and there's a sense and a
[52:09] feeling they have and they're
[52:10] evangelists for it and they're going to
[52:12] share their enthusiasm for it. Maybe
[52:14] that's what we need to do is just dig a
[52:15] little bit more into the word of God and
[52:17] find how useful it is, how applicable it
[52:18] is, fall more in love with it to where
[52:20] we can say, "Hey,
[52:22] this is the attractiveness of the
[52:25] gospel."
[52:26] He says the gospel does have an
[52:27] attractiveness. It has to it has it to
[52:30] those who are hungering for God. I love
[52:33] the the caveat of the qualification that
[52:35] you're you're not just going to get
[52:36] anybody to want it. Amen. But if they're
[52:39] hungry, it only attracts those who are
[52:40] hungry and thirsting, and that's the
[52:42] ones we are out for.
[52:45] So, we're we have we're intentional
[52:47] about making the gospel attractive for
[52:49] those that need it, that want it. No man
[52:51] can come to me except my father draws
[52:53] him. But there's so many that the
[52:55] father's drawn and are hungering and
[52:56] thirsting to find God. And they don't
[52:58] know where to find him. Amen. Because
[53:01] those who are supposed to be billboards
[53:03] are so smutted up with the things of the
[53:05] world till they can't see where they've
[53:07] got anymore that they've got before they
[53:11] till they can't see where they've got
[53:13] anymore than they got before they come
[53:16] to him. You see what he's saying? They
[53:19] can't they're not seeing the difference.
[53:20] They don't see the
[53:22] distinction. They live like the world.
[53:24] They talk like the world. They sing the
[53:25] same songs the world does. They dress
[53:27] like the world.
[53:29] He says, 'I mean especially the female
[53:31] sex and they act like the world and they
[53:33] go to worldly places. They attend the
[53:35] worldly
[53:37] entertainments. There's no difference.
[53:39] There's no distinguishing.
[53:41] There's no life lived by the word that
[53:42] declares the difference that's being
[53:44] made.
[53:50] We ought to know how to answer every man
[53:52] with the speech that is with grace
[53:55] seasoned with salt in order to attract
[53:58] those who are
[53:59] hungry. That's my that's my idea that
[54:03] you say that's what my my desire is in
[54:05] living the word. And if I ever speak
[54:06] about it, if I I ever feel that
[54:08] uncction, I'm not just trying to impress
[54:09] somebody with what I know, but I'm
[54:11] sharing this just to see that if there's
[54:12] a hunger there, it could provoke
[54:15] something and lead them to something. I
[54:17] feel that that uh that opening up that
[54:19] channel to bring home the gospel. I'm
[54:21] sensitive to those opportunities
[54:23] because I need to find those that are
[54:25] hungry. So therefore, I want to be able
[54:26] to know my word well enough that it's I
[54:29] can relate to it and it can be related
[54:32] in a way that can be attractive to the
[54:33] one who wants it.
[54:36] They want it. They actually want what
[54:40] you
[54:41] have. And it's it should be an easy
[54:44] sale.
[54:46] So what gets in the way? He says it's
[54:47] the mixed messages that we send.
[54:50] It's the fact that we're trying to sell
[54:52] them on peace and we're just so ranting
[54:55] raven mad about Kla Harris.
[54:58] Like I don't know that you got peace
[55:00] there, pal.
[55:03] But the Bible says in Matthew 5 13 to
[55:05] 16, ye are the salt of the earth. I
[55:07] believe we begin this line of ministry
[55:09] on witnessing with these scriptures. Ye
[55:10] are the salt of the earth. But if the
[55:12] salt has lost its savor, wherewith shall
[55:14] it be salted? You are the salt of the
[55:17] earth. You should have wore your shirt,
[55:18] brother Philip. Salt and light. You are
[55:20] the salt of the earth. But if the salt
[55:21] has lost its savor, wherewith shall it
[55:22] be salted? What? What in in the earth?
[55:26] What in the world is going to enhance
[55:27] and
[55:28] preserve? It is thenforth good for
[55:30] nothing but to be cast out and to be
[55:31] trodden under the foot of men. It's lost
[55:34] its quality that makes it valuable.
[55:37] becomes no different than dirt if it
[55:40] loses its power and its
[55:43] effectiveness. Then he says, "You are
[55:45] the light of the world." The seed that
[55:47] is said on the hill cannot be hid.
[55:48] There's so much we're just uh glossing
[55:50] over in a way that it's this rich,
[55:52] beautiful picture that's painted. You
[55:54] are the light of the world. Musicians,
[55:56] you could come to your instruments. A
[55:57] city that is set on the hill cannot be
[55:59] hid. Neither do men light a candle and
[56:01] put under a bushel, but on a
[56:02] candlestick, and it giveth light unto
[56:04] all that are in the house. Let your
[56:06] light so shine before men that they may
[56:09] see your good works and glorify your
[56:11] father which is in heaven. This is God's
[56:14] billboard. This is a this is a call uh
[56:17] to be God's advertising agent. I have a
[56:20] responsibility to the word which has
[56:22] redeemed me. I have a responsibility to
[56:23] the Christ that has saved me. I have a
[56:25] responsibility to Christ that has not
[56:26] only healed my body but saved my soul.
[56:28] Responsibility to Christ who's given me
[56:29] this peace that I have, this discipline
[56:31] I have in the word. This one that
[56:33] rescues me from all my mistakes. the one
[56:34] that is patient with me when I've sinned
[56:36] and I've made mistakes and I've gotten
[56:38] cold and I've done this and I've done
[56:39] that and I've gotten and this Christ
[56:40] who's been patient, persevering, his
[56:42] love's never given up on us. He's stayed
[56:44] with us through all these years, decades
[56:46] of serving God and we make terrible
[56:47] mistakes and we do things we shouldn't
[56:49] do. God hasn't written us off. He's
[56:50] still right there loving us and receive
[56:52] us. I have a responsibility out of love.
[56:54] I have a love duty to him. I'm a
[56:57] prisoner of God to where I want to be
[56:59] his witness. Amen.
[57:03] I want to make the gospel attractive not
[57:06] to the world.
[57:10] But to the one in the world that wants
[57:11] it. Amen. I'm not I can't I'm not going
[57:14] to I God help me that I don't get so
[57:18] blinded by certain things I in in in
[57:22] elements to where I I I I just I want to
[57:26] please and I and I want people to be
[57:27] happy and and watered down the Bible to
[57:31] where then we could just say, "Well,
[57:32] it's really just an allegory. Things
[57:34] didn't literally happen this way and
[57:36] this person didn't really exist." this,
[57:37] but we're extrapolating from it these
[57:39] principles and these teachings. And
[57:41] really, it's it is a work of man and and
[57:44] there really is no God or Jesus Christ.
[57:46] But there's there's really not a better
[57:48] way to live,
[57:49] people. And turn it into a philosophy.
[57:53] No, they think it's only the realities
[57:54] of it. It's only understanding the
[57:57] realities of it and the truth and the
[57:59] absolute of it that's ever going to make
[58:00] you an effective advertising agent.
[58:03] Because you do realize we're not just
[58:04] adopting a better practices. This is
[58:07] life or death if it has been in fact
[58:09] made real to me and I know it. I want to
[58:12] be that salt,
[58:15] a drawing agent. I want to be that one
[58:17] that attracts. I want to be a city set
[58:18] on the hill. I want to be positionally
[58:20] placed as a candle in a dark room. And I
[58:24] want my light now ye are light in the
[58:26] Lord. I want my light to
[58:29] shine that others who are hungering and
[58:31] thirsting for
[58:32] God could by my witness and my testimony
[58:35] turn to him and glorify God for his
[58:38] great
[58:39] salvation. Add another candlestick to
[58:41] the lampstand. Place another city on the
[58:44] hill. Add a little bit more
[58:47] [Music]
[58:48] salt. Brother Benham says this. He says,
[58:51] "We are
[58:52] not his salesmen.
[58:55] [Music]
[58:56] making this point. We're not his
[58:58] salesman. We are his
[59:01] billboards. Don't think we are his
[59:03] salesman. He don't need any
[59:05] salesmanship, just
[59:08] billboards. It's the salesmanship that's
[59:10] got us in trouble because a lot of
[59:12] ministers think they're working on
[59:14] commission. They want their name at the
[59:16] top of the board, right? They're
[59:18] comparing how many uh walkers they've
[59:21] thrown away or crutches they got stored
[59:23] up somewhere, right? They're they're
[59:25] looking at the optics of things and
[59:27] there's they're measuring things and it
[59:29] it's
[59:30] [Music]
[59:33] self-promotion. Says we are his
[59:34] billboards, not
[59:36] salesman. All
[59:37] right. I'm just a canvas,
[59:41] Lord. Advertise you. I I I don't even
[59:44] need to talk. I don't need to speak. Let
[59:45] me be that lamp, Lord, that you can
[59:46] place in a dark place. Let me be that
[59:49] lamp that you can get that you can shed
[59:51] abroad into the world. And others would
[59:52] say, "I want that. I want what you have.
[59:56] I I'm going to be honest. Is it making
[59:57] sense to to us? Do you understand what
[1:00:00] my burden is? I I I know I'm not
[1:00:02] sweating as much as maybe you want your
[1:00:03] preacher to, but my heart is enthused
[1:00:07] for this gospel. It's very, very real
[1:00:10] and it's relevant to the time we're
[1:00:11] living in. Though it might seem to be
[1:00:13] antiquated some of the examples of
[1:00:15] farmers and automobiles and revival
[1:00:17] meetings, but it's living in you now,
[1:00:19] updated, but the same yesterday, today,
[1:00:21] and forever. The same Christ living in
[1:00:24] flesh today. And we are his billboards.
[1:00:26] Don't try to be a salesman. I promise
[1:00:28] you that if God was if I was tasked to
[1:00:34] providing for my family through sales,
[1:00:35] we would
[1:00:36] starve. I'm not a salesman. I can hardly
[1:00:40] return, you know, send back a steak to
[1:00:42] the kitchen that I'm paying $50 for.
[1:00:44] Sales, I pick up a phone call and call.
[1:00:46] I got phone anxiety, social anxiety. I
[1:00:48] don't answer the phone. I started a law
[1:00:50] practice and I hated answering phones.
[1:00:52] It's like, what? You're never going to
[1:00:54] be successful. All your clients just
[1:00:56] goes to voicemail. I loved it when they
[1:00:57] started transcribing voicemails. It's
[1:00:59] like, I don't even have to listen to
[1:01:00] voicemail now. I can just read it. I I'm
[1:01:03] not a
[1:01:04] salesman. I I I've never been good at
[1:01:06] it. There's a lot of things I ask my
[1:01:07] wife to do because I think she's better
[1:01:09] at it. I'm like, "Honey, can you call
[1:01:10] them and see if we can get this to comp?
[1:01:11] Can you do this?" Because I just if I
[1:01:13] ask somebody say, "Can we do this?" No.
[1:01:14] I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry I even bothered
[1:01:16] you. I'm not a salesman. So, I'm glad
[1:01:20] that I'm not having to be a salesman.
[1:01:22] Listen, there's a grace that's
[1:01:23] ministered in this. You're not trying to
[1:01:25] sell somebody. You don't have the the
[1:01:26] clothes or whatever. You're not trying
[1:01:28] to look for that special hook or the
[1:01:30] sizzle. And you know, like if you if you
[1:01:32] give your heart to God now, we'll throw
[1:01:33] in a new
[1:01:34] iPhone, right? You're you're not trying
[1:01:36] to you spice up. You're just a
[1:01:38] billboard.
[1:01:39] Your life is an advertisement. I know
[1:01:42] the peace that God gives.
[1:01:44] I know the grace that God gives. And how
[1:01:47] how are we going to how how are we going
[1:01:48] to advertise it? By giving it. By
[1:01:50] showing it. By living it. God, help us
[1:01:51] to do that. To be relatable.
[1:01:55] God, help us. Let's
[1:01:57] stand. So much more to be explored in
[1:02:01] this. Lord willing, we'll speak on being
[1:02:03] relevant.
[1:02:05] uh a lot of things the
[1:02:09] relationship that God in flesh needs to
[1:02:12] be relevant
[1:02:16] uh for the want the need that a person
[1:02:18] has so many things that we could look at
[1:02:20] do you want to be a witness
[1:02:23] you want to testify of the good things
[1:02:24] that God's doing in this day that we're
[1:02:25] living in that he's doing in your family
[1:02:27] doing in your life say Lord help me I
[1:02:28] don't want to just I don't want to be I
[1:02:30] don't want salesmanship I'm not trying
[1:02:32] to outdo anybody not trying to get a
[1:02:34] greater commission Lord I just want to
[1:02:35] be your witness. I want to be your
[1:02:37] servant. God, make me a billboard. Those
[1:02:40] themes of billboards, ambassadors, a a
[1:02:43] signpost, that's what we are. Let's
[1:02:45] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank
[1:02:48] you for just the
[1:02:50] comfortable presence that you brought
[1:02:52] today, a settling. Lord, I appreciate
[1:02:54] the opportunity as a pastor just to be
[1:02:55] able to speak to the people in a way
[1:02:58] that is
[1:03:00] uh personable.
[1:03:03] Lord, in doing so, I would never want uh
[1:03:05] to send mixed signals or be casual about
[1:03:07] the gospel,
[1:03:08] [Music]
[1:03:12] but maybe unintentionally, Lord,
[1:03:16] there's there's a desire to be
[1:03:19] relatable, to make the material plain
[1:03:23] known and read.
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] Lord, I just even hearing the testimony
[1:03:31] of how Gabriel Donaldson enjoyed the
[1:03:33] service Wednesday
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:39] night. Lord, those things are that's
[1:03:42] encouraging to know that the word is
[1:03:44] reaching all
[1:03:47] ages. It's catching attention. It's it's
[1:03:50] becoming applicable.
[1:03:53] Lord, I pray for myself, for my family,
[1:03:55] my wife and I, my children, that we
[1:03:56] could even as we
[1:04:00] travel, make the gospel
[1:04:03] attractive in the way that we handle
[1:04:05] disgruntled travelers, the way that we
[1:04:06] handle rude desk agents, and the way
[1:04:09] that we respond to difficulties and
[1:04:11] crisis. Lord, may we just demonstrate a
[1:04:14] peace that passeth understanding.
[1:04:18] May we be those rocks in times of
[1:04:21] trouble where we could say, "Hold hold
[1:04:24] steady. There's a God that's with us."
[1:04:29] Lord, may we as a church
[1:04:32] be a
[1:04:34] billboard where there's salvation and
[1:04:37] healing and we're not just paying lip
[1:04:39] service to your presence, but Lord, we
[1:04:41] have received. Welcome and received your
[1:04:44] word and you're
[1:04:46] here. You've
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:51] come, but now is you are now here
[1:04:54] present with us.
[1:04:56] May we be accurate reflections of that
[1:04:59] presence, Lord, in our
[1:05:01] homes, on our jobs. Lord, I I I see room
[1:05:05] in this church for new
[1:05:07] souls. I want to use that baptism, oh
[1:05:09] Lord, not only for our children, but for
[1:05:11] the
[1:05:13] lost. And may our hearts be open to
[1:05:16] you that we can be discerning as we
[1:05:20] interact with people. Not that we give
[1:05:22] ourselves over to worldliness, but we
[1:05:24] can become
[1:05:25] relatable. But Lord, help us to be more
[1:05:28] sensitive for that opportunity to turn
[1:05:30] it to you so that it doesn't just become
[1:05:32] too much world.

[1:05:37] Lord, maybe if we are talking about
[1:05:38] LeBron James, we could talk about why
[1:05:40] his nickname is King James and it turns
[1:05:42] to the Bible. There's ways that we know
[1:05:45] we could do it. Lord, help us to be
[1:05:47] better witnesses. We love you. We commit
[1:05:49] ourselves to you today in the worship
[1:05:51] and the post that you would just be
[1:05:52] present with us. We love you and we ask
[1:05:54] this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:05:56] Amen.
