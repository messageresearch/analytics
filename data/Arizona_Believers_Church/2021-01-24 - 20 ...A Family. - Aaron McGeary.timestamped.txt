[0:00] our gracious heavenly father we're so uh
[0:02] uplifted today by the worship
[0:05] lord we're encouraged by your presence
[0:08] that is with us
[0:09] and lord we pray that as you have been
[0:12] faithful to
[0:13] inhabit these praises to honor your word
[0:16] that where two or three are gathered in
[0:18] your name you are in our midst
[0:20] we ask now father that you would come
[0:21] and break the bread of life to us
[0:24] lord if we were to pull each heart we
[0:27] could give different reasons as to why
[0:28] we're here
[0:30] different paths to get here different
[0:32] experiences that have brought us to this
[0:34] place
[0:35] we could even have different
[0:36] expectations this morning
[0:38] different prayers different hurts and
[0:41] different wants
[0:42] but lord the reality is at the end of
[0:45] the day
[0:46] at the end of the analysis once all the
[0:48] polling is done and all the questions
[0:50] are asked and all the pathways
[0:52] are examined all the needs and wants are
[0:55] placed before you
[0:57] the reality is father it all meets in
[0:59] you
[1:01] lord everything that we have need of is
[1:03] in you
[1:04] everything that we desire is only
[1:06] satisfied in you

[1:10] this place
[1:10] experiences needs and wants and desires
[1:13] that have led to this moment
[1:15] it's led to you so now father with this
[1:19] understanding that the supernatural sets
[1:21] before us we humble ourselves
[1:23] to hear from you we ask that you take
[1:25] control of this service for your glory

[1:40] but also father realizing that
[1:43] you could have a very specific message
[1:45] for one person
[1:46] and if it were to lighten the load or to
[1:48] deliver strength and encourage
[1:50] save a soul lord it's worth every effort
[1:53] so father we surrender ourselves to you
[1:55] now praying that you take control of
[1:56] this service for your glory
[1:58] we praise your name we bless you bless
[1:59] your people father in the name of the
[2:01] lord jesus christ
[2:02] amen amen if you could take your bibles
[2:05] and
[2:06] turn to genesis chapter 2. we're going
[2:09] to read
[2:09] one verse there genesis chapter 2 verse
[2:20] 18.
[2:31] genesis chapter 2 verse 18.
[2:36] and it says
[2:40] and the lord god said it is not good
[2:43] that the man should be alone i will make
[2:46] him
[2:47] a help meet for him so short i'd like
[2:50] just to read it again this is
[2:51] my emphasis or my inspiration is uh
[2:54] solely from this verse and the lord god
[2:56] said it is not
[2:58] good that the man should be alone i will
[3:00] make him
[3:01] a help meet for him amen you may be
[3:03] seated
[3:07] i'll give the the disclaimer right off
[3:09] the bat this is going to be very very
[3:11] simple
[3:12] and very focused and
[3:15] i was extremely directed to this
[3:19] particular subject and i feel that
[3:22] i couldn't get away from it so i wanted
[3:23] just to approach it
[3:25] and as i thought about it in my heart in
[3:27] terms of what the
[3:29] the emphasis was from the spirit or what
[3:31] the lord was dealing with me in my heart
[3:32] what my burden was i felt that
[3:34] it certainly at the very minimum it
[3:36] should encourage us or inspire us to
[3:38] greater brotherly kindness
[3:40] and to have a deeper empathy for others
[3:43] being able to relate to them and
[3:44] understand
[3:45] how god has made man and the different
[3:47] circumstances one might be in
[3:50] and also i believe it would be a comfort
[3:53] and an encouragement or health to those
[3:54] who are searching for healing
[3:56] maybe a sense of belonging or just even
[3:58] understand themselves and how that
[3:59] there's a need deep within man that god
[4:01] wants to meet
[4:03] and uh sometimes we're not even mindful
[4:04] of the forces that drive us
[4:06] or the things that influence us and so i
[4:08] want to be very focused and very
[4:10] specific today
[4:11] yet very simple on the subject
[4:14] still continue on the family but the
[4:16] subject that the lord's been dealing
[4:17] with me
[4:18] on this past week was loneliness and if
[4:20] you just want to look
[4:21] at verse 18 again it says in the lord
[4:23] god said
[4:25] it is not good that the man should be
[4:28] alone
[4:28] i will make him a help meet for him and
[4:31] so we've looked at how
[4:33] already how a picture of god is
[4:34] unfolding in the beginning god created
[4:37] and we've arrived to this expression of
[4:39] a family
[4:40] and this was god's the momentum of god
[4:43] from the beginning was leading to this
[4:45] particular expression
[4:47] and this expression of male and female
[4:49] the expression of man and woman
[4:51] the embodiment of husband and wife and
[4:53] the family
[4:54] were an expression of god so it was
[4:56] actually god's desire and even the
[4:58] person of god
[4:59] that was being expressed in this image
[5:01] we see of the masterpiece family and
[5:03] adam and the woman
[5:05] but i want to look at this statement uh
[5:07] it's kind of taking a step back before
[5:09] this
[5:10] expression further unfolds he says it is
[5:12] not good
[5:13] that the man should be alone this is a
[5:16] very
[5:16] striking statement as god actually
[5:18] vocalizes his sentiment
[5:20] god is giving his opinion or his
[5:22] judgment about something
[5:24] we look back through the scripture and
[5:25] we see that god to this point had spoken
[5:28] to create
[5:29] he had spoken to bless or to command and
[5:32] the scripture expresses that god
[5:33] saw that it was good so it was giving us
[5:36] insight to god's sentiment
[5:37] and so god would speak and something
[5:39] would be or god would bless or command
[5:41] and it would be so
[5:42] or that would be a blessing upon the
[5:44] creation and then it said god saw that
[5:47] it was good so it gives us insight to
[5:48] what god is thinking what his opinion
[5:50] and judgment is
[5:51] but here god declares something
[5:54] and it's the first declarative statement
[5:57] if i could use it that way
[5:58] that discloses how he's feeling or what
[6:00] he's thinking
[6:01] or his opinion or judgment of creation
[6:04] and
[6:05] it's not uh it's not rosy or flowery as
[6:07] you might think
[6:08] this is great attaboy everything's
[6:10] looking wonderful but he says
[6:11] it is not good that man should be alone
[6:14] so first time god speaks
[6:16] in terms of not commanding not blessing
[6:19] not creating but god is just speaking
[6:21] his sentiment or his judgment about his
[6:23] creation and it is it is not good that
[6:25] man
[6:25] should be alone that means i thought it
[6:27] was interesting that the hebrew word is
[6:29] bad
[6:30] it is not good that man should be bad
[6:32] and so it's bad to be alone in other
[6:34] words is what god was saying
[6:35] but it means to be by itself or to be
[6:37] besides to be separate from
[6:39] and it comes from the root to withdrawal
[6:41] to separate or to be isolated
[6:44] and so god looks at man and he
[6:47] identifies
[6:48] he expresses this sentiment this is not
[6:50] good for man to be alone
[6:52] and it's the feeling of being forsaken
[6:55] it's the feeling of feeling
[6:57] it's a feeling of missing out or feeling
[6:58] like you don't belong you don't fit in
[7:00] and
[7:01] and seeing something something expressed
[7:03] or something identified and you yourself
[7:05] not having the same
[7:07] companionship or the same camaraderie or
[7:09] fellowship
[7:10] and god places this of this expression
[7:14] it is not good for man to be alone
[7:16] in verses 19 and 20 it says in the lord
[7:18] god command
[7:19] cause to grow out of the ground all the
[7:21] beasts of the field and and adam was
[7:22] commissioned to go and name all the
[7:24] beasts and all the cattle and all the
[7:26] fowls of the air
[7:27] and it says at the end of verse 20 is
[7:29] adam was naming everything it says and
[7:31] there was
[7:31] not found a help meet for him now this
[7:35] this what we would have seen is adam
[7:36] would have named all the animals and
[7:38] named all creatures
[7:39] he would have seen male female male
[7:41] female he would have seen that there was
[7:42] companionship there was multiples
[7:44] of these creation it wasn't just
[7:46] singular it wasn't just one
[7:47] so adam would have even would have been
[7:51] been viewed differently than the rest of
[7:52] creation and perhaps himself maybe he
[7:54] was feeling like
[7:55] hey wait a minute everybody else has got
[7:58] a friend
[7:59] everybody else has got a crew i'm the
[8:01] only one
[8:02] you know i don't have anybody to hang
[8:03] out with i don't have anybody who's like
[8:05] me i don't have
[8:06] he saw something expressed in creation
[8:08] that he himself would have felt
[8:09] a loneliness and emptiness maybe
[8:12] something a feeling of being forsaken
[8:14] and so god looks at it and he expresses
[8:16] the same sentiment
[8:17] not because he's kind of guessing what
[8:19] adam felt but he's empathetic
[8:21] because god is the lonely god dwelt
[8:23] alone dwelt by himself no contemporary
[8:25] no equal none
[8:26] that would that could enter into
[8:28] fellowship and harmony with god
[8:30] completely
[8:31] and so loneliness is the first thing
[8:33] that god declares
[8:34] is not good and if you look at verse 17
[8:37] how it says
[8:38] it speaks of eating of the tree of
[8:39] knowledge of good and evil it says the
[8:41] day that you eat it
[8:42] that day you'll die it suggests that
[8:44] loneliness is second only to death
[8:47] uh because he says hey if you eat this
[8:49] you're gonna die and it's not good for
[8:50] man to be alone it creates maybe a
[8:52] hierarchy of the worst things one
[8:54] to die number two to be alone and maybe
[8:56] the worst would be to die alone
[8:59] but he's expressing these things and i
[9:01] think it's just very
[9:02] uh it was very striking to me
[9:08] there's there's different levels that we
[9:09] could express it in and i want to
[9:11] be very specific as i said the man could
[9:14] not be alone or should not be alone in
[9:16] order to fulfill the commandment he was
[9:18] under
[9:19] in order to be fruitful and multiply
[9:20] there had to be female there had to be
[9:22] an expression of this gender
[9:23] in order for him to fulfill his
[9:25] commission to bring forth to be fruitful
[9:27] multiply
[9:28] and then also to replenish and subdue
[9:30] the earth it was something that would be
[9:32] done together as a family as a couple as
[9:34] husband and wife but there's more that's
[9:36] meant in god's conviction
[9:38] of a man's need and necessity for
[9:40] companionship it's not well man can't
[9:42] get the job done without the woman
[9:44] but it spoke deeply to something about
[9:46] the man
[9:47] when he says it is not good for man to
[9:49] be alone it's not good for man to be
[9:51] only himself
[9:53] and since it's not good for men to be
[9:54] only himself i will make a counterpart
[9:56] of himself
[9:58] i will make a help like himself and and
[10:01] i want to get into more
[10:02] of what this word help me means but
[10:04] before exploring who this help me is
[10:06] this one
[10:07] who is like him to help him i want to
[10:09] consider the premise upon which god
[10:11] bases
[10:12] the expression of the woman in other
[10:15] words god just does not say and he
[10:16] caused adam to go into a deep sleep and
[10:18] he took out
[10:19] took a rib and he he brought forth a
[10:21] woman made he a woman and closed up the
[10:22] flesh thereof
[10:24] and brought the woman unto the man he
[10:25] says that he gives this expression
[10:27] this utterance before he does it so it's
[10:29] the very premise it's part of his
[10:31] inspiration
[10:32] it's part of his reasoning and as to why
[10:33] man needs the woman he says it is not
[10:36] good for men to be alone
[10:37] so i will make him to help me so i don't
[10:39] i want to look at that foundation of
[10:41] that premise even god's justification
[10:43] for creating the woman because god
[10:45] reveals something about our nature as
[10:47] humans
[10:48] we say well that was true about adam in
[10:50] genesis chapter two well it's still true
[10:52] about man today
[10:54] and so not only is he revealing
[10:55] something about our nature as
[10:57] all nature as humans but he's showing us
[10:59] his divine nature
[11:01] it was something that god could relate
[11:02] to it's something that god uh
[11:05] shared an affinity with adam in that
[11:06] regards so it speaks about something
[11:08] in god's divine nature but also his
[11:10] desire for us
[11:12] uh um it wasn't god just remarking look
[11:15] at that guy he's all alone but it was
[11:17] god saying i know
[11:18] this is not good i know how he feels
[11:20] there's something about the man and the
[11:21] way that i made him
[11:23] and and so god can relate to that so it
[11:25] reveals something about god and it also
[11:27] shows that god has a desire for us to
[11:29] meet the needs that we have
[11:32] and in a simple way we can say that god
[11:35] created the man as a social creature
[11:38] more than any of the other animals even
[11:39] though we would see that a serpent was
[11:42] an upright beast that could talk
[11:44] he created the man to be a social
[11:46] creature
[11:47] and i want to make some of these
[11:48] statements in the beginning though i
[11:50] i could see how they might be more
[11:52] appropriate at the end
[11:54] but the full the full maturity of adam
[11:56] the full expression of who he was and
[11:58] all that he could be
[11:59] required help required companionship
[12:02] it was it was necessary that the woman
[12:04] come forth
[12:05] and this is true of adam and it holds
[12:07] true today our full character
[12:10] uh the potential that we have within us
[12:12] cannot be developed just by solo labor
[12:15] you can't just go at it alone you can't
[12:17] just do it by yourself you can't you're
[12:18] not just set off on your own
[12:19] and being by yourself and being alone
[12:21] and doing all on your there's no way
[12:23] that the full potential
[12:24] of your being the everything that you're
[12:26] to accomplish and even your full
[12:27] character cannot be developed
[12:28] by just working by yourself
[12:32] and and i don't mean just being
[12:33] self-employed or being a solo
[12:34] practitioner
[12:36] but anybody who is who's in a trade
[12:37] where they work by themselves really
[12:39] there's an upside to it and there's a
[12:40] downside to it
[12:42] being a solo practitioner you you don't
[12:44] have the the um the exchange
[12:46] and the counseling and the the checks
[12:48] and balances and so there's an upside to
[12:50] those things there's a downside
[12:52] to it but i'm looking about in life in
[12:54] life and who you are and who god wants
[12:56] you to be and the fullness
[12:58] of your potential and your full
[12:59] character cannot be developed just
[13:00] working on your own or going at it alone
[13:04] because we we realize that solitude is
[13:07] important to an individual prayer
[13:08] meditation getting alone
[13:10] but we cannot correctly grow in mere
[13:12] solitude
[13:14] and i mean i think you could probably
[13:16] get some real hearty amens at this
[13:17] thought loneliness
[13:19] cannot produce a full life
[13:22] loneliness cannot cannot produce proper
[13:25] service what we're called to do
[13:27] and so i would place it in this context
[13:30] as we're examining the subject of it is
[13:32] not good for man to be alone
[13:34] the perfection of our character requires
[13:36] the responsibilities
[13:38] as a family member responsibilities we
[13:40] have as a family member the perfection
[13:42] of our character
[13:43] required this responsibility that is
[13:45] borne by the fact that you are a son or
[13:47] a daughter
[13:48] perfection of our character requires the
[13:50] responsibilities that you hold as a
[13:52] spouse or as a parent
[13:53] and is through those relationships that
[13:55] our character is perfected
[13:57] and so we're the perfection of our
[13:58] character is impossible without
[14:00] friendships
[14:02] it's impossible without without the
[14:04] relationship as an employer or employee
[14:06] or
[14:06] or neighbor or a citizen all those
[14:08] relationships that we share with others
[14:10] between people or among people
[14:12] are necessary for the perfection of our
[14:14] character be
[14:16] very very difficult to make the argument
[14:18] that a man had perfect character
[14:20] and he loved his wife and was upright
[14:22] but he was a horrible neighbor
[14:24] right or he was he was a horrible
[14:27] citizen didn't pay his taxes cheated
[14:29] everybody in government and things you
[14:31] think well this is
[14:31] there's something incongruent so it's
[14:33] the whole picture
[14:35] it's more than just being good at one
[14:37] thing but it's developing into the
[14:38] person that god would want you to be
[14:40] and so true happiness or even personal
[14:42] fulfillment joyfulness
[14:44] is found in proper relationships
[14:47] true happiness and fulfillment in life
[14:49] is found in healthy relationships
[14:51] in with family and friends and i might
[14:54] just refer to it as relationships
[14:55] and suggesting that this in family
[14:57] relationships and it's in friendships
[14:59] but really it's uh it's just in these
[15:01] strong relationships reveal character it
[15:03] promotes character it helps our
[15:04] character
[15:05] and and it really promotes the fullness
[15:07] of life to be in a position to live for
[15:09] somebody else
[15:12] it says in ecclesiastes chapter 4 verses
[15:14] 8 to 12
[15:17] it says there is one alone and there is
[15:19] not a second
[15:23] so the preacher here as it is mentioned
[15:25] is giving us a picture that he
[15:27] as he views something he sees one man he
[15:30] sees them all by himself there's not
[15:32] another person
[15:33] and this is his conclusion he have
[15:35] neither child nor brother
[15:37] yet there's no end of all his labor
[15:38] neither is his eyes satisfied with
[15:40] riches neither saith he for whom do i
[15:42] labor
[15:43] and bereave my soul of good this is also
[15:46] vanity yea
[15:47] it is sore travail for a man to be by
[15:50] himself with no
[15:51] no other relationships no child or
[15:53] brother no heir
[15:54] and and continues to labor continues to
[15:56] work and accumulate wealth
[15:58] he's saying and never has the thought of
[16:00] the question of who am i doing this for
[16:03] who who is this going to be left to he's
[16:06] making this statement that this is
[16:07] vanity
[16:08] this is sore travail this is no way to
[16:10] live
[16:11] what what reward is there if a man
[16:13] labors and accumulates riches but has no
[16:15] one to share it with
[16:17] uh where's the where's the real unction
[16:19] and inspiration to do something and do
[16:21] something right
[16:22] if you're not doing it for someone else
[16:24] then if i just work alone and i just
[16:26] i get a paycheck and and all i do is i
[16:28] deposit into a bank
[16:29] and i and i can't live long enough to
[16:31] spend all of it it's just for you
[16:32] the writer is saying this is vanity and
[16:34] he's also saying that this is something
[16:36] that really would be a labor and a
[16:38] bereavement to one's soul
[16:39] to not be able to share the fruits of
[16:41] his labor
[16:43] and so he continues to or better than
[16:45] one because they have a good reward for
[16:47] their labor
[16:49] for if they fall the one will lift up
[16:50] his fellow there's each one of these
[16:52] principles could be
[16:53] expounded upon or amplified in great
[16:55] detail two are better than one it is not
[16:57] good for man to be alone it is not good
[16:59] for a man
[16:59] to not have companionship or one
[17:01] laboring together with him
[17:03] and he says when there's two there's a
[17:04] greater reward for your labor
[17:06] you say well i want the whole paycheck i
[17:08] don't want to share it well the
[17:09] scripture is saying that if you work and
[17:11] you have fruits of your labor
[17:12] it's a greater reward to be able to
[17:14] share it
[17:16] he says for if they fall and then he
[17:17] gets into the other elements of this if
[17:19] you fall
[17:20] there's one to lift you up a man working
[17:22] by himself when he makes a mistake when
[17:23] he falls when
[17:24] when his labor is singular when his
[17:26] reward is only shared
[17:28] with himself there's not one there to
[17:30] lift him up when he falls down
[17:32] but woe to him that is alone when he
[17:34] falleth for he hath not another to help
[17:35] him
[17:36] up again if two lie together then they
[17:38] have heat but how can one be warm alone
[17:40] and if one prevail against him two shall
[17:43] withstand him
[17:44] and a threefold cord is not quickly
[17:47] broken
[17:49] i i'd love to maybe spend more time on
[17:53] each one of those principles
[17:55] but in one sense i would say this that
[17:58] really what's lifted up to us when we
[18:00] read this
[18:01] is the beauty and strength of family and
[18:03] friends
[18:05] the beauty and strength of having
[18:06] somebody with you and somebody by your
[18:08] side and somebody to labor with you
[18:09] someone who can be there when you fall
[18:11] down and someone who can warm you when
[18:13] you're cold and someone who could
[18:14] fight with you when you have somebody
[18:16] attacking you and so it's really lifting
[18:18] up the beauty and strength of
[18:19] relationships
[18:20] but what what it uses to do so is the
[18:23] contrast
[18:24] of the emptiness of loneliness and the
[18:26] downside of being yourself so it creates
[18:28] a picture on one hand
[18:29] he's painted a beautiful picture but
[18:31] he's having to use some ugly colors to
[18:33] do it
[18:34] to get this to understand that on one
[18:36] hand when you're just one and you're all
[18:38] alone when you fall you can't pick
[18:39] yourself up when you're prevailed
[18:40] against you have no one to fight with
[18:41] you when you lay alone you have no heat
[18:43] and uses all these different examples
[18:45] just to kind of state the obvious we say
[18:46] yep you know what that's right
[18:48] it's not good being alone and so
[18:52] with with um these things kind of just
[18:55] all being foundational maybe very simple
[18:57] i still want to try to maybe move
[18:59] forward a little bit in this
[19:00] but this is a human need this isn't not
[19:04] this isn't just what christians need
[19:05] this isn't just what
[19:06] uh what certain types of people need
[19:09] this is a human need across humanity
[19:11] and it was inherent in the man that god
[19:13] had created
[19:15] that when god had created him the first
[19:17] sentiment and judgment
[19:18] man god gives about him is that it's not
[19:21] good for him
[19:22] to be alone so this was something that
[19:24] was inherent in man this was not the
[19:26] result of his
[19:27] of something he had done this was not
[19:29] something as a result of something adam
[19:31] had said or something he had been
[19:32] exposed to
[19:33] well you've just been online watching
[19:34] too many movies that's why you feel
[19:36] lonely
[19:36] god said hey this is inherent in the man
[19:39] that i created
[19:40] this is something about him this is a
[19:41] human need
[19:44] now i want to kind of give a little bit
[19:45] of a caveat here
[19:47] this does not suggest that any companion
[19:49] or any crowd
[19:50] satisfies our need for relationship god
[19:54] didn't say it's not good for man to be
[19:55] alone just find someone to hang out with
[19:57] find something to call a friend
[19:58] even if it's a volleyball and you call
[20:00] him wilson you just need somebody
[20:02] there was more to it it had to have a
[20:05] deeper connection
[20:06] a deeper expression and so he was not
[20:08] just it's not
[20:09] let's not take from this well i just
[20:10] need somebody
[20:13] and i don't want to be alone so i want
[20:14] to find something uh
[20:16] there's a real caution in that because
[20:17] it's a human need but since it's
[20:20] such a important need you have to be
[20:23] very careful how you satisfy it
[20:25] because relationships can be harmful
[20:28] amen
[20:29] i'm amen and myself now relationships
[20:32] can we call them today toxic
[20:34] and it's about time we found a proper
[20:36] word for it and we say well i don't like
[20:38] that person they're unfriendly i don't
[20:39] like the way they make me feel and
[20:41] after a while we finally figured out you
[20:42] know what that's called it's called
[20:43] toxic
[20:45] it's corrode it corrodes your your
[20:46] attitude and your spirit
[20:48] and it harms you and it hurts you and i
[20:50] was pondering it and i
[20:51] and i realized that this is maybe one
[20:53] way i'll put it now god's
[20:54] answer to adam's loneliness was a help
[20:56] me not a cellmate
[21:00] it was somebody that they were that he
[21:01] could work to get someone that would
[21:03] understand him someone that he would
[21:04] enjoy the company of and not just
[21:06] somebody he was stuck together with
[21:08] and so there there's more to it than
[21:10] just having a crew there's more to it
[21:12] than just having people you hang out
[21:13] with
[21:14] it's more than just having one thing in
[21:15] common and we all like to get together
[21:18] at this at this restaurant to watch the
[21:20] buccaneers play
[21:21] because we're all buccaneers fan it's
[21:22] the only thing you have in common
[21:26] it's more to it than that in first
[21:29] corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 says be
[21:31] not deceived
[21:33] evil communications corrupt good manners
[21:36] and it's a it's a statement i guess that
[21:40] uh
[21:42] may seem a little bit cryptic like the
[21:44] talking bad will corrupt
[21:45] whether or not you you know know where
[21:47] to put the fork on which side of the
[21:48] plate and things like that
[21:50] but it means bad company corrupt
[21:52] corrupts morality
[21:54] evil communication corrupts good manners
[21:57] and
[21:57] the the manners there is ethos it's a
[22:00] moral character the state of being
[22:02] so bad company ruins your ethos i
[22:04] thought about this
[22:05] and just what that really meant and you
[22:07] think about it maybe that's a word that
[22:09] might not be
[22:09] very familiar but it ruins your
[22:11] sentiments it ruins your nature it ruins
[22:13] who you are
[22:14] it perverts it it distorts it so bad
[22:17] company the wrong kind of relationships
[22:19] the wrong kind of friendships
[22:20] the wrong kind of uh conversations or
[22:23] interactions in relationships
[22:26] corrupt your character and corrupt who
[22:28] you are
[22:30] your sentiments your nature your
[22:31] opinions your judgments your ethos
[22:33] and so relationships that weaken or
[22:35] discourage us are not a support
[22:38] i mean i could get an amen or a duh
[22:41] right
[22:42] it's very very obvious but i want you to
[22:43] ponder this a relationship that uh
[22:46] that discourage you a weight
[22:47] relationship that brings you down is not
[22:49] a compliment or a help
[22:51] because god in the beginning gave adam a
[22:52] help me this helped me was one who
[22:54] supports
[22:55] one who aids him one who helps him one
[22:57] that's complementary
[22:59] so true relationship is one that is
[23:01] supposed to be complementary a true
[23:03] relationship
[23:03] is one that strengthens you any
[23:05] relationship that weakens you
[23:07] and tears you down and belittles you or
[23:09] makes you feel
[23:10] uh unimportant or oppressed in any way
[23:14] is not
[23:15] the kind of relationship that god says
[23:17] man needs he says it's not good for men
[23:19] to be alone hey just
[23:20] get you one even if they're horrible and
[23:22] abusive just get you and that's not what
[23:24] god is saying
[23:26] because those kind of relationships that
[23:28] oppress us that are controlling or
[23:29] demeaning
[23:30] are not complementary relationships
[23:34] why because unhealthy relationships do
[23:36] not cultivate the best in you
[23:38] they bring out the worst in you they're
[23:40] not the ones that provoke your good
[23:42] instincts they're not the ones that
[23:43] emphasize
[23:44] uh what's best for you and listen since
[23:46] we're all family here and nobody knows
[23:48] who we're talking about
[23:50] we've seen relationships we think that
[23:52] person they married
[23:53] doesn't balance them out the right way
[23:56] so they're both exactly the same they're
[23:58] both
[23:59] they're both lazy so they always sleep
[24:00] in he needed somebody that would get up
[24:02] at six in the morning get him out of bed
[24:04] right or he's completely clueless he
[24:07] really needed to marry a wife that was
[24:09] very sensitive
[24:10] because when they're both clueless it's
[24:11] like double the trouble
[24:14] and we've we've seen that before in
[24:16] relationships where it's like
[24:17] man there needed to be some balancing
[24:19] there and it's not that the
[24:20] the opposites and he's he's mean and
[24:23] she's sweet
[24:24] the kind of attraction that we talk
[24:25] about the good and the bad but the
[24:26] complimentary
[24:28] i think that's really what what should
[24:30] be meant when we say opposite attracts
[24:31] as well that guy's a liar and she's
[24:33] truthful
[24:33] and they really love each other but one
[24:35] that's complementary to you
[24:37] that's how relationships ought to be
[24:39] complementary supportive
[24:40] and so unhealthy relationships don't
[24:42] bring out the best in you
[24:44] and don't help you with your weaknesses
[24:48] what typically happens in unhealthy
[24:49] relationships is they put you down
[24:51] or they bind your best they hold it back
[24:55] unhealthy relationships are usually
[24:57] characterized by one feeling threatened
[24:58] by the best in you
[25:00] so they want to undermine it and destroy
[25:02] it and weaken it and defile it or
[25:03] pervert it
[25:03] and keep it covered up and
[25:07] it causes you to question your worth it
[25:08] causes you to question your value
[25:10] and so relationships that do that are
[25:12] often manipulative abusive controlling
[25:15] and and it's not this it's more of a
[25:17] dependency
[25:19] uh maybe it's characterized a lot of
[25:20] times in teenage love where one
[25:22] you're infatuated with the other person
[25:24] what does it read jealousy controlling
[25:26] where were you i just went to the
[25:27] bathroom you were gone for five seconds
[25:34] now just to express it in the sense that
[25:39] because there's uh there's other ways
[25:42] that relationships are good for us
[25:44] not just in a complementary sense but in
[25:46] a sense that it challenges us
[25:48] relationships that challenge us or
[25:50] convict us or hold us accountable
[25:52] we should not consider them unhelpful or
[25:54] unsupportive
[25:55] those are the kind you need you need the
[25:58] kind of friendships that
[25:59] that bring a conviction or or encourage
[26:01] you to do better
[26:02] ones that will hold us accountable ones
[26:04] that will challenge us
[26:06] not ones that control us and put us down
[26:07] but ones that are willing to get beneath
[26:09] us and help us
[26:10] in our weakness and in our
[26:11] inefficiencies and the things that we
[26:13] don't do well so just because a
[26:14] relationship challenges us just because
[26:16] a relationship says hey
[26:17] you shouldn't have done that you should
[26:18] say you're sorry doesn't mean well
[26:19] you're toxic
[26:21] i don't have anything to do with you i
[26:22] can't lie and get away with it
[26:25] so there's a there's a there's a health
[26:27] to a relationship that can even be
[26:28] challenging sometimes make us feel like
[26:30] well i didn't do right i didn't do the
[26:31] right thing
[26:32] that's the kind of relationship that can
[26:33] be complementary and those are the kind
[26:34] of relationships that can be helpful
[26:38] in proverbs chapter 27 verses 9 and 10
[26:41] we'll skip a little bit before we get to
[26:43] verse 10. but verse 9 proverbs chapter
[26:46] 27 verse 9 ointment and perfume rejoice
[26:48] the heart there's your justification for
[26:50] buying perfume doesn't say anything i
[26:52] guess a cologne could be an ointment
[26:55] does doterra use this phrase or young
[26:57] living ointment and perfume
[26:59] perfume rejoice the heart so does the
[27:02] sweetness of a man's friend
[27:04] by hearty counsel and so
[27:07] today we're a little bit too macho to
[27:09] call it the sweetness of a man's friend
[27:11] uh but it the scriptures speak in a
[27:13] particular sentiment that's very
[27:15] wonderful
[27:15] the sweetness of a man's friend by
[27:17] hearty counsel rejoices the heart
[27:20] speaks of the beauty of a true
[27:21] friendship a true relationship where
[27:24] there's hearty counsel sincere advice
[27:26] from the heart that when someone's
[27:28] honest with you and they're sincere and
[27:30] they share something with you
[27:31] it rejoices your heart to hear it when
[27:33] it's honest when it's sincere
[27:35] when it's not manipulative when it's not
[27:37] selfish
[27:38] right it rejoices someone it feels good
[27:41] to know that someone opens up to you and
[27:43] shares something to you
[27:44] and the scripture certainly suggests
[27:45] that it can be something that's very
[27:47] direct something
[27:48] very open very frank but it's something
[27:50] that rejoices a man's heart just as an
[27:51] ointment or perfume
[27:53] a man when he has a friend who by hearty
[27:55] counsel on his counsel
[27:57] can share things with them and
[27:58] sentiments to him it's a sweetness to
[28:00] the man
[28:04] in proverbs chapter 27 verse 6 just
[28:06] going a few verses back it says this
[28:08] faithful are the wounds of a friend
[28:11] but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
[28:14] i talk about how this
[28:15] the the open rebuke is better than
[28:17] secret love
[28:19] and it says that a faithful are the
[28:21] wounds of a friend but the kisses of an
[28:23] enemy are deceitful
[28:26] it's a friend that you can trust to be
[28:28] honest even if it's going to hurt a
[28:29] little bit
[28:32] faithful are the wounds of a friend
[28:35] it's it's better to have a friend that
[28:37] will be honest with you
[28:38] and even the wounding and the hurting
[28:40] and the defense that may be caused in
[28:42] sharing it
[28:43] it's better than the vain flattery
[28:47] why because the friend is honest with
[28:49] you to help you
[28:51] but the the kisses of an enemy have
[28:54] selfish motive behind them
[28:56] sure you've heard it before there's a
[28:57] difference between a leader and a
[28:59] manipulator
[29:00] a leader encourages teach encourages you
[29:03] teaches you guides you
[29:04] so the in the journey and the results of
[29:06] the leadership and the guiding
[29:08] accomplishes something for your benefit
[29:11] because jesus says the student shall be
[29:12] as his master
[29:14] he says no one's greater than the
[29:15] teacher no one's greater than the master
[29:17] but through teaching instruction and
[29:18] discipline
[29:19] the master's objective is that the
[29:20] student would become as the master
[29:22] that's a leader but a manipulator wants
[29:25] to control you for his own benefit
[29:27] and do it in such a way to where you can
[29:28] never be as him you'll always need them
[29:32] this is exposes toxic leadership styles
[29:35] and so the scripture speaks to it and
[29:37] says it's better to have a friend who'll
[29:38] be honest with you this is a faithful
[29:40] wound
[29:41] who will open up their heart and be
[29:42] honest even if it hurts than the lies of
[29:44] an enemy that's just vain flattery to
[29:46] puff you up to control you
[29:48] or to get you to do something for their
[29:49] benefit
[29:51] and so these true relationships with
[29:53] family with friends are to be treasured
[29:55] and valued they should not be taken
[29:58] lightly
[29:59] and and they're ones that when you have
[30:01] them you don't have very many of them
[30:04] and so continuing in verse 10 of
[30:06] proverbs 27
[30:07] it says thine own friend and thy
[30:09] father's friend
[30:10] forsake not that shows just how powerful
[30:14] friendship is
[30:15] if your if your father had a friend who
[30:17] the sweetness of it rejoiced his heart
[30:19] by
[30:20] hearty counsel if your father had a
[30:22] friend who was faithful to him and was
[30:24] honest with him
[30:25] and one that stuck with them he said if
[30:27] your father had a friend like that don't
[30:28] abandon him
[30:30] that's how powerful and important these
[30:32] true relationships are that you would
[30:33] give reverence and respect to the
[30:35] relationship
[30:36] that your father had in a friendship
[30:37] that your parent had because that's how
[30:39] valuable these things are
[30:40] so he says don't forsake your own friend
[30:42] don't forsake your father's friend don't
[30:43] abandon true friends
[30:46] then it says neither go unto thy
[30:47] brother's house in the day of thy
[30:49] calamity
[30:50] and it's it's it's kind of just odd
[30:52] construction i i know that i
[30:54] meditated on prayed on it studied it and
[30:56] in times past you look at this and try
[30:57] to understand
[30:58] what's the scripture saying but it's
[31:01] saying that true friendships are to be
[31:03] valued don't abandon don't forsake don't
[31:05] be distant from your friends
[31:06] maintain those relationships your
[31:08] father's friend forsake not
[31:09] and don't be distant and aloof
[31:13] and all by yourself then when you need
[31:16] help you show up
[31:19] says exactly says neither going to thy
[31:20] brother's house on the day of the
[31:21] calamity don't be distant and uninvolved
[31:23] and only show up when you need help hey
[31:24] brother you're a brother right
[31:27] you know we're family family sticks
[31:28] together it's like where have you been
[31:32] family sticks together do you want to
[31:33] give me my car back you borrowed five
[31:35] years ago
[31:36] is that why you're here i haven't seen
[31:38] you since
[31:39] you went out to get milk and never came
[31:41] back and but now when you need help oh
[31:43] you need more milk
[31:45] and that's what the scripture's speaking
[31:46] about that that don't just be distant
[31:48] aloof don't be
[31:49] somebody who's only there and wants to
[31:51] make the promote the relationship
[31:53] and be friendly and be kind when you
[31:55] need something
[31:57] and i'm sure you've all said it maybe
[31:58] you've already said it in 2021
[32:00] okay what do you want you can just tell
[32:02] by the way they're treating you
[32:04] that they they're about to ask a favor
[32:06] you never call me what do you want
[32:09] that's the human nature proverbs is
[32:11] dealing with and then it makes the
[32:13] statement to me that just opens the door
[32:15] in a beautiful way for better is a
[32:17] neighbor that is near than a brother far
[32:19] off
[32:21] so he's saying stick close to true
[32:22] friends
[32:24] true friendships and he uses this
[32:27] contrasting example
[32:28] of how you can have true friendships and
[32:31] then the brother
[32:32] that shows up whenever he needs help
[32:35] that your friends have been there
[32:36] through thick and thin your friends have
[32:37] been there for you value those don't
[32:39] forsake them
[32:40] and then your brother shows up whenever
[32:41] he needs help and he's just pointing out
[32:42] the fact that the ties of blood
[32:44] may be less reliable than those of true
[32:46] friendship
[32:48] it's not saying that we ought to disdain
[32:49] them or we ought to weaken them or we
[32:51] ought to forsake our brother but rather
[32:52] it's saying that there's a
[32:54] there is better is a neighbor who is
[32:56] close in heart
[32:57] better as a neighbor who's there with
[32:59] you in spirit than one a family member
[33:01] whose heart is distant from you
[33:06] and we've we can experience this in life
[33:07] that our family oftentimes will let us
[33:09] down
[33:10] but our friends don't or certain friends
[33:12] don't
[33:13] he's saying that the the loyalty of
[33:14] blood and the affinity that family ought
[33:16] to have each other says this has been
[33:18] corrupted these standards have been
[33:19] broken
[33:19] the the way that even you look at the
[33:21] old testament how the scripture was
[33:22] written in the laws in israel
[33:24] how that a brother would look after his
[33:26] brother's family and have obligations to
[33:27] his wife and to his children
[33:29] why because that's what family did
[33:32] but now the proverbs begin to speak how
[33:34] this this understanding and this
[33:35] offended in this closeness
[33:37] and the real meaning of family is
[33:38] getting watered down and so there's
[33:40] friends that are there for you and that
[33:41] there's ties of friendship and affinity
[33:43] and there's a neighbor who's closer in
[33:45] heart
[33:45] closer in spirit and nearer to you to
[33:47] help you than the family member whose
[33:49] heart is distant from you
[33:51] who's not caring or supportive or
[33:53] empathetic of what you're going through
[33:56] proverbs chapter 18 verse 24
[34:00] and again i'm i'm using what i'm doing
[34:03] in case you haven't figured it out what
[34:05] i'm trying to do
[34:06] is highlight with other scriptures what
[34:09] god said about man in the beginning
[34:11] he said it's not good for man to be
[34:12] alone these scriptures in ecclesiastes
[34:15] and corinthians and proverbs 27
[34:17] and 18 and 17 different places we'll
[34:19] read
[34:20] is is just later on expressing
[34:24] the dynamics of the different facets of
[34:26] how it's not good for man to be alone
[34:27] and what this togetherness and
[34:29] relationships are accomplishing for the
[34:31] man
[34:31] this is what god saw in the beginning
[34:34] proverbs 18 24 says a man that hath
[34:37] friends must show himself
[34:38] friendly and there is a friend that
[34:40] sticketh closer
[34:41] than a brother
[34:45] this is uh i i wanted to i was going to
[34:48] say a misunderstood scripture but maybe
[34:50] we could just say it's
[34:51] interpreted differently and we most
[34:53] often read this that if you want to have
[34:55] friends be friendly
[34:56] now that's true right if you want to
[34:59] have friends be friendly and that's how
[35:01] this scripture is often uh interpreted
[35:03] or expressed is that a man who hath
[35:06] friends must show himself friendly
[35:08] but in the language that's used and a
[35:11] lot of other
[35:12] some other translations actually render
[35:13] it this way even in other languages that
[35:15] it
[35:16] it speaks it this way it's touching on
[35:17] the danger
[35:19] of someone wanting to have a lot of
[35:21] friends
[35:23] because if a man wants to have a lot of
[35:24] friends if a man is going to have
[35:26] friends and speaks of a multitude of
[35:27] friends or a lot of friends then he's
[35:28] got to show himself
[35:30] friendly and so there's a danger in
[35:32] having a lot of shallow friendships
[35:35] there's a danger in even the weakened
[35:37] bond of family
[35:38] and saying the man with too many friends
[35:40] is only increasing the chances
[35:42] that he will be hurt broken or used
[35:46] by those friendships because a man who
[35:48] wants to have a lot of friends has got
[35:49] to be really friendly
[35:51] and so it can get to where it's more
[35:53] surface you want to be friendly you want
[35:54] to have friends hey i'll treat you to
[35:56] dinner hey i'll do this
[35:57] let's do that and you want to be the guy
[35:58] hey hey hey you know everybody's great
[36:00] everybody's friendly hey how's it going
[36:02] i remember your name
[36:03] hey let's go out to lunch hey i'll get
[36:04] your lunch hey i like those shoes where
[36:06] did you get those shoes
[36:07] i tell you what i'm going to buy another
[36:08] pair i'm going to get you one in brown
[36:10] and it's like this kind of he just wants
[36:11] to be a buddy wants to be a friend
[36:13] they say a man who wants friends a man
[36:15] who has a lot of friends to meet the
[36:16] need of companionship and friendship
[36:18] is making himself vulnerable to be used
[36:21] because he's spreading himself so thin
[36:23] and it's
[36:23] so many shallow relationships the
[36:25] chances are you're going to be taken
[36:26] advantage of
[36:27] you're going to be used you're going to
[36:28] be let down you're going to be rejected
[36:31] why because a man wants to be friendly
[36:32] wants to have a lot of friends so it's
[36:34] touching on
[36:35] on the danger of not having true
[36:37] meaningful connections with people
[36:41] a man that have friends must show
[36:42] himself friendly so it kind of raises
[36:44] this specter
[36:46] of a man with many friends is in danger
[36:49] of ruin
[36:51] but that says there is a friend that
[36:53] sticketh closer than a brother
[36:55] there's you can have a lot of friends
[36:57] and a lot of shallow friendships and
[36:58] those friends
[36:59] most likely will not be there for you
[37:01] when you need them but a real friend
[37:02] though he may not be many
[37:04] he sticketh closer than a brother he had
[37:05] he tears to you clings joins
[37:07] to stay close by you sticks closer than
[37:10] a brother
[37:12] the many friends the man who have
[37:13] friends plural must show himself
[37:15] friendly those friends may forsake you
[37:16] when it's convenient for them
[37:20] or when it's inconvenient for you
[37:23] but there's a friend whose loyalty and
[37:25] faithfulness
[37:27] is made known when it counts so you can
[37:30] take this man who has many friends he
[37:32] may have many friends
[37:33] and he showed himself friendly but then
[37:35] something happens
[37:37] and in a time of need and when he's in
[37:39] trouble all the many friends begin to
[37:41] run away
[37:42] but there's that one friend that starts
[37:44] running in
[37:46] there's a friend that sticketh closer
[37:47] than a brother there's a friend who the
[37:50] real
[37:50] value of that friendship is made known
[37:52] when it counts in uncertain times in
[37:54] times of calamity or different
[37:55] difficulty
[37:56] the genuine friend is the one that
[37:58] reveals himself
[38:00] they're the ones that stick sticks their
[38:01] neck out they're the ones that calls
[38:03] they're the ones that say what can i do
[38:04] to help they're the ones that says i
[38:05] know this doesn't look good this is a
[38:07] pretty nasty situation
[38:08] let's figure this out
[38:12] the bible says in proverbs 17 17
[38:16] and it's uh i was just looking at all
[38:19] these scriptures last week and i was
[38:21] in my mind i was putting them in
[38:23] categories and i felt you know if this
[38:24] was a puzzle none of these pieces would
[38:26] fit
[38:28] and and and i just realized that the
[38:30] real the
[38:32] what made the pieces fit is there's a
[38:34] true image of a brother
[38:36] and there's a true image of a friend but
[38:39] then the false
[38:40] the the failure of a brother um
[38:43] is is contrasted by the success of a
[38:46] true friend the value of a true friend
[38:49] and so it's it's not to suggest that in
[38:51] the end friendship is better than family
[38:54] but that when something fails to meet
[38:57] expectations when something fails to
[38:58] meet its purpose into what it's
[39:00] suited for that's when you really value
[39:02] the true relationships that god gives
[39:04] you
[39:05] because this says a friend loveth at all
[39:07] times and a brother is born for
[39:09] adversity
[39:12] now i want to say this at the outset as
[39:14] i read this
[39:17] a true friend becomes a brother during
[39:18] the time of trouble
[39:21] and i'll try to express it because it's
[39:24] pointing to
[39:25] to relationships and even the failure of
[39:27] family duty
[39:28] and so the bible's making a distinction
[39:30] among different types of relationships
[39:32] you could say a man who has many friends
[39:34] has shallow friends or
[39:35] just has as buddies or has people he
[39:37] knows or acquaintances
[39:38] but then there's friends that are real
[39:40] genuine friends and so it's giving you
[39:42] these categories of people
[39:43] these kind of acquaintances people are
[39:45] at arm's length they won't be there for
[39:47] you
[39:47] when you need them necessarily and
[39:48] that's not a judgment on them it doesn't
[39:51] have to be a judgment on them but you're
[39:52] saying these true friends they can be
[39:53] there for you
[39:54] and listen this isn't td jake's theory
[39:56] on three kinds of friendship by the way
[39:58] you know try to avoid that but it's just
[40:01] scripture pointing out there's different
[40:03] types of relationships
[40:05] he says a friend loveth at all times a
[40:06] real friend's gonna love you through
[40:07] good and bad
[40:09] through thick and thin so it says a
[40:10] friend a true friend loves at all times
[40:12] things are going bad they love you
[40:13] things are going good they love you
[40:14] but it says a brother is born for
[40:16] adverse in other words a brother's love
[40:18] is especially known when things are bad
[40:21] friend loves you when things are good a
[40:23] friend loves you when they're bad but
[40:24] this kind of brotherly love
[40:26] is something that really manifests when
[40:28] things go wrong
[40:30] and this is how a friend can be one that
[40:32] sticks closer than a brother
[40:35] and so there's a friend that sticketh
[40:36] closer than a brother because a brother
[40:38] has a duty
[40:39] and when a friend fulfills the duty that
[40:42] even a brother has and the brother
[40:44] doesn't that's the friend that sticketh
[40:45] closer than a brother
[40:47] she even catch the true purpose of a
[40:49] family it says a brother is born for
[40:51] adversity how many have ever
[40:53] quoted this saying friends love me at
[40:55] all times but my sibling was born
[40:57] for fighting has anyone quoted it that
[41:00] way before
[41:01] i've i've heard it quoted that way i
[41:03] think i've probably quoted that
[41:04] way before friends love you at all times
[41:07] but brothers are born
[41:08] for or for strife and they're born for
[41:11] adversity and you're born fighting
[41:12] you're born disagreeing it's the sibling
[41:14] rivalry
[41:15] and they found that for children and
[41:17] toddlers and
[41:19] even into adolescence they learn at a
[41:20] very early age
[41:22] that they can treat their sibling any
[41:24] way they want and they're still there
[41:27] they don't go away i took the toy away
[41:31] from them and they
[41:32] they still force him to play with me
[41:36] i wake up in the morning they're still
[41:37] there at breakfast and they think
[41:39] i can say whatever do whatever i want
[41:41] cheat lie still take grab do it a punch
[41:43] kick
[41:44] and they still have to be my friend
[41:47] and then they try it at school and that
[41:49] person never talks to him anymore
[41:51] and they realize okay well i can't do
[41:52] this to everybody not everybody's like
[41:53] this guy at home
[41:55] who i can't get rid of and that's why
[41:58] sibling rivalry and the way siblings can
[41:59] treat each other sometimes
[42:00] worse than the way they treat other
[42:02] people because there's the consequence
[42:04] there's real consequence in the real
[42:05] world
[42:06] mom and dad are going to force you to be
[42:08] best friends you're all wearing gingham
[42:10] this morning to church i don't care if
[42:11] you don't want to look like your brother
[42:12] right
[42:13] you're forced to do it
[42:17] oh great they're all wearing gingham
[42:18] today bad bad timing
[42:22] so a brother is born for a diversity it
[42:25] means a brother is born
[42:27] think about how powerful this he's
[42:29] brought into this world
[42:30] for hard times not to cause him
[42:35] but to be there for you during it
[42:38] that god gives you that brother one that
[42:40] is born you can say even a son in the
[42:42] family is born god can say well it's not
[42:43] good that he doesn't have a brother
[42:45] he should have a brother why because the
[42:46] brother is born for hard times
[42:49] this is by god's design
[42:52] this is this is a brother's purpose a
[42:54] brother's purpose you want to have a you
[42:55] want to know what you're meant for jack
[42:56] you want to know what you're meant for
[42:57] press do you want to know what a
[42:58] brother's purpose is
[42:59] you're there to be there for your
[43:01] siblings you're there to be there for
[43:03] your sister you're there to be there for
[43:04] your brothers a brother's purpose
[43:06] is to help your your family when they
[43:09] need it
[43:11] and you say well what about me well
[43:12] that's what they're there for for you
[43:15] this is part of god's design a brother
[43:17] is born for adversity he's born for the
[43:20] hard times his very purpose is fulfilled
[43:22] that when you need help he's there to
[43:23] help you
[43:25] if a brother forsakes an adversity then
[43:27] he does not fulfill the purpose for
[43:28] which he was born into this world
[43:31] that's exactly what the scripture is
[43:32] saying a brother is born so that he
[43:34] would be there for you when you need him
[43:37] and so a brother who's not there when
[43:38] you need him has not fulfilled his
[43:40] purpose for being born
[43:42] now some of you young people if you're
[43:43] creative you can use this to your
[43:44] advantage in the next week
[43:51] in genesis chapter 4 verse and the lord
[43:54] said unto cain well maybe we could give
[43:55] a little bit of background
[43:58] cain just killed his brother and then
[44:01] god comes to
[44:03] cain and he says where is abel thy
[44:05] brethren
[44:06] and now notice how cain in this uh
[44:10] mode of self-justification and guilt
[44:12] says i know not so he lied and he says
[44:14] am i my brother's keeper
[44:17] and i was wondering is this the first
[44:19] instance of gaslighting
[44:22] i mean like the way that he he comes off
[44:24] at god is pretty
[44:26] uh pretty bold i don't know
[44:29] are you crazy what am i supposed to look
[44:32] after my brother
[44:33] and it's kind of like well yeah
[44:36] what are you asking me that that way for
[44:37] like i'm crazy for thinking you should
[44:39] have looked after your brother
[44:40] i'm crazy for knowing that you murdered
[44:42] your brother
[44:44] and he says i i don't know where he is
[44:45] am i my brother's people am i
[44:47] responsible to look after my brother am
[44:49] i responsible
[44:50] to protect and care for him listen the
[44:52] question's not answered but you should
[44:53] know
[44:54] that when cain asked this he asked it
[44:56] very dishonestly
[44:57] because by virtue of birth he had an
[44:59] obligation
[45:00] to his brother to protect him and care
[45:02] for him he certainly should not have
[45:04] killed him
[45:05] right we maybe we can all agree on that
[45:08] but the point i would really like you to
[45:09] to understand and let it hit you and be
[45:12] in heart a brother is born for a
[45:14] difficult time a brother is born for the
[45:16] times when you need somebody to be by
[45:18] you
[45:18] even if it's just their presence their
[45:20] conscious presence to be standing there
[45:21] by you saying hey i'm with you
[45:23] you got a job to do i'm here hey i can't
[45:26] help you but i just want you to know i'm
[45:27] right here with you
[45:30] and just the moral support that can be
[45:32] there the knowing that there's there's
[45:33] there's no judgment coming and even if
[45:35] there's a difference opinion like man i
[45:36] would have never done it that way but
[45:37] hey don't worry about i'm here buddy
[45:39] i'm here to help you cain had that
[45:42] responsibility
[45:45] he says am i my brother's keeper yes you
[45:48] are you are his keeper you are tasked
[45:52] with looking out after him your task
[45:53] that that making sure you protect him
[45:55] and care for him
[45:57] because the family was structured to
[45:59] look out after every member
[46:01] the family unit was one in which all the
[46:03] members would feel safe it was one in
[46:04] which all the members would feel
[46:06] you useful it was one in which all were
[46:08] cared for emotionally
[46:09] and physically it was something that the
[46:10] family the household was to do
[46:12] they were kept safe they were protected
[46:14] from elements protected from assailants
[46:16] all those different things they were
[46:17] cared for not just physically but also
[46:19] emotionally
[46:20] that's what family meant and was meant
[46:21] to be in the beginning
[46:25] and so when it says that god gave adam a
[46:29] help me god gave the man someone who is
[46:31] like him
[46:32] to help him considering god's divine
[46:35] purpose
[46:36] for him he gave it to him to meet a need
[46:42] and brother brandon makes a statement in
[46:43] the sermon the law having a shadow
[46:46] and he's describing just how beautiful
[46:48] the woman was
[46:49] and how strong and handsome adam would
[46:51] have been
[46:52] and there's there's some there would
[46:55] maybe be differences in terms of
[46:57] what what you would consider beautiful
[46:59] and what uh you would
[47:01] uh how you would describe the man and
[47:03] how you would describe the woman but he
[47:04] was i believe in one place he's making
[47:05] reference to how an artist drew
[47:07] adam and the woman up is the most
[47:08] horrible ugly awful looking creatures
[47:11] and the point was no these would have
[47:12] been beautiful specimens
[47:15] and and beautiful not in a worldly sense
[47:18] but just in
[47:18] in a god-given beauty and a natural
[47:20] beauty there would have been a radiance
[47:22] to them
[47:22] and so brother graham's describing this
[47:24] woman coming forth and we know the bible
[47:26] says and he brought her unto the man
[47:28] he says when adam looked at her listen
[47:30] to this statement when adam looked at
[47:32] her
[47:32] it put such a shock that still lives in
[47:36] mankind
[47:39] when this beautiful woman was first seen
[47:41] by the man
[47:42] it's as if something it something
[47:44] shocked him
[47:45] and now something in his dna something
[47:47] in his nature
[47:49] has now been triggered something has
[47:51] happened within the man
[47:52] he says and it still lives in mankind
[47:54] today
[47:56] before that adam would have never known
[47:57] those feelings before that adam would
[47:59] have never been able to understand those
[48:01] feelings if he had them before that adam
[48:03] would have never
[48:04] been able to imagine or have be
[48:06] conscious of certain
[48:07] certain things but now when he sees the
[48:09] woman it puts a shock
[48:11] in not just adam but mankind
[48:16] if you could even look at it these two
[48:19] i'd like to say omnipotence
[48:21] but these two pieces of this beautiful
[48:23] picture being introduced together
[48:26] there's something that was imprint that
[48:27] was left in humanity
[48:30] there was something that shook and
[48:32] reverberated both in man and woman
[48:34] that that still resides within humanity
[48:37] today
[48:38] and i would say that it speaks to a
[48:40] man's attraction for a woman that's the
[48:42] way that god
[48:43] it was done that's how it happened in
[48:45] the beginning that's the shock that was
[48:47] within humanity in the beginning
[48:48] and it speaks to that but it's not just
[48:50] the attraction to the woman
[48:52] that still resides within mankind today
[48:55] but it was a need it put such a shock
[48:59] that still lives in mankind today
[49:01] it was the kind of shock that when man
[49:03] was struck with this image
[49:05] he could never be the same alone again
[49:09] it was a shock to which now he knew he
[49:11] needed true family
[49:12] now he knew he needed friendship now he
[49:14] knew he needed companionship
[49:16] adam could have never gone back to the
[49:17] way it was before
[49:20] because of this need and it's because of
[49:22] that need you see that adam
[49:24] does not abandon his wife because in the
[49:26] beginning the malachi says why did he
[49:27] just make one one man one woman and it
[49:30] speaks on the subject of marriage and
[49:31] divorce
[49:32] it's because when adam when his wife
[49:34] failed or when she sinned
[49:35] against him he did not have another one
[49:38] that he could take there was only one
[49:39] so his need for companionship his need
[49:42] for harmony his need for satisfaction
[49:44] could only be met through redemption so
[49:46] we act to redeem her
[49:47] from his need to have her
[49:51] listen pride is is such a filthy nasty
[49:54] thing
[49:55] to where we don't want to admit that
[49:57] we're vulnerable we don't want to admit
[49:58] that we're needy
[49:59] we don't want to admit that we i i need
[50:03] you
[50:04] i can't live without you and sometimes
[50:07] we gotta kind of want to posture a
[50:08] little bit say hey babe i don't need you
[50:11] i i i i can make a living in a better
[50:14] one without you
[50:15] and we may not put it in those crude
[50:17] terms but sometimes we can act and live
[50:20] in such a way to where it's like hey i'm
[50:21] the man i'm the one that brings home the
[50:23] bacon
[50:24] i'm the one that bought the house i'm
[50:25] the one that makes the car payment i i
[50:28] i could get rid of you tomorrow and i
[50:29] could pay someone to
[50:31] to come clean my house and wash my
[50:33] clothes ever heard of uber eats babe
[50:35] i can eat three meals a day i don't need
[50:37] you right and we don't want to admit the
[50:40] truth is honey i need you
[50:42] god didn't make me to live without you
[50:45] maybe i could look this way and say it
[50:47] god didn't make me to live without you
[50:49] if he wanted me to live alone then i
[50:51] would see this pattern in scripture
[50:53] that this is the way that god placed it
[50:55] this is the way that god desired it to
[50:57] be
[50:59] now maybe someone said well what about
[51:00] paul when he said
[51:02] you know there's a pretty good
[51:03] scriptural argument that paul may have
[51:04] been a widower
[51:06] because for him to have taken those
[51:07] places he did at the sanhedrin
[51:09] the requirements were to be married so
[51:11] we can debate that all day long if you
[51:13] want to use
[51:14] paul saying i would that you'd be like
[51:15] me but it's the sum this shock
[51:19] that mankind felt is still deep within
[51:21] us
[51:22] what is it it's a longing to fit in it's
[51:26] a longing
[51:26] to be understood it's a longing to be
[51:29] loved it's a longing to
[51:30] belong to feel whole at that moment
[51:34] when adam saw the woman this shock that
[51:36] reverberated within him that still
[51:37] is exists within mankind there's
[51:40] basically adam could never feel complete
[51:42] if she left god said just took her away
[51:45] and he'd be like wait a minute what just
[51:46] happened
[51:47] and god's like oh nothing it was it was
[51:48] beta we want to go back we want to try
[51:50] that again
[51:51] we're not ready to roll this out it's
[51:52] not for public distribution yet
[51:54] and he's starting adam's like wait a
[51:56] minute i'll take the beta i mean
[51:58] what are you doing i can't i can't live
[52:00] with i can't i can't ever be the same
[52:02] after that moment and he would have been
[52:04] chasing that
[52:05] his entire life like wait a minute wait
[52:07] a minute and this is something that
[52:08] happens to all it still resides deep
[52:10] within mankind
[52:11] adam would have never felt whole if the
[52:13] woman disappeared
[52:16] there's a feeling of completeness to be
[52:17] needed even to be useful
[52:21] and it's so essential and so necessary
[52:25] that god promises to meet that need
[52:27] himself
[52:30] this is what's beautiful it's so
[52:32] essential and so necessary
[52:34] that god acknowledges that through
[52:36] circumstances and because of the
[52:38] and because of sin that one could be in
[52:40] a situation to where they are deprived
[52:43] of children they're deprived of
[52:44] companionship they're deprived of a
[52:46] spouse and god says
[52:48] this is so necessary for one to feel
[52:50] whole and complete
[52:51] that i will promise that i will give you
[52:54] that satisfaction
[52:55] through myself
[52:59] and then the real beauty of it is he
[53:00] says he brings it to
[53:03] the manner in which he most often does
[53:05] it himself
[53:06] is he does it through relationships
[53:09] he says you you need a brother i'll be
[53:12] your brother
[53:13] how lord i'm going to give you a friend
[53:16] you need a family i'll be your family
[53:20] how lord i'll give you one
[53:23] psalm 68 verses 5 and 6. we mentioned
[53:27] this in the
[53:27] last few services and so
[53:30] if you feel like you've already got it
[53:31] figured out you can kind of check out
[53:33] for a few minutes
[53:34] but psalm 68 verses 5 and 6 this is god
[53:38] speaking of god as it says at the end of
[53:40] this first verse a father
[53:42] of the fatherless and the judge of the
[53:44] widows is god in his holy habitation
[53:46] i want to read verse 6 as well god
[53:48] saideth the solitary
[53:50] families he bringeth out those which are
[53:52] bound with chains
[53:53] but the rebellious dwell in a dry land
[53:57] so it says the kind of the the the
[53:59] center of this
[54:00] this will of the father the followers
[54:02] judge of the widows set of solitary
[54:03] families brings out those that are bound
[54:05] with chains
[54:05] kind of the center of that is god in his
[54:07] holy habitation
[54:09] it creates this image the hebrew words
[54:11] that are used it's god
[54:12] in his home god in his position
[54:16] god in his calling god fulfilling his
[54:19] purpose
[54:20] is these things god in his holy
[54:22] habitation
[54:23] is a father to those who need fathers
[54:26] god fulfilling his purpose god
[54:28] fulfilling
[54:28] what he is and is expressing his
[54:31] attributes
[54:32] he is a father to those who are orphaned
[54:34] he's a father to those who are abandoned
[54:36] he's the father to those who've been
[54:37] forsaken
[54:38] he is protector and provider and
[54:40] comforter to those who do not have a
[54:41] father
[54:42] the bible is explicitly stating that we
[54:44] can say a man has a need for a father he
[54:47] has a need for that kind of relationship
[54:49] in those who've been orphaned abandoned
[54:50] rejected estranged
[54:52] and are no longer protected and
[54:53] comforted and provided by that fatherly
[54:55] relationship
[54:56] he says i will be that to you i will do
[54:59] it
[55:02] god is a defender of those who have no
[55:04] husbands
[55:06] it doesn't mean a judge of the widows
[55:07] where he sits back like this is a beauty
[55:08] competition well i'll give her an 8 out
[55:10] of 10.
[55:11] that's not what judge of the widows
[55:12] means it means a protector a defender
[55:15] he is someone that's going to come to
[55:16] her aid into her defense
[55:18] god is a defender of those who have no
[55:19] husbands
[55:21] he's a protector he's a friend is even
[55:23] how some translations render it i found
[55:24] a couple
[55:25] uh translations called him the right
[55:27] ruler
[55:29] of the widow the right kind of rule the
[55:32] right ruler that she ought to have had
[55:33] the right
[55:34] ruler that the the kind of husband that
[55:36] she deserved the champion friend
[55:39] is the word that's used he's going to be
[55:41] a judge the champion friend one who will
[55:44] champion her cause
[55:45] look at her needs look at her weaknesses
[55:46] look what she's lacking and be there to
[55:48] meet those needs
[55:49] do we not see this type time and time
[55:51] again in the scripture
[55:52] and in the old testament that god is
[55:54] mindful of them than that god is
[55:56] it comes to their aid and comes to their
[55:58] defense
[56:00] god in his home in his position as a
[56:02] father of the orphan and the abandoned
[56:03] god
[56:04] is a defender and a protector the right
[56:06] ruler the champion friend of the widows
[56:07] those without husbands
[56:09] thus he makes a home he sets the
[56:11] solitary families he makes a home for
[56:13] the lonely
[56:15] those that are all by himself and makes
[56:18] them part of something
[56:20] he said at the solitary families he
[56:22] takes them and makes them part of a
[56:23] family
[56:24] and then the next verse is is directly
[56:26] tied to it he bringeth out those which
[56:28] are bound with chains he takes
[56:30] the bound and broken by the hand and
[56:32] leads them to a place of liberty and
[56:34] prosperity
[56:35] he loses them from their difficulty
[56:36] loses them from their downtroddenesses
[56:38] takes them out of the bondage that
[56:40] they're
[56:40] once in he says i'm going to take you by
[56:42] the hand and i'm going to set you in a
[56:44] family i'm going to give you the proper
[56:45] kind of relationships i'm going to
[56:47] improve your well-being
[56:48] he sees the broken and he sees the needy
[56:51] and as a man
[56:52] in his place and in his position he
[56:54] takes you by the hand
[56:55] and leads you out of that brokenness
[56:58] this is part of god this is part of
[57:00] god's character
[57:03] this could have been written of god in
[57:05] genesis 1
[57:06] 1. in the beginning was god who in his
[57:09] holy habitation had the
[57:11] characteristics and the attributes to be
[57:13] a father to those who had none
[57:15] to be a husband to those who had none to
[57:17] put people who had no family and
[57:18] placement families
[57:19] and to take those were broken and
[57:21] downtrodden rejected and wound and
[57:22] bruised and scattered to take them by
[57:24] the hand
[57:25] and lead them to liberty to break the
[57:27] bar the chains that bind them
[57:28] and set them in a place of prosperity it
[57:30] could have said that about god in
[57:31] genesis 1
[57:32] 1. and this is why god instinctively
[57:36] declared when he saw adam all by himself
[57:38] it's not good for a man to be just by
[57:40] himself
[57:42] god did not want adam to feel that way
[57:45] neither does god want you to feel alone
[57:46] neither does god want you to feel
[57:48] abandoned
[57:48] neither does god want you to feel
[57:50] rejection
[57:53] now i realize that any time you preach
[57:56] you know you want to preach
[57:57] you're going to preach for eight hours
[57:58] so you can always throw the qualifiers
[57:59] out there
[58:00] you know and kind of reign it in god
[58:03] uses our emotions to get our attention
[58:06] and we could suffer rejected because god
[58:09] wants us
[58:10] to feel that but not because he wants us
[58:12] to be rejected but because he's wanting
[58:14] us to come to something he's wanting to
[58:17] teach us something so he uses the
[58:18] rejection he uses the
[58:20] hurt feelings he uses our emotions it's
[58:22] the sorrow that's quicken inside of us
[58:24] that leads us to a place of repentance
[58:26] it's the it's the pain of guilt and
[58:28] conviction that causes us to say we're
[58:30] sorry to somebody else
[58:32] it's the feeling that you heard somebody
[58:34] that caused you to humble yourself so
[58:35] emotions and feelings are fine
[58:36] he said well god doesn't want you to be
[58:38] ejected it's the same sense that paul
[58:39] says you may be
[58:40] cast down but not forsaken you may feel
[58:43] the being cast down but god does not
[58:45] want your final state and your
[58:46] characterization
[58:47] and your general existence to be one of
[58:49] being dejected and alone and hurting and
[58:51] abused
[58:53] i mean you think about it to be alone
[58:54] and be i feel lonely is probably the
[58:56] most
[58:56] devastating of emotions especially the
[59:00] unrequited love when there's feelings
[59:02] there's
[59:02] something has been expressed you you
[59:04] share how you feel you put your
[59:06] you lay yourself down on the line you
[59:08] you're wanting to work on something
[59:09] you're wanting to promote something
[59:11] and and you put your heart into it and
[59:12] you're in love and you try to you try to
[59:14] see that this thing can be successful
[59:16] and then you're met with rejection
[59:17] that's the greatest hurt that a natural
[59:19] man can feel
[59:20] or a natural woman could feel and that's
[59:23] why the devil prays on those emotions
[59:26] that's why he kind of uses those
[59:27] insecurities and the fears of rejection
[59:29] to cause us to enter into the kind of
[59:31] relationships that aren't healthy and
[59:33] don't promote the best you
[59:36] the devil preys on those feelings i
[59:38] don't want to be abandoned i don't want
[59:39] to be rejected
[59:40] that sense of loneliness and the devil
[59:42] working on that
[59:43] leads us to the wrong things but god
[59:47] says i want to meet that i want to
[59:48] satisfy that myself
[59:52] and so we're moving
[59:55] moving moving along rather well today
[59:57] it's almost 11 30.
[59:59] let me just try to put this in some some
[1:00:01] terms that might just give us some
[1:00:02] conclusions to go forward a true family
[1:00:06] gives us a sense of identity and would
[1:00:09] give us a sense i'm proud to be
[1:00:10] identified with this family that there's
[1:00:12] there's the kind of harmony the
[1:00:13] togetherness and what we support and
[1:00:15] what we do and how we live our lives it
[1:00:16] gives a
[1:00:17] an individual a sense of belonging and
[1:00:19] identity family satisfies that shock
[1:00:22] part of that shock and that longing deep
[1:00:24] within mankind
[1:00:26] and man within the confines of that
[1:00:28] family and woman in the confines of that
[1:00:30] family a son and daughter
[1:00:32] grow and mature and they find their
[1:00:33] identity and their satisfaction and
[1:00:35] their joy and their belonging
[1:00:36] in that family but then they mature to a
[1:00:38] point to where now there's another need
[1:00:40] that needs to be fulfilled
[1:00:41] and that can't be fulfilled alone within
[1:00:43] that family so what does god do he makes
[1:00:44] another one
[1:00:46] so that shock is always met that shock
[1:00:48] deep within mankind is always met
[1:00:50] through these relationships and i want
[1:00:53] to say this that true
[1:00:54] a true church functions in a similar way
[1:00:58] it's a place where we should feel at
[1:00:59] home
[1:01:01] it's a place that we feel that we belong
[1:01:04] listen if you won't eat at a restaurant
[1:01:05] because you're uncomfortable
[1:01:09] and you're not certain how it's being
[1:01:10] prepared and you don't like the people
[1:01:12] that serve you and everyone's rude and
[1:01:13] they don't ever let you sit where you
[1:01:14] want and you just
[1:01:16] hey right if you're dissatisfied where
[1:01:18] you're going to lunch and you don't like
[1:01:20] the people
[1:01:20] then don't go to lunch there and if
[1:01:22] church is a place you're not comfortable
[1:01:24] don't keep forcing yourself to go to an
[1:01:26] uncomfortable church
[1:01:27] church shouldn't be that way right
[1:01:31] that's not what church is for is a place
[1:01:32] to always be uncomfortable
[1:01:34] now i know there's a lot of preachers
[1:01:35] that say that and one i can't remember
[1:01:37] who it was that said it we're going back
[1:01:38] hundreds of years now he says the goal
[1:01:40] of ministry
[1:01:41] is to comfort the afflicted and afflict
[1:01:42] the comforted
[1:01:44] i don't know if i buy into that
[1:01:45] necessarily but i get the point
[1:01:48] but something about church should be a
[1:01:49] place where you feel safe enough to be
[1:01:51] corrected
[1:01:52] you feel safe enough to be afflicted
[1:01:54] like you can trust the person who's
[1:01:55] afflicting you
[1:01:56] okay i know you got a plan in this you
[1:01:58] know i know there's a purpose in this so
[1:02:00] afflict away and so church should have
[1:02:03] the same feelings where you have a sense
[1:02:04] of identity and belonging and you feel
[1:02:06] sheltered
[1:02:08] and the bible says this speaking to the
[1:02:10] believer in galatians chapter 6 verse 10
[1:02:12] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[1:02:14] do good
[1:02:15] unto all men especially unto them who
[1:02:18] are of the household to faith
[1:02:20] so the first one is you have to do good
[1:02:22] unto all men
[1:02:24] that we are all as believers under a
[1:02:26] responsibility a christian
[1:02:28] is responsible for doing good unto all
[1:02:30] men
[1:02:31] we don't ask their political affiliation
[1:02:33] first to determine whether or not we
[1:02:34] should be good to them
[1:02:36] right you do good unto all men how you
[1:02:38] treat others is how you treat christ
[1:02:40] this is something that we're taught from
[1:02:41] the scripture it's something we ought to
[1:02:43] know from the beginning
[1:02:44] that there's no room for being bitter
[1:02:46] being vengeful being inspiteful being
[1:02:47] nasty
[1:02:48] to anyone do good unto all men but paul
[1:02:51] makes this distinction
[1:02:52] especially unto them who are of the
[1:02:54] household of faith in other words
[1:02:55] those that belong to the family of faith
[1:02:58] the household it means related by blood
[1:03:00] or of the same house so those who are in
[1:03:02] the faith
[1:03:03] relate to one another as family and are
[1:03:05] considered a family
[1:03:07] and therefore when we gather us into
[1:03:09] church we should promote the virtues of
[1:03:12] family
[1:03:13] you should have a sense that we are
[1:03:15] family
[1:03:17] not just a connection of individuals
[1:03:19] that are a group of individuals that are
[1:03:21] loosely connected to something like
[1:03:22] we think we all believe the same
[1:03:26] notice what he teaches timothy first
[1:03:28] timothy chapter 5 verses 1 and 2 rebuke
[1:03:30] not an elder
[1:03:32] but entreat him as a father and the
[1:03:35] younger men is brethren
[1:03:37] the elder women as mothers the younger
[1:03:40] as sisters with all purity
[1:03:43] first timothy chapter 5 verses 1 and 2
[1:03:45] again rebuke not an elder
[1:03:47] but entreat him as a father so we could
[1:03:50] take time to say how there's
[1:03:52] a way that you should approach an elder
[1:03:54] but what is paul saying that elder
[1:03:56] is like a father to you and the younger
[1:03:58] men are like brothers to you
[1:04:00] treat the elder women as mothers treat
[1:04:03] the youngers
[1:04:04] as sisters with all purity it's
[1:04:07] it's paul actually saying those that you
[1:04:09] fellowship with those that are in this
[1:04:10] household of faith are to you
[1:04:12] the old elders are fathers to you treat
[1:04:14] them as such
[1:04:15] those that are younger they're brothers
[1:04:17] those that are aids the mothers the
[1:04:18] sisters and those we all look at one
[1:04:20] another as brother and sister
[1:04:22] and the true meaning of brother and
[1:04:24] sister children of god should not be
[1:04:25] lost in the repetition
[1:04:27] like the formality of because we so
[1:04:29] brother jeff or
[1:04:30] our brother randy we use these title
[1:04:32] brothers and people think well why do
[1:04:33] you and sometimes i think it sounds odd
[1:04:35] to people brother who
[1:04:37] or you say brother branham why do you
[1:04:38] call him brother brown so i'm just
[1:04:39] following the pattern of scripture where
[1:04:40] and they called him brother saul
[1:04:42] and they called one another in scripture
[1:04:43] they said brother they that was the way
[1:04:45] that they referred to one another
[1:04:46] and it ought not to be just a sign of
[1:04:48] respect in terms of saying mr mcgear or
[1:04:50] mr that or misses that
[1:04:52] but rather it should be a reminder to us
[1:04:54] that this is how i view you
[1:04:55] that in christ you are my brother in
[1:04:58] christ you are my sister
[1:04:59] and that in doing so it creates the
[1:05:01] feeling of family and promotes the
[1:05:02] virtues of family
[1:05:04] and creates obligations to one another
[1:05:05] as family
[1:05:08] through christ we can be the friends
[1:05:10] that stick closer than a brother
[1:05:12] through christ we can be those that
[1:05:13] stick closer than blood relation or
[1:05:15] relatives
[1:05:16] we can be the brother and the sister to
[1:05:18] one another that we need
[1:05:20] and maybe we don't have through the fl
[1:05:21] through the flesh
[1:05:25] now james chapter one
[1:05:38] verse 27 it says pure religion because
[1:05:42] if you if you think of it god has
[1:05:44] expressed what his nature is
[1:05:46] to be a father to the fatherless a judge
[1:05:48] of the widows he said at the solitarion
[1:05:50] families
[1:05:51] this is what god wants to do then we see
[1:05:54] that god has given us a church family
[1:05:56] so we can see how god uses these
[1:05:57] different things
[1:05:59] to meet these needs to satisfy these
[1:06:00] things and i'm having to go quickly
[1:06:02] and maybe not expanding on some of these
[1:06:04] as i would like to but now notice
[1:06:06] the duty that james imposes upon us as
[1:06:08] christians
[1:06:09] pure religion and undefiled before god
[1:06:12] and the father is this
[1:06:13] to visit the fatherless and the widows
[1:06:15] and their affliction
[1:06:16] and to keep himself unspotted from the
[1:06:18] world this is not an either or
[1:06:22] you're not choosing your religion here
[1:06:24] pure religion undefiled before god and
[1:06:26] the father
[1:06:27] is to is the and to visit the fatherless
[1:06:30] and the widows and their affliction
[1:06:31] and to keep himself unspotted from the
[1:06:33] world many can do a good job of
[1:06:35] appearing to be unspotted from the world
[1:06:37] but fail on the first point pure
[1:06:40] undefiled religion means sincere genuine
[1:06:42] not
[1:06:43] hypocritical actually makes reference to
[1:06:46] a diamond being free
[1:06:48] from any flaw or water being pure from
[1:06:50] any impurities
[1:06:51] that's what pure religion undefiled
[1:06:53] before god something that is genuine and
[1:06:56] free of flaws is manifested in visiting
[1:06:59] the fatherless and the widows and their
[1:07:00] affliction and keeping yourself
[1:07:02] unspotted from the world
[1:07:04] and this is not just ceremony where
[1:07:05] we're going to have a food banker we're
[1:07:06] going to do this or we're going to do
[1:07:07] that but james imposes
[1:07:09] a divine duty and the fulfillment of the
[1:07:12] gospel on these very things
[1:07:14] that if your religion is going to be
[1:07:15] pure and undefiled before god if you're
[1:07:17] going to be in the service of the gospel
[1:07:18] if you're going to satisfy
[1:07:20] the requirements of the christian church
[1:07:22] then you must visit the fatherless and
[1:07:24] the widows and their affliction
[1:07:26] in other words our religion our belief
[1:07:28] our convictions
[1:07:29] is made known by our acts of holiness in
[1:07:32] the way that we dress the way that we
[1:07:33] live keeping unspotted from the world
[1:07:35] but also in our acts of mercy
[1:07:36] how we treat those who are in need
[1:07:40] to visit the fatherless to visit the
[1:07:42] widows says in their affliction is to
[1:07:44] look after them to help them to care for
[1:07:46] them
[1:07:46] as paul would say do good unto all men
[1:07:49] especially those of the household of
[1:07:50] faith then there's a divine duty
[1:07:52] task the the the church member the
[1:07:54] church itself the local body
[1:07:56] us as christians have a responsibility
[1:07:58] to express
[1:07:59] this nature of god to visit the
[1:08:00] fatherless and the widows in their
[1:08:02] affliction
[1:08:05] to minister to those who are deprived of
[1:08:07] one of the most
[1:08:08] basic necessities of man are humankind
[1:08:12] companionship friendship provide those
[1:08:16] look after those who need it most
[1:08:20] and where they need it most
[1:08:23] he's saying visit the needy visit the
[1:08:25] afflicted but he refers to the
[1:08:26] fatherless and the widows why this is
[1:08:27] the nature of god
[1:08:31] i'm a father to the fathers i'm a
[1:08:32] defender of the widow so he tells us to
[1:08:34] visit them
[1:08:37] in their affliction isaiah chapter 1
[1:08:40] verse 17 learn to do well
[1:08:42] seek judgment we can like those first
[1:08:44] two right
[1:08:46] i want to learn and i want to i want to
[1:08:47] have a lot of opinions
[1:08:50] learn to do well seek righteousness
[1:08:51] relieve the oppressed
[1:08:54] judge the fatherless again that means
[1:08:56] defend them look after them
[1:08:57] plead for the widow to judge the
[1:09:00] fatherless is not to condemn them but
[1:09:02] actually to defend them to be the
[1:09:03] champion for them relieve the oppressed
[1:09:06] judge the fatherless plead for the widow
[1:09:08] this is a necessary admonishment why
[1:09:10] to resist the hurtful sinful tendencies
[1:09:12] we have from fallen flesh
[1:09:15] in the perfect family in the divine
[1:09:17] order in the beginning the masterpiece
[1:09:18] family
[1:09:19] these things would have been instinctive
[1:09:20] these things as adam even expressed and
[1:09:22] portrayed
[1:09:23] that this is something that he would
[1:09:24] have done instinctively but this is a
[1:09:26] necessary admonishment to resist these
[1:09:28] hurtful tendencies
[1:09:29] to judge to restrain to resist to not
[1:09:32] help
[1:09:33] because of the fall it's pride that
[1:09:36] enters in that causes these things it's
[1:09:38] insecurities it's bitterness there's
[1:09:40] histories there's all sorts of things
[1:09:41] that influence it but god is saying that
[1:09:43] we ought to relieve the oppressed judge
[1:09:44] the father's plead for the widows
[1:09:47] is is my emphasis on that is my
[1:09:49] instruction that we ought to do that
[1:09:50] this bible's
[1:09:51] plainly saying that we should but my
[1:09:54] point is to
[1:09:54] identify in scripture how that when god
[1:09:57] said it's not good for men to be alone
[1:09:59] these are all the reasons why god says
[1:10:01] these things that's why he says what he
[1:10:02] says in ecclesiastes that's why he says
[1:10:04] it in the book of proverbs in psalms
[1:10:06] in galatians and timothy in james and
[1:10:09] isaiah because it's not good for man to
[1:10:10] be alone
[1:10:15] god through these verses that we read in
[1:10:17] psalms and timothy and galatians and
[1:10:19] james isaiah
[1:10:20] he's taking great care to see that that
[1:10:22] vulnerability in mankind
[1:10:24] is not exploited
[1:10:27] it is not good for a man to be just by
[1:10:29] himself
[1:10:31] when god says that it's almost as if he
[1:10:32] exposes the most tender part of a man's
[1:10:34] heart
[1:10:37] a lot of things he could have said about
[1:10:38] man not being good about this or good
[1:10:40] about that but he says it's not good for
[1:10:41] man to be alone
[1:10:42] he identifies a vulnerability in a
[1:10:44] weakness that sometimes we're not
[1:10:45] willing to admit
[1:10:50] that's why loneliness hurts as much as
[1:10:52] it does
[1:10:54] that's why abandonment and rejection
[1:10:56] hurt as much as it does
[1:10:57] and let me say this that's why toxic
[1:10:59] relationships are even worse than having
[1:11:01] none
[1:11:03] because it it exploits that weakness and
[1:11:06] that vulnerability
[1:11:08] it takes advantage of that need
[1:11:15] the wounds of the abuse and alienation
[1:11:19] from family and
[1:11:21] the hurts that we experience from
[1:11:22] friendships can lead the deepest scars
[1:11:26] and i would say this that as christians
[1:11:29] as a church we must take great care that
[1:11:32] we not repeat the failures of some
[1:11:34] families
[1:11:39] brother brown says you know we need one
[1:11:40] another right now more than we ever did
[1:11:43] in all the history of the world is right
[1:11:45] now
[1:11:46] real royal believers we need each other
[1:11:51] this is another place where we're truly
[1:11:53] in the battle
[1:11:54] and we need each other more than we ever
[1:11:56] did in
[1:11:57] all times he says we need christians
[1:12:00] we need each other now more than ever
[1:12:04] that's what we need this is this is a
[1:12:06] need within us we have not matured to
[1:12:09] the state of independency from one
[1:12:10] another
[1:12:11] because what is our maturity marked by
[1:12:13] scripturally a greater dependence upon
[1:12:15] god
[1:12:16] i'm depending on him to fulfill his word
[1:12:18] from start to finish
[1:12:19] this must be an increasing
[1:12:21] characteristic inside of where i am
[1:12:23] dependent i'm not becoming more
[1:12:25] independent by virtue of my
[1:12:26] my revelation i'm not becoming more
[1:12:28] independent by virtue of my age and my
[1:12:29] experience
[1:12:30] but i realize the longer i live the more
[1:12:32] i need you the more we need each other
[1:12:34] the more mutually dependent we become on
[1:12:36] each other
[1:12:37] he said right now that's what we need we
[1:12:39] need christians we need real royal
[1:12:41] believers we need people
[1:12:42] who are not selfish we need people who
[1:12:44] are sacrificing
[1:12:45] we need people who are willing to love
[1:12:47] and willing to to lay aside differences
[1:12:49] and willing to embrace one another
[1:12:51] to see that things things can be done
[1:12:53] and accomplish where people need it
[1:12:58] i want to read the scripture again in
[1:12:59] closing it is not good
[1:13:02] genesis 2 18 it is not good that man
[1:13:05] should be alone
[1:13:06] i will make him a help meet for him
[1:13:10] a help meet one that complemented him
[1:13:16] one he identified with complimented him
[1:13:19] sure adam you look good today
[1:13:23] right but just one that was
[1:13:26] was aided him was fit for his purpose
[1:13:29] and his use and the job that he had
[1:13:32] someone he identified with bone of my
[1:13:34] bone flesh of my flesh someone he was
[1:13:35] connected to someone that understood him
[1:13:38] and this need still res exists within us
[1:13:42] and it's a need that cannot be satisfied
[1:13:44] by mere company with people
[1:13:48] it's a need for something genuine that's
[1:13:51] why god said
[1:13:52] i'm going to give you a help meet
[1:13:56] and if i could say it in this way and
[1:13:59] try to find a
[1:14:00] find just the right way to say it
[1:14:03] god designed that need
[1:14:06] when he looked at man and said it's not
[1:14:08] good for man to be alone
[1:14:10] god made him that way
[1:14:14] god made adam with this longing to be
[1:14:17] loved
[1:14:18] god made man with this longing for
[1:14:20] companionship this longing to be
[1:14:22] understood
[1:14:23] god made that desire inside of you to
[1:14:25] belong the need to feel loved you're
[1:14:27] craving for acceptance
[1:14:28] god made that desire
[1:14:32] can we acknowledge that we have it to
[1:14:34] some varying degree some may be more
[1:14:35] than others but could we all admit that
[1:14:37] deep down inside of us
[1:14:38] that if i'm using the wrong language to
[1:14:40] describe it is there something that you
[1:14:41] as an intelligent person can say
[1:14:43] he may not be saying exactly the way
[1:14:45] that i would say but yes
[1:14:46] something's being identified deep inside
[1:14:48] my person some shock that still resides
[1:14:50] within me as a man or a woman a boy or a
[1:14:52] girl
[1:14:53] i have that need god
[1:14:56] made that need and having created that
[1:14:59] need in mankind
[1:15:00] he's the one that knows how to meet it
[1:15:04] and he's mindful of that need
[1:15:08] and i would want that to be the take
[1:15:10] home
[1:15:11] through all these scriptures i've read
[1:15:12] is god has allowed the bible to be
[1:15:14] written in such a way
[1:15:16] by the inspiration of god that we can
[1:15:18] kind of take it in this context we place
[1:15:20] it in today say look
[1:15:21] god knows my human condition god knows
[1:15:24] what i'm going through god knows how i
[1:15:26] feel god knows how i'm
[1:15:27] i when i what i'm thinking what i'm
[1:15:29] acting god knows what these things feel
[1:15:30] like
[1:15:31] and he's mindful of these things
[1:15:36] this very need life has a way of
[1:15:37] perverting that life has a way of
[1:15:38] creating complexes and
[1:15:40] certain things happen to cause us to
[1:15:41] hold back from making true relationships
[1:15:43] and we're reluctant to form new bonds
[1:15:45] we're reluctant to trust again we're
[1:15:47] reluctant to test
[1:15:48] to take a step forward and be a part of
[1:15:50] something because of things that have
[1:15:52] happened before
[1:15:52] and that's something that god's going to
[1:15:54] have to resolve in your heart because he
[1:15:56] wants you to fit in he wants you to
[1:15:57] belong
[1:15:58] he wants you to have true proper healthy
[1:16:00] relationships
[1:16:02] because god looks at you and i can say
[1:16:04] this in john chapter 14 verse
[1:16:06] 18 he can look at you no matter where
[1:16:08] you are right now he says i will not
[1:16:09] leave you comfortless
[1:16:10] i will come to you comfortless is the
[1:16:14] word that means bereft of parents bereft
[1:16:15] of a father fatherless i will not leave
[1:16:17] you without this kind of relationship
[1:16:19] i will come to you
[1:16:25] i will come to you
[1:16:32] if you could just bow your heads for a
[1:16:33] moment
[1:16:35] all right let's just stand to our feet
[1:16:49] it is not good that the man
[1:16:53] should be alone
[1:16:57] so i'll give him somebody for him and
[1:17:02] then god repeats it to
[1:17:03] jacob abraham and constantly throughout
[1:17:06] scripture
[1:17:07] i won't leave you until i've
[1:17:08] accomplished what i've said
[1:17:12] it's said in the old testament it said
[1:17:13] in the new testament i'll never leave
[1:17:14] you nor forsake you
[1:17:16] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:17:20] come to you
[1:17:24] there's a part of us that may even feel
[1:17:26] as if
[1:17:30] there's none that can relate as a young
[1:17:33] man
[1:17:34] i remember before i served the lord
[1:17:38] my emotional struggles and the things i
[1:17:41] felt the things i experienced
[1:17:43] that when i began to serve god there was
[1:17:44] a scripture that god made alive to me
[1:17:48] by revelation that gave me great comfort
[1:17:51] so when jesus was hanging on the cross
[1:17:55] there's the man alone again
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] adam in the beginning was a man who
[1:18:01] dwelt alone
[1:18:04] now christ misunderstood crucified not
[1:18:07] even fully understood by his disciples
[1:18:10] even as he sat there on the cross die
[1:18:12] and he's saying
[1:18:13] behold thy mother behold thy son and
[1:18:15] joining families together and causing
[1:18:17] those to be united
[1:18:18] being rejected by one on his uh uh to
[1:18:21] his left and just the persecution and
[1:18:23] the suffering rejected by those that he
[1:18:24] came to and
[1:18:25] as if the hurt wasn't bad enough then
[1:18:28] darkness was felt over the face of the
[1:18:30] earth
[1:18:32] from noon to three o'clock it says there
[1:18:34] was darkness upon all the land
[1:18:37] and we know by what jesus cried and
[1:18:39] expressed that this was
[1:18:40] symbolic of god turning his back on his
[1:18:43] son
[1:18:45] and could you imagine jesus even at 12
[1:18:48] years old say i must be about my
[1:18:50] father's business
[1:18:51] and that communion he had with the
[1:18:53] father well i only do
[1:18:55] i only do what the father tells me to do
[1:18:58] i only say
[1:18:59] what the father tells me to say in some
[1:19:02] 33 years of life he always had this
[1:19:05] consciousness
[1:19:06] of the father the father the father
[1:19:10] in obedience to the father's will he
[1:19:12] takes this cross and carries it to
[1:19:14] golgotha and he's there
[1:19:15] hammered to a cross and bleeding out and
[1:19:17] dying
[1:19:20] still crying out to the father but then
[1:19:23] darkness covers the earth and god whose
[1:19:25] characteristic is light
[1:19:27] god forsakes them god turns his back on
[1:19:32] him
[1:19:33] and he cries my god my god why hast thou
[1:19:37] forsaken me we're not guessing just at
[1:19:40] the darkness what it meant we know by
[1:19:42] the fact that jesus christ cries it out
[1:19:44] deep within himself i have been forsaken
[1:19:46] by god god my father why
[1:19:49] why have you turned your back on me you
[1:19:51] think my what an
[1:19:52] instance what a moment and the picture
[1:19:54] we see is once again the man the second
[1:19:56] adam
[1:19:57] is all alone and why
[1:20:00] why would god do such a thing why would
[1:20:02] god bear this
[1:20:03] why would god do this he did it so that
[1:20:05] you and i
[1:20:06] in the atonement would have something
[1:20:09] that meets our rejection
[1:20:11] something that would meet our loneliness
[1:20:13] something that would atone for our hurts
[1:20:14] and our pains
[1:20:15] at the hands of others and he say i can
[1:20:18] be touched by the feeling of your
[1:20:19] infirmities
[1:20:20] i have felt forsaken i have felt the
[1:20:22] love of the father turned away from me
[1:20:24] and i bored that for you on the cross
[1:20:27] that you could look to me
[1:20:30] and you could come to me and i'll do the
[1:20:32] rest
[1:20:36] [Music]
[1:20:45] it's so deep within god's nature for you
[1:20:49] to feel this
[1:20:52] that through his son he atoned for
[1:20:54] rejection
[1:20:57] where's my atonement where's my relief
[1:20:58] where's my redemption
[1:21:00] there on the cross that day he paid the
[1:21:03] price for it
[1:21:05] so that you wouldn't have to live with
[1:21:06] it forever
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] the bible matthew chapter 18
[1:21:13] he's talking about little ones he says
[1:21:15] if a man had a hundred
[1:21:16] sheep and one of them went astray does
[1:21:20] the shepherd not leave the ninety and
[1:21:22] nine
[1:21:23] and go into the mountains and seek the
[1:21:24] one that went astray
[1:21:26] why does he do that he's not hung up on
[1:21:29] hundreds
[1:21:31] right it's not the number
[1:21:35] of a hundred why did he do it because
[1:21:37] the number one
[1:21:41] it was enough that it was just one
[1:21:45] the thought of one being alone in the
[1:21:47] mountains the one thought of one being
[1:21:48] vulnerable the thought of one not being
[1:21:50] a part of the fold
[1:21:51] was enough to cause the shepherd to go
[1:21:54] after him
[1:21:57] and he said if it be so that he find it
[1:21:59] verily i send you he rejoiceth more of
[1:22:01] that sheep
[1:22:02] than of the 99 which went astr not
[1:22:04] astray
[1:22:05] there's an old hymn that's written are
[1:22:07] the 99 not enough
[1:22:09] why is it you would have to go and chase
[1:22:11] after the one
[1:22:13] because god says it's not good for that
[1:22:15] one to be alone
[1:22:18] it's not enough that i have 99 and know
[1:22:20] that there's one
[1:22:21] who's all alone
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:26] that's the nature of god that's the
[1:22:28] instinct of god i want to make the
[1:22:30] invitation to you today
[1:22:32] to come to him
[1:22:35] and in in your in your weakness and your
[1:22:37] vulnerability
[1:22:38] even in your hurts of rejections past
[1:22:42] and ask god to begin to heal and to
[1:22:45] satisfy
[1:22:46] that you might find your contentment
[1:22:48] within him
[1:22:50] so that you can fully enjoy the
[1:22:53] relationships he's given you
[1:22:55] to satisfy that need deep inside of you
[1:22:58] some of us have been unable to be
[1:23:00] satisfied in the very relationships he's
[1:23:01] given us
[1:23:02] because we still hold on to the pain of
[1:23:04] rejection deep within
[1:23:06] our past and we still build walls even
[1:23:08] with spouses even with people that love
[1:23:09] us
[1:23:09] even with people that are reaching out
[1:23:11] their hands to help us we still look
[1:23:13] back to things that have happened in our
[1:23:14] past
[1:23:15] and we're unwilling to take a step
[1:23:16] forward so i'm not the one holding my
[1:23:18] hand i'll say hey trust me trust me as
[1:23:20] your friend trust me as a minister trust
[1:23:22] me as a man of god i'm saying come to
[1:23:24] him
[1:23:25] let him do the rest just come to him and
[1:23:28] let him look out after you let him care
[1:23:30] for you
[1:23:30] let him work on your needs let him
[1:23:32] reveal himself to you as a father
[1:23:34] let him reveal himself to you as a
[1:23:35] husband let him reveal himself to you as
[1:23:37] a friend
[1:23:38] as the comforter and then by trusting
[1:23:41] him
[1:23:42] and seeing he'll fulfill his promises
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:47] they can make you to be that sister and
[1:23:50] that brother
[1:23:52] that others need
[1:23:55] we were having dinner here recently and
[1:23:59] with some some friends
[1:24:03] and it was the course of the
[1:24:05] conversation i don't exactly remember
[1:24:07] but i can still just remember the moment
[1:24:10] and it was sister nicole that said it
[1:24:11] and she was speaking i believe just
[1:24:13] about
[1:24:14] the the of of a believer and a christian
[1:24:17] and she said it's like the it's like
[1:24:19] that statue of liberty that's
[1:24:21] the the same that's inscribed on the
[1:24:23] statue of liberty
[1:24:24] it's called the a poem was written
[1:24:28] sonnet was written the new colossus was
[1:24:32] the name of it
[1:24:34] and this lady liberty was called the
[1:24:36] mother of exiles
[1:24:39] the scattered the rejected
[1:24:42] those who no longer felt at home in what
[1:24:44] was called their home country
[1:24:47] who went seeking for a better place
[1:24:51] and the inscription closes with this
[1:24:53] keep ancient land your storied pomp
[1:24:57] christ she with silent lips give me your
[1:25:01] tired
[1:25:02] your poor your huddled masses yearning
[1:25:04] to breathe free
[1:25:05] the wretched refuse of your teeming
[1:25:07] shore send these the homeless temptest
[1:25:10] lost
[1:25:10] tossed to me i lift my lamp beside
[1:25:13] the golden door i say that's what i want
[1:25:17] to do today is to lift this up
[1:25:19] christ stands come unto me all you are
[1:25:21] burdened and heavy laden
[1:25:23] and i'll give you rest i will not leave
[1:25:25] you comfortless
[1:25:26] and i desire that as god has raised up a
[1:25:29] new church may we not be a new colossus
[1:25:31] but may we become a sister of exiles may
[1:25:34] we be those who can point to
[1:25:35] liberty in christ jesus and say you can
[1:25:38] keep your story pumped but give me your
[1:25:40] tired your poor
[1:25:41] your huddled masses yearning to breathe
[1:25:43] free the wretched refuse of your teeming
[1:25:46] shore
[1:25:46] sinned the homeless and the tempest
[1:25:48] tossed we'll take them
[1:25:51] we'll take them if you have a caste
[1:25:54] system
[1:25:55] we'll take the lowest cast
[1:25:58] if you have those that are no longer
[1:26:00] desirable we'll welcome them why
[1:26:02] we believe in a god who can we believe
[1:26:04] in a word that is powerful
[1:26:05] we believe in a healer we believe in a
[1:26:07] deliverer we believe a god that is
[1:26:08] greater than any spirit any change that
[1:26:11] bind
[1:26:13] i'm not afraid of a circumstance i may
[1:26:15] not have the wisdom for it i may not
[1:26:17] have the understanding i may not be able
[1:26:18] to answer all of your questions
[1:26:20] my goodness the things that we're facing
[1:26:21] today are so complex
[1:26:23] that they're the complexities of them
[1:26:24] the complications of them we don't have
[1:26:26] all the answers but i thank god we have
[1:26:28] one
[1:26:30] who is the answer
[1:26:33] who could make so much sense of life to
[1:26:34] where the question's irrelevant
[1:26:37] give us so much purpose and belonging
[1:26:39] that the very thing we crave for the
[1:26:41] very thing we long for the very thing
[1:26:43] that we thought mattered the most in
[1:26:44] life through him it now finally has
[1:26:46] perspective and relevance and we just
[1:26:47] relax we say lord i love you this is
[1:26:49] great
[1:26:53] and so i i share these things so that
[1:26:55] you understand there's an
[1:26:56] almighty god it says the lord god said
[1:27:00] your jehovah elohim said i know
[1:27:04] it's not good that you're alone
[1:27:07] so i know you've had your heads bowed
[1:27:10] would there be a hand that would want to
[1:27:11] raise and say lord i'm coming home
[1:27:13] to where i belong i'm just coming to you
[1:27:17] today lord
[1:27:19] our gracious heavenly father
[1:27:22] lord it's
[1:27:28] it's not an emotional trick of a public
[1:27:31] speaker
[1:27:33] to take something that is common to
[1:27:35] everyone who stands here today
[1:27:38] and begin to speak on it in such a way
[1:27:40] to conjure up emotions and feelings and
[1:27:43] sentiments to only
[1:27:44] capitalize on them in the end
[1:27:48] but lord it was you
[1:27:51] it was you today that cut away layers
[1:27:55] and scars and complexes
[1:27:58] and got right down way deep in our
[1:28:00] hearts and said the reason you
[1:28:01] feel the way you do is because i made
[1:28:04] you with a need
[1:28:06] and that need has been misused and
[1:28:09] manipulated and abused and deep inside
[1:28:11] you i made you that way
[1:28:14] and the misuse of it has caused these
[1:28:17] things
[1:28:19] but i stand as one today he expresses
[1:28:22] this god expressed this you expressed
[1:28:24] this lord
[1:28:25] it is not good that man should be alone
[1:28:28] i will make for him
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:32] a help meet for him
[1:28:35] today lord we come to you
[1:28:39] with our scars and our wounds our
[1:28:41] complexes and our fears
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] our misunderstandings of yesterday and
[1:28:48] our questions of tomorrow we stand
[1:28:50] before you we say
[1:28:52] lord i accept you as the comforter
[1:28:57] as the father as the right ruler and
[1:29:00] champion friend
[1:29:03] i'll find my friendship this longing
[1:29:06] lord i will find that it begins to be
[1:29:08] satisfied
[1:29:10] in this step of coming to you
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:14] and saying lord this is a need that
[1:29:16] transcends my natural abilities this is
[1:29:18] a need that transcends
[1:29:19] my nature as being a mcgeary lord this
[1:29:22] is a need that you placed in me as a
[1:29:24] human being and i said god you alone
[1:29:26] know how to fulfill it
[1:29:28] you alone know how to heal it and i
[1:29:31] surrender myself to you today
[1:29:35] and lord his hands are raised if we
[1:29:37] can't even understand what it means we
[1:29:39] don't even
[1:29:40] know what it represents and and just
[1:29:43] exactly
[1:29:44] what i'm doing but lord i feel i'm
[1:29:46] taking a step to you today
[1:29:48] as someone real someone mindful
[1:29:51] may that be the step that's taken lord i
[1:29:54] could just take this one step
[1:29:56] and may you lord as being expressed as
[1:29:59] that father the prodigal
[1:30:00] may you come running lord to the hurting
[1:30:03] to the lost
[1:30:04] to the huddled masses lord may you come
[1:30:08] running
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:10] and meet these needs that we have lord
[1:30:13] may we take this understanding to better
[1:30:16] relate to those who are amongst us the
[1:30:17] hurts that people feel the way that
[1:30:19] people sometimes develop a
[1:30:23] an exterior lord and an uprightness and
[1:30:26] shoulders back and a real sternness
[1:30:28] because they've had to learn to fend for
[1:30:30] themselves
[1:30:32] they've had to learn to speak up for
[1:30:34] themselves they had to learn to stand on
[1:30:35] their own two feet
[1:30:38] lord i pray that you give us a grace to
[1:30:40] get beneath
[1:30:42] those who don't even know they need help
[1:30:45] so that we can help them
[1:30:48] may we be this light by the golden door
[1:30:54] welcoming your children home i commit us
[1:30:57] as a church to you these people to you
[1:30:59] with hands raised and hearts open in the
[1:31:02] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:31:04] amen
