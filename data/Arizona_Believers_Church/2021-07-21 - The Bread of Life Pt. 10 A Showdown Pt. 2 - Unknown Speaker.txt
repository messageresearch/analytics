TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ruth chapter one we'll start with verse 15 and then read to verse 18. and she said behold this is naomi speaking behold thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people and unto her gods and that's a kind of important phrasing there return thou after thy sister-in-law and the ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee in me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her you can be seated and she saw that she was steadfastly minded she let the conversation end and let it go last time we spoke on a showdown i'm just going to use a few statements here at the outset to um kind of collect where we were at that time and even kind of picking up over the last several services in the showdown ruth is facing her condition even in some ways the condition she's currently in her her expectations her idol worship her upbringing her nature and her nurture and so she's facing her condition and then she's also facing her opposition as she comes to bethlehem she's not there yet she's at this critical juncture where she's nearing that and even if some people look at the story she may have been just right at that borderline and so she's facing her condition she's facing her opposition in what brother branham called a showdown he said this was a showdown for ruth and so orpah as we looked at her last time she walks in the steps of lot's wife now that we saw before in genesis 19 that lot's wife started out as an overcomer she was that borderline believer that make believer she came so far and then turned around and went back and this is the this is in the lineage this is in the nature of moab and here orpah in the nature of her father and the nature of her her mother so to speak she takes that step back and she goes back into moab which was her homeland and then she's orpha's walking in the image of the prophecy of remember lot's wife in luke chapter 17 verse 32 that in the time that the son of man is being revealed there is going to be a turning back those that turn back and go back we see that orpah walks into that uh walks in that pattern but it's not satisfactory to identify orpah because we don't identify with her at all we might feel that we can see that nature and we can see that instinct but who we identify with is ruth and ruth begins to walk in the steps of not lot's wife but sarah how sarah was there with abraham she stayed with her husband and and who is that father of faith and how she she was there with the promise of her own and so ruth is walking in the steps of sarah or the faith of abraham and she also portrays those who are captured by the faith of the son of man in luke 17 30. so there's this process that's unfolding we see orpah go one way we see ruth going another brother bran mccall did a showdown we read this statement a few services ago services ago and what was the holy ghost given for and it says orpha she said that she would return back to her country to her gods and to her church and to her people but the band used a very strong language she kissed christ goodbye she kissed the message goodbye and naomi tried to get ruth to go back but she said your people are my people your god is my god where you die there i'll die where you're buried there i'll be buried and i will not turn back and he uses this phrase this is kind of what caught me that's when a person's caught a vision so there's something that ruth is catching there's something that's very deep inside of her and i want to express that it wasn't in technicolor at the time it wasn't perfect and she didn't say oh i just know there's a really rich man i'm going to marry and and bethlehem judas so everything's going to work out it wasn't that everything was just spelled out perfectly in this in this instance but she something was drawing her something very deep and and what i'm wanting to come to once we get into ruth chapter 2 is how that we could see that there was this unfolding of this revelation though ruth is walking in this promise and ruth is coming to bethlehem judah and ruth is going to of necessity begin to glean and there's provision and there's inspiration there's faith that's guiding her there it leads to this point and i'm not trying to hide this at all but this is really what i have as my vision to come to and speak about is how that one day in this process the revelation comes to her that this is more than just you know a place to live and a place to eat this is your kinsman redeemer this is salvation this is christ and we have the similar experience in the message of the hour we come to it we begin to fellowship in it the word begins to open to us but then there comes a time when revelations begin to break and unfold like wow i just thought it was different or i just thought it was another way of doing this or i thought god had just sent a prophet but then you begin to see the scriptures that are being fulfilled and it completely changes the whole your whole perception of what god had been doing from the moment you begin to leave moab and so at the time that ruth is in this place of saying i'll i'll go where you go and how large were you large she's caught a vision and and it's not perfectly spelled out to her to where naomi said now go back but if you don't i can find you a husband under according to our law in israel that wasn't the promise but something was anchoring deep inside of her and so that's a person who's caught a vision don't make any difference what her people said you're going over there becoming a holy roller or something that didn't make any difference to ruth there was a purpose of god to be fulfilled and so it's something deep inside of our faith that begins to rise up it's a revealing of the son of man for us it was a faith that began to swell up for her even if she didn't know exactly at the time what it was so in giving when brother banham uses the phrase the phrase and and i didn't go back and use these uh quotations and maybe i would have had time to do it but i just wanted to make reference very quickly how brother brown called this a showdown it became a showdown for ruth and showdown when i began to look at the etymology of it where the phrase began i couldn't find anywhere where it had a use or reference other than that its origin was in it was slang for laying your cards down face up and it came a time in this in playing cards or poker that there was and we don't endorse those things uh but that you would come to a point where there would be a showdown and everyone has to lay their cards face up and everyone knows then what hand you're holding and that becomes kind of like what they call a final confrontation uh the games are over and you can't you can't bluff anymore and you can't pretend i don't have a good hand or you can't be you know bluffing uh that you're that you have a good one but you have a poor one everyone lays their things out in front and so it was slang for laying your cards out face up for everyone to see and then it kind of turned into this idea of a confrontation a final confrontation something that's going to end that play or that hand and so now we use the phrase showdown as a test or a confrontation that's meant to settle a matter if it's coming to a showdown it's like things are going to be decided now things are going to come to their coming to a head so it's an event that forces an issue to its conclusion that when it comes to this point it's a showdown so it's a test that's meant to settle a matter a confrontation that is uh intended to conclude something it's an issue an event that forces an issue to its conclusion it's an act that brings matters to a head or acts as a conclusion so this is a showdown now when we say a showdown we're we're wanting to kind of give this understanding things unfold and there's other junctures and there's other things that transpire but this becomes kind of a dividing point between moab and bethlehem judah it's at this point that ruth is going to begin to enter into a journey and a process that ends in her bringing forth a son that's in the lineage of jesus christ and so this is the like a watershed moment this is a showdown where ruth is separating herself and it's this climactic event at this point it's an act that brings a matter to a head it is uh it is a test that settles this matter for ruth because now at this point there's no going back seemed like it for orpha maybe she had crossed that across the rubicon so to speak and she had had this moment where now there's no turning back you've got to go forward but she she she went back but for ruth there's going to come a showdown and so i want you to kind of imagine this we're at the border now we're at the borderline we're near this crossing over between the promise and moab that's where we are tonight because we just we had read before how orpah kissed her mother-in-law we're at this borderline orpah kisses her mother-in-law and she goes back and now orpah fades into obscurity right she's excommunicated she's never mentioned anymore uh even though it's kind of the language that we see in the message that she's no longer the church is no longer a mouthpiece uh even we see the insignificance a lot entering into insignificance so orp is fading off the scene if we could just view this as a transition in this great story this drama orpah fades away and now the story is going to focus solely on ruth you say well there was a limoulic and there was his two sons and naomi and then there was uh then elimelech gone and it's naomi and her two sons who married these two girls and you find the story is narrowing down it's at this point that we should realize it's not so much about naomi it's about ruth the focus begins to zero in on ruth and so ruth comes to a showdown she comes to a place of deciding and i know you're all message students so you're familiar with how brother branham identifies that there was four stages or even phases i think is a word that he uses of ruth there's ruth deciding serving ruth resting and ruth rewarded and i think even maybe scofield may bring that out in his headings in a schofield bible that you have you have ruth deciding and then once she makes her decision you have ruth serving and then once she serves she's she's resting on the promise of boaz and then there's the reward and brother ma'am actually uses those different uh stages or phases in different ways how ruth deciding is justification ruth serving his sanctification ruth resting is the baptism of the holy ghost and so these things don't become real hard and fast doctrines like no this is what it is brother branham we'll use them in different ways about the decision about the rest and the reward but we can just see these types in this great drama and this story that's unfolding in the book of ruth and so there is ruth that is deciding and that's kind of the point that this showdown comes in she's she's deciding and in revelations chapter 5 part 1 when brother branham is preaching the church ages he says ruth deciding she was deciding whether she would make the decision or not to go back into the homeland just like the church and so that i don't have this the quotation for you on a slide but ruth is deciding and he says she's deciding whether she would make the decision to go or to stay to go back into homeland to go with naomi and he says to go back into the homeland so what is that going back into her comforts going back to her church going back to her way of thinking going back to her god as as as the bible says she's naomi says she's gone back to her people she's gone back to to her gods is what she's familiar with what she's comfortable with she's gone to a place that she knows that she can she can exist and she can get by and he says just like the church so there's that again that overlay of orpah representing the church but ruth now is representing the bride and she comes to a show now where she has to decide and now is we know what she says and we'll read it here in a moment in ruth chapter one but as you as we find ruth on this borderline to leave moab and and where she was in the land now to cross back over jordan to the promised land i want you to catch a parallel of the children of israel in the book of joshua chapter 24 where where joshua is now commanding them uh uh they're they're now being settled they're being established they're going to find themselves in this promised land and just how uh joshua challenges the people and i want you to use this because i know you're very familiar with the scripture reading i want to use it as so just to see the symmetry between what ruth actually says to naomi and what joshua says to the people in in joshua 24. now this is a very familiar scripture to all of us in verse 14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt so now he's referencing this other land this other time this other period and how there's been a there's a decision that's happened this watershed moment this transition into the promised land and now make a choice are you going to serve god in the promised land or are you going to go back to the way you lived and believed before and he says if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve so he's this is the decision this is israel deciding if we had israel deciding so that they can they can enter to this promise and enter into their rest he says choose you this day whom you'll serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell and this language caught me because what was that last bit of land that israel had found themselves in before they crossed over the land of the amorites which the king of the amorites had taken from who moab and so there's this parallel he's saying do you want to go back to serve the gods of the amorites you want to go back to serve the gods of the moabites do you want to go back to what we've just come out of and on the other side of the river on the other side of the flood you want to go back to be moabites and amorites and serve these other gods he says but as for me and my house we will serve the lord we've sung it we believe it we it's one of those things that are we we do in a very uh a shabby chic font with a nice uh barn wood background and we put it on above our couch in our living room right as for me and my house will serve the lord it's very very well known scripture but this is something very very profound something very sober and he says that's for me and my family that's what he means we're going to serve the lord we have a choice to make we can be like the world we can serve the world we can continue in our ways of thinking and our ways of living our ways of raising our ways of processing things but we've come to a point we've got to decide i'm going all the way with the lord i'm not going to stay the way that i've been i i'm going to serve god and i'm going to serve him holy with my whole heart and when we say as for me and my house i'll serve the lord let's not just think in some terms of the confession that jesus christ is my savior and i have a walk with god and it's some sort of cliche that we can just merely feel by checking the box on a few different disciplines that we can do and going to church and believing in jesus christ it's more to it than that so he says whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the lord verse 16 and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other other gods and notice what their response is because joshua's bringing him to a showdown to a decision serve god or go back to egypt serve god or go back to the land of the amorite serve god or go back on the other side of the flood serve god now in the present truth or go back to the way things were before and they say oh god forbid that we forsake the lord to serve other gods for the lord verse 17 the lord is our god the lord for the lord our god they say for the lord our god he is that brought us up here it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land this is even regards to those that would have dwelt within the promised land so you see there's a driving away of moab there's a driving away of the amorites it's god that has done this therefore we will serve the lord he is our god giving you're saying hey it's god that's done this this has been the promise of the lord he is our god in an answer to joshua's challenge they're like nay we will not forsake him. now it's interesting because in the book of ruth or you know orpah uh kisses her mother-in-law and says goodbye but what did ruth do she claimed to naomi so then in this scene you kind of see how joshua challenges them oh why don't you go back go back to your other gods naomi saying go back to your country and you'll find new husbands and you'll find children and you'll be comforted and you'll be successful and orpa says all right fine see you later and ruth cleaves to naomi and then this is the people now they say no we will not forsake our god but then notice what joshua says and i feel that it's so close to verse 15 and that she says oh your sister-in-law has gone back why don't you go back also joshua said to the people you cannot serve the lord for he is a holy god that's quite a statement he says you can't do it he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he have done you good this is prophecy because we know this is exactly what happens but they're challenged kind of rebuffed well why don't you go back why don't you go back like orpah did and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord now what joshua was doing he was bringing them to make a very conscious and deliberate decision it wasn't like hey this is great here we are let's make this work but he wanted them to make a very deliberate and conscious decision in that they had to disavow their formal ways of doing things they had to even acknowledge that there was some idolatry that they had brought with them certain things they'd picked up certain habits and certain ways of viewing things and certain ways of believing in certain ways they felt things should be done and there'd been kind of a mixing of the amorites and moabites and these different ideologies and bailism into into their thought process and into their worship and into their home and so he wanted to bring the very very conscious decision that wait a minute here we are in the message of the hour here we are serving god in the present truth and i've got to i can't mix i can't mingle i can't be divided i need to make a very a clear-cut decision a very conscious decision about what i'm doing very alert and aware of these things that are taking place around me and it's got to be a deliberate choice now to serve god and forsake everything else and that's what joshua's challenging to do and that's exactly what they did and brother branham this is just a quick statement i'll share with you from the message why little bethlehem and if you've been kind of jotting down these notes and paying attention uh maybe to these titles you'll find i'm quoting a lot from just a few sermons because brother graham doesn't talk about ruth a lot and we've just been reading in those places where he preaches on ruth and it's very easy to just look over those sermons in total and not be constantly having to search because it's very just very few places where he focuses in on this and the message why little bethlehem he says that's what god wants it's not that borderline halfway but an absolute full surrender to the kingdom of god he's making reference to ruth's decision he says that's what god wants it's not borderline it's not halfway but it's an absolute full surrender to the kingdom of god this is what joshua was calling the people to do hey you're in the promised land now but are you going to serve the gods from the other side of the flood or will you let this become the habitation of the lord to holy follow him and to cling to him and to only serve him and so there's this parallel i trust that you're kind of seeing that this parallel between the decision that joshua brings the people to and the decision that ruth is making and let's just read it very quickly again in verses 15 to 18 notice how well this parallels with the people's response joshua's challenge and the people's response and she said behold my sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law you cannot serve the lord he's a holy god you're not going to be able to do it and why don't you just go back and serve the gods on the other side of the flood and if you think it's evil then just turn back go back and she says and i want to read it all and then break it down entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for wither thou goest i will go on where thou largest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god as the people said we will serve the lord and he is our god there's one god will serve him he's the lord verse 17 where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part v and me when she's and so this is her that's the great declaration of ruth as we've mentioned several times are very familiar it becomes now a vow that's being made from ruth to naomi it's a vow that's expressed in marriage vows that there's this union that's taking place and and it's used in that context because the language is so beautiful and it speaks of a commitment but i want to slow down a little bit tonight and ponder what she's actually saying and what she's vowing to do because you could just take anyone that says to somebody wherever you go i'll go whatever you do i'll do wherever you sleep i'll sleep and you say wow that's quite a commitment and what have you signed yourself up to do go wherever they go do whatever they do die wherever they die and you can ponder that a little bit and say well you would only make that promise to certain people or into in a particular situation and really realize i could only make that vow to the lord i could only make that vow to christ he's the only one that i can follow unreservedly he's the only one that i could commit to without without any inhibitions and so it may be used in this marital without context but i want you to think that even in that contest even in that situation it has a greater context as to why you can make that vow why you would even express those things and so then naomi recognizing that this declaration of ruth and when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her now we've read it twice now and i want to read it a third time but this time i want to slow down and i want to go statement by statement and if you're thinking oh great how many months is that going to take you to do since it took us forever to get out of ruth chapter verse 1 chapter 1 verse 1. it's i think i can do it tonight i'm going to do it tonight but i want to look at in a particular way by taking it from a translation and it's from the targum translation where that is actually target it means translation or interpretation and it's a it's a translation of the hebrew bible into aramaic and so they took the the the hebrew bible and the and the different uh uh the penthouse and these different writings and the hebrew writings the things that made up their scrolls and their law and made up the hebrew bible as we call it these hebrew writings that were so precious to judaism and to the jews it had been once the jews were exiled into babylon they all began to speak aramaic and for a lot of them they couldn't read the hebrew bible they had actually lost their language in the language of their fathers and they and so it was necessary after the babylonian exile and bondage to the chaldeans and different ones that the the bible was translated from hebrew into a more common language that they could understand and we realized we're even taught that jesus probably would have spoke aramaic and that and so there's a different language that's being spoken amongst the jews and so they took the old writings in hebrew and they translated them into what's called the targum or the interpretation which is an aramic translation of the hebrew text and what's unique about it is it's not just a literal translation that with the king james bible they're taking the hebrew they're taking the greek and it becomes a literal word for word translation but in many of the places in the targum it contains interpretation uh um and explanatory notes that even as you're reading it it could say uh even in the in the book of ruth it says that the two that mahlon and kulian took to them wives of of moab contrary to the law that was given to them in marriage and it actually breaks down what law they're they're they're uh violating in uh in the way that it's being transferred so it gives these explanatory notes and these interpretations and i'm going to read it from the targum because it's it interprets these this verse that we read here verses 16 and 17 and it interprets it and breaks it down into a conversation and brother branham in the message redeemer redemption says talks about the story of redemption in ruth and he uses the phrase that it gives out the very lines of redemption and so what struck me is that it became it became like a screenplay or a play like a play and a drama and so i went ahead and i just created a script and actually says a showdown presented by arizona believers church i couldn't say it was by me i did i didn't write i didn't write the book of ruth i didn't translate the targum and so i've actually laid it out uh and sister elizabeth asked me if we were gonna have people acted out tonight i said no i wish i had thought of that ahead of time it could have could have made this a lot of fun but it's like a script because i've broken it down using this translation into a script and so in looking at it this way and looking at as a script and looking as like a screenplay or a play that's being dramatized the very lines of redemption says the lines redemption it's like a story you have a character that says something a dialogue a screenplay in different events and you have the narration it gives out the very lines of redemption in this story of redemption and in looking at it this way as a conversation it helps us to understand really what ruth was deciding because it's not ah well i guess i've gone this far i don't want to be without you naomi there's something that unfolds in this conversation to me that's very very beautiful and it reveals just how deep the conversation is so we'll set the scene now it fades in and we're looking at a showdown and so here and i've kind of set it up to it looks just like it would if you were handed a script and i wish maybe brother travis was here to kind of clean it up beforehand as him sure he knows how to put together a script a lot better than me but now it says this this scene opens and i don't have it written in front of me when i do actually i have the original script i'll autograph it for anybody who'd like a copy orpa has turned back to moab so we're just setting the scene again and naomi's told ruth to do the same now that's our that's to say this is a showdown we're fading into this showdown and here's here's how it goes from here and ruth says do not urge me to leave you to go back from after you for i desire to be a proselyte this is how it's written from in into the from hebron to aramaic and so she's saying i desire to convert to judaism i want to now be bound to the to all your doctrine i want to be bound to the precepts of your faith that when she makes this statement that i don't don't encourage me anymore don't tell me and she says and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after the she's saying i want to now convert i no longer want to be a mobile i want to convert and brother adam takes this phrase and he says the gentile church first seeing the promise of god making the statement to sell out from everything to follow jehovah god so guinea see this the gentile church even there in the beginning as it's leaving its ideology and its heathenisms and the reprobate and being the stranger and the gospel is turning to to gentiles and be brought to them by peter and paul and it's the gentile church being confronted with the promises of god in making the statement to sell out from everything to follow jehovah god and declare themselves to be converted to truth not to do judaism but to christianity to christ but here ruth and like figure saying do not urge me to leave to go back from after you for i desire to be a convert to your to your faith to to accept your doctrines to accept your precepts of faith and at the time there was different levels uh how you could be a uh uh be converted to the jury they're in the promised land but she's she's committing herself now saying i desire to follow thee not just i'm gonna go where you go and and and hopefully they you know hopefully i can get a green card no she wanted to become a full-fledged citizen and naomi said i catch this this is to me where this drama gets very very rich and naomi said you want to be a proselyte you want to come you want to join our church you you want to follow in this truth you want to be a convert we are commanded to keep sabbaths in holy days says that we may not walk more than two thousand cubits you find in the book of acts it said they went uh a sabbath day's journey from jerusalem back it was these two thousand cubits it's even the the measurement that joshua gave that they should follow behind the ark and so the the rabbis and through the rich tradition and teaching they came up with this distance that you could travel on the sabbath day and so this is the conversation that they're given in this translation you you want to be a convert well we are commanded to keep sabbath days and holy days such that we cannot journey or travel only so far and in exodus chapter 16 verse 21 it says see for that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day this is the shabbat being instituted we're not to travel on the seventh day we cannot go out and collect bread on the seventh day it's the day holy unto the lord it's a day of rest and so naomi's telling ruth you want to be a convert well this is what our word says you want to follow after me you want to you want to do you want to say i don't argue with me anymore i'll go where i i don't try to argue with me and tell me to go back i want to be a convert he says if you want to be a convert we're commanded to keep the sabbath day holy even to the point where we can only travel so far and ruth says wherever you go i will go so it wasn't just her just rattling off you know hey don't tell me not to go wherever you go i'll go wherever you sleep i'll sleep and she's just kind of riffing dropping this little freestyle all of a sudden to ruth or to naomi and just coming up with things that sound good this was a conversation and i'm just using this uh as they amplify and i think it helps us to understand what ruth was declaring and to me it's it's likely that this unfolded more as a dialogue because now she's being provoked well you can only go so far and ruth says well i don't know enough but wherever you go i'll go whatever you're bound by i'm bound by now this is and i said well it kind of actually fell into the the trap i'm wanting you to avoid she was very specific in this instance if that's what you're bound by then i'll be bound by that so she says wherever you go i will go it wasn't without reference in other words this is what i'd like to emphasize to you it was not an abandonment to whatever but ruth's declaration was a a commitment to obey the word it was a declaration of obedience to the word of god to for her it was a declaration of obedience to the law that oh if that's in the law then i'll do that it wasn't well whatever you say naomi i'll do what you say but naomi said well our law says this and ruth said amen to that because when we give this declaration and we give this vow we're not just saying oh well whatever we'll do whatever such they say well we're committed brother aaron whatever wherever you go we'll go okay well let's not go to church anymore i would expect you to say sorry brother aaron that's where we part ways now you can let's not go to church anymore you can go wherever you want just be sure you send your ties to me none of you laughed why because you know it's true it happens or actually pastor will tell people you can go to another church you can go fellowship there you take your family go there stay there remain there terry there fellowship there become a part of it but why don't you keep paying your tithes ties to me that if there's got to come a point we realize what we're following is not man not personality not just family we're following the word of god so whatever the word says we say amen to so ruth and her response saying when she said wherever you go i will go the targum says that she says oh well you want to be a convert then you can't travel on the sabbath and even then you can only go so far and she says then wherever you go i'll go then naomi said we are commanded not to lodge with gentiles this is this is the this is the drama we're watching this is how it unfolds the very lines of redemption in acts chapter 10 verse 28 it says and he said unto them you know how that it is an unlawful thing peter speaking an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or to come unto one of another nation but god has shown me that i should not call any man common or unclean so peter makes reference to a law that says that it was unlawful for a jew to keep company with a stranger to come in and habitate with and we're not talking about having relations we're just talking about being in the same house do you find even in the book of john they would not go into the house of judgment unless they defiled themselves during the time of the passover and so they had to keep themselves even out of the house of a gentile i'm sorry i can't go in there are you a gentile sorry i can't even go in your house this is how strict the law was so here's naomi saying well we're commanded not to lodge with the gentiles and ruth said were you law java lodge see when you begin to look at how what she says wherever you go i'll go and where you lodge i will lodge it wasn't without some reference or it wasn't just some kind of comment just saying i'm completely abandoned wherever you go i'll go whatever wherever you lodge i'll lodge but there was some word attached to this declaration that if you can't travel on the sabbath then i won't travel on the sabbath if you can only go 2 000 cubits on the sabbath then i'll only go 2 000 cubits if you can't sleep in a gentile's home then i won't sleep in a gentile's home if that's what the word requires if that's what it takes to be a jew then i'm willing to do what it takes i think it makes i make i think it makes this vow in this declaration this clear-cut decision that we read in verses 16 and 17 even more precious than if it was just hey whatever you do i'll do right because otherwise it could just be like someone who's just resigned you know we never get to go where i want to go anyway so what have you picked that's fine right this was deliberate as joshua gave made it brought him to a very conscious and deliberate decision in the showdown this is also naomi making ruth very aware look you want to be a convert it's not like you're going to be able to go back into bethlehem judah and keep doing everything you've ever done before and just we're going to hang out and it's all everything's going to be fine and dandy no this is different there's a different requirement so naomi said as we're kind of looking as we're commanded to keep the sabbaths well where you go i'll go and we're commanded not to lodge with the gentiles where you lodge allah comes back again we are commanded to keep 613 commandments it's the mitzvah or the law of moses as it says in deuteronomy 33 4 moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the congregation of jacob and they say that moses gave 611 commandments to uh to israel and then there's the two of the first commandments that god gave them when he spoke to them and they heard those two commandments that gives you 613 commandments that they've traditionally aggregated to believe that these are 613 commandments that we must follow say when naomi ruth said ah i want to be a convert she says well you can only go certain places then i'll go where you go well you can only lodge certain places than all lodge where you lodge well we have to keep 613 commandments and it's interesting when you begin to look at these different commandments traditionally there's 365 commandments to abstain from certain acts 365 commandments not to do something and they say that's one for every day of the year and so there's 365 commandments they call them negative commandments not to do something and then there's 248 commandments to perform an act so 365 which would represent every day of the year not to do something the negative commandments or 248 commandments to perform an act which they say is a positive commandment and so what's the 248 well i found where the jews say that it's a combination of the number of bones in our bodies and the main organs in our body so you have a negative commandment for 365 days 365 negative commandments that covers every day of our year and then you have these positive commandments 248 which covers every bone in your body and every main organ in your body 613 commandments in total that you must keep in order to be a jew and ruth said whatever your people keep i will keep as if they were my people from before this so when she says your people will be my people it's more than just you know kind of they'll be my cousins i'll call him cousin i'll call him brother i'll call him sister no it was like you realize you're gonna have to keep 613 commandments isn't it wonderful that when we came to christ it wasn't that we understood at all all the things we'd have to do all the things we'd give up all the things that would be expected of us maybe we could kind of read the room a little bit go it looks like i might have to wear a skirt to church looks like maybe i might have to grow my hair out guys look pretty normal i mean i might be all right my wife this can be tough on earth and isn't it just great that you just fall in love with him and it's something deep and something real so that whenever the the the word comes and says you ought not to do this you go well then i won't do it whenever the word comes and says that you ought to do this you say well then i will do it because that's what ruth did in this conversation in verses 16 and 17 she gives this tremendous vow and declaration of uh where you go i will go where you lodge i will lodge and your people shall be my people there's there's a there's this in this other translation into the aramaic there's this conversation that's given this drama that's unfolding it's homolytic to where that's like well this challenge and that challenge and this statement and this response and she says your people will be my people as if i was raised in this as if this was my culture this was my belief if there's 613 positive and negative commandments then for 365 days a year and with every bone and organ in my body i'll do the same that's beautiful naomi said we're commanded not to worship foreign gods in exodus 20 verses 3 to 5 thou shalt not have other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in a heaven above or that is in the earth beneath that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me i'm doing this to show you that with each interjection by naomi there's a word that it's attached to what it wasn't like naomi saying hey look if you're going to live in my house no corn fed beef right if you're going to live in my house then you know you're not you're not going to be able to drink diet coke we're pepsi only here that wasn't it right brother obed pepsi only that wasn't what that wasn't the declaration that was being made it was it could come back to the word it wasn't naomi laying down the house rules for how that they would get along and cohabitate in bethlehem judah well if you're coming with me then this is the way you're going to realize right now i get the master bedroom and you're not going to do this and you're not going to do that and you're going to have to do your own year and we're going to split the utilities you're going to pay half the rent she just kept coming back to the word and with each one as i read from exodus and the book of acts and deuteronomy and again in exodus thou shalt have no other gods before me when naomi said and we are commanded not to worship foreign gods that's the word coming up before roof naomi even representing this word challenging ruth leading ruth geinerth and ruth says your god is my god are you i is this opening up to you and maybe just a small way just maybe a little bit more a different angle a different side to it just to see when she says and treat me not to leave there or to return from following after thee where you go i'll go where you lodge outlaws your people shall be my people and thy god my god there's so much more that ruth is declaring in this moment verse 17 naomi said this one i thought was very interesting we have four death penalties for the guilty i've just told you that you can't travel so far on the sabbath you should remain in your place you can you can't lodge with the gentiles there's 613 commandments that you must follow and you can't worship any foreign gods and by the way we have four different types of death if you violate these things stoning with stones burning with fire execution or beheading by the sword and strangulation are hanging on a tree and i actually began to find all these places in the old testament where it talked about burning and stoning and being killed at the edge of the sword and wow there's some pretty remarkable stuff out there that they ride into the and deep dive very very deeply into these things and actually some that has worked its way into court cases and arguments of what was neces what's correct for capital punishment and what manner of death ought to be used to execute the guilty so very very interesting maybe from a legal standpoint even a theological standpoint but i don't feel there needs to be much amplification of it we know their stonings for the guilty we know that there was uh burning of the guilty a priest daughter she defiled herself she was to be burned there was that execution with the edge of the sword the beheading we know that there was hanging strangulation that each one of these capital punishments were given and naomi how what a sweet conversation at the borderline right we're getting ready to go through immigration do you have your passport ready just want you to know before you present your papers you could be hung if you worship another god it's very sober and we always wait right to the right before you you're going to cross paths through immigration and you're going to be showing your papers like you better straighten up don't say anything don't laugh don't joke around let me answer the questions right if they ask if we have anything in our suitcases let me answer the question and this is the time everything's getting you know everything's getting serious now it's all burnt up and this is exactly what naomi's doing i guess just to create this great excitement for roof right you're looking forward to bethlehem judah did you know you could be there's capital punishment four different ways you know what ruth says how you die i shall die if that's what your word says then that's what your word says it wasn't just when she's given this declaration where thou diest will i die it was how you die what by whatever means you're judged by whatever determination is made by your god then i accept that she says how you die i shall die and so naomi said we have a cemetery three cubits we have very specific rules our house of burial there's a way that we're buried you say you're going to die how i die did you know you just can't be buried in any way in our religion that it not only does it govern with the negative commandments 365 days a year and the positive commandments every bone and organ in your body and not only can you not worship any god you want and not only can you only travel two thousand cubits on a saturday and you can be killed if you violate certain provisions in our law and then once you're dead you have to be buried a certain way i mean just in this few statements it's covering everything your entire life ruth is going to change everything how you live how you die and if you think it ends then even how you're buried and so what does ruth say and there i will be buried then fine that's where i'll be buried i'll go where the word says go i'll serve with the word says serve i'll obey what the word says obey i accept the consequences if i don't i will suffer the death that's required and then wherever it buries me i bury it buries me that's selling out that's what brandon's talking about uh someone making a decision not just kind of halfway borderline it's like i'm all in here it is if we're going to use a showdown all my chips are in these are my cards here whatever the rules are here i am judge me i'm willing to do it and there will i be buried and then she says and do not say anymore and to me this is kind of what amplifies the the dialogue here we have four death penalties well where you die all dying you're going to be buried in a certain place then bury me where i'm supposed to be buried she says do not say anymore may the lord do thus to me and more against me if even death shall separate me from you the way that it's translated it's not even a separation in death it's not till death do we part it's may i suffer may he inflict any of these punishments on me and any worse punishment if i ever separate from these things no matter what it is it's not even till death we part but even in death if i am not buried where you're buried according to your word according to your law according to your customs then may the lord inflict any punishment on me and any worse punishment than these things that you have said of these death penalties of stoning and burning and beheading and strangulation let him inflict any of these punishments and worse on me if i would ever deviate from this word quite a declaration that when we read it entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after me for wither thou goest i will go and where thou law just i will watch thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou die will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee in me can i just read it again as this dialogue do not urge me to leave you to go back from after you for i desire to be a proselyte well we're commanded to keep sabbath's holy days such that we may not walk more than 2 000 cubits then where you go i'll go well we're commanded not to lodge with gentiles where you lodge our laws we're commanded to keep 613 commandments what your people keep i will keep as if they were my people from before this well we're commanded not to worship foreign gods your god is my god we have four death penalties for guilt for the guilty stoning with stones burning with fire execution by the sword and hanging on a tree how you die i shall die well we can only be buried in a cemetery of three cubits then there i'll be buried and do not say any more may the lord do thus to me and more against me if even death shall separate me from you and then it says in verse 18 when she saw that she was determined to go with her she ended the conversation with her showdown when she saw okay all right maybe the sabbath day yeah maybe someone would say well i won't go to the store on the sabbath day all right fine i can only go two thousand cubits okay well i know i'll only worship one god but with each one there was nothing in the word that caused ruth to stumble she just kept saying amen to the word and so then in this showdown at this point when naomi saw that she was determined when in our king james version it's steadfastly minded courageous strong convinced when she saw that she was determined to go with her this could be the narrator she ended the conversation with her and the scene fades out there's the end of the showdown this is the point at which ruth has made the declaration she has sold out she has committed she's going all the way she was determined steadfastly minded as they made reference in the beginning and we're just gonna we'll just close here on this brother micah wants to just get ready in hebrews chapter 11 verse 8. hebrews chapter 11 verse 8 it says by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed what was he told in the scripture get up and go to land that i'll show you here after and what did abraham do tell me where i'm going first he just upped right he got up he did it by faith when he was called to go into a place which he should after receive for inheritance get up and go to a place i'll show you here after says he obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went and i want to use i want to use the faith of abraham as the faith that ruth had because fruth is making this decision by faith and and even as she makes this declaration orpah says goodbye naomi see you later orpah cleaves to naomi and it's this instinct no no i want to go with you she says no no my daughter-in-law just go back your sister's gone now you go she says oh no no please please uh i'll be i want to be a jew i want to be like you naomi and she says oh really well did you know we have a law that on the sabbath you can only go 2 000 cubits where you go i'll go well did you know you can't even sleep with your family anymore that you you'll have to separate from your family you can't even lodge you can't even go in the house you can't even dwell with the gentile where you lodge a lodge oh did you know you can't worship any other gods i'll have no other gods before me your god will be my god did you know there's 613 commandments you'll have to follow that's 365 with every bone and organ in your body i'll serve your god as if it was the way i was raised your people would be my people well did you know there's four different penalties if you don't keep them then i'll die how your word says i die and then if you die you have to be buried a certain way then bury me the way your words just bury me it was an unfolding thing but in it there was nothing that could stumble ruth because it was by faith there wasn't a point at which name it could say oh and by the way you can't mix your cottons with your linens and ruth is like that's it i'm out i'm very bohemian i like to dress how i want to dress and that's not going to work for me hold wait for me if that's what the word says i'll do it that's what the word says i'll do it that's what abraham said god you want me to get up you want me to go then i'll go and by faith he went out he obeyed by faith by instinct by faith not knowing whether he went brother makes this statement about ruth it's so beautiful and why little bethlehem but ruth said i will not go back and notice what he identifies faith rooted grounded perfect faith had come unto ruth's heart that's what i want you to recognize tonight it was what rooted in faith's heart was perv it was faith that's what had come into ruth's heart because truly as this conversation and targum relates it ruth doesn't really know all that awaits for her she doesn't know what her days hold she doesn't know what promises are there for her she doesn't know what remedies are available to her she doesn't fully understand all 613 she doesn't understand everything that may be necessary but as she goes on this journey it makes this declaration naomi begins to share with her and what is it that meets the challenge in every single instance faith does because what it rooted and grounded in her heart was faith and if it's a perfect faith let me just say it this way perfect faith is the faith that you need for the moment of the showdown that you're in it's the faith that meets the challenge that you're in she exhibited a faith a perfect faith for that moment but we'll see as she goes forward her faith keeps answering the bell her faith keeps answering the challenge and her faith brings her to that union and that conception and your faith is going to do the same for you why because it's not just a faith it's not just a moab thing it's not just a family thing it's not a personality thing but it's something rooted in your heart it's coming to your heart and ruth doesn't know what awaits her but as we said last time this is the thought that just struck me at the very beginning a couple weeks ago when i began to look at a showdown is the only justification that ruth had for what she was doing was faith that's the only justification she had orpha could say i don't know ruth have you thought about this right they kind of orpah kind of looks over at ruth they kind of slow down a little bit naomi kind of gets a little bit ahead and oprah's remember some of those things our husbands talked about if you noticed really how naomi lives like it was always so different like are you ready are you real i mean don't you think it's a little funny yeah i mean yeah it was what our husbands believed but they didn't even really fully believe it or they never would have married us this conversation begins to unfold and and ruth could be like yeah you know it's a good point what were they doing anyways in moab and now why do we even need to go back doesn't this seem like there's a bunch of inconsistencies here and with quebec yeah yeah i mean i see what you're saying but i think i'm gonna go upon what basis faith i don't have anything else to go on orpha i just know that something inside of me is stirring me something inside of me is moving me this is home to me this is real this is truth this is where i belong i i'm i'm willing to go all the way well i don't think i can go all the way with you that's fine but i'm gonna go and the only justification ruth could give was faith [Music] faith was drawing her in its faith that justified her never forget that ruth never forget that it's your faith that's drama let's stand tonight a showdown [Music] let's just offer a prayer thanksgiving to him tonight that it's his faith his faith that's kept us what a grace by grace are you saved through faith and both are gifts of god heavenly father i thank you that we've had these highlights given to us these nuggets that have been laid before us that point us to truths [Music] and i've zero in on certain things about this great story and we've been able to identify ourselves in it and lord i know that the people gathered here tonight those that are listening to the archive or even streaming live identify so perfectly with ruth tonight in their own journey in their own path they realize that all along when they didn't have answers even when they thought they had answers that all along it was faith that justified them it's faith that alone is their justification for following for ask how else could ruth accept 613 commandments that she didn't even know how else could she conceive the shabbat and 2000 cubits how else could she accept four different types of capital punishment how much could she accept a certain manner of burial unless faith said if it's the word i accepted unless somehow deep inside her faith had rooted a perfect faith it grounded in her heart and said that this is truth this is right this is righteousness this is what i long for this is what's going to make me whole whatever it is this bethlehem judah whatever's required of me whatever awaits me i accept it and i'll receive it and lord i believe that we as believers have caught a vision of this message as it's presented itself to us we've continued to say amen and in our journey we've had difficult conversations with the orpah i learned it when we it got separated at the end of the day and all got laid out on the table and there was a showdown at the end of the day we just simply said i believe i believe by faith i believe christ is leading me i believe at the end of day that he's speaking to my heart that he's given me this blessed promise it's his voice i hear lord this is not just a blind adherence to a man who says i'm a prophet of god and we say oh you're a prophet we'll go wherever you go and we'll sleep wherever you sleep and we'll believe whatever you believe but no lord he showed us the word and we said we believe that and then he showed us the word we said we believe that and it hasn't just some it's not some blind loyalty to an ideology it's not a blind loyalty to a personality it's not a blind loyalty to a church it's an individual commitment to truth and i believe that's what's represented here at arizona believer's church i believe that's what's represented within these four walls of this hilton garden inn is not a discipline to one another not a commitment to a church name not a not a union of a family but individual commitments to obey your word and it's your word that's leading us and it's your spirit that has actually brought us together and that's why we can have fellowship and lord is ruth stood there that day in a showdown she answered each objection with the word of god an amen an amen and an amen lord may we do so may we do so lord as your bride respond in a showdown just like she did not to reason well naomi what is 2000 cubits and where does it begin and just how far can i go do you really need to keep it is that just a man's idea and is this just something some man came up with she said amen lord she didn't she didn't try to trifle with it and argue and try to figure out where it came from and whether or not it was substantiated faith answered each time where you go i'll go where you lodge all lodge your people be my people your god will be my god how you die i'll die how you're buried i'm buried i've made my decision i've decided may we have a rekindling of that decision tonight give us a renewed vigor lord for the choices that we've made we're not gonna waver as a church lord we're not gonna waver wavers individuals are not going to waver lord if we run into difficulties and and circumstances inhibit us in some way lord we know we've made our decision what a weighted roof was difficult journeys and passages maybe even thieves along the way and a hard road to follow and the heat and whatever the elements may have been that would be attacking them in this harvest time that would keep them from making their making it at their destination she had a steadfast decision and she had a made-up mind she was gonna make it and may we today have a rekindling of the vision that we have we've caught a vision we've got a made up mind we're going all the way with you lord bless us tonight i pray may this be an encouragement to your people in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
