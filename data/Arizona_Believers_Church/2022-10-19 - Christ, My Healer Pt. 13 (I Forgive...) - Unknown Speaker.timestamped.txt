[0:00] and he says Jesus answering saith
[0:04] unto them and we know this is after he
[0:06] had cursed the Fig Tree and they were
[0:08] just very curious about how he'd so
[0:11] quickly withered away he says have faith
[0:13] in God
[0:14] for verily I say unto you that
[0:15] whatsoever whosoever shall say unto this
[0:18] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[0:20] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[0:22] his heart but shall believe that those
[0:24] things which he saith shall come to pass
[0:26] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[0:29] and now that's that's that Declaration
[0:32] of faith and just how powerful faith is
[0:35] and then to see how quickly he follows
[0:37] this up he says therefore I send you
[0:39] whatsoever things ye desire When you
[0:41] pray believe that you receive them and
[0:43] you shall have them and when you stand
[0:45] praying forgive if you have ought
[0:47] against any that your father also which
[0:50] is in heaven May forgive you your
[0:51] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[0:54] neither will your father which is in
[0:55] heaven forgive your trespasses
[0:58] you can be seated
[1:00] hopefully that um
[1:02] we're gonna we're just picking up on
[1:04] where we were last Sunday so I hope that
[1:06] some of these things that we
[1:08] could go back over uh we don't have need
[1:10] to maybe expound on them very much but
[1:12] this is part 13 on Christ my healer
[1:15] we're fully within the the subject
[1:17] matter of Divine Healing and how to
[1:19] receive it and tonight our title even
[1:22] though this is a continuation of Sunday
[1:24] morning my title tonight is I forgive
[1:26] and I've kind of allowed it to be a
[1:29] little bit of a dot dot dot on that you
[1:32] could go to that next slide there
[1:33] brother John I forgive that's the title
[1:35] tonight and I've included those other
[1:38] two subtitles we've used recently on The
[1:40] Chronic conditions of the heart and
[1:41] vision correction because it's
[1:43] continuing on that process of looking or
[1:46] continuing on
[1:48] um us examining and looking at the role
[1:50] of our minds and the role of our
[1:52] emotions in terms of our sickness but
[1:55] maybe more importantly in terms of our
[1:56] healing and I believe that we're
[1:58] recognizing or remembering and recalling
[2:00] just how significant our state of mind
[2:02] is in terms of receiving the word of God
[2:05] and and receiving our healing and so
[2:07] tonight continuing on the subject from
[2:10] Sunday but we're going to call it I
[2:12] forgive so let's do a quick rundown of
[2:14] last week last Sunday on I'm sorry and I
[2:17] just want to touch on a few points so
[2:19] that we're kind of in the in the thought
[2:21] process
[2:22] um or in thinking together in this I've
[2:24] I'm literally just wanting to pick up
[2:26] where I was and I feel like we had such
[2:28] good momentum that I want to kind of
[2:30] pick some of that back up and
[2:33] so the the primary thought that we begin
[2:36] to express on on Sunday is building the
[2:39] foundation is how that our heart records
[2:41] or extores all of our experiences what
[2:44] we see what we hear what we taste what
[2:46] we smell all the things that we endure
[2:48] in Life or go through or enjoy or
[2:51] experience the heart the mind is
[2:53] recording things and it's storing things
[2:55] and so that your emotions are a giant
[2:58] Storehouse of experiences and as a
[3:01] storehouse we talked about how
[3:04] um whenever experiences may be something
[3:05] for the first time then that can produce
[3:07] a filter for the next time that you
[3:09] experience it and if you've had a bad
[3:11] experience it kind of colors your
[3:13] experience the next time oh we want to
[3:15] go eat at this restaurant I had a bad
[3:17] experience and you'd find sometimes if
[3:18] you've had a bad experience with a
[3:20] particular kind of food you'll avoid it
[3:22] for the rest of your life just because
[3:24] of one bad experience well what is it
[3:25] that's doing that it you say well it's
[3:27] my appetite it's your memory right it's
[3:29] your appetite that's been influenced by
[3:31] and shaped by your memory and by your
[3:33] experiences
[3:33] and maybe a little bit of your
[3:35] imagination because you're kind of
[3:36] imagine I don't want this to happen
[3:38] again but that mind and your emotions
[3:40] become a filter uh and an influence we
[3:43] mentioned how it's just kind of there to
[3:44] stamp things when it comes in it filters
[3:46] it and it learns it processes things and
[3:49] in Proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 it says
[3:52] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[3:53] out of it are the issues of life this if
[3:57] you could weigh a scripture the the
[3:59] heaviness of the scripture is so
[4:01] significant and so powerful I've been
[4:04] thinking about it even more since last
[4:06] Sunday and thought my we could just
[4:09] continue to drill down on what the
[4:10] scripture is referring to how much there
[4:13] there is in our our hearts and our minds
[4:15] and how that life is proceeding forth
[4:18] from our emotions life is proceeding
[4:19] forth from our heart we looked into the
[4:21] scripture and saw that a man acts from
[4:23] his emotions he acts from his heart you
[4:26] say well brother Branham I've got the
[4:27] whole brother Aaron I I got the Holy
[4:29] Ghost and I act from I act from my soul
[4:31] well then it's the soul influence in
[4:33] your emotion questions it's a sole
[4:35] influence in your heart but you're going
[4:37] to act from your Consciousness you're
[4:39] going to act from your spirit as a
[4:40] person and that's why we want to be
[4:42] perfected in our character and so when
[4:45] the Bible says keep thy heart for out of
[4:47] it issue are the issues of Life
[4:49] something comes from your life from your
[4:51] heart and therefore when we think of
[4:53] channels of the spirit we think Gates or
[4:56] channels and we might just think well
[4:58] these are just doors or this is just a
[5:00] highway and this thought comes and it
[5:02] just passes through and it moves on to
[5:03] the next stop but this is your mind is
[5:05] not just a temporary pass-through it
[5:07] actually has storage
[5:09] and what you see what you hear what you
[5:11] taste what you feel all these different
[5:13] things are stored in your emotions
[5:15] stored in your heart and I would say for
[5:17] later use
[5:19] that whether it be good or bad it's
[5:21] stored for later use Jesus even using
[5:23] that language in Luke chapter six how
[5:25] from the good treasure a good man from
[5:27] the good treasure in his heart an evil
[5:29] man from the evil treasure in his heart
[5:30] saying that that something stored up
[5:32] something deposited into a man's spirit
[5:35] and so from the man's heart as he thinks
[5:37] and from a man's Spirit as he's acting
[5:39] these things are issuing forth and he
[5:41] says from the abundance of the heart
[5:43] from the abundance of things that you
[5:44] think about the things you see the
[5:46] things you hear the things you read you
[5:49] you speak from so it's all being stored
[5:51] there in your spirit
[5:52] and then in Proverbs chapter 18 verse 8
[5:54] it says the words of a tale Bearer are
[5:56] his wounds and they go down into the
[5:58] innermost parts of the belly
[6:00] and that that visual of how that a lie
[6:03] is deposited into the storehouse of a
[6:05] heart uh it kind of grabs our attention
[6:08] that it's not just something we hear and
[6:11] then and then even can even if we forget
[6:13] about it there's something that's
[6:15] happened to where there's an injury
[6:17] there's an impact and it says it goes
[6:19] down to the innermost parts of the belly
[6:21] it resides there it's held there so
[6:24] that's kind of looking at how that the
[6:26] heart records things and remembers
[6:28] things and stores up things and then we
[6:30] we took that and then we the next part
[6:33] of the sermon we moved into how that
[6:34] we've got to address any condemnation in
[6:37] our heart or anything that's in our
[6:39] Spirits uh when we that would hinder us
[6:41] when we seek God for something
[6:43] we don't want to we don't want to come
[6:45] before God asking and then have a heart
[6:48] that's condemned and Jesus is teaching
[6:50] that to us when he says uh when he
[6:53] teaches us how to pray and he says that
[6:55] we ought to ask for forgiveness we're
[6:57] addressing anything that we consciously
[6:59] know in our Spirits is out of harmony
[7:01] with what God's will is and we just say
[7:03] Lord I'm sorry I've made mistakes I did
[7:05] something wrong I I've done this and we
[7:07] simply ask for forgiveness brother
[7:10] Bradham says in perfect faith and this
[7:11] would be a good sermon if you wanted to
[7:13] listen to that just brings in so many
[7:15] different principles on this subject he
[7:17] said if there's condemnation in your
[7:19] life straighten that first
[7:20] that's what we ought to do if there's if
[7:22] you want something from God if you want
[7:24] healing if you want an answer then deal
[7:26] with any condemnation in your life and
[7:29] and when we say that it it would be
[7:31] anything that even the devil's trying to
[7:33] use against you and just say Lord I'm
[7:35] going to be honest with you the devil's
[7:36] trying to beat me up about this or Lord
[7:38] my heart's condemning me that I said
[7:40] this or I offended this person Lord I
[7:42] did something wrong to you you just have
[7:44] to confess it to him and say you're
[7:46] sorry
[7:48] I'll say this respectfully and I don't
[7:51] want it to sound like I'm just trying to
[7:53] toss off on something but we can have a
[7:55] we can have a Catholic mindset with a
[7:57] lot of things that we feel that we've
[7:59] got to do this pen Penance and we've got
[8:01] to suffer and we've got to we've got to
[8:03] feel a certain way and and it's got a
[8:05] really we got to really punish ourselves
[8:07] in order to make it feel like we've
[8:08] we've done we've done our penance
[8:11] and and really uh a repentant heart
[8:14] Godly sorrow in a contrite spirit and a
[8:17] Brokenness is what God will receive not
[8:19] somebody's time to physically beat
[8:21] themselves and it's remarkable what
[8:22] people will do with that Faith they'll
[8:24] crawl on their knees up the steps of a
[8:26] of a cathedral and bloody themselves
[8:28] thinking that in doing so God will have
[8:31] pity on them when all they would need to
[8:33] do is to say Lord forgive me I'm sorry
[8:35] you don't need to beat yourself up you
[8:37] don't need to inflict pain you don't
[8:38] need to try to make God think you you
[8:40] can feel that you know him know that you
[8:42] feel how sorry you are he knows your
[8:44] heart he's looking at your spirit and so
[8:46] if there's condonation straighten it out
[8:48] and brother Brandon says go make that
[8:50] thing right go out there and confess
[8:51] this into your husband to your wife go
[8:53] do this thing so in other words there's
[8:55] maybe some things that you can make
[8:56] right with a particular person he said
[8:58] he'll never do you any good no matter
[9:00] who you pray for till you make that
[9:01] right
[9:02] and so there's a there's a making things
[9:04] right in our hearts and it's exactly
[9:07] what James touches on in James chapter 5
[9:09] where he says are any sick or any
[9:11] Afflicted in mind then pray are you sad
[9:14] if you are sing hymns and he says uh if
[9:17] you're sick call for the elders to
[9:19] anoint you with oil and the prayer of
[9:21] faith verse 15 shall save the sick and
[9:23] the Lord shall raise him up and if he
[9:26] have committed sins they shall be
[9:27] forgiven him James is identifying for
[9:30] some people the cause of sickness and
[9:33] the hindrance to Healing that if we're
[9:35] asking God to heal us of our of in our
[9:38] sick body if there's anything that's not
[9:39] right in our Spirits just ask God to
[9:41] forgive us
[9:42] and and if there's a if there's a
[9:44] sickness that's the cause of
[9:46] Disobedience then you ask God to forgive
[9:48] you you say I'm sorry
[9:50] and I realized and I was really really
[9:52] encouraged by the amount of feedback I
[9:54] got after this past Sunday and a lot of
[9:57] it wasn't necessary great job that was
[9:59] really good brother Aaron it was more
[10:00] I've got a question right and and I
[10:04] realize I'm trying to make this very
[10:05] simple but I realize that once you take
[10:08] that simple principle and start applying
[10:10] it to your life you realize wow this is
[10:11] complex
[10:13] this is how do I apply this and what
[10:15] does it mean if this happens what does
[10:17] it mean if that happens and so I
[10:18] realized that to the individual there's
[10:20] a lot there's a lot that this would mean
[10:22] and I'll also say this as I it purposed
[10:24] in my heart to say this I realize that
[10:27] the real thrust of this an emphasis
[10:29] especially tonight may not apply to all
[10:31] of us
[10:33] may not apply to any of us right now
[10:35] but maybe you could look back and say oh
[10:37] I remember it applies then and maybe
[10:39] you'll come into it later
[10:41] but it's a principle nonetheless in the
[10:42] word of God so if I'm preaching on it
[10:45] and I appreciated the fact that everyone
[10:46] was willing that I talked to who wanted
[10:48] to talk about it Federal was willing to
[10:50] take what was said and examine
[10:51] themselves by it and be so sincere
[10:54] towards like I'm really trying to find
[10:56] where I'm wrong I'm really trying to
[10:58] find who I need to apologize to I'm
[10:59] really trying to find who I need to
[11:01] forgive and I think that's wonderful but
[11:03] at the same time it's a principle that
[11:05] may not apply to you right now
[11:07] but yet it's a principle that's that is
[11:09] applicable at times and very important
[11:11] for us to remember and so there is
[11:14] I'm trying to saw what I was trying to
[11:16] say there is I'm wanting to make this
[11:17] very very simple and if we could instead
[11:20] of making it complicated if it seems
[11:23] just to be a little bit Out Of Reach
[11:24] just just ask God to give you
[11:25] understanding
[11:26] and and to help you apply it so then
[11:29] continues confess your faults one to
[11:30] another pray for one another that may be
[11:32] healed the effectual prayer of a
[11:34] righteous man a man who's made things
[11:36] right
[11:37] availeth much
[11:39] if you've committed sins they shall be
[11:41] forgiven you so he says confess your
[11:42] faults one to another pray for one
[11:44] another that you may be healed do you
[11:46] realize how James is connecting then
[11:48] forgiveness and conscious your
[11:50] conscience together with a clear
[11:52] conscience together with your healing
[11:53] and we talked about that at the very
[11:55] beginning of this scripture in verses 13
[11:58] and 14. how we say oh just go run and
[12:00] get the elders anoint me with oil and
[12:02] pray for me but if you're in a bad mood
[12:05] right if you're not in the right Spirit
[12:07] if you don't have the right mental
[12:08] attitude towards the promise of God then
[12:11] maybe we could say it's really
[12:13] presumptuous of you to expect your
[12:14] healing
[12:15] and and I guess if you did get healed
[12:18] despite your bad attitude we'd say well
[12:19] you get what you expect
[12:21] way to go good job but description on
[12:23] the list is telling us to be mindful of
[12:26] these things when we approach prayer and
[12:28] he's saying the prayer face shall save
[12:29] the sick but if you have sins you ask
[12:31] you'll repent you confess you make
[12:34] things right brother Branham says and
[12:36] has the Lord spoken only to Moses makes
[12:37] a very uh attention-getting statement
[12:40] and every one of you right now if you've
[12:41] got Unforgiven sins you confess it and
[12:43] make it right that's simple
[12:45] come on if you have sin you have not
[12:47] repented of repent of it
[12:50] he does he doesn't go on for paragraph
[12:52] after paragraph talking about how you
[12:54] need to make it right he just says if
[12:55] you've got Unforgiven sins confess it
[12:58] and make it right and God will heal you
[13:01] but it cannot heal you with Unforgiven
[13:03] sin sin that is not you have not asked
[13:06] forgiveness for that you have not
[13:07] repented of he says Satan still has a
[13:09] jurisdiction over you now that that's a
[13:12] remarkable statement that with
[13:14] unconfessed sin and you realize that
[13:16] there's other places in the even in the
[13:18] scripture and in the in the message of
[13:19] the hour where if someone is not
[13:21] Sanctified and they try to rebuke a
[13:24] devil they try to push the devil off of
[13:26] somebody the devil's looking at that
[13:27] person and saying your spirit
[13:29] does not have any power over mine
[13:32] you you cannot stand in the name of
[13:35] Jesus Christ and condemn me
[13:37] or cast me out when you have Unforgiven
[13:39] sin now you say well that the way he
[13:42] phrases it that Satan has jurisdiction
[13:43] over you
[13:45] uh maybe if it helps you to look at it
[13:47] this way God is very careful to
[13:49] vindicate you if you know if you had not
[13:52] made something right
[13:55] and God's not going to stand by you and
[13:57] honor your prayer or to or to honor your
[14:00] efforts if he knows that you're in a
[14:02] position where you need to make
[14:03] something right
[14:05] and so it's something that God is
[14:06] allowing then this jurisdiction
[14:09] and then in Matthew chapter 6 verses 9
[14:11] to 15 it's the Lord's Prayer and I'm I'm
[14:13] taking too much time in this I apologize
[14:15] in the Lord's Prayer we recognize how
[14:18] kind of the the center part the heart of
[14:20] the Lord teaching us how to pray was
[14:22] forgiveness
[14:23] that this was the real secret this was a
[14:26] real mystery maybe not a mystery but
[14:28] this is the real heart of what he was
[14:29] teaching us is he says that when we pray
[14:31] we should ask for forgiveness as you've
[14:34] forgiven others and then that's the only
[14:36] principle he revisits after he teaches
[14:38] the disciples how to pray and so he's
[14:40] saying that when we approach him we say
[14:42] give us this day our daily bread we say
[14:44] I'm sorry for anything I've done wrong
[14:46] forgive me as I have forgiven others so
[14:49] when he asked for us to be forgiven of
[14:51] our debts it's showing that we must seek
[14:54] forgiveness for anything that we've said
[14:55] or done wrong before that we ask or when
[14:59] asking God something
[15:01] and and let me just kind of finish this
[15:04] part uh this addressing condemnation in
[15:06] our hearts in Psalms 139 verses 23 and
[15:10] 24. like to read the scripture and just
[15:13] say this
[15:14] that if you are you if you aren't
[15:17] conscious of anything that you need to
[15:19] repent of or there's things that you
[15:21] you've searched your heart you don't
[15:22] know or there's nothing you exactly
[15:24] remember that you just trust God that
[15:27] he'll show you if there's anything you
[15:29] need to make right
[15:30] let's not let's not make it this simple
[15:32] well if I've done something wrong then
[15:34] I'm just going to apologize
[15:36] and since you can't think of anything
[15:37] you're just going to beat yourself up
[15:39] and do your pittance until you can think
[15:41] of something to apologize for no we're
[15:44] that's not what you do
[15:45] if you can't think of anything you're
[15:47] just sincere before God and you could
[15:48] even pray this prayer search me oh God
[15:50] and know my heart try me and know my
[15:53] thoughts and see if there be any wicked
[15:55] way in me and Lead Me in the way
[15:57] Everlasting
[15:59] that you would just ask God if there's
[16:01] something that I need to make right if
[16:02] there's something that I've done wrong
[16:04] then Lord I'm sincere before you now
[16:06] show me now that's what I would that's
[16:09] what I think that we should do in light
[16:11] of the fact that we forgiveness is a
[16:13] critical part to us asking praying and
[16:16] receiving what we asked for
[16:18] and how many of you could testify that
[16:20] when you've asked God to show if you've
[16:22] ever done anything wrong he was faithful
[16:23] to show you
[16:25] so many of us could testify to that
[16:26] where we've we may not even known but
[16:28] just in our prayer because we have the
[16:30] habit of praying and also a habit of
[16:32] when we pray Lord if I've done anything
[16:33] wrong show me and you're saying here
[16:35] Lord forgive me if I've done anything
[16:36] wrong and Lord if I if there's anything
[16:38] that I need to make right let me
[16:42] right and immediately you're like oh
[16:46] all right okay God
[16:48] I feel it I know I know what I need to
[16:50] do and we know what's happened
[16:53] I believe that we ought to have this
[16:54] kind of confidence that if God wants us
[16:56] to know something he'll show us
[16:58] and have that kind of expectation have
[17:00] that kind of Desire that if I need to
[17:02] know something God will show me and have
[17:03] that confidence as parents with your
[17:05] children my goodness with what kids can
[17:07] do these these days and what they can do
[17:09] secretly and what they can do privately
[17:11] and the things that people can get away
[17:13] with we just say God if it's something I
[17:15] need to know show me
[17:17] and children God will show your parents
[17:22] kids eat free
[17:26] and so when we are the kind of the third
[17:28] part to
[17:30] um catching up where we were on Sunday
[17:31] when we pray for healing this is where I
[17:34] want to start tonight when we pray for
[17:36] healing we not only seek forgiveness for
[17:38] anything that we've done wrong but we
[17:39] Grant forgiveness also
[17:41] to those who've done wrong to us
[17:44] and that was such an important principle
[17:46] that we were ending on and I want to
[17:48] just pick up where we left off last time
[17:50] and so and when we read our text tonight
[17:53] are we are you with me on this each one
[17:55] of you so
[17:57] when we read in our text have faith in
[18:00] God because the disciples are puzzled by
[18:02] how this tree had withered so quickly
[18:04] he's just just have faith
[18:06] because you could speak to a mountain
[18:08] and brother talks about if you have need
[18:10] of it in your motive and objective and
[18:12] so you could speak to this mountain and
[18:14] not doubt in your heart and believe that
[18:15] what you've said shall come to pass then
[18:17] you could have whatsoever you saith
[18:20] and then Jesus kind of summarizes that
[18:23] principle a more General language not so
[18:24] specific about mountains but in a
[18:27] general principle that can apply to
[18:28] anything he says whatsoever things you
[18:30] desire When you pray believe that you
[18:33] receive them and you shall have them
[18:35] so this is a principle of praying and
[18:37] asking the prayer of faith shall save
[18:38] the sick I desire to be healed so I can
[18:41] pray and receive what I have and Jesus
[18:42] says and
[18:44] when you stand praying forgive if you
[18:46] have ought against any
[18:48] so this is still a part of our prayer
[18:50] this is part of our thinking this is
[18:52] part of our our minds and our hearts the
[18:54] condition of our heart when we go before
[18:55] the Lord to pray and he says that we
[18:58] must forgive if we have ought against
[19:00] any which means if you have anything
[19:02] against anyone
[19:03] that's what it means if you have ought
[19:05] the ought there
[19:07] um how many think of ought as if you
[19:09] have ought means you got you have ought
[19:11] in your heart like we think like it's
[19:13] you're we're dropping the F and it
[19:14] becomes like we fought and now I have
[19:16] ought but it really means just anything
[19:19] you know what ought do you have in your
[19:20] basket right it would just be is there
[19:22] anything in your basket it's a real
[19:24] general term and Jesus uses it in a
[19:26] general way and I know that it's become
[19:27] part of our vernacular kind of demean
[19:29] when you've got uh you've got hatred or
[19:31] animosity against something but he's
[19:33] saying if you have anything against
[19:34] anyone and certainly it's applying to
[19:37] something that you would have to forgive
[19:39] or to let go
[19:41] because forgiveness is a deliberate
[19:43] letting go of something it's a conscious
[19:45] um uh dropping of resentment
[19:48] the conscious dropping of bitterness
[19:51] is I'm going to deliberately let go of
[19:55] this thought of Revenge where every day
[19:57] like I sure hope he wrecks his car I
[19:59] hope this happens to him what happens to
[20:00] him this is where you say you know what
[20:01] I'm just gonna let it go
[20:03] we know what it means to let it go right
[20:05] or at least we assume our children do
[20:06] when we constantly Just Let It Go just
[20:08] Let It Go just Let It Go it means it's
[20:11] deliberate I'm not going to worry about
[20:13] it I'm not going to obsess about it I'm
[20:14] not going to resent I'm not going to I'm
[20:16] not gonna Revenge I'm just gonna let it
[20:18] go
[20:19] because the opposite of forgiveness if
[20:21] we spend a lot of time on this we'd see
[20:22] that this scriptural principle of
[20:24] forgiveness and letting go means that
[20:27] you are the opposite of forgiveness
[20:28] would be resentment would be feelings of
[20:30] bitterness or to be vengeful to want
[20:32] revenge and so he's saying that we ought
[20:34] to let those things go and I think one
[20:37] of the best ways to kind of summarize
[20:40] the opposite of forgiveness would be
[20:42] holding a grudge
[20:44] it means you're holding something
[20:46] against someone now you can hold
[20:48] something against someone and you may be
[20:49] like well I don't resent them and I'm
[20:51] certainly not bitter and and I don't
[20:52] necessarily want revenge but you're
[20:54] holding it against them
[20:56] right there's something in your heart
[20:58] that you have this ought that you you uh
[21:01] that and I hope that you can think of it
[21:02] in your own personal way because maybe
[21:04] there's ways that I could use a language
[21:05] that you're like oh he's not talking
[21:07] about me
[21:08] right because I only want to slash their
[21:10] tires and he never mentioned that
[21:12] there's just a way that you ought to be
[21:14] able to think about it to where it's
[21:15] like he's talking about this feeling I
[21:17] have in my heart towards this person and
[21:19] it doesn't have to be you want them to
[21:21] die in their sleep it could just be
[21:22] something in your heart that you know
[21:24] I'm not that I've got this against them
[21:26] because of something they did to me
[21:28] and in James chapter 5 verse 9
[21:31] it says Grudge not one against another
[21:34] Brethren lest ye be condemned behold the
[21:38] judge standeth before the door that
[21:40] Grudge is uh in the
[21:43] in the Greek is speaking of a murmuring
[21:45] or complaining and a groaning that's
[21:47] what it's speaking of but it also and
[21:49] he's saying it's that which leads to
[21:51] condemnation and I like to think of the
[21:53] judge staying at the door being even our
[21:55] own hearts or judging us and we know
[21:57] that we've got something in our hearts
[21:59] it's a hurt it's an offense and let me
[22:01] be very clear again that what we're
[22:03] talking about in terms of forgiveness
[22:04] has nothing to do with pardoning or
[22:07] justifying the way the person acted
[22:10] it has nothing to do with justifying
[22:12] their behavior or condoning it or
[22:14] excusing it it's about you and your own
[22:16] heart holding that resentment and that
[22:18] bitterness against somebody else and he
[22:20] says and that's so there's a judging
[22:22] there to where it's condemning our own
[22:24] Hearts he says Grudge not against one
[22:26] another
[22:27] and it it's not just the complaining but
[22:30] it points back to what it means to
[22:32] Grudge which means to find fault with
[22:35] and it means to wish to deprive of it
[22:38] means to be angry
[22:40] a grudge is ill will that's caused by
[22:43] something when you hold a grudge against
[22:45] somebody I don't uh don't recall an
[22:48] instance where you ever held a grudge
[22:50] against somebody who gave you cash
[22:53] for no reason at all
[22:55] right
[22:56] so there's some behavior that was
[22:58] unwelcomed that was offensive that was
[23:00] hurtful and as a result of it we hold a
[23:03] grudge against them and just even that
[23:06] language you're holding
[23:08] a grudge you're carrying it with you to
[23:12] hold the grudge it means to maintain
[23:13] feelings of anger to maintain feelings
[23:16] of bitterness or resentment towards
[23:17] somebody for what they've done and to
[23:19] hold a grudge and to Grudge even implies
[23:21] a duration of time that's be that's
[23:24] that's not reasonable or that is longer
[23:27] than what one would expect that maybe in
[23:29] the moment you could be offended and for
[23:30] some time you may be hurt but there's a
[23:32] point at which what you're holding
[23:34] becomes a grudge
[23:35] it's the bitterness taking root that
[23:37] root of bitterness that begins to spring
[23:39] up and it will begin to defile you and
[23:41] so this hold in a grudge holding on to
[23:44] resentment harboring it in your heart
[23:46] holding it within the as the scripture
[23:48] says the innermost parts of the belly it
[23:51] is very painful and harmful to do so
[23:55] and if I could say this that holding a
[23:58] grudge it it has hostility with it when
[24:01] you Grudge something there's hostility
[24:03] implied in that it comes with the price
[24:06] if you are holding resentment in your
[24:09] heart you may be justified in terms of
[24:13] being offended you may have been hurt
[24:15] not of your own accord there's maybe a
[24:18] lot of ways that we could look at the
[24:19] actual offense and the fact that you
[24:20] were hurt and we're not we're not
[24:22] talking about that but it's the
[24:23] resentment and bitterness that you now
[24:24] hold in your heart and you pay a price
[24:27] for that
[24:29] I have a visual of a hook here I want
[24:31] you to look at
[24:33] and think about this this is a statement
[24:34] I read about unforgiveness because when
[24:36] you think about
[24:37] uh forgiving somebody
[24:40] then you're letting something go and
[24:43] this is this this is a phrase this is a
[24:45] statement I read one time that here
[24:46] recently very tremendous unforgiveness
[24:48] is like being on a giant hook
[24:51] you
[24:52] run a giant Hook when you have not
[24:54] forgiven somebody you're on a hook next
[24:57] to you on the hook is the person who's
[24:59] hurt you
[25:00] now if you could think about it this way
[25:02] you go on the hook first
[25:04] and now the person who's offended you is
[25:06] on the hook next
[25:08] so now you're on the hook they're on the
[25:10] hook and I I didn't think I couldn't
[25:12] think of a
[25:13] a way to represent that without maybe us
[25:15] getting a little bit queasy right
[25:17] so you you've been hooked
[25:21] right through the gills and somebody
[25:23] else has been hooked as well right there
[25:25] next to you on the hook is the person
[25:26] that hurt you the hook is extremely
[25:28] painful
[25:30] wherever you go so does the hook
[25:32] and so does the offender
[25:34] the only way you can get off the hook
[25:36] yourself
[25:38] is to allow the offender off first
[25:41] and this is the phrase the cost of not
[25:43] allowing the fender off the hook is
[25:45] perhaps a lifetime of unhappiness
[25:50] will follow us and follow us and follow
[25:52] us and I think there's a lot that we
[25:54] could point to in the scripture and the
[25:56] word of God to show how clear this
[25:57] principle is there's a lot that follows
[26:00] us and we and it's going to follow us
[26:02] until we're willing to forgive the
[26:04] offender
[26:05] and then they're off the hook and you
[26:07] can get off the hook yourself
[26:09] I think we said Sunday unforgiveness is
[26:11] a terrible disease
[26:13] and it's a disease that's going to
[26:14] corrupt your emotions it's going to
[26:16] color your feelings and and your
[26:18] experiences and not only is it going to
[26:20] do something in your emotions but it it
[26:21] actually can sicken your body
[26:24] and this is where I feel that I
[26:25] absolutely needed to address this in the
[26:27] subject of Divine Healing and Christ my
[26:30] healer is because sometimes it's sin
[26:32] that causes our sickness and it's a lack
[26:34] of forgiveness that'll keep us sick
[26:38] but the bottom of the sermon why he says
[26:40] our number one heart disease
[26:42] doesn't he says the main thing that
[26:44] kills the people to date
[26:46] and and that still is the number one
[26:48] killer of humans today is heart disease
[26:50] he says it's he says it's number one sin
[26:52] disease
[26:54] and what a beautiful way of looking at
[26:55] that they would say the physical number
[26:57] one killer of humans today are heart
[26:59] diseases or heart disease but think
[27:02] about even what has caused that sin but
[27:04] then he's looking at the real killer syn
[27:07] disease and sin is unbelief unbelief in
[27:09] what the Bible that's right yes it's the
[27:11] number one sin disease that kills people
[27:13] today both spiritually and
[27:16] physically I know it's a fragment here
[27:18] but physically and notice how he puts
[27:20] this
[27:21] um in this scripture and that'll in this
[27:24] statement and that'll make them kill
[27:26] them
[27:27] physically of course
[27:29] because they already can prove this is
[27:32] in 1963 they can already prove that a
[27:34] man that holds grudges and women who
[27:36] fuss and stew and fight and argue they
[27:38] die and I know you're like well
[27:41] duh
[27:42] they die prematurely
[27:44] they die as a result of the fussing and
[27:47] stew and the fighting and argument they
[27:49] die as a result of the grudges that's
[27:51] what's directly implied by this
[27:53] statement is that men that hold grudges
[27:55] and women who fuss and stew and fine
[27:57] argue they die he's not making a
[27:59] statement like I told my children one
[28:00] time everyone who fought in the Civil
[28:01] War died and like what you're like well
[28:04] yeah there's none that are still living
[28:06] today
[28:07] but this is the direct result of
[28:10] grudging fussing stewing fighting and
[28:13] arguing it'll cause cancer fungus think
[28:16] of bacterial infections you just think
[28:19] of all different ways that you could
[28:20] amplify that it'll cause cancer fungus
[28:22] fungus everything else will set in
[28:24] ulcers
[28:27] and these sicknesses then in the body
[28:29] he's tied directly to unbelief
[28:32] he's tied it directly to grudges fussing
[28:35] stewing fighting and arguing to fuss is
[28:38] to be agitated
[28:40] to fuss is actually when there's a fuss
[28:42] there's a resentment there I went and
[28:44] looked into the the just the history of
[28:46] the words and their meanings and
[28:47] definitions that to Stew it's that this
[28:49] agitation you're worried you're
[28:51] concerned about something
[28:53] and if I could say this
[28:55] and I trust the Lord will help me to
[28:57] amplify these things very succinctly
[29:00] that the fussing the stewing the
[29:02] bitterness the anger there's no
[29:04] justification for any of it
[29:08] you cannot find in the scripture where
[29:10] the the word of God says it's okay for
[29:14] you to have an A fussing stewing
[29:16] grudging fighting arguing spirit
[29:20] and there are certain states of minds or
[29:22] certain states of consciousness of a
[29:24] Christian that we can never justify as
[29:26] Christians
[29:27] we can never we can never justify it now
[29:30] you may have your own justifications for
[29:34] it
[29:35] but your justifications for it cannot
[29:37] alleviate you of the consequences for it
[29:40] you can have a whole lot of constant
[29:42] justifications for what you do uh but
[29:44] there's there's you say well I'm really
[29:46] really thirsty so I went and I grabbed
[29:47] this and I drank it and and and and to
[29:50] satiate my thirst it turns out it was
[29:52] poison so it doesn't matter what your
[29:54] reasons for taking and drinking it were
[29:56] there's a consequence for drinking
[29:58] poison
[29:59] that's a very importantness for us to
[30:01] realize that there's certain states of
[30:02] minds and emotions and attitudes that we
[30:04] hold that are poison to us
[30:07] and that in holding them in our hearts
[30:09] we can't hold them without consequence
[30:13] and our anger and our bitterness and our
[30:14] resentment it's drinking poison
[30:16] and don't think that you can hold
[30:18] hostility in your heart towards anyone
[30:22] and not think that you're the one that's
[30:24] being poisoned by it
[30:27] if I could quote brother Mark Twain at
[30:28] least he's given the credit for saying
[30:31] this anger is an acid that can do more
[30:33] harm to the vessel in which it is stored
[30:35] than to anything on which it is poured
[30:39] about anger
[30:41] anger will do more to the vessel who's
[30:44] holding it
[30:45] then to the person upon which it is
[30:47] directed
[30:49] it's an acid that if you hold within
[30:51] your heart it's corrupting you more than
[30:54] you're seething stowing anger towards
[30:57] that other person is
[30:59] and when brother Branham takes this
[31:01] heart disease looks at it from another
[31:03] angle calling it sin disease and then
[31:05] says it's killing them physically not
[31:07] just Spirit you're not just spiritually
[31:09] dying but you're also physically dying
[31:11] because the very Act of holding a grudge
[31:14] fussing and stewing fighting and arguing
[31:16] he says they can prove causes sickness
[31:20] and brother Branham is pointing to the
[31:22] impact of forgiveness on our well-being
[31:25] or maybe said another way he's pointing
[31:26] to the impact and the effect of not
[31:29] forgiving on our well-being
[31:31] that if we do not forgive it comes with
[31:34] the consequence
[31:36] and this is maybe very logical to think
[31:38] of it this way
[31:39] that if we Harbor emotions of anger
[31:42] hatred bitterness fussing stewing
[31:44] holding grudges
[31:46] that creates an emotional state
[31:50] and that even subconsciously you could
[31:52] be holding things anybody ever wake up
[31:53] with a headache and wonder why and oh
[31:56] I'm real because sometimes you can be so
[31:57] stressed out intense you clinked your
[31:59] teeth right and you're constantly you
[32:01] may not even feel stressed out but your
[32:03] body is stressed you're clenching your
[32:05] teeth you're holding your muscles real
[32:06] tight you're tensing up and it causes
[32:08] physical pain because of your emotional
[32:09] condition
[32:10] is impacting you in your physical body
[32:13] and there's certain states of mind the
[32:15] state of chronic anxiety a state of
[32:17] being chronic constantly under stress
[32:20] it's been proven I don't think I need to
[32:22] prove this part at all but those states
[32:24] of mind and those mental conditions
[32:25] they've proven or toxic to physical
[32:27] health
[32:29] and and specifically this is what they
[32:32] identify you're at an increased risk of
[32:34] heart disease
[32:36] with these certain states of chronic
[32:38] anxiety and stress
[32:39] and that's exactly what brother Brown is
[32:41] pointing to say well the number one
[32:42] killer is heart disease but he says
[32:44] there's also there's a there's an
[32:45] emotional component
[32:48] to this
[32:49] that that's causing this
[32:52] and he says they can already prove so
[32:53] when he says they can already approve
[32:55] this is a reference to some process of
[32:57] proving some study to where there's
[32:59] we've looked into this and we've tried
[33:01] to find out if there's some sort of
[33:02] causation related to these states of
[33:05] fussing and Steward and fighting and
[33:07] arguing to sicknesses and so he's saying
[33:10] that they can prove a causal connection
[33:11] between
[33:13] uh grudging fussing stewing fighting and
[33:16] arguing to cancer and these other
[33:18] stressors and ulcers
[33:19] and today we'd say right they can prove
[33:22] this
[33:24] what's remarkable is at the time there
[33:26] wasn't a lot of study on it
[33:29] and it's specifically with the grudges
[33:33] holding a grudge fussing and doing
[33:34] fighting and arguing he he's he's not
[33:38] specifically just pointing a ham if
[33:40] you're really going through a difficult
[33:41] time and times are really stressful and
[33:43] you don't have a lot of money and you've
[33:44] got this problem you've got that problem
[33:45] you know that that causes chronic heart
[33:47] conditions or going to cause this
[33:48] nervous tension it's going to cause
[33:49] stress it's going to cause high blood
[33:51] pressure in these things he's talking
[33:53] about your my your attitude towards
[33:56] somebody else
[33:57] fussing stewing fighting arguing holding
[34:00] grudges
[34:01] look at how what he talks about crowning
[34:04] your life by complaining and being
[34:05] crabby
[34:06] he's pointing to this and it's only been
[34:09] over the past five decades going back to
[34:11] the 70s where research has uncovered a
[34:14] link between health and unforgiveness
[34:17] and in these studies I've read in these
[34:19] synopsis of these Studies have been
[34:21] looking at the goal of these studies was
[34:23] to identify the effect of forgiveness on
[34:25] a person's physical health and their
[34:27] Mental Health
[34:29] specifically what these Studies have
[34:30] been looking at is how does holding
[34:32] grudges how does holding resentment in
[34:34] business how does never letting someone
[34:37] off the hook and yourself off the hook
[34:39] impact the way someone is emotionally
[34:41] and physically so it has to do with
[34:42] mental health it has to do with physical
[34:44] health
[34:45] and this is the conclusion they came to
[34:47] people who forgive are happier and
[34:49] healthier than those who don't
[34:51] know I'm doing this to amplify the fact
[34:54] that in 1963 brother Brown says it's
[34:56] physically killing you to fost astute to
[34:59] hold argues to fight to hold grudges to
[35:01] fight and argue
[35:03] it's causing all sorts of things from
[35:04] ulcers all the way to cancer and
[35:06] everything in between this is something
[35:08] he says they can already prove it and
[35:10] science has since the 70s just on the
[35:12] subject of forgiveness alone is saying
[35:15] people who forgive are happier and
[35:16] healthier than those who don't
[35:18] they have found that people who are more
[35:20] forgiving have fewer illnesses
[35:23] and those that are less forgiving have
[35:26] more health problems
[35:28] this is something that they have been
[35:29] able to objectively uh map out the more
[35:32] forgiven you are the less illnesses you
[35:34] have the less forgiving the more health
[35:36] problems they've noticed that in people
[35:38] who are forgiven or people who exercise
[35:40] forgiveness leaving one study it was
[35:42] just people who thought about
[35:44] forgiveness
[35:45] they noticed improved cardiovascular
[35:48] functioning nervous system functioning
[35:50] when exercising or even thinking about
[35:52] forgiveness
[35:54] these are physical metrics that sign
[35:55] science can look at a person's heart
[35:57] rate or blood pressure and they can get
[35:59] them to even just begin to think about
[36:01] thoughts of forgiving somebody and it
[36:03] improves a person's function of their
[36:05] heart or their nervous system
[36:08] the University of Wisconsin they did a
[36:11] scientific study on forgiveness in the
[36:12] 1980s and it began to be one of the most
[36:15] groundbreaking studies as it was
[36:17] published
[36:18] and the University of Wisconsin I think
[36:20] has a forgiveness Institute
[36:22] and the international forgiveness
[36:23] Institute Dr Enright is the professor
[36:26] that heads that up and this is what they
[36:28] they did it this is their conclusion of
[36:30] the study in the 80s offering
[36:32] forgiveness to others reduces clinical
[36:34] levels of anger and depression and
[36:36] raises self-esteem
[36:39] let's not forget that we're talking
[36:40] about a very clear scriptural principle
[36:43] to forgive
[36:45] somebody who's hurt you somebody who's
[36:47] harmed you
[36:48] and there's I don't believe that there's
[36:50] any truth today that we can't bring back
[36:52] to the Bible
[36:54] I know that may be a pretty broad
[36:56] statement but we're talking about truth
[36:58] he says it reduced they conclude it
[37:00] reduces clinical levels of anger and
[37:01] depression to raise the self-esteem to
[37:03] offer forgiveness to others
[37:05] and they have amassed since this time
[37:07] volumes of evidence that the physical
[37:09] and psychological benefits of
[37:10] forgiveness volumes enough to write a
[37:13] book on it where they can have a whole
[37:15] book that just goes over the studies and
[37:16] the conclusions of it and if you take
[37:19] together what we ministered on Sunday
[37:20] and the the few things that we've tried
[37:23] to put back into the record today and
[37:24] take a step forward and today I believe
[37:26] that we could show that the word of God
[37:28] has already established the direct
[37:29] connection between your state of mind
[37:32] and your well-being and forgiveness
[37:34] it's already a direct connection if
[37:36] you're physically sick then we would be
[37:38] taught in the word of God that if you
[37:40] are physically sick that you ought to
[37:41] seek to be forgiven of anything you've
[37:43] done wrong and if you're going to ask
[37:45] God for anything you should forgive
[37:46] other people also and James said that
[37:49] you may be healed
[37:51] and and Jesus is saying that your
[37:53] heavenly father would forgive you also
[37:54] and there's so many things that we can
[37:56] take in the Proverbs and take to the
[37:58] scripture taking personal experience
[37:59] take from the message of the hour to
[38:01] show that there's a direct Connection in
[38:03] your attitude towards other people and
[38:06] your physical and mental well-being and
[38:08] now science I could say agrees but
[38:09] science is uncovering it themselves
[38:12] Hope College in Michigan was looking at
[38:15] the effects of forgiveness versus
[38:16] holding a grudge and this is one of
[38:18] their conclusions forgiveness May free
[38:19] the wounded person from a prison of hurt
[38:22] in vengeful emotion yielding both
[38:24] emotional and physical benefits
[38:26] including reduced stress less less
[38:29] negative emotion fewer cardiovascular
[38:32] problems and improved immune system
[38:33] performance
[38:36] forgiveness frees the wounded person
[38:40] you may think that what you need is an
[38:43] all-out
[38:44] uh no qualifications open face apology
[38:49] from the offender
[38:51] in order for you to be free from their
[38:53] prison but you can be free on your own
[38:55] accord by forgiving
[38:57] without even an apology on their part
[38:59] you can free yourself you can forgive
[39:02] them and you can get off the hook also
[39:03] and you put way too much power still in
[39:06] the offender's hands to be to bring you
[39:08] down and carry it this unhappiness to
[39:10] carry this Grudge and you're putting
[39:12] they will just apologize if they would
[39:13] just apologize I wouldn't have to die
[39:15] from this and all you have to do is
[39:17] forgive them
[39:19] showing that you have more power
[39:21] showing that you have the character
[39:22] showing that you haven't been destroyed
[39:24] that you haven't been forsaken that I
[39:26] could stand upon the promise of who I am
[39:28] and this and forgiveness will even
[39:30] elevate your own self-esteem you free
[39:32] the Forgiveness freeze the the victim
[39:34] freeze the wounded
[39:36] from a prison of hurt and vengeful
[39:38] emotion
[39:39] and it yields an emotional and physical
[39:41] benefit
[39:43] in the next slide research has shown
[39:44] that forgiveness is linked to mental
[39:46] health outcomes such as reduced anxiety
[39:49] depression in major psychiatric
[39:51] disorders
[39:53] as well as with fewer physical health
[39:55] symptoms and a lower mortality rates
[39:58] this is a conclusion another study
[40:00] reduced anxiety this is think about this
[40:02] reduced anxiety depression and major
[40:04] psychiatric disorders and fewer physical
[40:06] health problems and lower mortality
[40:08] rates
[40:10] lower mortality rates from what
[40:11] forgiveness research has shown that
[40:14] forgiveness is linked to lower mortality
[40:16] rates
[40:18] it's exactly what brother Branham is
[40:19] saying the people who don't forget die
[40:21] early
[40:22] right people who don't forgive hold
[40:25] grudges he's saying that they have
[40:26] higher mortality rates
[40:28] if you're just going to put it in a more
[40:30] scientific language they can already
[40:32] prove that men that hold grudges have
[40:34] higher mortality rates than those who
[40:36] don't
[40:36] and now we come to the science of the
[40:38] last five decades and they're saying we
[40:40] can see that there's a link
[40:42] between forgiveness and mental health
[40:44] outcomes that even relate to lower
[40:46] mortality rates
[40:49] people who are taught how to forgive
[40:50] become less angry feel less hurt are
[40:54] more optimistic
[40:58] become more forgiven in a variety of
[41:00] situations and become more compassionate
[41:02] and self-confident
[41:05] this is remarkable now I'm just
[41:08] referencing scientific studies that have
[41:10] looked at the act of forgiveness which
[41:12] is a very scriptural principle which
[41:15] it's a
[41:16] uh it's something maybe we haven't spent
[41:19] a lot of time on but I hope that we can
[41:20] all just accept we're referring to a
[41:22] very scriptural principle
[41:24] to forgive
[41:25] and the benefits it has upon the human
[41:27] body
[41:28] so this forgiveness is something that's
[41:30] divine
[41:31] is something that God does it's
[41:33] something that we can see is related to
[41:35] the the creator of the human body and
[41:38] God has made you in such a way toward
[41:40] the act of letting go of something will
[41:42] improve your physical health
[41:46] people who forgive are less angry less
[41:47] hurt more optimistic more self-confident
[41:51] this is a statement from Dr Robert
[41:53] Enright the
[41:55] the head of the international
[41:56] forgiveness Institute
[41:58] the heroic nature of forgiveness is you
[42:00] try I love even the way he phrased it
[42:03] the heroic nature of forgiveness
[42:06] is you try even a little bit to be good
[42:08] to the other person who wronged you
[42:11] he says so when even a little bit when
[42:13] you try the Hope nature forgiveness is
[42:15] you try he says and we find through our
[42:17] science
[42:19] I think this may be the next slide but
[42:21] John that a lot of physiological
[42:23] well-being visits the one who's ready
[42:26] and willing to choose forgiveness
[42:28] this is I mean this we find through
[42:30] science so this Dr Enright is saying
[42:33] that there's something about forgiving
[42:34] and the power of forgiveness that when
[42:36] we forgive and we try to do good or we
[42:38] try to get them off the hook if I could
[42:40] put in those words we find through
[42:42] science that a lot of
[42:44] psychological well-being visits the one
[42:47] who's ready and willing to choose
[42:48] forgiveness
[42:50] and he continues to describe uh there's
[42:53] a lot of different situations that
[42:55] they've used
[42:57] in in Nations that have been War torn
[42:59] and there's been acts of genocide and
[43:00] there's been very specific uh
[43:02] characteristic terroristic things done
[43:04] uh direct hurts where even they're able
[43:07] to bring people who are the terrorists
[43:08] and those who've been impacted by it in
[43:10] these African countries in a lot of
[43:12] different places they've done these
[43:13] studies very real world scientific
[43:15] studies of people who've been hurt and
[43:16] been harmed and the power and and the
[43:18] the one who's been the the offender and
[43:21] the one that's been the offended and
[43:22] they've looked at and examined the
[43:24] process of offering forgiveness to the
[43:26] one who's hurt you and they've been able
[43:28] to look at this and they've used
[43:30] examples of people who have been the
[43:32] atrocities done against them
[43:34] they're they're just even to the way I
[43:37] couldn't even describe them in public to
[43:39] you and this doctor concluded that a lot
[43:41] of he says people who have been
[43:43] brutalized by life
[43:45] when they willingly it's the next slide
[43:47] willingly choose to forgive
[43:50] people who've been brutalized by life
[43:52] to the people who just kind of gone
[43:54] through a rough day and they have a boss
[43:55] who's a little bit too demanding people
[43:57] have been brutalized by life when they
[43:59] willingly choose to forgive depression
[44:01] can go down anxiety go down
[44:03] post-traumatic stress can go down toxic
[44:06] anger can go down and you know what goes
[44:09] up
[44:10] self-esteem
[44:12] he said well that that that's science no
[44:14] that's how God's made the human body
[44:17] science is only making the observations
[44:20] this isn't a scientific formula this
[44:22] isn't science trying to tell us how we
[44:23] got here they got their theories in
[44:25] terms of how we got here by a big bang
[44:27] or something but now they're looking at
[44:28] how everything's unfolded and these are
[44:31] observable effects upon a person that
[44:33] when they exercise forgiveness even
[44:35] people who've been brutalized by life
[44:37] when they willingly choose to forgive
[44:39] depression can go down anxiety go down
[44:42] post-traumatic stress can go down toxic
[44:44] anger can go down and your self-esteem
[44:46] can go up
[44:48] why because it's just a truth
[44:51] that relates to the person
[44:53] that the Bible has been telling us about
[44:55] for centuries
[44:57] it's the very reason why Jesus says in
[44:59] Mark 11 25 and when you stand praying
[45:01] forgive
[45:04] to forgive it's an expression of divine
[45:07] faith
[45:08] I want you to look at that way you're
[45:10] you're willing to forgive is an
[45:12] expression of your faith not weakness
[45:15] it's an expression of divine faith is an
[45:17] expression of the love and nature of
[45:18] Christ to forgive somebody who has hurt
[45:21] you and again this may be a very narrow
[45:23] context and I'm and I'm bringing it up
[45:24] within the subject matter of our
[45:26] physical healing and so this may become
[45:27] applicable sometime to you it may be
[45:30] relevant right now for some of us to
[45:32] realize wow my PTSD is directly related
[45:35] to the fact that I'm holding on to the
[45:38] things that have been done to me
[45:40] I'm not choosing to forgive and
[45:43] therefore my depression and anxiety in
[45:46] this state of anger maintains this
[45:48] consistent level and what I really need
[45:50] to do is stop it stop trying to bury it
[45:53] or stop obsessing about it and just
[45:55] forgive
[45:56] and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna uh
[46:00] I guess I'm trying to find the right
[46:02] word I'm not going to disrespect you by
[46:04] implying that you need to move on or get
[46:06] over it
[46:08] that's not assumed at all in forgiveness
[46:11] it's just it's the act of forgiving
[46:12] letting it go
[46:14] maybe there's not maybe it's not
[46:16] entirely built upon this idea that well
[46:18] I forgive them and and you're forgiven
[46:21] you don't have the power to remove the
[46:24] consequence
[46:27] people when they act and they do things
[46:29] you can forgive somebody but that
[46:31] doesn't mean you have to go uh you have
[46:33] to go defend you have to go up here at
[46:35] the parole here and say well I I forgave
[46:37] them so I guess you should let him out
[46:38] of prison
[46:40] forgiveness isn't forgiveness is
[46:42] something you do in your heart
[46:45] it's letting go of any desire to see uh
[46:49] uh to to require some exacting of blood
[46:53] or Revenge
[46:55] for you to be whole
[46:57] to be able to go go and be healed
[47:01] and the message perfect faith
[47:03] and I'm making a little bit of a pivot
[47:05] here
[47:09] because
[47:10] none of us stand here is sinless
[47:14] so I need to say I'm sorry
[47:17] and none of us I mean I'd even go as far
[47:20] as these young men on the front row
[47:21] they've lived long enough to be able to
[47:23] forgive somebody else
[47:25] so we all would stand in the position
[47:26] either to be the one that has offended
[47:28] or the one that has been offended
[47:33] and I think this scripture or this
[47:35] statement is so beautiful because it can
[47:37] address us as the one who's done
[47:38] something wrong
[47:40] and when we were Sinners alienated
[47:42] without God in the world and that muck
[47:44] of mud as I talked about this morning
[47:46] God came to us
[47:48] God sought you you never sought God
[47:53] no man can come to me except the father
[47:55] draws him first
[47:57] and God came down in that muck what you
[47:59] were and sought you out and brought you
[48:01] out that ought to create
[48:04] a perfect love
[48:06] look at what you were and look what you
[48:08] are what did that
[48:10] somebody that loved you could we do that
[48:13] tonight the grace that has placed Us in
[48:15] this church tonight to be sitting in
[48:17] these chairs hearing the word of God to
[48:19] think what did that to me a God that
[48:23] loved me what has kept you through all
[48:25] the turns and all the disappointments
[48:27] and all the health battles all the
[48:29] emotional difficulties all the
[48:30] relationship changes everything that
[48:32] you've endured I I'm sure that there's
[48:34] somebody somewhere who has their fantasy
[48:36] league of Believers never thought that
[48:38] you would make it this far
[48:40] ah right there's no way in the world
[48:42] they're going to make it there's no way
[48:44] they're going to keep going they might
[48:45] have thought since you didn't go to
[48:46] their church anymore that you were
[48:48] backslid and you ran away and you're
[48:49] lost but look where you are
[48:51] still believing still hold on what did
[48:54] that somebody that loved you did that
[48:57] if you could just recognize the love of
[48:59] God that pursues you he says can't you
[49:01] have faith in what he's promised you
[49:03] then
[49:03] what is what is he wanting to point your
[49:06] faith to not how good you are not your
[49:10] sickness not not all these other things
[49:12] to where it's your faith against the
[49:14] sickness he's wanting to bring you all
[49:15] the way back to a forgiveness all the
[49:18] way back to a God who who sent the
[49:20] sacrifice of his son who shed blood has
[49:23] Justified you picked you up out of the
[49:25] muck of mud and he says what changed you
[49:28] he said love did that and if God can
[49:31] forgive you of your sins justify you and
[49:34] place his spirit inside of you then
[49:36] can't you have faith in the other things
[49:38] he's promised
[49:41] a real genuine love will create a
[49:43] confidence in his word
[49:47] and maybe it's this statement that turns
[49:49] the focus directly on all of us whether
[49:51] we need forgiveness or we need to
[49:54] forgive because sometimes the hardest
[49:56] person to forgive is ourselves
[50:00] and we're way too hard on ourselves and
[50:03] and and not only are we just too hard on
[50:05] ourselves we don't ever give ourselves
[50:06] the benefit of the doubt we're never
[50:08] going to let ourselves off the hook
[50:09] we're never gonna we never think our
[50:11] sorry is good enough we're and you just
[50:13] keep and you're not even willing to
[50:14] accept the Forgiveness of your savior
[50:18] and a Divine love that is so perfect to
[50:20] complete
[50:21] and maybe who we need to forgive as
[50:23] ourselves
[50:27] what did that somebody that loved you in
[50:29] Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 6 it says for
[50:31] in Christ Jesus Christ neither
[50:33] circumcision of eileth anything nor
[50:35] uncircumcision what matters what avails
[50:38] what counts Faith which worketh by love
[50:43] Faith which is operative it's at work
[50:45] Faith which is just to display one's
[50:48] activity which is the word faith which
[50:49] displays its activity by love
[50:53] faith is displayed by love
[50:56] and as we've taken the time to these
[50:58] last two services and I say maybe a
[51:00] little bit more and sowing some of the
[51:01] breadcrumbs to this the scriptures
[51:03] connect the prayer of faith shall save
[51:06] the sick to forgiveness
[51:08] asking and having faith in God it
[51:10] connects it back to forgiveness this
[51:12] asking this uh this Desiring When you
[51:16] pray you see so much comes back to this
[51:18] idea and this concept of forgiveness
[51:20] and so that whether we are asking for
[51:23] forgiveness or whether we are granting
[51:24] it the scriptures connecting that
[51:27] principle to what we receive
[51:29] and we ask in faith believing
[51:33] and faith is connected to love
[51:36] it says faith which worketh by love
[51:38] Faith manifests its power through love
[51:43] and what took you out of the mud and
[51:45] made you what you are today love did
[51:49] forgiveness did
[51:52] in the message perfect faith brother
[51:53] Rama says that faith is the master of
[51:55] all circumstances
[51:57] and faith and love is relation because
[51:59] you can't have faith unless you got love
[52:01] because your faith is in a God is the
[52:04] very essence of love Faith and love work
[52:06] together
[52:08] I'm wanting to if I could express it
[52:10] this way I mentioned it a moment ago I'm
[52:12] wanting you to look at that you have to
[52:14] have faith and I think it's just really
[52:16] beautiful and I if I fail to if it
[52:18] doesn't come out in a way that uh it
[52:20] makes sense to you it's my fault okay
[52:22] but
[52:24] when I think about how we're we need
[52:25] faith for the moment we need Faith to be
[52:27] healed we need Faith to act whatever it
[52:29] is we need faith for and that faith and
[52:31] this love work together and so love is
[52:34] they're working together Faith Works by
[52:37] love or it's displays itself in the love
[52:40] that's being made manifest and then
[52:41] God's love for us was displayed in that
[52:45] he forgave us of our sins so you're
[52:47] wanting to have faith for your own
[52:49] healing and you can exercise that Faith
[52:52] by displaying love
[52:54] you can exercise that faith if you want
[52:57] to say I can exercise that Faith by
[52:58] displaying love back to God to trust God
[53:01] to believe in God but I'm even looking
[53:02] at the sense of your character your
[53:04] attitude how you treat other people if I
[53:07] could say this and I'm not saying it to
[53:08] be a joke if you want to be healed be
[53:10] nice
[53:11] [Music]
[53:12] we say God brother bam says in another
[53:14] places God heals by kind words and maybe
[53:17] we always thought that meant words
[53:18] people say to us but maybe it's your own
[53:20] words
[53:22] maybe we thought well if somebody would
[53:23] just say something nice to me I'd be
[53:25] healed of this chronic condition maybe
[53:26] if you would just say something nice to
[53:28] somebody else you could be healed of
[53:29] your chronic condition because an
[53:31] exercise of your faith is going to be
[53:34] displayed in your love the love that you
[53:36] have for one another the love that you
[53:38] have for Humanity
[53:39] right I say no wonder sicknesses are on
[53:43] the increase because everybody hates
[53:45] everybody
[53:48] it's there's so much there's such a
[53:51] state of agitation
[53:53] and people are getting more and more
[53:55] ridiculous as they get more and more
[53:56] polarized and entrenched and and we as
[53:59] Christians ought to be able to stand in
[54:01] such a way to where you're not going to
[54:03] make win everybody not everybody's going
[54:05] to agree with you and you're not gonna
[54:06] be able to make everybody happy but we
[54:08] don't have to become negative and
[54:10] cynical and bitter and critical like
[54:12] everybody else has become
[54:15] and we can demonstrate our love we can
[54:18] demonstrate our faith by practicing love
[54:21] to forgive
[54:23] people who've heard us and people have
[54:24] offended us
[54:26] in the sermon desperations brother says
[54:28] the only way that you can have faith is
[54:29] have love first
[54:31] because after all faith is Love's
[54:32] incentive
[54:34] it's a thing that motivates encourages
[54:35] one to do something
[54:37] this is the only place he says this and
[54:38] brings these two things together so he's
[54:41] not necessarily fully developing this
[54:43] thought so what at least what it does is
[54:44] it enters into our minds to begin to
[54:46] think about how faith and love work
[54:47] together and there's an incentive
[54:51] and the way that he says it Faith
[54:52] motivates love
[54:54] it motivates action
[54:57] incentive that's what faith is it's an
[54:59] incentive to love
[55:00] Faith motivates love Faith motivates
[55:03] action if you don't have love you can't
[55:05] have faith and you can't have faith in
[55:07] your wife if you don't love her
[55:09] he said how can you have faith in your
[55:11] wife if you don't love her and that's
[55:12] infilio now how about an agapa love
[55:15] agape love to God
[55:18] what an incredible principle
[55:21] I feel bad now for bringing it up at 8
[55:23] 18 on a Wednesday night because I need
[55:25] to end
[55:26] but what an amazing principle
[55:29] that in the way that I ought to be able
[55:30] to demonstrate myself towards my wife
[55:33] says even the filio that I can't have
[55:35] love I can't have faith in her if I
[55:38] don't love her and the love I have
[55:40] towards her develops his faith and it it
[55:42] inspires this faith and this confidence
[55:44] and then therefore this uh faith
[55:47] it motivates my love this confidence
[55:49] motivates my love and if I could say
[55:51] that it's God's love to us and through
[55:53] his love to us that he forgave us and we
[55:55] love him because he first loved us and I
[55:57] know this is just a just a part of it
[55:59] I'm trying to point us back to this
[56:00] forgiveness to be able to say I forgive
[56:03] you I forgive them I forgive to be able
[56:06] to say I forgive that is a function of
[56:09] love
[56:10] that's a function of our faith and he
[56:12] says just and again we're running out of
[56:15] time but just look in the old context of
[56:16] your relationships if you're not going
[56:18] to be willing to forgive your spouse
[56:20] then how could you even say you feel
[56:22] your love
[56:23] and think about what it does to a
[56:25] relationship when somebody when somebody
[56:28] Harbors something won't let it go and
[56:31] just lets it eat eat and eat and
[56:33] somebody may do something very very very
[56:35] very very wrong but the power is in the
[56:38] person's heart to Out of Love forgive
[56:41] and not be bound or on that hook anymore
[56:44] and he said we've got to be able to do
[56:46] that with one another
[56:48] well last time it was where he says if
[56:50] you kept from your heart
[56:54] when you can't forgive every person from
[56:56] the very depths of your heart no matter
[56:58] what they've done or what they've said
[56:59] he says something's wrong
[57:02] if you can't forgive them from the depth
[57:05] just talking about forgiveness
[57:08] if somebody if I if if I borrowed your
[57:10] car let's say if I borrowed uh brother
[57:13] brother Micah's Tesla and I just
[57:15] shattered the rims on a curb
[57:18] he could forgive me of that right
[57:21] absolutely forgive me of that but that
[57:24] doesn't mean he needs to give me the
[57:26] biometric card or whatever it is you use
[57:28] to start a Tesla it doesn't mean he has
[57:31] to let me drive his car again right over
[57:34] there and I love you I trust you your
[57:36] wonderful friend and I completely
[57:38] forgive you but why don't you live you
[57:39] land the car again well I'm just using
[57:42] more reason this time and more I'm
[57:43] exercising discretion or whatever it
[57:45] might be and so the act of forgiveness
[57:47] let's not assume
[57:49] what that means going forward let's not
[57:51] try to figure out what the consequences
[57:53] are going to be just think of how much
[57:55] Freedom there's going to be in your own
[57:56] life and how much more access you can
[57:59] have to the faith you need for your
[58:00] healing or the answers you need to give
[58:02] get when you can just forgive
[58:05] yeah I think some people have Twisted
[58:06] forgiveness so much that they think
[58:07] forgiveness is just continuing to stay
[58:09] in the situation they're in and get beat
[58:11] up over and over and over and over again
[58:13] and they don't they're not willing to
[58:15] make the changes they need to
[58:17] spiritually Thrive because they don't
[58:18] understand what forgiveness is
[58:23] what about God's love
[58:26] hey that's that's that's the comparison
[58:28] he's making what about God's love in
[58:30] First Peter Chapter 4 verses 8 to 9.
[58:33] just leaving this scripture here maybe
[58:35] just touch on it very very quickly
[58:37] above all things have fervent charity
[58:40] among yourselves
[58:41] Above All Things the guy Peter's place
[58:43] in this this is the Capstone that we
[58:45] could say to the Statue of a perfect man
[58:47] that we Above All Things ought to have
[58:50] Paul would even place it above all we're
[58:52] seeking after charity I'll just the the
[58:55] the the harmony amongst the scriptures
[58:57] here above all things have fervent
[58:59] charity among yourselves
[59:01] and it says for charity shall cover the
[59:04] multitude of sins
[59:06] what a statement
[59:08] Charities shall cover the multitude of
[59:11] sins
[59:13] I believe that speaks to our forgiveness
[59:17] not that we justify a pardon or hide but
[59:20] it shall cover the multitude of sins and
[59:22] then it says use Hospitality one to
[59:24] another without grudging
[59:28] that if we can have this fervent charity
[59:30] among ourselves then we'd be able to
[59:32] serve one another live for others
[59:34] without The Grudge
[59:37] without the resentment
[59:39] and what is being what what forgiveness
[59:42] is when it says Let There Be fervent
[59:44] charity among yourselves for charity
[59:45] shall cover the multitude of sins this
[59:47] is an expression of Christian love a
[59:48] kind of love that can forgive offenses
[59:50] against ourselves
[59:53] this is what the scripture is refer to
[59:55] Charities shall cover the multitude it
[59:57] says Let There have this fervent charity
[59:58] among yourselves because we're going to
[1:00:00] need this kind of love to exist with one
[1:00:02] another seriously just think about it
[1:00:03] we've had we've been a church for just
[1:00:05] two years now some of you have been
[1:00:06] fellowship with this much shorter than
[1:00:08] that we've only been a church for two
[1:00:09] years and listen that's all you need
[1:00:12] to rub somebody the wrong way is a
[1:00:14] couple years
[1:00:15] right
[1:00:16] there really is no honeymoon period when
[1:00:18] it comes to
[1:00:24] Finn the wrong way hit a soft spot and
[1:00:26] we've all got to have it if we're gonna
[1:00:28] be a Christian church if you're going to
[1:00:29] be the body of Christ that's going to
[1:00:31] thrive you can't get that prickly
[1:00:33] corrosive kind of nature where unless
[1:00:35] everybody just treats you perfectly
[1:00:36] you're never going to be happy we've got
[1:00:38] to start having the love of God in our
[1:00:40] hearts
[1:00:41] right I'm sick and tired of pastoring
[1:00:44] people who don't have to love a God in
[1:00:45] their heart
[1:00:46] right
[1:00:48] no we've got to have the love of God our
[1:00:50] hearts toward one another we've got to
[1:00:52] have fervent charity
[1:00:54] some of you don't know what I was
[1:00:55] quoting somebody so
[1:00:59] we've got to have this kind of love for
[1:01:01] one another
[1:01:02] for others if we're to do good unto all
[1:01:04] men
[1:01:06] I say you're doing good when you can
[1:01:07] forgive people
[1:01:10] letting it go
[1:01:13] I think I mentioned this on Sunday and
[1:01:14] I'm going to close
[1:01:16] now have you just uh
[1:01:19] one more statement I want to read from
[1:01:21] the perfect faith
[1:01:22] but this so astounded me here recently
[1:01:24] to recognize
[1:01:26] that the word agape love that we use of
[1:01:29] this love of a higher intelligence
[1:01:31] a love that is used that is associated
[1:01:33] with God and brother Brown makes that
[1:01:35] division that feel or love is more this
[1:01:37] visceral feeling emotion this passion
[1:01:39] that we have in our in our flesh that
[1:01:41] you might love something and it it's
[1:01:43] more of that it's an Earthly love and
[1:01:45] takes agape love and he makes it more of
[1:01:47] a Heavenly love it's a love of higher
[1:01:49] intelligence a love with purpose
[1:01:51] and one of the elements to agape love
[1:01:55] it involves offering love to somebody
[1:01:58] when it's hard to do it
[1:02:01] that's what that's that's what makes
[1:02:03] agape love what it is
[1:02:05] it's really easy to love the guy who
[1:02:08] gives you a cash gift for no reason
[1:02:10] right like I love that guy just always
[1:02:12] giving me hundreds
[1:02:14] hey that that that's not that's not
[1:02:16] agape love that might just be common
[1:02:18] sense right
[1:02:20] that's a filial love but love of a
[1:02:23] higher intelligence is to be able to
[1:02:25] offer love to someone when it's hard to
[1:02:28] or when somebody doesn't necessarily in
[1:02:31] our own estimation deserve it
[1:02:33] come on somebody
[1:02:35] isn't that how we receive the Divine
[1:02:37] love of God we never merited it we never
[1:02:39] earned it and he loved us while we were
[1:02:42] yet sinners while we were undeserving
[1:02:44] when we were unlovable when we would
[1:02:46] have been hard to accept hard to receive
[1:02:48] he had a love for us and it was that
[1:02:50] love that broke us down
[1:02:53] that's the kind of love that can break
[1:02:54] people down when you look past the
[1:02:56] veneer when you look past the pretense
[1:02:58] when you can look past all their harms
[1:03:00] and all their hurts and all their
[1:03:01] difficulties and all their hardness and
[1:03:03] their rough exterior and you can be able
[1:03:05] to say I still love you
[1:03:07] and offer for forgiveness to someone
[1:03:09] even when it's hard to it could be the
[1:03:10] very thing that can break somebody down
[1:03:14] that's what Jesus did upon the cross
[1:03:17] when he cried out father forgive them
[1:03:19] for they know not what they do
[1:03:23] I think we mentioned it Sunday they
[1:03:24] there it was clear they were guilty it's
[1:03:27] clear that he was innocent
[1:03:29] and he didn't hang up on the cross
[1:03:30] rarling and ranting
[1:03:33] of the Injustice I'm innocent They
[1:03:36] Crucified it innocent man I shouldn't be
[1:03:38] here they're wrong you guys are all
[1:03:39] gonna you're wrong no father forgive
[1:03:41] them
[1:03:43] for they know not what they do
[1:03:45] our healing is connected with
[1:03:47] forgiveness
[1:03:49] and this is to me the Clincher I
[1:03:51] originally was going to read this at the
[1:03:52] very beginning on Sunday but it's say
[1:03:55] that for the very end tonight at
[1:03:56] Wednesday night brother ma'am says faith
[1:03:58] is based on forgiveness
[1:04:01] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:04:06] as we said this morning trying to get
[1:04:07] the church into a place to where we can
[1:04:09] really see Apostolic times moving among
[1:04:12] us remember faith is based on
[1:04:14] forgiveness that will all hunger
[1:04:17] and it's just laying right at the door
[1:04:19] we see it but we want to see more of it
[1:04:21] what Apostolic times
[1:04:24] we want it such a flow that will be a
[1:04:26] help to us and US flow out to others
[1:04:30] and that faith is based on forgiveness
[1:04:34] so that it can flow to help us
[1:04:36] and flow out to others
[1:04:39] we're going to have to have forgiveness
[1:04:41] whether we say I'm sorry
[1:04:43] or able to say Lord I forgive
[1:04:46] we're going to have to have it in the
[1:04:48] context of Christ My Healer in order for
[1:04:51] us to be healed
[1:04:53] I think it's very clear in the scripture
[1:04:55] we spent some time tonight to even show
[1:04:57] where science is recognizing the benefit
[1:05:00] of letting things go
[1:05:04] in no way am I trying to trivialize what
[1:05:06] you've been through
[1:05:07] I'm trying to lift up just how
[1:05:09] extraordinary and great forgiveness is
[1:05:12] and no matter how much we try to
[1:05:13] emphasize how great forgiveness is it's
[1:05:15] never in any way to trivialize what
[1:05:17] you've been through it's just to show
[1:05:19] that no matter what you've experienced
[1:05:20] forgiveness is greater
[1:05:23] forgiveness is more powerful
[1:05:26] than what's been done to you
[1:05:28] and we love you tonight thank you so
[1:05:30] much for being here God bless you
[1:05:32] musicians would come if we could stand
[1:05:34] together
