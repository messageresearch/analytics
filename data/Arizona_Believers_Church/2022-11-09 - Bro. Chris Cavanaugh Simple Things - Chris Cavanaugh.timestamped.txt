[0:04] so
[0:05] um
[0:06] before we get going this evening on my
[0:08] subject I just want to let you know that
[0:09] we're we're going to leave the the bonds
[0:12] of space tonight for another time so uh
[0:16] we won't be so much going over space
[0:18] again though we may come back to that at
[0:20] some point in the future uh but I felt
[0:23] that we needed to go a different
[0:25] direction or at least I I the lord gave
[0:28] me I feel like a a subject to to talk
[0:31] about and just a little bit different
[0:32] direction so instead of being out in
[0:34] space tonight we're going to come back
[0:35] to earth for a while and we're going to
[0:37] talk a little bit more about Earthly
[0:38] things instead of space driven things
[0:41] and so this evening the title that I'm
[0:46] going to be speaking on is simple things
[0:49] and I realized that if you see on my
[0:52] title slide it's not so simple and
[0:54] there's a reason for that uh and it's
[0:57] because a lot of times when we think of
[0:59] simple things
[1:00] uh we kind of get disappointed because
[1:03] most people we want something that's a
[1:05] little bit more than simple
[1:07] right if you get a wedding cake
[1:10] and somebody brings you a simple one
[1:13] and you're getting married
[1:15] it's not so great
[1:17] because you want the fancy cake right
[1:19] it's got to have the decorations it's
[1:21] got to be beautiful it has to be
[1:23] something compelling it has to write
[1:24] really catch people's attention
[1:26] and because you don't want to drop I
[1:28] don't know how much a wedding cake is
[1:29] 500 on a wedding cake that might just
[1:31] buy you a simple one I don't know I'm
[1:33] not sure how much they are my wedding
[1:35] cake was made by my sister-in-law so we
[1:37] didn't have to pay a whole lot for it so
[1:38] we were doing pretty good on that
[1:41] but
[1:42] the uh brother Brandon had talked about
[1:44] was simple things he he talked about how
[1:47] man likes to complicate things and man
[1:50] likes to to get down to where things are
[1:52] really difficult
[1:53] and and the churches like this is I I
[1:57] don't know if it's a church or a chapel
[1:58] but it certainly looked like a church to
[1:59] me and that's why I used the picture of
[2:01] it but you get a lot of dogmas in a
[2:03] church you get a lot of things and
[2:04] they'll do a lot of decorating of the
[2:05] church and then it looks great it's
[2:08] wonderful it's ornate it's not simple at
[2:10] all
[2:11] but yet what they're missing is the
[2:14] simple thing that needs to be in the
[2:15] church
[2:16] and so you know we bring them with us
[2:18] right the Lord comes with us hopefully
[2:20] he comes in our heart that's the that's
[2:22] the way it's supposed to be we're
[2:23] supposed to bring him along
[2:25] so but sometimes the simple things don't
[2:28] actually come out so simple but we're
[2:30] going to start off with a really simple
[2:31] thing this evening
[2:33] just to talk about
[2:35] just before we do I just want to let you
[2:37] know that I found out that uh I actually
[2:41] in a new youth group I didn't realize
[2:44] this until Friday night where we're at
[2:46] brother duffix and brother duffic had
[2:49] announced that his son had seen a bumper
[2:51] sticker and I was very excited to learn
[2:54] this because I I didn't realize that
[2:55] such a bumper exist bumper sticker
[2:57] existed
[2:58] but I found out that there's a brand new
[3:01] youth group brother Jeff you and me were
[3:03] in it it's called vintage youth
[3:06] so this evening for those of you that
[3:08] aren't in the regular youth group you
[3:11] can join the Vintage youth group so I
[3:13] kind of thought I would be in the
[3:14] classic youth group but I was told I was
[3:16] vintage so that's okay vintage is okay
[3:19] so this into this evening the the
[3:21] Vintage youth are going to be able to
[3:22] eat free
[3:24] that's and I don't think you can see it
[3:26] and I did that kind of on purpose that
[3:27] that says below with paying youth
[3:30] so what the youth are going to have to
[3:33] do is they're going to have to
[3:34] participate a little bit with me that's
[3:35] okay so I've Got Friends on the front
[3:37] row here so they'll be our participating
[3:40] Youth and that'll help pay for the
[3:41] Vintage youth that are getting to eat
[3:43] free this evening so that's our plan
[3:45] tonight
[3:46] so our our simple thing that we want to
[3:48] talk about
[3:50] um if you can go to the next slide
[3:51] Brothers there's a
[3:53] this is really simple
[3:55] and it says a malleable finite
[4:02] I can't even say it myself now
[4:04] slendraceous Coyle Rod of parallel axes
[4:07] with as Mutual terminates
[4:08] so nobody nobody has Google on right so
[4:11] no no no no no trying this is a really
[4:14] simple thing how many know what it is
[4:17] anybody
[4:19] kids
[4:23] but I'm pretty sure that almost
[4:24] everybody here knows what this is
[4:28] it's a very simple thing
[4:33] okay I was waiting for somebody to to
[4:36] like say oh I know what it is don't look
[4:38] it up Brothers
[4:39] no no no cheating on the back row
[4:41] because it'll kind of ruin things for us
[4:45] but this is a actually a statement that
[4:48] a person that I like that I work with
[4:50] likes to say often
[4:51] and the reason he likes to say it is
[4:54] because he feels it's impressive to say
[4:58] this particular phrase
[5:00] and he says it many times I guess he
[5:03] likes the way it rolls off his tongue to
[5:05] me it's kind of like I'm talking out of
[5:07] numbers right now and trying to get the
[5:09] names right because that's a tough one
[5:12] but anyway this is actually a simple
[5:14] thing and actually we're going to find
[5:16] out that you're going to know this I
[5:18] believe by the end of the service and
[5:21] part of the reason that I'm doing this
[5:23] is because I want you to understand that
[5:24] sometimes when we have simple things we
[5:27] can put it in such a way that people
[5:29] can't understand what we're talking
[5:31] about
[5:32] there's just no idea like I can repeat
[5:35] this phrase and you'll be like I have no
[5:36] idea you could repeat it a hundred times
[5:38] I have no idea what you're saying now I
[5:41] was raised Roman Catholic and I don't
[5:43] know about you all but I've been in
[5:44] services and I should say I've also been
[5:46] in services that weren't Roman Catholic
[5:48] where the minister gets up and he
[5:52] preaches and people come out of the
[5:55] service and they're all excited and
[5:57] everything is wonderful and they're like
[5:58] wow that was awesome and Emily like what
[6:00] did he say
[6:01] well I don't know but it was good it was
[6:04] it was it was Dynamic it was exciting
[6:06] yeah but what did it mean what did he
[6:09] say well it doesn't matter because it
[6:11] was so it was amazing like obviously we
[6:14] just have to wait until the Revelation
[6:15] comes and sometimes it just needs to be
[6:18] a simple thing and the Revelation can
[6:20] come that way because if you make it too
[6:22] difficult for people
[6:24] just like this statement if I make it
[6:26] too difficult yeah it's impressive right
[6:28] I've used some big words that's that's
[6:30] great but how does it actually help
[6:32] somebody how does it actually cause them
[6:34] to to know
[6:36] so in a little while I'm going to ask
[6:38] for some volunteers so if if volunteers
[6:40] are in the audience you guys be prepared
[6:42] to volunteer you don't have to
[6:44] but if you want the Vintage youth to eat
[6:46] free you've got to volunteer so
[6:49] so
[6:51] um
[6:51] turn with me to
[6:53] Romans the 11th chapter
[7:04] and it says this
[7:06] oh the depth of the riches both of the
[7:08] wisdom and knowledge of God how
[7:09] unsearchable are his judgment and his
[7:11] ways past finding out for who hath known
[7:13] the mind of the Lord are who hath been
[7:16] his counselor so the reason I'm going to
[7:19] read these things first before we get
[7:20] into the simple part of this message is
[7:22] because I want to balance this out
[7:24] because we understand there's a depth to
[7:25] God that goes beyond things that we
[7:27] could imagine so we understand this that
[7:30] we're going to have a whole eternity to
[7:32] get to know the Lord
[7:34] because there's no way that you're going
[7:35] to get to know them now a lot of people
[7:37] feel like they've they've got them down
[7:38] like I've figured out God I know exactly
[7:40] what he's doing I know how everything
[7:42] works but the reality is that's going to
[7:44] take an eternity to do
[7:45] because God has simplified himself for
[7:48] us because he's come down to to bring it
[7:51] to our level then we we start to think
[7:53] oh I got it figured out no I understand
[7:55] what what's going on here and the
[7:57] reality is it's going to take an
[7:59] eternity to do that turn to Psalms 19.
[8:07] I'll just read it from there it says
[8:09] Psalms 19 verse 1 and then six and seven
[8:12] it says the heavens declare the glory of
[8:13] God and the firmament showeth his
[8:15] handiwork his going forth is from the
[8:18] end of the heaven and his circuit under
[8:19] the ends of it and there is nothing hid
[8:21] from the heat thereof the law of the
[8:23] Lord is perfect it converts the soul the
[8:26] testimony of the Lord is sure it's
[8:28] making wise the simple so God is the one
[8:31] that makes us wise God is the one that
[8:33] brings wisdom to us he's the one that
[8:36] shows us these things and he's the one
[8:38] that brings these things forth to us and
[8:40] so I think it's just important to kind
[8:42] of get that out of the way first if if I
[8:46] talk about simple things and I preach in
[8:48] a simple way understand that I know that
[8:50] God is complicated
[8:51] but he's not complicated to us
[8:54] at least he shouldn't be
[8:56] because he's come down to reveal himself
[8:58] so as complicated as he is he's still
[9:01] going to reveal himself in a way that we
[9:03] can understand because what good does it
[9:06] do to bring someone to something where
[9:08] they can't understand what's going on it
[9:10] that doesn't help you to get there if
[9:12] you don't understand it so go ahead to
[9:14] the next one and what when he out to see
[9:18] it says this the Great Mighty Jehovah
[9:21] who thundered in Yonder who made the
[9:23] stars in the solar system so we didn't
[9:24] leave space altogether so
[9:27] who made the Earth out of things which
[9:28] does not appear spoken into existence
[9:30] but when he come to visit mankind he
[9:33] didn't write down on Golden chariots but
[9:35] he chose to come to a little Hillside
[9:37] stable and his burst was in a cattle
[9:39] manger simple things but from that
[9:42] manger came Emmanuel
[9:44] what's the greatest thing of all age and
[9:47] time ages and all time is the life and
[9:50] the spirit of a baby that was born in a
[9:52] manger in a stable on the side of a hill
[9:55] so here we have a God that's created the
[9:58] universe and you know how much I like to
[9:59] talk about the universe because I think
[10:00] it's pretty impressive
[10:02] when I go out at night I don't live in
[10:04] the the lights of Phoenix so I can
[10:06] actually see stars and and to me it's
[10:08] very impressive but yet the god that
[10:10] created all that the god that wrote the
[10:12] Bible the the god that that basically
[10:16] took all of creation and moved it
[10:18] through time and the god that in in Eden
[10:22] when things kind of went South and
[10:24] things got complicated he took it and
[10:26] and through the the pages of time has
[10:29] brought it to where today he's revealed
[10:31] himself and opened up a book to where
[10:33] we're going to come back to a
[10:34] relationship with him just like Eden
[10:37] that's what you're back to
[10:39] right the Holy Ghost brings us back into
[10:42] Fellowship like the fellowship they had
[10:44] in the Garden of Eden that's the whole
[10:46] purpose of it but yet the Lord You know
[10:49] here he is and he's created the whole
[10:51] universe and when he decides to show
[10:53] himself he comes to a young girl
[10:56] right actually the angel comes to a
[10:58] young girl and announces listen you're
[11:01] going to have a a child his name's going
[11:04] to be Jesus and he's going to you know
[11:07] save his people from their sins
[11:09] and you know Mary had an amazing ability
[11:12] you know what that was
[11:14] she had pondering ability
[11:17] now I know we have Ponder points in the
[11:19] church I think they're awesome
[11:20] personally because pondering something
[11:22] is actually a good thing because it
[11:24] means that the first time you hear it
[11:25] you don't have to throw it out you can
[11:27] actually think about this is this is
[11:29] this what God's leading me to do is this
[11:32] part of the word of God can I can I see
[11:34] where this where I would fit into this
[11:36] and so Mary takes upon herself
[11:39] that pondering Spirit to where she's
[11:42] like okay I'm not sure I completely
[11:44] understand this Lord but you know you've
[11:47] told me that this is a promise to me and
[11:48] this is going to happen and I'm just
[11:50] going to settle there I'm gonna I'm
[11:52] gonna I'm gonna let you work this out
[11:54] whatever it is I'm gonna let you work
[11:57] this out you're gonna be the one that's
[11:58] going to take care of everything I know
[12:00] that you've got it under under control
[12:02] everything's going to be all right
[12:04] because you're working it out now
[12:06] certainly she had problems because when
[12:09] this happens which it did
[12:11] because we know that it did right
[12:14] I hope so
[12:16] Christmas is coming up the whole world
[12:17] thinks that happened at Christmas time
[12:18] but we know you know when it really
[12:20] happened
[12:21] but it's happened and now Mary's having
[12:25] to deal with the reproach of those
[12:27] things because here she is not quite
[12:29] married yet she's spoused but hasn't had
[12:31] the ceremony yet and now she's pregnant
[12:34] right so it doesn't mean that simple
[12:37] things
[12:39] always make life simple for you
[12:42] right
[12:43] Promises of God don't always make life
[12:45] simple for you things that you that you
[12:47] deal with aren't always simple there's
[12:49] things that might come your way that may
[12:51] not be simple from just following a
[12:53] promise of God
[12:55] so that's where we're at with that
[12:59] so in the the
[13:01] sermon I am the resurrection in life
[13:05] brother Brown says God is not
[13:06] complicated people sometimes want to
[13:08] make him complicated but he God is known
[13:11] in Simplicity we look over the top of
[13:14] him trying to find him and he's so
[13:15] simple makes himself that way that's
[13:17] what makes him great
[13:19] and so just like in in the in the Garden
[13:22] of Eden now we could go back and and
[13:24] pain
[13:26] when he first started out he was that
[13:28] there was a a simple thing that happened
[13:31] his his brother Abel offers a better
[13:33] sacrifice right it's an accepted
[13:35] sacrifice
[13:36] and the interesting thing about Cain is
[13:38] when he's told listen if you just do
[13:40] well in other words do what your brother
[13:42] did I'm going to accept that there
[13:45] wasn't a whole lot of other there there
[13:47] wasn't a whole lot of other requirements
[13:48] put on him
[13:50] it was you just have to do well
[13:52] so just do what Abel did I'm going to
[13:55] accept it but just like people like to
[13:56] do they like to make things complicated
[13:58] you know we like to get I I think that
[14:01] Satan is the an expert at making things
[14:03] complex for people
[14:05] and I didn't put it into the slideshow
[14:11] but brother Brandon is talking about
[14:12] people and I'm not going to preach on
[14:14] complexes don't get me wrong but I just
[14:16] want to let you know so she's talking to
[14:18] a lady in the sermon contending for the
[14:20] faith
[14:21] and and the woman
[14:23] um comes up to for prayer and he says so
[14:26] I suppose we're strangers to each other
[14:28] not knowing each other and he says I see
[14:31] the woman now she moves from from me yes
[14:33] the woman is very much tore up about it
[14:35] and she had a nervous breakdown been
[14:36] very bad had a breakdown you're still
[14:39] suffering from it that's the truth isn't
[14:40] it and the sister says yes
[14:42] said you've had real funny feelings
[14:43] going through you all the time and
[14:45] especially real late of evening get real
[14:47] strange feeling isn't that right then I
[14:49] see you sitting down in a chair kind of
[14:51] late of an evening too you get tired you
[14:54] can't do your work and it isn't that
[14:55] right causes even stomach condition in
[14:58] you like that acids and things when you
[15:00] drink coffee or something another on
[15:02] that line you belch up acid or your
[15:04] stomach and so forth that's right I see
[15:06] you moving away from the table where
[15:07] there is stuff like that on by the
[15:09] window near window and I see a dark
[15:11] shadow of following you too which is a
[15:13] devil and he has almost tempted you to
[15:15] Suicide sometime telling you that you
[15:18] had crossed the separating line that you
[15:20] wasn't never going to be saved is that
[15:21] right so the woman has what we would
[15:24] call a complex what's happened there's
[15:27] layer upon layer of things that has
[15:28] happened with This Woman's life
[15:30] there's a situation that's happening it
[15:33] gets more complete complicated and more
[15:35] complex and so now she's gotten to be an
[15:37] older woman and she's like I don't I
[15:39] have all these problems I don't know why
[15:41] I have all these problems why is it
[15:43] built up that way and now if you have
[15:45] Psychiatry what they're going to do is
[15:46] kind of peel it like an onion because
[15:48] it's layer upon layer so they're going
[15:49] to start with the first layer they're
[15:50] going to work their way back and work
[15:52] their way back but God doesn't have to
[15:54] do it that way he can cut right through
[15:55] the onion get to the heart of the thing
[15:57] so he gets right to the heart of the
[15:59] matter so this whole trouble she's got
[16:02] stomach trouble she's she's so nervous
[16:03] she doesn't know what to do she's having
[16:05] problems sleeping she has you know
[16:07] physical problems she has mental issues
[16:08] she's thinking of of taking her own life
[16:11] she's got all these problems and it's
[16:13] very complex because Satan has built up
[16:16] those complexities over all that time
[16:19] and you know what the problem was
[16:21] when she was a child a dog chased her
[16:25] so brother Branham under the inspiration
[16:27] of the Lord takes her back to when
[16:28] you're a child and he's and he says that
[16:31] so here she has that dark shadow
[16:33] following her
[16:38] now the very thing that's here that
[16:39] knows your life I see it go way back to
[16:42] a little girl I see you as a little girl
[16:43] you were running from something it was
[16:46] something chasing you it was a dog it
[16:48] seemed like he was coming from school or
[16:50] something way long ago scared you and
[16:52] you've been nervous like all your life
[16:55] that's true isn't it
[16:57] that's true it was a simple thing
[17:00] that started off and made it complex
[17:02] through her life to where she didn't
[17:04] have any idea of what was going on like
[17:07] why is it why why do I have all these
[17:09] problems today why why can't I settle
[17:11] down why am I filled with anxiety why am
[17:13] I filled with all these things it was a
[17:15] simple thing that began it I've been
[17:17] chased by dogs it didn't have that
[17:20] effect on me so and a lot of people get
[17:23] chased by dogs maybe I'm gonna get bit
[17:24] by him I guess
[17:26] Philip's dad was the mailman did he ever
[17:27] get bit by a dog
[17:29] oh
[17:31] do you got bit by a dog see
[17:34] and you're doing okay
[17:35] right
[17:37] so you never know what simple thing can
[17:40] affect somebody because it could be at
[17:43] the age it could take you at an age when
[17:45] you just don't know how to cope with it
[17:46] and it builds up and builds up now again
[17:49] I'm not going down into complexes or
[17:51] whatever but I just want to say this is
[17:53] what Satan does is he wants to take
[17:55] simple things and complicate he wants to
[17:58] complicate your life and he'll use
[18:00] simple things to do it
[18:01] and then those simple things add more
[18:03] things on top of that and more things on
[18:05] top of that until you don't realize
[18:06] what's going on or where you're going
[18:08] with it or what's happening whatsoever
[18:13] I got to move faster because I'm not
[18:15] getting through this too quick
[18:18] so we left off with Mary
[18:23] and Sorry God is not complicated right
[18:24] people sometimes want to make him
[18:26] complicated so that's what I'm getting
[18:28] at is people want to make them
[18:29] complicated but God does some amazing
[18:32] things just simply so we can think back
[18:34] in the scripture with David so we've got
[18:37] a giant out there right and everybody's
[18:40] scared of the Giant and here's a little
[18:42] guy
[18:43] comes out
[18:45] not very big he was pretty scrawny
[18:46] brother random said but he had a nice
[18:49] Leather Pouch with some string leather
[18:53] string on it and he knew how to throw a
[18:55] rock
[18:56] and so he takes something simple to
[18:58] overcome his enemy
[19:00] so he's out there he's going to defeat
[19:02] his enemy he's got something simple in
[19:03] his hand all he has to do is take that
[19:05] rock throw it and it sounds pretty
[19:06] simple to me right hey that's pretty
[19:07] easy right I've got hey I've got a sling
[19:09] I can swing this thing and throw a rock
[19:11] but you have to realize there was a
[19:13] whole lot of things going on in that
[19:15] battle with Israel and everybody else is
[19:18] scared we got all kinds of armor hey
[19:19] David we're going to give you some armor
[19:21] we're going to put it on you he's like
[19:22] no that's too complicated for me I need
[19:24] something simple
[19:25] I need something plain and easy I need
[19:28] something that that's going to take care
[19:29] of this once and for all so we're going
[19:31] to do something really easy and David
[19:34] goes and he slays the giant right we
[19:35] know that story
[19:37] okay
[19:39] let's give you a hint on our our our
[19:41] definition that we gave earlier
[19:44] so this is this is something that you
[19:47] can use to open Secrets
[19:49] so if I write it down so you know no you
[19:51] don't have to write it down it's easy
[19:52] it's okay you don't have to write it
[19:53] down
[19:54] but that's your first clue about what is
[19:56] that slendraceous
[19:58] thing that we talked about earlier
[20:01] okay
[20:04] see I'm going to try and keep the kids
[20:06] interested in what we're doing because I
[20:07] want them to try and solve the puzzle if
[20:09] they can so we've got David out there
[20:11] with a sling and he's got something
[20:12] going on
[20:14] so we're going to talk just a little bit
[20:16] about Gideon so here's Gideon he's
[20:18] living in fear
[20:20] he's oppressed he's depressed he's
[20:23] hiding out by a wine press the meeting
[20:25] nights have taken over the land they're
[20:27] not letting them eat they got to go out
[20:28] and hide in order to produce their food
[20:31] they have to do something to make that
[20:32] food so he's out there
[20:34] crushing stuff and shaking it to get the
[20:36] chaff off so he can just get some some
[20:38] wheat to make some bread so that he can
[20:41] live and then God comes to him and says
[20:43] hey get in your Mighty Man of Valor I'm
[20:44] going to do something great with you and
[20:47] Gideon goes through a whole lot of
[20:49] turmoil because again getting is kind of
[20:51] like us sometimes we're oppressed
[20:53] sometimes we're depressed you know he
[20:55] talks about his family he's like look at
[20:57] him my family's nobody we're poor so
[20:59] he's got a lot of self-pity he's dealing
[21:01] with
[21:02] you know everything's bad nothing's good
[21:05] right now and so God starts to work
[21:07] through that and he allows him to to put
[21:09] some what they call fleeces out and he
[21:10] said hey if there's doing it and I
[21:12] squeeze it you know nothing's on the
[21:14] ground great and if there's you know
[21:16] stuff on the ground but nothing on the
[21:17] do hey I know you're there and
[21:18] eventually the Lord just works through
[21:20] all that that complex that Gideon's got
[21:22] to get down to the simple thing that he
[21:24] had inside him from the very beginning
[21:26] because in God's mind he was always a
[21:29] man of Valor
[21:30] he just didn't see himself that way then
[21:33] but in there he simply was a man of
[21:36] Valor and all that had to be happening
[21:38] was those layers of problems and the
[21:40] complications had to be pulled away and
[21:43] drawn back and it had to be fixed that
[21:45] way
[21:46] and so Gideon comes up and brother if
[21:48] you can go to the next slide
[21:51] and here's an army and they're waiting
[21:53] for him
[21:54] and that Army's sitting there and
[21:57] they're ready to get him and the Army is
[21:58] is a big army it's well funded it's got
[22:02] really good weapons it's got really good
[22:03] protection and not only that it's got
[22:06] the whole government behind it because
[22:07] they are the government
[22:09] and the the Lord says we're going to
[22:11] deliver these men into your hands
[22:14] and so he he's going to get everything
[22:16] together and make sure that um we have
[22:20] Warriors to fight
[22:21] so they got about 32 000 guys it starts
[22:23] out with it's a big it's a big group not
[22:27] as big as they wanted but pretty big
[22:28] group then God says this is too many
[22:31] right got to get it down I need it a
[22:34] little bit simpler so I said hey anybody
[22:36] that's afraid go home
[22:38] right if if you're afraid go home so a
[22:41] bunch of them go
[22:43] so then it's like okay this is still too
[22:45] many we got to get it down
[22:47] so then they go to drink out of the
[22:48] water right and the ones that that you
[22:51] know keep their eyes up and drink like a
[22:53] dog he said okay count those out 300
[22:55] guys okay now bear in mind here's an
[22:57] army and I'm just giving pictures we
[23:00] could imagine these things but since we
[23:02] actually use this I'm trying to use
[23:03] pictures because usually I Don't Preach
[23:05] with pictures
[23:06] but now we've got an army and now we've
[23:08] got 300 people and so it's it's going to
[23:11] get very exciting now because we're
[23:12] going to go and fight with 300 people
[23:14] how are we going to do it
[23:15] so if you can go to the next slide
[23:20] this is what they get
[23:23] Gideon you and your 300 men you're going
[23:26] to get a pot a water pot without water
[23:28] in it you're going to get a lamp and
[23:30] you're going to get a trumpet or a horn
[23:32] this is how you're going to defeat it
[23:35] simple things
[23:37] right
[23:39] it was just simple things
[23:42] now boys if you're going to battle
[23:44] you think you want to go with that
[23:47] they got swords and Spears brother Chris
[23:50] he's going to give you a pot and a lamp
[23:53] and a horn what do you say let's go
[23:56] not really
[23:58] no
[23:59] but you realize it's simple things
[24:02] it was just simple things but what was
[24:04] important was the one that was
[24:06] controlling the simple things
[24:09] so who was behind it was the one that
[24:12] mattered the number of people there and
[24:15] the thing that they were fighting with
[24:17] it wasn't the important thing it was
[24:19] what was operating that thing what was
[24:22] in in there for them
[24:24] and again simple things were there
[24:27] simple things were present and so they
[24:29] go out with they've got this pot they
[24:30] got the lamp in the pot and they've got
[24:32] their horn and when Gideon gives a sign
[24:35] they break the pot they've got their
[24:36] lamp now that this whole tribe so they
[24:38] broke up in three groups 100 on each
[24:41] side kind of in a triangle shape I guess
[24:42] you'd say or maybe in a circle but 100
[24:44] per group
[24:45] and then they blow the horns
[24:48] and then they start to shout
[24:50] and all that did was cause the enemy to
[24:53] be confounded
[24:55] and it caused them to start killing
[24:57] themselves
[24:58] because they were using simple things
[25:00] that Lord told them to use
[25:03] just simple things that the Lord told
[25:04] them to use
[25:06] there's one day in a battle there's a
[25:08] man called Samson
[25:10] and Samson had a tendency to get in
[25:13] trouble especially with the people that
[25:15] he hung out with
[25:16] not just with his enemies but with his
[25:19] brothers
[25:20] because he just kind of liked to stir
[25:22] trouble he was just the kind of guy that
[25:25] did those things and so one day Samson
[25:27] is is doing something and and people get
[25:30] mad at him for doing it and they're
[25:31] saying Samson you can't do that and the
[25:33] the the Philistines are going to come
[25:35] and destroy us
[25:36] you got to do something you got to fix
[25:38] this problem Samson we we need to to you
[25:42] know get away from these Philistine
[25:43] people they're going to hurt us and you
[25:45] know you've got strength but we don't
[25:46] have this so
[25:48] um we want to tie you up and deliver you
[25:49] into their hands and so he makes some
[25:51] promise you won't do anything to me
[25:52] because you're my brothers I don't want
[25:54] you to hurt me but just promise and so
[25:56] they they tie them up with chords and
[25:58] deliver them to his enemy
[26:00] and again here's Samson and so I want
[26:02] you to kind of boys you can imagine this
[26:04] or girls girls probably don't like
[26:05] battles so much I don't know
[26:07] so maybe some girls like to do girls
[26:09] like to fight
[26:10] no good okay sometimes people like that
[26:13] I don't know you never know like fight
[26:15] with your sisters who knows I'm not sure
[26:17] but here's here's here's um Samson and
[26:22] you can just kind of Imagine That
[26:24] Samson's taken up he's placed up on a
[26:26] hill with Philistines all around him and
[26:29] what he begins to do is to to once they
[26:32] he realizes that you know the the his
[26:34] friends have backed away and he's left
[26:36] alone then he just breaks those chords
[26:38] and he grabs something
[26:41] he reaches down and he grabs and so just
[26:44] imagine there's two guys there and
[26:45] they're watching the watching the scene
[26:47] happen and they're and the one says to
[26:49] the other hey you know he's got a spy
[26:51] glass and he's like hey what's he doing
[26:52] and he's like well it looks like he's
[26:54] going to fight him and he's like fight
[26:55] him how's he fighting him well he's got
[26:57] buddy and he's like buddy what do you
[26:59] mean buddy you know buddy the borough
[27:01] he's like buddy the Burrow's dead I'm
[27:04] like yeah nobody the borough is dead but
[27:05] he's got his Jawbone in his hand and
[27:08] he's ready to take him on could you go
[27:09] to the next slide brother
[27:10] so here he is he's ready to take on
[27:13] buddy the borough take him on with Buddy
[27:16] of the borough
[27:17] so you can imagine he's surrounded
[27:19] by a whole Army a thousand people and he
[27:22] starts whacking them so the brothers
[27:24] looking like wow that is buddy it's
[27:26] Buddy the burrow he's got buddy the
[27:28] donkey right burrow donkey got it okay
[27:31] we know a buddy the burrow so that's why
[27:33] I'm using buddy the borough because he's
[27:34] a great donkey so
[27:37] but all he's swinging is a a Jawbone and
[27:41] the scripture teaches us that there was
[27:43] a thousand people
[27:45] armed dangerous
[27:48] right
[27:49] but just with a Jawbone defeats that
[27:52] enemy
[27:53] and then
[27:55] as he he gets to the end of this battle
[27:57] and they're watching the battle he's
[27:58] looking through and he's like wow that's
[28:00] amazing he's like buddy is I can't
[28:02] believe Buddy's Jawbone is that strong
[28:04] like how is it holding up to all of this
[28:06] and then after the enemy is is defeated
[28:09] they're looking through this thing and
[28:11] what do they see is like oh man Samson
[28:13] he's wiped out he's I don't think he's
[28:15] going to be able to go on like he looks
[28:18] like he's ready to fall down
[28:20] and then as they look through what do
[28:22] they see they see him take that Jawbone
[28:24] and open it and drink from it
[28:27] so not only does he have the thing to
[28:30] defeat his enemy but he has the thing to
[28:32] gain strength again before the enemy can
[28:34] come another time
[28:36] and that Saints is what God does for us
[28:39] you defeat your enemy with the word of
[28:41] God you defeat your enemy through those
[28:43] things and while you have to because
[28:46] look at sometimes when you go through a
[28:48] trial or a test you need time let's face
[28:50] it to recuperate
[28:51] right you need time to get your strength
[28:53] back and the water of the word does that
[28:56] so the same thing that defeats your
[28:58] enemy is the same thing that gives you
[29:00] the strength to be prepared for the next
[29:02] time the enemy comes because he's not
[29:04] going to give up while you're here
[29:06] they're going to keep trying and keep
[29:07] trying until they get to you and that's
[29:09] their job right
[29:11] what's Satan here for he's trying he's
[29:13] he's trying to defeat God's people any
[29:16] way that he can
[29:18] but the same thing that that will save
[29:20] you is the same thing that will will
[29:22] strengthen you for the next time the
[29:24] same thing that will deliver you from an
[29:25] enemy is the same thing that's going to
[29:27] provide you everything that you need the
[29:28] next time the enemy comes
[29:30] and you'll gain that strength each time
[29:33] that it's necessary through simple
[29:35] things
[29:36] it's just simple things that gets us
[29:37] there
[29:50] so let's go to the next slide
[29:54] God takes simple things
[29:56] it doesn't take great things it takes
[29:58] simple things used right
[30:01] it ain't altogether simple things but
[30:03] it's got to be used right
[30:05] every man lived in the wilderness wasn't
[30:07] to John every man carried a slingshot
[30:09] wasn't David every man picked up a job
[30:11] and of a mule wasn't a Samson but when
[30:13] it's used in the Anointed Hands of
[30:15] servant of God
[30:17] and remember we talked about the Lord
[30:18] earlier when he was a baby there was a
[30:20] lot of children who's been born in
[30:21] Stables a lot of children may have been
[30:23] born in mangers
[30:25] but it's the way or what you do with it
[30:28] so that's the kind of the thought that I
[30:30] want you to have in the back of your
[30:31] mind it's simple things but it's what's
[30:34] it Anointed with
[30:36] how is it happening or how is it working
[30:39] that way
[30:40] so that's the important part of it that
[30:42] I want you to get to is that's what is
[30:44] is working on for you
[30:45] is those things
[30:50] in Ephesians 6 the 11 6 chapter 11 and
[30:54] 12 it says put on the whole armor of God
[30:55] that you may be able to stand
[30:58] Against The Wiles of the devil for we
[31:01] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[31:03] against principalities against powers
[31:04] and against us uh against the rulers of
[31:08] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[31:10] wickedness in high places
[31:12] so
[31:14] what we're doing is actually using
[31:16] something that
[31:18] the the Lord provides for us
[31:21] and the thing is is that we're not
[31:24] wrestling against flesh and blood but
[31:25] what we are using is simple things that
[31:28] the Lord provides
[31:30] so
[31:31] if you have hope
[31:34] and now I'm not talking about like I
[31:36] hope I win the lottery because it's 1.2
[31:37] billion dollars
[31:39] because that's just a Wishful thought
[31:41] but hope that's based on something
[31:44] so what does Hope allow you to overcome
[31:48] discouragement
[31:50] right
[31:52] because if I hope in something if I you
[31:54] know someday that you these young men
[31:57] and women up here will eventually be
[31:59] like well I hope I find a boy that likes
[32:02] me or I hope I find a girl that likes me
[32:04] right because but that's not the kind of
[32:06] hope that we're talking about what it is
[32:09] is when somebody actually shows an
[32:11] interest in it and then you hope that
[32:13] you get the courage to talk to him
[32:15] because now you you know there's
[32:17] something on the other end working in
[32:18] your favor you just got to get there
[32:21] and when we have things like we so if we
[32:25] have joy
[32:26] Joy allows us to overcome sorrow
[32:28] it allows us to defeat that enemy it
[32:30] allows us to overcome depression if we
[32:33] have peace in our heart it allows us to
[32:36] overcome anxiety so God uses these
[32:39] things to simple things right but
[32:42] they're from his word and they're
[32:43] empowered by the Holy Ghost you know
[32:46] there's a lot of people let's put it
[32:47] this way there's a lot of people that
[32:48] have joy
[32:49] right there's a lot of people that that
[32:52] have peace but there's not a lot of
[32:55] people that have peace that passes all
[32:56] understanding because you're not going
[32:58] to get it without the spirit of God
[33:00] it can't happen you can have a level of
[33:03] Peace you can have a level of Joy right
[33:06] but there's nothing like the joy of your
[33:08] salvation
[33:09] because you realize that that joy that a
[33:12] lot of people have it's going to come to
[33:14] an end at the end of their life and so
[33:15] they know they've only got a limited
[33:16] time but for you when you have a joy of
[33:18] your salvation you know like look at
[33:20] when I get to the end of the road here I
[33:22] know I'm going Beyond this to something
[33:24] better than this so I've got joy right
[33:26] now but I've got Greater Joy coming so I
[33:29] can have joy like nobody else can have
[33:31] joy I can have peace like nobody else
[33:33] can have peace I can have hope like
[33:34] nobody else can have hope and it's
[33:36] because it's under an anointing and it's
[33:38] under a promise of God it's something
[33:40] that God is doing through you or God is
[33:42] able to work through and then that way
[33:44] when you have something come up there's
[33:46] a stressor in your life and anxiety
[33:48] comes upon you you can look back and say
[33:50] I've got the joy of my salvation
[33:52] I've got a piece that passes all
[33:54] understanding and if it's not present
[33:57] there you've got a prayer that you can
[33:59] put before the Lord and that will come
[34:01] to you it'll change you it'll change
[34:04] your destination it'll change your
[34:06] environment and it'll keep those
[34:07] complexes from building up on you
[34:10] it won't let you wallow in self-pity
[34:13] you know we have there's a lot of people
[34:15] that have love
[34:16] would you agree I think that in fact
[34:19] they talk about it all the time all you
[34:20] need is love right
[34:23] that's all you need just need love
[34:25] but everybody in the human race for the
[34:28] most part at some point has love for
[34:30] something whether it's animals people
[34:32] whatever their job a car like some
[34:35] people really love cars they have love
[34:37] for something
[34:39] but that kind of love also is unable to
[34:43] do things like the love that the Lord
[34:45] gives you can
[34:46] because he's got a kind of love that
[34:48] goes to where you know if you have love
[34:50] and you love your friends
[34:52] most people can do that if you can love
[34:54] the people that you hang out with and
[34:56] you know you get along with and
[34:57] everybody's happy with most people can
[34:59] do that
[35:00] but it takes a special kind of love to
[35:02] love your enemies and that love is the
[35:05] only thing that can come from the Lord
[35:07] he's the one that has to bring that to
[35:08] you
[35:15] in First Peter 4 8.
[35:18] says above all things
[35:21] have fervent charity among yourselves
[35:23] for a charity shall cover the multitude
[35:26] of sins
[35:28] and I think that that's the greatest
[35:30] thing that we can have is love simply
[35:32] because it can make up for a lack of a
[35:35] lot of things
[35:36] if you have a fervent love one for
[35:38] another it can make up for the fact that
[35:40] maybe you're not so joyful around the
[35:42] person
[35:44] it can make up for the fact that maybe
[35:46] sometimes you're not as as resting like
[35:49] you're you're a little bit anxious
[35:50] sometimes around them but if you have
[35:52] real love for them it'll help you get to
[35:54] having peace around people that you just
[35:56] can't quite get along with or just can't
[35:58] quite deal with or just can't quite you
[36:01] know figure out
[36:02] it'll help you in that way
[36:10] okay I wanna
[36:12] and switch just a little bit here and I
[36:14] want to give some
[36:17] now before I give a testimony
[36:20] I need to volunteer
[36:25] okay
[36:28] so we were talking earlier and I'm going
[36:29] to try and say this without stumbling
[36:31] through it this time a malleable finite
[36:33] cylinderacious coil Rod of parallel axis
[36:35] with azimuthal terminates
[36:38] so you're going to get come on now
[36:41] I don't want you to say anything okay
[36:50] that's it
[36:52] you know what it is
[36:54] I'll take your seat for a minute
[37:01] do you think everybody else will know
[37:04] maybe okay
[37:07] don't write it down don't say anything
[37:08] yet
[37:10] so I want to give a little testimony or
[37:12] by way of a testimony
[37:16] um in the 1970s
[37:20] my wife's family was living in Tucson
[37:23] Arizona
[37:25] and
[37:26] the they were part of the Tucson
[37:29] Tabernacle group
[37:30] uh they I don't know how they met I
[37:33] don't recall but anyway they're part of
[37:34] the Tucson Tabernacle group and there
[37:36] was a large part of that group that
[37:37] decided that they should move to Israel
[37:40] so in the early part of the 1970s they
[37:42] head to Israel
[37:44] and they get to Israel and actually they
[37:48] didn't go to Israel first they went into
[37:49] Belgium I believe and then eventually
[37:51] end up in Israel and so they're in
[37:53] Israel for a while
[37:55] during that time their djokovic's dad
[37:59] has odd jobs that he's doing different
[38:02] things that he's working on but he
[38:03] eventually gets a job as a chauffeur
[38:05] and I'm not going to use names because
[38:08] simply this goes out on the internet so
[38:10] I'll try to avoid names but just kind of
[38:12] give place to things
[38:15] so anyways he gets this job with the
[38:17] chauffeur the the lady is a fairly
[38:20] important person in Israel she's
[38:22] actually running a Hebrew language
[38:23] school
[38:25] and he works for her for a while they
[38:28] have tests and trials whether in Israel
[38:30] just like everybody has like we have in
[38:32] Arizona it's not much different it's
[38:34] kind of desert they have tests and
[38:35] trials over there we got tests and
[38:36] trials here you got things that happen
[38:38] but just through the course of Life
[38:40] they're there for a few years and then
[38:42] they move back to Tucson
[38:44] well uh while they're overseas their
[38:49] oldest daughter really falls in love
[38:51] with the country she's old enough at
[38:53] that time to kind of build a
[38:54] relationship with people she just likes
[38:57] Israel itself and eventually when she
[38:59] becomes a teenager she moves back there
[39:02] so the families come back to Tucson at
[39:04] this time and then eventually they go to
[39:05] Nebraska well Iowa and then Nebraska and
[39:08] then Minnesota and then I believe it's
[39:10] from Minnesota right that she ends up
[39:12] moving to Israel
[39:15] so she goes back over there and and um
[39:17] during that time uh
[39:20] um Djokovic and I would have gotten
[39:22] married
[39:23] I'm sorry I'm using your name and it's
[39:24] going on the internet
[39:27] I guess that's okay I can use her name
[39:30] um we had gotten married and right
[39:32] around that time her sister that's just
[39:34] a little bit younger than her uh decides
[39:37] to move to Israel as well and so she
[39:39] gets over to Israel
[39:42] um and she begins to work for this lady
[39:44] that runs this Hebrew language school
[39:46] because her sister that it went prior to
[39:49] her had become her assistant and so she
[39:52] gets a job with the same person
[39:54] and in the course of time and I'm sorry
[39:55] I'm trying to make this really
[39:56] abbreviated but in the course of time uh
[40:00] there's a a young man that comes from
[40:01] England
[40:02] and uh he had a girlfriend at the time
[40:05] but he shows up in this uh at the Hebrew
[40:07] language school and
[40:08] um happens to meet their sister and when
[40:12] they meet they end up falling in love
[40:14] they end up getting married and after
[40:17] they get married
[40:18] um they're in England and living in
[40:21] England and so in
[40:22] um
[40:24] 93. in 1993 I have it in my notes but in
[40:28] 1993 they end up going to
[40:31] uh sorry they end up being married in
[40:33] England and um at that time again Jacob
[40:36] and I were married in 1989 but in in
[40:38] 1993 we go to the wedding in England and
[40:42] uh the man that she marries is very
[40:44] British
[40:45] so much so that he goes out of his way
[40:47] to tell us how Great Britain is and how
[40:50] terrible America is and that uh you know
[40:53] basically uh the last thing that he
[40:56] would ever do is move to America
[40:58] and we're like okay okay you know he's
[41:00] gonna I'm gonna raise my kids in an
[41:02] English you know very uh uh proper
[41:05] school it's going to be just an amazing
[41:07] place
[41:09] um it's going to be you know a proper
[41:11] English education
[41:13] um and there's a lot of conversation
[41:15] that goes on at this time but he makes
[41:17] it very clear he's never coming to
[41:19] America so okay you're never coming to
[41:21] America got it
[41:22] and a few years later
[41:26] um actually he uh
[41:28] is about October of 96 so this is 93
[41:31] when they're married in in 96 uh he
[41:35] can't find a job
[41:36] so guess who calls somebody from America
[41:39] says hey you want to come to America and
[41:41] work
[41:42] hey why not you know go to America so he
[41:45] moves to America
[41:46] and um in the summer of uh
[41:51] 99 I guess it would be
[41:55] um they have their
[41:58] is it their first child or second
[42:01] second child okay so the first child was
[42:03] born in England second child is born in
[42:07] um and or is going to be born actually
[42:09] in Ohio so they're and they end up in in
[42:12] Cincinnati Ohio
[42:14] so I'm going to leave off that story for
[42:15] just a little little bit but anyway in
[42:18] the 70s the parents go to Israel
[42:21] um eventually in the 80s some of the
[42:24] kids follow in the 90s now that they've
[42:27] gotten married and come to America even
[42:29] though they would never be here uh and
[42:31] you know the story moves on so go back
[42:34] to to um Djokovic and I so we got
[42:36] married in 89 and we had our first child
[42:40] in 94.
[42:41] everything was fine no problems at all
[42:43] and June of 97 we had our second child
[42:47] and the second child everything seemed
[42:49] great he looked extremely healthy but
[42:51] within 24 hours he had to have emergency
[42:53] surgery
[42:54] and the emergency surgery was was
[42:57] because he had a blockage in his
[42:59] intestines and he had what's called
[43:01] short gut syndrome or jejuna letresia
[43:03] short gut syndrome is the easier simpler
[43:05] way to talk about it but basically what
[43:07] he had was about 70 of a small intestine
[43:09] was missing there would have been
[43:11] something that happened when he was
[43:12] developing that wasn't there
[43:15] um he had all these issues and problems
[43:19] and
[43:20] um during this time by the way the folks
[43:22] that had been in Cincinnati eventually
[43:23] moved to Albuquerque New Mexico and the
[43:27] the brother that um married her sister
[43:30] ends up getting the Holy Ghost in
[43:32] Albuquerque at least that's what he
[43:34] reported to us
[43:35] and
[43:37] anyway so Caleb has this emergency sorry
[43:40] I didn't mean to use a name but
[43:42] um our son has an emergency surgery
[43:44] within 24 hours
[43:46] uh they end up having to leave a section
[43:49] of his intestine he's lost so much of it
[43:51] that they're figuring that he's not
[43:52] going to be able to survive without as
[43:55] much as they could possibly leave
[43:57] and so
[43:58] um they they leave a section that's
[44:00] really distended or in other words
[44:01] spread out it's made really big it
[44:04] shouldn't even be there because at that
[44:05] time it should only be about as big as a
[44:07] pencil so your intestine is a baby but
[44:10] it's really stretched out
[44:13] um
[44:14] he has to get fed through IVs so we're
[44:19] having to do like this kind of yellow
[44:20] liquid stuff that's vitamins and
[44:22] minerals and stuff pumped into them
[44:24] through what's the central line in the
[44:25] central line just so you know it goes
[44:27] right to the heart so it has to get to
[44:29] the first chamber because it's too hard
[44:31] on on the vascular system it ruins it so
[44:33] it has to get there right away
[44:36] and
[44:37] um he's got this eventually he gets
[44:39] something into his tummy called a G-tube
[44:42] to get other well he gets a thing first
[44:44] down his nose to go into his stomach he
[44:46] doesn't really tolerate Foods well it's
[44:48] years of care eventually we went I'm
[44:51] going to try and shorten this a bit we
[44:53] end up in the Make-A-Wish Foundation
[44:55] um and if you don't know what that is
[44:57] it's basically for chronic and
[44:59] eventually terminal children or people
[45:02] in the Make-A-Wish Foundation so he ends
[45:05] up into that particular thing
[45:08] uh jock Vince since I've already used
[45:09] your name I'll keep using it Djokovic
[45:11] becomes a nurse because there's
[45:13] nursing things that have to be done you
[45:15] have to change bandages on these Central
[45:17] lines we become frequent flyers to the
[45:19] hospital because every time he gets a
[45:21] fever we've got to go so if it's over
[45:23] 100 you get a trip to the hospital so
[45:25] the hospital's got to know us really
[45:26] well we were there a lot because kids if
[45:30] they teeth well they'd say they don't
[45:31] but if they tee they get fevers if if
[45:33] you blink at them they get fevers if
[45:35] somebody has a cold they get a fever I
[45:37] mean we went all the time and there are
[45:40] several of you here that know this whole
[45:41] story so
[45:43] um but anyway we're in this Make-A-Wish
[45:44] Foundation
[45:45] and it's a lot of work like we have to
[45:49] carry a pack it's and he's Tethered to
[45:51] this pack with a line that goes to his
[45:52] stomach because we're feeding him that
[45:54] way and it's also a big trial because
[45:56] when you go into a store this was before
[45:58] the days where leashes were popular
[46:00] and it was people would always whisper
[46:04] just at the level where you could hear
[46:05] them because that's what people do and
[46:07] they'd be like how horrible that you
[46:09] would lease your child and how could you
[46:10] treat your child that way little do they
[46:12] know that this is the only way that the
[46:13] child gets fed is if you don't if you
[46:16] don't do this and it's basically running
[46:17] 24 hours a day because he he absorbs so
[46:20] little food that he's not able to to do
[46:23] anything
[46:24] so it just it has to keep feeding him
[46:27] and he's got this central line and um
[46:31] um and he'd had him in multiple places
[46:33] on his body on his head on his neck on
[46:35] his chest wherever they could access to
[46:37] because if it got pulled out or if um if
[46:41] something happened and they felt like
[46:42] there was a problem they would take it
[46:44] out mostly it got pulled out you know
[46:46] little kids would grab it or you know
[46:49] sometimes they would get hooked on
[46:50] something so it was a big to do
[46:53] uh anyways
[46:55] and by the way I
[46:57] I don't think I mentioned this but I
[46:59] think it was brother Aaron when he was
[47:01] if it was this Sunday but when he was
[47:03] saying that you know sometimes you need
[47:05] to to tell people what God did for you
[47:08] right was that Charles Spurgeon quote
[47:10] was that that right so this is me
[47:12] telling you what God did for us
[47:14] okay and and when he said that in fact
[47:17] my whole sermon wasn't even going to be
[47:18] this I was going a completely other
[47:20] direction and then I I kind of got
[47:23] turned and then a couple days later he's
[47:24] like hey you know here's what we should
[47:27] do you should tell people what God did
[47:29] for you I'm like okay well I guess we're
[47:30] going this direction
[47:32] so anyways um
[47:35] after years of dealing with this and and
[47:38] there's a lot of problems that are our
[47:40] particular doctor was not a very uh the
[47:43] main primary physician was not a very
[47:45] encouraging person
[47:47] um and fought us on every turn every
[47:50] time we tried to do something he would
[47:51] be against it it was just a constant
[47:53] battle but we actually ended up with a
[47:56] pediatrician from Israel
[47:58] and so Jacques that had been there they
[48:01] had a connection so the Lord put this
[48:04] man into our path this pediatrician and
[48:06] he would actually fight for us so he
[48:09] would have the main physician fighting
[48:10] against us and the pediatrician fighting
[48:13] for us
[48:14] and
[48:16] so jock that carries around all these
[48:18] bags she's got all these things to do
[48:19] and by the way has also his kidneys had
[48:21] a problem too where they had what's
[48:22] called reflux so he had two kidneys but
[48:25] basically one was really tiny and the
[48:27] other was about a third smaller than it
[48:29] should have been so between the two he
[48:31] had the function of one kidney
[48:33] and he had reflux so he's got a lot of
[48:35] issues again he's in in the Make-A-Wish
[48:37] Foundation you know the Doctor Who I
[48:40] said is discouraging he's like hey you
[48:42] know
[48:43] um if he doesn't you know come through
[48:45] this particular stage of life or
[48:46] whatever there's not much hope for him
[48:48] there's really no hope there's nothing
[48:50] you can do and so we're asking is there
[48:52] any surgeries is there anything that can
[48:53] be done and of course everybody's
[48:54] praying like I won't mention names but
[48:57] people in this particular congregation
[48:58] are praying
[48:59] as well as we are so everybody's praying
[49:03] and uh her sister that had married the
[49:06] the man from England calls and says hey
[49:08] I'm going to have a baby will you come
[49:10] to Cincinnati Ohio
[49:12] well guess what brother Chris doesn't
[49:14] want his wife to do
[49:15] go to Cincinnati Ohio because it's it to
[49:19] take all the equipment necessary to care
[49:21] for this child and go to Cincinnati is
[49:24] really an undertaking
[49:26] but Djokovic was persistent and said she
[49:30] could do it and I believed her and so
[49:31] she went to Cincinnati Ohio
[49:33] and in Cincinnati
[49:35] was just like clockwork
[49:38] um Caleb Gets an infection
[49:40] and that means this trip straight to the
[49:42] hospital
[49:43] so in this infection
[49:45] when he gets to the hospital and he has
[49:48] this infection there's a surgical nurse
[49:51] that has taken an extra shift in the ER
[49:52] that evening
[49:54] and so Djokovic starts to explain what's
[49:56] going on and when she learns that he had
[49:58] a shortcut and she says have you ever
[50:00] considered doing the Bianchi procedure
[50:02] well we don't know Bianchi from a hole
[50:04] in the ground we don't know what Bianchi
[50:05] is because our physician has said
[50:08] there's nothing that can be done
[50:10] and it turns out that there's a surgery
[50:12] that could be done to where they can
[50:14] take a distended part of small intestine
[50:16] squeeze it basically split it in half
[50:19] for lack of a better term and make it
[50:21] longer
[50:22] so it took about a year and a half
[50:26] year to a year and a half of arguing
[50:28] with our doctor to let us go to do this
[50:31] surgery and in fact we boarded the plane
[50:32] just to kind of condense the story We
[50:34] boarded a plane without insurance and we
[50:36] told them we're going and the gentleman
[50:38] from Israel The Physician from Israel
[50:40] fought the whole time
[50:42] for this
[50:43] and he went through the whole procedure
[50:46] and uh sorry he went through the whole
[50:48] thing of the one physician arguing no
[50:50] I'm not going to sign this document
[50:51] because we had to have the primary
[50:53] physician sign to cover it so we boarded
[50:55] a plane got us in your hands we're going
[50:58] because this can help him and that that
[51:00] same doctor kept telling us well what if
[51:02] it what if it it makes him worse what if
[51:04] it kills them and it's like you've
[51:05] already told us you know he's going to
[51:08] die you've already said this is a
[51:10] problem so this is the way it's going to
[51:12] be so we board a plane and by the time
[51:13] we land the Lord had worked it out he'd
[51:15] signed that document and we had the
[51:17] surgery and when the surgeon comes out
[51:19] he says you know I really believe that
[51:20] that someone was in there with us
[51:22] because that distended area that they
[51:25] saved was just perfect he said we didn't
[51:27] have to do anything all we had to do was
[51:28] take and divide that section it was
[51:30] already there it was like it was just
[51:32] made for us and he said I felt like
[51:34] somebody was in the room with us
[51:37] and it worked it out
[51:39] and
[51:41] so we come back and my son had had not
[51:45] had any while we always worried about a
[51:47] central line infection he never had one
[51:51] until after the surgery
[51:53] and then it was sometime after the
[51:55] surgery that he had a central line
[51:56] infection for the first time so that
[51:57] time we went to the hospital they test
[51:59] them and it can be fatal by the way in
[52:00] just about 24 hours it's it because it's
[52:02] going right to your heart so it's right
[52:04] there so you get an infection in your
[52:06] heart it's really dangerous so anyway
[52:07] they pull out the central line and they
[52:09] put in a PICC line
[52:11] and jock bed says you know we don't want
[52:13] a central line to go back in
[52:15] because we're just believing that the
[52:17] Lord was in this whole thing so anyway
[52:19] to kind of condense this
[52:23] um
[52:24] within uh
[52:27] two years
[52:29] the surgery is a year it was a year it
[52:31] was a year within a year of the surgery
[52:33] he no longer has the central line
[52:36] uh he eventually gets off the tube
[52:39] that's feeding him that's in his belly
[52:42] um and then
[52:43] um when he's about six years old no
[52:47] before he was six sorry they said that
[52:49] the kidney problem so he has this reflux
[52:50] still and that's still going on and he's
[52:52] in church one night
[52:54] and the lord gave him a revelation
[52:56] because he came to his mom and said my
[52:58] kidneys are healed
[53:00] and a couple months later he had to go
[53:03] in for his reflux test and sure enough
[53:07] his reflux was gone and he never had it
[53:10] again
[53:12] so he never had that one more time so
[53:15] I'm going to leave this story for just a
[53:17] minute and we're going to come back to
[53:19] it because I want to just talk briefly
[53:20] really briefly
[53:23] yeah I've held you a really long time
[53:24] but we're almost done so
[53:28] so anyway the Lord has worked all this
[53:30] out
[53:32] and
[53:33] and I I thought about this with with
[53:36] Joshua
[53:37] you know one day that that Joshua and
[53:40] the children of Israel are around
[53:41] Jericho
[53:43] and they're marching around
[53:45] you know and when they get there
[53:47] maybe it doesn't seem like much
[53:49] because they're marching around and
[53:52] marching around so first day they show
[53:54] up somebody's in Jericho looking out
[53:56] over the wall he says Captain Captain
[53:57] the Israelites are out there he's like
[54:00] what are they doing does it look like
[54:01] they're attacking no they're just
[54:03] walking
[54:04] they're just walking around
[54:06] he's like well are they armed well they
[54:08] don't have any weapons out they got some
[54:10] trumpets they got some priests with an
[54:11] arc and and they've got Joshua but no
[54:15] they're just walking
[54:17] and the next day
[54:18] what are they doing up they're just
[54:20] walking
[54:21] then the next day what are they doing oh
[54:23] they're out there walking one time
[54:25] around then they stop I don't know day
[54:27] six what are they doing they're just
[54:30] walking
[54:31] what are they doing I don't know same
[54:34] thing they just walk around
[54:35] got their Ark got Joshua you know
[54:38] they're just walking
[54:39] and then comes day seven
[54:41] and he's like hey Captain hey the
[54:44] Israelites are walking again he's like
[54:45] okay they've been doing that for the
[54:46] past six days yeah but they've got some
[54:48] fervency now
[54:49] so they're going a lot faster today
[54:52] how many times have they been around oh
[54:53] three well now four oh eight uh five six
[54:58] oh it's now seven times
[55:00] because they've got some urgency
[55:02] right seventh day a little bit of
[55:04] urgency in them
[55:06] and then all of a sudden they stop
[55:08] and they start blowing horns and they
[55:11] start shouting and the walls start
[55:13] shaking and the walls come tumbling down
[55:16] and what was it that did it
[55:19] it was a simple thing they're walking
[55:22] they got trumpets this is a walled City
[55:24] I mean it's it's a fortress and you're
[55:26] not getting in there and there's people
[55:28] on the other side of that wall that are
[55:29] armed and ready for you to come in
[55:32] but all they did was walk and all they
[55:34] did was walk and then eventually it gets
[55:37] to that seventh day and they've got some
[55:38] urgency because it's getting closer to
[55:40] the time when they're going to defeat
[55:41] their enemies and get out of there
[55:42] they're going to take over Jericho and
[55:44] and and move on to something greater
[55:48] right so they're walking around and
[55:50] walking around and walking around and
[55:52] they're going to take over Jericho
[55:54] and I thought about that in this
[55:56] particular story
[55:57] so before I lose you on the on the on
[56:00] our definition
[56:02] I need my assistant to help me
[56:05] are you willing to help me
[56:06] okay
[56:07] so do you want to tell everybody what
[56:09] that thing was
[56:11] okay you can just do you want to
[56:13] announce it from there
[56:15] okay go ahead
[56:20] it's a paper clip
[56:22] that whole definition is for a paper
[56:25] clip
[56:26] so you actually know more sometimes than
[56:29] you think you know and it just depends
[56:31] on how it's explained to you as to what
[56:33] it is that you know so going back to
[56:36] that testimony in the 70s
[56:40] her parents go to Israel
[56:42] they've got tests and trials but they're
[56:44] walking
[56:45] right they're going through their life
[56:47] in in the 80s more family moves back to
[56:50] Israel
[56:52] got tests and trials marriage comes
[56:54] things happen they're still walking
[56:57] coming to the 90s and then we've got a
[56:59] baby that's born and a bunch of Prayers
[57:01] go out
[57:03] but I want you to consider this
[57:05] the simple thing that was happening
[57:08] that was taking place already was they
[57:10] were just walking
[57:12] all they were doing was living their
[57:14] lives
[57:15] Right Moves I you know I we could argue
[57:18] whether moves are simple or not I'm sure
[57:20] the kids would say a move was simple it
[57:21] was no problem you know I just pretty
[57:23] much got in the car and we drove to the
[57:25] next place I got out of the car and kind
[57:26] of helped mom and dad a little bit but
[57:27] for the most part I played it was
[57:29] awesome
[57:30] but for those that are moving it's like
[57:32] this is complicated it's a lot of things
[57:33] and you got a lot of prayer and but how
[57:36] many people have moved
[57:37] in your life
[57:39] it's it's a common thing right it's a
[57:41] simple thing we do it all the time now
[57:43] most of us don't move to Israel I'll
[57:45] Grant you that's a little more
[57:45] complicated but a lot of us have moved
[57:47] States in fact in this room multiple
[57:49] people I know have moved States I've
[57:51] done it several times myself we're just
[57:53] living our life right
[57:55] so here are these people they're just
[57:56] living their life they're just going
[57:58] through and they're walking
[58:00] right their their lives are maybe full
[58:02] of Trials and tests but they're walking
[58:04] and you know what they're walking is
[58:06] doing it's working its way to a miracle
[58:10] because all they're walking led to
[58:13] something else so before we ever prayed
[58:16] before we ever thought about what do
[58:18] what do we want to have happen here
[58:20] because we didn't know there was a
[58:22] problem until he's born and in fact the
[58:24] day that he's born we don't even think
[58:25] there's a problem until he starts
[58:27] throwing up because he looks very
[58:29] healthy everything looks great but
[58:30] inside there was a problem so our
[58:33] prayers start to happen in the 90s but
[58:36] God what people are walking he's already
[58:38] fixing that problem way back then
[58:41] everything is already working out and I
[58:45] have no in fact it took me years before
[58:46] I realized what had happened
[58:49] because you're just walking you don't
[58:51] realize that that God's doing something
[58:53] simple and that's something simple the
[58:56] next time it happens something simple
[58:57] and but it's actually really complicated
[59:01] but they were just walking
[59:03] and we ended up walking right into a
[59:05] miracle because God was already working
[59:07] all that stuff out before we ever prayed
[59:09] so I want to encourage you today there
[59:11] might be simple things that you're doing
[59:13] maybe today you're just walking
[59:16] and as as the time of the Lord
[59:18] approaches you're going to start being
[59:19] walking a little bit more fervently
[59:20] Maybe
[59:21] right because there's a change there's a
[59:24] body change coming and I I can tell you
[59:26] right now there's a number of people
[59:28] that have said I don't know there's just
[59:29] an urgency now like I feel like I have
[59:32] to get closer to the Lord I feel like
[59:34] there's something that's gotta that has
[59:36] to happen and all these things have been
[59:39] simple things moving along but a
[59:41] complicated or a complex God has been
[59:44] fixing it Satan likes to throw
[59:46] complexity in your life to draw you away
[59:49] but the simple truth is and this simple
[59:52] thing is just like you learned on
[59:53] something you know more than you think
[59:55] and sometimes we as preachers we we we
[59:58] get a little bit confusing because we
[1:00:00] try and make things so deep and the
[1:00:02] reality is it's really simple
[1:00:04] repent and be baptized you'll receive
[1:00:06] the gift of the Holy Ghost it's very
[1:00:08] simple brother Branham it's just simple
[1:00:10] Faith he says just like getting in your
[1:00:12] car or walking
[1:00:14] that same faith that brings the Holy
[1:00:16] Ghost into your life is the same faith
[1:00:17] that allows you to realize that that
[1:00:19] God's the same yesterday and today and
[1:00:21] forever there's not a Dogma that you
[1:00:23] have to worry about there's not a
[1:00:24] doctrine that you have to worry about
[1:00:25] what what you need is just that Joshua
[1:00:28] walking with you right and when that
[1:00:31] Joshua is walking with you you can walk
[1:00:33] right into a miracle or you can be
[1:00:36] somebody else's miracle and not even
[1:00:37] know it and that's okay you don't have
[1:00:39] to know everything you just have to
[1:00:41] trust in him why don't you stand with me
[1:00:42] this evening
[1:00:45] because sometimes we can walk
[1:00:48] and walk and walk
[1:00:51] and that simple Act of walking and
[1:00:53] Christian humility
[1:00:55] because brother Brandon spent a lot of
[1:00:56] time talking about just be a simple
[1:00:58] humble Christian
[1:00:59] why would he do that
[1:01:01] why was it necessary to do that
[1:01:04] we're going to have Emma since we're
[1:01:05] going to have Emma sing Emma if you want
[1:01:07] to make your way up
[1:01:11] sorry about that
[1:01:17] I just wanted to sing and then we'll
[1:01:19] sing some congregational songs but I
[1:01:20] just I I just want to encourage you
[1:01:23] today that just in your Christian walk
[1:01:25] just it doesn't have to be this Grand
[1:01:28] thing it can be you just living your
[1:01:31] life and and being a simple humble
[1:01:34] Christian that can make a difference for
[1:01:36] somebody else it can change somebody's
[1:01:39] destination we went from being in the
[1:01:41] Make-A-Wish Foundation to not being in
[1:01:43] it and in fact my son now is 25 25.
[1:01:51] so they said he wouldn't live past a
[1:01:52] teenager if if he couldn't get off the
[1:01:55] the feeding that he was on he wouldn't
[1:01:57] live past that time and if his if his
[1:02:00] kidneys didn't change that he would have
[1:02:02] to have surgery to fix that and then
[1:02:04] they also tried to talk us into by the
[1:02:06] way giving him growth hormones because
[1:02:08] he was really stunted in growth and they
[1:02:11] said even with growth hormones he would
[1:02:12] only be five foot two and so he prayed
[1:02:15] earnestly about that he ended up over
[1:02:16] five foot four without growth hormones
[1:02:19] they said it wasn't possible
[1:02:21] God deals in impossibilities and all you
[1:02:24] have to do is walk in it that's all you
[1:02:26] got to do
[1:02:27] right you these are simple things are
[1:02:30] our Warfare is not with the big weapons
[1:02:33] or even pots or lamps or any of those
[1:02:35] things but it's with an anointed king
[1:02:37] and it's with the Holy Ghost and in
[1:02:40] simple things you can overcome your
[1:02:42] enemy
[1:02:43] with with the love of God in your heart
[1:02:44] you can overcome whatever you need to in
[1:02:46] this life you can have peace that passes
[1:02:49] all understanding you can have joy in
[1:02:51] your salvation and you can have joy even
[1:02:54] when it feels like the world is closing
[1:02:56] in around you because you've got a god
[1:02:58] that is able to do something in your
[1:03:00] lives simply plainly he's more than able
[1:03:04] to do it
[1:03:05] and saints of God if I could say
[1:03:06] anything to you tonight just walk
[1:03:09] just the act of walking
[1:03:12] a simple humble Christian Life
[1:03:15] just the act of walking with the Lord
[1:03:16] will do it for you Emma why don't you go
[1:03:18] ahead and sing your song
[1:03:20] [Music]
