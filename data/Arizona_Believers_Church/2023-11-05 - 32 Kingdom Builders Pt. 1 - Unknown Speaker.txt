TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I love reading those scriptures on the Millennium it's a subject that uh in times past when I'd get to fellowshipping on it I remember one time I was with uh brother Jim Pinkston in his home and we got to fellowshipping on the Millennium uh brother Lucas you probably weren't too far away maybe within some vicinity of there but we were fellowshipping on the Millennium and it just got so exciting that I felt like I just wanted to run out of the house and start just doing laps uh in his yard because it's a really exciting thing to think about because whatever it's going to be you don't have to worry about missing it if you're God's elect and I know there's a lot of things that are a little bit mysterious and uh hard to figure out even if you take all the quotes that brother brandham said about and all the scriptures sometimes it's really hard just to nail down real precisely what it's going to be but we knew that we do know it's going to be and that rest is going to be glorious and there's so much that's represented in that Kingdom we were drawn a lot from that on Wednesday night today though I want to take the subject of Kingdom Builders and that would be my title today today as Kingdom Builders I I feel I have one more part in this so we'll just call this part one and maybe next Sunday if the Lord would lead we might be able to just wrap up this series we've been doing on the kingdom but I want to take this uh title of Kingdom Builders and when I say that I know that we might initially think about a lot of different things I know for me I've had kind of the the phrase the vernacular of different individuals who like to lift themselves up they're building their own kingdoms and so I don't mind if you think about that in the sense of uh the negative side of Kingdom building but we're not going to take it that direction in Isaiah 11:9 we've been drawing from this extensively they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea I believe this scripture is important to understand just exactly how uh these verses 6 seven and 8 unfold and how that we see the wicked even being slain and a righteousness reigning on the earth it's because the Earth is full of God's judgment it's full of his opinion and his discernment there's the correct understanding of things that holds sway that is is dominating if I could say it's the character of God that's going to have preeminence in the world during that time and there'll be an intimate understanding of God's will there's going to be a a submission to his word and that's why everything's at rest just as brother brandham brought forth the Garden of Eden everything was bringing forth of its kind and it had to because it was God's word and each seed bringing forth and that was what we call a millennial condition and we know we use that phrase to refer to A Thousand Years but this is what began in the garden this condition this rest this glory and so under the reign of the king of righteousness as we read it in those first few verses uh all Natures changed where there's enity and where there's animosity and where there were certain animalistic instincts those things are gone and peace is ruling and reigning and I will TR I want to pick up very quickly where we were I believe last Sunday to say this is the power of the spirit that the Bible says in verse two there Isaiah 11: 2 and3 and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him so this is the power of the spirit this is the spirit that brings this Perfection that brings this condition and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord this is where we want to zero in on the true nature of the spirit of God and the the the character and the influence of the spirit that if the spirit is influencing something and the spirit is on something it's going to have certain characteristics that it manifest and so we're looking at the true character of the influence of the spirit of the Lord and as we said before not just a baptism not just a a a a spirit that can move in a meeting and the spirit can move in the meeting and it can manifest itself in a lot of ways that we know can be impersonated genuine move of God can cause a lot of a lot of manifestations it's genuine Spirit uh genuine Spirit even on false seed can produce genuine manifestations of the spirit but even those manifestations can be impersonated so what we're talking about here when it says the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him it's showing kind of that immutable evidence of the spirit of the Lord and it saying the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord those are things that indicate not just a move of the spirit or a manifestation of the spirit but a real indwelling of the Holy Ghost and as the Bible says in Zechariah not by might not by power so it's not it's not the carnal listic things and efforts and discipline it says but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts and there's a way that his Spirit Works verse three and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord this is notice those words the spirit of the Lord manifest in the spirit of wisdom and understanding counsel and might knowledge and fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord he shall not judge after the side of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears that clearly speaks to discernment looking past the surface being able to see beyond certain markers and characteristics that we're kind of trying to read the tea leaves we're trying to read the red flags we're trying to figure things out on an external level he can look past the outward and he can see the inward because that's what the spirit does it searches all things yay the Deep things of God now that's review I think for all of us there and just a little bit more review I'm trying to parallel what I've been doing at least over the last several services but there's been a lot of just building through this parallel our future home with our current condition or position in Christ certain things we can look at that eth day and see that these things are going to be the Perfection perfect realization but yet there's characteristics and aspects of that that help us to understand our current position in Christ and it's inspired by brother brandham saying if I could just get one thing across to you in future home it's the Plan of Redemption to see the image of redemption in the earth and the image of redemption in the individual and that just builds when you conceive that you realize there's things right now as a Christian who has the holy spirit of God inside of me that are true now that are one day going to be perfectly true for everything right and for the world and so we see that the reign of Christ establishes a his Reign on earth establishes a Thousand-Year reign of peace reign of righteousness where it'll be supremely under his guidance it'll be under his instruction as it says that the by the breath of his mouth he's going to slay the wicked and as he speaks uh he's going to uh going to Smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth with his breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked there's going to be the word which is going to hold sway he under his guidance and his instructions could to be ruled by his discernment thousand years of Peace even to where animal life and everything's getting along and this is what Christ can do in our hearts right now if we let him have preeminence as King this is what Christ can do in our hearts right now now if you could just walk with me very quickly through several scriptures because I'm wanting just to identify this Spirit of the Lord which is the spirit of wisdom and understanding Spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge in the fear of the Lord to make us of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord that we might have discernment and recognize this is a consistent theme in the New Testament Ephesians 3:1 17- 21 he says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith now that's the that's the indwelling of Christ this is what he's praying this is the prayer that he has for these believers who are being positionally placed that Christ May dwell in your heart Hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and length and depth and height so that's that's the full scope and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him we dealt with the fullness so I think these are just again review scriptures now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think so he's the one that can do above according to the power that worketh in us now sometimes we think oh he can do above what we could even ask or think and so we kind of imagine this working that takes place outside of us but he says I want Christ to dwell on your hearts by faith that he who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us so this power and the manifestation above what we can ask or think is according to a power that works in us uh unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without in amen he got so excited he amened what he was writing there's there's a what a beautiful picture that's painted the power that works in us from Christ indwelling in us can do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think so it's beyond ourselves it's beyond our Humanity it's beyond our carnal thinking and this is a consistent theme we could be reading from several more places in Ephesians we've already seen where he's raised us up seated in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus a lot of those images he says in Ephesians chapter 4 that there's going to be those that he's given gifts unto men uh uh for the work of the ministry for the preaching of the word to speak the truth in love that we might grow up into Christ who is the head in all things till we all come in the unity of the faith he says in verse 13 and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man un the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so as Christ dwells in our hearts by faith we're able to comprehend and have this knowledge which passeth knowledge filled with all the fullness of God according to the power that works in us bringing us to the unity of faith that we might comprehend with All Saints so there's a Unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God this is that fullness of God the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledge of God well then I just desire that my mind would be full of the knowledge of God that Spirit would be permeated by the knowledge of God that it wouldn't just be an anchor in my soul and I'm just like well one day it's all going to be over and we'll all be happy and we're going to live well but I want to experience the benefits oh more than ever in my life I want to experience the benefits of that power of God that's on the inside of me Hallelujah the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God in 2 Corinthians 4:6 he says it this way for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ This is why the light shined in your hearts this is why the word uh came to you and it flashed in your soul so that to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ the face of Jesus Christ the revealing of Jesus Christ is to give light of the knowledge of the glory of God this is something that is at the heart of our experience as Christians in Philippians 1: 9 and 10 he says it this way and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment if we are rooted and grounded in love he would desire this Christ dwells in our hearts by faith that we would uh our love would abound yet more and more in a greater depth of knowledge and a more comprehensive discernment being rooted and grounded in love you're to grow in that love and our love is to be without dissimulation to abord that which is evil cleave to that which is good and so here is this working out of this Holy Ghost experience as it shined in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God that it might manifest and abound in more knowledge and in all discernment that you may approve the word there in the Greek approve is discern discern things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ to discern is to perceive or to recognize to detect something to to disting or perceive differences if you have discernment you have some keenness of insight we might call it wisdom uh some sort of perception but it's a it's a a insightful judgment which is correct there's a perception of things that are obscure when someone says uh did you discern that sound it implies that maybe it's not uh you can't perceive it readily right can you detect differences can you discern uh what's off did you sense what was wrong there and that so it's not necessarily if you discern something it's something that's not obvious like nobody discerns that I have a big nose it's like well just just the right angle no it's obvious so there's things that are maybe slight and maybe you don't see right off and you take some time just to pick up on it that's what discernment is it's a depth of knowledge it's a is more comprehensive discernment and that he says that you may be sincere and without offense so this is what brings sincerity when brother BR says we must be more sincere and he relates that story in the B and the angel of the Lord said you must be more sincere we said well how how can I get sincere I can't take my shoes off enough I can't humble myself enough I can't lay enough on the ground low enough and so how do I become more sincere here's here's the secret to sincerity it says that that this knowledge of the Lord in all judgment that you may be sincere means to judge right and be judged right having a single eye to the very best things amen you want to be more sincere you need more understanding of the word of God you want to be more sincere you need more knowledge of the word of God that's what it takes to be sincere not a false humility not a bowing ourselves artificially but we need to really know the love of God we really need to know the magnitude of God and trust me with that knowledge will come a humility true knowledge and insight into the nature and character of God and just to know his love for us more and more does what it humbles us more and more it's that knowledge and this discern that brings the sincerity to be sincere is to be examined by the Sun's light and be found pure when examined under scrutiny under the light found pure that we may be sincere in order to be sincere we have to have the knowledge that he's talking about here and all judgment amen sincere and without offense means not striking against or stumbling you can say not led into sin but to be blameless I think the Greek word is smooth right don't we all want to be smooth that it's we be found sincere without offense how is it we can be smoothed out how is it we can be sincere well this is a very pointed uh few scriptures we put together here I think to declare this it's that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith amen and as we begin to comprehend him as he begins to grow in us and that power that works within us brings us to a Unity of faith faith in the knowledge of the Son of God giving the light of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord will give us a more comprehensive discernment a greater understanding that brings sincerity that brings this without offense if I could phrase it this way knowledge of the word of God I'm talking about true knowledge not book learning but knowledge of the word of God or knowledge by the word of God has the effect of purging amen knowledge by the word of God as Paul is writing it here that we may abound more in knowledge and in all judgment that your love would abound yet more and more in all knowledge and in all judgment it has the effect of cleaning and purifying Psalms 199 says wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to Thy Word how do how are we cleansed how are we Pur by the word of God it's the word that does the washing it's the word that does the cleaning it's the word that does the perfecting and so the word of God knowledge by the word of God purges it cleanses it pushes out when I say knowledge by the word of God I want you to think of spiritual understanding Revelation yes Paul says it this way in Galatians 5:16 I brought my tepid tea to the pulpit tonight to this this morning oo tonight Glory this is going to be a good one this morning uh just to keep my my throat going Galatians chapter 5:1 16 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh we've all read it before right we've all read it we've read it walk in the spirit you not fulfill the lust of the flesh how many of us wrestle with it how how many of us try to figure out well I mean what it means is right or we just try to but I think it's an absolute right if you can walk in the spirit it suggests it's impossible for you to act to satisfy the lust of the flesh read it as an absolute walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the Flesh and if any time you find yourself satisfying the lust of the flesh correct yourself with these words I must not be in the spirit don't condemn yourself just correct yourself I remember one time I'd been serving the lord maybe not for very long maybe may have been a year and I went away think was after I graduated from college and I'd went away for a few weeks and I came back home and found out that they had had a big garage sale and sold some of my stuff while I was gone sold my trumpet and uh and I said Hey where's my trumpet and my mom said we sold it at the garage sale and so I just said I'm officially In the Flesh I mean at that moment I knew this is I'm not operating according to the spirit I'm officially in My Flesh and that's what we can say to ourselves sometimes we realize I've been nudged a little bit I'm not walking in the spirit but this to me seems to be an absolute walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the how many have ever heard of the sermon how can I overcome and brother bradman's very intro to that is talking about overcoming and he says we should never let the spirit of Revival die this is this is what his subject is I want to speak to you today because I I don't I think that we should never let the spirit of Revival die how can I overcome means how can I keep the spirit of revival going in my life because that's what Revival is yes sir walk in in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of a dead flesh you shall not walk after deadly things things that pretend to to destruction and Corruption and brother BR in many different places describes and and I realize now maybe open up the door to a much larger subject that I've been uh studying on so it satisfies me just to say these few things and maybe it'll create a little bit of a thirst for you but brother B says in many different places how a true Revival washes out all unbelief and there might be a lot of movement right there might be a lot of uh uh shaking around and a lot of things taking place but brother Braham says says at the end of the the true Revival surfaces the trash to get rid of it and that would be that would be the mark of a real Revival that'd be the true fruits of a Revival how many times did Brother brandham correct the the the manifestation of the spirit in meetings and church services and people could shout dance and speak with tongues and scream and do all sorts of manifestations it could be a move move and even you can say maybe not even a workup but he would correct their manner of dress their manner of living the how they with cut hair and painted nails and all the other things that he called out and he said this is this is not a Revival unless that changes because the true fruits of Revival washes out unbelief good that's the spirit's moving and spirit's moving it may get may get you excited I have a statement uh that I was going to read and it's maybe a little lengthy but brother BR talks about it I'm just paraphrasing if you want it I can share with you about how if everybody's all excited you're going to get excited too he's he's basically of course yes but what you want is not just that you want it to move and stir in very deep ways so that it's cleaning out the trash and I and I would say this I guess the statement is if it takes eating apples to cause us to recognize causes women to recognize they're naked past the apples and I would say if if it's if it's certain things it takes for us to clean our lives up then I say let's do it but I know no better way to clean our lives up and have a Revival than the word of God Amen walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh walk speaks to your manner of Life how you live how you think how you judge he picks it back up in verse 25 and notice what he says if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit if we live in the spirit in other words if you've been quickened by the spirit and again I think you should take this as an absolute to recognize Paul acknowledges if we've been revived by the spirit your Soul's been quickened you've been resurrected from the dead spiritually passed from death into life if you live in the spirit having been made Alive by the new birth then he's saying then walk in the spirit one is a certainty if you've been born again the other is an opportunity of the born again he says if you walk in the spirit spirit I say walk in the spirit and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh so he says if you've been quickened by the spirit then just live in it or walk in the spirit let us follow his guidance and all of our estimations and all of our words and our temperaments and our actions follow it every minute of every day if possible amen yielding to his Spirit if you've been quickened by it he says walk in it John 14:2 6 this is the nature of the spirit I hope this isn't too much of a step forward in this but he says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so it's the inside teacher it's the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost is the inside teacher and I emphasize that in the sense that it it doesn't matter well the most important aspect is that you would have the inside teacher so that if the holy spirit is anointing a minister to preach or to teach and to preach the word of God you have the spirit on the inside that's teaching you by that word because no matter how good a preacher is how anointed a preacher can be and no matter how anointed teaching can be and some of the most powerful anointings I've ever experienced in church services with when the teaching of the word was going forth and so it's not just a certain manner in which it's being preached it's the word that brings the anointing and no matter how anointed it could be if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not going to go any further in the word in a real way in spirit and Truth until you get the inside teacher there's there's that that aspect of the inside teacher the Holy Ghost this is the nature of the Holy Ghost he's going to teach you all things bring all things to your remembrance somebody touch your neighbor and say all things nobody nobody even did it my goodness just say all things he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you this is the spirit of the Lord this is the spirit of wisdom and understanding this is how you're made of quick understanding the fear of the Lord to judge not after your sight but reprove or reprove after the hearing of your ears this is the teacher the holy ghost that comes on the inside who's going to teach you all things and bring all things that you were taught to your remance so he just doesn't want to teach it to you he wants to teach it to you and then reme reminds you of it because notice he teaches you all things first and then he can bring the things that he talk to you back to your remembrance that's right okay you with me yes all right page two Revelations chapter 1 verses 10 11 and 12 I'm using this because of some statements that brother brownon makes are just very very orienting uh to some things but it was this aspect as we're looking at the spirit that rest upon the Messiah during the millennial Reign and it's that Messiah that's ruling in your heart right now right that's the one that's in your heart right now so this is the spirit of the Lord this is the spirit of wisdom and understanding in Revelations 1 10 verse 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day now notice if I can say this the meaning the purpose and the meaning of being in the spirit I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day the very first thing that John says is and heard he doesn't mention anything else his weeping comes later right the emotions maybe come later I was in the spirit of the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet saying and who does he hear the voice of Jesus Christ I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia under Ephesus and under Smyrna and under pergamus and under thyra and under Sardis and under Philadelphia and under leoda this is what he hears when he's in the spirit on the Lord's day he hears this voice and this is what's happening and then is he still in the spirit on the Lord's day I turned to see so he hears and sees and now not only has he heard the voice but he's turned and he sees the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks I hope that can just kind of wash over you that beautiful picture I was in the spirit of the Lord on the Lord's day and I heard and what I heard caused me to turn and when I turned I saw what I saw is him I saw him and what he was and what he would be this is what it means to be in the spirit of the Lord it means I can hear and hear the voice see Christ and he receives the revelation of Jesus Christ when he was in the spirit of the Lord I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and what does it do he hears it turns him he sees this is what it means to be in the spirit somebody says they're in the spirit and they're not hearing the word of God it's not causing them to turn and they're not seeing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I don't know it it may be the spirit but I don't know if you're in the spirit that's good brother Brandon picks picks this up in patas Vision just taking those five words I was in the spirit goes isn't that just beautiful my I love that love I love his formal writing style you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life let's let's focus on this now if we're going to live live as Christians we have to be in his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own Spirit one it's important for us to understand this right because some people's Spirits everyone's different and you you meet some people and one spouse is really really talkative and the other one's quiet and it's just nature it's their own natures and it's just the way they are and someone's own Spirit can be more exuberant more expressive and more uh more animated someone else can be a little bit more reserved and you could just be showing your own Spirit by the way you handle yourself but here he's saying not John was not in his own spirit that would not have brought these Visions it had to be the spirit of God Amen it has to be the spirit of God with us too or all our efforts are in vain Paul said I will pray in the spirit I will sing in the spirit I will live in the spirit if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it Bears write it down print it out put it on a bumper sticker make a sticker for your water bottle get a bigger one if it won't fit this is perfect if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it bears as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus so how what be received what was this Mark in this characteristic he's in the spirit receiving tremendous Revelations we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit this is at the real heart of what it means to be in the spirit we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given us to live by in his words that's beautifull I say Amen to that this is at the real heart of what it means to overcome and how can I keep the Revival how do I keep the spirit of Revival Never Dying well you need to have a church service every night on you need to get a really good organ player you need a screaming B3 up here and you need everything just get the music just right and we can keep the spir has nothing to do with it that's nothing to do with it we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given us to live by in his word for it is the same Spirit don't get me wrong I love a screaming B3 I love a good organ so getting out let me I let me just go ahead and continue to read a little bit more brother Bram is and I'm just before we go to Ephesians chapter 1 I'll just bring this in right here brother Brown is talking about in this very continuing In this passage he says look at it this way he says people read in Acts 238 uh but they don't they just pass right on so I see it in the word of God they just move right on what do they do it's right there in the word of God but they'll move right on and they'll find the sound bite that they like baptize the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost they just pass right on what they they see one oh no that's that's that does this and that does that and that's then they just start knocking down all these other things in the word of God he says they just pass right on he says if they saw it by getting in the spirit right they would know that they need to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he says they never get in his spirit or would happen to them exactly as the word says amen so he says pray for God pray to God for Revelation by his spirit that is the first step get in the spirit so you tell me what it is it mean to get in the spirit getting in the spirit is is to have Revelation by his spirit that is the first step get in the spirit by this Revelation he says don't and he's talking about uh another illust frustration of people trying to be healed and and he says that they they get a they if we did how they ask God to do this and do that suppose you need healing what does the word say well we' we've all read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask God for a spirit to teach us the real truth of it he says all we need this to get in the spirit and then things will be done amen don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what God will do yes sir so get in the spirit of it the revelation of it the stimulation of it Ephesians chap 1: 17-23 notice how closely this language tracks Isaiah chapter 11 says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him Hallelujah the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him is the working of his mighty power amen that we might know the hope of his calling the riches of his glory and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he told us it's the power that works in us this is the real power of the Holy Ghost this is is the real manifestation of the spirit Hallelujah that it would give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him and unless you someone tried to confuse my language and twist it it's not it's not just a knowledge that's yeah well I I got it all right here this is a knowledge with power this is a this is when you get in this Spirit you get the Revelation the acts will happen God will perform his word he says you'll know it by by a revelation by his word confirmed by the word and then it'll be made manifest by the results it Bears so don't for a second think that this is not there's not going to be a result of your Revelation that there's not a manifestation of your Revelation but listen Revelation there is no impersonation of Revelation there's just demonstration touch your neighbor and say demonstration that God may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation because this is the working of his mighty power brother Bram writes in the church age book yes Satan hates re hates Revelation but we love it Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them with what Revelation with Revelation you will prevail over all the tactics of the enemy you will prevail over all the gates of the enemy you will recall the I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages amen then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people Revelation takes the operation of the Holy Ghost it'll take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God it'll require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or never becomes clear let this sink in this is so important a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know notice how much this would be corrective to the Pentecostalism of his day where the yielding brother I'm talking about just let they talk about oh just let your mind go blank right and there was this yielding to just whatever move just yield yourself now and and maybe if I push on you hard enough you'll yield to the floor and there's a certain yielding to certain manifestations In the Flesh in the physical uh way that we could yield to the spirit and see how much it's going to declare and to shout and dance and how much you're going to cry all that is wonderful we all enjoy a good a good weeping session a a good a good shouting and dancing and how how good that feels but this is where we really need it he says yield to be to the spirit to hear and know as I've already said this book Revelation is the consummation of the scriptures mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear we need to lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know this is the consummation of scripture it is even placed exactly right in the Canon of scripture at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil a lot of good Liners in here it is the revelation of God that'll give you authority over the devil and you can see why they would what add or take why they could who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy good amen on there's your overcoming Revelation it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word it's a revelation of God that'll give you Authority there's nothing such prevailing power as a revelation of the word wow this is the working of his mighty power in US amen this is the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him this is their understanding being enlightened see in verse three is a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book I think this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priest reading to the the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them as long as it was the word the blessing was there it didn't matter if it was read or heard that's the power of the word and he says we need to be yielded to the spirit to hear and know I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day caused John to hear to turn to see to see the things unfold in future ages to have an understanding to get this revelation of Jesus Christ that he writes down in the Book of Revelation we see these consistent themes and I know these are things that you've heard many many times but this is the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might to cause you to be full of the knowledge of the the Lord in 2 Timothy 3: 1516 and 17 it says and from that and that from a child as he's writing to Timothy brother Bram said as long as it's the word there's a blessing it didn't matter if it was read or heard just talking about how perfect the scriptures are if anyone would add to or take away Paul speaking of the word of God says that from a child that H has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all scriptures given by the Breath of God by inspiration of God and all scriptures profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness these are the different varied aspects of the word of God as he says that we need the teaching of the holy spirit that we need the Myster requires to teach of the spirit or it never becomes clear we need the inside teacher we need the word of God to be taught we need the Holy Ghost working on both ends and from a child you've known the scripture he says those scriptures are able to make you wise through faith in Jesus Christ so the very word of God by Revelation can bring wisdom the revelation of the word of God Revelation by the spirit is going to bring wisdom and understanding and knowledge it's good for Doctrine reprove correction instruction and righteousness and then Paul makes this statement that the man of God may be perfect truly furnished Uno all good works walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh if we live in the spirit then we should also walk in the spirit what happens when you walk in the spirit you grow in wisdom and understanding your love abounds in more knowledge and comprehensive discernment as that grows it pushes things out it gives you understanding you know what I figured it out I followed the breadcrumbs I when I do this I've learned it's because I did this this this this and this and you're able to use some forensics right do some data analytics on your own life and say I figured out the problem and that's a spirit of wisdom and understanding to know how to approach problems know how to overcome know how to address things in your life oh hallelujah praise be to God who gives us wisdom and understanding that the man of God may be perfect well how is the man of God made perfect the teaching of the spirit the word of God giving you the revelation of the word being profitable for Doctrine reprove correction instruction and righteousness that you might be thly furnished brother Bram in the sermon spiritual food and due season I want to come back

want to be dressed in his righteousness clothe me fully completely I want to be thoroughly furnished thoroughly adorned and finished out I don't want to live in a bare housee I don't want to sleep in a room with no bed furnish it finish it out put up the molding texture everything finish this building thly furnished now this is going to start summarizing a lot of things that we focused on earlier in this series and I know it's been 30 something Parts but in habac 2: 12 to 14 woe to him that builth a town with blood establishe a city by iniquity brother John was fat was sharing with me just how much he could see the image of Cain in that and what we can see is an image of mystery Babylon right a town so that wasn't me disagreeing I just said but John was struck by that and I saw incredible similarities how he named a city after his son and he built this watching place it was built by Blood it's built in the fear of blood being shed built by iniquity and that being a seed of even that City that comes in the end called the mystery Babylon built on pride and pretense a memorial to man this is what was built up it's a memorial to man it's a boasting even we see the tiwer bible let us build us a city by Blood and by iniquity and this is verse 13 it shows us the vanity of their carnal labor behold it is not of the Lord of hosts that the people should labor in the very fire that the people should weary themselves for vanity and so I ask what are you building you building your own kingdom or you building his at the end of the day is it just another mystery Babylon or is it the mystery of God cuz what a Razor's Edge What a fine line as it brings this the Spectre woe to him that builds a town with blood and establishes a city by iniquity what are we building what what is what are the what are the materials I'm using to build my testimonium what materials are we using Even in our testimony of our church and our our Ambitions and what we emphasize and what we say is important if we if we took our testimony which are stones and we and we take all these things and we start trying to add them up what are we building if everything we say and everything we support and a brother was talking we're desirous to have and I didn't get any feedback on whether or not they scheduled it or not but we're hoping to have a Brother's breakfast uh this coming Saturday is that still a go I don't know it is a go we're announcing it right now how do you like that top billing next Saturday the Lord will and you want to have a Brother's breakfast and some of the the burning desire in the brother's Hearts is that I just don't want to get together and talk about sports right I that doesn't or hunting right that's not what you want that doesn't want to be added all up what is it that has preeminence what is the story we're telling as we Fellowship about things and give emphasis to things the question is what are we building Hallelujah the iron of me saying that while I'm wearing baseball cuff links because the Texas Rangers finally won a World Series but notice verse 14 for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea Now isn't that a striking turn of events yes wo to him that build a town with blood and establish a city by iniquity behold it's not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity well what okay that's awful that's horrible and the Lord's questioning so here's the answer think for the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea now that's a reminder to the people Jerusalem will be built again the temple will be restored again From the Ashes she will rise from the rubble she will be built up Stone by Stone Brick by Brick the house of God will live again from the dust and from the ruin Jerusalem it would bring to mind the fact it's coming to Kingdom age why would we build a town by Blood why would we establish a city by iniquity why would we labor in the very fire and weary ourselves with vanity when the whole Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord and I would say to you today what is needed right now I ask it as a question what is needed right now and and whatever it is you might begin to elicit well I've got physical problems I've got marital problems I'm I'm in a transition right now in my life I've got a young family we're just starting out in marriage or we're just starting to have children every these different things you might find yourself in all these different stages what would you need to emphasize what should have preeminence what's the first thing we should do a de snowball what's the first thing we should go get blood work done first thing we should do is call upon God for Revelation now this will work as a transition and to some future Services I've been studying I I think maybe we'll just call the next series the house of God it says in Proverbs 4: 3-6 for wisdom is a house building amen and by understanding it is established and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all the precious and pleasant riches now are you God's house are you his building it's built by wisdom established by understanding and through knowledge it's filled with precious and pleasant riches am think of this through wisdom it's built through understanding it's established and by knowledge it's filled how are we going to be filled by knowledge wisdom builds and then it causes it to continue to be built up a wise man is strong yeah a man of understanding increaseth strength there's your knowledge is power for by wise counsel Thou shalt make thy war and in the multitude of counselors their safety brother Dan daisley told me one time he says I've got a scripture for you brother Aaron woe un do you lawyers and I said I've got one for you too wo is me but my answer whenever anybody says something about lawyers is saying the multi to the counselors Hallelujah their safety for by wise counsel Thou shalt make thy War Proverbs 9:1 wisdom hath builded her house she hath heun out her Seven Pillars I'm going to just go quickly here and skip over some of these details we'll get into them it later but this speaks of stability this is the stability and power of wisdom the durability of wisdom wisdom built her house so she rests secure wisdom has he out her Seven Pillars so she's not afraid that it's going to fall through wisdom is a house built not hastily not unadvisedly not ignorantly not just haphazardly but wisdom builds the house and understanding establishes It prepares it arranges it settles it makes it firm stabilizes it and then the house is filled by knowledge it makes it complete and satisfied wisdom builds understanding establishes in knowledge fs and brother Bram says no man knows the things of God Save The Spirit of of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we've accepted the Bible we've accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened we may believe it we may believe it absolutely but if we want it to be real it needs to be made Alive by Revelation musicians if you could come from the sermon indictment what are we building how can we build maybe I asked the question you know what are you building are you building a kingdom to yourself are you building a Babylon or is a Jerusalem being built in you God's wanting to build a kingdom in our hearts and I I'm wanting this to be a Challen a challenging service to challenge us to have a to awaken an appetite for the word of God in our hearts so many voices in the land today so much skepticism about the word so much watering down of the scripture so much uh revisionist history about the message and and and even Jesus Christ and Old Testament New Testament and anymore it's just a kind of a a subjective truth to to each his own and and there's such a watering down so many voices in the land today that would try to take the word and say it's not enough on and say you need the word Plus on when it's the word only now maybe some people have taken word only and made it something that's not on to it's it's not the word at all they say it's the word only but it's no it's only your word but we we should not be afraid of what God Said to take them by at his word what what's the only way you can know you're Overcoming By the word the word the total word all the word and what is it we need besides just like dry reading and just printing out of quotes and the weighing of quotations and we need the revelation of it he says today men Walk ignorantly This is called the indictment they're walking ignorantly and let me say this ignorance is no excuse under the law and just because they were ignorant brother brandham didn't refrain from indicting them they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism whether they think it's intellectualism or fanaticism or some other ISM they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough what what what do they mean by call on God and enough is that mean just shouting screaming he's talking about getting in the spirit of Revelation called on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world not just blowing off steam not just ripping to shred our vocal cords but a heart cry and a longing for Revelation digging down deep enough to get in the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough they just lightly take it oh well I believe there's a God sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes it more some than some people who claim to believe it the devil believes it and trembles people just believe it and just go on but the devil trembles knowing his judgment is coming and people believe it and don't pay no attention to the judgment is coming wow if the devil knowing his judgment's coming makes him tremble what would knowing your deliverance do for you knowing your judgment's been passed and you're sinless what ought it to do for us guilty of crucifying him he says sure I indict this generation finding them Guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning that's right Jesus said who can condemn me he was the word made flesh and today the same word is made flesh and it's the word they crucify and why do they crucify it because they didn't call upon God enough or they don't call upon God enough for Revelation not that they don't call upon God enough but he says they don't call upon God enough to get into the spirit of Revelation so it can be made real to them so they can see past the veneer as we read earlier that people look at the word of God and they say the Bible says oh repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they go ah what they want to find the spot that tickles their ears brother Daniel fory Darko who ministered for us a couple Services he has in his WhatsApp profile picture is someone going with the Q-tip in their ear and and I was like it's got to have some meaning to this I thought it was an mistake or accident very actually the first time you ever texted me I ignored it cuz I had no idea who this person was and uh and then so later on when he talked about it said what is this for he says they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears that's what some people want right they just want to find something that tickles their fancy and since they pass right over they never get into the Revelation up they just shove it aside let's not be like those Q-tip Believers right they just want to itch their ears with certain things that the messenger said and not say Lord I need a revelation by your spirit so I canot fulfill the lust of the flesh if I've been made Alive by the spirit I want to walk in the spirit then I say Lord let through wisdom let this house be built by understanding let it be established CU I want to be a kingdom builder for his kingdom let's stand together and pray
