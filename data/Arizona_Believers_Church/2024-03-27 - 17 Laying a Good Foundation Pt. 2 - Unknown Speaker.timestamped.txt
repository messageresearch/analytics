[0:00] reading in all these places uh you know
[0:02] all these verses on the building of the
[0:04] house of the Lord we've been using this
[0:07] example the house of the Lord to cover a
[0:08] number of different subjects and I'm
[0:10] hoping that tonight as we just go
[0:12] through this a little bit more um you'll
[0:14] be able to piece together some of the uh
[0:16] the thoughts that we've used in the past
[0:18] as we've been building on a lot of
[0:20] things a lot of things connecting
[0:21] together and right in the middle of this
[0:24] series we kind of started venturing into
[0:26] um the concept of headship and uh the
[0:28] roles of fathers and husb husbands and
[0:31] looking at families and family life and
[0:33] home life and that was not uh a mistake
[0:36] that wasn't an accidental exit it's been
[0:38] kind of um before me even on some of
[0:40] these other series that we've ministered
[0:42] on over the last year and a half there a
[0:43] lot of things that we've been addressing
[0:46] um in this S series that we've uh been
[0:49] thinking about a lot in our hearts that
[0:50] God had been dealing with us on so I'm
[0:52] very happy to come into these areas and
[0:54] then uh the subject of the house Lord is
[0:57] just so vast there's so many different
[0:58] ways that you could explore these things
[1:00] that uh you may you might even
[1:02] yourselves just see some tempting areas
[1:04] to go into and things to look at and
[1:05] I've enjoyed the fellowship that I've
[1:07] had with each of you on this I want to
[1:09] continue on this thought of laying a
[1:11] good
[1:12] foundation and using that word
[1:14] foundation even to look at h a founding
[1:17] the beginning of something when it
[1:18] starts and I know that we look at things
[1:21] we say a foundation and a a house that
[1:23] has a foundation or building that has a
[1:24] foundation that would be some uh some uh
[1:28] UND structure that you get touch you
[1:31] could feel but a foundation can even
[1:33] speak to how something starts the way
[1:35] that it starts its timing the manner in
[1:36] which it begins and so we're looking at
[1:39] how something is established how
[1:41] something is set forth and also uh using
[1:44] that solid base of a structure to be an
[1:47] example to us of the beginnings and of
[1:49] the things that we do as Christians and
[1:51] as we were going through it on Sunday we
[1:53] could see in just a number of different
[1:55] scriptures and tonight we'll draw from
[1:57] the message in just a couple places and
[1:59] see just how much the word demonstrates
[2:01] the importance of a foundation whether
[2:04] it be the physical structure that solid
[2:06] base of a structure or even the
[2:08] beginnings of something or the very
[2:11] things that support something and guide
[2:12] something we know that foundations are
[2:15] significant just by how God treats it in
[2:18] the scripture we use Psalms 104:5 on
[2:21] Sunday it speaks of God that uh the Lord
[2:24] as it speaks in verse one uh oh Lord my
[2:27] God Thou Art very great is what he
[2:28] declares in verse one
[2:30] this great God who laid the foundations
[2:32] of the earth that it should not be
[2:34] removed forever his uh he has
[2:38] established it by his power and in
[2:40] establishing it by it P his power upon
[2:43] these foundations it cannot be removed I
[2:46] may be shaken but it can't be removed
[2:49] and this the creation of the earth is
[2:51] compared in this way to building a
[2:53] building and how that you'd begin with
[2:55] the foundation it's got to start off
[2:57] with a solid foundation that it can
[2:59] remain and not be carried away or
[3:00] destroyed he says God laid the
[3:02] foundations of the earth and look at all
[3:04] those times in Scripture that God talks
[3:06] about the foundations the scriptures
[3:07] talk about the foundations of the earth
[3:10] and it's the his foundation that he
[3:12] builds for the Earth that's why the
[3:13] Earth won't be removed forever it's
[3:14] because he put it on a solid basis his
[3:16] word but his foundation manifest his
[3:19] wisdom and power that God just didn't
[3:22] create but in the way that God created
[3:24] he was uh even evolutionary and he and
[3:26] he built and he raised up and he set it
[3:28] upon certain foundations and he
[3:30] supported it with certain laws and this
[3:32] was all so that his creation would exist
[3:35] and subsist and continue on we we
[3:38] concluded our service on Sunday with
[3:40] these verses here in 1 Timothy chapter 6
[3:43] vers 17 18 and 19 now I'm not sure if
[3:46] brother Andrew did such a tremendous job
[3:48] that you all forgot everything that I
[3:50] had said that morning if so that's all
[3:52] right uh my part was archived his wasn't
[3:55] and you can always go back and catch it
[3:57] uh later just to be refreshed but in
[3:59] first Timothy 6: 17 to 19 says charge
[4:03] them that are rich in this world that
[4:05] they be not high minded nor trust in
[4:07] uncertain riches now he's admonishing a
[4:10] certain kind of attitude and a certain
[4:12] kind of action so it's the attitude it's
[4:14] the activity these are things that he's
[4:17] addressing and admonishing and I want
[4:18] you to take from that that Paul is
[4:20] saying do this think this way have this
[4:23] attitude and and think about these
[4:25] things and notice what he comes to that
[4:27] you would trust in a living God who
[4:28] giveth us richly all things to enjoy and
[4:32] then this is part of the activity that
[4:34] they do good that they be riched in good
[4:35] rich in Good Works ready to distribute
[4:38] willing to communicate laying up in
[4:41] store for themselves a good foundation
[4:43] against the time to come that they may
[4:46] lay hold on eternal life so this this
[4:49] attitude and activity that he's
[4:51] encouraging in The Believer is for this
[4:54] reason that they can lay up in store for
[4:57] themselves a good foundation and he says
[5:00] against the time to come in other words
[5:02] for later for what might happen in the
[5:05] future you say well why should I uh
[5:08] trust in a living God and why should I
[5:10] do good and these different things it's
[5:12] very specific and uh precise here we
[5:15] could bring in a lot of other scriptures
[5:16] to show that God is asking you to do
[5:18] these things not necessarily for that
[5:21] very moment that it's somehow some sort
[5:23] of magic potion that whenever you do
[5:24] it's like oh wow isn't that neat but
[5:26] you're doing it because you there's a
[5:28] future and there's things that are going
[5:30] to happen later on down the road so
[5:32] you're doing things now that God asked
[5:34] you to do because God sees all things
[5:36] and he asked you to do something do it
[5:38] now because he sees something coming or
[5:40] he knows the way that we think or the
[5:42] way that we're bit bent a little bit so
[5:44] he's like do these things now and it'll
[5:46] be for you later on when it says that
[5:50] you may lay a good foundation lay a
[5:52] foundation for what for the time to come
[5:55] in other words for what may happen in
[5:56] the future do some do things today for
[5:59] what may happen tomorrow there's going
[6:02] to be a future there's going to be time
[6:03] as brother bam said that there's going
[6:05] to be a future and we have a duty to
[6:06] train our children as if there will be a
[6:08] future think about how maybe some of us
[6:11] were raised in the message during the
[6:13] the 70s and there was just this idea
[6:15] that comes 1977 we're all going to be
[6:17] gone and when that didn't happen I
[6:19] thought well maybe his calendar is just
[6:20] a little bit different than ours and
[6:22] there's no building to a future cuz they
[6:24] didn't think we'd even be here but we
[6:26] have are taught in the word of God that
[6:28] we we plant our potatoes and we live our
[6:30] lives as if we're always going to be
[6:32] here and that's kind of the secret to
[6:35] getting out of
[6:36] here when we have this idea well I think
[6:38] he's coming in the morning or he's
[6:40] already come or whatever it is and we're
[6:41] just kind of Lo you know Blas well we're
[6:44] just going to wait till this happens or
[6:45] waiting for Brother brand to do this
[6:46] wait for that like well then it's never
[6:48] going to happen and and if it does
[6:50] you're going to miss it but so it's like
[6:52] kind of this activity and this
[6:54] attitude of of preparing and working and
[6:57] laboring because God and this is kind of
[6:59] what wanting to express World God is
[7:00] visionary God sees the long term so
[7:02] we're not just kind of twilling our
[7:04] thumbs until we get to the end we're
[7:06] working our way to that if I could say
[7:08] this way knowing what's coming you've
[7:10] got to do things now for that
[7:14] time and so laying a good foundation for
[7:17] the future is what he's saying and we
[7:19] were using that and a lot of the things
[7:21] that we talked about and building on
[7:22] that threshing floor and all the history
[7:24] the rich history of the location of the
[7:26] temple to see that the beginning of
[7:28] something requires great effort I would
[7:31] it maybe even suggest greater
[7:33] effort that as a as something is built
[7:36] and you get to the end whether you're
[7:38] building a house or it's in a project
[7:40] those who work on projects there might
[7:42] be a lot of activity a flurry of
[7:43] activity at the end but when you look at
[7:45] the beginning of something whether it be
[7:46] the planning and whether it be the
[7:48] actual laying the foundation for it like
[7:50] that's when all the really the hard work
[7:53] is done the thoughtfulness and the
[7:55] considering and the planning that's
[7:56] where a lot of these things are worked
[7:58] out and taken into consideration and
[7:59] then when you get to there's just a lot
[8:01] of finishing that's taking place a lot
[8:03] of the expense and the greatest work is
[8:04] in the beginning of something so it says
[8:07] do this to lay a good foundation that's
[8:09] useful suitable commendable admirable
[8:12] genuine approved it's excellent and it's
[8:15] nature and character that good
[8:17] foundation so that it's well adapted to
[8:19] its end and that it's uh it's it's
[8:22] suitable and can be used for its purpose
[8:25] in other words all these things that
[8:26] we're asked to do are a foundation for
[8:28] something that's coming and if you do it
[8:30] you're laying a good foundation and this
[8:32] good foundation requires sacrifice it
[8:34] requires work it requires I said
[8:36] investment in giving that's the kind of
[8:38] the image I'm wanting us all to think
[8:39] and I don't mind if you start to sweat a
[8:41] little bit or get anxious thinking about
[8:42] it because this is the Christian Life is
[8:45] a rugged life and though our souls are
[8:48] at rest and our hearts are at ease in
[8:50] Christ uh he's he's called us to work
[8:53] he's called us to to work and War to to
[8:55] build and to fight and so this this life
[8:58] here is about building things and
[8:59] fighting the devil who's trying to stop
[9:00] what you're building and so we can't uh
[9:03] we can't get lazy and if you start to
[9:04] think man I I didn't realize there was
[9:06] so much effort that we had to put into
[9:07] this of course it's what's going to make
[9:09] the Millennium so much fun is we've
[9:11] already put in the work and so there's
[9:13] some things that uh we've got to do now
[9:16] in a spiritual sense uh because there's
[9:19] a time to
[9:20] come now in 2 Chronicles chapter
[9:23] 8:16 we this scripture I just love how
[9:27] it summarizes so much it says now all
[9:29] the work of Solomon was prepared and
[9:31] we're looking specifically at his labor
[9:33] to build the house of the Lord now all
[9:36] the work of Solomon was prepared unto
[9:38] the day of the foundation of the house
[9:40] of the Lord and until it was finished so
[9:43] all the works prepared in from the
[9:45] foundation to the finishing and then it
[9:47] says so the house of the Lord was
[9:49] perfected this is a process that brought
[9:52] it to its Perfection and the building of
[9:55] the house of the Lord I'll just repeat
[9:56] this over and over in case you forget
[9:58] why we're uh taking our time to examine
[10:00] these things it's an example to us
[10:03] whether we see ourselves in a three-
[10:04] room house or whether we see that our
[10:06] bodies are a temple our home should be a
[10:08] temple the this church is the house of
[10:10] the Lord that all those different types
[10:12] and examples because the house of the
[10:14] Lord is an example that's we want to
[10:16] draw from even the construction of the
[10:19] house of the Lord and Solomon's planning
[10:21] in to see something about
[10:23] ourselves and the foundation of the
[10:25] temple and even the foundation of the
[10:27] earth as we've looked at those things
[10:29] they share similar descriptions and
[10:30] they're how solid they are and how they
[10:32] can't be removed and how permanent they
[10:34] were and it says all the work of Solomon
[10:37] was prepared now if you turn to First
[10:39] Kings chapter 5 I'd like to read verses
[10:42] 1 to 12 this is part of that lengthy
[10:45] reading and when I do this those of you
[10:47] who listen for it you can you can listen
[10:49] for my lisp and get all giddy when I hit
[10:51] it uh but this is uh this is this is
[10:56] Solomon's work and I'm wanting to see
[10:58] all this work was prepared
[10:59] and it has this picture of saying it was
[11:01] well ordered that he knew what he was
[11:04] doing he did it with wisdom he did it
[11:07] with foresight so let's look at the
[11:08] details and just think maybe in bigger
[11:11] picture not so much the foundation right
[11:13] now but bigger picture all the things
[11:15] that are happening even before maybe one
[11:18] thing looks like it's happening on site
[11:20] everything is helping happening in
[11:22] preparation for what is going to happen
[11:25] and look at this wisdom this well
[11:26] ordering and this foresight this Sol has
[11:29] and hyam king of Tyree sent his servants
[11:31] unto Solomon for he had heard that they
[11:33] had anointed him King in the room of his
[11:35] father for ham was ever a lover of David
[11:38] and Solomon went to ham saying thou
[11:40] knowest how that David my father could
[11:43] not build a house under the name of the
[11:45] Lord his God for the wars which were
[11:47] about him on every side until the Lord
[11:49] put them under the souls of his feet but
[11:52] now the Lord my God hath given me rest
[11:55] on every side so that there is neither
[11:56] adversary nor evil occurrent and behold
[12:00] I purpose to build a house unto the name
[12:02] of the Lord my God as the Lord spake
[12:05] unto David my father saying thy son whom
[12:07] I will set upon thy throne in thy room
[12:10] he shall build a house unto thy name so
[12:12] this is Solomon in response to Ham's you
[12:16] know uh congratulations and this
[12:18] Affinity that he had to the family and
[12:21] he and he's sending him uh this uh
[12:24] greetings from his servants he saiding
[12:26] now that I've come to this this is the
[12:28] prophecy that was given and I've
[12:29] purposed in my heart to build so he says
[12:31] now therefore command thou that they
[12:33] heue me cedar trees out of Lebanon and
[12:36] my servant shall be with thy servants
[12:37] and unto thee will I give higher for thy
[12:39] servants according to all that thou
[12:41] shalt appoint for thou knowest that
[12:43] there's not among us any that can skill
[12:45] to Hue Timber like under the
[12:48] sidonians and so this is him realizing
[12:50] we're going to need these things you've
[12:52] got
[12:53] it could you help us in it and I'll
[12:56] provide for you and it came to pass when
[12:59] heard the words of Solomon that he
[13:01] rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the
[13:03] Lord this day which hath given unto
[13:05] David a wise son over this great people
[13:09] so there's something about Solomon's
[13:11] preparation and his foresight in this
[13:14] building to say you know what we've been
[13:16] tasked to build a house but maybe we
[13:18] don't have all the resources and skills
[13:20] that we need to accomplish this and he's
[13:22] willing to ask for help and to get the
[13:24] things he needs and pays for him so he
[13:26] says I see this wisdom and ham sent to
[13:27] Solon saying I have considered the
[13:30] things which thou sentest to me for and
[13:32] I will do all thy desire concerning the
[13:35] timber of Cedar and concerning the
[13:37] timber of fur now I know that when we
[13:39] read this it reads as a story in a way
[13:41] that it's conveying enough information
[13:43] for us to recognize that even if it's
[13:47] politics and these communications but
[13:48] there must have been more that Solomon
[13:50] provided more that Solomon said that
[13:52] this king is now saying oh these are the
[13:55] plans this is what you're doing and now
[13:57] he's thought out how he's going to get
[13:59] all these materials to him because he
[14:00] says my servant shall bring them down
[14:02] from Lebanon unto the sea and I will
[14:04] convey them by sea and floats into the
[14:06] place that thou shalt appoint me and I
[14:08] will cause them to be discharged there
[14:10] and thou shalt receive them and thou
[14:11] shalt accomplish my desire in giving
[14:13] food for my household there's I think
[14:16] there's almost enough elements here for
[14:17] a contract there offer acceptance
[14:20] essential terms a meeting of the minds
[14:23] you're I'm going to give you Timber it's
[14:25] going to be Cedar it's going to be fur
[14:26] this is the way I'm going to deliver it
[14:28] and you're going toay pay me for it this
[14:29] is where it's going to be uh all these
[14:32] things are being thought out
[14:34] beforehand and Solomon gave ham 20,000
[14:37] measures of wheat for food to his
[14:38] household and 20 measures of pure oil
[14:41] thus gave Solomon to ham year by year so
[14:44] it wasn't just a onetime thing this was
[14:46] some this is something that's going to
[14:47] take some time to finish and the lord
[14:50] gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him
[14:54] and there was peace between ham and
[14:55] Solomon and they made a league together
[14:58] this wisdom that is spoken of here is
[15:00] part of how that Solomon all that was
[15:02] prepared that Solomon prepared the work
[15:05] this is the work of Solomon if I say go
[15:07] hearken back to that scripture this is
[15:09] the work of Solon that was prepared and
[15:11] part of that work was in working
[15:13] together with this neighboring King and
[15:15] Kingdom and saying we have need this is
[15:17] what we want to do and he used wisdom in
[15:19] having peace he used wisdom in taking
[15:21] advantage of those relationships and
[15:23] this wisdom that God gave Solomon he
[15:25] used to acquire and to pay for and to
[15:28] achieve the Timber that was going to be
[15:30] needed in the temple temple of SE this
[15:33] the timber of Cedar and defur he was
[15:35] able to get these things that he needed
[15:38] because of his wisdom that God had
[15:40] promised him and as you could see even
[15:43] in First Kings chapter 5 just all the
[15:45] even in these few verses we've read the
[15:47] details that go into building this Great
[15:49] temple says all the work of Solomon was
[15:52] prepared it also speaks that it was
[15:54] carefully considered and accounted for
[15:57] beforehand it was well ordered and it
[15:59] had showed wisdom and foresight and it
[16:02] was prepared means that all the
[16:04] materials were acquired anything that
[16:06] was necessary was fabricated beforehand
[16:09] it was it was procured it was furnished
[16:11] and completed beforehand so that they
[16:13] knew they had everything necessary to
[16:16] finish the building before they even
[16:19] started and to do this that that would
[16:21] take a lot of effort in the
[16:23] beginning Not only would you have to
[16:25] understand what you're building and
[16:27] understand the work and understand what
[16:29] was required and even the engineering
[16:31] you'd have to know this is what we're
[16:33] building this is how big it's going to
[16:34] be built this is how much is required to
[16:36] do this how much is required to do that
[16:38] and it would take considerable uh uh I I
[16:41] would even say Manpower and wisdom and
[16:43] understanding to be able to acquire and
[16:45] accumulate all the resources you need so
[16:47] you can say it's all there we've got the
[16:50] land we've got the Manpower we've got
[16:52] all the tools and building materials we
[16:54] need we can finish this structure God
[16:57] allowing
[16:59] God's Will and God's time will never
[17:01] lack for provision and so they knew
[17:03] God's will they knew it was God's time
[17:04] and they saw the provision so like let's
[17:06] go to work let's build this and if God
[17:08] would show us Grace we have enough to
[17:10] complete
[17:11] it maybe it could have been instructive
[17:14] to them if you're like well we don't
[17:15] have everything we need then it's not
[17:17] time to build we don't have everything
[17:19] it's not time to build there's a a piece
[17:21] that I have as a pastor I think there's
[17:23] a piece that maybe the trustees have
[17:25] that if there's a point at which we feel
[17:27] like these facilities aren't going to be
[17:29] uh big enough for our church that God's
[17:31] going to provide and that the resources
[17:33] will be there in the time that we needed
[17:35] and if if the resources aren't there
[17:36] right now I've got this piece and just
[17:38] believing that it will be if the if the
[17:40] opportunity comes God will provide
[17:42] because God's will and his time will
[17:44] never lack for provision so to be well
[17:47] prepared it's to look and have foresight
[17:51] beforehand this is something that's been
[17:53] part of the the language I've been using
[17:55] maybe for the last few services this
[17:57] foresight this discern The Watchman who
[17:59] sees things I'm wanting to draw on that
[18:02] and speak to the hearts of the parents
[18:03] and the elders that there ought to be
[18:05] some sort of wisdom and understanding
[18:07] that we've acquired in our experiences
[18:09] with God that prepare us for this moment
[18:12] right now for those who are going to be
[18:13] facing the things that we're going to
[18:14] see in the future uh those of us who've
[18:17] been through courtships and we've gotten
[18:18] married and we started to have kids and
[18:20] we've tried to make make ends meet and
[18:22] we've made decisions to move and
[18:23] whatever it might be we've been there so
[18:25] we realize now I can teach something to
[18:28] my children
[18:29] so that they can have the benefit of the
[18:31] wisdom that I've been given by God and
[18:34] hopefully make their path a little bit
[18:37] better I would I would find No Greater
[18:39] Joy than to see my children far exceed
[18:43] me at any juncture in their life than
[18:45] where I was if if my children drive
[18:48] better cars if they get better grades
[18:50] have a better education if they preach
[18:52] better sermons whatever it might be I if
[18:54] they start a church just within five
[18:56] miles from here and it's a better church
[18:57] and the word is pure and the people are
[18:59] pure I would be happy to see that
[19:03] whatever labor we had propelled them and
[19:05] was a foundation for them to far exceed
[19:07] what I was able to do as a parent I
[19:10] can't think of a greater compliment than
[19:12] to see your children outdo you and I I
[19:15] say that humbled by my children's daily
[19:18] efforts to outdo
[19:20] me in
[19:22] everything amen now in Luke 14:
[19:26] 28-30 I think we've read this recently
[19:28] and I I keep F of myself looking at this
[19:31] scripture over and over again like man
[19:32] there's just so much to say here but
[19:34] then it's like he says it all in the
[19:35] verses it's not like a lot of commentary
[19:37] you can give to it but it's not going to
[19:39] stop me from trying for which of you
[19:41] intending to build a tower sth not down
[19:44] first and count at the cost whether he
[19:46] have sufficient to finish it this is a
[19:50] question that is rhetorical in nature
[19:53] assuming that
[19:55] nobody is going to start building
[19:57] something with without first knowing
[19:59] they have everything they need to build
[20:03] it otherwise they're going to start
[20:05] verse 29 let's happily after he had laid
[20:07] the foundation and he's not able to
[20:09] finish it in other words you can say oh
[20:12] well I've got X number of dollars here
[20:14] and I've got this much material said
[20:16] then you lay the foundation you didn't
[20:17] realize just how much work went into the
[20:19] foundation just how much can be poured
[20:22] into the cost of the slab just how much
[20:24] goes into the lumber and you get the you
[20:26] get the shell you get the beginning but
[20:28] then you don't have enough to finish it
[20:31] so he's actually kind of making the
[20:32] point that real wisdom before anything
[20:34] is undertaken slows down and says do I
[20:38] have sufficient not just to lay the
[20:40] foundation but to finish the
[20:42] superstructure and have it all finished
[20:45] he says otherwise people will begin to
[20:46] mock him saying this man began to build
[20:48] and was not able to finish it he was he
[20:52] wanted to build and he had some things
[20:53] to work with and he started and he laid
[20:55] did this good and he did that good and
[20:57] he had everything but he lacked La
[20:58] planning he lacked that discernment that
[21:01] Visionary aspect that foresight or that
[21:03] planning the preparation in other words
[21:05] Solomon went to build the temple Jesus
[21:08] is referring to man to build a tower and
[21:09] in the same way that Solomon built the
[21:11] temple and think of that the greatest
[21:13] thing we could think of maybe by way of
[21:14] physical structure the very identity of
[21:16] the Jews the temple the temple the
[21:18] temple the Temple mount the very center
[21:20] of Creation The Very Dwelling Place of
[21:22] God the way in which Solomon approached
[21:24] building the Temple is the same way you
[21:26] would approach building a simple Tower
[21:29] good you would think about it beforehand
[21:31] you say well what does it take I want to
[21:33] build a tower but I don't want it to be
[21:35] on Wheels I want to be able to have it
[21:36] the permanent location and this is
[21:38] what's going to take for the foundation
[21:39] this is what you're going to need for
[21:40] the
[21:42] superstructure I would even I would even
[21:44] argue that this is pretty good
[21:46] instruction for those who like to use
[21:47] Legos and Playmobile or building blocks
[21:50] whatever it might be I mean sit down and
[21:51] consider do this is what I want to build
[21:53] in my mind do I have sufficient to
[21:55] finish to build can I can I see in my my
[21:58] vision of what I want to build can I see
[22:00] where what kind of materials are going
[22:02] to be used in this and know that I have
[22:05] sufficient to finish it let me just
[22:08] remind you you can do all things through
[22:09] Christ that gives you
[22:11] strength now consider and so it says in
[22:14] First Kings chapter
[22:16] 6:7 and the house when it was building
[22:19] was built of stone made ready before it
[22:21] was brought thither so that there was
[22:24] neither Hammer nor axe nor any tool of
[22:26] iron heard in the house while it was in
[22:29] building this that's a mind-blowing
[22:32] scripture and uh too bad they can't
[22:35] figure this out for all the building
[22:36] projects that take place in our
[22:37] subdivisions like yeah can't they just
[22:39] get this all done ahead of time so I
[22:41] don't have to hear the beeping and the
[22:42] hammering and the drilling but they were
[22:44] actually able to Fashion the pieces that
[22:48] were needed and of these Stone and even
[22:52] it's the Timber and those things as you
[22:54] read in other places and actually this
[22:57] is maybe a good point to say this
[22:58] there's so many in uh different places
[23:01] that some of these things are mentioned
[23:02] in Scripture that there a a volume of
[23:04] things you could read in and the Kings
[23:06] and Chronicles and different places to
[23:08] see even in the Psalms there a lot that
[23:10] you can gather from about the building
[23:12] of the temple in the house of the Lord
[23:13] but it's say the stone was made ready
[23:15] there was not a hammer or an axe or a
[23:17] tool heard in the house while it was
[23:18] building it was all done
[23:21] beforehand and they didn't just go build
[23:23] a brick bring it lay it down and go okay
[23:25] let's build another one like this go
[23:26] build it and bring it it was as if they
[23:28] knew already what it was going to look
[23:30] like and how it was going to fit
[23:31] together and they did all the work
[23:33] beforehand and they were to bring it in
[23:34] and silently place it Brick by Brick
[23:37] Stone by
[23:38] Stone this was the wisdom that Solon
[23:41] exhibited in building the house of the
[23:43] Lord this was the planning that was
[23:45] required it wasn't well bless God I want
[23:47] to do this and I'm just going to try I'm
[23:48] just going to try and see what happens
[23:50] no there was uh there was wisdom that
[23:53] was
[23:54] exercised so let's consider the the
[23:56] vastness of this building
[23:59] construction and if you want to call it
[24:01] a project or um an undertaking and think
[24:05] of that again we're talking about
[24:07] building the house of the Lord so it's
[24:09] not just a tower it's not just a
[24:10] Grainery it's not you know an
[24:12] outbuilding this is the place that God
[24:14] would dwell in First Kings chap 6: 11
[24:18] to14 it gets more particularly as we've
[24:20] already read in uh these first 10 verses
[24:24] and maybe we could just track that a
[24:25] little bit how it was telling us the
[24:27] house of the Lord is going to be made of
[24:29] this length and this length and there's
[24:31] going to be out rooms and things round
[24:33] about it's quite a uh a campus I think
[24:37] the entire thing once it was finished
[24:40] covered like 17 Acres uh um not just the
[24:43] temple building but everything related
[24:45] to it and and as it began to build and
[24:47] grow there on the Temple Mount these
[24:50] things had to be interconnected they
[24:51] relied upon one another so it's a pretty
[24:53] vast project and as we're reading how
[24:55] that they they're building these
[24:57] Chambers and there's going to be a
[24:58] middle chamber it says in verse 11 and
[24:59] the word of the Lord came to Solomon
[25:01] saying concerning this house which Thou
[25:03] Art in building so this is in the in the
[25:05] time of its being built it's in this
[25:07] process if thou wil walk in my statutes
[25:10] and execute my judgments and keep all my
[25:12] Commandments to walk in them then I will
[25:15] perform my word with thee which I spake
[25:17] unto David thy father and I will dwell
[25:20] among the children of Israel and will
[25:22] not forsake My People Israel he was
[25:25] coming to that place in the building
[25:27] where now it's not just just going to be
[25:28] outer Court inner court but now it's
[25:30] going to be that most holy place the
[25:33] house within a house within a house the
[25:35] three room house however you want to
[25:36] look at three houses or three rooms
[25:38] those different ways that we looked at
[25:39] it in the very beginning of the year
[25:41] says if you will do this thing right and
[25:43] you'll walk before me this is where I'll
[25:45] dwell this place you're getting ready to
[25:47] build this holy of holies this Most Holy
[25:49] place I will come and dwell there and it
[25:51] says so Solomon built the house and
[25:53] finished it in reading these I find he
[25:56] built the house he built the house he
[25:57] built the house you find there's all
[25:58] these little houses that are all working
[26:00] together to make one great beautiful
[26:02] thing it's it it it's recounted here in
[26:05] 2 Chronicles chapter 3 I'll read verses
[26:07] 5 to
[26:09] 17 and the greater house this is the
[26:11] most holy h of holies this is that most
[26:13] holy place the holiest of holies now
[26:16] just think of how this room this house
[26:19] within a house is described and the
[26:22] greater house which Solomon built and
[26:23] finished the place that God said that he
[26:25] would dwell he sealed with fur tree
[26:28] which he overlaid with fine gold and set
[26:30] there on palm trees and chains this is a
[26:33] Wayne's coating this is wood paneling
[26:35] this is finishing it out just
[26:36] beautifully and he garnished the house
[26:38] with precious stones for Beauty and the
[26:41] gold was gold of paravan and he overlaid
[26:43] also the house the beams the post the
[26:45] walls thereof and the doors thereof with
[26:47] gold and Grave cherubims on the walls
[26:49] and he made the most holy house the link
[26:52] whereof was according to the breadth of
[26:53] the house 20 cubits and the bread
[26:55] thereof 20 cubits and he overlaid it so
[26:58] that perfect square and he overlaid it
[27:00] with fine gold amounting to 600 Talons
[27:03] and the weight of the nails was 50
[27:05] shekels of gold and he overlaid The
[27:07] upper chambers with gold and in the most
[27:09] holy house he made two cherums of image
[27:11] work and overlaid them with gold and the
[27:14] wings of the cherubs were 20 cubits long
[27:16] One Wing of one cherub was five cubits
[27:19] reaching to the wall of the house and
[27:20] the other was likewise five cubits
[27:22] reaching to the wing of the other chair
[27:24] now do you see how it's How much this is
[27:26] covering and how even big now how big
[27:29] the room is the square now these cherubs
[27:32] if you start doing the Matthew these
[27:33] things are touching out and reaching
[27:35] this whole thing and very vast says in
[27:38] verse 12 and One Wing of the Cherub was
[27:40] five cubits reaching the wall of the
[27:41] house the other Wing was five cubits
[27:43] joining to the wing of the other cherub
[27:45] the wings of these cherubims spread
[27:47] themselves forth 20 cubits and they
[27:49] stood on their feet and their faces were
[27:51] Inward and he made the veil of blue and
[27:53] purple and crimsom and fine linen and
[27:56] wrough the cherubims thereon and he made
[27:58] before the house two pillars 30 and five
[28:01] cubits High and a chaper that was on the
[28:03] top of each of them was five cubits and
[28:05] he made chains as in the Oracle and put
[28:07] them on the heads of the pillars and he
[28:09] made a hundred pomegranat and put them
[28:12] on the chains and he reared up the
[28:13] pillars before the temple one on the
[28:15] right hand and the other on the left and
[28:17] called the name of that on the right
[28:18] hand jashen and that the name of that on
[28:20] the left Boaz and other words it shall
[28:22] be established in his powers I think
[28:24] what those names are referring to and
[28:26] this is just some of the detail details
[28:29] of this one part of the house of the
[28:31] Lord the one specific chamber room and
[28:35] some of the the porch are associated
[28:36] with it some of the little uh building a
[28:38] little bit further out these are just
[28:39] some of the details of the construction
[28:42] and there's more details that you can
[28:43] come in here and begin to read in
[28:45] chapter 7 uh uh and over and over again
[28:48] all these different things that start to
[28:50] happen on this place where he's building
[28:52] and it just the breadth of the structure
[28:54] the details of it everything that's
[28:56] being thought out beforehand
[28:59] it says in First Kings chapter 6:38 and
[29:02] the 11th year in the month bull which is
[29:05] the 8th month was the house finished
[29:08] throughout all parts thereof and
[29:11] according to the fashion of it it's the
[29:14] original way it was envisioned and all
[29:16] the ways that it was to be done in order
[29:18] to be in service because one of the
[29:20] things that doesn't happen is they don't
[29:22] begin to offer Worship in there until
[29:23] it's done until it says the house was
[29:27] perfected so it was finished throughout
[29:29] all the parts according to the fashion
[29:31] of it the use of it what it was used for
[29:33] it wasn't one of these things and I know
[29:35] we do this sometimes in our natural
[29:37] lives where we we get we get it built so
[29:39] far then we move into it where you're
[29:41] able to do that certainly probably not
[29:43] anywhere around Phoenix or Maricopa
[29:45] County but uh if you lived out in Ohio
[29:48] somewhere I I knew people who built
[29:49] things and lived in their garage until
[29:50] they could finish the rest of it I'm not
[29:52] going to name names don't get nervous
[29:54] and and and that was just because you
[29:56] could do it and it was a great way to
[29:58] save some money and then there but it's
[30:00] say we won't we won't get our per we're
[30:02] not going to move in we're not going to
[30:03] do anything here until it's finished
[30:05] because that's the use of it we don't
[30:06] want to do anything halfway it's going
[30:08] to be established by his strength he has
[30:10] established it he has established it by
[30:12] his power these pillars all these
[30:14] details you can go through the colors
[30:15] you can go through the pomegranates The
[30:17] Palms the cherubims all these things
[30:19] pointing back to the T the Tabernacle of
[30:21] witness and the Wilderness back to the
[30:23] image that Moses saw in heaven how they
[30:25] all have some sort of representation and
[30:27] meaning all these details and all these
[30:29] things are finished it says so he was
[30:31] seven years in building it of course it
[30:33] was seven
[30:35] right seven years in building it so it's
[30:37] completion this Perfection of
[30:40] it now with again I know I'm I'm reading
[30:43] a lot of scriptures here so let's just
[30:46] think about all those details the
[30:48] breadth of it the weight of it I think
[30:51] well the
[30:53] foundation the foundation of this
[30:56] Temple what was going to be built on it
[30:58] and what would be uh what it would be
[31:00] supporting you read about all this gold
[31:04] all this material all this thought going
[31:07] into uh this Most Holy place and the
[31:10] porches of it it's pretty detailed would
[31:12] you agree from the beams to the post to
[31:14] the walls to the curtains to the pillars
[31:17] uh to the things above the pillars a 100
[31:19] pomegranates he puts on the chains just
[31:22] how detailed they'd have to be and the
[31:24] pillars and one on the right and left
[31:26] and he gives them even names and there's
[31:27] things on top the heads of the pillars
[31:29] this is a lot of detail so this is what
[31:32] you see this is the finished project
[31:34] project in all of its Grande but if you
[31:36] don't put that thing on the right kind
[31:38] of foundation these things won't
[31:41] last and I would like
[31:43] to again remind you think about our own
[31:46] lives think about our families think
[31:48] even about our church and and the kind
[31:50] of vision that we might have the goals
[31:52] well I want to accomplish this I want to
[31:53] accomplish that there may be some here
[31:55] that have a vision to be something when
[31:57] they get older go to school and do this
[31:59] and and it's always kind of off in the
[32:00] future I want to go to college and I
[32:02] want to get this degree and I want to do
[32:03] this or I want to become this I want to
[32:05] become that or I want to get married and
[32:06] I want to have children I want to all
[32:08] these V visions and dreams that we have
[32:10] all these Ambitions they're going to be
[32:12] built upon whatever you're doing right
[32:15] now your future is going to be built
[32:17] upon whatever it is you're doing right
[32:19] now and now that might cause a pure
[32:21] panic and some people to think where I'm
[32:23] standing right now is built on
[32:24] everything I've been doing for the last
[32:26] 49 years I need to get insurance I mean
[32:30] there and that's the truth iiz I'm the
[32:31] product today of things that have
[32:33] happened in my life and things that
[32:34] bring me to this moment but I think it's
[32:36] nice to know that if the Lord carries I
[32:38] can start doing things now with a vision
[32:41] with the heart to accomplish things for
[32:43] God say well then I may not be able to
[32:45] go to college now I may not be able to
[32:47] get that dream job but what can I do
[32:49] today what can I be doing today to meet
[32:53] that goal
[32:54] later kind of like uh what what they do
[32:57] University Michigan go Blue they have a
[32:59] thing like what are you doing today to
[33:01] beat Ohio State well whatever they've
[33:02] been doing the last few years is working
[33:05] and that's the kind of that's the way
[33:06] that they attack every day as football
[33:08] players what are you doing today not
[33:10] going to wait till the game right I had
[33:12] to bring Sports into to wake a few
[33:14] people up it's it's not waiting until
[33:17] the time comes I'm a football player
[33:19] well I'm this and I'm that I'm a man I'm
[33:20] gonna be a husband I'm I'm going to be a
[33:21] father I'm gonna be a leader I'm gonna
[33:23] be a preacher I'm gonna be this what are
[33:24] you doing today what are you doing today
[33:26] to make you get you in a place where God
[33:28] could use you later brother Braham talks
[33:31] about our Consecration and our
[33:32] surrendered life that hidden life so
[33:34] that you can find yourself welcome back
[33:36] brother Michael uh you could find
[33:37] yourself in a place where God knows
[33:39] where you are when he wants to use you
[33:42] so it's not so much just well I'm just
[33:44] going to wait till he wants to use me
[33:46] put yourself in position to be used he's
[33:48] going to be reaching for a tool so as a
[33:50] tool get in your place somebody goes to
[33:52] find you he's got the tool he needs to
[33:55] use and this is this is part of the idea
[33:58] that I'm wanting to present in the image
[34:00] of the foundation laying a good
[34:02] foundation what's going to be built in
[34:04] your lives what is it you're dreaming of
[34:06] what is it you're wanting to be used for
[34:08] what is it you're going to be
[34:09] supporting what's going to be in the
[34:11] future then that what you're doing today
[34:12] is supporting what's going to be in the
[34:14] future so the foundation of this Temple
[34:16] was important as much detail as we see
[34:19] here in 2 Chronicles 3 as much detail in
[34:21] chapter 5 and chapter 6 as much detail
[34:23] as we can glean out of the scriptures
[34:25] there there there's things that are said
[34:27] about the foundation
[34:28] that are so important to catch because
[34:30] everything else and its weight and its
[34:32] Grandeur and its beauty is all seted on
[34:34] something that might not even
[34:35] necessarily be
[34:37] seen in First Kings chap 5:
[34:40] 13 to 18 we stopped at verse 12 earlier
[34:45] Solomon's wisdom that God had given him
[34:47] was being manifested in the way that
[34:49] he's procuring the the Cedar and the fur
[34:51] says and King Solomon raised a levy out
[34:53] of all Israel we're going to read verse
[34:54] 13 to verse 18 and the levy was 30,000
[34:58] men and he sent them to Lebanon 10,000 a
[35:01] month by courses a month they were in
[35:03] Lebanon and two months at home and
[35:06] adoram was over the levy so here he's
[35:08] thinking I need to send laborers we need
[35:10] to we need to have rotation we're going
[35:11] to think through this we're going to be
[35:13] we're going to think about well how good
[35:14] would it be to send the men away for a
[35:15] long time and keep away from their wives
[35:17] and family so let's do rotations let's
[35:19] not burn anybody out Solomon had three
[35:21] score and 10,000 that bear burdens and
[35:23] four score thousand huers in the
[35:25] mountains beside the chief of Solon
[35:27] officer which was officers which were
[35:29] over the work 3,300 which ruled over the
[35:32] people that wrought in the work a lot of
[35:35] details here the labor force that's
[35:37] necessary now let's look at the
[35:39] foundation and the King commanded and
[35:41] they brought great Stones costly stones
[35:45] and huge stones to lay the foundation of
[35:49] the
[35:51] house and Solomon's Builders and Ham's
[35:53] Builders did Hue them and the stone
[35:55] quars so they prepared Timber and stones
[35:59] to build the house so when it came time
[36:02] to build the house he wasn't just
[36:04] getting good wood he wasn't just getting
[36:05] good gold he wasn't just getting good
[36:07] materials to furnish and finish it out
[36:09] and fur it out and make it all look real
[36:10] beautiful but he said I want to have
[36:13] great Stones as my
[36:16] Foundation they brought great stones and
[36:19] not just big but costly hu prepared
[36:23] beforehand just as it's prophesied of
[36:25] Christ I'm going to lay a foundation
[36:26] stone and four foundation stone it's
[36:28] going to be a precious stone it's going
[36:29] to be a tried Stone it's going to be a
[36:31] sure Stone it's the same thing here
[36:33] costly great
[36:35] hued things were shaped beforehand tried
[36:38] shaped carved out to be set in it and
[36:42] the Builders of Solomon and and heram
[36:45] and the the stone cores they prepared
[36:47] the timber they prepared the stones as
[36:48] we read later well beforehand to fit
[36:50] into the temple and the description of
[36:53] the foundation great costly cut
[36:58] shaped Stones that's how our foundation
[37:01] has to be great it's got to come with
[37:03] the price it's got to come with
[37:05] sacrifice shaping a cutting down and the
[37:09] sermon Fellowship by Redemption I didn't
[37:11] provide any of the quotations tonight on
[37:14] slides apologize just a lack of maybe
[37:17] energy and time today it says and I'm
[37:20] believing that the day that we're living
[37:22] now the most essential thing that I
[37:24] could think of any Minister speaking of
[37:26] is to get the people people back to the
[37:28] general principles of the Gospel coming
[37:30] back to a place coming back to bedrock
[37:33] to absolutes to things that we know are
[37:35] sure you are built upon the foundations
[37:37] of the Apostles and Prophets The Chief
[37:39] Cornerstone being Christ himself there's
[37:41] no other Foundation that can be laid
[37:43] than Jesus Christ so we got to come back
[37:45] to these things one of the most
[37:47] essential things that we could be
[37:48] preaching are the general principles of
[37:50] the Gospel that there could be a little
[37:52] bit of a temptation of saying well we we
[37:55] want to get into the deeper things and
[37:56] we want to get into the uh the the the
[37:58] real weigher things of the message of
[38:01] the hour and those things but those
[38:03] things are built upon the foundational
[38:06] things do you realize listen and I if I
[38:08] say this wrong forgive me and and give
[38:10] me a decade maybe to refine the way I'm
[38:12] saying it but do you realize 1963 from
[38:16] Seals post to 1965 is resting upon the
[38:19] foundation of
[38:20] 47-63 it's not like brother Bram just
[38:22] showed up and said now turn to
[38:23] Revelations chapter 5 like go ahead Mr
[38:26] brandham whoever you are young guy go
[38:28] ahead break break it down for me just
[38:31] the his entire life and his suffering
[38:33] and and his testimony up to the time
[38:35] that they start recording sermons we're
[38:37] where are we if we just start pushing
[38:39] play on God hiding himself in Simplicity
[38:42] it's built upon his entire Ministry and
[38:45] the Vindication and all those things
[38:46] tied together so that we're not just
[38:49] cherry-picking stories and testimonies
[38:50] and prayer lines we realizing that God
[38:53] laid a great foundation and did a lot to
[38:55] invest himself in this prophet's
[38:57] Ministry so that when it came to these
[38:59] great things that he would be breaking
[39:00] these great Revelations it would be
[39:02] built upon something
[39:05] else we'd have a foundation so brother
[39:08] say the most essential thing is this
[39:10] getting back to general principles of
[39:11] the Gospel in other words you need to
[39:13] know your ABCs to do your algebra for if
[39:16] you're not built upon the right
[39:18] foundation it's just it's no
[39:20] good what's the use of building upon a
[39:23] foundation that's already been
[39:26] condemned
[39:28] this takes some wisdom in our own lives
[39:30] to realize if we need to shape anything
[39:32] up and say well things aren't the way
[39:34] they should be in this home if things
[39:36] aren't the way they should be in my life
[39:37] and we go to just start remodeling our
[39:40] lives but we didn't recognize it was
[39:43] condemnation of the
[39:46] substructure it was calling out the
[39:48] foundation there might be some things
[39:50] you've built that are good but you tried
[39:53] to build them on the wrong kind of
[39:55] foundation she she says what's the use
[39:57] of building on something that's already
[39:58] condemned what would be the use of
[39:59] trying to paper and paint an old
[40:02] building that the government government
[40:04] had
[40:06] condemned paper and paint that might
[40:09] amount to what a lot of people do with
[40:10] their lives they try to paper and paint
[40:12] something that's already condemned and
[40:13] that's what many people are trying to do
[40:14] today by reforming trying to reform
[40:16] we'll start a church we'll turn a page
[40:18] we'll try to do a little different than
[40:19] what we used to do there's so many
[40:22] examples of this where even situations
[40:24] that don't quite work out whether it be
[40:26] in families what some people uh recently
[40:30] well I need to be very careful what I
[40:31] say here I won't even say it oh you
[40:35] should have heard it
[40:38] though but there's things that happen
[40:40] there's situations that transpire and
[40:42] people are upset with what it is and
[40:44] they go and they start something new and
[40:46] they just
[40:47] replicate what they left and they set
[40:50] themselves up to experience the same
[40:52] thing again because they they just tried
[40:55] to change the Optics and put a lot of
[40:56] paper pain and they didn't realize the
[40:59] foundation was wrong to begin
[41:01] with he says that they're just trying to
[41:04] reform just start a new church turn a
[41:06] page we'll try to do a little different
[41:08] than we used to do just a little
[41:09] different you'll never get nowhere like
[41:11] that it's just foolish to even try
[41:13] you're just only wasting time hope
[41:16] you're hearing this make it applicable
[41:18] what I'm reading in this sermon
[41:19] Fellowship by Redemption there were
[41:21] several part passages in here that were
[41:23] just speaking so specifically to
[41:25] foundations and I realized brother
[41:27] saying a lot that can be applied in a
[41:29] lot of different ways and and coming
[41:31] back to the gospel rebuke of
[41:32] denominations but I'm wanting us to
[41:34] glean from it this General principle of
[41:36] Foundations and beginning work and what
[41:38] things are resting upon and not just
[41:40] trying to paper and paint the the
[41:42] current Optics of something but asking
[41:43] myself is it on the right kind of
[41:45] Bedrock maybe you bought the paper and
[41:48] the paint and you're wanting to build
[41:49] later and you you're wanting to do
[41:50] something later and you're early on in
[41:51] your life recognize now before you ever
[41:54] start applying paper and paint what can
[41:56] I do now to be sure that I'm not wasting
[41:58] my time
[42:00] later it's foolish to even try you're
[42:02] only wasting your time you say well now
[42:04] I believe if we would just quit if I
[42:06] would just quit me li My Lying and me
[42:08] lying and stealing my lying and stealing
[42:10] and all the he says if that if I could
[42:12] just stop doing bad things my me
[42:14] interjecting there he says all those
[42:15] things as good as they are you're still
[42:17] a million miles off the
[42:19] road you've got to start back to the
[42:23] foundation you got to build a new place
[42:27] not patch up the old
[42:29] one build a brand new one you got to
[42:33] come back start right that's the reason
[42:36] you see so many faulty mistakes so many
[42:38] people indifferent people who profess
[42:42] Christianity now that might sound like a
[42:44] really harsh rebuke but it's actually
[42:46] just a beautiful correction the reason
[42:48] why we see mistakes indifference in
[42:51] people who profess to believe this
[42:53] message is because they didn't get on
[42:55] the right foundation
[42:57] to me in a lot of ways you could just
[42:59] extrapolate this out realize that's why
[43:00] a lot of people fall apart and a and
[43:03] their lives they backslide or they leave
[43:05] or they get bitter towards the message
[43:07] they didn't they weren't built on the
[43:08] right foundation and in many cases it's
[43:10] not necessarily their fault they were
[43:13] being taught and given things that
[43:15] weren't good for a foundation legalism
[43:18] the worship of a man uh culture politics
[43:22] Church identity uh uh a lot of lot of
[43:24] things to build well we're standing on
[43:26] this we're standing on this you just
[43:27] kicked that chair right from out of
[43:28] under him and their whole house of cards
[43:30] falls apart and like man I don't have
[43:31] anything to do with the message it's
[43:33] just theater it's just a house of cards
[43:35] it's just a bunch of hypocrisy and know
[43:37] they're actually right about what they
[43:39] experienced and they didn't have the
[43:41] right kind of foundation because a lot
[43:43] of other people experien the same blows
[43:45] and they notice their house of cards
[43:47] fall down but they realized they had
[43:48] good Bedrock they had good foundation
[43:51] but they had made the mistake of
[43:52] building the wrong things on it and they
[43:54] got down to base and they said you know
[43:56] what my identity in this Foundation this
[43:58] is a revelation not some sort of
[44:00] Fascination and I can't I can't change
[44:02] where I'm at but I got to build
[44:04] differently going
[44:06] forward you can't just you got to build
[44:08] a new place not just patch up the old
[44:10] one it speaks to us of the importance of
[44:13] laying a good
[44:15] foundation I have to confess I've been
[44:18] doing my best to preach a two-hour
[44:19] sermon lately and I can't even get to an
[44:22] hour and so tonight I'm just determined
[44:24] I actually just started adding stuff in
[44:26] later
[44:27] just asking chat GPT here's my sermon
[44:30] what would be good at the end for
[44:31] another 30 minutes and it just starts
[44:33] spitting a lot of good stuff out I'm
[44:35] just kidding I didn't do that I'm just
[44:37] vamping to get more
[44:39] time the importance of laying a good
[44:43] foundation it it's so
[44:45] necessary and as we've talked about the
[44:48] kingdom we've talked about the future
[44:49] home and we've looked a lot at the the
[44:51] things in the future a lot of those
[44:53] things over the last few years we've
[44:55] been looking at the beginning of things
[44:57] things and the end of things and that's
[44:58] just kind of how how we've been doing
[45:00] the overview but as we even look at the
[45:02] the New Jerusalem the city of
[45:05] God it's it speaks to how the importance
[45:08] of laying a good foundation Revelations
[45:10] CH 21:14 and the wall of the city had 12
[45:13] foundations and in them the names of the
[45:15] twel Apostles of the Lamb so it just
[45:17] didn't build a wall but had foundations
[45:19] for the wall there's so much that goes
[45:22] into things you you you may look at a
[45:24] straight wall and like oh I I I want a
[45:27] wall just like that and you go by the
[45:29] stone and you go by the brick and you
[45:31] and you buy everything that you see and
[45:34] then and then you begin to uh lay them
[45:37] try to lay them straight and make
[45:38] yourself a wall I'm willing to bet that
[45:42] that wall is going to look like talk
[45:44] about Serpentine right I mean this thing
[45:46] just weaving in and out and leaning this
[45:49] way leaning that way because it takes it
[45:52] takes a a Mason it takes someone who
[45:54] knows what they're doing to to build a
[45:56] wall and one of the things that happens
[45:59] first is well what's going to be holding
[46:01] up all this brick and is the ground
[46:04] strong enough how high is it going to be
[46:05] how much is it going to weigh it once it
[46:07] once it begins to settle is it going to
[46:09] stay
[46:10] upright so sometimes you may see a wall
[46:13] and you think wow okay so they used tin
[46:15] bricks and they did this and they did
[46:16] that and you don't realize that they had
[46:18] to dig six feet deep right lay down
[46:21] railroad ties and every 10 ft lay a dead
[46:23] man in there and dig it out to hold it
[46:25] all together and you never actually see
[46:26] see any of that but the rest of it's
[46:28] built on top of
[46:30] it and here you could see uh uh walls oh
[46:34] my look at these walls but what about
[46:35] their
[46:36] Foundation they had 12 foundations Verse
[46:39] 18 and the beginning the building of the
[46:40] wall of it was of Jasper and the city
[46:43] was pure gold like under Clear G GL
[46:46] glass and the foundations of the wall of
[46:49] the city were garnished with all manner
[46:51] of precious stones then this is not just
[46:54] the garnishing this is the Foundation
[46:58] the First Foundation was Jasper the
[47:00] second Sapphire the third calcy the
[47:02] fourth and emerald the fifth sardonix
[47:04] the sixth sardius the seventh chrysite
[47:07] the eighth Burl the ninth topaz the 10th
[47:09] choperas sis the the 11th ajacent the
[47:12] 12th and Amethyst these are these are
[47:15] the actual
[47:16] foundations it's not that they just kind
[47:18] of kind of hued a stone and said give me
[47:20] a sapphire dink isn't that nice to got a
[47:23] little no this is God and what I I love
[47:26] to just imagine is how that God when he
[47:28] created the heavens and the Earth like
[47:29] where are these materials coming from
[47:31] when he did in the beginning he laid
[47:33] certain things in the earth if he laid
[47:35] the Cornerstone in you before the
[47:36] foundation of the world he's laying the
[47:39] very Foundation of even the New
[47:41] Jerusalem when he begins to create you
[47:42] were there the city was there the stones
[47:44] were there the very wood of that tree
[47:48] that Christ would be crucified on he
[47:50] sewed into the Earth in creation and
[47:53] begin to grow trees knowing that one day
[47:54] a tree would come forth that the Savior
[47:56] would be hung on the very iron that made
[47:58] the nails that H that nailed him to the
[48:00] cross and fastened the Son of God to a
[48:02] cross as we begin to think about the res
[48:04] the crucifixion and Resurrection this
[48:06] week God put the ore in the earth when
[48:08] he created it man didn't mix that in a
[48:11] in in an ear he didn't have some sort of
[48:12] formula in Minecraft to be able to build
[48:14] you know uh to build nails to crucify
[48:17] the Messiah God put it in there in the
[48:21] beginning and each precious stone was
[48:23] not just an
[48:24] ornament but a pillar itself the
[48:26] Foundation itself of the
[48:29] walls this is the importance of laying a
[48:31] good foundation I am going to make maybe
[48:34] the risk pulling you right now
[48:36] individually but is this going all right
[48:38] Hunter am I doing is this okay do you
[48:40] approve just kind of some tur lips told
[48:43] you I was taking a risk especially
[48:44] asking a young guy like this he's like
[48:47] sorry bud but it I I trust it's going
[48:50] okay for you because it's very simple
[48:51] I'm just want you to think about what it
[48:53] takes to lay a foundation you want to
[48:55] have a good future what does it take
[48:56] have a good found what is it going to
[48:57] take a a good foundation yeah you want
[49:00] you want your family to go the right way
[49:02] good foundation you want your children
[49:03] to go in the way that they should go
[49:05] train them up in the way that they
[49:06] should go there's work that you put in
[49:08] in the
[49:09] beginning the this is the importance of
[49:11] laying a good foundation even in
[49:12] building his own house if you want to
[49:14] turn to First Kings chapter 7
[49:17] Solomon did the same thing with his own
[49:20] house the palace that would just be
[49:22] there next to the temple that's part of
[49:24] this great big huge complex that was
[49:26] being built it's got to have foundations
[49:28] that's got to have
[49:29] Bedrock First Kings 7: 1-12 I'm not
[49:33] going to try to preach two hours tonight
[49:34] I'm just trying to at least get to an
[49:36] hour says and all these were of costly
[49:39] Stones according to the measure of the
[49:42] hu of hug Stones I wanted to uh read
[49:45] more in this but in verse one but
[49:48] Solomon was building his own house 13
[49:50] years and he finished all of his house
[49:51] and he built the house of the forest of
[49:52] Lebanon and he begins to describe the
[49:54] length of it and the windows and the
[49:56] doors and the post and the porch and the
[49:58] pillars a a and the porch within and and
[50:00] then the house he built for Pharaoh's
[50:02] daughter there's so much that's being
[50:03] built here but now it says this is kind
[50:05] of the the foundation all these were of
[50:08] costly Stones according to the measures
[50:09] of HW Stones sawed with saws within and
[50:12] without even from the foundation unto
[50:14] the coping and so on the outside toward
[50:17] the great
[50:19] Court everything's costly
[50:22] expensive and the foundation was of
[50:24] costly Stones even great Stones he's not
[50:27] sparing any expense in the
[50:30] foundation if I could say this if you're
[50:32] going to skimp don't do it in the
[50:35] foundation don't go to build as they
[50:37] said that I think the temple around
[50:38] 2,700 square feet or something like that
[50:40] can't remember just what they say about
[50:42] that say well you know we're going to
[50:43] have gold and gold pomegranates and gold
[50:45] palms and gold chains and gold this and
[50:47] gold that and it's just going to be so
[50:50] rich and Majestic so we we since we're
[50:53] going to put a bunch of money in that
[50:54] why don't we just kind of sweep sweep
[50:56] The Rock off a little bit and just clear
[50:59] a patch no they had to go with costly
[51:02] Stones great Stones stones of 10 cubits
[51:04] and stones of eight cubits and above
[51:06] were costly stones after the measure of
[51:08] hug stones and Cedars and the great
[51:10] Court round about was with three rows of
[51:13] huge stones and a row of Cedar beams
[51:15] both for the inner Court of the house of
[51:16] the Lord and for the porch of the house
[51:19] and what are they all resting upon this
[51:22] costly strong
[51:25] Foundation Solomon laid a good
[51:27] foundation for the house of the Lord
[51:29] Solomon laid a good foundation for his
[51:31] house he laid the foundations of very
[51:35] deep in the
[51:37] ground he used hard durable Stones H uh
[51:42] stones that were Humane that could stand
[51:44] the pressure could stand the test in
[51:47] other words I I want to make a
[51:48] foundation that'll last that'll be
[51:51] there I remember when we built a house
[51:54] in Texas and we had to drill the these
[51:57] pillars these footings and they had to
[51:59] go like I can't remember how many feet
[52:01] over 20 feet maybe 30 feet there's like
[52:03] 18 of them or 20 of them and they had to
[52:06] drill them until they got to
[52:09] bedrock and and and Bally the engineer
[52:11] when they were done says well this whole
[52:13] area can get flooded and your house will
[52:14] just be standing on
[52:16] stilts because you you put enough in it
[52:18] you're like this house isn't going
[52:19] anywhere this this is not going to
[52:22] settle this is not going to shift at
[52:25] least that's what we told the buyers
[52:30] no but you use durable Stones they they
[52:33] had their own
[52:38] inspections stop the
[52:41] tape that the stones they used this was
[52:43] a part that I found remarkable as I was
[52:45] studying
[52:46] this they were to become part of the
[52:48] Earth
[52:50] itself no more the days of just a
[52:52] temporary Tabernacle in the wilderness
[52:55] but the foundation stone were to be
[52:57] United with the Earth itself so that the
[53:00] structure itself was United with the
[53:03] Earth in the
[53:06] base the the these pillars these
[53:09] structures upon that they became the
[53:12] basis the foundation the sheer
[53:14] foundation for the superstructure to be
[53:16] built the pillars as brother talks about
[53:18] them being the support of the
[53:21] superstructure and it to build I'm
[53:24] wanting to read a statement in close
[53:28] to build the foundation you had to take
[53:30] into
[53:31] consideration the complete the vastness
[53:34] of the temple itself for Solomon to
[53:36] build the right foundation he had to
[53:38] take into
[53:38] consideration what uh uh to build his
[53:41] house he had to take into consideration
[53:43] when he built the foundation for his
[53:44] house he had to know what he wanted his
[53:46] house to look
[53:47] like the temple was going to be grand it
[53:49] was going to be heavy it was going to
[53:52] be
[53:53] strong expensive of great imp
[53:56] importance and if it was going to house
[54:00] God that's where he was going to dwell
[54:03] he didn't want to cut Corners he didn't
[54:05] want to just build it any way the
[54:07] foundation had to be laid
[54:10] correctly I'm asking you what are you
[54:13] building what is it you want to look
[54:16] like what do you want to accomplish what
[54:17] do you want to succeed and I'm I I I'm
[54:19] wanting to challenge you with this
[54:21] thought of whatever you want your future
[54:23] to look like then you have to give
[54:26] thought to what you're doing today that
[54:29] that what it will be present then is
[54:32] built on your past which is now right
[54:35] and you got to know will it
[54:37] fit whether it be through indolence or
[54:40] Indulgence you just lay around and you
[54:42] don't do anything you're not trying hard
[54:43] you're not working well the product in
[54:45] the end is probably going to reflect the
[54:48] laziness the Indulgence and things of
[54:50] the world the lack of foresight the lack
[54:52] of care and concern as a family we are
[54:54] listening to a sermon this past week
[54:56] where brother bam says I think it's in
[54:58] the sermon job where brother bam talks
[55:00] about I'd like to use some of these
[55:01] statements maybe coming up brother bam
[55:03] says it's a shame that parents don't
[55:05] take interest in their children
[55:07] anymore they they're not thoughtful
[55:09] about the time that they're spending
[55:10] with other things they're not spending
[55:12] time with them they've been kind of
[55:14] lulled to sleep and so many things are
[55:15] happening not realizing before you know
[55:17] it it gets away from you and they're
[55:19] gone like what did I do what how did I
[55:22] did I did I prepare him for
[55:24] life so this Temple was important so
[55:27] what it rest upon was very
[55:30] important in the sermon Fellowship by
[55:32] Redemption brother bam again he's kind
[55:34] of connecting on the well I want to stop
[55:36] this I'm going to try this I'm G to try
[55:37] that I'm going to go to church and and
[55:39] all those things that we could try to do
[55:41] that's if I can say it's the paper and
[55:42] the paint but the question is what's it
[55:44] built
[55:45] on he says and these are fine all these
[55:48] other things are all right I have
[55:49] nothing against it but that's still not
[55:52] the
[55:53] basis don't build upon that alone
[55:56] intellectual Faith come back to the
[55:59] basis here get it in here and I would
[56:02] say that not being present I say that it
[56:04] doesn't it can't be intellectual here
[56:07] it's got to be a revelation here the
[56:09] Revelation is the rock the Revelation is
[56:11] the stone upon which you are built it's
[56:13] the stone upon which the church is built
[56:14] the Chief Cornerstone Christ is the
[56:17] revelation of Jesus Christ the new birth
[56:18] is the personal revelation of Jesus
[56:21] Christ to you you've got to be built on
[56:23] that it's something that we realize even
[56:26] in raising our own children we want to
[56:27] teach them we want to teach them in a
[56:29] way where they can have integrity and
[56:31] they can have character but if they're
[56:32] ever going to be real genuine Christians
[56:34] they've got to have an experience
[56:36] themselves he says you want to have have
[56:40] it inhere to fellowship with him to talk
[56:42] with him and then build on these other
[56:44] things bring these other things under
[56:47] that foundation so if you got to love
[56:49] these other things there that's great
[56:51] that's fine but really they don't work
[56:53] until they come back to the foundation
[56:55] they're designed for for man think about
[56:58] all these things that were going to be
[56:59] in the temple pomegranates Palms made of
[57:00] gold chains made of gold all these
[57:02] things all these really nice things if
[57:04] they just kind of set them up uh uh in
[57:06] some spot just set them up on the
[57:07] threshing floor of Ora if they would
[57:09] have had that there and be like oh okay
[57:10] this is Nate this is great all the same
[57:12] elements would not have been as
[57:14] functional and would have not been what
[57:16] God wanted and they could and and it
[57:18] would have been oh this thing's a mess
[57:19] but take the same things and put them on
[57:21] the right foundation like now that's
[57:23] that's what we're looking for I say that
[57:25] too especially to those of us here on a
[57:27] Wednesday night man I would say coming
[57:29] to church on a Wednesday night doesn't
[57:30] save you not even any indication that
[57:33] you are saved and a and it's not
[57:35] necessarily A should be a feather in
[57:36] your cap or something that you get
[57:38] puffed up about but doing this is a good
[57:42] brick this is a good brick this is a
[57:44] good uh element a resource this is a a
[57:48] great thing in your wall but you got to
[57:49] be sure that the foundation's there so
[57:52] that bricks like this fit together and
[57:53] Wednesday night after Wednesday night is
[57:55] Brick by Brick amen building something
[57:58] that'll
[58:00] last he says bring these other things on
[58:03] the right foundation but you're trying
[58:05] to bring these fundament fundamental
[58:07] truths upon a foundation that has
[58:09] nothing to do to it he says brother wood
[58:11] somewhere in the building is a
[58:13] contractor well what good it to him to
[58:16] take an old building that's worm eaten
[58:18] termites have eaten the building down
[58:19] and it's rotten to the foundation and go
[58:22] out and get some of the best Lumber that
[58:23] he could find good Dy season Redwood
[58:27] tack it on the house go out there and
[58:29] get paint That's recommended by the
[58:31] highest paint company in the
[58:34] world he said look at here preacher I
[58:37] can show you that this is the real
[58:38] genuine Redwood I'd say yes brother wood
[58:41] that's right now can you make this
[58:43] personal just this analogy he's using
[58:46] how is it applicable in our own lives
[58:47] where we're bragging about real good
[58:49] Redwood we're bragging about the best
[58:50] kind of paint but our foundation isn't
[58:53] right all the Optics and pretense
[58:55] sometimes that we can engage in his
[58:57] message Believers well brother Bram said
[58:59] it you know brother Bram said it say
[59:01] right here I can print it out for you
[59:03] well what what are you building all
[59:05] these quotes on what's the basis what do
[59:07] you want it to look like in the end you
[59:09] got the best paint you got the best
[59:10] Redwood you got all the best quotes he
[59:12] says he says but look at here here's the
[59:15] seal of approval that this is the best
[59:17] paint that could ever be put on a house
[59:19] that's right brother wood but your
[59:22] foundation is wrong it's got to come
[59:25] down
[59:27] wow you mean I can have all the best
[59:29] Redwood can have all the best paint I
[59:32] can have all the best um understandings
[59:34] of the message and I can have all the
[59:35] best quotations and scriptures and all
[59:37] these personal experiences and have all
[59:38] these things but if the foundation's not
[59:40] right the rest of it has to come down he
[59:43] said that's what's the matters we read
[59:44] earlier he said that's what's the matter
[59:45] with faulty mistakes and indifference in
[59:47] people who profess Christianity the
[59:49] foundation's not right he says your
[59:51] foundation's wrong it's got to come down
[59:52] everything you've been building up now
[59:54] let me caution this the Redwoods good
[59:56] maybe the paint job's good said but you
[59:58] got to bring it down and he says take
[1:00:00] all those things that you've built and
[1:00:01] put them on the right
[1:00:03] foundation that's what's the matter
[1:00:05] reading the scriptures right preaching
[1:00:06] the gospel is right but your
[1:00:07] foundation's wrong tear out your mental
[1:00:10] conception of things and get God In Your
[1:00:12] Heart by the shedding of the blood and
[1:00:14] then build from there your wood is all
[1:00:16] right if you've got it on the right
[1:00:18] foundation there you are I I I I know as
[1:00:21] I said earlier that the things he's
[1:00:23] saying has a very specific application
[1:00:24] in terms of even salvation and coming to
[1:00:27] the Bedrock of a the shed blood of
[1:00:29] Christ re washing the cner and being
[1:00:31] born again but it's a principle that we
[1:00:33] can apply over and over again as we go
[1:00:35] forward is this is today built upon the
[1:00:39] right foundation of yesterday and if
[1:00:41] yesterday wasn't the right foundation do
[1:00:43] today what you should have done
[1:00:45] yesterday so that the next day you can
[1:00:47] do what you were supposed to do with the
[1:00:49] right kind of foundation don't try to
[1:00:51] play catchup and get it all done today
[1:00:53] no get on the right kind of basis today
[1:00:57] it W's all right if you got the right
[1:00:58] foundation there you are just don't be
[1:01:00] angry with me now may cut a little bit
[1:01:02] but this is the truth this is what helps
[1:01:04] you go back to the right foundation to
[1:01:07] the
[1:01:08] fellowship oh it's beautiful encourage
[1:01:11] you to listen to that Fellowship by
[1:01:13] Redemption there's a number of number of
[1:01:15] other places I would have liked to have
[1:01:17] read different examples where brother
[1:01:19] bam talks about a
[1:01:20] foundation what's what it's built on but
[1:01:23] let me close with this Brothers you can
[1:01:25] come to your in
[1:01:26] instruments in Psalms
[1:01:29] 11: 3 and
[1:01:31] 4 it asks this question if the
[1:01:34] foundations be
[1:01:35] destroyed what can the righteous
[1:01:38] do the Lord is in his holy Temple the
[1:01:42] Lord's Throne is in heaven his eyes
[1:01:43] behold his eyelids try the children of
[1:01:46] men what an image to talk about the Lord
[1:01:49] in his holy Temple the throne which is
[1:01:50] in heaven and now we see this mirror on
[1:01:53] Earth the throne room the most holy
[1:01:56] place the greater house the Holy
[1:01:59] Temple the outer Court the inner Court
[1:02:02] the outer
[1:02:02] court all this all these things his eyes
[1:02:06] that do
[1:02:07] Behold The Children of Men to try them
[1:02:11] and the question is
[1:02:12] asked if you destroy the foundations
[1:02:16] what happens to the
[1:02:18] righteous again these foundations are
[1:02:20] not just
[1:02:22] physical it's not that all the righteous
[1:02:24] were kind of standing on a slab and if
[1:02:26] you destroyed that where would they go
[1:02:27] what would they do but it's the
[1:02:28] principles upon which something is
[1:02:31] built the laws by which something is
[1:02:35] governed I wonder sometimes I'll just
[1:02:37] say this to us as individuals I wonder
[1:02:39] sometimes if we don't start removing
[1:02:41] things from the message of the
[1:02:43] hour because we don't think it's
[1:02:46] essential and because the time that
[1:02:47] we're living in and we don't realize
[1:02:49] that we're kind of shedding away the
[1:02:51] foundation foundations of Holiness the
[1:02:54] foundations of decent see and abstaining
[1:02:56] from the things of the world the
[1:02:57] foundation of how a man ought to a man
[1:02:59] ought to look and a woman ought to look
[1:03:01] the foundation of our marriages and what
[1:03:03] they're built upon and just seems like
[1:03:04] anymore it's not uncommon to find this
[1:03:07] brother divorced that sister divorced
[1:03:08] them getting married together and and
[1:03:10] everybody acting like well I mean it's
[1:03:13] 2024 what do we
[1:03:15] do and we're not reminding ourselves you
[1:03:18] know what there's a there was a basis
[1:03:21] that we had that formed the foundation
[1:03:22] of this message and though people might
[1:03:24] find themselves in difficult situations
[1:03:26] they lose their way for a little while
[1:03:27] and things happen and I get it and I'm
[1:03:29] certainly not wanting to be condemning
[1:03:31] of any particular situation but let's
[1:03:33] not forget the Bedrock upon which we're
[1:03:36] built and think that we could just kind
[1:03:37] of kick out the whole thing and be a
[1:03:40] Capstone just a hovering Capstone like
[1:03:42] this is some sort of
[1:03:44] magic like a an unidentified flying
[1:03:47] object just hovering in Maricopa Valley
[1:03:50] but it's a pyramid it's perfect no it's
[1:03:53] got to rest upon a base Faith's final
[1:03:56] resting place is on the word of God it's
[1:03:58] got to have solid foundation if the
[1:04:00] foundation be destroyed what's going to
[1:04:05] last the principles that were built upon
[1:04:08] the laws by which something is governed
[1:04:11] whether we say the principles of
[1:04:12] vindication and the
[1:04:14] prophit the the the very things that
[1:04:16] we're built upon the very things that H
[1:04:18] have got us to where we are today in a
[1:04:20] positive sense if the the the scripture
[1:04:22] here the foundations be destroyed it's a
[1:04:24] lot that's being alluded to in in the
[1:04:25] psalm but it said if the foundations of
[1:04:28] what's good and right the foundations of
[1:04:30] order and the law and Justice is
[1:04:32] destroyed what will
[1:04:35] last this kingdom is built upon
[1:04:37] principles this kingdom was built upon
[1:04:39] an order and and the word of God and a
[1:04:41] certain attitude towards righteousness I
[1:04:44] if you get rid of that it's Lawless it's
[1:04:47] chaos nothing will succeed and what does
[1:04:50] it say if the foundation be destroyed
[1:04:53] and I express this to all of us if you
[1:04:55] got a good foundation if you lose lose
[1:04:58] that what's going to how how can you
[1:05:00] last and if things are teetering and
[1:05:03] things are being shaking and you realize
[1:05:04] man I haven't been putting in the work I
[1:05:06] don't have a foundation lay for yourself
[1:05:09] a foundation a pattern of good works the
[1:05:11] scripture says this is it becomes part
[1:05:13] of your foundation start doing things
[1:05:15] right now right now amen start doing
[1:05:19] things right right
[1:05:20] now there's are things that we can do
[1:05:23] and I I want to convey in a way that
[1:05:24] delivers a lot of gra to say to not
[1:05:27] think man I've been married so many
[1:05:29] years I've been raising my children so
[1:05:30] many years I've been in the messes so
[1:05:31] many years and you look back and it's
[1:05:32] chaotic and it's not a good foundation
[1:05:34] you've got mixed up in this you got
[1:05:35] mixed up in that you might feel where
[1:05:37] you are now you're just completely
[1:05:38] starting all over you don't have
[1:05:40] anything it's charred ruins it's like
[1:05:43] brother bradam says it's all termite
[1:05:45] eaten tore down and and God's not saying
[1:05:49] yeah it's all
[1:05:50] condemned just give
[1:05:53] up he's saying if I could put this way
[1:05:57] and and I'm glad he's maybe not as cruel
[1:05:59] as we can be sometimes but he'd say
[1:06:01] wellow I mean what what did you expect
[1:06:04] Aaron you weren't building where I told
[1:06:06] you to
[1:06:07] build yeah you had a lot of good Redwood
[1:06:09] you had a lot of good paint but you got
[1:06:11] to build on the foundation and if you'll
[1:06:14] just build on the foundation it'll come
[1:06:16] up right and it's not too
[1:06:19] late to make sure our foundation is
[1:06:22] right brother Ram even in his own
[1:06:24] Ministry
[1:06:26] come off the field was coming to the end
[1:06:28] of the year he was going to quit
[1:06:30] preaching he was going to go get his old
[1:06:31] job back and he's like I'm a
[1:06:33] failure told his family I'm going to
[1:06:35] quit preaching I'm go see my old boss I
[1:06:37] want to get my the job I used to have
[1:06:38] back I'm not going to preach anymore and
[1:06:40] he laid in bed that night feeling like a
[1:06:43] failure like I've blown it the Miracles
[1:06:46] the signs and wonders here he is after
[1:06:48] all these years almost 30 years of just
[1:06:52] Dynamic Miracles and around the world so
[1:06:55] so many times and now he goes back to
[1:06:56] Jeffersonville little house of nobody
[1:06:59] and he's going to
[1:07:00] quit he lays in bed that night thinking
[1:07:03] about what the next year is going to
[1:07:04] hold he's like yeah I'm going to be back
[1:07:05] just in the
[1:07:06] workforce felt like a failure what was
[1:07:09] it all for what did it all amount to
[1:07:12] it's as if as if it was all for not and
[1:07:15] God gives them a
[1:07:17] vision three different
[1:07:19] parts culminating in a cathedral like
[1:07:23] Tabernacle Temple the vision we call
[1:07:26] maybe the tent Vision it was going to be
[1:07:29] the crowning the culmination the climax
[1:07:30] of his
[1:07:32] ministry and nothing was
[1:07:34] wasted God promises he'll use all things
[1:07:39] and to think that some of your garbage
[1:07:40] and some of your mistakes and some of
[1:07:42] the things you've done you might feel
[1:07:44] like I've made a mess God looks at it he
[1:07:46] says I can make that a
