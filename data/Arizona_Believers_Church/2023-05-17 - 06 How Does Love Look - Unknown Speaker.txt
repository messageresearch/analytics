TRANSCRIPT
========================================
title tonight might seem when you look at it a little bit grammatically clumsy but it is deliberately phrased that way but it's how does love look and you admit maybe it sounds like a little bit slangy or maybe not exactly how you'd say it but how does love look and phrased it this way kind of just struck me a little bit different angle this morning just to title what I'd been working on differently and we're maybe not going to take time to review the other parts that we've been in thus far because I think each one of these can stand on their own but they certainly build into a very beautiful picture but what we are doing in looking at perfect love is addressing those things that hinder us from fully receiving perfect love and then in turn and maybe by consequence if we can't fully receive perfect love then we certainly can't fully Express perfect love or we have a difficult time expressing perfect love so if you want to jot down this title I think you'll find that there's a lot of ways that this is going to unfold to us but we're looking at the title is how does love look now as we've red already in this how bringing that comparison between slay Cain who slew his brother and then us who ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren it says in John chapter 15 verses 12 and 13 He says this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved Jews so he kind of he inches us towards it's not just having feelings for one another and saying I love you but it can manifest itself in the same way that as I have loved you and that love caused him to sanctify himself for other sake it compelled him to do things for their sake and love drove him to do things oh well as Christ loved me I ought to love others likewise so that's kind of the standard he raises but then he says greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends so He suggests not just a high standard but maybe the highest standard this is not just a great love but it's the greatest love is he calls it a greater love and he's pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of laying down our life lives and we could look at this in the sense that it refers to a life of living for others so this is eternal life is living for others and I think we could probably do some mathematics to say that Zoe life or God's own life is eternal life and then say that God is love and then kind of do the math and so eternal life is love and eternal life is living for others so perfect love is living for others and I think that's scripturally correct it'd be correct according to the word and so it refers to living for others and having a life of service but I I'll be honest I studied this from the standpoint of is there any way at all that we could break these words down and shoehorn in any other definition or meaning to suggest that we wouldn't he's not talking about literally laying down your life but it is he is speaking of the culmination of death and so not just service but actual sacrifice and giving of himself he says in John chapter 10 verse 11 I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep so Christ says love one another as I have loved you and greater love nobody has any greater love than this and this is the greatest love that a man laid down his life for his friends so and he's speaking of his own not just service but sacrifice of himself for us and for our the Forgiveness of our sins so when John says in First John 3 16 I believe he's carrying forward these things that Christ taught and he says hereby perceive we the love of God I believe last Wednesday we said he's talking about trying to figure out God's love and what it looks like and how we can kind of grasp and catch oh he must love me because he did something for me he says hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us so there's a there's a thought that I want you to hold in mind but then he says and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren so we know and understand the love of God and that he acted according to that love he gave himself he sacrificed his life for us and then he takes it a step further and says and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren now um I think there's it begs certain questions and I'll qualify this because I'm not so much wanting to get him maybe into the specifics and details of this but we cannot physically die to redeem somebody else we understand that when he says that we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren that we cannot say oh I'll die so that my son can be saved or I'm willing to die so that um so that they can receive eternal life that sacrifice has already been done it's not necessary that any one of us would need to give our lives physically in order to redeem someone so when he says that we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren I feel like we could say what does that even mean right what does it mean I got to lay down my life for the Brethren and then even it kind of carrying back to even the Genesis of it as Christ taught the disciples how do I love others as Christ loved them and we look at Christ and say well here he was he was sinless he was born with the nature of God inside of him had a perfect relationship with the father and uh it must have been easy for him to love or it must have been so clear that he could look out upon others and say well I know you gave me the leaven and this one is of the wicked one and and he could just look at everything the right way maybe know the end from the beginning and we might think well just made it easier on him so we think well then how is it that I can love as Christ's love and and again we're just asking the question I know you're jotting this down saying all right great we're going to get answers tonight but I think it's just good to stimulate thought and and get a lot of questions out there and make us desperate for answers and go to him whom as who has the answers the Lord but I think it kind of moves into that territory where I believe that we're all sincere tonight and if we could speak to the children and maybe just a hinting that kids eat free is that I think children ought to be desired to be to love their parents more correctly and show them honor and to obey them and do as the scripture tells them but maybe it's more applicable to us as believers who are filled with the Holy Ghost and serving God is if I'm to love others as Christ loved them how is it that I can be Christ to my spouse how can I be Christ to my family how can I be Christ to my neighbor and if I'm to love my neighbor as myself how do I love myself correctly to in turn love my neighbors correctly and it really does kind of open up a whole area of thought to say I know I want to be christ-like I know I want to be the love of God extended in his hands and his eyes and his feet but what does that even look like I mean if we're if we're driven by the scripture and even it's just it's letter it's black lettering on white paper that well if someone sees their brother and in need and I shut up the bowels of compassion uh then how can the love of God dwell in me does that compel me then whenever I see a need that I've somehow got to fulfill it and do it just because the needs there I got to fulfill it and if I don't him I somehow uh bankrupt of the love of God and we'd say these are good questions could you please answer them in the next 45 minutes right and I would say that we have to look at the love of God to understand what the love of God is instead of just grasping a hold of the letter and trying to carnally fulfill it thinking that in doing so we have the love of God or that we're fulfilling his love and so I think it begins by again by the kind of the track that we've been on to the first five services in that if we do not perceive God's love correctly then we can never manifest his love correctly if there's any anything that interrupts our perception of it that if we in turn try to express it and we try to express a perverted uh understanding then we're going to get similar results and if I don't understand his love for me and I'm in turn with the misunderstanding trying to express the Misunderstood love then my love isn't going to be projected correctly what I'm projecting isn't going to match the image of God's true love and so we're maybe the question could be what does love look like and so we need to see it correctly in order to express it correctly and I will uh I'll say this just by the very very remote chance that anyone in the smallest of ways remembers a sermon that I preached over a year and a half ago on barriers and boundaries and on love has limits and go ahead and say that again a little bit louder okay this is great all right we're just going to relax tonight but or maybe I should get nervous that you remember it that well but on I love having limits I believe it's Part Parts eight and nine of the series on berries and boundaries and so and I've looked back through the things we've ministered in the last couple years and see that there's a lot I'm repeating a lot of things we've already covered and we're uh we're revisiting some common themes but I'm hoping tonight that by grabbing a hold of things that we've already taught on and that you know very very well even prior to when we taught on it that we can actually gain better perspective of these things because I'm I'm not afraid to keep just preaching the same thing over and over again because really at the end of the day this could just be titled Jesus Christ part 243. right and we could just call it that and so we know that we're preaching the word over and over we're faithful we want to be faithful to the nature of Christ when we preach so I'm not really afraid of repeating the same thing over and over again uh I remember a friend of mine brother Mike Price one time as uh we were talking about preach I don't know if I was even preaching at the time but um I was visiting or traveling with him when he was preaching and I said Do you ever write down what you preach because he preached a different place three or four times a week and he goes no I never write it down I go what if you end up preaching the same thing twice and he goes well if God led me to preach it the first time and I go by that the second time then God that's my excuse as God just led me to do it and I was like well that's really really good so I I was didn't make a habit of writing things down and just being a young preacher I mean when I finally started preaching I preached something at my home Church there in Texas at the time and after it was all over with the brother was standing outside he goes yeah brother Aaron I really enjoyed that service and it was good when you preached it a few months ago he said but you guys it was good again I really enjoyed it is that the moment was like oh I just preached the same thing a few months later so if I'm doing that at least I'm very much self-aware tonight that I hope that in looking at it again we're able to get a little bit deeper into it because I believe we should not Tire of hearing the truth as long as it's inspired and it's in season and so I will be covering a lot not necessarily length but there's a lot that I'm going to be covering I think it's going to be real heavy real Heavy Deep stuff that we're covering and I know that you've heard it before but I'm hoping that in being able to repeat these things it makes a deeper impact and that we could just make a little bit more relevant emphasis maybe emphasize a little bit different angle as we look into this and so the love of God and and I I would say the love God's love that he has for us and even our love for God is not always in the image that we would expect it to be in even if we borrowed from trying to do God of service without it being his will we might think oh well if I love God this is what I do this is what I would do and God would say that might look extravagant to the world but I don't that means nothing to me and so we know that there's a certain way that we may try to love God that he cannot receive because it's not his will and then also the love that he has for us is not always in the image of what we would expect so it's kind of how love looks and in first John chapter 4 verse 16 he says and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us so when he says we have known and believed the love that God hath to us it's essential to know his love and to trust his love and John just says it so absolute and kind of an assumptive way and I think that it's okay for us to revisit this and say I want to know it more I need to trust it more and this be kind of instructive to us and so he's saying we had known and believed the love that God had to us and I'll say that this true love that he's talking about is tied to knowledge and experience that for us just to say oh I know God's love could just just mean that we've heard about it or we have some knowledge but it's important that we experience it that we that we know it by experience and not just knowledge so I think that's true faith is John's teaching it is knowledge and experience he goes we have known and believed the love that God had to us God is love and he that dwelleth in in love dwelleth in God and God in him now in verse 80 also says God is love so this is something that he has repeated twice in the same chapter God is love now if I can say this God having many different attributes and many different characteristics that the way that he's saying it and we're drawing this from other scriptures that this is kind of the crowning reigning attribute of God this would be like the Capstone as it's described in the Statue of a perfect man this charity that resides on the capping of a perfect man this is God's reigning attribute it's one of those uh it's it's a sense the essence of his divine nature this attribute of love so God is love and I think we've mentioned this before but not all love is God because you say that when it says God is love we have to be careful to say it's not that God equals love because we said God equals love then whenever we see what we think to be loved we say oh well that's god well that's not true God is love but you can't necessarily invert it whenever I look at something like that the the the example I like to use is all lafontaines are singers right but not all singers are LA fontaines and that to me we can all just immediately yeah I get that I perfectly understand that and so we can see that what one thing may be true of God that God is love but then we can't just try to invert that say well God equals love and wherever we see love that's God no you kind of have to tap the brakes because not all love is God so it can't just be perfectly inverted that I think how we could read this I hope that reading this in a way to not breaking any new ground with you but I think this is the way that I like to share it because it's helped me through the years to understand love he says God is love whatever God is whatever God does whatever God says that is perfect love that God God cannot and I'm going to just keep hammering this home God cannot do something like well that's not love whatever he does is love because God is love so it's something that true love this true love it's a pure love it's a it's without hypocrisy that there's times when maybe we we we try to express love and we realize well I I love this is love but is it was it really truly love in the end or what was it well that's this is done in such a way he says that's not love that's anger that's frustration that's fear that's doubt and maybe it's kind of hid behind this this covering of Love With God whatever God says whatever he does that is love we could accept it as such God who is love and this God who is Charity he is in the Bible he is light he is fire he has Mercy he is jealousy he is gracious he's referred to as Holiness and righteousness there's all different ways that we could characterize God even we say God is love but God is a light God is a fire there's a lot of ways we can describe him and so if we I would put it this way as it says God is love he said this is one of those some is this this umbrella attributes and one of these tying reigning themes when it comes to love God that this is something that is it at the essence inherit in all his other attributes or this this fact that he is love is kind of what SEALs the Perfection of all other attributes so God could be a jealous God but if he wasn't love that jealousy could be perverted so there's different ways you can look at realize there's something that is sealing this that love is so essential to his nature and his character and if we broke it up as God is light God is jealousy God is righteous God is Holiness or God is this rainbow of different attributes I all of God's characteristics every single one of his attributes harmonize with all the other attributes so a singular attribute of God must harmonize with all the other attributes of God there can't be one that's Out Of Tune there's not an outlier where God is love and God is this and God is that and then all of a sudden well and God does this which is really a complete opposite of all his other attributes and characteristics it doesn't work that way every single expression or manifestation will harmonize with all the other expressions and manifestations and will contribute to the understanding or the working out of all those other attributes in other words they're never at odds God's love will never compete with if you say he's a jealous God a loving God cannot compete with his the the his other nature of being jealous a God of Justice cannot compete with the god of righteousness there's I guess just used a word that's exactly the same in the Old Testament so I just stated the obvious but God cannot work in any way to have some sort of manifestation that is at odds with or competes with any of his other attributes I would say therefore as his attributes we should not compete with one another but as we've looked at Divine love and I think let me just refer back to something we've said before that we say that agape love is God's love and uh filial love is human love now we're not wanting to be super strict in that and doctly strict to where we just stay with those Greek words to understand love but we use those to understand the truth that there is a love of God there is a true love of God and that love when we use Agape it speaks of a love of a higher intelligence so perfect love is a love of a Divine intelligence it is a love that's attached to purpose it's a love that's attached to reason and an expected end and just as we know that God's ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts and his ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our ways then there's a love Which is higher than our love and there's a love that's um that's not like our love and it is that love of God is perfect love in First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 5 5 this is a Chapter 13 of First Corinthians would be a very obvious place to spend a lot of time in it says love speaking of Charity doth not behave itself unseemly I'd like to come back to that but look at these three other attributes seeketh not our own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil I think when we looked at this before we saw what love is what it isn't what it does what it doesn't that you could just see this as you read through First Corinthians this is what it is this is what it isn't this is what it does and this is what it doesn't and it kind of tells us the limits to love and how it operates within certain things and so and it says that it seeketh not her own there's a lot that we could spend on this but I'm just mentioning it as this is part of part of the attributes and characteristics of God's love or Divine love or charity it's selfless it does not seek does not act solely for its own benefit or for its own advantage or its own gain so it's not going to say well love love acts in a way to where it's like I can benefit from this so I'm going to do it it's not merely interested in self so love this is going to be a challenge to our female love our human love love does not seek to gratify its own want and is not solely interested in its own happiness now I could say that love will act in interest of its joy and love will act and interest of its desire but that's not the sole thing it wants to achieve is like I know I'd be the worst thing for you but I want you right it's it's an understanding of what is best and what is proper when it says it's not easily provoked it's not easily irritated or angered so it's speaking kind of back to its long suffering and those attributes of it then it says think of No Evil and I wanted just to throw this in there as I feel that I'm sensing I'm running out a little bit of time tonight but when it says it think of No Evil it fully forgives just freely it's free to forgive it fully forgives instead of imputing evil against Defenders so when I have been offended against when it says love pure love or perfect love thinketh no evil it's when if I'm operating in this kind of love this charity this Agape when it says it thinks no evil it's referring to thoughts of forgiveness and that I don't I'm not just oh you did this to me I'm imputing evil to you but it just has this Liberty to forgive but Abraham mentioned it on Sunday I believe we're Stephen uh even in the moment that he's crying out I said don't lay this to their charge I mean what what beautiful words in the face of anger in an unrighteous judgment on their part and it's akin to the love that Christ expects on the cross father forgive them for they know what not what they do that's that that's charity operating where it's not seeking evil in the face of evil being done to you so and and hope you're paying attention but when love is operating and it says it seeketh it thinketh no evil it doesn't kind of mull on retribution it's not meditating on Revenge or contriving evil against others and while he did this to me then this is what I want to do to him and so it's not in that it's free from that and it's forgiven and I realize to me how much this connects with the love of God because to do that as Mortals we're really trusting the Lord because the part of us that wants to hold on to an offense hoping that it's addressed and that the person pays and gets what they're due for it but when we can just let go of it then we're trusting the Lord that he's the judge that that God who sees all things and knows all things that he'll be the one that that'll see that uh it what is done what is right and what is just will be done now as we back up to do not doth not behave itself unseemly the word that's used there is it means not Unbecoming or unfitting in other words Love Is Never inappropriate and it comes from the word which means indecent or deformed and that to me was really striking and it's it's used of a word that is related to schema and kind of the alternate form of the words as they're kind of related and worked together it's kind of fashion and it's that which comprises everything in a person which strikes the senses the figure the bearing the discourse the actions and manner of Life the habitus and so when love behaves itself does not behave itself inappropriately in other words it'll it never acts out of character of its image that if if love is a certain way you don't all of a sudden see these outliers you don't see that that love has two arms and ten fingers and and this is love but then all of a sudden it kind of grows this other gnarly arm it's like love just won't do that because it does not behave itself unseemly it's not inappropriate it'll never act outside of what is right and appropriate for it so Christ or we say charity which is God or Christ never acts out of character so when God acts when he speaks or Acts and let's say in truth God speaks or he acts that if we perceive it as evil then we've misunderstood it or if anything supposes to be God an action or word but it is evil then it's not because God cannot there's no way that he can ever act in a way that's inappropriate and outside of his character and outside his fashion so when it says charity does not behave itself unseemly that perfect love is always right perfect love is always correct in Romans chapter 13 verse 10 love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law I think it's remarkable when we look in the what sums up all the law and the prophets and how all the law and everything hangs on his Commandments to love the Lord thy God with everything and thy neighbor as thyself he said this is what fulfills the law because there's something incredible about loving God perfectly and then being able to love others like that and listen that if you do that then you're God you're Godlike like you've you've fulfilled the purpose of the law and I think they should speak to us a lot of what God's trying to accomplish but says love works no ill to his neighbor and I think this fits right back in the verse 5 of chapter 13 of First Corinthians therefore love is the fulfilling of the law that that last part I want just to hang over this as we read this but love worketh no ill it's not capable of working evil against somebody else it's not evil of figuring conspiring and contriving evil against your neighbor it can't do it so if you commit evil against your neighbor unto the guise or pretense of love right it's not no matter how much you claim well love is corrective and you'll sometimes love hurts and we believe in tough love around here and no matter how much you say it if it is evil if it works ill to the neighbor then it's not it's not love love can never defraud love never works through deceit love will never injure love is never never works in a way that's selfish or jealous and in a negative sense and so there is uh there is nothing that you can do Under the pretense of love that would defraud or deceive or injure somebody because love works no ill to his neighbor the Jews have a saying there is no service like the love of God because it's pure and so there can be if this is what true love is or perfect love there can be no evil motive that we attribute to God's love that oh he only did this because and there's some sort of nefariousness or some wickedness there or we can't attribute any kind of wicked objective so his motive and objective is always right it's not selfish it's not self-serving and can we not admit that as humans there's times when our love and the things we do to express love there's maybe something we want back in doing it maybe it's not always pure unselfish and so if I could say this I might maybe just going to hit these scriptures very quickly and just move on but because love Works no ill to his neighbor and love love never acts out of character of God's nature and his his manner of life or all his other essential attributes love will never withhold a good thing it gives what is proper if something good is due love gives it now we sometimes wrestle as humans in our love where maybe we withhold a good thing maybe maybe there's something we're a little bit reluctant and this is where we're drawing a lot on these complexes uh that that complicate God's love and we're thinking oh well this and that and I want to be a little bit selfish I need to be guarded I need to be a little bit sure but love will not withhold a good thing nor will it ever give an evil thing it's always proper it's always appropriate it's always just first Thessalonians 5 15 see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men and though there's it maybe leaves a lot to be desired in that what does it mean to fall after charity what does it mean to follow good with all men and to ourselves and to one another what is that what does that look like and that's kind of the question we're asking but it's at least saying that we should never rindle evil for evil because that's not right to when someone has done evil to you and you render it back that's not love so he says that we should follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men that we that's that's our objective as Christians because that is Christ as we read this in First Peter chapter 3 verses 8 9 10 and 11. I think it kind of just speaks to this theme and maybe we won't spend a lot of time amplifying it but it will it'll definitely um kind of Target some things that are very very relevant in this finally be you all of One mind having compassion one of Another Love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous some of us may not have a hard time being pitiful but some of these other things we may need to really work at but of one mind having compassion love his brother be pitiful kind of merciful be courteous these are attributes that we ought to Aspire to not always being that you know I'm I'm strict and I'm serious and you know this this word you know it's it's it's the Rapture and bust and we we kind of all use it as just a means to be mean to people and we're using well it's the word of God isn't it right and we and we try to do as the thieves did to the uh the the man on the on his way to Jericho that we just Rob him and beat them and take everything away from and we don't care that they're clothed we don't care that they're wounded well the word of God is sharp you mess with it you're going to bleed a little bit and so there's a little bit of way we're justifying these things but it's kind of saying having compassion one of Another Love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous um I took the scripture out and I realized now just maybe how necessary it was but I mentioned it before in Luke where he says if any man doesn't hate right then he's not worthy to be my disciple the the hard sayings of Christ are only pure to those who find them hard right in other words if he says to hate and you're like yes yes right I hate them with the perfect hatred yes favorite scripture and some of you could probably quote it right because it's your password whatever Psalm that is Boom hashtag dollar sign this is it and perfect spelled p three right and you got it you just perfect hatred as your password some of you get nervous and if that's easy then it's not pure if it's if it's and so I think I think I kind of mentioned that because it doesn't spill over to this other side oh we're just compassionate and we just love man love is not what you think it is but you have to have compassion you have to love his brother and be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing well if you're going to talk about me I'll talk about you but contrary rise blessing do good unto those who use you and and just and harm you knowing that you're there and too cold that you should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days I think that's good do we want to love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that speak no guile let him assure evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it these these virtues are are no longer in the conscience of modern day Christians they're not they're completely perverted and if they're not completely perverted they're repudiated and they and they they I think the comparison is they wanted Jesus who's more like John Wayne than the Jesus that actually was Jesus and so they these are things that are very uh applicable to love and the expression of love and how that I ought to have a heart for other people and having love and compassion and not rendering evil for evil because love's not going to give evil back when evil has been given so what perfect love does is it pursues righteousness this is the good and not speaking evil and not and speaking no guile a shoe evil do good seek peace and Sue it these are things saying that love pursues righteousness it's always going to act to promote truth it's always going to act because it wants to fulfill God's perfect will now do you hear that love is always going to act to promote God's perfect will now that right there is a great moderator of behavior now it might appear cruel it might hurt it might even offend it could even be called in some ways uh offensive and harmful in demeaning and derogatory it might be a lot of ways a lot of language that the world would use for things that are in fact righteousness but that's only the human instinct that's only the human understanding that's the human view that's what human love looks like and that's how it looks to us and that's how human love use things so whenever we see something a certain way we may shrink back I'm like oh that's awful could could we not make the argument that how could love demand the sacrifice of one son and so just upon that basis alone we could realize that the love of God could look very messy it can look very hard it could look very cruel it can be offensive it might not comport with all our ideas of sensitivity and fairness and Equity but yet God's word is always right and his love will always line up with his word now because of this the the fact that I hope I'm hope I've been able to with these scriptures present that love perfect love acts within the character of God and that it is and that we all likewise want to act within the character of God but from someone else's vantage point the way that God's character is expressed the way love is expressed it's it doesn't always wash over it says now that's love right like we don't always recognize it that way in Revelations chapter 2 verse 9 this is the scripture that brother Branham is drawing from when he goes on a very lengthy writing in the smyrnian church age chapter for the church age book about God's love and perceiving God's love he's taken it from this phrase Revelations chapter 2 verse 9. I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty but Thou Art Rich so we'll just look at this I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty he's saying I know it I know what you're going through I know your tribulation I know you're poor and however you'd want to amplify that with all the different translations or commentaries God is acknowledging their pain their suffering what they're going through what they've lost what they stand to lose what they have not gained all their toil and everything that they're going through God is acknowledging it and brother Adam looks at it this way in chapter 4 the church age book now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation nope he does not right so this is this is the point of contention that here he is he's right there he's looking at everybody's suffering and he's got the power to stop it he's got the power maybe to draw back the hands of the persecutor he's got the power to keep them from feeling the pain he's got power to keep them from death but yet he doesn't do it he simply says I know your tribulation I'm not at all unmindful of your suffering in other words maybe it would be one thing if God just kind of had this filter where he couldn't see suffering and and to him he literally is just perceiving everything is just Rosy God has these Supernatural rose-colored glasses where whatever you're going through to him he's like that's awesome I'm so glad they're going through that but he's saying no I I that that is not good that is nasty I cannot believe you're having to go through that God's looking at it real he's like man that's horrible that's awful and brother I'm saying he's saying yeah I know I know you're suffering I know you're going through tribulation I know this is very painful this is very very deep no I know I'm not being deceived I'm not blinded I'm not somewhere where I can't see and he goes what a stumbling block this is to so many people the fact that God knows and he doesn't intervene so then he brings us to Israel like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just in loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer and this is the this is the uh the softest view this is the argument this is the philosophy this is the the one that reasons against God this is the one who says in his heart the fool who says there is no God he says if God says he's love but he does not intervene on his people's behalf in the face of genocide and the Holocaust and pain and the suffering of even the the martyrs throughout Christendom said that can't be God because if there was a god this bad things wouldn't be happening and this is where people get hung up this is where people struggle is he says I know your poverty I know your tribulation I know what you're going through but yet he does not stop it but let me say this this is the point that brother Branham is emphasizing perfect love is pure it can only Act or not act so either it's either he's overt overtly acting or he's refraining from acting to serve and fulfill God's purpose so God the love of God is pure so the love of God may see tribulation and I hope you're catching this may see suffering but it won't act because it has to allow things that work to the good has to allow things that work to God's perfect will so pure love will only act or it will not act unless it fulfills or serves to fulfill God's Divine Purpose now our human concepts of just our human concepts of equity or fairness or sensitivity or human concept of love those are impure those are not perfect things they're they're partial they're prideful so when we think of love we think well how can God love people if he doesn't intervene when they're suffering we're using our our human love and say well I mean if they're dying stop it if they're suffering why wouldn't you if you had the power to do it and so since we're not finite or since we're not infinite and we don't have infinite power we think if God is Supernatural and if a train was barreling down a train track and it's headed for 300 a car of three cars of 300 people on the train track and if the train keeps going that direction 300 people are going to die but you can switch the tracks and the train can detour its course and kill three people on a track that's being repaired what would you do and it's this ethical question and and the human starts to wrestle well do you just allow fate to transpire that this is the path the car was supposed to go on so it's ethical to allow the train to continue down the path that would go down and kill the majority of people because it wouldn't be ethical to switch the track and actually choose to kill three people would it we need to take an Ethics Course right and so then they derive from that do that which is performs the greater good for the greater number of people right greater for Humanity and they wrestle with these questions well because that's what humans have to do right they're trying to come up with some sense of what is right but then we would say God why don't you just take that train and float it right your God why don't you just cause it to transport on the other side so we think well God met if God God is all-powerful and all-knowing then he could just move things around and cause a breach in the space-time Continuum and let it pass through some sort of portal on the other side because that's what we would do as humans right we could keep people from suffering and dying and never having any pains or aches we would just figure out a way to make that happen but that is an imperfect love I want to use the phrase but at the risk of maybe focusing too much on a hit from 1964 but it's Tainted Love is what it is it's something that's an impure love it's something that's not uh there's something that's missing messing with it we can even say well humans have the capacity to love and let's just say it stands on it's it's its own thing but it stays it has all these other roommates right in the spirit they're kind of saying well you know right and they influence it and love all of a sudden now has jealousy that kind of leans against it or hatred retribution right or memory reason affection all these things kind of leans against it it's like oh I think you should do this and so love can get weighed down where it's not just even if I can say it's not just maybe the feelio love but what anger acts remember talks about how that human love will murder somebody there's something even powerful about the human love where human love will lay down its own life a mother will do that for its child and so this is where the confusion comes in that love can be contained and just because we say it's love and it is love it may not be perfect love brother Branham says then this is the next part after he quotes from Malachi he says you see they could not figure out God's love what a stumbling block why does God if he loves him why does he let him suffer they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant to baby with parental care and some of you are saying oh my goodness I can repeat this back I can spell it backwards I hear it so often and I know maybe we hear it a lot and I've repeated it a lot and I trust that it's always coming from a good place if I'm repeating it but they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant no meant a baby with parental care so we know that a a natural attribute and I'd even say a correct attribute of a parent would be that parental love will protect an innocent baby so when they say that they thought that love meant no suffering then they draw from this idea that a mother or a father would never let their baby suffer and endure pain or difficulty but we could say then but there has to be a better understanding of love because if you narrow that that's God's love it's kind of that doting love or that that love of a newborn parental love will protect an innocent baby but it may also enable a stubborn adolescent hope you caught that just parental love I'm not talking about perfect love but parental love may be so careful for their child that they don't want them to suffer they don't want them to be bullied they don't want to go through this I don't want them to feel pain and that's coming from a good place but that same kind of love later on in adolescence can actually enable right back the wrong kind of character in their child and it's all because parental love I don't want them to have to go through that I went through that as a child and I was raised in a really strict message home and I had it shoved down my throat and it was all a bunch of legalism and I don't want my child to grow up that way and they do it because they have some sort of compassion and synth feeling for the child and they don't want them to live through what they live through but yet it can be that very concept of love that thinks it's looking out for the child's character that actually is doing more harm and damage or just as much phrase if you if you love me then you would right and when we say that or if you love them you would or if you loved me you would it implies some sort of preconceived idea of what love should feel like when we when we receive it or what it should look like when we give it but God's love in this example that brother Brandon's using both in Revelations 2 9 and then even with the Jews it was being manifested in a way that was opposite of the human Notions of love but perfect love always protects God's purpose perfect level always protect God perfect parental love may try to protect the person parental love may try to protect the parent or the person but God's perfect love will always protect God's purpose it may offend it may hurt but it never will offend or hurt God's will notice in First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that year Abel but will also with the Temptation excuse me but will with the Temptation also make a way of to escape that you may be able to bear it if we kind of rephrased it in other words it's saying God is faithful who will suffer you to be tempted right it's it's implied explicitly in the text God is faithful he will allow you to be tempted but the second part is he'll allow you to be tempted but he won't suffer you to be tempted above that you're able so perfect love allows temptation we now this is when it starts getting real God in his perfect love will allow temptation but he will not allow it above that which you're able but he will equip and give you the tools and the resources you need to escape whatever Temptation he allows so God perfect love allows Temptation perfect love allows tribulation it allows suffering but it's not always so with parental love parental love can be tainted parental Love Can it can be in a way Act can it acts on a waitress says well I don't want them to suffer perfect love will allow you to be tempted parental love which is Tainted or or it's it's not it's not in harmony uh with God's perfect will it can act in a way says I don't want them to be tempted but God says I'll allow him to be tempted so what we do is we just don't ever want them to be tempted and we do it through legalism and controls but we're never actually equipping our children to deal with temptation we're just keeping them from it completely so that whenever they are tempted they're like wow oh my goodness I didn't even know this existed this is an arcade of fun right because you did so good at keeping them from anything that you haven't quipped them to say oh nope I gotta get out of here so this parental love in that God will allow you to suffer will allow excuse me perfect love allow you to suffer like to go tribulation but it has its limits right it's not gonna let you go too far it's going to equip it's going to teach it's going to it's going to help you but the parental love can be tainted but let me say this not in some sort of overtly evil way because we'd say somebody who says they love their kid and they're just going to punch him in the face and say no you can't even confuse that as love right and so there's certain things that can be pure aggression pure abuse but then even in the more subtle ways is what I'm talking about that we think oh this is I I'm just gonna I just want to love them and I just want to protect them I just want to Shield them now this might come come at you from a little bit of a different angle but first John chapter 3 verse 20. for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things yeah this stands for the principle that God's love is greater than our human love and as I was studying it this week it just became so powerful to me in light of these things that I'm sharing with you this evening that our human love says if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart God who is love if our hearts condemn us love is greater perfect love is greater than our hearts and perfect love knows all things but we don't so and what did the way I came to me and struck me is that there's almost this competition between the human love and God's love that our hearts condemn us but God is greater than our hearts so that our it's our human love judging God's perfect love it's this human The Condemned heart is this battle between perfect love and human love perfect love and parental love that maybe I've got this notion I've got this idea I've got this concept but then we have this sense so God help me to express this I have the sense of the Divine I have perfect love in my soul I have that welling up within me this is what this is what I need to say this is what I need to do this is what's right perfect love starts to operate but then the heart goes oh oh no you can't do that and it's your heart that is condemning condemning God's perfect will condemning your unction condemning your inspiration and so there's this wrestle between what perfect love is and what your heart thinks perfect love is perfect love will act or not act in your best interest perfect level always act in the best interest of the one who's receiving the love perfect love is it's being projected is always acting in the best interest of the one who is being loved when the Bible says that Jesus saw the Rich Young Ruler he projected love to him as he projected love to him he told him what he needed to hear told him maybe what hurt and it was the very thing that caused him to walk away and we might all be like oh no no no no no no no no no you should have just said hey buddy come along let's do this and it's going to be okay and kind of work with them a little bit because I mean this guy's Rich if he just starts paying his ties gets a little bit of offerings we can knock down another wall we can add the mezzanine we're looking at right there's a lot of ways we start thinking you know walk softly right let's figure this out but Jesus knew what he needed that was love that there was no selfishness in it there was no impurity in it he he was spoken in such a way where this is what he needed to hear so pure love perfect love when it's projected it is always in the interest of a person's salvation there's always in the interest of their perfection and their Glory that that's the way that it works perfect love can never manifest and then tend to someone's corruption now one can reject the manifestation and that's what where the corruption is so it says if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and then Noah says there's knoweth all things this might be my my huge turn here our hearts condemn Us in other words our hearts judge God's love it judge's perfect love it's at odds with it they couldn't figure out God's love they thought it meant always meant like a A Parent's Love for a baby but you know what as that baby grows the expression of Love Changes right because you realize that what this child needs is it it needs it needs discipline it needs correction it needs to grow he says for our heart if our hearts condemn us and we wrestle with God's perfect love perfect love is greater than our love and he says and this love knows all things this is the way I want you to look at it tonight I'm not putting a period on and I'm not trying to change the meaning of the scripture but since he knows all things he sees the big picture he not only knows perfectly what has been and we don't there's so many times in our interactions with one another that we see something happen in a certain way but from the other person's vantage point it's the complete opposite and so what we see and what they see is completely different so their reaction completely befuddles us why do you do that why did he act that way why did he respond that way because we see it one way but to them they completely see it another and so we have a hard time trying to figure out why the person's acting this way why they're responding that way why they're going through that way we feel really justified in how we feel and how we think we got a beat of the situation the other person is looking at the same way I don't can't believe they would do that why would they say that to me and they see it completely different but God knows all things he sees it exactly for what it was and because he knows all things he looked beyond the moment he knows the past perfectly that got him there we don't and he sees beyond the moment and knows where it's taken them and so he can see the true need in that moment so in perfect love acts he this is this is how love looks and that's why I phrased it that way how does love look well not only what does it look like but how does it see things how does love look how does it look to me but how does it see how does it view things and this is how God looks it knows more than what our human heart knows and so we just judge and we condemn and we even condemn ourselves God says I'm looking at the bigger picture here buddy you may think that love dictates this to happen in this moment but I know what has been to get us here and I know what will be and I know where where you need to be so I know what you need right now to get you where you want to be listen to this in the sermon why Christ speak welcome to the after hour it says many times when we look at the scriptures in our own way of looking it seems very hard can we say Amen to that we can look at scriptures of your heart we can look at our life and our decisions and the things we go through it can be very hard but now he's saying we look at scriptures in our own way of thinking it seems very hard but if we studied a little while we find out that the all-wise God knows just what he's doing let that if those of you who are jotting this down I hope you get the wording just right so you can look this up we find out that the all-wise God knows just what he's doing and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side he knows what's really in the man now the sermon title why Christ speak and in this summer there was a lot of tough love towards Moses but brother Brown gives us this great key to say this isn't the template for how you deal with everybody it says God knows we find out the all-wise God knows just exactly what he's doing could I say this to us who are parents we realize that even within our own family that the more kids we have that we realize that one thing works for one but it may not work for the other and what can be super effective for one child can be actually super ineffective or destructive for another and you would leave that up to the parent to know and you'd hope that that's something they're invested in and they're conscious of so he says he knows the all-wise God knows what he's doing and I want you to think this is perfect love perfect knows perfect love knows what it's doing he knows perfect love knows how to do things and how to deal with man perfect love knows what's in man perfect love knows him we don't human love doesn't we only know from the intellectual side perfect love knows what's really in the man so no it that's the that's where it says God is greater than our heart and knows all things that it it can see things from a different perspective so look at Revelations 2 9 again I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty he knows all that I know how you're struggling I know you're poor I know you're going through tribulation I know you're suffering but Thou Art rich and I feel it's put in there in such a way to say I know your works I know your tribulation I know your poverty and even though you may not see it I do you're actually rich it's the exact opposite of what he had to say about laodicea you think you're rich increase with good head needed nothing but you're actually the opposite you know it's perfect love knows when somebody's destitute and they may think they've got it all but perfectly says no they don't have what they need but then in the opposite someone may feel they have nothing at all but he says but I know you're rich if I can say this perfect love knew something they didn't they only saw suffering we only see suffering they only saw poverty or experience poverty but he saw the real value of what they did have they had Works they had Faith they had these other things that they knew the blasphemy within this say they were Jews and God looked and says if you have that you're rich and we fixate on other things well if God really loved me I'd have no Cloudy Skies if God really loved me I'd have this if God really he's looking he says no we'll think about what you have what you're rich in he saw what they didn't see and this is what perfect love sees this is how perfect love looks this is what perfect love looks like then in the midst of their tribulation and their suffering and their poverty and everything they were going through he says but you're rich the man said you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant to baby with parental care but this is his response to that but God said that his love was elective love in other words it's deliberate it's intentional I know that elective love and especially in the way that brother Branham emphasizes initially is like well God chooses us but if in light of the choosing where God is making this is where so many scriptures start coming into view God is making all things work together according to his perfect will according to that that which he purposed in himself in the beginning so instead of just looking at his gun saying well I chose you I chose you and I chose you and that's God's love but God's love is elective love and that God has something he's wanting to accomplish it's very it's very deter the determinate is wisdom is deliberate it is intentional so his love isn't well I just chose you and whatever happens to you at least I love you right right can't you all just be happy with God's love and like okay I guess I'll be happy with God's love but it's more than just knowing that he loves us but it's trusting the love that he has to us realizing that his love is elective in other words it's deliberate and it's intentional that God has a purpose in it and if I could say this that God our character our happiness our pure joy our well-being our meant to well-being our physical health all those things are the totality of our person God will perfect that which concerneth me our character is at the heart of God's love when we preach character development and the judgment and rewards series part seven these these all those themes could just be considered in here to where that suffering perfects our character and it may be the Instinct of human love to shelter to protect that could somehow if I could somehow construct a home and and construct a life and put all the safeguards in to where they they never know one they never know one Temptation they never know one difficulty they don't know any suffering at all I'm just going to make everything work for him and I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do it and I'm just going to try to figure out a way that's what level it'll provide and level do this and level do that and we start pursuing that then we're actually acting in a way that is not perfect love because perfect love simply put keeps God's will his love may allow us to suffer his love may allow us to endure tribulation his level allow us to experience loss but it's always intentional it's always deliberate God will only allow it to serve his purpose God will only allow it to the extent that it perfects our character God will only allow it because he knows that it'll produce the true joy that he desires for us whereas we want the synthetic Joy right we want to we want to we want things to kind of be contrived and figured out and and manipulate and and produce the Perfect Image but God says I know you're only going to have peace one way and I know that it has to come with the price and if we take the if we take the Tainted Love and we take the approach The Human Side of Things We actually Rob ourselves of the glory that God has for us is it making sense I I think that maybe we could have emphasized this a little bit different way tonight but I trust we'll have more opportunities when C.S Lewis wrote actually I think it was post published after his death it was actually done in a pseudonym a different name I can't remember why they actually did this but anybody familiar with a grief observed and C.S Lewis wrote it at the loss of his wife and he makes this statement to me this statement is so up moving because as he suffered this great loss and as he's observing grief and what it does to a person and if I could back up and just maybe look at it in general that we might say well I never want my I never want love would never let someone cry never let them experience loss it's just going to shelter and coddle and nurture and so we have this idea of that perfect love now hopefully this is helping you in the vertical and the horizontal that we we sometimes misunderstand God's love because brother Branham says it explicitly in the smyrnian church age I'm summarizing a lot in this he says we say oh well bad things are happening to me means God doesn't love me he said no Cloudy Skies don't mean God doesn't love you neither do you know clear skies mean that he loves you don't ever go by that is God's will for us is perfection and he left a measure of suffering for us that while suffering we'd be made perfect and he teaches us those things so we can understand this so whatever it is that God's love is allowing that God in his wisdom and in his love allows us to go through these trials that's God's love that lets it happen because if it wouldn't produce righteous fruit if it wouldn't be able to produce peace if it wouldn't be able to perfect your character God would stop it right because all things work together for the good I I guess this is maybe one way I could say the reason why that works is because God loves us and he'll never let anything happen that can't work for our good all right and so as God would intervene in that particular instance or we would expect him to not to suffer not to feel pain not to sorrow not to read all these different disconcerting emotions and pain and suffering that we feel human love might say oh no no no no no no let's save them from that C.S Lewis is looking at what he's gone through and the suffering and his perspective on it I think is very helpful he says God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their true quality their quality in other words I I love you and I have faith and God's like well let's see about that right oh I love you with the perfect love I've got perfect faith and God says well let me test you first so I can figure this out and that's the way that we view tests right in our experience tests are only ever given and this is our natural experience only ever given so that the instructor knows where we're at right so when we think of a test right oh God's trying to find out how much he's taught me he knows how much you know hey he's not testing you so he can well they're not getting the material I need to kind of change this a little bit no the test is for you the test is so that I'm awakened and I'm made aware of where I'm at so that I recognize I know I love you but my love's falling short and I know I believe you but my faith is falling short this is the principle that C.S Lewis is expressing he's not trying an experiment in my faith in my love to find out what their quality is like oh well I'll show you you know we'll see whether or not you love me he says he knew it already it was I who didn't now this is coming from a safe place because this isn't God trying to expose you as a fraud this is God trying to unloose the perfect love instead of the human love because we can love God with the human love and be very Ardent right people can give their lives you know for Muhammad right they can give us a love a passion a Zeal for something and not be real he says in this trial he makes us occupy the dock the jury box the witness box and the bench the judge all at once in other words you're on trial and you're the judge you're the witness and you're the jury we're the only ones trying and being tried God's not being tried his words not being tried uh he's not trying us because well you said you believe me can I just dig around in your heart a little bit to find out if it's true he knows all things he knew it already I was the one that did in this trial this examination he says we occupy the doc the witness box the bench he always knew that my temple was a house of cards his only way of making me realize the fact was to knock it down what would do that only love would do you realize how sometimes we act with our children that when they get something wrong we don't tell them you say well what how what how much is this or what oh right that's good right we don't want them to fix we don't want them to be told they're wrong we don't want and I'm not saying it's wrong necessarily do it just I'm just referring to the Natural Instinct that we have sometimes to encourage to to to to help along and to make people feel good and try to make them feel great and we say oh well brother Brown said a great man is one who makes you feel great so we think well we just pump them up with a bunch of nonsense right but this is God this is true love God knew that you had something that was merely pretense God knows that you have something that in the gut check time you can't actually rely on it God knows that what that is isn't perfect it's not pure he knows that's tainted so he and his wisdom allows something to happen so that we realize oh no that was a house of cards it's love that makes us realize this is the love that I think is just so different and contrary to the human idea of love it was his only way of making me realize the fact was knocking down my house of cards and yes that may not feel good yes that may may be messy yes that may be hard but love is what allows that and I believe this is the lesson that we need to learn in receiving perfect love but also in showing perfect love because what perfect love is doing is removing all the tainting all the imperfections it's removing all the perversion from our human love how does love look in its expression then also in how it sees Brothers if you could come to your instruments we'll close with this statement from the message shalom he says sometimes they ask me why why must these things happen what why why did this happen to me why did I start and this happen and I had this trouble here and this upset me here and I lost this here all right good questions have some of us asked these before why did this happen why did I lose this why did I start here and not be able to finish there why did why does this happen and these questions are natural and these questions arise because what are what is what is someone trying to figure out what's the reason for this why did this happen so when we ask why it's because we lack a satisfactory answer as to the intent that if we say oh I know exactly where that happened because if that hadn't happened this wouldn't happen I see it perfectly right when we can figure that out we're satisfied and we don't ask the questions anymore and I don't think we should necessarily try to figure it out ourselves because that's human nature to try to come up with an answer to these questions what why and you may say well brother Adam said if you question God you can't believe God next statement in the very next statement sometimes I've asked why because it's a natural human response because perfect love knows all things in our imperfect love is left saying why why when I was a young Minister first started out did God take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart why did he do that I didn't know I do now [Music] but perfect love knew and I know that's that's that's maybe just honing in on a particular area that we should just probably just say you know what we don't know let's just leave it alone but even though we don't know doesn't mean God didn't God knew exactly what he was doing God knows how to orchestrate things in our lives because he knows what's best for us he's not just after making you feel good he's after perfect character he's not just out for making your life easy and fine and everything seemed neat and Rosy God's after he's looking at the end and he knows what he has to put you through in order to get you where you need to be to be perfect to be satisfied to be trusting why why did he do that I didn't know I do now I just held my hand in his and kept trusting he knows every Junction he knows the Rhythm must when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use oh this makes me become so much more sincere with my if I say filial love or with how I'm expressing love I want the love of God to be shed abroad in my heart but Lord I it needs to be according to knowledge it's got to be according to your perfect will it can't be according to my preconceived ideas of what I think is going to make things work and those perfect love sees what is actually needed it knows in that particular instance this is the right thing that's what makes perfect love so beautiful it never acts wrong even if when we see it we're like well that seems really really hard but if it's perfect love it's right even when we sit like well that seemed kind of lazy or lousy that seemed kind of soft-handed where where's the rebuke where where's the tough love brother Aaron should you should have really come down hard on it but let me just say if that is God's perfect love then it's right so what we ask ourselves is what is God's perfect will what is he trying to achieve and Lord let me never act in a way that undermines what you're trying to do brother Brown are many times if you just you kind of take this from the message there's this very clear principle oh oh I got a devil I'm sick heal me it's like well can we talk a little bit and figure out why because God could be using that for a reason there could be a reason that God allowed it why not to prove that that sin is wrong but to perfect something that's lacking inside of us to not leave us as we are we've built this beautiful house of cards God is nice God is just nice and he wants to say you've tried really hard making this house of cards and maybe he he wants he wants to make us feel good for all our efforts but he realized I'm not doing you a service by letting you live in a house of cards so he just lets the devil bump the table and everything falls apart and this is love that does that and he says he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what material he's going to use he says God knows what's in a man he knows him we don't he knows what's really in the man and he's taking it from why Christ speak we're here Moses came to a place and he's kind of groveling he's kind of whining and God took tough love I says I told you what to do I told you exactly what to do just do what I told you to do and brother answered God wanted to kick him while he was down he said oh my goodness how is that even right God knew what was in Moses he knew what Moses needed in the moment and then you come later to Elijah and here he is he's depressed he's he goes to hide and he's fleeing he comes he's running away says oh no he's wanting to run away and he's like oh no and he flees to a cave and he's driven there and he's all depressed and God says I know what he needs he needs a still small voice he needs an angel with the softest hands why you just kick Elijah while he was down perfect love knows what's in a man knows how to mold us perfect love is so easily misunderstood when it's taken out of context of God's perfect will when we take it out of the context of God's Eternal purpose that God love is always acting to promote God's perfect will perfect love is this is how love looks I want this kind of perfect love I want this kind of perfect love for my children I want this kind of perfect love for my neighbor I want this kind of perfect love for others to where I'm not trying to force an image of Love or a Look of Love that's pleasing and placable applicable to others and kind of makes everyone happy and it just kind of it's something that'll kind of help grow the church in a real Dynamic way that that's always going to fail even if it succeeded in ways that the world says great job your numbers are awesome you want to do it in a way that satisfies God's perfect will that kind of love won't withhold the good that is due to someone but it also won't avoid necessary pain [Music] I think I could ask all the questions I did in the beginning because I don't believe that we've even answered what does it look like we just know better that it doesn't always look like we think it will could we stand together tonight
