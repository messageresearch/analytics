TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] now let's turn to Ruth chapter 1 we'll read verse two just jump into the word this evening Ruth chapter 1 verse two glad to see all of you out to the house of the Lord this evening I trust the Lord would be your portion Ruth chapter 1 verse 2 and the name of the man was IMC and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Mahan and kilan ephes of Bethlehem Judah and they came came into the country of Moab and continued there we've been on this verse for a few Services we're wanting just to again focus on that last phrase how this man his wife and two sons left Israel left Bethlehem Judah and came into the country of Moab and continued there let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we are grateful to be able to be in your presence this evening and it's encouraging to see one another even if we took time to ponder the circumstance is that those that are amongst us they that they left and even the things that would have hindered them it would encourage us even the more to understand the sacrifice that was in their obedience this evening to be in your house and Lord so we're refreshed and revived by seeing one another and encouraged but to feel your presence as we have to know that you desire to speak to us as we expect you to that's what makes this midweek service so special to us that we are not merely participating in a recreational sport this is not a hobby this is not a gathering of the flesh but this is something that means more than life to us as it's connected to things that are Eternal and Supernatural so we ask that you'd come now Lord and just break the bread of life to us and encourage us speak to us in a plain way may you have your way in this service Lord as we take a few moments to look into your word and the message of the hour and have it speak to our hearts we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be seated as we've been speaking on the subject of the bread of life and Come to Bethlehem I'd like to uh try to maybe wrap up these first two verses as we've been looking at them and uh trying to draw out these different types and meanings as they would uh have relevance to us not merely looking at a story to try to figure out the different ways that we could type things but when brother brandom said there's a hidden revelation in the Book of Ruth that when you catch it it'll bring you real close to God and he prayed that those hearing him that morning when he preached uh Kinsman redeemers that they could uh just their whole heart and soul would be held Spellbound and uh to hear God and see him what he is in this story and what he means to us and how we can accept him and just those kind of uh that kind of statement to preface looking into the Book of Ruth get gets our attention we begin to think Lord I want to slow down and process uh what you are in the story and what you what you are to me as it's typed out in the story so that we can really gain the full benefit from it and I'd say our desires to draw closer to the Lord then in him giving us this Revelation or bringing out more of this Revelation in the Book of Ruth will help us to do that and just in the few Services we've spent on this there's just been many wonderful things that stand out uh that are relevant to us today because we see at the parallel in the type I've been looking at this phrase and they came into the country of Moab and continued there so IMC has left Bethlehem Judah which is the house of God's bread a place of blessing the promised land they're leaving Bethlehem Judah to go into Moab is a evidence of a rebellion and it is something that was foreshadowing Israel forsaking God to choose their own King and it was uh going to a place that had been cursed that so there was no this was not a man just looking out after his family but this was an act of rebellion instead of just yielding to God and repenting and last time and this time I'm wanting to just look at the characteristics of Moab because there's a a great uh type to us in that we see Ruth is the one that types the bride so we could look at ALC we could look at Naomi we could look at the two sons we could look at orpa and there's a lot of things that we could look at and begin to type things and understand certain characteristics and they can be signpost us or Warnings or there could be admonishment contained in it but we know that Ruth we're very certain that that Ruth represents the bride she is a gentile that is going to be wed to Boaz and then through her lineage is going to come Christ uh and and we know David is comes from that household and so this she represents the bride but then we're stopping and taking notice that she was a moabitas and she's called out of Moab and since she is a type of the Bride the fact that she's called out of Moab represents something to us today who have heard the voice of Revelation Revelations 18:4 come out of for my people that have had a message to turn our hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers so Moab as we look at it it is a type and it represents what Ruth or what the bride is called out of and I can say it's part of that hidden revelation that God can Quicken to us and when it when he does it brings us closer to God we saw a number of statements from the message of the hour where brother Ram is identifying Moab as a type of the natural church and you take the things that he emphasizes and you look at things in their history we know that they did not have a very good beginning as Moab was the son of lot through lot's own daughter and that means the son of lot would be a covering a religious covering there was a religious attitude that they had so taking the teachings of the message of the hour we could see that Moab represents carnal religion and in a a phrase that we could even Ponder ourselves what it means and the implications of it it represents religion that's become political to where it there's it's no longer the Holy Spirit that's leading by the word of God but it becomes more of a pol a political uh uh setup that begins to dominate and Rule and govern and so Moab represents then if it's something if it's a carnal church if it's carnal religion if it's a church led by politics if it's a religion that's propped up by uh um by politics then we know this is a denominational condition Moab represents a denominational condition and we check ourselves by say no that doesn't mean we have to go join an actual official organization that doesn't mean it's just uh the Lutheran denomination or it doesn't mean it's just the Methodist denomination but a denominational Spirit can be within a a collection of churches that identifies independent it can actually exist within a particular Church a church that comes under denominational nickan Spirit or denominational Spirit or we could be a denomination to ourselves it's an ideology it's some way of thinking it's some way of acting and traditionally trying to ser of God where we do it more by denomination and the attributes of denomination than we do by the spirit of God and his word and brother brandom identifies this particular aspect of Moab quite often how fundamental they were a and and this is this is expressed in how balum offered worship and how he presented himself and so in in this his brother bam emphasizes it over and over again Moab represents kind of religious fundamentalism or just a fundamental way of serving God and in certain things foundationally can be in place and and it can be even uh strictly correct according to the letter of the word so there's this is what Moab represents and he identifies it as a system of organization that Moab is organized and they had a system of organization he identifies their politics and how they they were motivated by politics and and he he uses the phrases and and I know I'm summarizing and if you were here last time you're able just to pick up right on it I know that you listen to the word of God and you hear the voice of the of the Prophet so you know these things that he taught but he identifies how that Moab impersonates a form of God impersonates a form of the word of God and it does it through politics and he uses the phrase some kind of system now if you're wondering well brother Aaron it's not a political season the elections already happened after Trump got voted out I've burned all my political Flags I'm never voting again it's all rigged and it's a fraud I'm not talking about those kind of politics and and and before you think wow we're just not an organization I I really want you to challenge challenge yourself to be more Discerning about the elements of organization and the elements of system and how they can work on us to keep us from fully walking into the word of God because that's what we're going to identify about more about Moab this evening is how where where they met Israel in the journey is very striking and what they did to try to keep Israel from Crossing into the promised land is very enlightening because then we could say Lord give me wisdom to identify anything that may be of a moabi is nature in my life that would try to keep me from walking fully in the promise of God and it's systems that do it and this statement has been a lot to me now over the last few years and uh I actually had thought I'd maybe used it a few times already here at our church and uh I went back and tried to find where I've used it I don't know if I've even had the opportunity really to use this uh uh here but and I found I think only one other place I even used it recently but it's one that I've constantly kept before me because it's very instructive brother rman in the sermon the world has fallen apart he says the whole systems are falling apart something wrong so the systems of this world the political systems the the the the ideologies and the structures are all falling apart he says we want to seriously think of this for the next few minutes don't just enter this now just say well we walked over here sat down we had breakfast we heard testimonies and so forth as it was being done in a breakfast setting he's said we ought to be more serious about this and not casual but let's with all our hearts get down to this and think of it remember it's our life and there's nothing no more important than our life there's nothing no more important no matter how much we gain in the world or how great we become here we've got to be we've got to come to the end of the road that's a telling time and we must approach it with all the sincerity we know how to do so this is him prefacing what he's about to say to sober the people up a little bit say what I'm about to tell you just isn't my take on worldly systems but it relates to your own life relates to your your thriving in the word of God when people in the other times when people tried to find some way of survival and they went to systems so he's identifying how World Systems are falling apart there's something wrong and he's saying that these systems that men adapt or adopt or put into place they are things that they do to survive it's a way of keeping a organizations to survive it's a way to keep ideology alive it's a way to keep uh um some structure if you want it to survive you want it to exist and subsist and keep going on there's got to be a system that that's put into place in order to Pro protect and PR preserve so he says when they've tried to do this they've tried to survive they go to systems and the only way that they can go to any other system than the way that God has laid down is to get away from his word good thing we're all vaccinated right excuse me so it says the only way they can get to any other system than the way that God has laid down is to get away from his word men in other ages have done this now notice that because I I want to come back to that in the end if you if you're going to go into some system other than the one that God has provided because we read last time where abam was talking about systems he says well God has a system so it's not maybe system in itself that's wrong but if it's man-made we don't want it he says but if you're going to get to something that's away from his word or that God hasn't laid down then you're getting away from his word so says men in other ages have done this in times past they all tried to get away and tried to control the world so it's a matter of control it's a matter of um exerting influence and then deriving the benefit from that control and influence and make a system of politics in different things to try to control and hold the world together this is what man does this is his his weak his weakness that when he wants to control something he's got to implement a system of politics in different ways to control and hold the things together and they in order to do that they get away from God's plan of doing it God has a better way of holding things together than man does God has a better way of sustaining things than man does we recognize the tendency of man to even re see that God has done something and God has revealed something and brother B identifies it in the church age book where they begin to whisper how can we protect this great truth we need to organize we need to set up a system we need to be able to protect this from being translated the wrong way or people coming in and changing it or people prizing our people and and and moving them the way there's got to we got to control this and brother saying this is man's tendency but God has a way of controlling things he says God has a way of keeping this thing together that's what we should trust in God has a way of keeping this thing together and the only way that men can ever adopt some other way he has to get away from the original way so God has an original way God has his own system God has his word that he's laid down God has his pattern his system his structure his means of control his means of keeping things in order he has a way of keeping this together and if you adopt some other way and get away from his original way you haven't created a system where the individual believer can Thrive within it but the system can Thrive the system can develop very very robustly and seem to be a well-oiled machine and accomplishing many great things but if you get away from the established way in God's original way all you're doing is surviving as a church we don't want to survive as a church we actually want individuals to thrive I really that's the mark of a church that's uh thriving a church that's growing a church that's benefiting from the word of God is when individuals and families are actually growing in the grace of God and they're and they're they're increasing in wisdom the families are not the church we don't want a church to to grow at the expense of the families thank you someone's provided me with the cough drop I apologize for annoying this person to the point to where they dug into their own personal stash of cough drops and says Lord help this help this young man to make it through service appreciate that thank you so now Moab was very fundamentally established and I'm wanting to take this statement of brother Bram how he's talking about manmade Survival Systems and kind of look at this in terms of Mo the moabites because brother random identifies their structure their organization their systems and we were ending last time and talking about how it gave them this uh that lifted them up it gave this sense that they were greater than everyone else I would say it certainly gave them a false sense of security but they were really really lifted up in how well organized they were and how well established they were and even how long they'd been there they might they might have even thought about Israel and said hey you left we stayed we've been here longer H H and so we're we're better off than you are and so they were definitely lifted up in their structure and brother says that Moab looked down on Israel the moabites when they heard about Israel coming through and they even as they heard about their testimonies they had a way of explaining it away and they they didn't believe this and they didn't believe that they looked down on Israel and a statement we ended with last time is brother was talking about how the Queen of Sheba Could Teach the Pentecostals saying you support things out there that laugh and make fun of Divine Healing and yet you support the radio programs instead of your own church that's right and laugh and make fun of the very things you believe in so it ought to shake us to think Lord I want to be sure that my support is in the right thing that my my efforts and my resources and my time and my prayers a and what I give myself over to and even in our giving he's saying that we we want to support the things we know will support God's program support the things that God's wanting to accomplish I feel like those things kind of help uh bring us back to where we were uh last Wednesday night when we ended now if you turn to Numbers chapter 22 with me I'd like to I'd like just to take this as a starting point to look into some of these other aspects of Moab numbers CH 22:1 it says and the children of Israel set forward and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho as you you look at this place where they pitched their tents it was in the plains of Moab and it's saying just on the other side of Jericho uh next to Jericho but on the other side of the Jordan River from it and this area that they settled in it was land that one time belonged to Moab it was land that Moab at one time possessed as their own H but they had lost it and now when Israel comes they take this land from the amorites so it's very interesting I pondered this today how that Mo Israel shows up and they take land back that the moabites had lost and I'm sure that that might have been some offense to them because at one time well we believe this and we held this and we had that and then Israel comes along and kicks out this King H and they take over this land land that that rightfully at one time belonged to the moabites and now that's where Israel is and and I actually realizing now that I forgot to include the slide that would have showed just this ex exact spot where they were but they were at the closest point to the promised land that they had been in this whole Exodus they were 5 to seven miles from Jericho so they're right there the Jordan Rivers before them they're going to cross the Jordan River they're going to go in and Conquer Jericho uh once we get into the Book of Joshua these events are very near as we're in Numbers chapter 22 and there's a few chapters that deal with some issues that take place right there within the next few months and then we're going to see that it's this in this place where Moses dies and it's where there's a change of leadership there's actually a change of leadership where now Joshua which is the type of the holy spirit is going to take those who'd followed the prophet all the way up to the door of this change to the door of crossing over the Jordan Moses goes off the scene but there's still a fulfillment of the message that Moses brought and it's the Holy Spirit Joshua that's going to take the children of Israel across the Jordan River into the promised land and so this is they're 5 to S miles from Jericho these are the events that are going to take place before them and notice how brother bham makes lays it out this way and we use this a larger portion of a statement from God does God change his mind last time and we're just going to pick up on a couple sentences left or two sentences that opened up that statement last time he says Israel of the Old Testament is the type of the Bride of the New Testament and and he's looking at this journey of Israel out of Egypt and the challenges that they faced in the Exodus coming up out of the world marching on the road to Canaan he says or the Canaan that we go to the Millennium now there's no question that we can type the promised land as the baptism of goes that there was Wars and there was fightings and there was killings and how that when we've received the baptism Holy Ghost there's still a positional placing within the promised land of the individual believer and the church in type as a whole but here brother mam is you wanting us to look at it this way that there's a type of the church in The Exodus of Israel out of Egypt in the wilderness into Canaan he says or the Millennium he says now we notice Moab here is a type of the church and in and the way he places it you have to stay within the confines of this type that he's trying to dry trying to draw up Israel come and settles right there in the land of the moabites right there within their borders so to speak or right there next to him but between Moab and the Jordan River and just beyond it is what bram's typing as the Millennium he says Moab is the type of the church so you have Moab right there where Israel is right before they're going to cross over into the promised land and so here we are the bride right next to Moab in this type of this in the type of the uh the bride coming up out of Egypt entered the promised land bams want us to think about Moab as the type of the church now in Numbers Chapter 13 and I I want to take a step back for a moment just to kind of preface where we are in Numbers chapter 22 in Numbers Chapter 13 12 Spies have gone out into the uh into the promised land their 40 days they're in there Gathering the evidence they come back they at caders Baria they tell they tell the people of Israel hey it's just exactly like God said it was but so God was right about the fact that it's a land flowing with milk and honey but he was wrong about the fact that we could take it and he makes and they make that uh that stand there and because they make that stand they wander in the wilderness for 40 years 38 years about the time that we come to this place here Numbers chapter 22 it had been 38 years that they had been wandering in the wilderness and wandering in the desert why because they rejected God at Cades barnea terrible mistake that they had made they had made this awful mistake there at Cades barnea and so this challenge that's facing Israel at this juncture in The Exodus is a type of where we are now you can see this and brother Mam's going to identify this here in a moment and God identifying himself by his characteristics so I want you to think the challenge that Israel faced with Moab being a type of the church and with Jericho or the promised land just being there beyond the Jordan River it's a type of where we are as the bride today brother says and God identifying himself by his characteristics he says now up there I want you to notice these two nations in contrast here was is Israel and and I have it there in Brackets because I believe he says Egypt but he we know that he's referring to Israel a little scattered about no Nation to go to no Executives or no king or nothing or any dignitaries among them just a people on their road to a Promised Land This is the bride now he say look at them a little scattered about no Nation to go to no Executives or King nothing no dignitaries among them brother Braham said Moab had celebrities they had their Fighters they had their kings but here's just the people on their road to a promised land and they had to go through the land of Moab it was right in the line of Promise so in order to get to where they were going they were going to have to go through Moab now he says in paragraph 47 two Nations at contrast a very perfect example of the day we are living if we had time to go into it notice God doing this in Parable that we find out paralleling so this is Brother Bram saying that where Israel came to where you had Israel as a nation which is a typee of the Bride you had Moab as a nation which is a type of a church and he says it's a perfect example of the day that we're living in and he says if he had time to go into it oh he's saying we have more time to go into this we could go into more detail and we have time to go into it we have time to take the things that brother brandham said as brother Bram says God condenses his truths as brother brandham said that I'm just hitting the highlights then this is what brother Ram did he hit the highlights he con God condensed his truths and then we can as men of God take these truths that brother Brandon preached and unpack them if you hit the highlights we can go in and we can get into the details and the and and all the points that brother Bron was referring to when he hit the high points he says this is the very perfect example of the day we're living in notice God doing this in parallel we find out or Parable paralleling so this is a parallel for us I want you to take it that way that this is that Israel at this juncture represents the Bri of Christ Moab represents the church and so Moab becomes part of Israel's last hurdle in everything that they've been through getting out of Egypt and all the mighty Wonders that God did in getting them out of Egypt and that maybe it culminated in them getting to cross the Red Sea and then they enter into the the Wilderness and God sends them mana and God sends them quail and God identifies himself in a pillar of fire and a cloud and God is evidently with them and it says that none of their shoes wore out and God fed them and sustained them and they go over into the uh in the promised land they come back with the evidence of the fruits there's a lot of things that's been taking place they reject God at cadis Baria that generation that rejected them have to die out 38 years later now they find themselves just at the doorstep as it says on this side Jordan by Jericho and they still have another challenge they still have another hurdle to be to get over before crossing the Jordan and I'm going to be able to just use some real summary language in in this because I know that you've heard these things in great detail but it's here that Moab tries to tempt Israel and in doing so they're wanting the attempt is to cause her to fall and if she can fall then she fails to follow all the word of God they there was a there was an effort to stop her from entering into the promised land and we know that balam was a prophet uh in Moab and he was a prophet which is uh Bao reaches out to and we'll go into just a little bit of the detail on that but uh and how many of you familiar with balum and the in the scripture maybe if you're not sure quite sure who balum is he's the one whose donkey talked to him and so immediately we all oh that guy uh but and I'm just going to use this as summary and get into a little bit more detail balum was paid to curse Israel but what happened every time he went to curse him he blessed him there actually Baum that we quoted a coule coup Services ago where he actually cursed Moab that go there's going to be a scepter come out of Jacob and he's going to rule and Reign and righteous going to Smite the corners of Moab and this is coming from balb who is hired by the king of Moab to curse Israel but when he opens his mouth he can't curse him I the blessings come forward and because he can't curse them by prophecy because he can't bring a word of God against them because Israel's right in line with the word of God because he can't curse them directly he tries a more subtle tactic to stumble Israel so remember brother Bram said this types exactly where we're living today he says a perfect example the day we're living in here's the parallel so there's a parallel to us how Satan is going to try to get a little bit more clever and the tactics of the moabites are going to be a little bit less direct because they can't use the word of God to curse you so what are they going to have to do something a little bit more indirect and brother bradam goes into detail in this and you could certainly kind of take it from the scripture as you get into the book of uh Joshua you find that there was H that the report of Israel had gone ahead of them and there were those in Jericho who had heard about the mighty works that God was doing in Israel so God was identifying himself with Israel their Mighty Works were being shown they had just kicked out this king of the ammonites where in this land that had been taken away from the moabites so God was identifying himself with Israel and Israel approached BAC was terrified of her it wasn't like oh isn't this neat our long lost little sisters come back home and how can we provide for you and these are well-watered planes and we can give you cattle and do you need a do you need someone to look after your your sheep for you can we re refresh you in any way no there was uh there was no uh there this was there was not a welcome party for Israel as brother Bram uh puts it this way he refers to how and I know in Judges chapter 13 the scripture talks about how they sent emissaries forward and asked the king of Edom can we have passage and they asked about the mobites can you let us through can we pass through and they refused it we don't want to give you any food we don't want to give you safe passage we don't want to help you brother mam says it was too risky are you listening all right wake up your neighbor if you're up in the front row I'll wake you up my if you don't have someone next to you I'll wake you up he says it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd this is moab's way of thinking this is a moabi approach to this situation is well I don't want to help it all because if I do what if some people follow him what if some people don't want to live in Moab anymore and they end up going to the promised land and so this is the attitude and the mindset for Bayo Bao is afraid it be too risky to be neutral be too risky to show support he might lose some of his crowd so Bayo hires balum to curse Israel so what is this Spirit now that's on the king of Moab what's the spirit that's even o on balam what's the spirit that's on Moab it'll always fight against the elect it's the spirit of the natural church it's the spirit of politics it's the spirit of of of of a carnal religion that actually resist and fights against the elect of God now before you start trying to think outside yourself start thinking about how you will wrestle within yourself to be more political to to to to be more pleasing to other people to kind of fit a particular IDE ology to look a certain way to live a certain way and to fit in a certain way and you have a political bone inside of you that wants to do it one way but you got a soul inside of you says no you got to die out you got to go all in you got to serve God the right way you've got to do it the right way and you can't compromise and we have a flesh which is a moabitas flesh that wants to cause us to compromise and that's where we start and examine ourselves how that we have a mechanism within ourselves that's afraid to give all of ourselves to God because it's too risky amen that that's what we're looking at we're not think we're not thinking outside of ourselves tonight we're thinking about ourselves even thinking about us as a church that we should never be afraid to follow God's word and support the right thing because oh we're afraid that we'll lose part of the crowd says he might lose some of his crowd it was too risky well this could we don't ever want a church to begin to compromise so we can make the crowd bigger and not lose anyone and then within ourselves as we're examining ourselves it's a spirit that fights against this elect seed on the inside of us now I want to look at three scriptures fairly quickly that refer to balum in the New Testament and and I'm wanting just to I I felt that at the very least if we don't amplify them very much tonight at the very least it's identifying how that the spirit that existed in Moab expressed in the relationship between bik and balum and how balum set out to curse Israel and ultimately tried to stumble her that the writers in the new test identified this as still a spirit that fights against the church and brother bam says this is a perfect example where we are today paralleling well the writers in the New Testament second Peter chapter 2:15 Peter is identifying this way of B saying it exists today it exists within the church he says which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray and I know I'm kind of chopping off some of the thought here but these are those Who Fallen away from the faith and have forsaken the truth following the way of balum the son of basor who love the wages of unrighteousness the way of balam the son of and the word that's used there is the son of carnality balam was carnal in his approach and they followed the way of balam who loved the phrase here is important to note the wages of unrighteousness the benefit or the reward that he would get from doing what he knew is against God's word so it's called the way of balum it's it's a way of thinking a way of acting it's a particular influence the wrong kind of influence wrong kind of carnal thinking it's a son of carnality we don't even have to related it to demon possession it's just a carnal way of enjoying what the wrong thing can bring us instead of the sacrifice of doing the right thing following the way of balam then in Jude 11 woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the heir of balam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of Kora quite a mouthful that Jude uses he has the way of Cain the gaining of Kora and then in between those being the bread this is the meat of his rebuke sandwich they ran greedily after the heir of balum for reward what is it referring to a covetousness he coveted after he ran greeted he coveted something he coveted a position he coveted power B coveted the crowd uh The Prestige the politics all the things that kind of tickle the ear a and suit someone's fancy and floats their boat and oh this is what makes me feel good this is what will make us look good it's catering to the wrong thing and so here's Peter Jude they're identifying a spirit in a way of thinking in a way of acting in a way of existing within the economy of God or against the economy of God within the Christian church so brother bam says that it's a a paralleling and it's a perfect example of the day we're living in this is this has been a type that's been used since the beginning of the church now in Revelations chap 2:14 as a rebuke is being is given to the church in Revelations chapter 2 and it's in the uh the rebuke of the pergamus church and you'll find that it's in the pergami and church age that brother banam Church age book chapter five of the church age book where brother B really amplifies I'd actually encourage you to go it's around Pages 205 or so for a few pages brother just goes detailed into this story it's where he says it was too risky he might lose some of his crowd go into great detail about this attitude of balum and bik and so here's Christ now speaking to the church at pergamus but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum so it has been identified as the way of balum the heir of balum now it's the doctrine of balum and the scripture itself speaks to it this way who taught B to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed un idols and to commit fornication so this is the doctrine of bam the way of bam the error of balam manifested it in this Dynamic that he taught Balo something and what he taught Bao to do was to cause Israel to stumble to cast a stumbling block in front of Israel unable to use the word of God against Israel directly by saying the word of God says this and God curses you and a and to try to cause confusion about the word of God unable to do that he caused them to stumble against the word of God and force God to deal with Israel by the word so instead of causing them confusion on the word or actually causing them to be cursed by the word he wants to actually put a stumbling block before them to cause the word to deal with them so balum taught Balo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel in numbers Chap 31:16 and I I really I really appreciate the presence that's being U established here this evening through your attentiveness I I I just really like this because there's a there's a patience on my part just to just to lay these things out there uh though they might not be expounded upon in great detail or it may not be in a dynamic manner these things are kind of being set before you now in numbers 31:16 this is going to give us a little bit more insight into the doctrine of balam who taught Bao to cast a stumbling block before CH before the children of Israel this is Moses speaking behold these caused the children of Israel through the Council of balum to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of peor we know about the Feast of B peor and so it these and he's referring to these and we'll see them in the scripture here in a moment he calls the children of Israel through the Council of balam so the Bible's telling us that balum not able to curse them by the word of God counsels bailo Bao and tells them well this is what you can do to hinder it this is what you can do to stumble this is what you might be able to do to bring a reproach so he counseled the counsel of balam which would be the heir of balam the way of balam the doctor of balam to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter pure and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord God sent a plague up upon Israel because they actually fell through this scheme in the Council of balum they were caused to commit trespass and a plague fell upon Israel and 24,000 people were killed so it's a very terrible time terrible day for Israel and so Moses reveals that balum counseled the midianites that's who these word he says it caused the these caused the children of Israel was actually the midianites that he had counseled the m minites to cause Israel to sin think about that Moab isn't innocent got to be more on your toes than you've ever been before so bam is I've been saying it over and over again powerless to curse Israel directly he's power hungry balam had been hired by bik uh to curse and so he wanted that check he wanted his paycheck he wanted to get what he was do by doing it so he was desperate and he was desperate he was hungry for recognition he was hungry for power and so balam was motivated son of carnality motivated for all the wrong reasons ran greedily HHH after the heir of balam for reward it is something that he was driven by driven by the crowd driven by pretense driven by power driven by politics and my you can get into this and you'll find that in the language that brother brandham uses and even in the very and I'm trying to stay away from the details of the story so that we don't get caught up in it I'm just wanting to use Moab as a type of what Ruth is called out of so without getting into too much of the detail of The Exodus which is not necessarily what we're typing and the specific details in those days in what Ruth has got to overcome she's got to overcome a land and a country that was known for was established in political pandering known for being power hungry known for being carnal and and he used what balam did is used Temptation and he used deceit to accomplish his objective when the word couldn't do it bam go and prophesy from God on behalf of God and curse the children of is the word's not going to curse the elect so what does it what does what does devil have the devil have to use deceit he has to use deceit to accomplish his objective and this is going to be seen in Numbers chapter 25 so we looked at Revelations 2 which tells us about the teaching B the doctr of bam that taught Bao then we see in numbers 31 how the counsel of balam was given now this is what we this is how where it actually happened in Numbers 22 they had come to the plains of Moab on the side Jordan by Jericho now this begins to happen after balum can't curse him balum finally gives counsel to BAC and in and the counsil is given to midianites and this is what happens this is the scriptures that describe it and Israel Abode in sheum and the people begin to commit whoredoms with the daughters of Moab now if you were just reading this chronologically you think well my isn't that awful Isn't that horrible but having read numbers 31 and having read re Revelations 2 we know why they did right it's not just oh they begin to commit whoredom they got impatient and oh something bad Happ no they were tricked there was an effort an an offense made it wasn't that it just kind of happened naturally if I could say it that way it wasn't like oh well it just kind of happened but rather balum taught Bic and they instructed the medidan the midianite women to to deceive and to trap Israel they said well how in the world we ever going to get to a place we can get the midianite women to to deceive these men of Israel we got to get together somehow we got to find a way where they can intermingle and they can mix and so the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab and they called The People Under The sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bow down to their gods and Israel joined himself with Bor and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel now we know by revelations 2 in numbers 31 that balum had a Doctrine had a teaching and had a counsel that succeeded in causing the women of Moab to intermingle with the men of Israel and then a way that influenced the men of Israel that they would be enticed to join with these Daughters of Moab and I want to use two different statements to make this point but I I want to kind of bring this out in preface it and and I I don't believe that I'm being uh unfair to do this but when you see how the prophet of God identifies balam's tactics and the pressure that worked upon the men of Israel you'll see that part of his tactic was to create a little bit of Shame within Israel to M to maybe begin to admire Moab a little bit my look at this we haven't eaten like this since we left Egypt look at what they have here look how awesome they're put together it was an effort to create a little bit of Shame by comparison maybe even for them to feel a little bit belittled and and there was a peer pressure that was being exerted to force a political compromise just a little bit of peer pressure just a little bit of force and a and a way to try to bring something to pass and cause something to be and and the way that this happens is can to be very very subtle but in order for balam to accomplish it he had to lift the wrong thing up and belittle the right thing and see if that would be just enough to get the men off center other because it's going to be the men it's the men that sinned as he says that the men begin to the the people begin to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab so you have the men now who are going to begin to mix with the wrong thing how is balam what was balam's counsel what was his Doctrine he had to teach the people to lift up the wrong thing and make it look great and make it look pretty and make it look pleasing but then at the same time you've got to draw the contrast to the to what their faith to you got to go draw contrast to what they're already married to you've got to belittle this other part because if they could take their eyes off the humble part they could take their eyes off the sweet part and get their eyes on the bigger part and the large part and this attractive part that's what you're going to need to do to cause these men to be distracted and fall you go ahead and use that however you want to in your own life but there's a dynamic there that the devil tries to use time and time again it's one of his calling cards it's one of his MOS it's one of his uh one of the ways you could tell oh this is part of his standard operating procedure now notice what brother bam says and it and knoweth it not this is Brother bam amplifying the tactic of balum look when them Israelite women with callous hands and hair stringing when then sons of God those sons of God come up through the land of Moab and met them dainty women with well set hair and fancy and a lot of manicure on their faces what is it he means I don't know if it's blush or I can't remember what it is he's usually trying to say I'm going to make the same mistake he does he says a lot of manicure on their faces or what you call it and when them sons of God saw those real fair women a false prophets said we're all the same and they married among them and God never did forgive them look at what brother brandom identifies is kind of like the contrast that causes them to to the success of the Feast of B peor he's saying that he was able to draw this contrast between these well set fancy a lot well put together a lot of makeup on their face Dy women's well set hair and that how awesome and attractive that looked versus what he said the callous hands of these Israelite women their stringy hair right think about it there was the these women had been traveling in the wilderness for over 40 years now they had been it been 40 years in the wilderness wondering around they they didn't have the luxury of hot baths they didn't have the luxury of being able to stock up on all the latest uh essential oils and they they had left their diffusers in Egypt right in Moab they had theirs running 24/7 and so here the Israelites come and they're not in dotera Young Living at all they don't even have any essential oils at all at their disposal pedicures that that was they gave those when they in Egypt that chance getting them now in the wilderness and now it's the the this beautiful moabit woman who is very attractive and then well look at this this uh worn out callous hand stringy hair of this Israelite woman bam saying that's the image that bam the comparison that balam was able to create now you got to be spiritual to understand how that this is a perfect example of the day we're living in and not just think about the women being the actual women of this world that are beautiful and scantily clad and present themselves in a seductive way to Men of God but also think how would this work on us as Believers both men and women how would this work on us as a church us as the bride we are a woman and us as a church we are a woman but now brother Rams talking about moabit which is a type of the church he's actually describing the church he's not just describing the women he's describing what way churches can look and well set and fancy and a lot of pretense and a lot of makeup a lot of wellp polished things up front what is it a lot a good light show a really good worship and everything looks good real on front but just strip that veneer away from some of these churches and get to the heart of the people and you'll find it can be very very ugly and the god of the this even age he uses the same exact phrasing again and these are used very near to each other just 5 days apart in August of 1965 he say just the same as balam's teaching that it caused the pretty intellectual scientific women a up with their flirty eyes her paints and powders her fine perfumes to entice the sons of God but it wasn't enough just to use the beauty to entice it had to be against something he said before it was their stringy hair and their calloused hands against their own women that worked and had calloused their hands with no makeup on if this doesn't Inspire us as men of God to be set for the defense of this bride if this doesn't Inspire us as a men of God within our own homes as husbands and fathers to defend our wives and our daughters and us as young men and youth groups to defend the virtue a and the Holiness o of the daughters of God and the young people in this church because they're laughed at they're mocked they're scorned they're belittled especially if they're not part of a big youth group or they don't have a particular way they don't drive the nice car they don't have all the nice fancy programs it's real easy for them to be condemned and laughed at and looked down upon and and balum was successful and getting being able to lift up the pretty intellectual scientific flirty eyes paints and powders fine perfumes to entice the sons of God against the women that worked callous their hands with no makeup on yeah to be more mindful to defend and to stand up for true virtue and Holiness and I think that we ought to look at this this positioning this Collision as brother bam calls it of not just the individual men of the of Israel when they met these beautiful women of Moab but also the how churches are today and how that we can use carnal judgments to assess things well the if I'm just putting together my my list and I'm I'm looking at things and who's blessed and what's the best thing to do and where's the best place to go and how how best should we do this and is God really blessing us well look at that group over there they they all they have is a hotel room that kicks them out whenever they want to that can't be of God right I'm try I'm wanting to encourage you a little bit I'm willing to State the obvious there's a way that the devil's going to try to work on you in your mind to belittle a church with callous hands and stringy hair a church with no permanent tent a church that hasn't been well established and it's not hasn't been long very been around for very there's a way that the world and the devil would try to belittle you and discourage you and try to get you to be against the small things and try to look for the big things but what we judge things by is the word since everybody thinks I'm a really really Bill I'm a billionaire lawyer if I finally decide to open up my billionaire trust fund and and and buy a a a half a billion dollar building and and and have everything in Gold and Everything perfect and it's 777 ft from the furthest part of the parking lot to the front door and it's seven steps from the office to the pulpit and then one last eighth step to really get behind it I mean and and everything's just laid that doesn't make us any more right doesn't make us any more spiritual that shouldn't make us any more secure and W well this must be a real legitimate Church church and this this could be a place that we could go to now that we have this multi-million dollar facility no it's not in that at all stay away from carnal judgments keep your eyes on the word because this the reverse is true sometimes people try to hide behind the humility hide behind poverty hide behind being bankrupt hide behind the fact that they don't do uh handle their finances well hide behind the fact that they've squandered a lot of giving and haven't handled the tithes and the offerings very well and they don't have very much they're always getting by and scraping by and there's not much to for and say well God's people have always dwelt behind tents and always really really humble and say well that's not what we judge it by we judge it by the word as Paul is teaching us on Sunday it's not whether you abstain from meats or eat meats that proves you before God we go by the word of God it's a word standard that we're using I don't have these statements to show you because they're just very very quick brother B says balum he succeeded in weakening Israel what did he do he weakened their Camp bam succeeded in doing it how did he do it by lifting up the carnal things to the degree that it caused the the the the spiritual beauty of Israel to fade and it was in that in that conflict that the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab brother B says a lot about the feast the Feast of Bel peor bam he succeeded in weakening Israel what did he do he weakened their Camp then brother bam says and it's in Phoenix that he says it he says but God he's referring to these very specific things but God rich in Mercy has pulled us out of that chaos and let us see it before the thing hit before the thing hits here isn't that beautiful he's pulled you out of the chaos this is what the message of the hour does this is what Naomi did with with Ruth so to speak pulled her out of the chaos this is what God's word the bread of life is doing for us pulls us out of the chaos and lets us see it before it hits here oh God let us see it before it hits let us let us see it on the horizon before it gets here let me see it coming up within my own heart let me see it when I begin to feel the pressure let me see it when the the conspiracy is engaged against me and the world is trying to lift up the dainty things of Moab and the intellectual scientific things the pretty things of Mo the flirty eyes the paints and powders the fine perfumes trying to entice me against the word of God pull me out of the chaos pull me out of the Temptation pull me out of the deception let me hold to this unpopular gospel let me cling to things that may not be pretty to the world but are beautiful in the eyes of God he's pulled us out of the chaos and he lets us see it before it hits that's the benefit of this message that's the benefit of keeping it before you you I had purposed in my heart before I started to preach I was ped the in the before I came out to encourage you to listen to the message of the hour listen to it listen to it if it's just a matter of not knowing what to listen to text me email me call me hit me on Snapchat whatever you need to do I will share with you a link I will get you an MP3 player I'll load it on your cell phone whatever you need to be able to listen to it you should be feeding on this message my my inspiration even looking at this in the beginning talking about being hungry is we've got to have a strong insatiable appetite for the word and only the word and that appetite's got to remain pure because we got to be feed on the pure word of God we can't be distracted from this we can't be pulled away eating on something else not going to produce the body change so we got to be feeding on the word of God and we've got to stay in the right thing feeding on the right thing and this is what this whole lesson of the bread of life bringing forth the bride the more you feed on this bread the more bride's coming out of you you want more bride to show feed on the bread it's the living bread of life bringing forth the bride you are everyone that I'm looking at tonight and preaching to tonight you are bride well brother Aaron go brother brm said that in every Church there's three kinds of Believers well that's why we're meeting in the hotel no I'm I'm not going to look at you tonight and say well yeah okay yeah and start telling who's make believer who's unbeliever I preach to Believers you are bride tonight and I'm wanting you to know the more bread you eat the more bride you become we must be feeding on the bread of Life feed on the word of God feed on the word of God listen to it digest it get into it hear that voice let that voice be familiar to you so that whenever the scientific moabit tries to come along and belittle this word you know too much about it to be deceived and that's our lesson in looking at this particular dynamic as brother bam says oh it parallels this is he says this is exactly a perfect example of the day we're living in these two Nations contrasted Moab the church the Israel the bride our lesson is leave Moab right that's the lesson leave Moab be washed of Moab get out of Moab break the habits of the Moab and stay with the word brother Bram says this in the chapter 5 of the church age book He's talking exactly about this pressure of balum and the sins that they committed here in numbers 25 he says when any man turns from the word of God and joins a church instead of receiving the spirit that man dies well what if we joined your church brother Aaron yep you'll die just the same well what if what if we join uh uh brother Tim PR's church and don't get the Holy Ghost die just the same but what if we join brother Danny Stan's Church and don't get the Holy Ghost those men of God will tell you die just the same that's why they continue to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost right because it's not just a matter of finding yourself within the four walls of a an organized church that believes the message or preaches mainstream message you've got it you can't turn away from the word of God and just join a church IT addresses the mindset of people that just want to take comfort in the structure the church order I mean do you realize that one of the things that drives people to just be told what tape to listen to and feel really good about just pushing play because you know the push play the obey part of pushing play is pushing play Push play and Obey is to push play obey by pushing play and that and that's what you do and PE it's very easy like okay that has simplified it to the point where I can do it and I feel good right I feel comfortable I feel safe in that and that's the mindset of the people but you've got to hear what's being said you've got to pursue this with everything that's in your heart you must be born again he says dead that is what he is don't join a church don't get into organization and get taken up with Creeds and tradition or anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or you are dead it's all over you're dead brother brandom this is formal writing you shouldn't be using conjunctions you shouldn't repeat yourself over and over again like that you're dead it's all over you're dead eternally separated from God this is what has happened in every age sense sense God delivers the people they come out by the blood Sanctified by the word walk through the waters of baptism and get filled with the spirit you can see this en type with the children of Israel but after a while the first love cools off and someone gets the idea that they ought to organize in order to preserve themselves and make a name for themselves maybe under the pretense of protecting the truth right maybe ba balam and Bao had an idea and they could say well we're just doing this because we this is what this is what God says and this is what this says and this is how we ought to do it and this is just the right thing to do and and had it all laid out just right but we know Bayo was doing it because it was too risky not to right we know his motives and reasons for doing it and after a while your first love cools off you get the idea you ought to organize to preserve yourself and make a name for yourself and they organiz organized themselves right back into the second generation sometimes even before then they no longer have the spirit of God just a form of of worship they are dead they have hybridized themselves with Creed and form and there is no life in them that's that's the death of Moab that's the danger of staying in Moab and and and and the as brother random emphasizes you could take this Spirit on so easy and not know it I share it to challenge us as a church very young in our Genesis that we don't make this mistake to where we organize to preserve ourselves to make a name for ourselves I preached for a church in Switzerland do you want to know its name I would too because it doesn't have one they never even gave their Church a name why they don't want it to become about the church so it's just the church with no name beautiful Church in a really beautiful part of the world outside of Zurich but they haven't given themselves a name ow that that that in itself doesn't make them right but wonderful congregation love the word have a wonderful pastor but what happens if you organize yourself make a name for yourself the danger is you lose the Zeal for God passion for his word you settle down the spirit leaves he says you just have a form of worship now when you say the form of worship it's not just a shadow of worship where people show up and like oh this church is dead no it can be very robust it can be very hot it can seem to be very passionate very thriving he says but they're dead why because they hybrid and it became Creeds it became carnal sons of carnality organization form but no life don't let it happen to this church if God would see fit that he would te the meeting in the air and we would not we would not translate for another 20 or 30 years he says even before the second generation they're dead may we not May regardless of how much time would pass may we always keep the word before us let's stand to our feet tonight Brothers if you could come the lesson is to get out of Moab and get into the message get out of Moab and stay with the word brother shared with me I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this but he he confessed just as of late that and he did it to a family member and he said I just want to apologize to you he said for my whole life he said I've I've been a really really good message believer but I haven't been a very good Christian what distinction was being made is the methods that we develop in the message to be message and to be faithful to that structure and that Dynamic but in doing that without the without the spirit of God all we're doing is we're lifting we're making a name for ourselves all we're doing is perpetuating organization we're just perpetuating structure we're just seeing making sure that things exist and succeed and that it has a has a pathway going forward but it's it's different when you're married to the word and you let the word have prence brother BR says that word this is in a chapter two of the church age book that word is never failed in the mouths of believing Christians I know it carries with it the image of it being put on your tongue in order to speak it but I want you to look at it as being put in your mouth to eat it never failed when you eat it and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride so right now tonight it's here stronger and greater than ever where in you in the bride stronger and greater than ever stronger and greater than ever oh brother Aaron that's in the church age book okay brother BR said it was his book stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority what is it that balum thought would be the kind of the Twist and the sting to cause Israel to stumble look at you with your callous hands and your stringy hair you're in the minority here how do you stack up against these other scientific intellectual pretty flirty paints and powders fine perfumes how do you stand up how do you line up to it saying Little Flock you little minority I love this is the true Prophet this is the rebuke to balum this is the rebuke to Bao this is the rebuke to the doctrine of balum the he of balam the way of balam this is the rebuke to the Council of balum this is a prophet a true prophet of God standing up to call us out of the chaos he says hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom Hold to this word fill your mouth with it eat it eat it fill your belly up with it eat it eat it and your heart with it and someday you'll cross over into that land someday you'll possess it stay with it with everything that's in you if God would leave lead us to go to verse three in the Book of Ruth we can begin to read how that they take their two sons ALC and Naomi into Moab and ALC died nothing but sorrow that awaited Naomi and Moab but then the two sons married two women of Moab doing this even with knowing that there's a consequence for doing this knowing even the history of what God had called him out of that even those two died and it describes Naomi being left without her sons without her husbands but then she hears that the Lord had visited her people in giving them bread and that's what brings Ruth out of Moab the visitation of the Lord let's bow our heads heavenly father if there is a roof in Moab tonight may she hear the voice of Revelations 18:4 calling her out of Babylon may she hear the invitation to flee from a moabit condition and come to a fountain come to a place where your bread is and be forever [Music] changed and also Lord may we who have heard this voice we who have set out in this journey we who have been P out of this chaos Lord we're thankful tonight we are so thankful tonight that this message has been preserved even as our brother Manuel expressed at our Men's breakfast how to hear it in English to understand it in English Lord what a precious privilege that is Lord may we be faithful to this message that we have a a greater desire to see that it's distributed to see that it reaches those who don't have it that we support missions and things that would get this word out because this is a true word this is a pure word that's going to call your daughter out of Moab and Lord as we we've arrived at this last juncture as we've arrived at this last place in this positioning here at the doorstep of a body change a wedding supper and a millennium we realize now that the bread of life is attacking and tearing down and destroying our Moab mindset and the modalities and the things that we've accepted and the ways that we've administered Justice and the way that we've tried to establish systems to persevere and to survive Lord we don't want to survive Leo deia we want to destroy it completely overthrow it we want to step outside of it we want to be changed so Lord may we not simply try to exist as a means of survival but Lord Thrive as a means of departure Lord may we accept and see so plainly that the Lord has visited your people and is giving us bread may it strengthen us and encourage us I pray in your precious name I ask that you would bless and touch your people tonight amen
