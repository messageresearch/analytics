TRANSCRIPT
========================================
going a step further this morning in the subject of the Kingdom looking at Heaven's mystery Earth's Glory you can already see some of those elements in this text and the scriptures that we just read this is the third part on worldly kingdoms and in looking at worldly kingdoms or wanting to identify the perversion that was sown into creation as we read here he says I created the earth I created man upon the Earth in the beginning God creates the heavens and the Earth and then kind of the culmination of God's creative process is the man and the woman framed there in God's Garden of delight God's pleasure garden and God creates that and so what we're looking at is how that perversion was sown into creation by the wicked one and brother Branham takes uh the the work of the wicked wood and identifies his power his sorcery as if we could say it that way and how that he doesn't have a seed of his own Satan does not have the power to bring forth life and so Satan has to work with something that God created did that would have the power to multiply or the power to replenish in order to have his own children to have his own seed or in order to have those that he could Reign Over and rule over because we identified how brother Brown said that Satan wants to enjoy man just like God does I said I want to be like the most high I want to rule over the stars of God so that's being Satan's ambition he couldn't create a people couldn't have his own creation he had to find a way to access a people and brother Benham uses the term poison and it's the best way to think about it how that it's something that poisoned what the original was when God's power to transform we may have read this Wednesday night he says but to make this point I want to I wanted to give you my analysis of what Satan done in Eden it's just a phrase he doesn't use very much but I love it that the prophet's going to analyze things and in this day of analytics I love to know that brother Branham we have a real scriptural prophetic analyst of things that Satan has done he says what Satan done in Eden sprayed horrible poison spray so he has to use the spray he can't create he has to use the spray in order to deform the original would you like to know what that spray was I can tell you I got the formula of it two words unbelief which is contrary to Faith sprayed unbelief doubt so notice the contrary nature that if there's Faith there's a there's something contrary and then this part to me is the widening of it and the the thinking about this and science filled its place so where poison corrupted something and created this cavity as he says where the cavity is that went into the seed so the seed's been deformed it created the space it hollowed something out Satan filled that cavity with knowledge and Science and civilization and it's deformed the whole entire creation of God now I'll make this point at this point that this is something that doesn't happen immediately in the moment but it's been sewn into creation and at a week in humanity and defile it and bring it low and so it the what began in Eve's mind and then begins to work its way in the natural it creates this vacuum and Science and knowledge fills its place and he's using this analysis for us to think about well what did Satan do this is what he did he sprayed a horrible poison spray and I just want to continue to amplify that image this morning I'm not going to go much further than just that that act of what Satan did in the beginning and so I I guess I'll say this but in doing that I don't want us to become experts on what Satan does even though to overcome is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks but it's better or it's even just if not more important to know that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and is already overcome him so we can have that confidence we can have that uh uh faith not in that oh I know the devil I figured him out I know some people have kind of bragged about oh I got the devil's number and bragged about how well they could defeat the Devil and how well they knew him and what they could stand in and they were standing on the wrong knowledge and fails we want the plan and purpose of God if I could say the kingdom to become plainer that's the part of I want this to become more evident to us is not so much uh the kingdoms of this world to be magnified but by the law of contrast by identifying what is the what are the worldly kingdoms we're understanding better what is our domain and what God has called us to be and so we're going to be diving uh deep today and and maybe just we're not going to cover much ground but maybe just drill down very deep so I trust that you'll be able to focus now we've been reading from Matthew chapter 13. I've been taking this uh the text that brother Branham took in the sermon seat of discrepancy and the parable of the wheat and tears as it's called is about God's planting he said the son of man or God's planting and brother Ben I'm even in relating to this Parable says the seed is the word of God so the parable of the wheat and tares is about God's planting but not just God's planting but Satan's perverting or his poison spray of unbelief and doubt and let's look at verse 27 as it said you know the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto this uh The Good Seed being sown but then the enemy comes and sows tears among the wheat uh and we've looked at what those tears are in detail and note this verse 27 to me is just a great point to ask using their question to build off this morning so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him because as the verse said that when the wheat sprung up so did the tares and said unto him sir if we could just put it in uh you know plain English you you planted good seed in your field right sir did this thou not not thou so good seed in thy field and it's just a rhetorical question because they don't wait for the answer but they said from Winston half the tears Lord I know that you sowed wheat you sowed good seed I know that you created and when you created you looked at creation and said uh this is good and this is very good and you had a lot of proclamations about it and you you felt a certain way about your creation and so Lord having to or to the the owner of the field the master the field or if you sowed good seed then why are there tears where did they come from and so when Jesus is using the parable and use it in a way of the Mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and speaking up as a parable to the public but it's given unto the disciples to know given unders to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God this Parable is raising the question and so he raises the question how did the tares get there but he's using the parable to ask the question uh but he's also answering the question of why there is wickedness in the world or why the world is wicked and we could look at it that way said this world is not my home and the things of the world and if you love the world and there's a lot of language that we use about the world uh that tells us well there is a world uh that is wicked and there's a world that's evil but then there's a world that God loves that he is acting to redeem and acting to save and that hearkens back to some of the things we took a lot of time on in preaching on uh God so loved the world and there was one who had visited and they heard one part of it and said that was a really really good sermon but we just I disagree with how he characterizes the world and I thought man if they only got my tapes they would have known that in the first three or four parts we used a lot of scriptures to try to explain that there's a world that God loves and there's a world that we're not to love and we can't love it and have the love of God in us so it's maybe it's a little bit of semantics but it helps us to understand there's a correct kind of love there's a wrong kind of love and there's a kind direct kind of object of that love and there's a way that that love is projected to things that aren't in the images they ought to be and so he this is helping to and I love how Jesus does it because everyone's maybe asking well why is there evil in this world and why is there Darkness everywhere everywhere instead of Jesus just answering the question he uses the parable to raise it why are there Wicked people why why is there evil why are there all these things and he's answering the question and his answers in verse 28 an enemy hath done this he's telling us the enemy have done this and he tells us later that the uh the tares are sown by the wicked one and so if I could say this as my summary and or and then I want to just prove this by the word of God God allowed Satan to pervert the kingdom and God allowed Satan to bring forth worldly kingdoms and and so I'm saying that he allowed it and and now maybe for my job now is to prove that by the word of God now in the sermon um see the discrepancy brother banham is teaching us that the tares are seeds of discrepancy sown by Satan so that's how brother Ram is characterizing the tares that are sown into the world he calls them seed the seed of discrepancy he says Satan sowed his seed from the beginning when God placed his first harvest of human beings upon the Earth so isn't that a beautiful characterization God sowed brought forth human beings pure humans Adam and the woman and then Satan sowed his seed the seed of discrepancy from the beginning after God had brought forth humanity and so I believe that this characterization by Brother Branham calling it a seat of discrepancy and this emphasis that he gives it is very important to catch because the same thing in the power of transformation God's power to transform he's wanting us to recognize what Satan does to pervert in order to produce his quote-unquote religious beautiful kingdom remember that's where he works it says oh spiritual wickedness and high places and we think oh the the agenda of the homosexuals and the agenda of the Satanist and if you're not watching out for the Illuminati you're going to miss it when in reality all that is probably just a red herring right it's just trying to distract us where where Satan is is in presenting himself as a messenger of light and an angel of Light and very religious and Polished and quoting the scripture and quoting the word and so when brother bam calls it a seed of discrepancy that is an important emphasis for us to catch and he defines it he's actually using Webster to Define it it means sewing Discord or being contrary he says as Webster says so in a Discord something different or being contrary to what's already been so this is to me it's just helped me so much as a Christian and and recognizing the heart of God and recognizing things that uh oppose the things of God but notice that it's not just a difference but it's a contradiction so you could have something that's different than the other uh but it's it's not a contradiction it's just different you could have sweet and sour right and in that if something's sweet and something sour you say well those those are just different and maybe they're opposites but this is just not a difference this is a contradiction and God we know is a god of variety but not a god of variance God Is Not A sower of Confusion And so his brother Ram defines it from Webster Webster says discrepancy is a conflict or variation as between facts figures or claims so a seated discrepancy is not oh well God sows a human and Satan sows this and and they're just different Satan so something that's against or contrary to the original and so that's that if you could think of it that way that what Satan is trying to accomplish not just something different because I mean if being different was wrong then come on some of us would be in a lot of trouble but it's not God's got a variety and he likes differences in different natures and temperaments and abilities and callings and so God has has a variety but he's not there's not a variance within it to where well I'm this way by the grace of God and you just have to deal with it and and well I'm this way by the grace of God and you're really going to have to deal with it and we just Embrace differences and we Embrace people are different but if it's contrary to the word of God if contrary one to another you say well that that's not the very that's not the variety that God's wanting to achieve so looking at it in the sense of not just being different but at variance or contradiction as President says that's important to recognize and and I'm going to begin to leave the thought in the seat of discrepancy uh because there's just so much depth there I want to give some more time to it that's the see the the stairs are the seed of discrepancy a contradiction not just a difference because the serpent was different than the man in the original but what what Satan does and brings forth is a contradiction to the original word so as we look at it in terms of good seed according to the parable that's sown by God that's just that's righteous that's pure even if there's a there's variety but The Bad Seed is sown by the wicked one and that's contrary uh as it as the parable tells us it's offensive it's against the kingdom of God and now God's original seed was by the spoken word God speaks the word and even if we say in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that's some that's some thought taking shape some thought taking form and we had God creates by the spoken word he sows his seed by the spoken word we know the depth and the message of the hour according to that so then Satan the wicked one his discrepancied seed is by lies so God we say God's spoken word is truth God's not speaking the word and and lying about it and that's kind of what Satan implies a little bit to the woman and says well God doth no yeah yeah right he's trying to kind of create this confusion this poison spray of unbelief and doubt and so Satan sows The Bad Seed the poison or uh the the what produces the tares he sows it by lies it says in Genesis 3 4 and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die that's a seated discrepancy why it's not just it's not something different where God says this in one place and says this and another says well that seems to be different and somehow someway they dovetail or they they match or they balance out they're from different perspectives as Paul says you're justified by faith James says by works when we think well that's a contradiction no that's just different perspectives that that depends on your Vantage Point and so here this is not something that says well we're just all looking at the mountain from different perspectives I'm looking at a mountain and and Satan's saying no that's not a mountain that's a canyon right that's not a different that's not a different perspective he's turned it upside down he says you shall not die and so this is the contradiction this is the discrepancy and so his lie then to the woman he sows that poison spray into the woman's mind and that lie led to an act that produced the tares in the world to understand that the tares being the mixed seed the mimic weed not pure human but not pure serpent it's just drawing that straight from the message of the hour so that brings us uh that can take us to the spoken word versus the spoken lie you have the spoken word you have the spoken lie but this is that this is now uh I want to make this statement correctly because my whole everything hinges on this moment so if it fails we can maybe go to lunch early because it's we're going to be wasting our time if I fumble this one a lie cannot exist on its own a lie a lie cannot it cannot just be alive I said well this is a lie you have to kind of you need some context okay what what makes it a lie sometimes we're asked a question and it contains five different assumptions and you really can't answer it without identifying the assumptions and what you I can't answer that because you've asked me several different things and the one phrase and if I answer yes or no I validate all the assumptions that are baked into the question and so one way if you're ever being deposed and you don't like the question you're asking there's really not a good way to answer it just say I'm sorry could you repeat the question you do that enough times opposing counsel is going to change the question enough to where it's safe to answer so the LA a lie does not exist on its own in other words it's dependent upon truth and that interesting way to think about it that when Satan goes to speak a Lie the original had to exist first so he could know how to contradict it so it's not like go ahead Satan tell us your story he's like well can he go first because I don't have anything original and and I don't want to be like a blind squirrel that finds a nut every once in a while and actually say something true so you go ahead and whatever you say I'm going to say the opposite now in the sermon God's power to transform again we'll just read from two different places that are pretty near to each other he says God is the Fountain of all Grace and Power again think a lie is dependent upon truth truth has to exist first before there can be a lie or if I could say this a lie only exists as a consequence of Truth and is not an original God is the Fountain of all Grace and power and of all Divine wisdom is in God so therefore knowing that he is the only Creator there is you thought you were going to be done hearing it last week I'm going to keep saying it over and over again there's none other Creator but God Satan cannot create where are we at on that number 19 at all he only perverts what's been created but God is the only creator so Satan cannot create only God can create uh 20 so paragraphs later he says now after it's all so well and set in order this is in the beginning after God created God felt sure now that this would be all right and then when he did then came in the enemy the enemy have done this he says and I'm going to call this fellow with power not to create again but he had power to deform not transform so when something is up changing and and there's some some transition that takes place you say oh well that's that's transformation this is this is uh a positive development this is good well no only God transforms to the kingdom Satan deforms uh to to his kingdoms so he says I'm going to call him a deformer now anything deformed is taken from its original state there's something that's gone wrong with it so there's something original that God has created and that's the material that Satan has to work with because he can't just create a deformity he has to take the original and find one way to change it or pervert it so the two powers in the beginning the power to create uh which we say would be Faith or the power to deform which is doubt and unbelief those are the two powers that exist faith and unbelief and doubt now I think that's sufficient there to kind of bring just kind of get was just set Satan right here and he's on trial right now and he's kind of twisting a little bit and this is what we're looking at is Satan in the beginning so turn to Ezekiel 28. let's catch the nature of the sower of the tares because God wants us to know God wants us to know these things now this is describing Lucifer we've read in Isaiah 14 uh We've read in different places that recognize his ambition but notice this further characterization of Satan so that we can understand what this power to deform is Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set these so so God did this that's what's on upon the holy mountain of God that has walked up and down to the midst of the stones of fire think of this characterization of him that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee been reading a lot of the the Jewish history and the oral tradition about the creation and about Lucifer and what he would have been walking on and even the reasons why this was iniquity was found in him whether it had been and some right that he was he became jealous of creation became jealous of the very thing that God was creating that in some way he began to recognize the position and power of Michael a record recognized some vacuum or some place that God was feeling and so he had this ambition to have that and so he gets jealous of what God is doing and that's that's where it begins and so God's describing Lucifer the anointed cherub that covereth it says that he was made with tablets and he was made beautiful and and it says you were perfect the day you were created till iniquity was found in thee remember how brother Brown emphasizes over and over again sin did not begin on Earth it began in heaven and we're all like what right like how can that even be but if you could just to help us out a little bit God dwells alone all there is is God he feels there's no time or space it's just God so then when God creates and I I need to be I don't want to open up a door to some of these really awesome things on Elohim and now God takes that form then as he begins to create space in which he works and he creates Angels that's where sin began not in God but in what he's formed and brought forth and what he begins to create says I created you he created Lucifer the son of the Mormon the anoint of Cherub and so this is where sin begins you were perfect till iniquity was found in thee billabam says in the sermon and uh who can remarry did you know Satan was co-equal with God one day sure was all but a creator do I have to explain it for our visitors in the sermon marriage and divorce did you know Satan was co-equal with God one day sure he was all but a Creator he was everything stood at the right hand of God in the heavens the great leading cherubim so if he's equal with God in every respect and I'll read some more statements to this effect if he's equal to God in every respect except the power to create he had the power of self-will he has the power to choose so he is created he has every Power he can except the ability to create now think of how beautiful it is that if you have uh faith right and if deity is in you you've got power to create another world and go live on it amen no wonder no wonder Satan hated us right you mean you're going to give them what you need but he has full complete equality with God except the power to create and so he has this is I believe this is a direct implication what brother I'm saying he can choose his own way but he can't create his own way he can choose he can Rebel he can disagree and it's even something uh that we're quite honest about in our own family as we talk and as we grow and as I I don't know anything and my teenagers know everything uh that it's okay to disagree that's disagreements are expected and they're understood and so Satan had the power to disagree and I guess the distinction would be I'm certainly not God and so there's certain there's room to have a difference of opinion in our household but when it comes to God everything he says is truth everything he does is just but Satan had the ability the power of self-will Billy Ram says it again in the Seal of the Antichrist the right man hand man of the almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a co-worker partly equal with him only Satan could not create so again remember that just as man was given free moral agency there is a Freemore agency when it comes to Angels he's given this to Satan has a he's co-equaled with God and God has a will God has a desire God can choose God can create Satan is the same in every respect except he does not have power to create God is the only Creator but Satan took something that God created and perverted it back into something else eval and now notice when Cain and Abel very beautiful picture of it and I I left this in there because now notice how he projects forward Cain and Abel was nothing more than the pre-figure of Judas and Jesus was God not God was aiming to something right and and God was uh he was doing something in a way and brother loyal used a military term this morning on not being outflanked and so God was doing something and the devil was pursuing hard after it right well what was God doing little head fake right goes this way and the devil's like all in and where does he end up Judas and Jesus he says that this is the prefigure of it and so these are the seeds in the beginning that and their manifestation in the days of Christ and I'm wanting to get there in detail uh eventually so now you see the seed in the beginning produced an Abel and a cane and then we see it he says that's the pre-figure of Jesus and Judas so the the the point I wanted to build on now is Satan is equal with God except the power to create and that and he had the power of self-will so now as it says you were perfect until iniquity was found in thee let's watch this iniquity and Luke chapter 10 verses 17 to 20. it says the seventy returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name so there's the power of the name of Jesus they recognize that devils are subject to this name why because this is on a higher order all right Satan can work within Humanity but now the name of Jesus evokes deity a new creation a new power the kingdom that's greater than all the kingdoms of this world and so they are subject to it just as Adam in the beginning was given dominion over All Flesh now the name of Jesus speaks of a kingdom that's greater than nature and greater than time greater than science greater than uh the laws of nature here they are casting out demons and the the response I want to read the whole response to verse 20. he says I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven now catch that image I beheld Satan falling from Heaven as lightning or as lightning fall from Heaven now that's an interesting point to make but he says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and now he's connecting as I see Satan fall he says I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions so now that the sting and the nastiness and the evil and over all the power of the enemy Satan has fallen out of Heaven he gives us the image of the serpent and scorpions and he says now I've given you power over all the giving you power over all the power of the enemy this is what you've been given you power over it by my name you're giving power so he's wanting to see that in View and nothing shall by any means hurt you but he says not we're standing in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice Now Catch the contrast Satan is falling from Heaven he says Rejoice because your names are written in heaven so one has left his place one remains Satan is cast out of heaven but your names are in heaven so he's saying there's a greater representation don't just get all excited about what you could conjure up here on Earth and what you can do here on Earth and Cashing Out devils and speaking with tongues and all these different things he said I've given you that power it's the power that's in the name and and a lot of people can use it be saying the greatest thing is to happen all that your name your name is written in heaven like that that that's the point that he's saying this is what matters and Jesus then is contrasting different kingdoms he's identifying the kingdom of heaven and what we ought to rejoice in and worldly kingdoms and the whole and he's and I believe that the way he says this is all we're Cashing Out Devils or cash out Devils he wants to bring into view the entire economy of evil the serpents the Scorpions the the things that hurt and offend the Devils the spirits this entire economy of evil is tied to Satan falling from heaven behold I behold held Satan as lightning fall from Heaven remember in Isaiah 14 12 how about fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning you are fallen from Heaven the scripture tell us Lucifer motivated by pride and by lust for power he chooses of his own self-will to pervert righteousness let's just read it in Revelations chapter 12 verses 3 4 5 and then verse 9 and there's a lot of there's a lot of detail here a lot of depth in this he says and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and be held Behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads I said dragons aren't necessarily the cute cuddly things that we might think they are I think the whole uh babylon's book is How to Train Your Dragons nothing against it just just know a lot of people are squirming or laughing right now says so now notice what this great red dragon does and his tell Drew the third part of the stars of Heaven that notice the power that he has in his tail his tell Drew the third part of the stars of heaven and it casts them to the Earth and we know brother Branham tells us that it's the third part of the stars of heaven or a third of the angels fall or he gets them to rebel against Michael has told you the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the Earth the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born we see this image in Christ brother Brown relates it to the days of Herod and the slaughter of the the children two and under and she brought forth a man-child this is many to agree this is Christ who was to rule all nations with the rod of iron this is the Messiah the Jews were expecting day one it says and her child was caught up unto God into his throne so even though they try to try to kill him and Vanquish them he's caught up to God and he doesn't rule with the rod of iron but this Christ that comes forth and you can see those types tracking in that language so then it says in verse 9 and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called The Devil in Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him brother bam says Satan and his satanic religion are represented in the Great Dragon Satan in his satanic religion and in a in heaven if I could just put it this way I'm not going to put a period on this on the other application to this but in heaven Satan Lucifer Rebels against God's Kingdom he Rebels against the order he Rebels against the word and iniquity is found in him and he's he causes a third of the angels to fall and what God does is he cast him he's going to cast him to Earth I beheld Satan Fall Out of Heaven down to earth now watch this and I let your light so shine before men I want you to see that brother bam taught this and did you know the devil lives in class this isn't an argument against going to school he's talking about Society class right he says do you know what caused the first battle in heaven was when Lucifer set up a great class of people got a better class of angels He thought a big bigger Kingdom a more brighter shinier Kingdom than Michael had I can do this better all this power and potential that exists up here why don't we do this veteran I look at this and we ought to be flashy ought to be bigger ought to be brighter and he was kicked out of heaven so this is I'm always recognize saying that Lucifer was kicked out of heaven here's Heaven here's a domain and a realm that God has created that's invisible and he's cast out of that domain to the Earth he says and he was kicked out of heaven so where class comes where class comes from stay away from class again children we're talking about Prestige and social standing and I love this the hungry don't want class the hungry wants food yes sir the cold wants fire not a picture a fire and the hungering thirsting for God wants the gospel and power of Jesus Christ amen no matter how simple it is how unpopular it is with the world they want reality recognize how the devil can only offer things that look good but never satisfy it may bells and whistles and a lot of amenities but it's never going to satisfy that Soul thirst it's never going to give you what you need to overcome it may give you things to pretend you fit but it's not going to give you things to where you belong and are satisfied and I love how he says the hungry don't want class Hallelujah if you're not hungry you'll take class but if you're hungry you don't want class you want food Hallelujah so now just this is just skimming here quickly so when iniquities found in heaven it can't stay there so God cast iniquity Out of Heaven down to earth iniquities found well there can't be a rebellion in heaven and God like well I'll just draw a bigger Circle right God says oh okay you want to rebel he cast them down to earth because in John 1 5 God had God first John 1 5. this with God there cannot be evil he said this is the message we've heard from the beginning of declaring to you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all so this Darkness could not exist with God this Darkness as this iniquity is found it causes this rebellion and trying to remember who it was I was fellowshiping with the son it was always my my father-in-law brother John Martin we are fellowshipping on things and it just struck me as he was sharing some things that Satan in the beginning or before the beginning in heaven when iniquities found in him and he begins to have this of his own will begin to disagree and and maybe begin this rebellion and this dragon is using his tail to cause a third of the angels to fall is it possible that he thought well if he's God how am I getting away with this right how come in the moment the moment I thought it I just right it just disappear so he begins to get lifted up in the fact that God's letting him get away with it and this is what you got to be careful we could we can do things and do things and do things and do things and do things I feel like lightning hasn't struck yet hey everything seems to be holding together pretty good and you think you're getting away with it and you're not and this is how this is why how the devil has the capacity to deceive the whole world is because he's deceived himself first the best kind of liars are the ones that believe their own lie right they're drunk on their own crown and they believe it I remember one time we met this guy and he told such outlandish lies that you'd be a fool not to believe him he's like nobody would say their dad is flying here right now in a helicopter to hand a certified check for a million dollars because you're like man I'm listening for blades right because your gig is up in about 15 minutes if not 15 days like what happened to the helicopter well he got stuck in traffic all right I mean it's like your gig's up but somebody who really believes it will tell lies and that's what makes them convincing because they've somehow convinced themselves Justified of the veracity of it become very very convincing and usually give a lot of details to it when they do so and so this is Satan is now beginning to work and thinks he's maybe getting away with it but God has a plan to deal with it he's just got to let it he's got to let it manifest in Genesis 1 2 now God had a plan this is he said that God had a plan and he said well where did these things line up uh you know it's kind of hard to tell which comes first but we know what was at one point he says and God in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth in verse two and the Earth was without form and void in darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters so now this image I beheld Satan fall from Heaven is lightning oh Lucifer how I thought fallen from heaven and so there's this image of not just him rebelling but even this image of him brothers and him being cast to Earth so at some point after iniquity has been found in them God then whether the iniquities found after the Heaven and Earth in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth and then Satan Rebels and then he's cast to Earth or there's this Rebellion then God creates however you'd want to line it up in your chronology we see that the Earth is without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep now this is a very contrary existence Jeremiah 4 23 I behold the Earth and low and it's using this to describe even the condition of Jerusalem it was without form and void and the heavens they had no light so God in the being creates Heaven and Earth but now there is if I could say this if but momentarily God creates the heavens and the Earth if just temporarily or for a moment it exists as the exact opposite of the kingdom of in the Kingdom which is invisible in heaven so you have God in whom there is no Darkness you have this Kingdom of Heaven this Dimension where Elohim and his angels and whatever whatever levels of the heavens you might have but we would recognize this that's light and and that's power and that's Beauty and that's all that's good and then whenever iniquity is found in Lucifer and he causes the third of the angels to Rebel that they're cast down to earth and then as God describes his first description after creating the heavens and the Earth there is a characterism of its without form and void darkness is on the face of the deep and then Jeremiah says the Earth is without form and void this emptiness uh and what it represents and and there's a lot of verbiage we could give to it a lot of amplification to these terms but it says in the heavens or dark the firmaments above the things that would be part of the creation Heaven and Earth being one creation and so in this moment with all its mass of chaos and uh turbidity and and everything without shape and all the darkness it exists as an opposite to heaven right where there's order there's light there's God now in this opposite chaos no form no or order and then in Job 1 7 I'm just using this to make a point about Satan being cast down to earth and the Lord said unto Satan with camisole then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the Earth and walking up and down in it so what does this tell us this is where Satan has been cast when Satan is cast out of Heaven he comes to Earth and here he is entrenched in darkness now project a little bit when God cast him down to earth Satan might have been like oh this is this is my permanent Dwelling Place This Is My Punishment this is my Purgatory this is my eternal hell maybe the terms that we would use and God's casting to him down to that but that's where God cast Satan and All His angels and so darkness and Chaos become Satan's dwelling it's the realm that God relegates sin because God has a plan as soon as there's iniquity in heaven God cast it down to earth it's now with this great mass of chaos and darkness this is where Satan is walking upon the void and everything that's without form and this is where Satan's dwelling so it's the nature of Satan to walk upon this Earth is even said in First Peter 5 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary of the devil as a Roy in line walketh about seeking whom he may devour but now he's in his own Eden I'm just I wanted to fast forward a little bit so that we don't lose track of what I'm the points I'm trying to make but if I said so Lucifer is on Earth today trying to work in the church to accomplish the same person purpose that he started before the foundation of the world he's still in the world today trying to work the same purpose that he started with in heaven to have a better Kingdom a brighter Kingdom in the sermon Oneness brother man says what is Satan anything contrary to the word he doesn't have salvation he doesn't have light his kingdom is Darkness the end thereof is death darkness and death is Satan's kingdom brother Brandon repeat it again what is Satan's kingdom anything contrary to the word so when Satan is in heaven and iniquity is found in him and he causes the third of the angels to rebel against Michael God cast them down to Earth but remember that's not God just dealing with it I said all right we're done don't have to worry about him this is his sandbox let him have fun God wants to deal with iniquity because God's purpose even for the Earth hasn't even begun to unfold we know the purpose that he created the Earth for but now recognize this nature of Satan as God is even foreshadowing the very beginning the Earth is without form and void it's chaotic it's dark there's no darkness in God but now there's Darkness upon Earth and that's where he put Satan that's where he's dwelling in anything contrary to the word is Satan's kingdom and his kingdom is darkness and death all right are you together with me to this point now in this the sermon job preached in Phoenix he says you know the old argument is like some of the unemployed are like I need to listen to that in the Book of Job and the sermon job he says you know the old argument is and come on haven't we thought this why couldn't God have bypassed all this and not had any of it why why create an angel that could choose oh why give it enough time given enough time is there not a war of attrition and one who's uh has self-will and given enough billions of years I mean that's what the scientists are banking on when it comes to uh evolution is I've given seven billion years I mean it's just conceivable that a single cell organism is going to go into us you know Buy cell whatever they call it you know it's a double sell uh amoeba like hey I know my language isn't right there but anyways neither is their reasoning they say well just given enough time you know something's gonna mess up and so there's he's saying well why couldn't God just put all of this you know could you kept this from happening but God now notice where he goes to answer this but God putting Satan almost co-equal with him Satan taking the things of God and perverting them into the evil thoughts and through there begin to pervert things into evil instead of good so in order for Satan to make evil he had to start with good couldn't organically create good God makes them co-equal someone said God couldn't God bypass all this and where do we where do we go if we have a time machine where do we travel back to to try to stop all this and he said well you'd have to go back when he created Lucifer you're like well man time travel is one thing right how do I go there so he says Satan was almost co-equal with him now this is a part where I hope to get some momentum and just to the end and as soon as the first thing was done now Satan self-will is going to Rebel in heaven soon as the first thing was done out of his great treasure chest of love he had a Plan of Redemption that quick because it's already in him so he's saying as soon as Satan did what he did and again this attacks The Narrative that God was responding to Satan all right there's a chess board set up and they're up there and Satan makes a move and God's like whoa that's a new opening hey and he's got to think about his next move as we said before God set up the pieces and walked away right because the devil's going going to the other side right and he thinks he thinks he's got I I got control of the board I'm going to win this no Donald he's gonna put himself in check hey how did this happen how did this happen so God immediately that quick had a plan all this is so good didn't have to sit down and think it all over how would it be he was God infinite he knew how it'd be he had it in his heart his great heart how he would bring all this about and then if he fore knew the church for a new Christ four knew the plan and set it all in order and the world turning around if I just pause on that when Satan rebelled in the beginning God didn't have a backup plan this was part of his plan and he he had a way of allowing by those who by self-will will reject him he would it first begins in heaven he says I've created something oh I think this is just so beautiful he creates an earth without form and void and he cast Satan and his demons into the Earth because he wants to use that to deal with him says oh my these created the Earth to deal with Satan he's decreed that created the Earth to destroy Satan well not just that he created the Earth to get a bride out of him and what a beautiful story he's going to get a bride out of it and she's the one that puts him under her feet Hallelujah and she fulfills kind of that final blow of Prophecy to place him under our feet in this end time culmination of Genesis 3 15. so God he says and notice how he empathize and you being dead to yourself dead in Christ and Alive After You're Dead Yourself alive in Christ God's work in all things together for the good to them that love him and how can you lose [Music] you just can't lose there's no way of losing Hallelujah you know how they say show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser I bet we don't want to be sore losers but he says you can't lose there's no way of losing why because God had a plan in his heart the threefold purpose of Christ and and this they think of this mystery that God had in his heart so then when Satan does this he says he had out of the treasure chest of his love he had a Plan of Redemption because he said he had it in his heart already God didn't go digging around in the treasure chest and say well how do I deal with Rebellion right he's not like gossip whenever something happens in our home we're like what do you do with this how do you do that I've never heard of this before how do you resp wait you said what I don't even know what to say to that right there's things that we don't know what to do we call upon God for wisdom God help us we get ourselves into situations and what do we ask for wisdom wisdom Lord how should I respond how should I act what's the right thing to do and we TR I trust your travilion that I hope that there's some sort of healthy suspicion of some of our first instincts right until his Instinct becomes first nature now when you say wait a minute is that of the Lord is this right is this scripture but God didn't have to do that he didn't say well I ought to uh you know what never mind let me go back let me cool out time out right Satan you go to your room I'm going to talk about this me and Michael need to talk mother Michael and I are going to discuss this figure out what your punishment's going to be but he doesn't do that he already has a plan so then God only allows something to happen that fits his plan Brothers as all things work together for the good in other words doesn't matter what the ingredients are God won't let anything be put in the mixing bowl that he can't use to make good so as soon as the devil goes to throw something in he'll go no not that double pick gotta say yeah that's fine hey and the devil thinks he got one over on him oh he has no idea and God's other going yeah whatever you have no idea because everything you put in that is an ingredient I can use for good all of it the devil's all they're just dumping things in complexes abuse some scars and this and that and I'm putting it in there God's like yeah okay and there's oh yeah you like that watch this just dumping it all in there and God said and as soon as the devil goes to do something say no you believe God does that for you I hope you do I hope you believe that God's watching out on the ingredients of your life and the ingredients of your spirit and listen this it's the confidence he wants to give us that if he allowed it no matter what it is if he allowed it he's saying if you'll surrender it to me I can use it because nothing happens unless I can use it and the Very things that might be working hard against us are the things that we haven't yet surrendered for him to use Hallelujah he had a plan from the beginning and when Satan did this he says God in his heart already had a Plan of Redemption so look at here in Isaiah 45 5-7 I am the Lord there's none else there's no God beside me I girded Thee thou has not known though thou has not known me that thou may know from the rising of the son and from the West oh my that there is none beside me I am the Lord and there's none else now this speaks of what God allows to fulfill his purpose and plan he says I form the light which means to predestinate or ordain and create Darkness that's the fashion or accomplish it so he says I notice he forms light he predestinates and ordains it but then he uses Darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things amen so from this we see and I there's more that we could get into on this and I'm sorry if I keep hinting that I can get deeper man he's the most simple uh preacher we know who's always threatening to go deep hey it's like I just don't have the arm for it you know you know it's like let him do the fly route I'm just going to dump it off to the back on a swing round he says light so now light he forms light and he and he makes peace and the Darkness is created so light and peace these are if I can say this these are his eternal attributes these are Eternal attributes and darkness and evil then are only contrast to his glory now if I could even say this about I the Lord I make peace and create evil it's not it's not moral evil he's talking about he's some of the bad things that happen because it's he's talking about I'm the Lord I form the light and create Darkness I make peace and create evil he says I only allow it to fulfill my purpose but remember in the sermon sir we sir as we would see Jesus God's alone in creation the devil cannot create if you say the devil can heal then you make him a Creator then he's co-equal with God only God Only God Alone can create now this is this is at the heart of understanding what this poison spray is the material that Satan has to work with and how that if that a lie only exists in the context of Truth so he says the devil can only pervert what's already created what is unrighteousness it's righteousness perverted you get it righteousness perverted it's right for man to live to take his wife and be a husband and wife to live that way you know what he's meaning but what some other woman would could do the same act and it would be righteousness perverted which would be sin everything the devil can do is to pervert what God has created you get it so God Alone now he's talking about healing God Alone can develop cells that can heal he's the only healer for he's the only Creator God Alone Is A Healer now this is what strikes me in that God Alone can create the only thing the devil can do is pervert but God's A Healer so he's not going to create sickness but there's an enemy that'll take health and pervert it to sickness and that gives God an opportunity to be a Healer remember how we emphasize that if Adam had only known the Garden of Eden he could have known the creation really really well but he would have never known the Creator very well how do you remained in Eden without a fall there would be so much of God hidden behind the veil all the presence would be nice the fellowship would be sweet but God would be walking with him saying Adam if you only knew if you only knew how much I loved you if you only knew how much you mean to me if you only knew how much this Earth and creation meant to me and the only way the only way that he could ever know how much it meant is if something happened to it right there's people that we think are right we're like this right and then all of a sudden something happens and everybody's running away and like bro what's up hey where are you going this is the time I need your friendship see ya right the kids are saying these days it's kind of a call back you know Sia wouldn't want to beat you especially not in that condition and they're all running out right and you know your true friends are the ones that are running in bumping off all the ones are running away from you what do you need and they want to help you and that's what God wanted to be right he said you know you don't have a clue Adam of all that I am because in this he's saying that God creates Satan perverts and righteousness so evil is good mixed that's how you get evil lost my brother I just couldn't take took these out put them back into about put it again just going back and forth and felt unstable how many times I did it but it says the law in law having a shadow I want you just to catch this God created you to be perfect and Satan perverted you to imperfect God allow you to be your wife's sweetheart legally married but to love someone else is to pervert that true love that you should have for your own wife Satan does that where does it come from Satan does it does he create it no he perverts something he perverts the original in the sermon Faith say Satan perverts what God has made he made you to be a son or daughter to him and Satan perverted you Satan perverts what God has made and he made you to be a son of daughter to him and Satan perverted you changed your way of thinking change your mind change your appetite change your desire so sometimes these very things that maybe we lean on is this is who I am this is my personality oh God if it's not what you want me to be change me because God made me to be a Son of God but it's Satan that perverts my thinking changes my mind my appetite my desire God made me to be perfect but Satan's perverted me to imperfect the reason why I come a sinner the reason why I'm here Satan's done this and enemy's done this Hallelujah I'll try to go quickly in John chapter 9 verses one to three and Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth now I want us to relate this to the image of all Humanity the image of us who was to be perfect but we're born imperfect God gave you eyes to see but you're born blind he gave your heart to feel and it's born callous all these different things that maybe we could say about the condition of humanity and notice the response of his disciples verse two master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind all right we want to know why your life's the way that it is and we want to know why because they they have some idea especially in the law of consequence right and sins visiting successive generations and so their thought about this man's blindness is oh what did they do to get cursed so did the did the man did he sin uh he's blind from birth right I mean what kind of Hellion was he in the womb right he's born did this man sin or did his parents they said that he was born blind your question doesn't even make sense did this man sin all right I guess he could speak to by foreknowledge God knew you're going to steal the cookie out of the cookie jar so he smites you blind before you even born and so you break the cookie jar in the process he's trying to steal a cookie he says master who did the did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind now think about how we rationalize sin we we're all Sinners and we've done this we've done bad and the consequence of sin and Satan's done this and all these things have happened Jesus answer says neither hath this man sinned nor his parents I mean let's not look at his this is a curse he's not blind because of punishment he didn't say anything about us we were born in this world as sinners right because of one man's disobedient sin is passed on we're all Sinners because of the Fall not of our own choice right we're born Sinners we're born uh uh estranged from God we as the Bible says and brother man who brings for different places you know we're strange from the womb and we we comes with the nature to speak lies this is the condition of man when he's born and he's like well was that my fault I mean there there's even people now who are suing their parents because they didn't give consent to be born lawyers but he says this man hasn't sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him about this for a moment why all the evil why all the sin why does it why is this age as wicked as it is why is there adultery why is there murder why is there hatred why is there jealousy why is there depression an enemy's done this why is there cancer why is there other diabetes and migraines and Crohn's disease why are all these maladies and these sicknesses In the Flesh why are they there an enemy's done this why are there tears in this world when God planted good seed why well the enemy's done this an enemy's done this and then in John 11 after Lazarus had died all your your friends died he's dead and Jesus says this sickness is not unto death this sickness isn't for death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby are you are you recognizing now can you put the pieces together why is there all this wickedness in the world why are things the way they are well yeah the enemy's done this but God in the beginning had a plan he said well what there's murder and there's malice and there's this and there's that oh yes it's evil it's wickedness but those are all opportunities for the work of God to be made manifest my prayer is where there's hurt where there's a fence where there's woundings where there's betrayal where there's the shedding of blood may have been opportunity for the work of God to be made manifest in me where there's loss may be an opportunity for gain where they're suffering may be an opportunity for Glory this sickness is not unto death but that the glory of God might be made manifest Brother Brad I'm in the sermon I know says and remember no matter how great the distress is Satan cannot take your your life until God is finished with you now we believe that right we absolutely believe that now let's just back up to the billion foot view of creation and he says there is nothing can happen to you unless God permits it there's no evil can come unless God permits it God could have stopped the iniquity and Lucifer's heart in the beginning but God permitted it God could have stopped them in the garden but God permitted it there's a lot of things God could have stopped he says and it's for your good he's working that he's only allotted for his glory he's only allotted for your good man Hallelujah God in the beginning knew exactly what he was doing the devil didn't get one over on them and God's not counting on his ability to make up the the distance in the last the last lap right all right because remember this Satan's racing himself God's played it all out there now I'm going to read a lengthy statement here we're just to write about an hour in preaching I want to read this lengthy statement because I used all this this morning to amplify this statement I wanted when we read this statement and it's entered into our hearts and we understand even if we don't understand all the ways that it works we just accept the Paradox of this truth that this is what God did he says but that life you talk about eternal life that life could not and would not be shared with any other than through the way of God manifest in the flesh remember God reserved that right alone to himself Satan wanted it but Satan can't do it so Satan had to create a hybrid creature had to use the serpent and create a hybrid that's how the devil enters Into the Heart of Judas why because that's the fruit of the seat of discrepancy in the beginning but God comes to dwell in his son because he's the fruit of the seed in the beginning of the Tree of Life and so this is God this modeling that brother Brown's showing us that this life cannot be shared except through God manifest In the Flesh not just a Son of God but the Son of God perfectly United with his son god with his son he said this was part of his eternal and predestinated purpose this plan which is the thing that God had in the beginning when Satan rebelled in heaven this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the Plan of Redemption now as we emphasized before it's not that Redemption is the goal it's that the word cannot be defeated so there must be Redemption Redemption is an absolute because the word cannot fail so that's the plan of redemption is not that oh I I want to redeem it's like what I want I will have therefore no matter what happens there's a law of redemption that'll bring it back this it says it was the Plan of Salvation now listen closely God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being I know you know this we quote it we understand it we believe it but I hope that today what we've done is we're just placing this piece of the puzzle in this much broader picture just this one alone this morning it says in a period and this isn't the only one this is just the way of as we said before that I I'm not explaining truth we're just making observations about the word we're sharing with you what the word has already said these things in there and the the you you don't want an explanation you want the revelation of the observation so he says God it was necessary to predestin a man that required salvation being a savior he had to have someone who sinned in order to satisfy that purpose so the nature and character of God required that there be a a fall he said there's this is he says this is 100 correct and multitudes of scriptures bear it out as does the very pointed verse of Romans 11 36 I'm telling you this is the way the brother bam uses this blows my mind for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen and this verse supports the proposition that God being a savior it was necessary that man be a sinner because it was for him through him and to him are all things to give him glory to whom be glory forever amen he says man could not directly come in partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden in other words God would not permit it that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first so when God said in the beginning bar the way to the tree of lifeless man partake of it he says because I I have this has to come in flesh first but before God could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and Save man had to fall the fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Satan had to come through flesh also but Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the Fallen but there was an animal the serpent so close to man that Satan could get to that beast and through the Beast he could get to the human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race That's what Satan does in the beginning then even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like unto his glorified one thus what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan God had a plan I'm gonna deal with this I'm going to address this I and and this the and I I guess I'll say this because we're wanting to look and I think some of you've been doing this studying the sermon future home and listening to what brother Bama had to say in that sermon about the Earth being renewed and being an eternal attribute of God and that we're going to live and Reign on this Earth forever in the Eighth Day good the New Jerusalem is going to come back and settle on this renewed Earth and the annihilation is not like what we think Annihilation is why because purpose original right and everything that's going to be destroyed is a lie in anything that offends and so there this is I'll just kind of solve this seed out there that's why hell cannot be eternal and so now when God has created aloud to this to happen he said what he worked out in the garden was his predestinated plan and when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden he says certainly not it wasn't time Satan did what God when Satan worked out that which was necessary I hope you can recognize this in the scripture in the word of God now if I could just fast forward for a moment it was then that Satan works out now which is necessary in the Garden of Eden and then now think about Christ because he brought death on creation and now here's Christ who under the threat of death is trying to be is trying to uh forfeit his sonship and then we if I could say this on the cross Satan worked out that which was necessary because Jesus said to the pilot a pilot says in John 19 uh speak thou not unto me you know he's keeping his mouth shut no it's not thou not that I have power to crucify thee and a power to release thee and Jesus answered there could be no you could not have any power at all against me except that we're given thee from above did not say all power is given into my hands John 17 he has this power it's in his hands and so he's saying ah you say you have power to crucify me but he says you could have no power against me except it be given from above and isn't it beautiful that Jesus had to exercise self-will to accept God's plan he had to use and and win the battle and the mind and accept not my will be done but thy will be done to win the battle of the will to win the battle that was in heaven he's now wanted on Earth there and the dark chaotic time there in the garden but remember he said the spirit of God had left him there he is he's wrestling it out in that Humanity he's wrestling out within himself and he's saying no I will take God's way and so he could stand there before Pilate and say you don't have power to take my life I've got power to lay it down and take it up again and that power has been given to me by God so you exercise no power then that which God will allow to fulfill his great purpose so even in the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ when Satan had done that which was necessary for the plan of God why the Jews have a saying strength from below strength from the earth depends upon the strength from above it could have no strength except the heavens allow it so Isaiah 45 8. drop down ye heavens from above let the skies pour down righteousness go ahead musicians if you could come now and then notice this Heavens Heaven's opening up and righteousness has fallen this is let Earth open these are the seeds already sown into the Earth and let them bring forth salvation who are they them having an earth working together this this is redemption let righteousness spring up together I the Lord have created it Satan has deformed the world into his own Eden enter Eden of chaos and Eden of death and he's he's walking upon it now saying this is my creation this is what I have done and he's brought it right back into the state it was in the beginning without form and void Darkness upon the face of the deep we say oh no no no this is look at this is the glory of laodicea this is the most powerful the humanities ever been this look at the science look at the advancements but it is the brother bam takes it Genesis 1 in Revelations 3. takes the condition of man in Genesis 3 and goes to Revelations 3. he's saying look at this naked blind naked wretched miserable don't know it darkness is upon the face of the Earth the Bible says in your Earth was without form I want you to catch this image of Eden the the Earth was without form and void Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters every seed is already laying out there and it says he says and God said let there be light and there was light what the Mist the fog darkness is separate and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and I just began to meditate on this last week how their Satan in darkness and chaos and also in the Wind and maybe the wind is moving and the Earth is shaking and there's things that are belching and then God speaks with a still Small Voice and light comes and Satan is watching everything transform around him and here he is moving to and fro maybe walking about even on the stones of fire upon the Earth in this molten lava and this chaos and this murky mod upon the Earth and nothing without distinction and now the light is coming in Satan is witnessing all this and as it's been created he's there dwelling in this as the Earth is being formed and light is coming from he's dwelling in this darkness and brother Bradham says in the rising of the Sun God had a reason to do that for down beneath the water there were seed that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to live God had placed the seeds there in the earth and no matter how much Satan was there say no I want the chaos I want the darkness the demons love this this is what we like he knew God was speaking and there was nothing Satan could do to keep those seeds from coming forth there was nothing he can do to stop the spoken word from manifesting then and there's nothing he can do now to stop it from manifesting even though this may be his Eden just as he couldn't stop it in Genesis 1. he cannot stop it in the end brother Madam said and I believe that we are now living in that hour again that when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the world that the light may be manifested that's what God is doing and again it's the word of God say let there be light and where is the light you're holding it the seed has already been sown into the Earth and God is driving away by his word all the Mist all the darkness all the scars all the chaos he said come out of her come out of her I say Lord let this Earth open up let this Earth open up and let righteousness come from it let there let the skies pour down and the former Lottery Let it bring down let this Earth open up brother Branham says in this Fellowship by Redemption I they didn't use these slides but this is such a beautiful if you could just maybe focus on the words now he says when God made the first man he made the heavens and earth and when God stood back on the old creation and looked at it he didn't look upon it to judge it he looked upon it if I could even interject this this is me speaking for those who are listening on the podcast brother brother bear says he's looking at it God knew what what it would be he knew what would happen right and yet he doesn't judge it he says it's good he looked upon and said how good it is he admired it oh my you see it he looked and saw how good it was everything was perfect the trees and every the man of the woman it was all perfect and then he says it's very good but now Satan perverted that remember how we read the statement when brother Brown said you can't lose the God works all things together for good you can't lose he says Satan perverted that but if God could not condemn his first creation how much more is it impossible for him to condemn his second creation when you are created Anew in Christ Jesus Hallelujah if God would not condemn the first creation but he had a plan immediately to redeem it I believe God wants to Anchor you so deep in his love that as New Creations in Christ Jesus you will not live in fear you will not live in doubt that you will let these poison seeds of unbelief and doubt and say I have been inoculated against the spray if God would not condemn the first creation would he not preserve you those of the new creation those of you who are one as Christ was one oh Hallelujah God you're redeeming Me Lord just as you did the Earth just as you did not forsake the first creation but you had a plan I was a part of that plan all along and I believe you can have confidence today that no matter how ugly this world gets and no matter how bad your life may seem God has a plan of redemption for you you must you must anchor yourself in that you must believe that no matter what it is hey if I could if I could write this down and give it to you to say to me I need it this morning that I could look in the face of things and look right at the ugliest thing I could possibly think of and say Lord even in this there's good even in this hurt even in this pain even in this disagreement even in this uh the backsliding the Rebellion even in the separation even in the harm that I don't have to conjure up well this is the way that it has to end to be good I don't need to try to figure out my own ending listen as we read it brother Brown says well couldn't have God bypassed all of this could you imagine the disciples saying ha you sowed the Masters labor say well we know you sowed good seed what are with all the tears and they find out he allowed that what I'm not working for him anymore right like the but you have to recognize it God knows what he's doing so we read in Isaiah you're the one that's formed are you going to argue with him are you the one that's going to form say to the maker you have no hands it's about trusting God and we can come to the place to believe that I know I know is his son I know as his daughter that though if I hurt though if I'm rejected though if I'm sick it doesn't matter in the face of anything the devil can do God will only allow us to fulfill his purpose God will use it for good and be able to look in the face of anything and say I will serve God until the very end I will trust him into the Varian well what if it ends this way what if it ends that way God's the one that looks out after the end to be sure that it delivers what he desires and therefore I will live it until the end whatever that end may be conduct myself appropriately knowing knowing that God has a plan oh Hallelujah could you rise with me today
