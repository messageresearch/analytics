TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but uh if you could on this Wednesday night this midweek I know it may be difficult just focus some and I'd like to move quickly because I have a lot that's on my heart just not sure how much we could cover uh but I just feel uh pressed just to share some things tonight uh to you all that are here um and I know if you can catch it it'll be a blessing to you uh this is part four on the voice of mercy and I'd like to say this way that the the voice of Mercy or the voice of the mercy seat is in the bride today the bride under her messenger is the f voice to the final age that is if there's going to be anything spoken uh if in this last age if there's going to be anything lived out or declared it's going to be through his body because we are his body and his voice in Romans chapter 9: 23 just going to take some overlap from Sunday says and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory that is you those who have obtained mercy and have received Mercy you are vessel of Mercy you're not vessels of Wrath wherein the wrath of God is poured out upon those who reject him and they receive wrath and they become subject to it and receive that punishment of it we are on the contrary vessels of Mercy which God has prepared unto Glory a vessel of Mercy is a chosen instrument one that is going to be an instrument of Mercy or one who is an assistant in accomplishing mercy so I want you to think of it not just in terms of Mercy given and mercy received but that now you hold Mercy you are a vessel of Mercy therefore you are a container has anybody ever called you a container before you're a container you hold mercy and holding Mercy now you have something that you can give something that can be granted brother Bon makes this statement in the Statue of a perfect man he says the church is now supposed to be taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry that's quite a statement we are to be taking the place of Christ Paul said in Christ stead I I'm saying be reconciled to God so the church is to be taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also now notice the scripture he's referencing in John 14 says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world there it is carrying on his work so we know that the bride will finish uh in her Earthly Ministry the things that Christ did not finish in the days of his Earthly Ministry that we will finish the work that's what the bride is to do and is to accomplish and so we as he was an instrument of God's mercy and as he was uh declaring the father we have that calling today to carry on his ministry as he says carry on his work Romans 11:31 even so have these also now not believed so there's those that do not believe that through your mercy they also May obtain Mercy as vessels of Mercy that are continuing the work of Jesus Christ we must be merciful and in being merciful uh there's others that will likewise obtain Mercy through your mercy it's uh I guess there's uh I don't know why this comes in my mind but I'm sure we've all uh been pitched a pyramid scheme before and if you want to know what a Ponzi scheme what is a Ponzi scheme or what's a pyramid scheme is just ask yourself what happens if every everybody in the world participates what happens to the last guy right he has nobody to pitch it to he can't doesn't have a downline he's the end of the road and so the same thing with uh uh with if we had that kind of attitude towards the gospel oh we're we're this is it we're done nobody else nobody else can hear it nobody else is going to see it I'm not going to I'm not going to express this I'm not going to share this then it just ends it's over and so if we're not going to be merciful nobody's going to obtain Mercy I don't know how that connects with a pyramid SCH but we'll come back around it kids eat free and now in John 20: 23 we've been looking at the scripture personally as we've been studying and then we uh focused on a little bit on Sunday he's speaking to the believer now this is his commission to the disciples before the day of Pentecost and even in this particular instance this is him speaking you'll see it in Luke 24 here it's recounted in John 20 at the time of his resurrection and so he is resurrected he is the resur Ed Christ he is The Mercy Seat in plain view now he's revealed himself to the disciples after his resurrection and he's telling them that repentance and remission of sins must be preached in all the world and he says whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained and brother Bram said this is a commission to the church she is to do this now not in a Catholic sense but there is a way that this was accomplished and we saw brother brand giving us great detail in several statements on Sunday that the church has power to remit sins now that's significant it's scriptural now there's a way maybe we could twist that and turn it into something that is not as the Catholics have demonstrated but yet we know there is a truth to this that we should desire to be partakers of now in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 we'll pick up with verse 18 and I'll just read to verse 20 here says and all things are of God who hath re reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ so Christ has reconciled us to God and we having been reconciled to God we're new creatures in Christ Jesus and then as a part of this reconciliation what we're seeing then is Christ revealed himself to the disciples and he sat down he was communing with them it wasn't just fellowship and communion uh among them or between uh the disciple in Christ but Christ is going to speak to them and command them he says you go and whoever sins you remit they are remitted whichever sins are retained they are retained and so we've been reconciled to God by Jesus Christ the mercy seek and we have been given the ministry of reconciliation so it's not we haven't just been reconciled but being reconciled we become reconcilers and that word reconciliation is atonement I think of how deep that is he has given us the ministry of atonement this is uh the ability to to restore to favor to plate that wrath whatever we think of the atonement in the Old Testament says it's given us this ministry of reconciliation that was a symbol of reconciliation now we've been given the ministry of atonement to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them so there's the image of God in Christ through reconciling the world and hath committed unto us the word of atonement the word of reconciliation so this is we are not just under the atonement but now we have the ministry of atonement we have not just had our sins atoned for but we've been given the word of atonement so minister of reconciliation the word of reconciliation and now then we are ambassadors for Christ that we are his Representatives we are his body we are his voice and though God did beseech as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ's stead the church taking the place of Christ carried on his ministry in Christ dead be you reconciled to God so we have as Believers the ministry of atonement what and I'm going to take some scriptures here just to emphasize uh this through the Bible what this means if we have the ministry of atonement it is the voice of the blood speaking amen it is the voice of Mercy let's look at this ministry of atonement because if there's going to be atonement there has to be blood Leviticus 17:1 for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul now we know according to the Token that the life is in the blood and that the token is not the chemistry of the blood but we know the token is the life and so if blood's speaking it's not the chemical composition of the blood but it's life speaking it's what that life represents and here he's saying the life of the flesh is in the blood when this blood is shed and this life would expire through the giving of a sacrifice he says it's that blood because it symbolizes the life being given it makes an atonement for the soul amen so it's through the shedding of blood which speaks of a life that's what there there must be uh that is what's required for atonement in Hebrews chapter 9: 20 21 and 22 speaking about Moses Moses saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled the blood with both he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things by the law purged with blood almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there is no remission so there has to be a shedding of blood we see this in the mercy seat if there's no blood on The Mercy Seat it's only a judgment seat and as the blood upon The Mercy Seat that's where where God would commune that's where God would speak and it's saying that without the shedding of blood there is no remission without a witness or a Ministry of the blood there can be no forgiveness of sins there is no remitting so when we testify or when we were to preach if you're going to wanted to be one as you go out and the gospel be preached All Nations you have to be preaching Christ and it's not a dead Christ it's a resurrected Christ and it is a Ministry of the life or the blood that was shed whosoever sins you remit they are remitted without the shedding of blood there is no remission there is no atonement so we have been given a Ministry of the blood we've been given a Ministry of atonement Matthew chap 26: 28 Jesus when he's given the symbols of communion he says for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins so if there's if there's no blood there cannot be remission of sins there's no representation of that if there's no if there's no life speaking of the blood there can be no remission of sins now let's connect that with the idea that when the bride's gone there's no more salvation there's no more blood amen there's no more representation there's no more voice in the earth calling out uh to The Sinner for them to come under the atonement in Romans 3:25 so we noes the shedding of blood which is given for the remission of sins says whom God has set forth to be Christ to be a mercy seat or a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God so Christ is The Mercy Seat by faith in his blood and because there's blood it can declare his righteousness for the remission of sins I put that into this image of the church who's washed in his blood she is sinless she's going forth with the ministry of atonement therefore the sins you remit in order to be able to have this power to remit sins you must have identification with the blood there must be identification with Christ and I think the best way that I could just sum it up is go listen to the Token or token or a token there's different ways uh that it's titled so if you search the token you won't get all of them uh what I mean is you won't get them in the list of sermons so token a token the token you should pull up a few there four or five to listen to now I'm not I don't feel like I'm treading a fine line but I do recognize that for some uh this could be a controversial subject as I said before um I know many people that would say uh Mercy is in the bride they would go so far as to say The Mercy Seat is in the bride and there's others who would hear that and take great offense uh and feel that that's going too far and so I'm not necessarily calling out names or trying to pick a camp there but there's scarecrows and there's fanaticism and there's a lot of ways that these things can be twisted to where it's uh it's it can be presented as something that it's actually not but then there can also be a resistance to actually what it really is that there could be this reluctance well the the bride shouldn't be taken the bride can't take the place of Christ well true there's just actually no way to literally go back and pay the price and die on a cross and shed blood for sins we can't go back and be the historical Christ but we know we were in him and we know that today brother B said she is him that there's this Paradox of Oneness and this representation of Christ today where we are supposed to be carrying on his ministry and carrying on his work that we are to be vessels of Mercy that others who are not Believers that through our Mercy they can obtain mercy and that we must be fulfilling the scripture that says whosoever sins you remit they are remitted there there is a Ministry of atonement for us to continue to walk in amen now if that begins to build a picture it says well you're trying to make yourself out to be Christ himself the mercy seed and you're the bleeding bloody lamb uh well you know I don't think we even need to go there but brother Brenham says and the Mighty God unveiled before us he says and they say well you people try to take the place of God that's that sounds about it right he said that's not too far out that's exactly what it is that's exactly God manifested in flesh just as he promised well you try to take the place of God you try to you're making yourself out to be God you're making yourself out to be Christ and you're you're taking the place of Jesus and you're doing away with Jesus no we're just you should come into the place that Jesus but for you am you should stand with all that you can for that for who Christ is and what he did for you and he says well you're taking the place of God he said that's not too far out and I love that because it kind of implies it's not too far off and then he says that's exactly what it is amen and I'm reminded of how sometimes we can get very uh defensive of Christ and I know that I've expressed this illustration before but that we might take offense and be very zealous for Jesus Christ a and we draw our swords in defense of Christ just as Peter did there in the garden and it caused what did it cause it caused nothing but the shedding of blood incorrectly cut off a man's ear why he was zealous to defend Jesus Christ and and Jesus is saying you're an offense Peter because he says you'll never die and I'll never let this happen and far be it from me to let you die and he actually rebukes Peter and says this must be fulfilled so Peter in his Zeal to defend Jesus Christ was working against the word of God and we have to be careful that in our platitudes and the the the the lip service we want to pay to Jesus Christ and then well it's just all about Jesus and we just love Jesus that if you're not careful you can actually begin to tear him down in your defense of him because you're drawing the sword against the word today that's exactly what uh Peter was essentially doing in his Zeal but then it's also exactly what Paul was doing in defense of God a penos a zealot and he is actually persecuting Jesus so it's something to really consider how that there is a taking the place of Christ just as he promised now he's using this scripture he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also in John chap 14:2 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also that's he that believeth that's a very clear uh promise in the Bible and then this is a another promise and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father so he that believeth shall do the works that he does and then this declaration that because he goes to the father there'll be greater works and there is this is an end time there's an end time fulfillment in Prophecy to this I can take you through a number of different places there's several different places you go through brother bram's making uh comments on this scripture and he reads for John 14:12 in one place he says that great promise today he takes this in another place and he says John 14:12 his word that's promised for this day now regardless of how this was fulfilled in Prior ages and regardless of whether it was I I won't even say it hasn't been but I will say it's to be fulfilled today if it has before it's to be fulfilled today as well well yes sometimes we kind of make this uh we kind of have this exercise of trying to go and figure out what what has always been but I can say regardless of what has been it's for today that it must be fulfilled today as well and in the sermon there is a man here that can turn on the light which I think is a very important one in this this series that we've been talking about as far as from the absolute and the signs of judgment a and mercy says listen I want to just take you now and he says and let this be personal so we all want to take this personal look watch this he is the same yesterday today and forever his works that he did manifest itself now listen close when he stood there in John 14:12 he said the works that I do shall you do also greater than this shall you do for I go unto my father now he said it heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never fail now for at the last end of the age where are them Greater Works going to come know how he kind of says well then if we're there at the End of the Age if we're in the end time if we're at this very moment where everything's going to be sealed up and done and over if we're at the end of time where are those Greater Works going to come from and he says we are here there's uh there's a special application then of this a special manifestation of this something that Christ when he says in Greater work shall you do and and and I guess I I'll just say it this way it really is a paradox I mean how could you greater than what he did he says greater than these things shall you do because I go unto my father and there is this manifestation of this John 14:12 it's a promise today we want to get in the rhythm of the word for today to find the purpose of the word of God today where are those Greater Works going to come from because we're here so now I don't know if any of you went and listened to that day on Calvary and if you did you've already got these maybe you already have this come to your mind here brother asked the question what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that Son of God Can Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained now here's where the Catholic church and many of the others made their big mistake they go out and say I forgive your sins that wasn't it how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible pet Peter answered that question question on the day of Pentecost they said what can we do to be saved how can we get this that you all got he laid down the prescription he told them what to do he said repent every one of you towards God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what for the remission of sins there is the Greater Works now that's that that's a very specific emphasis that there's to to be a an ability in The Believer to he says to impart that eternal life to others he connects it with John 20:23 whosoever sends you remit they are remitted and he says well then how do we do it not by going around and blessing people and saying your sins are forgiven but by the word of reconciliation the ministry of atonement being preached being presented and that being received and with they follow the prescription they too would receive this baptism of the Holy Ghost they would have their sins remitted he says there's the Greater Works notice this is on the day of Pentecost so on the day of Pentecost there was tongues and there was shouting dancing there was a great enthusiasm but here's Peter standing up on the day of Pentecost as a Voice of Truth revealing Jesus Christ to be the Son of God and calling people to repentance we find that in the leod Dean age there was a great restoration of the gifts but this is what Peter's talking about here what brother Brown's poting out here about the great at works this isn't a restoration of gifts this is a book of Acts amen good this is the voice of Mercy at Pentecost if there's going to be a fullness of Pentecost restored if the church is going to come back to the church it was on the day of Pentecost well signs and wonders healings and manifestations and all sorts of gifts and miracles but there must also be a voice that speaks that brings people to the genuine atonement to the revelation of Jesus Christ and if that's missing it's all just for show good brother brandham it it I believe addresses that in this way continuing in that day on Calvary the greater Works were to have the power the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers amen I'm I'm not trying to explain this figure it out you know talking about how this works and how there's this uh this force field that you begin to enter into and but he's just he's bringing something for us to really consider I want us to give some real thought to these things and may not be putting it uh together well enough tonight or minister in a way to where your understanding will strike but hopefully Enough by putting it out there you'll just really think about it but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant he took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believer men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and inart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say to this sick woman laying here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but said greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever and this now I I realize that it reading these things and it's not necessar something brother Brown's always teaching and always detailing and so it just becomes real common for us to hear it this may seem to be somewhat of an outlier but I believe when you look at it in the P the the maybe in the context we've been building over the last several Services you can see wow there there there's something brother R was pointing us to something and and even as it relates to how he was calling out Leo deia and saying people don't recognize it today the Throne of God is in man and there was always this this correction to the church he does the same thing here he says which will uh but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that it's a sudden rebuke don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people again that's that's quite a statement and I know we we may want to use it kind of as like just a magic wand right like a I Dream of Genie or Bewitched or something just twinkle your nose or something a and be able to impart eternal life as some sort of uh magical power but yet we know the power is there through the right channel to impart eternal life to people brother says he's talking to the ministers and those out on the tapes he says what does Calvary mean to you what' that day do to you did it stuff you out with some theology did it make you a stuffed shirt or did it make you a Christian sold out sins remitted Greater Works than this shall you do you see where the where the yays are don't you Greater Works than this remitting sins in the name of Jesus Christ but through Creeds and denominations and so forth it's bound you down to a place you're still serving the world this bondage to the world he's saying that we ought to be doing Greater Works in the name of Jesus Christ but its Creed denominations have bound you down to a place you're still serving the world now if you could look at this in the premise as we mentioned Sunday what's the premise well there's this premise that denominationalism had become so bound up that Christ is kicked out of the church I'm going to make a statement there's no more life in there there's no more seed in there there's no more salvation in there that that's not where Christ has revealed himself he can't be found the voice of God is not in the organizations he's not in denominations and that's what represents this change so dramatically here in the end of time and that's the real premise of the message of the hour is that man has so bound Christ through Creeds and dogmas and he's saying that there's people who are so Bound by their denominational Creeds they can't bring people to Christ they only produce stillborn children there there's not sins aren't being remitted the word's not being preached the blood's not covering and brother bramman there's the rising of the sun this is a real important sermon I'll try to pull from here in a little bit he says and because I live you shall you live also and I live in you and the works that I do and brother brandom quotes John 14:12 The Works that I do I will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had dark a dark World theology world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light at the evening time it is the rising of the sun because I live ye shall live also quite a statement because I live you shall live also and Greater Works he brings John 14:12 and this end time there will be a resurrection in the evening time just as there was a resurrection there in John and as he's resurrected and he's communing he's feasting with the disciples he's commissioning them to go out and to finish this work and to meet on the day of Pentecost and the power of God's going to be out he says there'll be a resurrection in the evening time there will be light in the evening time there will be John 14:12 in this evening time Greater Works shall you do he says Greater Works in this remitting sins in the name of Jesus Christ now one of the sermons that we referenced in in this theme of the voice of Mercy is the Third Exodus I think there's a lot of themes there to draw on I had been uh there was a lot of things i' had been studying on in Exodus CH 12 and I wanted to bring a lot more things out in this but and I hope this isn't too much of a jump but I want you to see this in the Exodus in Exodus chapter 12 it's at a dark time it's a terrible time the time of signs and wonders it's a time of we can use as a type of the Rapture before they go and how the last plague that was going to hit Egypt was death and so if you weren't under the blood you're judged and so that's a great type for where we are today if you're not under the blood you're judged so there's Mercy in the blood there's Mercy in the atonement there's Mercy In following the instructions there's Mercy in gathering your place in that under the shelter of the blood and if you're outside the blood there's judgment and here it's expressed in the scripture in Exodus 12: 12 and 13 for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord so here's God going to be revealed himself in this dark time in this end time and he's revealed himself uh as judge Death Angel is going to pass through the land and he's going to judge the firstborn man and Beast throughout the land of Egypt and Against The Gods of Egypt he's executing judgment so in this time where God is executing judgment he had spoke to Moses and and instituted the Passover and he told them that they are to go and every man take a lamb according to their house and it said a lamb for a house and that if there was if it was too if family was too small that they were to come together they were to gather together and they were to take the blood of this lamb and they were to strike it on the doorpost and the lentil and they were to apply it and it was going to be an outward sign that they were inside eating the lamb as it had been prep they had been told to prepare it dressed as they were told to dress because they were going to eat in haste because the death angel was going to pass through and then they were going to go and so the blood was was going to be uh put on the doorpost and the lentil on the outside the blood was going to be placed there and it was going to be a sign everyone was going to see it it's going to be a visible token but it was not everybody who saw that was like oh wow they're going to live if they didn't know the word they just thought well that's a really weird display and this is what the scripture says in verse 13 and the blood the blood of this lamb shall be to you for a token of upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you it's the Feast of the Passover what was passing over judgment execution death he that believeth on me shall never die but is passed from Death un life that's what this Pascal lamb what that's what this Blood represents for us when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not come upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so there there was a time where uh things even in this Exodus as plagues were poured out and these different signs and wonders are taking place it came to a time and a terrible hour where you couldn't just rely on the fact that you had been in the church you couldn't just rely on the fact that you were on the right side you had been in Goan when this happened and you'd been over here when that happened and you had been protected from all these plagues there came a time where now finally you have to be under the blood and someone could say well I've I believe the message and I've been in it so far and you know the lice didn't get us and the frogs didn't get us and the that uh all these things didn't get us and we've been you remember when it was really really dark out there and our all the Egyptians were blind but we could see because we're we're Believers we're Israelites there came a time when you could no longer uh Bank on those prior experiences that God had been manifesting himself you had to be under the blood I want you to think of this in terms of the hour that we have arrived here in in the end times and brother bandam said those trinitarian brother Bram are those trinitarians are they going to go to hell he said I believe they're Christians but the hours approaching brother when they are sincerely wrong yes we see a similar pattern in the book of Exodus you could have been there all the way to chapter 12 and say well I've seen all the Miracles I've seen all the signs I believe Moses is a prophet and he said well you better listen to what he said you better you better hear what he said was so important in this end time and so important when judg was coming now this is just a small slice of this but listen and the when brother BR preaches token in Jeffersonville he said it was evening time when the token was required not in the morning not in the preparation the 14 days of the keeping of the Lamb Israel knew something was coming and now he brings it right to our day and I find myself um I feel that I just want to pause and try to think back to some of the sermons we preached recently where we're wanting you to see how that there was uh there was a manifestation in Luther and Wesley and on through the church ages and there was the the ignorance brother BR said God the Son of God interceding over the ignorance of the people and the hour approaching when they're sincerely wrong and so there's this point at which you come to the hour and time of redemption and that you can't be on the outside you've got to be on the inside and so brother he he transitions now to the church ages so did Luther know it know what there something was coming so did Wesley know it so did finny Knox Calvin know it this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar fired return back to the church they knew there would come a time that these things would happen but they didn't live to see it but they looked forward to see it Israel knew something was coming but it was in the evening time when that Lamb's blood the token was placed on the door so there this time finally when the blood has to be shed and it's this visible token a lot of a lot of Sy symbolism in that he says yet the lamb was already put up now this is to me it's brother using a language not to put us in a box or put God in a box and say well this is the only way to see it but to put it in a sense that we can understand how that we've arrived at a time in the end where God having had mercy throughout the church ages and it was still always the lamb always was The Mercy Seat but now the seals are are open it's not that there it's bloodless and there's no more Mercy but it's only found in one place cuz he says it was the lamb was already put up they put it up for 14 days and they kept it he says it's been the lamb all the way through it has to be Christ he said it was the lamb in Luther's time it was the lamb in Wesley's time but now is the token time that each house must be covered by the token amen each house of God must be covered by the token all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of God is the body of Jesus Christ and by one Spirit we're all baptized into this token and become a part of it that God said when I see this token displayed I will pass over you what an hour that we're now living it's always been the lamb it's always been Christ interceding it's always been Christ there H uh making an atonement and interceding but now something has transpired in this end time where it's the life the token life I I I just want to I want to leave it in these statements for you to chew on brother bam says therefore in the last days of Luther it was thought to believe in the days of Wesley the chemistry of the blood but this is the last day where the token is required and that makes together the whole unit for the rapture I believe that what he's looking at is we read the statement here in a moment is how that we're all working together and he quotes in Hebrews that they without us should not be made perfect and as Paul saw that they that had been in the Old Testament Church that they were not made perfect without those Jewish Believers receiving their Messiah brother BR brings it to a parallel to us and he says that they without us could not be made perfect that the New Testament foreshadow and the church ages foreshadow the coming of a Perfect Bride that is the climax of all the church of all the redeemed so where we are today in its uh very specific distinction is the token is required to make the whole unit for the Rapture he says and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of the holy spirit that the blood has been shed and that the Holy Ghost is upon the church without us then they cannot raise but they're depending on us God promised he would have it and somebody's going to be there I don't know who going to be but somebody's going to receive it God's promised this it's got to be there uh without us they cannot raise we say who's the US it's got to be somebody God they're depending on us God promised that he would have it somebody's going to be there I don't know who's going to be there but somebody's going to receive it the only one thing I'm responsible is to preach it it's God's business to look out for that predestinated seed there's going to be there though because they're going to be there each one of them one with the other the water age the blood age and now the token age of the Holy Ghost the token age of the Holy Ghost got to be he said has to be under the house of God is the body of Christ has to be under the token and brother brandham in that sermon he's preaching he says the blood of Jesus Christ cries out and he says but there's forgiveness in it if you'll just accept it so it's a voice of judgment the the blood of Jesus Christ cries out there's a voice of Mercy in this end time and maybe when you hear it it's condemning and it's accusatory and it speaks of punishment it speaks of death and it speaks of rejection but if you'll accept it there's forgiveness in it as brother bram's uh laying these things out just one more uh perspective I want to add to this especially in the the this Dark Age that we're living in and brother B says there's going to be a resurrection in the evening time a time when there's been Creeds and denominations that have so bound down the people that they're blind and miserable and naked and wretched and don't know it it's The Darkest Hour there's ever been but in that time of gloominess and despair and darkness it shall be light it is the rising of the sun and the blood of Jesus cries out and if you'll accept it there's forgiveness and if you don't it's judgment right and so Jeremiah CH 22:5 just taking this one statement he says but if you will not hear these words I swear by myself sayi the Lord that this house shall become a desolation so a great warning to Israel if you don't obey if you don't do what I say if you don't follow my voice then you'll become desolate you become judged you'll you'll suffer Vengeance and sure enough it happens in chapter 25 we know that they do not obey the voice of the Lord says moreover I will take from them the voice of Mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the sound of the millstones its work its business and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment now why does it come to this because they would not hear his voice and because they would not accept him because they would not hear his voice there was uh consequence there was judgment they became a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years so this is prophecy of Israel's 70 years of bondage their 70 years of bondage is a type of denominational bondage in the church ages we if we not even take a time to go through Babylonian Rule and the Dark Ages and the Conquering the tearing down of the church and the Conquering of the church by the Catholic Spirit and the Antichrist we know that when we arrive at the L DEC age Christ has been put out of the church can even look at the sense of the church is still sleeping in the parable for form but then we come to the age of full Redemption restoration a lot of themes that I'm just wanting to point back to it's not a Reformation under the spirit of man but it's full Redemption and you can see this parallel even in the book of Jeremiah you can see how that they were under a bondage they were in Babylon but God's going to call them out of Babylon bring them back to Jerusalem and restore the house of the Lord going to bring them back to the rightful place and so in Jeremiah 25 it's a prophecy of Jerusalem being desolate and broken it's not a Dwelling Place of God nor is it a Dwelling Place of his people this is where God was to dwell amongst his people they was going to build the house of the Lord and the temple and the walls were erected and God was going to be there behind the veil and upon the ark and this was where God would commune and this is where the people would come to and bring their sacrifices and this great holy city of Jerusalem but now it's desolate God doesn't dwell there nor does do the people of God dwell there what a dark time now think about this in parallel to the church age is where said Christ has been kicked out of the church the way brother brandham says it one place is Christ has been bound by Creeds and dogmas for 2,000 years the very Creeds of Babylon spiritual Babylon the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the Bride are no longer present the voice of gladness and the light of the candle are gone but in the in the sermon it is the rising of the Sun and he said the first time they'll come forth for the bride age another controversial phrase for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live ye live also remember how we read that a moment ago where brother BR says John 14:12 uh in the middle of that because I live ye live also and the works that I do you do also he says there will be a resurrection in the evening time it's going to be there he says because I live he live also speaking to his wife speaking to his wife brother Brandon when he's taking it uh Thessalonians he says and and these things shall be until she or the scripture says till he be taken out of the way and he says she there the bride when she's gone the Antichrist is able to take completely over H and greater work shall she do because I go to my father and he says because I live ye live also speaking to his wife yes right so it's speaking to this end time Union to the bride because I live ye live also now we could all you may not remember exactly what's next but once I start saying we could all just say it what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost now H how was it waved you can say the Holy Ghost poured out upon Peter and the the rest of the the the the Believers there in the upper room and Peter comes out preaching the word of God on the day of Pentecost he says the word made manifest now I say it's to be waved again in the last day so in this Resurrection out of dark denominationalism this light that comes it is a restoration just as Jerusalem was going to be built back up and just as Jerusalem is going to be restored and the temple is going to be restored and the presence of God is prophesied to come back into the house of the Lord the bride is going to be restored amen and as the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride were out no longer heard in Jerusalem the voice of the bridegroom in this La last hour brings the bride to be his body and his voice amen so in Jeremiah chter 33: 10 and 11 thus saith the Lord again there shall be heard in this place where you say shall be desolate without man and without Beast even in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without Beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good and this Resurrection out of dark denominationalism and the breaking of these Creeds and denominations that have bound you down to the place where you serve the the the the world there is a voice that calls you out of bondage calls you out of Babylon we've said it a lot lately Revelations 18:4 and now there is a voice of joy and a voice of gladness it's the voice of your beloved amen it's the voice of your bridegroom and it brings forth the voice of the Bride what is this voice in the end time it's the same voice on the day of Pentecost it's Christ brother bradam in the sermon the restoration of the Bride tree he says organizations died out now as he's looking at this restoration of the Bride Tree in April 62 he says Christ has again centered himself like the cap of a pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming of the cap now for those in the three Camp there's a four right so he forms himself outside of those stages the four life Messengers and again I'm not just using the math to all of a sudden make us lock up but he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself so there's this last step he said must come into Perfection so every age has been the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer there's been justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost but now in the end time for the entire thing they without us could not be made perfect Christ himself centers himself on the Capstone on coming of the Capstone Christ coming Grace Grace he reveals himself in this end time the seven seal brings them back back to Earth the book has been open there's a lot of things happening in this end time time he says what is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture where they're Justified Sanctified and the baptisms of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the house of God that's been our theme this whole year the house of God shall live again God has built you up to be his Tabernacle to be his Temple the house of God is living again in you you are his body therefore you must be his hands you must be his eyes and maybe even more critically you are his voice in this end time whose sins are going to be remitted it it has to be there has to be a crying out of the atonement there has to be a life that's being lived that expresses a hope to people who are in darkness this house of God will live again I believe it's the voice of Mercy it's the church that's taken the place of Christ it's the bride that's been dressed in the bleeding word amen yes sir this is the invisible Union and the sermon the Feast of the trumpets and I'm I'm almost done here just making tremendous time I feel listen to this statement in the Feast of the trumpets I I typed these up uh myself and I typed the feast if the trumpets so I'm so glad I didn't have a slide up there brother Michael one time saw a typo in one of them and he thought for sure he's like what is brother Aaron trying to do here you know CU got everybody looking for an Easter egg there got to be some point in it I kind love how I have that Mystique about me now I just make a horrible mistake I'm like did you catch that did you catch that man that was pretty big man but no the feast if the trumpets and brother B says he said in the evening time the clouds will move away Grant it Lord roll back the clouds Lord the denominations will fade and the same gospel the same word made flesh and he says as he promised in Luke 17:30 the same gospel with the same thing would take place in the evening time just when the Shadows are getting low the same gospel the same Christ that lived in flesh back Yonder at the beginning on the Eastern people you listening I'm almost done shall live again in the western people at the end time amen it shall be light in the evening time the same Christ to the Eastern people and the same way now let me let me say this this has just open up a whole area to really really uh think about God who had made himself known to the Old Testament Church the Jews and how that God gave them physical signs and gave them a physical land and he reveals himself to the Jews as Christ the fleshly physical Messiah that was their Messiah that was the Capstone to their their Church ages and so there's a transition that comes and going to enter a totally different dispensation and it's calling because they were called out of a natural land into the promised land and then Christ now this culmination this climax he's there in the flesh as their Messiah and he's telling them that I'm going to pour out power upon you and you're going to come out of your sins and from a a sinful condition a spiritual condition into a spiritual Promised Land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so what you modeled after the flesh I want you to do spiritually so when the promise comes to the Gentiles they have no physical Messiah but yet Christ is coming to the the Gentiles in the beginning of the church through the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now the Jews will see Christ again one day and he will reveal himself and how is he going to do it in flesh but in this end time when Christ is going to reveal himself to his bride for an invisible union he does not come in flesh of of as he was in in the Eastern people but in the Feast of the trumpets he says that we will know our mate the revealed word listen your bridegroom is here the promise that he would come is being fulfilled right now don't go look for him don't go wait for brother Brenham to come back you've got to find him here now revealing himself in [Music] Mercy same Christ he says it shall be light in the evening time because he reveals himself spiritually to the Gentiles oh we're going to see him we will see him we'll meet him in the air but he doesn't come back to earth in flesh doesn't reveal himself on Earth in that body until the Millennium and brother B said that's the coming everyone's looking for I believe it may even be in the church he says his second coming coming up he says in his second coming he's talking about when he reveals himself in flesh to the Jews because between the Son of God and the church ages and before he reveals himself as son of David in the Millennium when he comes back to Earth with his bride that third coming he reveals himself as the son of man to take his bride the same gospel the same word made flesh that lived in flesh back Yonder at the beginning on the Eastern people will live again in the western people at the end time so 2 Corinthians chap 5: 19 let's just read that verse to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world un himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed and I want to say it this way unto you the word of atonement amen he has you new creatures in Christ Jesus he has given you the ministry of atonement you new creatures in Christ Jesus he has committed to you the word of atonement now we might think okay all right I'm going to go to the malls during Christmas time and I'm going to Street preach oh it'll go viral I'm sure let it start at home let the ministry of atonement start at home let it start with those that you know it's it's not brother BR cautious don't be weird with it live the life live the life be sensitive find yourself uh uh being tuned up don't have to get a bullhorn and go on the corner street corner and just go let's just all go to kiern Commons uh the Friday last Friday before Christmas and let's just all get on our bullhorns pass out slot you know pamphlets and you know gays are going to hell and you know prolife this and screaming and ranting and yelling and foaming at the mouth and I guarantee you someone who's broken and hurting and wanting to find joy is going to look at you like that's what I've always wanted that he's given us the ministry and the word of at moment been focusing a lot of my studies on uh the Mighty God unveiled before us or the one that we've read the most to you lately is the unveiling of God and he says he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to to self to reveal him to others he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to himself him to others let us die to traditions and things to reveal him to other die to denominations to reveal him to others we are to do that die to self die to Traditions die to denominations so that we can be reveal him oh I can't give Revelation but I can be a LIF lived I can be a voice I can be salty there's things that can be expressed through through our own lives that gives an opportunity for sins to be remitted amen because it's the life it's the token it's the life being lived yes and in message token brother B says this he says let me be a brother let me live the example of what Christ said a man should be let me be a brother to a brother a brother to a sister can we just all take this very personal right now brother Bram said let this be personal he's talking about the Greater Works well I know we all want to go out and create squirrels and we want to do greater things but let's just be a brother let's be an example of what a man should be because where are those Greater Works going to come from it's not going around saying I forgive your sins and I forgive your sins but it's being it's the word being sufficiently expressed that would draw somebody that they would see Christ being unveiled that we would reveal him to others his nature and his character I believe this will just fit so well with what my burden is for the next subject I want to explore is how how can Christ be accurately reflected in our lives so that others can see him as they need him yes and if someone is if someone is has is physically in pain they they want something to minister to that physical pain and there's I guess uh I guess the joke is is well you know I sometimes when of my kids or something happens and they say well Dad my foot hurts or my my knee hurts or my head hurts I said give me your finger right I'll take your mind off your knee I'll just make your finger hurt I like well that's not what I'm looking for says man I'm I'm I I'm really broke and I'm going to lose my job it's like here's a pie it's like well that that'll take care of my Hunger but that's not going to take care of my problem so it's it's kind of it's we don't want to be the kind of like the distraction right like oh man that's horrible look right and just try to take their mind off and that's what we do when we when we're have a baby or something like that that we can't get to settle down right you you want to distract them somehow oh look look at this look at that they start acting really really weird it's not going to work when somebody really really needs Christ we need to be the Christ they need in the moment where they're at so they can see them and know him like this is exactly what I needed am so he says let me be a brother to a brother a sister to a s a brother to a sister I love this let me be a minister to the ministers let me be an example of examples let me show to the world that this word is Christ the only way I can do it is to come into him because I can't do it myself you can't do it but let the word and you become one then it lives itself out you are a walking Epistle of Jesus Christ when he's got complete total control of you to make every word doesn't that just kind of tie into the church is now taking the place of Christ carrying on his ministry it's to carry on his work that you take the place of God that's exactly what it is God manifested in flesh just as he promised this is going to be personal that we as the bride in the last days we as his as his voice in whom the Holy Spirit dwells there's a resurrection in the evening time where this token has now brought us into perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ and the voice of God is in the bride the spirit and the bride say come and the same gospel the same Christ is living again in people at the end time because the word and you become one it lives itself out so he says let me be a brother maybe you want to say Lord let me be a sister let me be an example of what a lady should be that's why the Bible I mean listen I know maybe uh haven't dwelt a lot on it and there's uh some scriptures I just want to use and some points I was want to bring out brother brandom even in the token says you're not a pushover you you have character you go God your character is God's character it's not a pushover Mercy is not saying oh well you know what it doesn't matter if you cut your hair it doesn't matter if you you know you you you paint your face it doesn't matter if you are in the world and you do this and it's kind of have this what is it it's the sissification of society taking place in the gospel where everyone gets a participation trophy everybody wins and nobody loses and we all want to be on the the couch of leod DEA getting our counseling I need to take a half day right you know I need a mental health break well what you need a break from I is is the world what you need a break from is this dumbing down of the word of God and recognize the word of God teaches something very very plain about how a man's to be a man and a lady's to be a lady and if you're if you're if you're Shing that and making excuses there's Hellfire waiting for that we got to wake ourselves up to recognize what the word should look like in a lady what the word should look like in a man CU it lives itself out brother brandom says I'm closing on this Brothers you could come to your instruments I just I just pray that we can all these last few weeks we have uh uh together for service in the I hope we could just all be together and have some wonderful Services together coming up brother B says God is moving in his church and showed all this is in token we've been keeping the lamb up now for quite a while watching seeing what he's doing watching his nature and everything but now the token has got to be applied it's got to be applied it's the only thing except a man be born of the spirit and of the water he will no wise enter in now again I think this I want to hearken back to say well what about in other Ages were they they not born again I think that we don't even need to entertain it I mean yeah I believe they were yes absolutely were every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer they're sealed in the body of Christ they receive the Holy Ghost well they believed in this there was an a to there was a voice there was an interceder father forgive them they don't know what they do one when there's an atonement when one is interceding when one is mediating they met the mark But The Mark of this age is perfection and you know what I might find myself finally one day saying is there time travel because I really want to go back to live in the day when God was met the mark and there was a lot of excuses for people who didn't meet the mark because we're living in an hour where it's like the full words being unveiled and I can say well I don't really think this matters and the word of God says it does well I really wish I didn't have to do this and the Bible says you better do it that's good and it starts pulling it down really really tight and I think what we have to recognize is Lord I can't do this without you live yourself out through me and accept it just believe it amen the token has got to be applied in this end time we must be born again and he says and we should love one another Believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you just a just listen a minute I don't think I have the statement here but we were reading it the other night as a family in our devotions brother says you got to separate yourself from the foolishness of this world in the token message he's talking about it he says if you've ever believed me you believe it now it's time to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the Bible believe Jesus Christ and love and honor and respect one another men respect your wives you respect your homes bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the home not just one for the whole home had to be brought and everything had to be brought in we should love each other believers should separate themselves from the world and as he continues he said they weren't come together to talk about the token they had to come together to apply it not just sympathize with it not just identify with it it had to be applied and to think that after the seals have been preached and Christ is the mystery of God preached and he says if you've ever listened to me if you ever believed me believe me now it's time to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the Bible believe Jesus Christ love honor and respect one another he says men to wives and respect your homes bring your family together it's applying the token to your home this is the voice of Mercy why because in that Exodus if the blood wasn't applied if the token wasn't applied it was [Music] death he says it's time to quit fussing with one another you know it strikes me I'm just thinking about it it seems like the world has come up with a million ways for us to be separated we're divided along lines of you know combustion engines and Electric engines and which Camp are you in and there's all sorts of ways for us to be separated whether it be political allegiances or allegiances to certain kind of food and you know there's people that can have really look down on you if you don't eat grass-fed beef you think I'm joking right they just think you're good to think that you you wait what you eat processed foods and it's almost as if you feel like you know you're you're you're condemning your family to hell because you buy Laz potato chips and and and people can be real judgmental and harsh and critical listen I I bring it up just to say this the world is finding a lot of ways to separate us put us in camps well they're this way and they're that way and then we fuss over it and people get bent out of shape and people uh do things that just divide and divide and becomes a tick in your crawl listen and it's time for us to lay aside all that foolishness all those things would divide us and come back to the thing that unites us you can remain faithful to your uh to the places you want to eat and the grass-fed beef and those who want to be vegan and those that want to do this one that's fine there's no law against those things but we better put we better come to that place of Fellowship where we all find ourselves under the protection of this blood under the token and that's what we focus on and for this this purpose so that we can be the voice of Mercy because the Greater Works the ministry of reconciliation it's all in there and it's a part of the responsibility that we have today if we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer invite you to stand together with me a gracious Heavenly Father Lord as we close this service we ask that you'd be gracious to us [Music] Lord maybe it's a little chilly outside but warm in here some of the people that are missing Lord it might feel a little spread out and I realize maybe a lot of things uh visually Lord or things as far as feeling can cause our minds to wonder a little bit and Lord as i' I've challenged the people to really think about these things or chew on it and consider it there might be a lot of paradoxes a lot of misle pieces but I believe that there is a dovetail in these things if it feels like I've put a lot of pieces together that near each other that don't Bel belong in the same place Lord you just take it rightly divided in the hearts of the people as I've put it out there trusting that I've rightly divided it in Ministry Lord and I'm putting the right things out there for them to consider May the Holy Spirit take it and bring the dovetail Lord the bride is not crucified on the cross the bride is not a bleeding lamb on a Mercy Seat but Jesus said that whatever sins we remit they will be remitted any sins we retain they will be retained brother Bram told us in the scripture that when Peter stood on the day of Pentecost and preached Jesus Christ it pricked men in their hearts and they said what must we do and Peter gave the prescription to repent that was God commanding men everywhere the very ones who had crucified them calling them to Mercy to The Mercy Seat and Lord may we be the very voice of the blood crying out in this hour as vessels of Mercy starting first with our spouses with our children not be condemning not be harsh not be judgmental Lord but just cry out father forgive them for they know not what they do that Lord when we have the right opportunity we could be able to accurately accurately reflect Mercy Lord the token the challenge of the hour to get in to receive Christ to no longer linger in foolishness to straighten up Lord and may it find a heart that's willing and receptive Lord Lord we love you we commit the people to you tonight I pray that you have a Grace Upon Us physically and emotionally spiritually go with us as we're dismissed protect us Lord as we have a couple weeks yet Before Christmas may you watch out over us our decisions our finances Lord the attitudes the pressures that can be put on us Lord at the end of the year there's bonuses handed out there's people looking forward to certain things Lord may we just trust you for whatever it might be Lord just trust you watch out over us Lord protect us keep us may we find our joy May there be a voice of gladness and a voice of Joy ringing out in the streets father bless us I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
