[0:00] my title this evening is perfect Liberty
[0:03] as you could see here and I'm taking it
[0:06] from this particular scripture in verse
[0:08] 25 where it says who so lookth into the
[0:11] perfect law of Liberty I had titled it
[0:14] the perfect law of Liberty but it just
[0:15] kind of very at the last minute I just
[0:18] felt perfect Liberty is how I really
[0:20] want to present this to you at the
[0:21] outset uh Lord willing Sunday morning
[0:24] we'll talk about perverted Liberty so
[0:25] you kind of get an idea of where we're
[0:27] going and then maybe practiced Liberty
[0:30] and uh I want to begin to explore the
[0:34] scriptural concepts of Liberty and
[0:37] freedom and I would say that freedom in
[0:40] Christ Liberty in Christ these things of
[0:43] of uh that relate to those very terms as
[0:45] far as the Liberty that we have in
[0:47] Christ I think that sometimes they're
[0:49] very difficult to understand I know that
[0:52] um for years I've sought fellowship and
[0:54] asked questions and tried to just
[0:57] understand better how my free moral
[1:00] agency works with God's election and and
[1:03] just you know how much free moral agency
[1:05] do I have how much Liberty and freedom
[1:07] do I have to choose in light of the fact
[1:09] that God chose me and that God made that
[1:11] making that decision has elected me and
[1:13] then predestinated me and so it it is
[1:16] difficult and then I think sometimes
[1:17] it's not only difficult to understand
[1:19] but then it's easily misunderstood
[1:21] because Liberty's presented in a way
[1:24] that it actually isn't Liberty or we
[1:26] conflate certain meanings or certain
[1:28] conditions in life and we say this is
[1:30] what it means to be free and this is
[1:31] what Freedom means and so it's very easy
[1:34] to to mix those things up and I found
[1:38] when I was coming to this place in the
[1:40] series I was like Wow imagine that
[1:43] tomorrow is Independence Day I didn't
[1:44] even plan this and so I just I just say
[1:47] if it's anything it's Vindication it's
[1:50] Vindication or probably more like
[1:53] coincidence but we're just searching for
[1:54] a word to describe it but I hadn't
[1:56] premeditated this it's just worked out
[1:58] this way and so I have intention
[2:00] uh um decided to explore some things
[2:03] related to tomorrow so this way you get
[2:04] homeschool credit for this and and you
[2:08] can put this on your transcript but this
[2:10] the series on the house of the Lord from
[2:11] the very beginning this Series has been
[2:14] about the process of determining value
[2:17] things that really matter and if doing
[2:19] so if we could find True Value then it
[2:21] can lead to simplicity so what I've been
[2:24] studying personally is on the Simplicity
[2:26] that is in Christ and everything that
[2:28] that means and how that this comes back
[2:30] to that one thing needful or the one
[2:32] thing have I desired that will I seek
[2:34] after his presence that I would dwell in
[2:37] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[2:38] life to inquire in his Temple that I I
[2:41] want to behold his face and that life
[2:44] being reduced desires being reduced to
[2:46] one that would be the greatest
[2:48] Simplicity wouldn't that be amazing if
[2:50] when you woke up you just had one desire
[2:52] all my desires have been reduced to one
[2:54] and it had nothing to do with the cup of
[2:56] coffee had nothing to do with the
[2:57] fivemile run it had nothing to do with
[2:59] any kind of bucket list your desire was
[3:01] to please him your desire was his
[3:03] presence your desire was
[3:05] Christ and so I feel the need to do this
[3:09] and it may be just for me but I want to
[3:10] kind of give you the breadcrumbs on how
[3:12] the Lord has led me to this particular
[3:15] part on the subject of Liberty and I
[3:18] have kind of seeded a few things in
[3:19] there maybe over the last year or so on
[3:22] the subject of Liberty and how it can be
[3:24] misused and how there's this uh maybe
[3:27] the LIE of Liberty but I want to start
[3:29] with 1 Corinthians
[3:31] 3:16 and this will this is the
[3:34] breadcrumbs portion where I'm kind of
[3:35] backing up just showing you how I
[3:37] arrived at this particular place he says
[3:40] know ye not that ye are the temple of
[3:43] God and that the spirit of God dwelleth
[3:45] in you so we realize that in a type in
[3:48] in image of scripture we are the temple
[3:51] of God or we could say the his building
[3:53] or the house of the Lord if his Spirit
[3:56] dwells in us so the spirit of God
[3:59] dwelling in US we are his habitation we
[4:01] are his building we could say then in
[4:03] some ways that we are the house of the
[4:06] Lord and then he comes back to the same
[4:08] thing in chapter 6 verse 19 he says what
[4:11] know you not that your body is the
[4:13] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[4:16] which you have of God and ye are not
[4:18] your own so again in this idea that your
[4:21] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost the
[4:23] spirit of God dwells in you do you not
[4:25] know that that if the spirit of God
[4:27] dwells in you you are the temple of the
[4:30] Lord and then he says and ye are not
[4:31] your own so there is based upon the way
[4:35] that Paul is saying this and the way
[4:36] that he's dealing with this in the
[4:38] Corinthian Church especially this first
[4:40] Corinthians letter there is this sense
[4:42] of Duty there is this sense of
[4:44] responsibility that we have as been the
[4:46] dwelling place of God that it's to and
[4:50] brother bam often visits it this way you
[4:52] say well you say you have the Holy Ghost
[4:53] and do this and do that and is your life
[4:56] worthy of the gospel maybe a way that we
[4:58] could position the question and it's
[5:00] merely it's basically saying this that
[5:02] if you are the habitation of God there's
[5:04] a duty and responsibility uh in a manner
[5:06] of life and living and uh maybe
[5:09] trajectory in your testimony to to where
[5:12] it's evidence that God is in you and so
[5:15] there is a duty and responsibility if
[5:18] his Spirit dwells in us I am a a
[5:21] Dwelling Place of God and therefore let
[5:24] there be a manifestation of God's
[5:26] presence in my life let there be a
[5:28] continual yielding so that the presence
[5:30] can have
[5:31] preeminence now fast forward into second
[5:34] chapter 2 Corinthians chapter 3 now he's
[5:37] writing to the same group he's
[5:39] commending them for their dealing with
[5:41] sin maybe taking serious the fact that
[5:44] they are their body is the Temple of the
[5:45] Holy Ghost and and a temple of God if
[5:48] the spirit of God dwells in you and he
[5:50] makes this statement very familiar with
[5:52] all of us and he says now the Lord is
[5:53] that Spirit talk about when it shall
[5:55] turn to the Lord the veil is going to be
[5:57] taken away he says now the Lord is that
[5:59] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[6:01] is there is
[6:04] Liberty this word uh Liberty it speaks
[6:07] of Freedom even in the I would say in
[6:10] the Greek and the the word that this is
[6:11] derived from it's the absence of
[6:14] restraint or not being bound by some
[6:16] sort of obligation and we're thinking
[6:18] yeah that's kind of kind of what I want
[6:20] I want that kind of Liberty and he say
[6:23] where the spirit of the Lord there is
[6:24] Liberty there's a freedom and we would
[6:27] maybe begin to build that even around
[6:29] own concepts of Freedom that we have the
[6:31] power of
[6:32] self-determination that we have we are
[6:34] in the state of free will uh that this
[6:37] Freedom as it would speak of even
[6:39] scripturally this Deliverance of bondage
[6:41] that I was bound and I couldn't make
[6:42] decisions and I couldn't do things but
[6:44] now being made free I have the power of
[6:47] self-determination I I am this in the
[6:49] state of uh Free Will so I have free
[6:52] choice today if we speak of Freedom or
[6:54] even Liberty it's freedom to do as one
[6:57] chooses to have again free will
[7:01] now I believe the scripture says where
[7:03] the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty
[7:05] that even in the use of that word in the
[7:07] meaning we could use it in the same
[7:08] sense that of Freedom or the absence of
[7:11] restraint and this free
[7:14] choice but to maybe use a little bit of
[7:17] a play on words how do we exercise this
[7:20] Liberty without Taking
[7:22] Liberties in other words how do we
[7:25] exercise what does this Liberty look
[7:27] like without going beyond the the proper
[7:30] bounds you know when someone you say
[7:32] make yourself at home and you're
[7:34] like
[7:35] thanks I'd like to go to the master
[7:38] suite and take a bath uh since we don't
[7:40] have a bathtub in our house you tell me
[7:42] to make myself at home I was like what
[7:43] kind of soaking tub do you have where is
[7:45] it and so we might say oh my house your
[7:48] house well then if you're at home you're
[7:49] free you you can do things in your home
[7:51] with the blinds closed and you could be
[7:53] a family and you could be yourself in
[7:54] ways that maybe you can't out in public
[7:56] so someone says you know you make
[7:58] yourself at home and we would could say
[8:01] well I'm going to take my Liberty and
[8:03] then as soon as you step across the
[8:05] proper bounds You Are Taking Liberties
[8:08] in other words you are exercising your
[8:10] Liberty so much to where you're taking
[8:11] away somebody else's that you you are so
[8:15] free that you're putting me in
[8:17] bondage a and and so there is there's
[8:21] something to think about in terms of
[8:22] well if I'm free completely free and
[8:25] again I've been digesting a lot of these
[8:27] scriptures and where that the son of man
[8:29] whom he hath set free is free indeed
[8:33] that there's this concept of Liberty and
[8:35] freedom and being set free that we want
[8:36] to uh enjoy and we say where the spirit
[8:39] of the Lord is there is liberty so we
[8:41] have this sense of where God's spirit is
[8:44] there is Liberty God's spirit dwells in
[8:47] me then therefore I'm free I have been
[8:49] liberated and I want to experience and
[8:51] enjoy my
[8:53] freedom so I want to I want to look at
[8:56] that how can we exercise this Liberty
[8:58] what does this liberty mean without uh
[9:01] Taking
[9:02] Liberties and let's start by wrestling
[9:05] with the concept of Liberty even in
[9:07] society and with the Declaration of
[9:11] Independence which was adopted on July
[9:13] 4th 1776 by the Continental Congress and
[9:17] this is The Faded copy I think that is
[9:19] uh um even in Washington DC and I'm
[9:22] going to read to you this declaration of
[9:25] independence now what I'm doing with
[9:28] this is I'm giving getting you your
[9:29] homeschool credits and exploring this
[9:32] idea and concept of freedom in light of
[9:34] the fact that this is Independence
[9:36] Eve this is how it begins the unanimous
[9:39] Declaration of the 13 United States of
[9:41] America in my original slide I had the
[9:43] direct Declaration of Independence on
[9:45] this slide and I realized I spelled
[9:47] Independence wrong and I said fool me
[9:50] once like I know nobody's going to say
[9:54] anything they're like but what is inter
[9:56] pretend
[10:00] we hold these truths to be self-evident
[10:02] that all men are created equal that they
[10:05] are endowed by their creator with
[10:07] certain unalienable rights that among
[10:10] these are life liberty and the pursuit
[10:13] of happiness these are uh weighty words
[10:16] I believe that men of those days and the
[10:18] writers in those times their word was
[10:20] their currency and they spent them
[10:22] Thrifty they were very Thrifty very
[10:24] careful with their words and so these
[10:26] are uh weighty words and they they're
[10:28] very well crafted all men are created
[10:30] equal and
[10:32] endowed by God we could say with certain
[10:35] unalienable rights like these are
[10:37] guarantees they these are these ought to
[10:39] be expected and the among these these
[10:42] are not just the only ones but he says
[10:44] among these are life liberty and the
[10:46] pursuit of happiness now I believe that
[10:49] it speaks to these unalienable rights
[10:52] that to secure these rights they say
[10:54] continuing governments are instituted
[10:57] among men deriving their just powers
[11:00] from the consent of the governed so if
[11:02] we as human beings have a right to life
[11:05] liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[11:07] that in order that every man would be
[11:09] able to exercise these rights that
[11:11] governments are then formed and
[11:14] instituted and the governed give consent
[11:17] to that that power to say look out after
[11:19] so that we can pursue life liberty and
[11:21] happiness and then it says that whenever
[11:24] any form of government becomes
[11:26] destructive of these ends now they give
[11:29] the context for some of us who aren't
[11:31] maybe thinking more deeply about this
[11:32] our Declaration of Independence was
[11:34] basically tell it was telling Great
[11:36] Britain we are no longer subject to you
[11:38] to your rule of law to your government
[11:41] and they're giving the cause and the
[11:42] reason for them saying that we will no
[11:44] longer uh you are not sovereign over us
[11:47] you're no longer governing us but we're
[11:48] declaring our independence from British
[11:51] rule so it says whenever a form of
[11:53] government government becomes
[11:55] destructive of these ends and whenever
[11:58] government and power begins to deprive
[12:00] us of life liberty and the pursuit of
[12:02] happiness he said it is the right of the
[12:04] people to alter or to abolish it and to
[12:07] Institute new government laying its
[12:09] foundations on such principles and
[12:11] organizing its power in such form as to
[12:14] them shall seem most likely to affect
[12:17] their safety and happiness these are big
[12:20] words but I think we all get what
[12:21] they're trying to
[12:22] say that whenever these a unalienable
[12:27] rights begin to erode and we no longer
[12:30] have these
[12:31] Liberties then the people can abolish
[12:34] the government that's taking away these
[12:36] rights or that is not promoting them and
[12:39] that the people have a right to choose a
[12:40] government that will affect their safety
[12:42] and happiness and then it list uh this
[12:45] is this is the statement it makes before
[12:47] it list all their complaints against the
[12:48] king the history of the present King of
[12:50] Great Britain is a history of repeated
[12:52] injuries and usurpations all having in
[12:55] direct object the establishment of an
[12:58] absolute tyranny over the states to
[13:01] prove this let's fact let facts be
[13:03] submitted to a candid world and then
[13:05] boom they list them all and then one of
[13:08] them towards the very end a prince whose
[13:10] character is thus marked by Every Act
[13:14] which may Define a tyrant is unfit to be
[13:17] the ruler of a free
[13:19] people so in the Declaration of
[13:22] Independence it sets forth the idea of
[13:26] Liberty that man has this right to life
[13:29] liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[13:32] that if he's deprived of his right to
[13:35] pursue happiness his right of Liberty
[13:37] then that he has somehow been enslaved
[13:40] or been subjugated to something that is
[13:43] not his right or that is contrary to his
[13:45] rights as a person and this King has
[13:48] become a
[13:49] tyrant because he is governing in a way
[13:52] that infringes upon their Liberty and
[13:54] this Prince whose character is marked by
[13:56] Every Act that defines a tyrant he is
[13:58] not fit to rule over free people so it
[14:01] does suggest in in the outset that
[14:04] having these rights it's necessary to
[14:06] have government that would secure those
[14:08] rights that in the absence of order and
[14:10] structure and government that it's
[14:13] that's when people with their Liberty
[14:15] take Liberty and that if there's not the
[14:17] proper government over people then uh we
[14:21] really don't have Liberty it's chaos and
[14:24] so those that are in charge of
[14:25] government should be chosen by the
[14:27] people with the consent of the people
[14:29] looking out after their needs and their
[14:31] their rights and securing them but
[14:34] whenever one governs in a way that takes
[14:37] away these rights or becomes destructive
[14:39] of these rights then they're saying we
[14:41] ought to abolish this government and
[14:42] start a new one because that's not a fit
[14:46] government over free people right so in
[14:50] the preamble to the US
[14:53] Constitution which was drafted in 1787
[14:56] it kind of it in the Preamble it
[14:58] hearkens back back to these things of
[15:00] the prior decade we the people of the
[15:01] United States in order to form a more
[15:04] perfect union establish
[15:07] justice ensure domestic
[15:09] tranquility provide for the common
[15:12] defense promote the general welfare and
[15:15] secure the blessings of liberty to
[15:17] ourselves and our posterity do ordain
[15:20] and establish this constitution for the
[15:22] United States of America we're going to
[15:24] set forth and writing a constitution a
[15:27] governing document that will secure the
[15:29] rights of the people that will be set up
[15:32] in such a way to where the unalienable
[15:34] rights of the individual of life liberty
[15:36] and the pursuit of happiness are not
[15:38] destroyed by government
[15:40] itself that we will uh affect our safety
[15:45] and
[15:46] happiness that we will establish a more
[15:49] perfect union which is righteous ensures
[15:52] domestic
[15:53] tranquility provides for defense and
[15:55] promotes general welfare and secures
[15:57] blessings of liberty it really is is
[15:59] describing that place where you don't
[16:01] you're not fearful you're at liberty and
[16:04] so the Constitution was established to
[16:07] promote Liberty this constitution
[16:10] piggybacks with this declaration of
[16:12] independence this is what we're trying
[16:13] to achieve we've seen tyrrany in the
[16:16] King of Great Britain we've seen how it
[16:17] takes away the rights of the people so
[16:20] now we want to establish he says a more
[16:22] perfect union that'll govern the United
[16:24] States of America and its people and
[16:27] avoid tyrannical rule
[16:29] yes as soon as this at the very time
[16:32] that it's being adopted Benjamin
[16:34] Franklin warns that the constitution can
[16:37] only end in despotism as other forms
[16:41] have at a time when he says that the
[16:43] people shall become so corrupted as to
[16:45] need despotic
[16:49] government now this is at the very time
[16:51] that it's being signed he's saying this
[16:55] government this this constitution is
[16:57] about as good as we can get
[16:59] but he says it's ultimately going to
[17:01] lead to tyranny itself despotism is
[17:03] going to happen it's that tyrannical
[17:05] rule of one with absolute power that
[17:08] though we have done our best to uh come
[17:11] up with what we think can be these Bill
[17:13] of Rights and things that we can have as
[17:15] as a society that'll look after life
[17:18] liberty in the pursuit of happiness he
[17:19] says it really can only end in tyranny
[17:23] when the people shall have become so
[17:25] corrupted as to need a desperate as a
[17:28] governor
[17:33] I'll give more context for this in a
[17:34] moment but Thomas
[17:36] mcau in 1857 he wrote a letter to Henry
[17:41] Randall and these being preserved and
[17:44] and I think it came up in the the
[17:45] writings of Jefferson when he were
[17:47] writing a book on the history of
[17:48] Jefferson he wrote this he was a
[17:50] historian a a and um a well-known figure
[17:53] in Great Britain so he's now writing
[17:55] this many years after the institution of
[17:57] the Constitution the the Declaration of
[17:59] Independence and this is his opinion of
[18:01] American democracy as a Brit I have long
[18:05] been convinced that institutions purely
[18:07] Democratic must sooner or later destroy
[18:10] Liberty or civilization or
[18:13] both okay you listen or you're not going
[18:15] to get your homeschool
[18:16] credit but this is the attitude now
[18:19] we're we're wan to understand Liberty
[18:20] what does it mean how far does it go how
[18:22] can I exercise it he's saying he's
[18:24] convinced that an institution that is
[18:26] purely Democratic and I believe this is
[18:28] why
[18:30] uh Benjamin Franklin answered you what
[18:32] kind of government do you have a
[18:34] monarchy or a republic he says a
[18:36] republic as long as we can keep it but
[18:38] yet a Democratic Society being different
[18:40] he says an institution is purely
[18:43] Democratic sooner or later either
[18:44] destroys Liberty destroys civilization
[18:47] or destroys
[18:49] both says either the poor would plunder
[18:52] the rich and civilization would perish
[18:56] now upon what basis would the poor
[18:58] plunder the rich
[18:59] Liberty life liberty and the pursuit of
[19:02] happiness the pursuit of possessions as
[19:04] Lo wrote it that there was a certain
[19:06] sense of entitlement that well my rights
[19:09] and Liberty and being free they the poor
[19:13] would plunder the rich and in plundering
[19:15] the rich civilization erodes and is
[19:17] destroyed or order in property would be
[19:19] saved by a strong military government
[19:22] and Liberty would perish kind of
[19:24] recognize these competing interest that
[19:27] if you're going to have Liberty that and
[19:30] this balancing of interest that the poor
[19:33] then take their Liberties and Destroy
[19:36] and take away from the rich and that
[19:39] destroys civilization well in order to
[19:40] preserve civilization you need a strong
[19:42] government and to keep the poor in their
[19:44] place and therefore it leads to a strong
[19:47] military government and Liberty would
[19:49] perish and mcau says to Randall there is
[19:52] nothing to stop you your Constitution is
[19:56] all sale and no anchor
[19:59] in establishing rights and the rights of
[20:01] the people and making Liberty uh
[20:03] preeminent and even uh kind of the the
[20:07] rally and cry and the appeal to emotions
[20:09] that some of the founding fathers
[20:11] appealed to that it is it is it is
[20:13] Liberty it is obedience to God to Rebel
[20:16] to tyranny a and the Give me liberty or
[20:20] give me death and and those those
[20:23] Concepts that we would say that Liberty
[20:25] became everything and that even one who
[20:27] would give up his liberties for the sake
[20:29] of Peace deserves neither Liberty or
[20:32] Peace So it places Liberty and freedom
[20:34] and these rights to choose and these
[20:36] inable right says this is the most
[20:38] important thing and we must preserve
[20:40] them and he says this is in his mind
[20:42] saying your Constitution is all sale and
[20:44] no
[20:46] anchor Alexis
[20:48] dville a French
[20:51] politician he wrote he said I would give
[20:53] and this is in his uh scathing writing
[20:57] on Democracy in America America and I
[20:59] realized maybe to these guys across the
[21:01] pond you know they didn't really want to
[21:02] think this is going to succeed so they
[21:04] had their hot political opinions about
[21:06] America and democracy so maybe we could
[21:09] take it with a grain of salt but mcau is
[21:11] saying that your democratic government
[21:14] your form of government will destroy
[21:16] Liberty or destroy civilization maybe
[21:19] both and now the French de teville says
[21:22] I would give the people under this
[21:23] instrument under this constitution 200
[21:26] years from the date of its ratification
[21:28] until they sinned under a complete
[21:30] despotism complete tin tyrannical Reign
[21:35] tyranny I give you 200 years before you
[21:38] do the people are so corrupted as
[21:39] Benjamin Franklin said that they need a
[21:42] tyrannical government a government that
[21:43] can bind the People by taking away
[21:45] Liberties in order to keep them from
[21:47] taking other people's Liberties or going
[21:49] too far as to destroy
[21:51] civilization and this is just the the
[21:56] the political science view this is the
[21:57] historical View these are the uh the
[22:00] debates and certainly from an academic
[22:02] standpoint and scholarship uh these
[22:04] weren't necessarily the prevailing
[22:06] opinions of the time that everyone
[22:07] agreed with even now today we could
[22:09] debate on it but mcau said there is
[22:12] nothing to stop you your Constitution is
[22:14] all sell and no anchor brother brandham
[22:16] referred specifically to him though not
[22:18] naming him and he said and the man was
[22:20] right that's exactly what's going
[22:23] on brother B refers to a British
[22:25] politician and refers to it several
[22:27] times this idea of no uh no anchor all
[22:31] sails and no anchor he said that man was
[22:34] right that's exactly what's going on
[22:37] when I was studying in Daniel 12:4 about
[22:39] how uh people shall run to and fro and
[22:42] knowledge shall increase and I was
[22:44] Finding where brother brandom is
[22:45] identifying that with respect to um the
[22:50] end times and what was taking place
[22:51] within society that knowledge is
[22:54] increasing and it's a negative thing it
[22:56] wasn't knowledge of the the of right or
[22:58] the knowledge of good and he makes this
[23:00] statement in the sermon this day this
[23:02] scripture is fulfilled and and it was in
[23:04] this hymn referring to Daniel 124 this
[23:07] is very near that he says in the world
[23:09] politics our world system is just as
[23:10] rotten as it can be he says I'm not a
[23:13] politician I'm a Christian I ain't got
[23:15] no business talking about politics but I
[23:18] just want to say they're rotten on both
[23:20] sides I voted once that was for Christ I
[23:22] got to win the devil voted against me
[23:25] and Christ voted for me depends on which
[23:27] way I cast my vote
[23:29] I'm glad I cast it on him that the world
[23:31] say what they want to I still believe
[23:32] that he's the same yesterday today and
[23:34] forever he will prove it he certainly
[23:36] will
[23:38] certainly and he says the increase in
[23:41] crime juvenile
[23:44] delinquency and as we were're speaking
[23:47] about the Labyrinth and how
[23:49] the Christianity becom a labyrinth was
[23:51] the erosion of society in the
[23:54] delinquencies of the church the
[23:55] delinquencies of the family therefore
[23:57] the delinquencies of the ch children
[23:59] says look at our nation once the flower
[24:01] of the earth our great democracy was
[24:03] born back there in the Declaration of
[24:05] Independence and the Declaration of
[24:07] Independence was signed and we had a
[24:09] democracy and our great forefathers and
[24:11] the things that they' done and we had a
[24:13] great nation but she's now rottening and
[24:16] crumbling and shaking and giving away
[24:19] this is where we are now amen this is
[24:21] where he's saying this in 1965 and man
[24:23] would be these uh these many years later
[24:26] 60 years later this is it's even
[24:29] worse it it's the it's the same seeds
[24:32] and Spirits manifesting more and more
[24:33] and more he says trying to tax people to
[24:36] get money to send Over Yonder to buy
[24:38] friendship with our enemies they're
[24:40] throwing it back in our face One World
[24:42] War Two world wars and still moving on
[24:44] to a third one we have this history of I
[24:48] in America to where where we have for a
[24:51] I mean before I get into maybe the pure
[24:54] politics of things but we say well
[24:56] America the Great America the Beautiful
[24:58] America America is interested in
[24:59] democracy and I believe that there is
[25:02] there's the good side to that but then
[25:03] there's the UND side where there's
[25:05] always something in it for
[25:06] America she's not purely altruistic says
[25:10] oh we just want to get rid of Saddam
[25:11] Hussein we want we don't want there to
[25:13] be weapons of mass destruction we care
[25:15] for these people and and there's just
[25:17] some kind of black substance over there
[25:21] that you know is worth a lot of stuff
[25:22] and you realize well what side are you
[25:24] taking in this well I'm just making
[25:27] observations you you know if there was a
[25:29] dictator there and there was no oil in
[25:31] the ground you know how long do you
[25:33] think a Cuba would last until you find
[25:36] that there's really good resources in
[25:38] there and it would maybe be worth
[25:40] getting in there and mixing things up
[25:42] and so I'm just saying
[25:45] that not all things are as they appear
[25:48] he said our nation's rotting and we're
[25:50] giv money away to buy friendships with
[25:52] our enemies and then it blows back in
[25:54] our face and America's watched this
[25:56] happen time and time again where they
[25:57] support something for certain reasons
[25:59] and they give power and weapons and
[26:01] money and then right around it's turn
[26:03] around and used against
[26:04] us he says politics is rotten corrupted
[26:08] rotten to the
[26:09] bottom in other words exactly what
[26:12] Franklin worried about what the British
[26:15] identified and even the French that
[26:17] eventually with our Constitution and our
[26:20] attempt to be a pure democracy perhaps
[26:23] not yielding completely to that of a
[26:25] republic I don't know but all I know is
[26:27] in the end this document has led us to a
[26:30] place to where civilization and Liberty
[26:33] are both being
[26:42] destroyed
[26:44] democracy which is could be a good way
[26:46] of describing our political system says
[26:49] our
[26:49] democracy formed of the Declaration of
[26:52] Independence formed by that Constitution
[26:53] is ruining both civilization and
[26:56] Liberty why because of the concept of
[26:59] Liberty it is freedoms it is Liberties
[27:02] to where with the whole idea of it's and
[27:05] brother brandham even says this about
[27:07] he's kind of speaking about the
[27:08] differences of one says well shout dance
[27:11] and speak in tongues and the other one
[27:12] said well I just want to stay real
[27:13] starchy and the other one says I would
[27:14] just want to shout he goes all sell no
[27:16] anchor and so the argument in the
[27:19] political debate and maybe brother
[27:20] Andrew Coffey will set me straight with
[27:23] with as long as I'm not an earshot about
[27:25] who said what and who does what but
[27:26] there's some argument as to the Republic
[27:28] an want to be the anchor and the de
[27:29] Democrats want to be the sell and that
[27:32] there's a push and pull and there's give
[27:33] and take and if you have all sell and no
[27:36] anchor you just you're going to go with
[27:38] the
[27:39] whims you go wherever Liberty and
[27:41] freedom takes you the will of the people
[27:43] the wants of the people the desires of
[27:44] the age people's rights and then how far
[27:47] does it
[27:49] go so there is just I I'd like to say
[27:54] just creating the stur these thought
[27:56] process in your mind that what is
[27:58] Liberty then the concept of Democratic
[28:01] Society and the founding of our nation
[28:03] and those doing it in terms of the
[28:04] creator has endowed us with rights that
[28:06] we have of life liberty and the pursuit
[28:08] of happiness that in fully exercising
[28:10] our Liberty and our sovereignty as a
[28:12] nation and necessarily then as
[28:14] individuals it's led to the destruction
[28:16] of civilization and it's eroding Liberty
[28:19] or it's destroying civilization and
[28:20] Liberty then what what is liberty and
[28:24] what is it good
[28:25] for do we necessarily have to and resp
[28:28] response elect a desperate a
[28:33] dictator do we need a
[28:36] king who rules with absolute
[28:42] tyranny now in second Corinthians
[28:44] chapter
[28:45] 3 we read verse 17 I'm going to read
[28:49] Verse 18 as well because now I want to
[28:51] look at in from a scriptural standpoint
[28:53] if we could call this our founding
[28:55] document our Declaration of Independence
[28:57] our constitution
[28:58] brother Bram does say in one place that
[29:00] if you had Christians running everything
[29:02] it'd be a different
[29:03] story and perhaps it could be said had
[29:06] you had Christians always running things
[29:08] it would have been a different story and
[29:09] then he says if you could put a George
[29:10] Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every
[29:12] office and it won't change now she's too
[29:14] far gone uh all sell and no anchor she's
[29:17] gone too far she can't get back that's
[29:21] why he said she's lost so now the Lord
[29:24] is that Spirit where the spirit of the
[29:26] Lord is there is liberty and everybody
[29:30] said sh right we like that where the
[29:33] spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[29:35] he says
[29:36] but we all with open face beholding as
[29:40] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[29:42] changed into the same image from glory
[29:45] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[29:48] Lord I believe that Paul is identifying
[29:51] the true nature and meaning of this
[29:53] Liberty that where the spirit of the
[29:54] Lord there is Liberty now the sense of
[29:57] Liber might conjure up ideas of being
[30:00] free and being set loose and I'm free to
[30:02] do what I
[30:04] want and he defines this Liberty or he
[30:07] defines what is meant by where the
[30:09] spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
[30:11] and he says that with an unveiled face
[30:13] by looking into the mirror of the word
[30:15] we
[30:16] change so where the spirit of the Lord
[30:18] is that Spirit of the Lord is in me
[30:20] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[30:22] liberty and therefore with the spirit of
[30:25] the Lord and an unveiled face I can look
[30:27] into the mirror the Lord the the word
[30:29] and I change and in changing I'm formed
[30:32] into Christ's image by that Spirit of
[30:35] the Lord so the Lord is that spirit and
[30:38] where the spirit is there's liberty and
[30:40] now he's saying that Spirit having
[30:43] brought Liberty by the spirit of Liberty
[30:47] or by Liberty I am changed into the
[30:50] image of
[30:54] Christ in other words now that we can
[30:56] behold the word
[30:59] now that you can process it now that you
[31:00] can see it we're free to be
[31:02] changed we've been set at Liberty to be
[31:05] formed into the image and to be Bears of
[31:08] partakers of the divine nature and
[31:09] therefore manifest and bear the image of
[31:12] Christ where the spirit of Lord is there
[31:14] is Liberty in other words Liberty to
[31:17] become it is freedom then from the worst
[31:20] of our
[31:21] humanities the worst of our thought
[31:23] processes the worst of our instincts the
[31:25] worst of our misunderstandings and these
[31:28] the Labyrinth of our mind and the the
[31:31] sins as we were looking at those the the
[31:33] failure in thought and action the
[31:34] frustration of thought in action and the
[31:37] frustration of Desire that we can find
[31:40] Liberty from the Labyrinth we can find
[31:42] Freedom from this Maze and this
[31:44] confusion in
[31:47] Christ so Paul says where the spirit of
[31:49] the Lord there is liberty and if I could
[31:51] put it this way and let me Define what I
[31:54] mean by where the spirit of the Lord is
[31:55] in the house of the Lord there is Liv
[31:57] Liberty in the house Lord and what I
[31:59] mean by that is that we all should be
[32:01] beholding the revealed word of God which
[32:04] is the glory of the Lord Christ the
[32:05] revealed word and by revealing the re
[32:08] looking into the revealed word that
[32:10] revelation of the word will change us
[32:13] into the same glorious image it'll bring
[32:15] us by eating the same thing Paul says
[32:17] eating the same bread we coales into the
[32:19] same image of
[32:22] Christ by that
[32:26] Liberty now James references the perfect
[32:29] law of Liberty with a similar
[32:31] emphasis I am going to spend the
[32:34] remainder of this service hopefully
[32:37] giving you you all enough time to start
[32:38] your freedom celebration
[32:40] early I was going to call Brother Reggie
[32:42] and ask him to bring fireworks tonight I
[32:45] just didn't get around to it that was
[32:47] how he earned one of his many nicknames
[32:49] pyop
[32:51] plet now so James is going to reference
[32:54] the perfect law of Liberty with a very
[32:57] similar
[32:59] emphasis as Paul Paul says where the
[33:00] spirit of Lord there's liberty and we
[33:02] all with open face beholding as the
[33:04] glass the glory of the Lord a mirror the
[33:05] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[33:07] glory of the
[33:08] Lord and now James in James chapter 1 I
[33:11] want to read this large portion verse s
[33:13] 19 to verse 27 now I just want you to
[33:17] kind of pick up on this I won't give a
[33:19] lot of uh U extra details to this he
[33:22] says wherefore my beloved Brethren let
[33:24] every man be swift to hear slow to speak
[33:27] slow to Wrath
[33:28] am this is our
[33:31] constitution this this is this is the
[33:34] word of God has given to us this is
[33:36] righteousness this is these are things
[33:38] that we take into
[33:39] consideration this is telling us what it
[33:42] means to be Christlike to be swift to
[33:44] hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the
[33:47] wrath of man worketh not the
[33:49] righteousness of God makes a lot of
[33:51] sense wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[33:54] and superfluity of naughtiness these are
[33:56] things that we ought to be doing
[33:58] and receive with meekness the engrafted
[34:00] word which is able to save your souls
[34:03] these are marching orders for the
[34:05] Christian those of us who are the house
[34:06] of the Lord and in whom the spirit
[34:08] dwells you are the dwelling place of God
[34:11] and you now having the spirit of God in
[34:14] you there's this Duty and responsibility
[34:16] is being a bearer of his presence to be
[34:18] swift to hear slow to speak slow to
[34:20] wrath to lay apart filthiness and
[34:23] naughtiness receive with meekness the
[34:25] engrafted word what a statement which is
[34:28] able to save your
[34:29] souls verse 22 in amplifying this be but
[34:32] be ye doers of the word and not hearers
[34:35] only deceiving your own selves that
[34:39] there is some self-deception when we are
[34:42] satisfied with saying we have heard we
[34:44] are satisfied with saying I know what it
[34:46] says and I understand and and this is
[34:49] what he said and God thought it brother
[34:51] man and spoke it I believe it that
[34:52] settles it there is a sense of being
[34:56] hearers but not doers
[34:58] that that s that uh that very concept of
[35:03] hearing and not
[35:05] manifesting involves on some level
[35:10] self-deception for if any be a hearer of
[35:12] the word and not a doer he is like unto
[35:14] a man beholding his natural face in a
[35:17] glass so if a man hears the word of God
[35:20] but in turn does not translated into
[35:22] action does not live it does not do it
[35:24] does not fulfill it does not perform it
[35:26] he is like a man who is looking looking
[35:28] should be looking into the word with
[35:30] open face beholding as in a mirror of
[35:32] the glory of the Lord but in this way he
[35:34] looks as a man into a mirror but only
[35:37] sees his natural
[35:39] face his natural face for he beholdeth
[35:43] himself and goeth his way and
[35:45] straightway forgiveth what manner of man
[35:48] he
[35:49] was there that there is no change in
[35:53] conduct there's no subsequent uh
[35:55] changing Paul said that we when we have
[35:57] the spirit Lord inside of us and the
[35:58] word is being revealed to us the the
[36:00] nature of this Liberty is that we would
[36:02] behold to the glory of the Lord and be
[36:04] changed in the image of the Lord by that
[36:07] Spirit of the Lord but now one looks
[36:09] into the mirror sees himself and since
[36:11] he hears but will not do he goes
[36:14] straight way and forgets what Manner he
[36:16] was he stays the same he does not change
[36:19] amen says but who so lookth into the
[36:22] perfect law of Liberty and continueth
[36:25] therein he being not a forgiven ful here
[36:28] but a doer of the work that phrase the
[36:31] doer of the work the work of what the
[36:34] perfect law of Liberty the work of what
[36:37] the very thing that's being revealed to
[36:39] you that work of the Lord this process
[36:41] of change from glory to glory being
[36:43] changed by the spirit of Lord into the
[36:45] image of Christ he being not a forgetful
[36:48] hearer but a doer of the work this man
[36:50] shall be blessed in his
[36:52] deed If any man among you seem to be
[36:54] religious and bridleth not his tongue
[36:56] but but deceiveth his own heart this
[36:58] man's religion is
[37:00] vain pure religion and undefiled before
[37:04] God and the father is this to visit the
[37:06] fatherless and the widows in their
[37:08] Affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[37:12] from the
[37:13] world now I want to continue into
[37:15] chapter two but look at where Paul is
[37:20] excuse me James is has led us to where
[37:23] the spirit of the Lord which is in you
[37:27] there there's
[37:28] liberty but if I am not ultimately
[37:31] obedient to the word of God I've
[37:33] deceived
[37:35] myself that claiming to be the bearer of
[37:38] his presence claiming to have the word
[37:40] of God inside of me claiming to have his
[37:42] spirit inside of me but yet I'm not
[37:44] being changed into the same image I'm
[37:46] not being a doer of the word then I have
[37:49] deceived myself but when the spirit of
[37:52] the Lord is in my heart and i gaze upon
[37:54] that word I see it it's revealed to me
[37:56] and I obey he says you're not a
[37:58] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[38:02] and I'm blessed in my
[38:04] doing and this is built around this uh
[38:09] these instructions from James to this is
[38:11] what you ought to do this is what you
[38:13] ought to do be a doer of the word not
[38:14] just a hearer as James is going to say
[38:17] show me your faith by your works and
[38:20] look at it from a different perspective
[38:22] than that of Paul who said uh my faith
[38:24] is made manifest before God apart from
[38:26] my works
[38:30] and he says pure religion is to before
[38:33] God and that which is undefiled is to
[38:35] visit the fatherless and the widows in
[38:36] their Affliction and to keep ourselves
[38:38] unspotted from the world there's a
[38:40] certain Duty and
[38:43] responsibility in this perfect law of
[38:45] Liberty he's saying quite a bit about
[38:47] what we ought to
[38:50] do so he continues in chapter 2: 1-13 my
[38:54] brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord
[38:55] Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with
[38:57] respect of
[38:59] persons for if there come unto your
[39:01] assembly a man with a gold ring and
[39:03] goodly apparel and there come ALS and
[39:06] also a poor man in Vile reignment and
[39:08] you have respect to him that weareth the
[39:10] gay clothing and say unto him sit thou
[39:12] here in a good place and say to the poor
[39:14] stand thou there or sit here under my
[39:16] foot stol notice
[39:20] this talking about attitudes I think we
[39:22] preached on without prejudice on this
[39:25] very these very scriptures are ye not
[39:26] then partial in yourselves and are
[39:28] become judges of evil thoughts you're
[39:30] not rightly dividing the word of Truth
[39:32] and you're not acting in a manner that's
[39:33] consistent with how you ought to be in
[39:35] your faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:37] that you have a carnal means of
[39:38] elevating certain people and putting
[39:40] other people
[39:41] down to give certain people Liberties
[39:44] and privileges but others you take them
[39:45] away and deprive them hearken my beloved
[39:47] Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of
[39:50] this world rich in faith and The Heirs
[39:51] of the Kingdom which have promised to
[39:53] them that love him but ye have despised
[39:55] the poor do not rich men oppress you and
[39:59] draw you before judge the Judgment seats
[40:01] do not they blaspheme that worthy Name
[40:03] by which you are
[40:05] called if ye fulfill the Royal law
[40:09] according to the scripture Thou shalt
[40:11] love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well
[40:14] it's a common refrain it's a a a
[40:17] repetitive theme in Christ and Paul
[40:19] James that to love thy neighbor as
[40:23] thyself it's a it sums it up amen
[40:27] but if you have respect to persons you
[40:29] commit sin and are convinced of the
[40:32] Law's transgressors for who so shall
[40:34] keep the whole law and yet offended one
[40:36] point he is guilty of all for he that
[40:39] said do not commit adultery said also do
[40:41] not kill now if thou commit no adultery
[40:43] yet if thou kill Thou Art become a
[40:45] transgressor of the
[40:46] law there's a lot to unpack there but he
[40:49] says so speak ye and so
[40:52] do there's a manner of speaking and
[40:55] there is a manner of doing that we ought
[40:56] to speak right we ought to do right and
[40:58] as they that shall be judged by the law
[41:01] of Liberty speak ye and do as those that
[41:05] will be judged by the law of Liberty for
[41:09] you shall have judgment without
[41:11] Mercy for he shall have judgment without
[41:13] Mercy that has showed no mercy and mercy
[41:16] rejoiceth against
[41:19] judgment you could see then as James
[41:23] addresses
[41:25] this and he tells us that when we look
[41:28] into the perfect law of Liberty and
[41:30] continue
[41:31] therein we are a doer of the work and we
[41:35] are blessed in our deeds and we have not
[41:38] forgotten what we
[41:40] heard this looking into the perfect law
[41:43] of Liberty and this change that is
[41:44] brought about into a person is like
[41:47] what Paul said would happen where the
[41:50] spirit of the Lord is there's
[41:52] liberty that perfect
[41:55] Liberty is Christ right go it is the
[42:00] gospel it is the word it is the glory of
[42:02] the
[42:03] Lord it is the word which is perfect and
[42:07] perfecting causing us therefore to walk
[42:10] in
[42:11] Liberty and what James says is
[42:16] that whoo lookth into the perfect law of
[42:20] Liberty I'm I going to say this and I'm
[42:23] closing we must be looking into
[42:27] the perfect law of
[42:29] Liberty studying this word looking this
[42:31] week it mean it comes from this the
[42:34] Greek word to stoop down and take a
[42:36] close look into it's used literally in
[42:39] the sense of Peter stooping down going
[42:42] into the Seiler going into the tomb to
[42:44] get a closer look to apprehend for
[42:47] himself what it really is looking into
[42:49] the perfect law of Liberty is not just a
[42:51] glance it's not just a a a scene of
[42:55] something it's the fixing of whole mind
[42:58] on the mirror of the word that has been
[43:00] revealed to us the the the setting of
[43:03] our attention to the giving of
[43:04] preeminence to it letting that become
[43:06] our Guiding
[43:11] Light I was reading in Patrick
[43:15] Henry's uh speech on Give me liberty or
[43:17] give me death and he said I have no lamp
[43:20] to my feet but experience and I thought
[43:22] man this is such a rousing speech that
[43:25] wasn't necessarily recorded at the time
[43:26] but was published sometime later and I
[43:28] thought well I think I would moderate
[43:29] that a little little bit we ought to not
[43:32] have any other lampen to our feet than
[43:35] the word of God that has been revealed
[43:37] to
[43:38] us and not just experience as our
[43:41] guidepost and our and our Plum
[43:44] line so he says that we ought to look
[43:47] into to diligently inquire of into the
[43:52] perfect law of Liberty there is a
[43:55] perfect Liberty this is I want to get
[43:57] across today and using the example of
[43:59] the imperfect Liberty perhaps with
[44:01] respect to American society and
[44:03] democracy and the and what we have in
[44:05] America still the best there is but yet
[44:08] with imperfect men and they wrestled
[44:10] with this no these Notions even in the
[44:12] founding documents that uh we're
[44:14] imperfect and this is the best we can do
[44:16] and this is the best that we could come
[44:18] up with and yeah maybe it'll last for a
[44:20] while and eventually become tyranny and
[44:22] we may have have to again dissolve these
[44:25] things and set up a new government uh
[44:27] here they were uh pursuing
[44:30] freedom and be declaring their
[44:32] independence on the the basis of Liberty
[44:35] knowing that Liberty itself from a human
[44:38] standpoint has its
[44:42] limits but perfect Liberty James said
[44:45] there is a perfect law of Liberty he
[44:47] calls it the law of Liberty it's perfect
[44:51] Liberty this looking into the word of
[44:53] God where the spirit of the Lord is
[44:54] there is liberty so therefore we we must
[44:57] look into the revealed word which
[44:59] belongs to us all look into it unless we
[45:03] think that it's momentary or
[45:07] fleeting if we think that well look into
[45:09] it and it's just kind of a happen stance
[45:11] or a glance or having read it once he
[45:13] says continue
[45:15] therein continue in seeking Revelation
[45:18] continue in receiving Revelation
[45:20] continue in performing that which has
[45:22] been revealed to you continue therein
[45:25] and being a doer of what has been
[45:27] revealed to you that we would just not
[45:29] as he said go our
[45:31] way having heard the word just leave
[45:34] kind of go our way but continue in what
[45:36] he's
[45:37] revealed that we are to be a doer of the
[45:40] work one who is performing his perfect
[45:43] will which has been made known unto me
[45:46] that there is a work that I am to do yes
[45:50] amen there is a perfect
[45:53] Liberty there is uh as brother say
[45:57] casting aside all superstitions and all
[45:58] peculiar confessions of Faith let us let
[46:01] us hold fast to that revealed word which
[46:04] belongs to us
[46:06] all but just as democracy has been
[46:10] corrupted because of this ideas of
[46:13] Liberty we must not allow our Liberty to
[46:18] become defiled through Satan's
[46:22] beguiling there is a perfect
[46:25] Liberty but this
[46:28] concept of
[46:31] Liberty it is freedom to
[46:39] become in these two places that we use
[46:42] this concept of
[46:43] Liberty I believe we've identified very
[46:46] particularly that it wasn't you're free
[46:49] now to do what you want in the old
[46:53] time that you're not just you're free
[46:56] you're free now and that we can turn the
[47:00] word of God into a grab
[47:01] bag and just say I'm free to do this I'm
[47:05] free to do that I'm free to do this why
[47:07] because where the spirit of the Lord is
[47:09] there's
[47:10] liberty and when in fact you are not
[47:13] exercising Liberty you've deceived
[47:18] yourself because where the spirit of the
[47:20] Lord there's liberty but in 1
[47:22] Corinthians 6:19 it says know you not
[47:24] that your body is the Temple of the Holy
[47:26] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[47:28] God and ye are not your own yes right
[47:35] this very concept of
[47:37] Liberty is not a ship without an anchor
[47:42] it's not all sales and no anchor it is
[47:45] something that is greater than our
[47:48] humanities greater than our politics
[47:50] greater than our our our ways and our
[47:52] our philosophies and trying to figure
[47:54] things out it is the individual coming
[47:57] to know something Beyond themselves the
[47:59] Creator it's the mind of Christ having
[48:02] preeminence in us it is the right way to
[48:04] live wherein you can exercise all the
[48:07] Liberties you have without depriving
[48:09] anyone else of their Liberties it's
[48:12] having Liberty without taking other
[48:14] people's Liberties let me say this in
[48:16] closing musicians you can come to your
[48:18] instruments that there are things that
[48:21] we can have as Americans and there are
[48:23] Liberties that we can take as Christians
[48:25] and there are things that we can do
[48:26] because all things are lawful to us and
[48:28] we can exercise those Liberties but let
[48:31] us not confuse those things that we want
[48:34] to do in our flesh as being the things
[48:36] that we ought to do in the liberty of
[48:40] Christ that is if we are to be free our
[48:43] freedom is to be loosed from the
[48:47] constraints of human thinking and
[48:48] Humanity to be loosed from Traditions
[48:51] but it doesn't mean that every man lives
[48:53] on his own but we all with open face
[48:56] beholding the the same revealed word
[48:58] will be changed to the very same image
[49:00] because our body is not our own it is
[49:02] his therefore my Liberty and I want to
[49:05] emphasize this on Sunday my Liberty
[49:07] isn't just to do anything I want to it's
[49:10] to do as I ought
[49:12] to so therefore if we change the
[49:14] definition of Liberty we've changed the
[49:17] definition of righteousness we've
[49:18] changed the definition of
[49:20] Christ and we're preaching another
[49:23] gospel so Lord help us to be
[49:31] free
[49:32] maybe I I'll just say there's a there
[49:35] was a famous rolling stone song I'm free
[49:39] anybody remember that song anybody
[49:40] remember good we're just when a good
[49:42] group of sanctified people tonight maybe
[49:44] the soup dragons do you remember their
[49:46] cover of that hit I was just doing some
[49:49] research on it and I when I got to this
[49:52] part I I didn't listen to any of it uh
[49:55] but in these lyrics I'm free to do
[49:58] whatever I want any old time so love me
[50:00] and there's this idea I'm free I'm free
[50:02] I'm free and when a group later on in
[50:04] the 90s did a cover of it they in in the
[50:07] in the way that they set it forth they
[50:09] there's this refrain in it I'm free to
[50:11] do whatever I want it's the same old
[50:13] rock and roll song the same old
[50:14] inspiration from below and it goes I'm a
[50:16] new creation
[50:18] uh it's like
[50:20] whoa It's there's some borrowing from
[50:24] this
[50:25] idea of being
[50:27] free I'm a new creature I've been
[50:30] loosed I I've been set free and then
[50:33] this I this sense of being
[50:36] liberated I I I I have a right then to
[50:39] do these things and to express these
[50:41] things and express myself in a certain
[50:44] way but I believe when we make those
[50:46] things when we make our
[50:49] indulgences an expression of true
[50:51] Liberty we typically want to imprison
[50:55] those that don't share in this the same
[50:58] Indulgence and that's very dangerous
[51:01] it's very dangerous God bless you
[51:04] tonight if you could just stand with me
