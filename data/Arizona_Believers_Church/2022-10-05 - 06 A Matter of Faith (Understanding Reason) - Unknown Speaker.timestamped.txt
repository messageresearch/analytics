[0:00] and my subtitle today is uh
[0:03] understanding reasons our title is a
[0:07] matter of faith and subtitle is
[0:10] understanding reason
[0:11] and I'll say this
[0:14] um
[0:14] at the outset as a
[0:17] uh not a thesis statement but I'm going
[0:21] to be very careful I feel like I'm kind
[0:22] of walking a tightrope maybe this maybe
[0:24] how I felt even in the subject matter
[0:26] because there are ditches on each side
[0:28] of the road that you have to be careful
[0:30] of but I'm wanting to look at the role
[0:32] of knowledge wisdom understanding and
[0:35] reason as it relates to Faith because
[0:37] there's certainly a way that we could
[0:39] say there's faith and then everything
[0:40] else and so we have faith and we throw
[0:42] out the window knowledge wisdom and
[0:44] understanding and reason
[0:45] and there is I would say a false
[0:48] division or dichotomy between faith and
[0:51] reason and that false dichotomy is one
[0:54] that always takes reason and faith and
[0:56] makes them enemies or makes them Rivals
[0:58] and pits them against each other in such
[1:00] a way to where you have uh um rivalry or
[1:03] enemies against each other
[1:05] and I would say there is a proper
[1:06] distinction
[1:07] and a proper placing but there's a false
[1:10] way that you could position them you can
[1:12] take Faith you could take reason and
[1:14] position them in the false way and and I
[1:17] trust that here at the outset with some
[1:18] of these introductory statements as we
[1:20] have it Amplified with a little bit of
[1:23] an echo that it'll have a greater impact
[1:25] but uh
[1:26] I want you to just hold real tight to
[1:28] what I'm saying in the beginning because
[1:29] it can be very important as we go
[1:31] forward and I don't think this will be
[1:32] mentally taxing tonight but I want you
[1:35] to be focused very intently because I'm
[1:37] going to be saying things uh that if
[1:39] you're if you're not listening and it's
[1:41] not building could be easy for you to
[1:43] slip to the one side and not really
[1:44] catch what we're trying to express and
[1:47] so let me say it this way at the outset
[1:48] as I say there could be a false
[1:50] dichotomy of what faith is and what
[1:51] reason is so there's a there's a way
[1:53] that you could present them in a false
[1:54] way or pit them against one another
[1:57] and the world pushes a narrative this is
[2:00] going to be important to catch at the
[2:01] very beginning the world pushes a
[2:03] narrative that faith is void of reason
[2:06] and in doing so they misrepresent
[2:08] Christianity so they kind of take
[2:10] Christians and they say we're there
[2:11] they're brainwashed or they're they
[2:13] choose not to exercise their minds and
[2:16] they choose not to to use reason and
[2:18] they're intellectually dull and there's
[2:20] a way that they try to paint
[2:21] Christianity or misrepresent
[2:22] Christianity by pushing a narrative that
[2:25] faith is absent or void or has nothing
[2:28] to do with or no connection or
[2:31] relationship to reason
[2:32] and then on the other hand maybe even
[2:35] accepting that narrative or as a
[2:38] pushback against it Christians almost
[2:40] are willing to bear that mantle and say
[2:43] that's right and nominal Christianity in
[2:45] many ways has let go of reason and has
[2:48] let go of understanding and so in that
[2:51] and I'm moving very quickly today in
[2:54] that because you could have one side
[2:55] that says there is a faith and reason
[2:57] our Arch enemies and and faith is void
[3:00] of reason and the world tries to present
[3:02] that to make Christians look as if
[3:04] they're ignorant they're dumb and
[3:05] they're not and they don't understand
[3:07] and they just accept things without any
[3:09] thought process whatsoever and then on
[3:11] the other hand Christians maybe say
[3:13] that's right you know we just go by
[3:14] faith and faith alone and in doing so
[3:17] separate themselves from reason and
[3:19] understanding there's uh there's sides
[3:22] that people take even with respect to
[3:24] and within Christianity itself
[3:27] and so what happens is and we could
[3:29] these are maybe broad categories that
[3:31] might not maybe seem to be over
[3:33] simplistic but we can certainly identify
[3:35] this that within Christianity there
[3:37] becomes a divide and I think it's
[3:38] getting bigger and bigger kind of in the
[3:40] nominal realm but I think you'll
[3:41] recognize this that there's the side
[3:44] that's intellectual and then there's a
[3:45] side that's emotional so there's people
[3:47] very fundamental very intellectual uh uh
[3:50] you know and and they present themselves
[3:52] maybe in an academic theological way
[3:54] that's their theology that's the
[3:56] exercise of their faith it's in an
[3:57] intellectual sense but then you have the
[3:59] other side that's more charismatic uh
[4:01] maybe more Evangelical and they are more
[4:03] the more emotional side and So within
[4:06] Christianity you kind of have this
[4:07] divide even today with the nominal
[4:09] Christianity of the intellectual side
[4:11] and the emotional side
[4:13] and brother Branagh makes these two
[4:15] statements that highlight this he says
[4:17] the Full Gospel Church is divided in two
[4:19] ways right now one of them is getting
[4:21] cold formal and indifferent he says a
[4:23] danger line right so cold formal and
[4:25] different is a danger line the next
[4:27] one's getting a bunch of all kinds of
[4:29] Mystic here and high things that's not
[4:32] even scriptural so so he's saying one's
[4:34] a danger line and the other's a danger
[4:36] line one is so cold formal and
[4:38] legalistic or indifferent that they've
[4:40] created a danger line but then the other
[4:42] side has gone off into a bunch of
[4:43] mysticism and a bunch of high things
[4:45] that's not even scriptural right because
[4:47] they're kind of if I'm really getting
[4:49] deep within my thought they piggyback on
[4:52] this idea of a mysterious God and
[4:54] knowing things by faith so they can
[4:56] present things that really have no basis
[4:59] nothing that can be verified and they
[5:02] push things and it's kind of a mysticism
[5:04] even to the people that believe it
[5:07] because they've kind of co-opted certain
[5:09] things within the word of God and it's
[5:11] become untethered from a real solid base
[5:13] and so they go off into this other side
[5:15] and he says
[5:17] uh he says stay right he says watch it
[5:19] stay right in the middle of the road
[5:21] brother
[5:22] so there's a danger line on each side
[5:24] and he's saying there's some that have
[5:25] gone off in this mysticism there's
[5:27] others that go off in this cold dead
[5:28] formalism and he's saying stay in the
[5:30] middle of the road
[5:32] and he says in another place and that's
[5:33] about the way churches have got just
[5:36] took in a bunch under cold formal
[5:38] profession
[5:39] some Mystic dance or some sensation
[5:42] so there's the two sides you have one
[5:44] that's got a cold formal profession but
[5:46] then another that has some sort of
[5:47] Mystic dance or some sensation it spills
[5:50] over to the other side and what did they
[5:52] do disbelieve the word so we got a nest
[5:55] full of rotten eggs it's kind of that
[5:57] idea of having not been with uh um the
[6:00] seed you know having not been birthed
[6:01] the proper birth
[6:03] now
[6:05] in each one of those conditions you have
[6:07] the cold formalism or the kind of the
[6:10] intellectualism
[6:11] or the emotional side both conditions
[6:14] are not the characteristic of true faith
[6:18] and and they have their they have their
[6:20] residence uh in another realm I think I
[6:22] have that slide by the Chris that maybe
[6:24] shows the body uh spirit soul I kind of
[6:26] put it in there at the last minute uh
[6:28] just so we could look at this if you
[6:30] recall the last time we ministered on
[6:31] this subject a couple Wednesdays ago we
[6:33] were taking that um breakdown of the
[6:36] human who is Body Spirit Souls you have
[6:38] this body that has the senses that are
[6:40] outlined there you have a spirit the
[6:42] mind the heart the emotions the thinking
[6:44] and then you have the soul this would be
[6:46] the representation of a person who is
[6:48] born again who in their soul has only
[6:51] one sense its faith
[6:52] and so this idea or this emotionalism
[6:57] and even the formalism they reside
[7:00] solely within the realm of the spirit
[7:02] and you could say maybe expressing
[7:04] itself within the body but that's all it
[7:06] exists within is in that Spirit of the
[7:08] man and that's why we could call it
[7:11] intellectual faith emotionalism and and
[7:13] formalism are both fruits of an
[7:15] intellectual faith not a soul faith a
[7:18] carnal Faith a human faith and someone
[7:20] can look at the word of God and hear
[7:22] things and see things and believe things
[7:24] and all they're doing is using their
[7:26] human part to grab a hold of something
[7:29] and exercise it or use it or believe it
[7:31] or look to it and the only and those are
[7:33] the those are the extremes that you can
[7:34] fall into emotionalism or formalism but
[7:37] both are intellectual faith
[7:40] think about that because there's a way
[7:41] that not that often it's expressed this
[7:43] way that intellectual faith is the cold
[7:46] formal Ted Talk teachers and people who
[7:49] only teach the word and talk about the
[7:51] word only and and don't believe in the
[7:53] gifts and don't manifest themselves in
[7:55] signs and wonders and miracles and they
[7:57] say that's intellectual Faith but
[7:58] intellectual faith is also emotional
[8:02] charismatic and can and and effusive
[8:05] about certain things and and maybe by
[8:08] Optics are very different in their
[8:09] mannerisms and the way they conduct
[8:10] themselves but both of them are
[8:12] intellectual faith
[8:14] because the devil would love to be able
[8:16] to characterize one as being indicative
[8:18] of
[8:19] intellectual Faith so that if you see
[8:21] the other you just say oh well then that
[8:23] that's the real deal that's the soul
[8:24] Faith but both can manifest in
[8:27] intellectual faith
[8:28] and so when we think of intellectual
[8:30] Faith it's born solely from the human
[8:33] emotions and that Spirit realm that mind
[8:35] and it goes no deeper
[8:38] it goes no deeper to that faith that we
[8:39] as we have it represented here yeah we
[8:42] could put it at the top of his headship
[8:43] but we put it here at the bottom as it's
[8:45] undergirding everything it's that
[8:46] Foundation it's the it works all within
[8:49] that
[8:49] and so
[8:51] this I know they were just sharing
[8:52] principle after principle tonight
[8:54] intellectual faith can be cold formal
[8:57] can be dead or it can be emotional and
[9:00] fanatical
[9:01] it can be legalistic or it can be a
[9:03] licentious it can be a license because
[9:06] it's all within the human realm and it
[9:09] can operate within the bounds of how a
[9:12] human could think and act
[9:13] whatever whatever personality gets a
[9:15] hold of it and it could express itself
[9:17] and very energetic very charismatic but
[9:19] it also be very cold and very formal and
[9:22] all it is is just the human part the
[9:24] intellectual part
[9:26] a few statements here I think I have
[9:28] three statements here to read to you at
[9:29] the outset to recognize how brother
[9:32] Branham even divided this because I
[9:33] believe it's extremely helpful to us to
[9:35] see this better man says a man could
[9:37] have an intellectual faith and there's
[9:39] where most people today calling
[9:41] themselves Christians the reason you see
[9:43] such carrying on as they do under the
[9:45] name of Christianity it's only
[9:47] intellectual faith
[9:49] so even that carrying on is an
[9:51] intellectual Faith what do you mean by
[9:52] intellectual faith brother this is it
[9:55] man believeth unto salvation now Faith
[9:58] cometh by hearing hearing of the word
[9:59] say just using this phrase here he says
[10:01] now I could preach the word
[10:03] you could accept and say that's all
[10:05] right yeah I believe that well now if
[10:07] that's all the father it ever goes
[10:10] it's if it's only ascented to in the
[10:13] mind and it ever goes deeper to the soul
[10:15] or we could even use the phrase heart
[10:16] that never goes deeper than that he says
[10:18] then you'll never get very far with God
[10:21] he says intellectual faith
[10:24] so it's ascending even to something
[10:25] that's true but except in it only
[10:27] intellectually as long as you've only
[10:30] accepted it intellectually it's subject
[10:33] to reason
[10:35] because it's not in the soul which is
[10:38] only one one sense its Faith so as long
[10:40] as it's in that realm and he brings this
[10:42] out I think it's in these few statements
[10:44] we have here or you'll catch that theme
[10:45] as we go on that's the reason
[10:48] people don't get healed is because they
[10:50] only have an intellectual view of it
[10:52] what their mind conceives but the mind
[10:55] will reason
[10:56] so you can accept it yeah I believe in
[10:59] my healing but if it never goes any
[11:00] deeper as it exists there within the
[11:03] mind there's these other voices that go
[11:05] but I don't know if you're feeling any
[11:06] better
[11:07] or well the doctor says this is a pretty
[11:10] bad case and so it's in there and you
[11:12] really want to believe it you're like oh
[11:13] no no I believe it no no I believe it
[11:15] and then after a while you kind of it's
[11:17] peer pressure in your head right there's
[11:19] so many other voices like okay well
[11:22] maybe I should listen to these other
[11:23] voices in my head and there's a little
[11:25] bit of a loosening because it's all
[11:27] within your emotional Realm
[11:30] it says the mind will say it cannot be
[11:33] I'm no better my sense of sight says
[11:35] marm is no straighter than it was
[11:36] yesterday my sense of feeling says I
[11:38] don't feel any different than I did
[11:39] yesterday reasoning mental theology will
[11:42] reason out and say well now wait a
[11:44] minute I believe that's foolishness see
[11:47] your reasoning that intellectual faith
[11:50] will do that
[11:52] and there is uh there can be uh
[11:56] an improper conflation of reason and
[11:59] reasoning
[12:00] and even in terms of making an argument
[12:03] and being convincing and setting
[12:05] something out you can have reason and
[12:06] then reasoning and so there's this is
[12:09] where the problem is is in the reasoning
[12:11] there's a reasoning with it he says this
[12:13] reasoning uh that's intellectual faith
[12:15] that will begin to reason then and I
[12:17] have heard but now see he says then
[12:19] faith has a channel to move into I think
[12:20] we've been reading this lately he says
[12:22] if it doesn't then you've got mental
[12:24] intellectual faith not genuine Faith
[12:26] from God
[12:27] that intellectual faith will get you
[12:29] nowhere might get you emotional so he's
[12:31] saying yeah maybe somewhere might get
[12:32] you emotional but it won't get you the
[12:34] healing that you're looking for so
[12:36] intellectual Faith Can can manifest
[12:39] itself an emotion and certain feelings
[12:41] and convictions but he's saying it it
[12:43] doesn't bring that permanence it doesn't
[12:45] bring that final outcome that you're
[12:47] looking for because faith it hasn't
[12:49] opened up that channel into the soul
[12:52] then in the sermon God keeps his word he
[12:54] says now just a moment is it in the into
[12:57] prayer uh wanting to pray for the sick
[12:59] everyone be reverent don't move stand
[13:01] still pray with all your heart now don't
[13:04] be emotionally
[13:06] in other words don't get emotional have
[13:08] faith unique he's presenting those two
[13:11] together because one is it one is that
[13:14] danger there's this danger line of if
[13:17] you cry if you feel it if you get
[13:19] emotional he says don't get emotional
[13:21] have faith your emotions will never
[13:23] build he says it'll build a material
[13:26] intellectual faith
[13:28] he says but it'll never build a faith in
[13:30] your heart let the word sink down just
[13:32] believe God if you if thou can't believe
[13:34] all things are possible
[13:36] so that's just a few statements to
[13:38] recognize that that intellectual faith
[13:41] and how it can move within the sense of
[13:44] feeling and even the sense of logic and
[13:46] reasoning and it only exists within the
[13:48] realm of the body and the mind the
[13:50] senses of the body and the spirit as it
[13:52] gives information and the mind begins to
[13:54] process it and reason it out and so it
[13:57] this intellectual Faith we're using that
[13:59] as a phrase just to kind of help us move
[14:01] along because we could categorize so
[14:02] many things by it I think we've called
[14:03] it mental Faith or emotional Faith it's
[14:06] characterized by either a
[14:09] a religious rationalism where there's uh
[14:13] there is it's a religious uh expression
[14:16] of well it must be by Logic and it must
[14:18] be academic and it must be figured out
[14:20] or kind of this religious emotionalism
[14:23] for one for the one side this kind of
[14:26] this religious rationalism they would
[14:28] say that reason is the ultimate
[14:30] Authority that that's what we go by is
[14:32] reason and they have a very strict maybe
[14:34] even approach to scripture and it has to
[14:36] be historical you have to examine it by
[14:38] its original language and you have to do
[14:40] this and they use that rigorous process
[14:42] to achieve a result that they now say
[14:45] because we've exercised this examination
[14:49] of the scripture and we've used this
[14:51] thought process and they've got all
[14:53] sorts of fancy words to describe it then
[14:55] this is how we've ended up with this and
[14:57] so reason is the ultimate Authority
[14:59] whereas on the other side experience
[15:01] becomes the absolute
[15:03] they're looking merely to what they've
[15:05] experienced and what they felt and they
[15:07] said all right it doesn't matter what
[15:08] you say this is what I've experienced it
[15:09] doesn't matter what this says this is
[15:10] what I felt doesn't matter what you say
[15:12] this is what I'm feeling this is we like
[15:14] this expression and this enthusiasm and
[15:16] we get results don't we and and the way
[15:18] that they feel and that's this is just
[15:20] within the Realms of Christianity
[15:23] now let's look at that uh that dichotomy
[15:27] and I realize now maybe presenting
[15:29] different divisions that you have on one
[15:32] level the world that wants to take Faith
[15:34] and reason and pit them against each
[15:36] other and say our Christians are just
[15:38] void of they're they're dumb they're
[15:40] dulled down they're being brainwashed
[15:41] they just accepted these things and and
[15:44] it's laziness or whatever and they kind
[15:46] of put in that category and then that
[15:48] kind of mindset is even within the
[15:50] Realms of Christianity where you have
[15:52] some that want to be extremely rational
[15:54] and some that want to be extremely
[15:55] irrational
[15:58] and it's all in its and it happens
[16:00] because there's no real Soul faith
[16:02] now this is Paul bringing these things
[16:05] out and I think he kind of nails this
[16:07] and is using a language
[16:09] uh that can be real tight to us
[16:12] he says for the preacher of the Cross is
[16:13] to them that perish foolishness right
[16:15] First Corinthians 1 18. but us which are
[16:18] saved it is the power of God so
[16:20] preaching the word to the world is like
[16:22] that's crazy right even to the world
[16:25] today I was even say maybe two modern
[16:27] Christians today be like why is that guy
[16:29] wearing a suit and tie you know can he
[16:31] get us can he get a hold of some Yeezys
[16:33] or something and a pair of blue jeans
[16:35] and a a linen shirt or something come
[16:38] and mix it up there dude and uh and so
[16:40] there's just a way that there's a way
[16:42] that preaching just looks foolish
[16:43] there's a way that even the exercise of
[16:45] taking scripture and ministering things
[16:47] is foolishness and so the preaching of
[16:49] the Cross to those that are lost and to
[16:52] those who will perish its foolishness
[16:54] but to those who ordained to Salvation
[16:56] it's like this is the power of God
[16:59] now it's important to say recognize this
[17:02] that not we're not just giving lip
[17:03] service to it but to the save there is
[17:06] this reality that these things relate to
[17:10] the Divine the highest power
[17:13] the greatest in verse 19 for it is
[17:15] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[17:17] wise and bring to nothing the
[17:18] understanding of The Prudent now we
[17:20] could take that and we can say oh see
[17:22] there if you're wise you're going to be
[17:23] destroyed if you have understandings can
[17:25] be brought to nothing if you're prudent
[17:26] if you're wise if you if you're
[17:28] perceptive these things are going to be
[17:29] destroyed and you'll be laid waste but
[17:31] he's talking about that which is solely
[17:34] the wisdom of this world
[17:36] he says where is the wise where's the
[17:38] Scribe where's the disputer of this
[17:40] world the one that believes solely in
[17:43] logic and rigorous training and
[17:45] intellectualism and those things he says
[17:47] hath not God made foolish the wisdom of
[17:49] this world so there is a wisdom versus
[17:52] Faith but that wisdom is solely and only
[17:56] worldly wisdom
[18:00] for after that in the wisdom of God so
[18:02] now there is a a true wisdom the World
[18:04] by wisdom knew not God
[18:06] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[18:08] World by wisdom knew not God it pleased
[18:10] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[18:11] save them that believe it is a mouthful
[18:14] but there is a wisdom of God and the
[18:16] World by its wisdom knows not the wisdom
[18:19] of God
[18:20] verse 22 for the Jews require a sign in
[18:23] the Greek seek after wisdom see now you
[18:25] have even in this way you have maybe the
[18:27] Jews who are looking for something
[18:29] physical looking for something tangible
[18:31] they they're gonna they're gonna operate
[18:34] and react to something totally different
[18:35] whereas the Greek's going to be maybe
[18:37] looking more the the philosophical side
[18:39] the wisdom side the intellectual side
[18:41] and Paul says but we preach Christ
[18:43] crucified
[18:44] we need not cater to either one we
[18:46] preach Christ crucified which is in
[18:49] itself a sign
[18:52] which it is in itself the wisdom of God
[18:53] under the Jews it's a stumbling block
[18:55] under the Greeks it's foolishness but
[18:57] yet it is truth
[18:59] so one thing to remember
[19:01] and to keep in mind is we're kind of
[19:03] going down this line of understanding
[19:05] reason and I think it's maybe a little
[19:06] catchy right understanding reason that
[19:09] all truth is God's truth
[19:13] all truth is God's truth and so there's
[19:16] this stigma that can be placed on things
[19:18] but all truth is God's truth and so this
[19:20] is but to the Jews it's a stumbling
[19:22] about to the Greek's foolishness but
[19:23] unto them which are called whether they
[19:25] be Jews or Greeks both Jews and Greeks
[19:28] Christ the power of God and the wisdom
[19:30] of God this is the power of God this is
[19:32] the wisdom of God because the
[19:34] foolishness of God is wiser than men and
[19:36] the weakness of God is stronger than men
[19:39] not that there is foolishness with God
[19:40] not that there is weakness with God but
[19:42] that is how the world perceives it right
[19:44] the world perceives it as foolishness
[19:46] the world perceives it as weakness if
[19:48] we're not careful as Christians we want
[19:50] to proceed be perceived as foolish and
[19:52] weak on our own terms as the world would
[19:55] want to see it and we've missed it
[19:58] because we we bought into this idea
[20:00] Christians are dumb Christians are
[20:02] ignorant Christians are foolish
[20:03] Christians are weak and and but yet
[20:05] that's how the World Views you when
[20:06] you're in the truth not when you've
[20:08] tried to manufacture that
[20:11] and I would say this that even
[20:12] intellectually we can reason with these
[20:14] scriptures
[20:15] where pits wisdom versus God and
[20:18] knowledge and and these things as Paul
[20:20] even continuing with Paul and he's
[20:22] talking about how these things manifest
[20:24] in the glory of Lord and how he's
[20:25] confounding the wise with uh foolish
[20:28] things
[20:30] and there's a way that we could even
[20:32] wrestle with the principle and I say
[20:33] this because I believe it and brother
[20:35] Branham taught it that faith has no
[20:38] reason
[20:41] and and that has a meaning to it right
[20:44] faith has an Iranian it has a meaning to
[20:46] it and I think in the future services
[20:47] will be able to unpack that a little bit
[20:49] more but if we aren't careful with the
[20:52] things that we've read and even the
[20:53] things that we've kind of referenced I
[20:55] realize now that I had taken out quite a
[20:56] bit maybe that that look at this idea of
[20:59] reasoning and intellectual the being
[21:01] intelligent and thinking and these
[21:03] things uh maybe there's a stigma
[21:04] associated with it but if we're aren't
[21:06] careful
[21:07] we can reject very specific scriptural
[21:11] principles
[21:12] and even very important scriptural
[21:14] processes
[21:16] in Matthew chapter 12 verse 7 just going
[21:19] to read this it's I know it's kind of
[21:20] taken out of context a little bit or at
[21:22] least it's not within the context of the
[21:23] larger narrative but Jesus says but if
[21:25] you had known what this meaning I will
[21:28] have mercy and not sacrifice had you
[21:30] known had you understood if you knew
[21:32] what it meant when God said I will have
[21:34] mercy and not sacrifice you would not
[21:36] have condemned the Guiltless
[21:39] Jesus is saying if you if you understood
[21:42] the Commandment if you knew what it
[21:44] meant if you if you really had caught
[21:46] what he meant when he said it if you'd
[21:48] had kind of the reasoning the logos
[21:50] because there can be word which is Rima
[21:52] only it's just the spoken part it's
[21:54] maybe the semantic it's the part that
[21:56] carries the thought but all you're kind
[21:58] of grabbing onto is the the shell in the
[22:01] word itself but the thought behind it
[22:03] he's basically saying yeah you say all
[22:05] day long I'll have mercy and not
[22:07] sacrifice and you've accepted you're the
[22:09] Scribe you believe it you believe every
[22:10] word you've built a whole tradition and
[22:13] religion around the things that God had
[22:15] said but if you had only knew what it
[22:16] meant
[22:17] you wouldn't have condemned the
[22:18] Guiltless so he's identifying with the
[22:21] Jews despite all their wealth of
[22:23] knowledge and this and that maybe the
[22:26] the literal word that they had there was
[22:29] a lack of understanding if you knew what
[22:31] it meant there was a lack of knowledge
[22:33] about that
[22:35] and if I could say this not to use a
[22:37] buzzword brother Andrew and I were
[22:39] Fellowship in on this yesterday
[22:40] in a way they weren't they weren't
[22:43] really thinking I know maybe venturing
[22:46] into some dangerous territory but they
[22:48] weren't really thinking about the
[22:49] Commandments of God
[22:51] yeah I believe it yeah that's great I
[22:54] believe it but they're not thinking
[22:55] about it like if that's if God says that
[22:59] what does that mean
[23:02] what are what what is that what are the
[23:04] consequences of that or why would God
[23:06] feel that way and and in that way you're
[23:09] not questioning God like oh that's not
[23:11] God and why would he do that but you're
[23:12] wanting to know that if if God gives a
[23:15] commandment
[23:16] he's a god of reason he's a god of
[23:19] purpose he's a god of a higher
[23:21] intelligence and you're looking at just
[23:22] saying well I accept it and I believe it
[23:25] but in my heart I would real I really
[23:27] want to know your heart behind it I want
[23:30] to know your reason behind it
[23:32] and it was really a blessing to me uh
[23:35] this afternoon I had reached out to
[23:37] brother loyal and I said hey if you have
[23:38] a song on your heart
[23:39] it'd be wonderful if you could sing and
[23:41] excellent timing thank you and uh and so
[23:44] I was I just said if you have a song on
[23:47] your heart singing and he sent out a
[23:49] text message to the musicians and he
[23:51] asked them you know do you know the song
[23:52] Oh I want to know you more and I'm
[23:54] thinking oh wow
[23:56] awesome
[23:57] it was very think of the very words of
[23:59] those song of that song that I want to
[24:01] know you more deep within my soul I want
[24:04] to know you to fill your heart and know
[24:07] your mind
[24:08] that it warns my hungering to behold
[24:11] that there's there's this desire and
[24:13] even brother Michael saying uh more of
[24:15] you
[24:16] that there's this idea and say well I've
[24:18] accepted your word I believe your word
[24:20] but that's only given me an appetite
[24:23] that's only stirred up within me a
[24:25] hunger to know the one that spoke it to
[24:28] know the one that gave it to not just
[24:30] look at it on its surface like yep I got
[24:32] it and run out and try to mimic it or
[24:35] walk in it or just accept it
[24:36] intellectually but want to get down as
[24:39] Jesus said if you'd only know them known
[24:41] the meaning well I want to know the
[24:43] meaning I believe it but I want to know
[24:45] the meaning of it
[24:47] and so it's a lack of critical thinking
[24:49] maybe about the Commandments of God
[24:52] where there's no consideration there
[24:54] there's no deeper thought there's no
[24:56] wisdom that is birthed by it
[24:58] say ah I've caught them I I caught the
[25:01] understanding of that and then it leaves
[25:03] it loses that that rigorous legalistic
[25:08] way sometimes that we adhere to certain
[25:10] things and when we were very we're very
[25:13] diligent to do things but because we've
[25:17] kind of lost the wisdom of it we never
[25:19] really get the full benefit of it
[25:21] and we're never able to really advance
[25:23] in it because it's just it's by pure
[25:25] discipline it's by pure uh sweat and
[25:28] perspiration that we're adhering to the
[25:30] letter of the law instead of kind of
[25:32] catching the spirit of it and
[25:33] recognizing how that can then have a
[25:36] domino effect into other areas
[25:38] I think that's why so often people put a
[25:41] period on things and that's how
[25:42] denomination started is they just wanted
[25:44] to kind of have the be able to put it on
[25:46] their website right like these are this
[25:48] is what we believe period
[25:50] and then just stay within that instead
[25:52] of really understanding that these
[25:55] things if they're truth represent
[25:57] something that's Eternal Without End
[26:01] in Hosea chapter 4 verse 6 he says my
[26:04] people are destroyed for lack of
[26:05] knowledge
[26:07] because thou has rejected knowledge I
[26:08] will also reject thee
[26:11] that thou shalt be no priest to me see
[26:13] in thou has forgotten the law of God I
[26:15] will also forget thy children
[26:17] but notice how succinctly it's put my
[26:20] people are destroyed for lack of
[26:21] knowledge
[26:22] it's not characterized that my people
[26:25] are destroyed for lack of belief or lack
[26:27] of faith but it's a rejection of
[26:29] knowledge
[26:30] if Jesus says you had you only known
[26:33] what it meant to say I will have mercy
[26:35] and not sacrifice maybe it could be said
[26:37] that they believed what he said but they
[26:40] lacked the knowledge of what he said and
[26:42] because they lacked the deeper
[26:43] understanding of the principles of God
[26:45] they're destroyed and because they
[26:47] rejected digging deeper to know the
[26:49] heart of God behind his precepts and
[26:51] behind the law and behind the things he
[26:53] was expressing he says I will also
[26:55] reject thee
[26:57] there's this veneer there's this
[26:59] pretense that we could have in a
[27:00] religious sense where we just want
[27:02] everything to kind of check the box in
[27:04] terms of the the the the the the the the
[27:05] surface
[27:07] but we never have a desire to go beneath
[27:10] that
[27:10] and intellectually we can take great
[27:12] comfort in kind of just checking the
[27:14] boxes right God thought it brother man
[27:16] spoke it I believe it that settles it
[27:17] right just press play and Obey there's a
[27:19] there's a comfort level in that because
[27:20] man if salvation is just as easy as low
[27:22] two steps
[27:23] uh then then we figured it out but man
[27:26] what a total perversion of what it means
[27:29] to obey
[27:32] because they've don't know what it means
[27:34] or they're lack they're destroyed for a
[27:36] lack of knowledge
[27:37] now in Colossians chapter 1 verses 9 to
[27:39] 10 I've got three three verses here
[27:41] we're doing great tonight we have enough
[27:43] time to make it over to Freddy's
[27:45] and uh
[27:47] and people trying to read too much into
[27:49] my references to restaurants and they're
[27:50] wondering why I haven't mentioned ritos
[27:52] in a while
[27:53] but it doesn't mean I'm not thinking
[27:55] about ritos on a regular basis because
[27:57] Rito's has the best burritos right we
[28:00] all like greedos ritos ritos
[28:03] does that help we evened it out now
[28:05] Culver's isn't in the lead
[28:07] Colossians chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 he
[28:10] says now recognize these three verses
[28:11] we're gonna read three places in
[28:13] Colossians Ephesians and second
[28:14] Corinthians notice how Paul is alluding
[28:16] to let's just accept it on some level
[28:20] an intelligence a thinking a knowledge a
[28:24] wisdom a discernment a Justice a
[28:26] judgment of righteousness he says for
[28:28] this cause since the day we heard it do
[28:30] not cease to pray for you and to desire
[28:33] that ye might be filled with the
[28:35] knowledge of his will
[28:37] we want you to be filled with the
[28:40] knowledge of his will Paul's the one
[28:42] that hearkens back and he's the one that
[28:44] says I'm going to speaking from Isaiah
[28:47] I'm going to destroy the wisdom of the
[28:48] wise I'm going to bring to nothing the
[28:49] understanding of The Prudent but yet
[28:51] he's the one that is now saying he's
[28:54] he's drawing even I believe from Hosea
[28:57] that my people are destroyed for the
[28:59] lack of knowledge so Paul's prayer is
[29:01] that you would be filled with all with
[29:03] with the knowledge of his will
[29:07] in all wisdom in spiritual understanding
[29:10] knowledge wisdom spiritual understanding
[29:13] that you might walk worthy of the Lord
[29:17] unto all pleasing being fruitful in
[29:19] every good work and what is this
[29:21] condition and prefaced upon his prayer
[29:23] is that they would be filled with the
[29:25] knowledge of his will and all wisdom and
[29:27] spiritual understanding and that's
[29:28] what's going to give birth to a walk
[29:30] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing
[29:32] being fruitful in every good work and by
[29:34] that increasing in the knowledge of God
[29:38] now that phrase the knowledge of God do
[29:41] not make the mistake of distilling the
[29:43] knowledge of God down to just the black
[29:45] and white of the Bible or doctrinal
[29:48] precepts or historical acknowledgment of
[29:51] things that we attribute to God but
[29:53] recognizing that he is the author of
[29:55] Creation with an intelligence and with
[29:58] the mind that was rooted in a heart
[30:01] purpose
[30:03] there's a I think uh whether it be
[30:06] religion or science or the agnostics or
[30:09] or certain philosophers have tried to
[30:12] turn God into something detached this is
[30:16] just an experiment or it doesn't even
[30:18] exist and one thing that I absolutely
[30:20] love about the message of the hour is it
[30:24] didn't just it's not just um
[30:26] precepts and principles and doctrines
[30:28] that we can just elicit but it was
[30:31] pointing us to a thought a mind a desire
[30:35] a a an Earnest longing to have a
[30:38] fellowship and it brings us all the way
[30:40] back to the back part of God's mind to
[30:42] realize that all of this is intelligence
[30:44] all this is the plan of God for the
[30:46] purpose of redemption and so to be
[30:49] filled with all the knowledge of God and
[30:51] increasing in the knowledge of God means
[30:53] that there's a wisdom and understanding
[30:55] of everything under the sun
[31:00] I was drawn to even the creation story I
[31:03] think I'll come come back to it maybe
[31:05] here soon that in the beginning when God
[31:08] created
[31:09] that God pre-exists this intelligence
[31:13] this desire this thought the this is the
[31:16] creative act of a of a of a higher being
[31:21] and so when you say to be filled with
[31:23] all the knowledge of God
[31:25] that there's not this bifurcation where
[31:27] you have all the things of the world and
[31:29] knowledge and truth and Science and and
[31:33] all these things may be objectively
[31:34] verified and then over here you have God
[31:37] God created everything that exists
[31:41] Ephesians chapter 1 verses 17 and 18.
[31:44] again this is where Paul's prayer comes
[31:47] down that God of our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:49] the father of Glory may give unto you
[31:51] the spirit of wisdom
[31:53] and revelation
[31:54] in the knowledge of him
[31:56] these are not just words there's just
[31:58] there's not really a way that we can
[31:59] just say oh well that's just saying
[32:00] faith faith faith faith but it's
[32:02] something related to Faith
[32:05] something that
[32:07] comes after Faith after you believed
[32:09] after you've been born again now his
[32:10] prayer for the birth is that the spirit
[32:12] of wisdom and Revelation in the
[32:13] knowledge of him would come the eyes of
[32:16] your understanding being enlightened
[32:18] that you might know what is the hope of
[32:20] his calling and the riches of the glory
[32:22] of his inheritance and the Saints has
[32:25] used the language to bring in the spirit
[32:27] of wisdom and Revelation in the
[32:29] knowledge of him it's as if you know if
[32:32] you were a Greek you were a Jew you were
[32:34] a Roman or whatever he's gonna it's
[32:35] scratching your ear right even bringing
[32:37] it to the glory the eyes of your
[32:38] understanding being enlightened
[32:40] that you may know what is the hope of
[32:42] his calling and what the riches of the
[32:44] glory of his inheritance and the Saints
[32:46] that they say that the Romans were all
[32:48] about Glory about Splendor the Greeks
[32:51] were about knowledge and understanding
[32:53] and philosophy the Jews were about light
[32:55] the Lord is a light in Salvation that
[32:57] that's what they were kind of Tethered
[32:58] to and Paul is saying in in all of your
[33:01] little ideologies in your camps there's
[33:03] a truth that can bring you all back to
[33:05] Center and God and unify them if there
[33:08] is a unifying theory that brings all
[33:10] theories together in some sort of
[33:12] wrestling with string theory and what's
[33:14] the what's the one theory that makes
[33:16] sense God is the one truth that brings
[33:19] all truth together and makes sense of it
[33:23] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and
[33:25] the knowledge of him the eyes of your
[33:26] understanding being enlightened this is
[33:28] the prayer for you tonight that your
[33:30] eyes of understanding would be
[33:31] enlightened that you may know what is
[33:33] the hope of his calling and what the
[33:36] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[33:37] in the Saints
[33:40] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 6
[33:42] again this relates to that uh division
[33:45] among Jews and Romans and Greeks to see
[33:47] that it's in Christ that philosophy and
[33:51] truth and experience are all United in
[33:53] one he says for God who commanded the
[33:55] light to shine out of Darkness hath
[33:57] shined in our hearts
[33:58] to give the light of the knowledge of
[34:01] the glory of God
[34:03] in the face of Jesus Christ
[34:05] where is their Glory not in government
[34:07] it's not in Emperors not in armies and
[34:09] not in power but in Christ where is
[34:11] knowledge not in books not in
[34:13] institutions not in academics but in
[34:15] Christ where is light it's not in the
[34:17] flesh it's not in the world it's not in
[34:19] science it's not in semantics it's in
[34:20] the face of Jesus Christ
[34:24] can you see then just through I I have
[34:27] here just five verses
[34:30] that if we're just that
[34:32] I guess we could I guess I realize that
[34:35] it this would be a perfect example of
[34:37] how I've read things that to the the
[34:40] emotional would say yeah that's it
[34:41] that's right wisdom is foolishness
[34:44] and what God has caused wisdom to fail
[34:46] and this and and all that there's a
[34:48] there's a one side people can just take
[34:50] it on the surface take it run with it
[34:52] and then I read these and the other side
[34:54] there could be that academic the
[34:55] intellectual right The Exodus of the
[34:57] scripture and all these things and they
[34:58] take this other side and the homiletics
[35:00] and we're over here and this is it right
[35:03] and and they've run with this and they
[35:04] take these scriptures but I would say
[35:06] neither one of you know what it means
[35:09] right
[35:11] to to to look at these things and take
[35:13] the camps and kind of cherry pick the
[35:16] things that kind of support your
[35:17] position it's what's always doomed
[35:21] one's efforts to know truth is they go
[35:24] to the source to confirm their bias
[35:28] to confirm how they already feel I'm
[35:31] emotional so I want to find confirming
[35:34] evidence in the things of God to confirm
[35:37] my bent to confirm the way I see things
[35:39] and then if you're intellectual or
[35:40] you're this kind of non-emotional uh
[35:43] rigorous cold formal side then you're
[35:45] going to go to the sources in order to
[35:47] find things to confirm how do you
[35:49] already feel instead of going with the
[35:52] heart of faith that knows truth comes
[35:53] from God and I'm going to approach this
[35:55] with the basis of Truth and with the
[35:58] belief that this word is infallible and
[36:00] I'm going to come to it to know truth
[36:02] and that the light of it may shine upon
[36:04] me to either expose what is false or to
[36:08] position what is truth
[36:10] because if to the Romans it was all
[36:12] glory then the face of Jesus Christ
[36:14] takes the True Glory and places it to
[36:16] the Greek who likes to philosophize and
[36:18] have knowledge it could take the truth
[36:20] of knowledge and place it to the Jew who
[36:22] wants Enlightenment science can take the
[36:24] truth and place it
[36:27] and so I'll say it this way instead of
[36:29] separating faith and reason
[36:32] and this is this is where I want you to
[36:34] I don't think it's too late now I'm not
[36:35] going to fall for the trick of looking
[36:37] at the clock
[36:38] I kind of like the fact that this church
[36:39] has no clock
[36:41] the only clock I have is your face right
[36:45] and there's just a way that the hands
[36:46] move sometimes where it's like
[36:50] it's like
[36:53] I'm like well it's approaching nine
[36:55] o'clock
[36:58] so instead of separating faith and
[37:00] reason
[37:03] I I want to be careful how I say this
[37:05] and I want to present it in a way that
[37:06] it's even at the outset you could see
[37:08] where I'm going instead of taking faith
[37:10] and reason and saying you're the bad guy
[37:13] you're the good guy
[37:15] what we ought to do is establish
[37:18] the order of dependence
[37:22] that if Jesus is castigating the Jews
[37:26] for not knowing what the word meant
[37:29] and that they were destroyed for the
[37:31] lack of knowledge and Paul is wanting us
[37:32] to be filled with the knowledge of his
[37:33] will with wisdom and spiritual
[37:34] understanding increasing in the
[37:36] knowledge of God with the spirit of
[37:37] wisdom and the Revelation in the
[37:38] knowledge of him the eyes of your
[37:39] understanding Enlightenment may know
[37:40] what the hope of this calling the riches
[37:42] of his glory and to give the light of
[37:43] the knowledge of the glory of God that
[37:44] maybe there's something more to what we
[37:47] say faith is and maybe more to what is
[37:50] reason and wisdom and knowledge and
[37:51] understanding than what we say it is and
[37:54] recognize the order of dependence or the
[37:57] relationship among them
[37:59] we know that faith is a gift of God
[38:03] we know that God is only known by faith
[38:06] that you do not know God by science you
[38:08] do not know God by by having a
[38:11] hypothesis that then becomes a theory
[38:13] that then can become a fact that is not
[38:15] how you know God through a scientific
[38:16] method you can truly only know God as
[38:19] he's revealed to you in the truth of
[38:21] things
[38:23] so then we we recognize them that faith
[38:26] is to God
[38:27] this faith when we talk about faith
[38:29] we're talking about faith to God now
[38:31] there's a faith that we could have
[38:32] intellectually
[38:34] that we could it's our own faith that we
[38:36] we can put towards anything even in one
[38:39] another
[38:40] but there is a Divine Faith even
[38:43] I I didn't have time to get to it before
[38:45] but there's a Ophelia love and agape
[38:47] love
[38:48] and philio love produces a trust or
[38:50] dependence what is it that's human
[38:53] towards what if I love you I love my
[38:54] wife in a filial sense there's a trust
[38:56] and a confidence there but then when
[38:57] it's the love of God an agape love and
[38:59] there's a love of God then there's a
[39:01] faith and trust in another level that's
[39:02] a different kind of Faith with a
[39:04] different kind of love and those are the
[39:06] kind of the
[39:07] um another example of how you can have
[39:09] human Faith or Divine faith so there is
[39:12] a Divine Faith which is of god it is
[39:14] that Faith which we know God not by
[39:16] science
[39:17] so now with that established that that's
[39:19] where the faith is that we're talking
[39:21] about
[39:22] God does not depend upon Humanity or
[39:27] Reason
[39:29] he's just he's not dependent upon it
[39:31] he's not that is not what we rely upon
[39:35] to know him we know God by faith and God
[39:37] does not rely upon Humanity or reasoning
[39:40] but humanity and reason depend upon God
[39:45] so when we've placed God as the absolute
[39:47] or the ultimate as the supreme authority
[39:49] is the highest intelligence and if we
[39:51] look at it that way not that we are we
[39:54] are the brains of this outfit like what
[39:57] are we going to do tonight brain well
[39:58] we're going to figure out whether or not
[39:59] God exists right
[40:01] and and that's how we look at things
[40:04] that we're the we're the Smart Guys in
[40:06] the room and we're going to try to
[40:07] figure out God no we recognize there is
[40:10] a God he's the higher intelligence he's
[40:12] the greatest and that's what we believe
[40:13] by faith so then now God is Not
[40:16] depending upon our Humanity or our
[40:18] reason but our reasoning and our
[40:20] Humanity or our reason is entirely
[40:23] dependent upon him
[40:26] therefore this is the real key here and
[40:29] I even wrote this down so I wouldn't
[40:30] miss it rationality and reason then
[40:34] are part of our relationship with God
[40:39] we use rationality reason wisdom
[40:42] understanding knowledge those things are
[40:46] all part of our relationship with God
[40:49] and they cannot this is the problem they
[40:53] cannot become independent
[40:57] however you want to draw it up in your
[40:58] notebooks and show me later and say if
[41:00] you just would have drawn it out this
[41:01] way it all made sense
[41:02] but you have knowledge and wisdom and
[41:05] understanding and reason and rationality
[41:08] and thought all these things and as long
[41:12] as they are
[41:14] a part of your relationship to God
[41:17] then God can place those things or they
[41:21] can they can operate in their proper
[41:22] context but as soon as you make them
[41:25] independent that's where they begin to
[41:27] fail
[41:28] so if you divide faith and reason and it
[41:31] started is said instead of establishing
[41:34] the proper order of dependence that you
[41:36] have faith that is to God in faith that
[41:38] is from God and that reason is in
[41:41] relationship to it and dependent upon it
[41:43] as soon as you separate them you'll
[41:45] either abandon reason or demand that God
[41:48] comply with yours
[41:52] you've abandoned it like I don't need
[41:54] reason at all or you you make God meet
[41:58] or comply or abide by your wisdom
[42:04] strip reason from our faith I know I'm
[42:06] making some statements tonight but maybe
[42:08] I'll let you cause you to come back for
[42:10] part seven
[42:11] you strip reason from our faith and
[42:13] we're left emphasizing what feeling
[42:15] experience
[42:17] we had a phrase one time I was like
[42:19] that's it lazy Dogma
[42:22] it's exactly what it becomes when we
[42:24] strip knowledge wisdom understanding
[42:27] reason it's no longer part of our
[42:29] relationship with God and what we've
[42:31] done is we've thrown away as the side as
[42:34] the enemy to our faith I know these are
[42:36] difficult things I hope you're
[42:37] understanding where I'm bringing this
[42:38] from that if we've taken all these
[42:41] things that Paul talked about and we've
[42:43] made them bad on their face and once
[42:46] we've stripped that from our faith then
[42:47] it just becomes lazy Dogma because you
[42:49] just tell people what to do or don't you
[42:51] question it
[42:53] I'm your pastor you do what I say you
[42:56] write me a check for twenty thousand
[42:57] dollars tonight
[42:59] right that it gets that way
[43:02] you know you're not gonna go to Heaven
[43:03] until we build a church that has a gold
[43:04] pulpit and things like that and don't
[43:07] question it
[43:08] and there's no search in the scriptures
[43:13] there's no employing the heart of God or
[43:15] looking into the things of God in the
[43:17] mind of God to know what where where's
[43:19] the what what upholds this
[43:21] and so you could take this
[43:24] the I'm using the term reason but I hope
[43:26] it's pointing to more than just that
[43:28] worldly reason you take it out of it
[43:30] then all you have is experience all you
[43:32] have is feeling and everything you
[43:34] believe is just lazy Dogma
[43:38] yet
[43:40] on the other hand if we make our faith
[43:42] subject to reason
[43:44] or unrelated
[43:47] so there's this
[43:49] you you take
[43:52] well you make it in the sense that
[43:55] I am going to arrive at truth through
[43:57] rational thought
[43:58] and through human discipline and effort
[44:00] to figure things out then you make faith
[44:03] in it's now subject to reason it's
[44:05] dependent upon reason and then you just
[44:07] you gravitate to skepticism
[44:10] you become you be you lose your morality
[44:15] because the more that you're looking to
[44:16] things from that academic standpoint and
[44:19] through just that method alone there's
[44:21] no absolute truth that upholds it it's
[44:24] just human inspiration uh from a
[44:27] scientific standpoint and what's best
[44:30] and what's right and what's ethical and
[44:32] it's not coming back to what are the
[44:33] principles of God what is the nature of
[44:35] God how does God judge things because
[44:37] listen we've recognized it that God's
[44:39] equity and fairness does not operate by
[44:42] human laws and instincts of equity and
[44:45] fairness
[44:46] say it a lot and I'll say it over and
[44:48] over and over again whatever God says is
[44:50] true whatever God does is just
[44:53] and that's it
[44:55] when he speaks it's the truth when he
[44:57] acts it's right
[45:00] and if you then make the things of God
[45:03] kind of the product of our reasoning
[45:05] then we delve into skepticism and it
[45:08] results in immorality
[45:12] and I'll say this
[45:15] it isn't necessary to create create a
[45:17] rivalry
[45:18] between faith and reason
[45:21] it's necessary to put them in order
[45:24] it's necessary
[45:25] stand the hierarchy
[45:29] ours not Paul's called speaking to us
[45:31] and saying hey I know you've never
[45:32] really heard of these things before but
[45:33] get knowledge and get wisdom and get
[45:35] understanding but there's those who have
[45:36] been enlightened through that ecstasy
[45:38] through that birth through that Soul
[45:40] realm to have this other sense that that
[45:42] now want it needs to awaken inside of us
[45:45] this mind of Christ
[45:48] which is the mind of the Divine
[45:51] who is the creator of the Earth
[45:54] and the one that is set in motion all
[45:56] laws and all principles
[45:58] when you look at and I may be getting a
[46:00] little bit uh on Shaky Ground here
[46:02] because I don't have any of these things
[46:03] in front of me
[46:04] but some of the most renowned scientists
[46:08] in human history
[46:10] and and through the the real
[46:12] Enlightenment period And when there was
[46:14] great advances in the establishment of
[46:16] great truth those men were Christians
[46:20] and and their discipline and their
[46:23] efforts and their desire to achieve
[46:25] things weren't this
[46:27] uh conspiratorial effort to undermine
[46:30] the truths of God but it was this this
[46:32] understanding that God's the one that
[46:34] formed these things and that the more
[46:36] that we can learn about the Earth the
[46:37] more we're learning about God the more
[46:39] that we can learn about the planets the
[46:40] more great God seems and and that the
[46:43] more knowledge of creation is the
[46:44] knowledge of the Creator in a sense
[46:46] because we are taught in the Bible that
[46:48] the visible invisible things of God are
[46:50] declared To Us by the visible creation
[46:52] and so there was tremendous scientists
[46:54] who founded a lot of the basic
[46:56] principles that uphold science today and
[46:58] they were God-fearing bible-believing
[47:00] Christians am I right anybody who reads
[47:03] Wikipedia can you tell me whether or not
[47:04] I'm right
[47:05] it's true
[47:07] a lot of the mathematicians and the
[47:09] scientists
[47:10] philosophers were Christians
[47:13] they believed in the Bible they believed
[47:15] in the things of God
[47:17] but look how far man has gone with
[47:20] science once they turned away their
[47:23] faith in God
[47:25] and put it in themselves
[47:28] that's how we went from a horse and
[47:29] buggy to a rocket ship
[47:31] because man took the faith he had in God
[47:34] and they took it and they separated
[47:38] faith and reason the faith of God and
[47:41] they took their own faith and put it in
[47:42] their reason and yeah man has been able
[47:44] to do a lot
[47:45] with his faith and his own ability been
[47:48] able to go from horsepower to Rocket
[47:50] Power and put a man on the moon in a
[47:52] short period of time just a few decades
[47:54] able to accomplish that because he let
[47:56] loose of his faith in God and gave
[47:58] himself over reasonings and such right
[48:01] and so he's able to accomplish a lot but
[48:03] what has it delve into nothing is
[48:04] certain
[48:05] everything's always changing uh I I mean
[48:09] you just think about the rhythm of what
[48:10] you ought to eat and what you ought not
[48:13] to eat right
[48:14] MSG is going to come back in style here
[48:16] pretty soon right you know we're
[48:18] realizing all along that processed
[48:20] flowers were the Bedrock to a healthy
[48:22] lifestyle please right it's like this is
[48:27] just how it goes because science is ever
[48:29] learning they let loose of their faith
[48:31] in God
[48:32] and now what we've achieved is a great
[48:34] scientific knowledgeable community and
[48:37] we have tremendous advancements but
[48:39] anymore it's less moral than it's ever
[48:41] been and it's constantly wrestling with
[48:43] the morality and the ethics of its
[48:45] developments and they have no they have
[48:47] no Bedrock by which to judge what is
[48:49] right and what's moral and so it's just
[48:52] given itself over to immorality in the
[48:55] very disciplines that ought to be the
[48:57] most knowledgeable the most
[48:58] understanding in the most precise and
[49:01] the ones that rely upon science now have
[49:03] given themselves over to Absolute
[49:06] insanity
[49:09] because they want to be sensitive
[49:12] they don't want to offend
[49:14] because they've left they've left
[49:16] they've separated faith and reason
[49:19] and I would say
[49:22] that
[49:24] I hope that that I hope that makes
[49:26] um
[49:28] I hope you can see the connection
[49:31] that there's a way that man just merely
[49:33] operates in his head
[49:36] and it's no longer Guided by those
[49:38] principles that ought to be of the heart
[49:42] of righteousness and justice
[49:44] a true wisdom and knowledge
[49:49] and when it comes to you as a person
[49:55] that separation
[49:57] of the faith in your soul
[50:00] from the condition of your spirit and
[50:01] your body
[50:03] can create a disharmony
[50:06] that will plague your development
[50:09] because you're almost living you become
[50:12] bipolar
[50:14] you have what you have in your soul and
[50:16] then kind of the rest of it is like this
[50:17] enemy
[50:19] instead of realizing that they're
[50:21] they're that the the desire that Paul is
[50:23] speaking of is a Harmony among Body
[50:25] Spirit and soul
[50:27] that your body which feels and your
[50:29] spirit which reasons would be in harmony
[50:31] with your soul which has faith
[50:34] that the soul with its Faith then comes
[50:36] into and takes spirit and body and says
[50:40] this is this is the way walk ye in it
[50:45] I know these are familiar scriptures to
[50:47] you
[50:48] now just
[50:50] I'll end on these maybe I had a
[50:52] statement to read I'll maybe hold off on
[50:53] it
[50:54] but he says in Proverbs Chapter 2 Verse
[50:56] 6 for the lord giveth wisdom
[50:59] and out of his mouth cometh knowledge
[51:00] and understanding
[51:02] so the Lord gives wisdom
[51:05] and out of his mouth cometh knowledge
[51:06] and understanding
[51:08] and these are principles
[51:10] these are truths
[51:12] for life
[51:15] they're not just principles and truths
[51:17] that that make for a good church service
[51:19] or or are that are the fodder for church
[51:23] bulletin boards it is a knowledge and a
[51:25] wisdom which pertains to All Things the
[51:28] Lord gives wisdom out of his mouth mouth
[51:30] cometh knowledge and understanding again
[51:32] in Proverbs chapter 9 verses 9 and 10 it
[51:34] says give instruction to a wise man and
[51:36] he will be yet wiser
[51:38] teach a just man and he will increase in
[51:40] learning this is not said in a way to
[51:43] mock deride or devalue wisdom and
[51:47] teaching but it's saying that this
[51:49] principle of instruction and teaching
[51:52] increases the right kind of wisdom and
[51:54] knowledge
[51:56] that's what we ought to get right with
[51:58] all that getting get understanding
[52:00] verse 10 the fear of the Lord is the
[52:01] beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of
[52:03] the Holy is understanding this was the
[52:06] secret to the success of the early
[52:07] scientist is they feared God
[52:10] that's the beginning of wisdom and the
[52:12] knowledge of the holiest understanding
[52:13] that if we are able to attain to facts
[52:16] but yet it's separated from truth what
[52:18] does it get us in the end
[52:21] if there's facts that point to a truth
[52:23] we remind ourselves again that all truth
[52:26] is God's truth
[52:27] doesn't matter what it is if it's truth
[52:29] it's God's truth and the fear of the
[52:31] Lord is the beginning of wisdom so true
[52:33] understanding or true wisdom is found in
[52:36] the fear of God outside of this all
[52:38] there can be is worldly wisdom which
[52:40] will fail but if I fear the lord then I
[52:42] can Avail myself and ask and God will
[52:45] not upgrade me saying God give me more
[52:47] wisdom give me more discernment
[52:50] and it's the knowledge of the Holy the
[52:52] knowledge of the things of God that is
[52:53] understanding
[52:55] I don't have maybe the
[52:57] I I I just what what wells up inside of
[53:02] me
[53:03] I I just don't feel that I can
[53:05] articulate it
[53:07] but if we as Christians could labor to
[53:12] have the mind of Christ to see things
[53:14] the way he sees things to have his
[53:17] nature and his sensitivity to have the
[53:20] spirit of the word and not just the
[53:22] letter of it what it gives you puts you
[53:24] in the position of true wisdom
[53:27] true understanding and knowledge Kurt
[53:29] you don't need to argue the political
[53:32] points of the day you don't need to find
[53:35] yourself in the extremes and the
[53:37] platitudes and the platforms that have
[53:38] caused all all the partisanship that
[53:41] exist within society today you could
[53:43] have the wisdom that actually takes the
[53:45] truth of the polars and can bring people
[53:48] to the reality of a living God who has
[53:51] designed nature who is set in motioned
[53:54] these things and satisfy the hunger of
[53:57] all those seeking people that have found
[53:59] themselves in the ideologies and the
[54:01] extremes to status to to to placate the
[54:04] fear that they have
[54:06] you have the answer to it
[54:09] the knowledge of the Holy is
[54:10] understanding
[54:19] we're going to stop there
[54:22] let's stand
