[0:00] uh this um
[0:01] thought that we just want to use a man
[0:05] tonight the attribute of Salvation we
[0:07] will just kind of use a number of
[0:09] scriptures to kind of prove our thought
[0:11] but let me start with a couple quotes
[0:14] here that brother Branham amen gives us
[0:17] when and one we why are we not a
[0:19] denomination it says uh which was first
[0:22] a savior or a sinner
[0:26] says which was first a savior which was
[0:29] first A Healer or a sick person it says
[0:32] why was there permitted to be a scare if
[0:35] there never been a sinner he'd never
[0:39] been known as a savior
[0:42] says hallelujah he can make all things
[0:44] wind around to his glory can the Potter
[0:47] say or the pot say to the Potter you
[0:49] made me thus who's on the wheel who's
[0:52] got the claim whose hands is it in Paul
[0:55] said a foolish man didn't he say he
[0:58] raised Pharaoh up for the very purpose
[1:00] certainly he knew it before there was a
[1:03] world he knowed who would be what and he
[1:07] let there be sin that he might be a
[1:11] savior he let there be sickness that he
[1:14] might be a Healer he let there be hate
[1:17] that he might be love sure he did he's
[1:22] God and that's his attributes and he has
[1:25] to have something to display his
[1:27] attributes how would you ever know there
[1:30] was a night how would you uh no ever
[1:33] know there's any if if it was all
[1:35] daylight how would you ever know there
[1:37] was a night there's a night so it could
[1:39] prove daylight sure there is amen you
[1:42] see what he did so you know the prophet
[1:44] just makes it very clear here uh before
[1:47] there was a sinner there had to be a
[1:49] savior amen and and and the other thing
[1:52] here is that uh uh in order for him to
[1:55] display this attribute of Salvation amen
[1:58] somebody had to be lost glory to God uh
[2:01] all of us can say that we were in that
[2:03] place where we were lost at one time but
[2:05] that attribute was expressed to us
[2:07] that's why we're here tonight amen the
[2:10] attribute of Salvation is why we're here
[2:12] tonight now I want to just kind of
[2:14] mention something here because uh I'm
[2:16] gonna show you just in Scripture that
[2:19] all through the Old Testament this
[2:22] attribute of Salvation was actually
[2:24] being demonstrated amen and sometimes
[2:27] you may not realize it but even in your
[2:29] own life this attribute is expressed
[2:32] hallelujah amen and I there's a little
[2:35] thought that I remember the prophet
[2:36] saying all that God was amen he poured
[2:41] into Christ and all that Christ is every
[2:46] attribute that is in Christ he is
[2:48] pouring that into his church Hallelujah
[2:51] I wrote this if a lion gives birth then
[2:54] you expect another lion to be born amen
[2:58] if a zebra gives birth then you expect
[3:01] another zebra to be born amen if a dog
[3:04] gives birth then you expect another dog
[3:06] to be born praise God if a human gives
[3:10] birth then you expect another human to
[3:12] be born but if God gives birth glory to
[3:15] God we expect another God to be born
[3:18] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[3:21] amen amen here the prophet says God gave
[3:24] Jesus his Spirit without measure in him
[3:27] dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily
[3:30] he was God manifested In the Flesh the
[3:32] Bible said that God was in Christ
[3:35] reconciling the world to himself but
[3:38] when he gave out his Spirit to we
[3:40] adopted Sons he gave us a bucket full
[3:44] out of the ocean and he had all the
[3:46] fullness of the godhead we just have a
[3:48] portion of it as a gift of the Holy
[3:51] Spirit but I I but if I took one bucket
[3:54] full of water out of the ocean or even a
[3:57] tea a teaspoon full of it out of the
[3:59] ocean the same chemicals that's in the
[4:02] entire ocean would be in that Spoonful
[4:05] but just less in quantity not less in
[4:08] quality amen but less in quantity so the
[4:12] same holy spirit that was in Christ
[4:15] Grace is also in his church
[4:19] every attribute that was in God
[4:22] amen it was poured into Christ in every
[4:25] attribute that was in Christ is being
[4:27] poured into the church
[4:29] hallelujah amen I love uh this scripture
[4:33] that we read in Luke 2 verse 11 it says
[4:36] For unto us unto you is Born This Day in
[4:38] the city of David a savior amen which is
[4:41] Christ the lord and when we just look at
[4:44] the definition of that word savior it is
[4:47] a preserver
[4:48] a Defender a man or deliverer amen
[4:53] savior could be a man a preserver a
[4:56] defender or a deliverer amen amen let's
[5:02] go a little further uh with our our
[5:04] topic tonight just keep that in mind a
[5:07] savior could be a preserver a defender
[5:09] or deliverer here in that mess in the
[5:13] message that day on Calvary brother
[5:15] random makes a statement here he says
[5:16] and When sin struck the Earth back in
[5:19] the beginning like a sheet of Blackness
[5:22] falling from the heaven it literally
[5:24] paralyzed the Earth it thrown every
[5:27] creature on the earth and all of God's
[5:29] creation in bondage man was under
[5:33] bondage of death sickness troubles
[5:36] Sorrows all nature fell with it sin was
[5:41] an anesthetic that actually paralyzed
[5:43] the Earth and then we sat here hopeless
[5:47] amen because every creature on Earth was
[5:49] subject to it and everyone born on Earth
[5:51] was subject to it so it had to come from
[5:54] some place
[5:56] where there was no sin amen it could not
[5:59] come from the earth and I love that
[6:01] statement amen the the remedy had to
[6:03] come from some place where there was no
[6:06] sin I want to tell you that you have
[6:08] come from a place where there was no sin
[6:11] you have come from a place where there
[6:13] was no sickness you have come from a
[6:16] place where there were no hospitals you
[6:18] have come from a place where there were
[6:19] no graveyards amen you have come from a
[6:22] place where there was no sin and that's
[6:25] why we longed to go back to that place
[6:27] that we've come from Hallelujah we know
[6:29] it exists because we came from there
[6:32] blessed be the name of the Lord amen it
[6:34] says one of us could not redeem the
[6:37] other it had to come from another
[6:40] therefore when man realized that he was
[6:43] separated from from his God he become a
[6:46] Wanderer they wept they cried they toil
[6:48] they wandered about through the
[6:50] mountains and through the desert seeking
[6:52] a city whose Builder and maker was God
[6:54] for he knew that if he ever got back in
[6:57] the presence of God he could talk it
[6:59] over with him but there was no way back
[7:02] he become lost he didn't know which way
[7:05] to turn so he just took out wandering
[7:07] trying to find somewhere that he could
[7:09] find a way back to that place something
[7:11] on the inside of him told him that he'd
[7:14] come from a place that was perfect
[7:16] amen you know and we realized this was
[7:19] the very reason because of what happened
[7:21] in the Garden of Eating the sin that
[7:23] struck amen it paralyzed us amen but the
[7:26] but but the very reason of us needing
[7:28] Christ is because he was the way back to
[7:32] that place where there's no more sin
[7:34] that place where there is no sickness he
[7:36] was the way back we have to go through
[7:38] Christ to get back into that place
[7:41] we thank God for the Savior that was
[7:43] born brother Branham made this statement
[7:45] uh a man could not save himself so
[7:48] therefore we needed a savior man could
[7:52] not redeem himself therefore we needed a
[7:55] redeemer and and I want to put this God
[7:58] begin to tell the story of Salvation and
[8:01] Redemption through various characters in
[8:04] the scripture now let's just pick up a
[8:07] man this first character Joshua a man in
[8:10] Joshua 10 and 6 will see amen uh just
[8:14] something that happened here and and
[8:15] Joshua's uh a life now I will just take
[8:20] a quick um just to just kind of a quick
[8:23] quick recap of his story Joshua was
[8:26] there uh
[8:28] um the the father he he followed Moses
[8:30] Ministry but then he got raised up Amen
[8:33] to be the next leader and it was
[8:34] established that he would be the leader
[8:36] I thank God for that I love that I love
[8:39] when Ministries a man can uh have good
[8:43] succession plans
[8:45] I like that and and unfortunately I
[8:48] think there's a lot of Ministries that
[8:50] miss this but uh but Joshua's
[8:52] established as the leader before Moses
[8:55] went off to sing that way it didn't
[8:57] leave any confusion and even the people
[8:59] said you know what we'll stand behind
[9:01] you Joshua if we see the same God moving
[9:03] in your ministry that was moving in in
[9:05] Moses ministry will stand right behind
[9:07] you they would support him so we thank
[9:08] God for that but but Joshua amen had a a
[9:11] great responsibility not only lead the
[9:13] people of brother but brother brother
[9:14] random said he had to divide the land
[9:16] accordingly amen and uh and Joshua's
[9:19] there dividing the land and and God had
[9:21] told them to not make any agreements
[9:24] with any of the people in the land well
[9:25] Joshua got ahead of himself and he let
[9:28] some people trick him into an agreement
[9:30] the gibeonax I believe it was they
[9:32] tricked him into an agreement well while
[9:34] uh while when they signed the agreement
[9:36] Joshua provided them protection and here
[9:39] in this scripture we'll see that they
[9:41] are they had some some other enemies
[9:43] coming against them and what they did
[9:45] did is they reached out to Joshua a man
[9:49] for there to be their deliverer they
[9:51] reached out to Joshua amen and they
[9:54] asked him to be their Savior and Joshua
[9:57] actually means Jehovah Savior and here
[10:01] in Joshua 10 66 and the men of gibeon
[10:03] sent unto Joshua to the camp to gilgolf
[10:07] saying slap not thy hand from thy
[10:10] servants come up to us quickly and look
[10:13] at that and save us so they're asking
[10:17] Joshua to be their Savior and his name
[10:21] actually means Jehovah savior amen and
[10:25] save us and help us for all the kings of
[10:28] the amorites that dwell in the mountains
[10:30] that gather together against us now amen
[10:32] I don't want to just leave that there
[10:34] for Joshua you know even in your own
[10:36] personal life when certain family
[10:38] members are or friends or even
[10:40] co-workers get into certain situations
[10:42] maybe at times am I they might look at
[10:45] you as the Holy Roller amen and other
[10:47] times they look at you as the you know
[10:49] the the you know the Christian amen
[10:52] amongst everybody amen you're the light
[10:54] in the midst of the darkness but when
[10:55] they get into trouble they know exactly
[10:57] who to call
[10:59] right Hallelujah I want you to notice
[11:01] they don't even call amen they don't go
[11:04] to God themselves but the way that they
[11:06] reach God is through you because the
[11:08] attribute is flowing through you
[11:12] oh blessed be the name of the Lord this
[11:15] is exactly what the gibeonax did amen
[11:18] they approached Joshua and said please
[11:20] save us here's this attribute being
[11:22] expressed through the ministry of Joshua
[11:26] let's go on a little further brother
[11:27] Brandon makes a statement Amen in this
[11:30] message the way of a true prophet of God
[11:33] it says and then I get I gave the
[11:35] illustration of how the Israel and the
[11:37] march to the promised land they had
[11:39] never seen that land they know nothing
[11:41] about it they just had a promise of of
[11:44] God there was a land and it was full of
[11:46] milk and honey and good and a great
[11:47] place they never had seen it nobody had
[11:50] ever been there or know anything about
[11:53] it but they had a problem they had the
[11:54] promise of it and by faith they so
[11:57] jormed through the desert and when they
[11:59] got right to the borderline they had a
[12:01] warrior there by the name of Joshua
[12:03] which means Jehovah's savior so he
[12:06] crossed over to Jordan into the promised
[12:08] land and brought back the evidence that
[12:10] the land was there I like that and it
[12:13] was a good Land Two Men packed one bunch
[12:15] of grapes it was a good land so he
[12:17] brought back the evidence that the land
[12:19] that they were going to possess was
[12:21] there now to the church we are
[12:23] journeying to a land of immortality a
[12:26] land where there's no death amen a land
[12:28] where the dance raised up we had we had
[12:31] a great Savior and I can't Jesus means
[12:34] Jehovah savior beloved and he crossed
[12:37] the Jordan of death over into the other
[12:39] land and come back and brought the
[12:40] evidence that we live after death amen
[12:43] so where is death at
[12:45] I love I love the way the prophet put
[12:48] that he says this Joshua uh which meant
[12:51] Jehovah uh savior amen was the perfect
[12:56] type of Christ he crossed Jordan and
[12:59] brought brought back a good report that
[13:01] the land was flowing with milk and honey
[13:03] amen Jordan also represents a spiritual
[13:06] death
[13:07] Jesus went across Jordan which he he
[13:10] went across death amen and rose again
[13:13] after the third day and he proved that
[13:14] the lamb was good on the other side of
[13:16] death
[13:18] Jesus proved that the land was good on
[13:21] the other side of death for the believer
[13:23] it's an eternal land where we never get
[13:26] sick and we never have to die again amen
[13:29] it is a land flown with milk and honey
[13:31] praise God we thank God for proof we
[13:34] have nothing to worry about
[13:36] blessed be the name of the Lord this
[13:39] story of redemption
[13:41] continues to be uh told or the story of
[13:45] Salvation Redemption it continued to be
[13:46] told through various characters in
[13:49] Scripture now you know when I was uh
[13:52] reading this scripture out of Nehemiah 9
[13:54] I want to read that Nehemiah 9 and verse
[13:57] 24.
[13:58] I read this in my my Bible reading and
[14:01] and my
[14:02] it just it just blessed me it actually
[14:05] it it's the one that inspired me to
[14:07] preach this sermon
[14:10] look at what the Bible says in Nehemiah
[14:12] 9 verse 24-27 says so the children went
[14:15] in
[14:16] and possessed the land
[14:18] and thou subdue us before them the
[14:20] inhabitants of the land the Canaanites
[14:22] and gave us them into their hands with
[14:24] their kings and the people of the land
[14:27] that they might do with them as they
[14:28] would
[14:29] and they took strong cities and a fat
[14:33] land and possessed Houses full of goods
[14:35] Wells digged Vineyards and Olive yards
[14:38] and fruit trees in abundance so they did
[14:41] eat and were filled and became fat and
[14:43] delighted themselves in thy great
[14:45] goodness nevertheless they were
[14:48] disobedient and rebelled against thee
[14:50] and cast thy law behind their backs and
[14:53] slew thy prophets which testified
[14:55] against them to turn them to thee and
[14:58] they wrought great provocations in verse
[15:01] 27 I like this therefore thou deliverest
[15:03] them into the hand of their enemies who
[15:06] vexed them and and and uh
[15:09] and uh in the time of their trouble when
[15:12] they Cried unto thee thou heard a stem
[15:15] from heaven and according to thy
[15:17] manifold mercies thou gavest them
[15:20] saviors
[15:23] now who saved them out of their out of
[15:26] the hand of their enemies and I just
[15:28] like the way that that reads it says you
[15:31] gave them he gave them saviors not just
[15:34] one
[15:35] right we know Christ is the ultimate
[15:37] savior but this attribute is being
[15:40] expressed
[15:42] amen through different characters of the
[15:44] scripture and he even said it in
[15:45] Nehemiah he gave them saviors this is a
[15:50] title that he gave them oh my my my my
[15:53] right so so again now when we look at uh
[15:56] just that word I went to the Hebrew
[15:58] lexicon where it says Thou gave us some
[16:00] saviors I just looked at that and it's
[16:03] the word uh Yasha uh uh but it's it
[16:07] means to be saved to be delivered to be
[16:10] liberated a man to be victorious right
[16:14] to save from moral troubles to give
[16:17] Victory to and there's a number of
[16:19] scriptures that that it refers to in the
[16:21] Greek Lexicon I just wanted to pick up a
[16:23] couple of them and share them with you
[16:25] glory to God one of them is Exodus 2
[16:28] verse 17. amen and what is going on here
[16:32] in Exodus 2 is is Moses
[16:36] um amen is is driven out glory to God
[16:39] and and uh and and here he comes I
[16:42] believe there was a time here where he
[16:43] comes and he's helping somebody uh water
[16:46] that their their um their their flock
[16:48] right and when he comes in to help this
[16:51] word help is actually he came in to be a
[16:53] savior glory to God you all remember
[16:55] amen there I think it was Jethro's
[16:57] daughters they were going through all
[16:58] kind of things with the with the other
[17:00] Shepherds and Moses stood up for on
[17:02] their behalf he became a savior oh my
[17:05] amen when he stood up on their behalf
[17:07] that attribute was actually expressed
[17:09] through Moses
[17:11] oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[17:14] all that God was he poured into Christ
[17:16] and all that Christ is he is pouring
[17:19] that into the church
[17:21] these attributes are now being expressed
[17:23] to us here in Exodus 2 17 the Shepherds
[17:26] came and drove them away but Moses stood
[17:29] up and helped them amen and watered
[17:33] their flocks so when he when he when he
[17:35] helped him he actually became the
[17:37] deliverer amen he actually became the
[17:39] Savior and he might not have realized
[17:42] but this attribute of Deliverance was
[17:43] going to flow all the way back down into
[17:45] Egypt because one day he was going to
[17:48] get a call on the backside of the desert
[17:50] that he had to return to Egypt and guess
[17:52] what he would have to be a savior to his
[17:55] people amen there in Egypt oh blessed be
[17:58] the name of the Lord also Exodus 14.
[18:02] amen verse 30.
[18:05] it says this thus the Lord saved Israel
[18:09] that day out of the hand of the
[18:10] Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians
[18:13] dead upon the Seesaw so when God
[18:15] delivereth them amen and they saw the
[18:17] Egyptians drowning there in in the Red
[18:20] Sea they realized that God had become a
[18:24] savior to them this attribute of
[18:26] Salvation was being manifested blessed
[18:30] be the name of the Lord here's a another
[18:32] one a man that we can pick up actually
[18:36] I'm I'm I'm going to
[18:40] I'm going to move just to another quote
[18:42] here
[18:43] brother Brandon makes this statement
[18:46] out of the message the faith of Abraham
[18:49] it says
[18:50] when you're saved
[18:52] God gives you a checkbook
[18:55] at the bottom of it it's got Jesus name
[18:57] sign on every check
[18:59] any Redemptive blessing belongs to you
[19:03] are you afraid to fill it out and
[19:05] Abraham's children are you afraid he
[19:08] won't recognize the name of Jesus
[19:10] whatever you ask the father in my name
[19:13] that I will do that's the promise you're
[19:16] Abraham's children you're not afraid to
[19:19] fill it out the right hand the right
[19:21] hand of God making intercessions for
[19:23] that's what he died for and it goes on
[19:27] says now Abraham sure he was Heir then
[19:30] after a while a lot got in trouble now
[19:32] we'll close an amendment and in a minute
[19:34] lot got in trouble and you always get in
[19:37] trouble when you backslot all right we
[19:40] wish we have time to dwell on that but
[19:42] he got in trouble what happened the
[19:44] enemy come and packed him off now
[19:46] brother Brandon makes a statement it is
[19:48] now Abraham played the part of the
[19:52] Savior again
[19:54] when light got in trouble the prophet
[19:57] says Abraham so this attribute was being
[20:01] expressed through Abraham when Abraham
[20:04] went out at the lot he had nothing to go
[20:07] with he had no Army to go with amen he
[20:09] had he had just a few tools in the shed
[20:12] that he could use Amen to go after five
[20:14] Kings my God but see it didn't matter
[20:17] because God was with him as he was going
[20:19] after those kings and brother Branham
[20:21] say Abraham Hallelujah played the part
[20:25] of the Savior again and I want to say
[20:27] this as Abraham is playing the part of a
[20:30] savior amen if ever that attribute has
[20:32] been expressed a savior has to be
[20:34] willing to give his life
[20:37] a savior has to be willing to die for
[20:39] the other person that they're saying uh
[20:41] you just can't be a hero just to be a
[20:43] hero you got to be willing to go through
[20:45] something to be a hero
[20:48] Hallelujah
[20:49] Gloria he says Abraham played the part
[20:52] of the Savior again he gassed himself
[20:55] and went after the enemy that took away
[20:57] his poor backslidden corrupted brother
[20:59] that's what Jesus did sickness bound you
[21:04] sin bound you poor backslip and
[21:06] corrupted and Jesus came in and went
[21:09] after you and he brought lot back
[21:11] Abraham did not only did he bring a lot
[21:14] back but Christ brought us back he was
[21:16] willing to go after us but this
[21:18] attribute has been expressed through
[21:20] these various characters remember he
[21:22] gave unto them Israel he gave them to
[21:24] them saviors
[21:27] saviors
[21:29] brother Branham just clearly told us
[21:31] that Abraham was a was what played the
[21:33] part of Savior
[21:35] and and here I like this lot was
[21:37] overtaken and captured and if lot could
[21:41] have saved himself he would have
[21:45] see a savior the reason that um lot
[21:48] needed a savings because he was so bound
[21:50] and amen he was he was he was captured
[21:53] there was nothing he could do for
[21:54] himself he had to realize he needed a
[21:57] savior
[21:58] and we're the same way amen sin has kept
[22:02] us in bondage and and sickness and all
[22:04] this we needed a savior
[22:08] glory to God Amen I said I wrote this
[22:11] note had he been strong enough or the
[22:14] city that he was in had they been strong
[22:16] enough they would have defeated the
[22:18] opposing armies themselves but lot
[22:21] needed someone greater than him to bring
[22:24] deliverance and we need someone greater
[22:27] than us to bring Deliverance
[22:30] hallelujah amen he had a relative I love
[22:33] this he had a relative that was willing
[22:35] to do whatever it took to bring
[22:38] Salvation
[22:40] Abraham would not leave his backslidden
[22:42] brother in that condition I'll do
[22:43] whatever I got to do to go get my
[22:45] brother out of that
[22:47] brother Branham say Abraham played the
[22:50] part of Savior Jesus left his throne in
[22:53] glory
[22:55] to come and bring the Redemption story
[22:57] to us whatever it took he was willing to
[23:00] do even give his life on a cross
[23:04] whatever it took he was willing to do in
[23:06] order to bring Salvation to us
[23:08] look
[23:12] we can look back at many of the judges
[23:15] and see delivers like othenil
[23:18] we can see ehut
[23:21] right I mean these these people are
[23:22] willing to do all some some really tough
[23:25] things Amen in their days sham God what
[23:28] about shamgar
[23:29] right I mean uh that all he has is an ox
[23:32] goat
[23:33] he has nothing to really fight with but
[23:35] just an ox go and he's willing to go
[23:37] against 600 men
[23:40] right I mean a savior is willing to
[23:43] sacrifice their life
[23:47] there was Barack there was Gideon amen
[23:50] there was jephthah there were Sampson
[23:52] all of these are different different
[23:53] ones that God sent amen there to Israel
[23:56] and and I was just thinking to myself
[23:58] you know when when uh the children of
[24:01] Israel were were in bondage by uh the
[24:04] the uh Philistines
[24:05] Hallelujah and Goliath is making his big
[24:08] boasts about you know just don't don't
[24:11] don't let everybody die just send one
[24:13] man out here and and uh and that one man
[24:15] if he dies then we'll serve you and and
[24:18] and if uh if if if he kills me then
[24:21] we'll sir we'll serve you and if if I
[24:23] kill him then you all serve us and you
[24:25] know he's got his great boasts
[24:26] Hallelujah and everybody Amen in the
[24:30] Army when they seek Goliath come out to
[24:32] the the middle of the battlefield they
[24:34] take off running the other way even Saul
[24:37] even Saul takes off running but David
[24:39] happened to be coming just to bring some
[24:41] food to his brothers and he sees he sees
[24:44] uh Goliath come out and and and and and
[24:46] and listen let me tell you something
[24:48] amen a savior praise God is not trying
[24:52] to promote themselves in that way
[24:57] I realize what is happening when they
[24:59] enter into that attribute I hope you
[25:01] understand amen with Christ he knew
[25:04] exactly what he's doing but when this
[25:05] attribute begins to be manifested
[25:08] through us we don't realize what's
[25:09] happening
[25:11] Hallelujah David just happened to show
[25:13] up one day amen and he sees this this
[25:16] challenge go forth and he began to ask
[25:18] questions and his brother's like hey you
[25:20] need to stop asking questions you know
[25:22] get get back to taking care of the sheep
[25:24] and and do this and do that and just
[25:26] leave the battle to us and say well you
[25:28] guys are running
[25:30] you know you guys are running don't seem
[25:32] like nobody's fighting says you know I
[25:33] wouldn't mind fighting this fella he
[25:35] said I could I can't stand and hear him
[25:37] make these claims against amen the god
[25:39] that we serve we stand on promises we're
[25:42] God's chosen people let me go out
[25:44] against him he said no get out of here
[25:46] David go back to Dad go back to home
[25:48] he's like no I'm willing to go out and
[25:50] fight for my country
[25:52] David was willing to give his life
[25:55] because this attribute was actually
[25:57] being expressed through him
[25:59] he went to Saul and says look you know I
[26:01] would love to go out and fight him says
[26:03] well now you young man is no need for
[26:05] you to go out there and do that this
[26:06] man's been fighting since his Youth and
[26:07] you just young man no way he says you
[26:09] know what I killed a bear one time
[26:12] you he said well that's pretty good
[26:13] young man and say well you know not only
[26:15] that I killed a lion too like you did
[26:17] what
[26:19] says like I tell you what you got enough
[26:20] courage why don't you go and go out and
[26:21] fight this guy but before you go just
[26:23] take my armor with you and I like to ask
[26:26] this question if Saul has so much
[26:28] confidence in the armor why didn't he
[26:32] use it himself
[26:35] why didn't he use it himself
[26:38] oh my I can tell you right now it was
[26:40] not in him right to be savior
[26:45] I'm gonna take another thing another
[26:46] secret about David David was the only
[26:49] man
[26:50] in the army of Israel that could go out
[26:53] and fight Goliath
[26:54] and not die
[26:58] if he would have died God would have had
[27:01] to resurrect him again
[27:04] the reason being because David was the
[27:06] only man to have the pre he was the
[27:08] pre-anointed king
[27:10] and he had not yet come into His Place
[27:13] so he had to be protected on the
[27:15] battlefield
[27:19] you ain't going nowhere until God is
[27:21] finished with you
[27:23] nothing to fear nothing to fear you're
[27:25] going nowhere until God is finished
[27:28] but when David went out there to the
[27:30] battlefield and took life down with one
[27:32] stone
[27:35] the attribute of Salvation yes was being
[27:39] expressed through this act of taking out
[27:41] Goliath
[27:43] see this attribute has just been going
[27:44] on throughout these different characters
[27:46] I I love I love another one here that I
[27:49] wanna I wanna bring up uh
[27:53] Joseph
[27:58] was sold into slavery
[28:00] Joseph uh thrown into a pits sold into
[28:04] slavery lied on by his brothers and we
[28:07] know he was his life was a perfect type
[28:08] of Christ right he when he when he went
[28:11] to prison uh lied on by a pot of his
[28:13] wife when he went to prison had the
[28:15] Butler and the baker there interpreted
[28:16] their dreams and you know and was spot
[28:19] on with the interpretation right and uh
[28:21] we we all know the story and and it was
[28:24] a type because the butler amen was uh
[28:27] was raised back to his position but the
[28:29] the baker went on to his reward right
[28:32] but but here you know when Jesus Down
[28:34] the Cross there was two thieves on the
[28:36] cross and and once they remember me when
[28:38] you're coming to your kingdom and this
[28:39] day you'll be with me in Paradise the
[28:41] other one was lost right we we know all
[28:44] the types there but but I love the words
[28:46] that Joseph used because uh Joseph amen
[28:49] as he went through all these things and
[28:51] sometimes Hallelujah
[28:54] when this attribute is being expressed
[28:56] to us there's many things we have to go
[28:58] through that we don't enjoy
[29:01] things that we we really we rather tell
[29:03] God I rather not have that trial
[29:05] Hallelujah I'm reminded of a little
[29:08] story and I'll get back here to Joseph
[29:09] in a second but I'm reminded of a little
[29:11] story of that I heard about uh a man
[29:14] that was complaining about having to
[29:16] carry a cross you know everyone has a
[29:17] take up a cross and follow Christ and
[29:20] this man was carrying his cross and he
[29:21] got to complaining he's like Lord this
[29:23] cross is just too heavy I just can't
[29:25] carry it anymore and just kept saying
[29:27] lord it's too heavy for me to carry too
[29:29] much for me to carry so the Lord said
[29:30] okay I'll tell you what you don't have
[29:32] to carry that cross but you do have to
[29:34] carry a cross he says so what I'm going
[29:36] to do is I'm going to let you come in
[29:38] this door and drop that cross and then
[29:41] I'm going to have you go out the door
[29:42] and through another door and you have to
[29:45] find a cross in that room to carry so he
[29:47] says okay Lord that's a great deal he
[29:49] went in the carried his cross dropped it
[29:51] off walked out that door and walked
[29:53] walked into another one and he started
[29:55] looking around saying oh that's a huge
[29:57] cross I wouldn't want to carry that oh
[29:59] my who would have to carry oh look at
[30:01] all of this no way he said then he saw a
[30:04] real small cross in a little corner and
[30:07] he went running to that little cross and
[30:08] said Lord I'll carry this one right here
[30:10] I'll carry they got the little cross
[30:11] picked it up walked out I'll carry this
[30:13] one and the Lord told him said that's
[30:14] the same cross you just put down
[30:20] yeah so you're gonna have to carry
[30:22] something and as you're carry you don't
[30:24] realize the character of Christ is being
[30:28] formed in you
[30:31] so count it all joy my friends
[30:33] whatever it is that you're going through
[30:35] count it all joy God knows exactly what
[30:37] he's doing in your life
[30:39] Joseph Joseph had to learn to count
[30:42] things Joy No Matter What had happened
[30:44] he knew God God allowed these things
[30:46] happen and it's only after
[30:49] trouble hit the land of Egypt
[30:52] that he was raised out of prison and
[30:54] called them the the butler remember say
[30:56] hey this guy can interpret your dream
[30:57] Pharaoh he did it for me and I forgot
[30:59] please forgive me but this guy can get
[31:01] us out of this and as Joseph come out to
[31:03] prison amen interpret the Pharaoh what
[31:05] was going on Pharaoh Pharaoh looked and
[31:08] says you know is there anybody in our
[31:10] kingdom that got more wisdom than this
[31:12] man right here because if there's nobody
[31:14] that gots the wisdom that he has I'm not
[31:17] letting him go back to prison
[31:19] no one stood up Joseph got promoted went
[31:22] from prison
[31:23] to vice president
[31:30] Joseph brother brothers eventually came
[31:34] and I love it you know because uh I I
[31:37] heard something today Joseph didn't
[31:39] actually reveal himself to his brothers
[31:40] until their second coming
[31:43] and Christ won't reveal himself to the
[31:46] Jews until the second coming
[31:48] right so so here Joseph A Man reveals
[31:51] himself to his brothers and something
[31:52] happens here in Genesis 50 their father
[31:55] passes away and I'm just kind of rushing
[31:57] through all of these things but their
[31:58] father passes away and the brothers
[32:00] assume that Joseph is now going to get
[32:03] them
[32:04] for what they did to him in the past
[32:07] but in Genesis 50 verse 17.
[32:11] they say so shall ye say unto Joseph
[32:14] I pray thee now
[32:16] the trespass of thy Brethren and their
[32:19] sin for they did unto thee evil now we
[32:21] pray thee forgive the trespass of the
[32:23] Servants of the god of thy father and
[32:26] Joseph wept when they spake unto him
[32:29] and his Brethren also went and fell down
[32:31] before his face and they said behold we
[32:34] be thy servants look at this and Joseph
[32:36] said unto them fear not for am I in the
[32:41] place of God
[32:44] but as for you
[32:46] do you thought evil against me
[32:50] but God meant it unto good
[32:54] to bring to pass as it is this day
[32:59] to save
[33:01] much people alive this attribute of
[33:06] Salvation was being manifested in the
[33:09] life of Joseph
[33:11] but he had to go through so much before
[33:14] this attribute could be expressed he had
[33:16] no idea why God was taking him through
[33:19] all those things it was so the attribute
[33:23] could be manifested in his life
[33:27] oh my
[33:29] God now therefore fee not I will nourish
[33:32] you
[33:33] and your little ones
[33:34] and he confident in them and speak
[33:36] kindly unto them
[33:38] now
[33:41] I'm gonna just give a couple other
[33:43] people here oh my I used some some men
[33:47] in scripture what about a few women
[33:50] where this attribute is expressed
[33:52] through these women
[33:53] I got one for you just ran out of the
[33:55] gate amen and and I'll give you uh maybe
[33:59] we can pull this up in scripture too
[34:01] we'll read this one but this one
[34:03] this was a prophet
[34:07] that forgot to do a very important thing
[34:10] that God told him to do
[34:12] he forgot to actually circumcise his
[34:15] voice
[34:16] and the Bible says that the angel of the
[34:18] Lord went seeking after Moses
[34:22] to kill him but to know who his savior
[34:25] was
[34:27] his wife
[34:29] had his wife not taking the foreskin off
[34:32] of us and she she cut the foreskin off
[34:34] threw it down on the ground said you're
[34:36] a bloody man to me
[34:38] but because of her action
[34:40] it stopped the angel from slaying Moses
[34:43] his wife became a savior
[34:47] can I give you another one
[34:49] let's talk about Esther
[34:54] Esther a man was there in in the in in
[34:57] in in the palace and I love this I love
[35:00] the story of Esther you know uh she was
[35:03] she went through some hard things she
[35:05] lost both of her parents amen and losing
[35:08] her parents it really caused us to go
[35:09] probably go through a lot of things I
[35:11] like to say she was raised by a very
[35:13] strict Uncle Mordecai he wouldn't let
[35:16] her go out to the parties he wouldn't
[35:18] let her go here wouldn't let her go
[35:19] there you got to keep yourself asked to
[35:21] wait for God to send you a husband I
[35:24] mean all kind of things like this that
[35:25] she's going through with her Uncle
[35:27] Hallelujah but did not realize that she
[35:30] needed to go through that in order
[35:32] to be considered one of the women that
[35:35] the king might choose because he was
[35:38] only looking for virgins
[35:39] so here he goes amen uh here here uh
[35:42] here here you know vashti decides that
[35:45] she's not gonna go Amen to the king's
[35:47] banquet she's not she's going to have
[35:49] her own banquet my God she was a rough
[35:51] one Hallelujah but the king says you
[35:54] know what we have no more Bastion we
[35:56] won't have her we'll just find another
[35:57] queen well they choose Esther
[36:01] but I like it because as Esther's going
[36:03] through this
[36:04] outside the kingdom there's a edict
[36:06] going that they're going to kill all the
[36:08] Jews and she was told don't share who
[36:10] you are don't tell them who you are
[36:11] don't say anything now is the time for
[36:14] her to reveal her true identity
[36:16] when the pressure was on
[36:18] and I love it because she was she was
[36:20] she like look I'm in the Kingdom now and
[36:22] I'm not going to tell them I'm a Jew I
[36:24] got here this far by not saying it I'm
[36:27] not gonna say it now
[36:28] Mordecai say look don't don't think
[36:30] because you're in the Kingdom don't
[36:32] think that that you're gonna you you you
[36:34] uh you're not going to be a part of this
[36:36] don't think that once he finds out he
[36:38] gonna kill you too he says how do you
[36:39] know you have not come to the kingdom
[36:42] for such a time as this
[36:46] Mr might have thought
[36:49] her greatest role
[36:52] was to be Queen
[36:55] yeah that's good Esther found out
[36:58] when she revealed Mordecai's plan
[37:00] because understand in the Kingdom there
[37:02] was only two people higher than Mordecai
[37:06] one was the king and the other was Queen
[37:09] Esther
[37:11] and when she when he got invited to the
[37:13] banquet Esther could call for him to
[37:15] come to the banquet as to had all kind
[37:16] of power and authority and when he got
[37:18] invited Esther begin to reveal the plan
[37:20] and then and and he realized my God The
[37:23] Gallows that he built for somebody else
[37:25] he was going to hang from himself
[37:27] Esther stepped in on behalf of her
[37:31] people after that three-day fast
[37:34] she went from just being Queen God's
[37:36] idea
[37:38] God's thoughts of Esther
[37:40] was higher than Queen
[37:43] because Esther was the only one in the
[37:46] Kingdom
[37:47] that could act as Savior
[37:55] What a Mighty God
[38:01] there's another character here and
[38:04] that I want to
[38:06] I want to bring in and
[38:14] rehab
[38:19] Rahab let the spies come
[38:21] into her home and and you know maybe
[38:24] they thought that this was some new
[38:26] customers
[38:27] but Rahab no no no no I'm not I'm not
[38:29] I'm not having you over for that I need
[38:31] to talk to you about something
[38:33] because you know we heard that you all
[38:35] did this you know did that and this
[38:37] whole city is scared of what's getting
[38:38] ready to happen here all I'm asking is
[38:41] for protection
[38:43] and and here's here's the beautiful
[38:45] thing that I want I want to I want to
[38:46] make sure we get Rahab did not only ask
[38:49] for protection for herself
[38:55] savior's not just thinking about
[38:56] themselves
[38:59] amen but Rahab began to ask for her
[39:02] parents
[39:04] I mean anybody and they say look if you
[39:06] get your mama you get your daddy you get
[39:08] your brother you get your sister if you
[39:10] get them in the house this Scarlet
[39:13] threat that we told you to put out we're
[39:14] gonna have this house protected
[39:16] and I love it because when the walls
[39:18] came down her house was actually built
[39:20] on top of the wall so every piece of the
[39:23] Wall came down except where rehab's
[39:25] house was
[39:27] I wanna I wanna I wanna I wanna inject
[39:31] this I just want to inject a little
[39:32] quote here
[39:36] in God's rap gift brother Bram says
[39:38] Rahab the Harlot
[39:40] that we're all familiar with
[39:43] being a young girl that was turned on
[39:44] the street by a heathen father and
[39:46] mother now think about that rehab was
[39:49] turned on the street
[39:51] by her father and her mother thinking
[39:53] now
[39:55] back then we know you know women might
[39:57] not have been the value you know that
[40:00] maybe the the value that father had for
[40:02] his daughter might not have been there
[40:04] but for a mother to push her daughter
[40:07] out into a lifestyle like this it just
[40:10] it just grips my heart how could a
[40:11] mother agree to do this
[40:14] How could a mother I mean a father
[40:16] shouldn't do it either right but how
[40:18] could a father and a mother come that
[40:20] we're going to turn our daughter out in
[40:22] order to bring food here into our house
[40:24] look at what brother Brown said young
[40:26] girl that was turned on the street by a
[40:28] heathen father mother that put her on
[40:30] the street because she was beautiful and
[40:33] was to bring an income to them on
[40:34] prostitution and yet down in this
[40:37] immoral girl that was turned on the
[40:39] street she had heard that there was a
[40:41] God who answered prayer and the first
[40:44] opportunity she got to accept that God
[40:46] or do something for him she did it and
[40:50] God spared her life and saved the father
[40:52] and mother and a family she fell in love
[40:55] with a general in the army of Israel we
[40:57] found in history and married this
[40:58] General and their courtship was
[40:59] wonderful and finally it settled down
[41:01] and lived at Bethlehem and we know
[41:03] Christ came through that lineage
[41:05] but here's the thing that really just
[41:06] troubled me that her father and mother
[41:09] would agree to sell her for income
[41:12] now
[41:14] if there was any person
[41:17] that needed to have a complex
[41:21] with their parents
[41:24] if there was any person that would be
[41:27] justified
[41:28] to have a complex amen with their
[41:32] parents Rahab is that person
[41:36] but rather than take on a complex when
[41:39] it came time for deliverance oh
[41:41] Hallelujah she's asking for the same man
[41:45] that sold her out there put her out
[41:46] there in prostitution the same Mama that
[41:49] put in process can I can my mama be safe
[41:52] can my daddy be said Can my brothers can
[41:54] my son can anybody be safe as long as
[41:57] you get them into the house
[42:00] rehab
[42:04] have the attribute
[42:07] a prostitute
[42:10] has the attribute of salvation
[42:13] being manifested
[42:16] in her life
[42:18] when I thought about rehab I said oh my
[42:20] my my my my
[42:23] what about our Lord and our savior who
[42:25] went to a cross when everybody rejected
[42:27] him
[42:28] but yet he was willing to go to the
[42:29] Cross no matter what they said about him
[42:31] he was still willing to go to the Cross
[42:32] uh Savers got to be willing to give
[42:34] their all
[42:37] this attribute being expressed
[42:39] you know
[42:41] I was uh
[42:43] thinking
[42:45] when I was a young young young lad
[42:48] roughly four or five years old
[42:51] I had a little situation in my life
[42:53] where
[42:54] I had some cousins and they were
[42:57] babysitting me and
[42:59] and they went to a pool one day and
[43:01] and they went to swim and they really
[43:04] couldn't swim so they stayed in the
[43:06] shallow parts of the water where they
[43:07] could stand above the water
[43:09] well I was too young to get into the
[43:11] pool so I was just playing around the
[43:13] pool and and I would take a rock and
[43:15] throw it in a rock and and and and lift
[43:17] it out
[43:18] and I just kept doing that just moving
[43:20] around the perimeter of the pool
[43:22] and I got down to the deep end and I
[43:24] threw that rock in and went to lift it
[43:25] out and when I went to lift it out I let
[43:28] it go in a little bit too deep
[43:30] and I fell into the water
[43:33] and when I fell into the water uh I
[43:36] don't remember anything else
[43:39] but what they told me or I could the
[43:41] part that I do remember is waking up in
[43:42] the lap of a fireman well they told me
[43:45] what had happened is that there was a a
[43:47] a a uh a lifeguard that she wasn't on
[43:51] duty that day and she happened to be
[43:54] skating by the pool at the time that I
[43:56] fell in so she took off one skate
[43:59] and she couldn't get the other skate off
[44:01] and she jumped inside the pool to get me
[44:03] out of the deep end and when she got me
[44:05] out they called all the authorities and
[44:07] police came the firemen came and they
[44:10] even had a helicopter there to think
[44:11] they were gonna you know Fly Me Away
[44:13] somewhere and and while I mean all these
[44:15] people are gathered and I'm I'm just out
[44:18] you know and um and I don't know what
[44:21] they did but all of a sudden my eyes
[44:23] just popped open and I'm looking at the
[44:25] firemen I'm like what is going on what
[44:27] what this what just happened here and uh
[44:30] and and and and when they told me what
[44:32] had happened that this this young lady
[44:34] with the one skate just happened to jump
[44:36] in
[44:37] and get me out do you realize what
[44:39] happened that day that lady
[44:42] became
[44:43] a savior to me
[44:47] I don't even know her name
[44:49] I don't know where she lived I I mean I
[44:52] don't know I I don't know anything about
[44:55] it I've never seen her since that day
[44:56] but on that day she became a savior to
[45:00] me
[45:03] not to myself thank God for her saving
[45:05] me I wouldn't be standing here today
[45:08] but you know what
[45:10] I needed something greater than her
[45:14] I needed a savior greater than her
[45:18] you want to know why I needed to save
[45:19] your greater than her because I was
[45:22] sinking
[45:24] deep in
[45:26] far from the peaceful Shore very deeply
[45:30] staying within I was sinking to rise no
[45:34] more but the master of the sea heard my
[45:38] despairing cry and from the waters
[45:42] he Lifted Me
[45:44] now safe
[45:47] am I
[45:50] see we thank God for what men have been
[45:53] able to do for us through uh through our
[45:55] life but God we needed Christ more than
[45:57] we needed men because man could not
[46:00] redeem us
[46:01] man could not put us back in that place
[46:03] or even give us the the route to get
[46:06] back to that place where there is no
[46:07] more sin
[46:08] there is no more sickness there is no
[46:11] more disease there is nothing that we
[46:13] have to fear nothing we have to work no
[46:14] more graveyards only Christ could put us
[46:16] on the path to get us back to that place
[46:18] we thank God for him being our savior
[46:21] brother random makes this statement in
[46:24] smyrnian church age

[46:28] Jehovah born crying over a manure pile
[46:32] Jehovah born in a manger of straw

[46:38] proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals
[46:40] that have evolved their own Theology and
[46:42] denied the truth of god Jehovah God a
[46:44] crying baby in a stinking Barn

[46:48] proud holding up our nose is criticizing
[46:50] and and acting as though we were

[47:06] sign of a white collared priesthood not
[47:08] the sign of wealth and power there's
[47:10] nothing in this sign that you'll want
[47:13] or think suitable but it is an
[47:15] everlasting sign it is the greatest sign
[47:17] of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard
[47:20] bruised and bleeding with thorns on his
[47:22] brow spit on his face mocked and said it
[47:26] not Jehovah despised and rejected
[47:28] hanging naked upon the cross
[47:30] while the Hypocrites jeered and dared
[47:32] him to come down off the cross Jehovah
[47:35] dying look at this Jehovah praying
[47:39] and nothing happening Jehovah praying
[47:42] and nothing happening
[47:45] and we get discouraged when we pray
[47:48] and nothing happens
[47:50] well Jehovah also prayed
[47:52] and nothing happened
[47:56] then Jehovah died
[47:59] that is a sign for all men now there
[48:02] isn't another like it it is the great
[48:04] one then Darkness Came Upon the Earth
[48:08] they put him in a tomb
[48:10] those three days and nights until an
[48:13] earthquake shattered the Gloom of the
[48:14] night and it came forth Jehovah came
[48:16] forth
[48:18] Jehovah ascended on high
[48:20] then Jehovah returned to indwell his
[48:23] church Jehovah came back with a mighty
[48:26] rushing wind and flames of fire

[48:31] of his church and Empower his people
[48:34] once more Jehovah came
[48:37] and this time to stay in his people
[48:39] and again

[48:44] how does he do it now it's through his
[48:45] people
[48:46] he raises the dead and manifests himself
[48:49] by the spirit Jehovah came back
[48:52] speaking in tongues and giving an answer
[48:55] back in interpretation
[48:57] Jehovah came down and he raised the
[48:59] prostitute
[49:00] to sin no more
[49:03] he came down to the drunkard with fly
[49:05] blows on his face as he lay unconscious
[49:07] in the gutter yes Jehovah came to

[49:58] father we can look at how you've
[50:00] manifested yourself through all these

[50:06] but the Lord they were people just like
[50:07] us going through things just like we go
[50:10] through it
[50:12] but I pray Lord that you would help us
[50:13] to realize and see
[50:16] that you're using Everything For Your
[50:18] Glory and for your honor
[50:20] that your attributes
[50:23] might be expressed in and through us
[50:28] I know Lord that you started the year
[50:31] off here at this church
[50:34] with yielding
[50:36] yielding to the perfect will of God and
[50:38] knowing the perfect will of God and Lord
[50:40] even on the East Coast
[50:42] the very Sunday that brother Aaron was
[50:44] preaching at here
[50:46] I had a brother from my church here and
[50:48] he came and told me I said brother Aaron
[50:49] preached the exact same sermon that you
[50:51] preached at home

[51:17] that you might get all the glory and all
[51:19] the honor out of our Lives sometimes we
[51:21] don't understand it but it's not for us
[51:23] to understand it
[51:25] is for us to believe and trust
[51:28] that you work in all things together
[51:31] for the good
