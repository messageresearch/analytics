TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Isaiah chap 11 verses 9 and 10 and I'm jumping into the middle of this reading I've been studying from verse one even on uh through the whole chapter actually and there's a lot there if some of you want to go back and read through this you'll be able to steal some of my thunder to kind of catch the full picture for this but I'm just going to focus on one portion of verse 10 today but there's a lot of context here in this that you need that you need to really understand the full thrust of what's being expressed here they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ins sign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious amen God bless you you can be seated just pray for me tonight as we get started it's still just feeling pretty weak in my body tonight maybe a little bit my voice in my throat but we trust that by God's grace we'll be able to deliver what's in our hearts my title is uh anointed by accepting him hopefully going to come to a statement later on in the Christ is the mystery God revealed that kind of gives some context to that was wrestling with uh just exactly how to title this I sometimes want or most of the time I want you to be able to look at your notes or hear the title and it kind of give you some idea of where we're at in the scripture and and itself speak to you uh this kind of was quickened to me this afternoon really fitting for this introductory part of going into Isaiah 11 anointed by accepting him now if you look at Revelations chap 21 I'm just going to jump right into a lot of places we've been lately so I feel that we can do this says in verse three and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying this is after we see the New Jerusalem the city of God descend Out of Heaven from God and come to the Earth the new Heaven and new earth the Tabernacle of God is with men behold the Tabernacle of God God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow no crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away if you think about uh the sermon we ministered on no more Shadows we saw that God used things throughout uses things throughout time and on Earth to signify something to foreshadow something and then when the substance comes maybe there's no use for the shadow anymore and we could say the same about sorrow and crying and pain that God uses those things to perfect our character he uses them to get our attention and godly sorrow leads to repentance and a lot of these things that are here in this scripture that God has used during time he'll have no need for them anymore they'll have no purpose in God's economy so all the former things even death which is just used to bring a Believer into the presence of God that will have no use anymore so there'll be no more death no pain no sorrow no crime as he wipes all the tears from her eyes and all the former things are passed away and it says that God the Tabernacle of God will be with men and he will dwell with them and so here we see that God is now fully tabernacled not just in Shadows or types not just in Spirit uh not just in in in measure but he is fully tabernacled in this New Jerusalem he's reached his expression he's achieved what he's wanted to achieve his purpose is fulfilled so now the new Jerusalem Christ and his bride uh in that place become the habitation of God it's where God is dwelling where God is manifesting as brother B uses the term God is resident with man and that takes place here as we read it in Revelations 21 want you to get this thought of now God is saying here is where I dwell on earth now for all eternity and in the sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride we've been mentioning how that brother brandom connects the Redemption of the individual to the world's Redemption so as we look at this stage of of Eternity or this setting of Eternity God comes down to dwell and he's going to be dwelling in the earth and God's habitation is be upon the Earth and so this is the Earth's Redemption and the stages that God goes through to redeem the individual he goes through to redeem the Earth and that's been an important parallel that we've been tracking and so brother M makes this statement God has tabernacled in Man by redeeming him by these three processes we know that's justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost we see that as we kind of break it out that's the new birth he says that God has tabernacled Man by redeeming him through this process now God is going to redeem the Earth in Tabernacle in the Earth this is what we read in Revelations 21 God is going to redeem the Earth and Tabernacle in the Earth with his subjects of the earth which he brought forth from the earth and through sin it fell he had to let he let it go had to let it go on but now he sent Jesus to redeem that Fallen Earth Earth which we are a part of now this uh these steps to me are important to uh just really anchor this down in our hearts because to me this is the real key from this sermon future home what God does to redeem the individual so that he can Tabernacle in the individual God's going to do the Earth so you see a parallel what God does to the Earth he does to the individual God does to the Earth he does to the individual and now God is going to come and dwell or Tabernacle in the earth and brother B says well what he does to Tabernacle in the earth he's already for shadowed it by doing that to you amen brought you through a process of redemption so he could dwell in you he says it again in another place in future home to redeem the earth now it's been Justified it's been Sanctified called and claimed now it's to receive its baptism of fire and be cleansed for Jesus and his bride and you are these other parts that's draw up out of the earth the earth your he says the Earth that you're a part of the earth your body so as he said that he sent Jesus to redeem the Fallen Earth which we are a part of he comes back to or maybe I'm a little bit earlier in this he says he's going to redeem the Earth your body is a part of the earth so this was something someone shared with me that some of the things just really anchored in their mind about eternity uh when they realize that's right we're we come from the earth these bodies are redeemed and this Earth is a is part of God's Plan of Redemption so God's going to give Redemption to the Earth and it really connects things to see that so to redeem the Earth it's been Justified Sanctified and it's going to receive the bap ISM of fire which is the three processes that we go through for God to Tabernacle in US says it again now now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem this world he's done the same plan to redeem his people we're using this again repetition just to kind of anchor this in our hearts what God does to the individual he does to the Earth and if there's a three-part process to redeem us there's a three-part process to redeem the Earth and and that's the process of redemption now I say that and there's a lot that comes with Redemption Beyond just saying he Tabernacles or he's resident because it's going to take all eternity once the Earth is redeemed to unfold what that Redemption really means so we know that he says is the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both the world and the persons that live in it he says in the sermon who is this mezic the stages of Eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed there's still three stages to Perfection just like he redeems the world the same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages so with giving some of that background tonight some of that Foundation we notice that this Plan of Redemption for the Earth parallels The Plan of Salvation for the individual now we've read in Numbers chapter 14: 21 and this is where I'm uh building off of this thought this process of redemption what God does to the individual he does to the Earth says but as truly as I live the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord and the last two sermons we preached was to show that if the Earth is going to be filled with his glory then there's a measure of Glory in my life that's going to fill me that this my life is going to be filled with his glory this Earth is going to be filled with his glory I'm going to manifest my measure of Glory his glory is to fill us I may not have all the fullness of God in the way that Christ had it but all that I have can be fully God that he's to dwell in me he's to take full possession and I I kind of held off on this statement but I think it just has a lot of weight to it tonight in the sermon oness brother R says he's talking about how that some of you got just enough anointing enough Holy Ghost to quit you're lying and cheating and stealing quit smoking a and sometimes you have just enough of an experience in church with God to where we stop doing certain things but God just doesn't want to challenge us and move within the emotional realm to Quicken us to some sort of discipline or putting things away but he really he wants to Anchor in our hearts a a and give us the Holy Ghost down in our souls and then once we've received that in our souls now he says God wants to fill every fiber of his church he says he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrender to God till his word is just living right through you this is God's plan this is his objective the very ultimate objective of God is to declare his glory now where is it going to be declared it's going to be declared in you it's going to be declared in flesh and God wants to not just feel your soul but he wants to F every fiber of your being where that Christ that's down on the inside who has who in all the fullness of God dwells he wants to just radiate out from that place pulsating through you living through you governing your thoughts and your responses a and manifesting himself through your person so I'd say that as God has taken will take the Earth through these three processes and it says that his glory will fill the Earth then I'm saying that if the glory will fill the Earth then the glory of God can fill you then Isaiah 11:9 just thank you for your help this evening you're being very attentive and Isaiah 11:9 he says they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain there's some references there that you could go back and read and kind of pick up the full picture of what he's looking at but they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain it gives the image of Zion there gives us this image of of some Perfection some uh the the the the Zion Kingdom it says for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea now if you stayed with me just through these first uh 15 minutes or so that should click right there already what I'm aiming at that if the whole earth is going to be full of his glory and then we're g we need to be full of his glory the Bible says the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea and this parallel process we see to the Earth then we're seeing this parallel process for us as a Believer I hope it's adding layers to your life or gives you some meaning and sense and purpose sometimes well you need the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost and you need the Holy Ghost we need to be born again you must be born again and there's just this little disconnect sometimes in our minds we say well now that I've received the Holy Ghost now that I've been born again uh what's next and it can just kind of have this idea well you just need to buy time until we can find that last soul and they're all going to leave no this is that's when it all starts that's when the real sweetness begins and the journey with God and Walking with God and things getting greater and God said I want to fill every fiber of your being I'm living in your soul that I can live in every every part and aspect of your life so here it says the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea it's describing a time when the knowledge of the Lord is going to fill up the Earth entirely there going to be some uh dominance of the knowledge of the Lord so some filling up I try to give some more color to that here in a moment I want to focus on this phrase as the waters cover the sea quite a statement uh actually I guess if you read it it might be kind of confusing I thought the W Seas were Waters but the the phrasing there though it might be obscured by the way that they translate as the waters cover the sea it's dividing between the waters the actual substance of the H2O and the salt water and the depths and the bottom of the sea so the sea is just not merely comprised of water with endless depth but there's some depth to it and so it says that the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth as the waters cover or fill the sea and I want you to uh uh really take this picture in your mind as some of the tallest I guess you say tallest mountains on Earth are below water and some of the deepest valleys are are below below the surface of the water but the ocean water covers every crevice every trench every cap spreading out to all sorts of inlets a a and the the Sea and the Sea Flor and every cave it's all filled up with the water and water we know will flow downhill naturally from the highest point to the lowest point a and and that's what governs the the the direction of of water but ultimately it's gravity which is the Ultimate Force that's working upon the water and it it'll it'll follow this is the part if you could just kind of catch this L to me when I was just kind of arranging where these scriptures going to be I was like I could stop right here I know who wants me to but it's going to depend on how hard you amen when don't we make this point but it's going to follow the path of least resistance that water is going to wherever there'll be a yielding to it the water is going to cover it up wherever there's going to be an opening up to it the water's going to cover up and it's going to flow downhill that's why sometimes your neighbor can be in a flood plane and you may not be because you're on a higher level than for many miles or a long stretch cuz the water is not going to going to rise first it's going to flow downhill and fill everything up before it gets higher if we want to go higher maybe we going need to go a little bit deeper and let our experience get a little bit richer and that water that's going to cover every all the part of the earth gravity is this Force upon it and it's going to take the path the path of least resistance I say let's not resist the floods not resist the water let it flow so it's as the waters spread themselves over the bottom of the ocean of the Seas and entirely fill all the channels of the sea so shall the knowledge of the Lord spread like that until the Earth is completely covered so as the water we look in the ocean and they don't find a little pocket dry pocket in the bottom of the sea they don't find a dry trench and they just go well we sent something down there and we finally got to a spot where it's dry just nothing was down there I it it's it pervades it it flows it fills everything up and so that's a quite a picture that this writer is wanting us to see in our minds that just as the oceans are filled up so God's knowledge is to fill the Earth completely cover it now another point that we want to look at tonight is that the knowledge of the lord it's God's knowledge and it's not necessarily speaking of our knowledge of him because even as we read last service I believe it was that there's there's a knowledge that passeth knowledge a wisdom or understanding that passeth knowledge in other words it's like it can't really be known like this isn't something you could just learn this is just something you could pick up and read and figure out so this knowledge that we have passes knowledge and that it's not really something you just figure out or no it's got to be something divinely revealed and if we could look at it from this perspective I think it kind of helps click in a lot of ways that when it says the knowledge of the Lord is the Lord's knowledge or God's knowledge and it means his opinion it means his judgment it means his discernment so it's not just that everyone's like God oh yeah I know him but God I know him completely know him inside out know everything about him well it's going to take eternity to reveal him well I already know it it's all there got it all figured out no it means God's knowledge is his judgment his opinion his discernment in 1st Samuel chapter 2:3 I think this scripture will help bring this out Hannah's praying and it the this part here may be the boasting of the other wife that she's rorting to who was so proud of how many children she had Hannah having none but she says talk no more so exceeding proud let not arrogancy come out of your mouth and then she makes this statement that I believe stands regardless of who she's directing it too it fits for all time and purpose for the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed doesn't mean that God's just really really smart and and got a really big brain and a high IQ it's God is the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed no it's Hannah is declaring that God knows the heart God knows the ways of man God knows what motivates man God knows what makes man click he knows what is his motivation and his ambition God judges a man's motive and objective when he says that God is a god of knowledge that the Earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord it speaks of a discernment and a recognition of things in the heart and maybe we'll come to this in a future service and and this has some thrust if I can just go ahead and say it now that as you read uh chapter 11 there's something about this judgment and this discernment and this knowledge where it says they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain it's the knowledge of the Lord that's somehow holding that at Bay and if I'm wanting to bring a parallel for us that we can have the knowledge of the Lord that fills up our being it's going to be the very thing that knows motives and objectives and influences in detours and all sorts of things that can try to happen to an individual and through the knowledge of God we can say whoa buddy that's enough that's right I was listening to a sermon just uh such an incredible testimony that I could share personally I began to listen to it last night and then I I I I I at a certain point I had fell asleep and so this morning I went back to the part I thought I was about at when I'd fallen asleep and um Elizabeth had finished listening to it I hadn't finished listening to it yet and she said did you finish listening to that and I said I I I hadn't yet she said it's just so profound and so spot on to some things in our lives and she said I thought maybe you picked it out just for those very reasons said I I hadn't even listened to that part yet I fast forwarded to the very end to listen to it and brother Bram it just it was so personal for me so wonderful and but he talks about in a particular instance he says he mentions the meanness of Satan and just how mean the Devil is a and this is and how cruel the world is to people how mean the devil is to people and I believe that God's knowledge is to recognize Satan's how he tries to take advantage of us and recognize the devil and every one of his tricks that's what it means to have the knowledge of the lord it's something that knows the pride of man and the heart of man the Lord is a god of knowledge this is what the knowledge of the Lord means in Jeremiah 17:9 and 10 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it wouldn't you want to know it when even ourselves sometimes our hearts work against us and motivate and influence it us in a way and we're pretty sure about it and we think we know but our hearts are even deceiving us now if we really just took a moment to ponder that we might get locked up tonight be like oh my goodness this is scary I can't believe I'm even trying to live this thing out can't even trust my own heart but he says I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns that's the seat of emotion and affection even use that word of the kidneys or something that it's bound up in that I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings this is the knowledge of the Lord so when it says that for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord it shall be full of a correct understanding of things right is that awesome I I hope that's awesome to you I built a whole sermon around that just maybe a whole portion of this series around that thought that the knowledge of the lord it's going to be full of the correct way of seeing things amen it's gonna there's going to be the correct view there's going to be the Earth is going to have some fullness of the the the understanding of God's Perfections and his plan and the claims of God what God wants done how things ought to be operated how things ought to be the Earth is going to be full of the correct understanding of things so as we read that and we get this picture in our minds as the waters cover the sea the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord well I've been told not to apologize so I don't know how I can phrase this without apologizing but as a lawyer I could probably figure it out I hope you're not sorry for coming tonight if you felt that I oversold the sermon but the infinite wisdom of God this eternal wisdom of God will prevail pervade the whole earth and it's not just again it's not that the everyone on Earth is going to be like got it all appear not every it's not that the whole earth is everyone everything's going to have the knowledge of God or the knowledge of the Divine I don't think that's the right way to look at this but there's some if I could even use this by way of analogy this is pointing to a time I want you to have that in your mind it's pointing to a time when the whole earth is going to be full of the knowledge of the Lord and even now it's being filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the word is preached as the word is expressed a a and the world is without excuse that's right creation itself is declared God's glory declares declaring the mind of God and creation speaks of something Divine and eternal so that the Bible says they're without excuse as we read already in Psalm 19: 1-6 I know we read all these verses earlier I want to read them again in this context so we could recognize how the knowledge of the Lord is going to fill up the whole earth it has one through whom it's being expressed there's something declaring it something radiating it it's not that everyone on the earth had any given time or animal life and plant life and all those things we're going to say are going to have some actual knowledge of God but there's going to be some justice and judgment in the people of God that's unhindered unrestricted not governed by a deceitful heart not influenced by the unkindness of man and it's going to Reign and Rule throughout the entire world the Bible says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto Day utth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge now this is where we can just see in the heavens that the sun and the moon and the stars they're speaking they're declaring God's glory then it says there's no speech nor language where their voice is not heard so now it's showing that there's some expression in the heavens of God's glory to the Earth says their line has gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world notice that image of how these these lights are filling up the Earth Earth it's broadcasting things expressing things showing things and maybe not everything on Earth is that light not everything on Earth is is reflecting that light but the light's there right says in them hath he set a tabernacle of the for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of heaven and his circuit under the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof the whole world is not the son nor does the whole world and all that in it have it the have that light but all are under its influence true that has some impact in some way this chain reaction of the sunlight upon the elements of the earth impacts everything within it and is is I would even say if that if the skeptic says oh yeah but what about those things that live in caves and and never see the sunlight whatever's there that they're feeding on originated from the the nutrients and the life and the water and everything else that makes its way there is under the influence of that so sunlight that's you in light it's under the influence of that it's under its shadow so to say so to speak and so in the same way that we see the influence of the heavens and the of the firmament in the heavens and the light Isaiah prophesies that the knowledge of the Lord will fill up the Earth as the waters cover the sea it's going to have preeminence it's going to have influence it's going to have control it speaks if you if if you're just maybe a little bit there missing for you as where the direction I I wanted to come I'm not wanting to get into a lot of these details I just feel like I wouldn't have the time that how is that going to be set in that time where there's going to be a rain A Reign of righteousness and a reign of light and a reign of peace and Universal peace and it's going to be because the knowledge of the Lord Reigns Supreme and there's a yielding of everything to that knowledge to that Justice to that discernment not that everyone has to have their head filled with his with with with a knowing him and knowing everything about him but it's to be full of his knowledge which is his discernment now I want to read a lengthy statement to you and just as a little bit way of a pivot here just sensitive to time especially on Wednesday night and and just see how this the concept of knowledge I'm wanting knowledge not to be far from you but this is going to fill uh fit in a lot too with the fullness and we're speaking on of Glory now I says what was Jesus manifested for to show God he was God he had to be he said no man could die no Prophet could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the Kings he was the history he was he that was to come he that was he that is and he that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose now it just brings Christ right into our view in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily now he's going to show us come back to the purpose and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the pr pinenes preeminence in the church the position his place in the church this is Christ who is the fullness of the godhead bodily being placed in the church that means the fullness has to be there Christ to is the fullness having preeminence brings the fullness he says Jesus said he that believeth on me The Works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do for I go to my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can see it that they can let the word think of how he's phrasing that they can let the word Jesus so seen it so was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed now he he he's not going back just to describe Jesus he's trying to amplify that somebody that he can get to see it somebody that he can get to see it and let the word manifest so they can let the word he says Christ was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed now he Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed think of this he wants to get somebody that can see it so that we who are born perfectly for this day God can express himself by every move and we can be God's revelation we can be God revealed make every promise in the last day be revealed now he could go back and pick up what these other fellas had left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the Seven Seals that brings us to quite a climactic moment in scripture and what it would mean for these seals to be open and these to be revealed his holy spirit's revealing the mystery of the Seven Seals through the Revelation comes knowledge comes un some understanding he is expressing himself that is his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his three-fold manifestation first to express himself s in Christ then Express himself to the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them right I I I kind of understand looking at it now I'm not feeling sorry for you but maybe it's going to take a little bit of work tonight maybe it's not fair on a Wednesday night this late to make you do the work but just as the waters cover the sea and as it fills up it's flowing downhill Gravity Force in it and it's going to fill up wherever it yields wherever it relents the path of least resistance at the opening of the seals there's been a pouring out and a revealing of Christ coming down from heaven this great his revelation of his person as it comes down and it's wanting to fill every fiber of this church and to fill it up fully and completely but but it's not just sitting there coming and and and moving upon one without uh without some yielding on your part cuz it says when it lets the word go through them they say Lord fill up these depths why don't you take I have preeminence in my heart and in my life the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them Hallelujah beautiful but when they accept a hybrid denomination how can they how can the word go through it that would make a good name for a hybrid card call it denomination he says it's grounded then it causes a short and blows ause but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself there's that free the Earth is going to be full of the knowledge of the Lord what I'm wanting you to see yourself is see yourself in that picture see yourself in that picture I we we hopefully inspired you to manifest your measure of Glory now there's some connection then that there's some knowledge of the Divine there's some revelation of Christ that we have to give ourselves to that we have to let uh let flow through us let it go through us let that current flow freely in order for the word of God to EXP Express itself says the works that I do shall you do also he says here that ye shall ye be also yes and in the last days it shall come to pass brings this right into Malachi 4 because there's so much of a there it's such a critical fundamental part of what we believe that God sent a prophet and listen the message has been given we're we're GNA never mature out of the message and that's one of the things that's really striking uh when when when people come uh to try to tell you that you're wrong one of the most important things when you tell somebody that they're wrong is to show them how they can be right but most of the people that'll come to you and tell you that you're wrong for believing the message just want you to feel wrong like they feel wrong because they can't show you anything right there there's no truth that they've come to because this message fulfills Malachi 4 The Turning of the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and he says in there now I want this to have I want it to hit I want to have some punch I want you to feel a little bit it's not so much just believing that God sent a prophet and Vindicated the message but it had a purpose cuz he says and there in that turning back of our hearts in that enlarging in our hearts in giving us this revelation of his person and in there be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence is in his church through that he's going to have preeminence in you through this message he's going to have preeminence in you oh if you stop listening to the word if you haven't yielded yourself to the voice of this hour he can never have the preeminence in you that's how movements and man kind and Humanity get in the way and Lead You astray but it's in there there comes a time when he can express himself in the fullness of the godhead deity through his church and have preeminence in in this church he says oh my I don't know if you're reading ahead of me here but the anointed man now the anointed people he says again oh my I could have titled this oh my oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom now pause there just think of that in there there'd be a time to come forth time come forth a timing a dispensation of the fullness to express himself and it was the anointed man now the anointed people the anointed man was the revelation of God the anointed man was manifested for a purpose now it's the anointed people and with the anointed people it brings the bride abely with the anointed bridegroom and he says anointed by accepting what Eve turned down and Adam anointed by accepting something he said he's expressing himself and the Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them when the current is Flowing freely the word of God expresses itself so how is it that we become the anointed people by accepting he says what Eve turned down he says and Adam they both turned it down coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit that's a huge key there because it says not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord so it's not by human knowledge not by human power not by human ability but by his spirit and his word is spirit my word is spirit he says see Anointed with the word I catch this what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept it's not a something it's not an it his his preferred pronouns he him it's a he it's a person it's Christ he comes back and we accept so we're anointed by accepting him you're anointed by accepting his re reation as as the word comes forth and you receive it you're anointed by the word you receive as the word is preached and you receive it you're anointed by the word that is received listen if Divine Deliverance is preached receive it if the word preach preaches peace then receive it because you'll be anointed by the word that you receive anointed by accepting him because he come comes back and we accept now to connect this back in Isaiah Isaiah chapter 11: 10 the whole Earth shall be full the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse what a what humble description now doesn't mention David it mentions the root of Jesse which shall stand for an inside of the people who is this one it's Christ and it says he's an ins sign a super sign not just to the Jews now to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious now what does it say it says to it shall the Gentiles seek doesn't mean to it shall the Gentiles just kind oh that's cool you or it's just going to kind of happen oh whoa oh ah cool yeah yeah that that's pretty cool they said they're going to seek it going to be something stand out something to get their attention some revelation of Christ he says the Holy Spirit Will Reveal all the mystery of the Seven Seals expressing himself that's his purpose and what is it the living bread of life bringing forth a gentile bride and to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious I want to maybe end tonight I still got a few more minutes left I think I'll be able to go a little bit further but I want you to In This Way think of it this way that there's got to be some seeking there there's got to be a hungering and the thirsting after this right and it's not this isn't a I I I I think I think just maybe the things that I have here before me making maybe maybe it's making just more sense to me as I come to it there's there's a lot of ideas that we have in terms of power and manifestation and what it's going to feel like and what it's going to look like and there's a lot of things said about Revelation knowledge re uh understanding teaching a a and the like to where you kind of think wow learning is bad and understanding is bad and knowledge is bad and wisdom is bad and all these things are bad it's like yeah if they're all human they're bad in the same way that tongues and dancing and shouting and blood pouring out of your hands and sweating and falling out P if it's just all human it's not any good right and so there's there's such a balance in the word of God that we have to come to an understanding that what we want is we want the truth that's what we want we want the truth we want the truth of it it says in Proverbs 2: 1-6 my son if thou will receive my words what did Brother bam say as we read this he wants somebody that can see it that they can let the [Applause] word and and someone who can uh become the word when it lets the word go through them when the current is Flowing freely and so now it's expressing it in this way that if th will receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thy ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding I don't think it'd be wrong for us to pray for these things you were to call upon the Lord for Revelation more than anything that that's knowledge of the Divine that's understanding God and His program that's that's that's the correct view of things I want to Incline my ear into wisdom apply my heart to understanding y if Thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding if you cry for it if you cry after knowledge if your supplications and your prayers you're lifting up your voice for understanding if thou th seekest her as silver maybe that doesn't resonate so much with us the these days because we don't think in terms of silver or Hidden Treasures but if you seek after wealth popularity Fame whatever it might be that some some sort of resource if you seek her as silver in searches for her as for hid Treasures the things that we mind for the things that we search for the hours we'll spend researching something and Googling something and trying to get the the bottom of something if you'll seek after her like you do a paycheck if you seek after her like you would for hid Treasures if you seek after her like you do for some answers as it says the Gentiles will seek after him he comes back and we accept him we'll seek after him then Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God maybe we'll break into it a little bit in the next service where this knowledge begins that's right here in these scriptures Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding if he's speaking there's knowledge there's speaking there's understanding think of that no matter what it is in the whole spectrum of things if we try to pit the fundamentalist against the uh uh the Pentecostals or however that uh that that dichotomy is sometimes if it's in the word of God it's knowledge and understanding whether it be the gifts and Divine Healing and the manifestation of the spirit or it comes to knowledge and Revelation and wisdom and understanding or teaching on certain things and whether it be Church order and other things it's all that the Lord's speaking from his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding these are things that we ought to seek after because by accepting him we become anointed the sermon here you him brother B's talking about the misuse of gifts he says we saw misuse these things just letting it go freelance that could break out into a series on freelancing we got too many people trying to Freestyle with the message we misuse these things just let to go freelance that's just as good as the devil would want to that's right if them gifts had been set in order and put in its place it takes teaching we know to do that those gifts have been set in order and put in place there' have been a Revival sweep this land today that's never been exceeded now this comes back to the statement we read a couple Services ever present water from the rock similar statement we don't lack power we lack knowledge that's an interesting way of putting it we don't lack power we lack knowledge we lack Faith because Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of the Lord and the word of the Lord brings knowledge and understanding with the word of the Lord comes knowledge comes understanding he says we don't lack power we lack knowledge we lack Faith you've got power any man that's born again has the whole Heavens open to him think of that if you're born again all of Heaven's available to you if you're born again if you have the Holy Ghost down on the inside of you all of Heaven is available to you but the reason why you can't tap into the potential of it isn't because you don't have the power to it it's because you don't have the knowledge to access it you don't have the faith to access it just like if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got enough power to go create a world and live on it but it operates by the law of faith brother man says how can you have faith if you don't know and so Paul prays this for the believer in Colossians chap 1: 9 and 10 I'm not going to be satisfied there just going to be something left I just want to read the scripture because then I have a very long quote I want to read to end on he says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding this was Paul's prayer this is at the core of Christ is the mystery God revealed was brother Brown brings it bringing it out of Colossians the teachings in Colossians that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding did Brother Brown preach the same gospel Paul preached I believe he prayed the same prayer for the elect that we'd be filled to the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord un all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God God Amen to be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding is how we walk worthy of the Lord into all pleasing this is how we're fruitful in every good work and as we do so he said increasing in the knowledge of God this is no just this is not just a onetime thing this is yeah I read the seals book when it came out haven't picked it up since this is yeah I listened to the church age book once an audio book it was good I one of my sons was telling me about a brother who said he was listening to some the Supernatural series and it was being narrated by somebody had a soothing voice so that's what he listened to to go to sleep and I'm always very careful to not let the messages become background music but there's there's something that you're not just saying wow what one time I learned it yeah I heard it one time but you're increasing in the knowledge of God listen when we pick this Bible up and read it and we should be able to read John 3:16 and be like OHA oh yeah no matter how many times we read it just to know there's depth to this that that as I will give into it this this there's a gravity this is water this word is water this word is a flood this word is coming down out of heaven and it's going to take the path of least resistance and so I want I want gravity to have its way I just want it to pour out and if there's a part of me that's been stubborn and it hasn't quite accepted this Revelation there's more depth for it to just come and to come deeper and to come deeper and I believe it can do that to increase in the knowledge of God because he says to any man that's been born again the whole Heaven's open to him that's amazing brother talks about how that where there's so many people accept substitutes he says when the Pentecostal skies are full of the real genuine article so there's a Heavens are full the there's a even if we could say it's bound up floods from Heaven it wants to open open up the windows of Heaven pour out a blessing the heavens are full of this flood that just wants to flow down but yet so many times we just accept substitutes and he says in the message thirst he says why would we want to take a substitute when there's a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies every fiber and longing in the human soul now if I could as we read through this he's going to use an example and now there is a there is a satisfi satisfaction that comes when you receive the Holy Ghost amen I'll amen it there's a satisfaction that comes but there's also a longing that comes with it there's absolutely a satisfaction that comes with the Holy Ghost but there's also a longing and when you read this that there's a holy ghost that satisfies every fiber and longing in the human soul that just as much as it has satisfied that thirst in the soul for life then even you everything that you long for everything that you're craving you can find an answer in Christ so then stand right in the face of death like the great Apostle Paul said oh death where's your stain grave where is your Victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ that's the experience breth that satisfies that Holy hush that Holy thirst that's in you it satisfies it you don't have to do anything else about it yay he says yeah it cleanses the lips there is also just people who live upon the emotion some people say well we got a lot of that in our Pentecostal movement and they'll go in which is fine and they'll pat their hands and play the music music stopped shoo a bucket of water went over everything now we do that we got in the habit of doing that it just becomes one of our customs let me tell you something when you're worshiping God in the spirit and the truth when it becomes a custom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor is going to think you're backslid you're drinking from a stagnated string now notice just how much it changes when it comes to your mindset what you're thinking what influence you're under if you're doing it because you're afraid you're going to be go to hell you're afraid not going to have it if you don't then there's the wrong kind of influence and so he's actually being very precise here he's not throwing out shouting he's not throwing out dancing he's not throwing out music he sh that there's a certain way that can corrupt the mindset and people get in the custom of things and they've got a lot of emotion and it's gotten to this point to where it's only triggered by certain things and you have this idea well if I don't stand when everybody else stands if I don't clap when everybody else claps if I'm not shouting if I'm not moving around when everybody else does then I'm backslid he says you're in the wrong flood you're in a stag You're Something stagnant it's not flowing it's not moving it's polluted he says right till it fills every fiber till the Holy Spirit itself bubbling in you I don't care whether the music is playing whether they're playing near my God to thee or whatever it is the holy spirit is still ringing the glory bells in your heart that satisfies that's God's P satisfying portion anything less than that you're done that's God's satisfying portion says you might speak with tongue like men and angels you might give all your goods to feed the poor you might prophesy you might have knowledge understand all the Mysteries and all and all these things and you will still become nothing 1 Corinthians 13 until that satisfying something that can only quench that thirst that's a statement what Paul says paradoxical statement but there has to be that satisfying something in the soul and he brings it back to his text my soul thirsts for the Living God like the heart panting for the water book unless I can find it I'll perish if you cry after knowledge lift up thy voice for understanding incline thy ear into wisdom apply thy heart to understanding seek for it search for it he wants somebody that can see it that they can let the word word let the word go through them let the current flow freely when you get to hungering for God like that something is going to take place the holy spirit is to lead you to those great Fountains of God it's what it's for there for the Holy Spirit to lead you to those great fountains yes sir now there's a there's a good thing to Worship in the spirit that's true but sometimes you have Spirit without truth St John 4 we worship God spirit and Truth Jesus is the truth that's exactly right and he is the word I believe that we should have a hunger for the word amen crave for it listen to it amen I hear from different ones who do devotions with their families they take time to share things out of the word of God with their family from the message of the hour from the Bible that's one of the best things you could do as a family amen is gather around the word one the best things we can do for ourselves in time of trouble is to get closer to that the word of God Amen feed our souls with the word of God listen to it hear it and as we hopefully I just put some of these things before you for you to chew on and to think about before we go further in this the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord what God does to the Earth to redeem it he does to the individual and if through the process of redemption this process of redemption if we had in our minds that in that process there's a point at which the knowledge of the Lord is going to fill up the Earth that I believe that we could have a desire that we could be full of the knowledge of the Lord amen let's make it a prayer tonight as we stand together
