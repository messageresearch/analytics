[0:00] Deuteronomy chapter
[0:02] 32:es 7-
[0:04] 11. Remember the days of old. Consider
[0:08] the years of many generations. Ask thy
[0:10] father and he will show thee thy elders
[0:13] and they will tell thee. When the most
[0:15] high divided to the nations their
[0:17] inheritance. When he separated the sons
[0:19] of Adam, he set bounds of the people
[0:21] according to the number of the children
[0:22] of Israel. For the Lord's portion is his
[0:24] people. Jacob is the lot of his
[0:27] inheritance. And so the he here that he
[0:29] speaks of in these next verses uh and
[0:32] the he and him is Jacob or Israel. He
[0:34] found him in a desert land and in the
[0:36] waste howling wilderness. He led him
[0:39] about he instructed him. He kept him as
[0:41] the apple of his eye and think of a
[0:44] child or a son because he says as an
[0:46] eagle stereth up her nest flutth over
[0:49] her young spreadth abroad her wings
[0:51] taketh them beareth them on her wings.
[0:55] So the Lord did alone lead him and there
[0:57] was no strange God with him. Amen. Let's
[1:01] just pray again. Heavenly Father, as we
[1:03] read these words, there's so much that's
[1:05] meant in this even in this moment that
[1:07] it was written to recall to mind what
[1:10] you had done and what had previously
[1:12] been done and how you were watching
[1:14] over, brooding over Israel as if it was
[1:17] your own son, your own child. Lord, how
[1:20] it was being instructive then and how we
[1:22] could look now see your plan. and we
[1:24] pray that you'd make these words alive
[1:25] to us today. Encourage us, Lord, by your
[1:28] word. And we ask this in the name of
[1:29] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You can have
[1:32] your seats. My title is uh the heart of
[1:36] a witness. The heart of a witness. We
[1:38] ministered on the art of witnessing last
[1:41] Sunday. And so we'll pick up on this
[1:43] here in Matthew chapter 5:16.
[1:46] He's speaking of a city set on a hill
[1:49] and a light of the candle being placed
[1:51] on a candlestick so that it can give
[1:53] light. And Jesus uses those two examples
[1:56] to say, "Let your light so shine before
[1:59] men. Let it shine like a city on a hill
[2:01] that can be seen like a candlestick
[2:03] positionally placed a candle
[2:05] positionally placed on a candlestick to
[2:07] give light to those in a darkened room.
[2:09] He says, "Let your light so shine before
[2:11] men that they may see your good works
[2:14] and glorify your father which is in
[2:16] heaven. I believe that you are now light
[2:20] in the Lord and that in a dark and dying
[2:22] age and in the darkest age there's ever
[2:24] been, there are lights that are living
[2:26] on earth now and the bride is the
[2:28] world's light. You are emanating truth.
[2:31] You are uh emanating goodness and
[2:33] righteousness and that is what your
[2:34] table is today to shed the light of God
[2:37] and to uh broadcast his character
[2:39] through the fruits of the spirit and
[2:42] this is a radiance that is meant to lead
[2:44] others to Christ and not people to you.
[2:48] So if we have light and if we are
[2:49] shining people are not drawn you're not
[2:52] merely drawn to the light of the city
[2:54] but you're drawn to what the lights
[2:56] represent and what they express. the
[2:58] same for a candle in a darkened room.
[3:00] Everyone just doesn't gather around the
[3:02] light looking at it. That's what
[3:03] campfires are for. But the the light is
[3:06] used for very specific purposes and for
[3:08] to give light to those that are within
[3:10] the house. In Colossians 4:5, it says,
[3:14] "Walk in wisdom towards them that are
[3:16] without redeeming the time, your
[3:19] character, your conduct, your decisions,
[3:21] your abstinence, all those things that
[3:23] we could speak of in terms of your
[3:25] attributes and your behavior and
[3:27] conduct. Even the things you say as a
[3:29] Christian are meant for the benefit of
[3:31] others and specifically them that do not
[3:34] believe. were doing these things for
[3:36] those who believe not who have not heard
[3:39] the truth so that they could know the
[3:41] truth. That's what we were using in the
[3:43] thought of the art of witnessing. It's
[3:46] that skill in testifying. It's that
[3:48] ability to uh demonstrate the character
[3:51] of Christ or demonstrate truth for the
[3:53] benefit of someone else. And so we know
[3:57] then as we kind of summarize the art of
[3:58] witnessing, that skill in testifying,
[4:01] it's that it's the purpose of witnessing
[4:03] is so that others can partake in the
[4:06] truth of Christ. Now, on the subject of
[4:08] the heart of a witness, I so I want to
[4:10] build off of that that your light is for
[4:12] the benefit of others. And that you are
[4:14] a witness. Uh not so much in that we're
[4:17] passing out tracks, uh handing out
[4:19] Bibles, but in that we're living the
[4:21] word of God. and we're looking for
[4:22] opportunities to express his nature and
[4:24] his character and the the looking at the
[4:26] thought of how can we uh be better
[4:29] witnesses. I want to look at what the
[4:31] heart that is required for a witness and
[4:34] my my thought uh centers a lot around uh
[4:38] uh um having feeling and real genuine
[4:41] sentiment for uh people. And this
[4:44] statement that Van Gogh had wrote to his
[4:48] uh brother uh Theo Theo and he had was
[4:52] writing this letter and in it he
[4:54] expressed to him how that uh he felt
[4:56] that Theo was really really kind to
[4:58] painters and not a lot of people
[4:59] expressed uh sim similar sentiments to
[5:01] painters and I don't know is the
[5:03] slideshow uh locked up or froze up there
[5:05] or I I don't know what's happening at
[5:07] this moment. So I thought maybe I had
[5:09] done something wrong. But uh he makes
[5:11] this statement. He writes this. He said,
[5:13] "I feel that there's nothing more
[5:15] genuinely artistic than to love people."
[5:18] And I thought that it was this statement
[5:20] that I read sometime last year that
[5:21] really struck me and I began to think
[5:23] about this morning. I think it was one
[5:24] of the things that led me to down this
[5:26] path of seeing how these parallels of
[5:28] art and the things of God. And that
[5:30] self-portrait there is not of brother
[5:32] Reginald Ben David Platt. That is
[5:34] actually Van Gogh who painted himself
[5:37] wore in the the character he almost
[5:39] looks Asian a little bit and he was
[5:40] being influenced by a Japanese artist
[5:42] but this was a self-portrait he painted
[5:44] around the time that he wrote this
[5:45] letter and he said I feel there's
[5:46] nothing more genuinely artistic than to
[5:49] love people. I really want you to think
[5:51] about that uh his sentiments may have
[5:54] been born from a lot of different things
[5:55] and it might have been influenced from
[5:57] different places but as we'll find in
[5:59] this scripture that there's something
[6:00] very powerful and something very
[6:03] necessary about having love in our
[6:04] hearts for people. And so that's my
[6:08] inspiration for this title the heart of
[6:10] a witness. Now in Proverbsap 14 25 it
[6:13] says a true witness delivereth souls but
[6:17] a deceitful witness speaketh lies. The
[6:20] word here that's used witness in the
[6:22] Hebrew it's testimony or the evidence of
[6:24] things. In one sense we could say that
[6:26] itself is a witness is a testimony. Uh
[6:30] uh witness in terms of the noun not the
[6:32] personal uh person but an evidence of
[6:35] things. It's that attestation from
[6:37] personal knowledge. You've seen it for
[6:38] yourself. Uh so you can witness
[6:40] something. It's from knowledge or wit.
[6:43] When we say witness it's from having
[6:44] knowledge or wit. A witness is one who
[6:47] testifies. So if you a witness can be a
[6:50] thing that is uh the evidence of things
[6:52] from knowledge or wit or the witness
[6:54] itself we say a witness on the stand
[6:56] would be one who testifies and actually
[6:58] the Greek word for witness is martyr and
[7:01] you think immediately is brother Aaron
[7:03] wanting to is he leading us to the punch
[7:04] or you we all wear Adidas jumpsuits and
[7:07] take some sleeping pills but to be a
[7:09] martyr is literally to be a witness.
[7:12] It's one who tears who bears testimony
[7:15] of their faith. And so the word martyr
[7:17] was used of those who gave their lives
[7:19] because they were willing to hold to
[7:20] their faith and give witness of their
[7:22] faith to death. And so that's what's
[7:24] meant by this. A true witness is one who
[7:26] can testify, one who bears a testimony.
[7:29] And if one is a witness or if you use it
[7:32] as a verb to witness something, then not
[7:34] only do you bear testimony or give
[7:36] testimony, but it means to see or to
[7:38] know by personal
[7:40] presence, something that you have
[7:42] actually observed. So here the Bible
[7:44] says a true witness delivers souls. It's
[7:47] one who can personally attest to a fact
[7:49] or event. They have personal knowledge
[7:51] of the veracity. They witness. They are
[7:53] a witness of truth. Something seen,
[7:56] something understood, something. They're
[7:58] not just saying, "Oh, well, something
[7:59] happened. Can you testify what happened
[8:01] on the morning of such and such and such
[8:03] and such?" Say, "Well, I can't tell you
[8:04] what happened. I just know that
[8:06] something happened." That's not a true
[8:08] witness. It's some personal knowledge.
[8:11] in 2 Samuel chapter
[8:13] 18 19-32 as we just read this story I
[8:17] think it'll convey everything that we
[8:19] need uh uh to or just this point I'm
[8:22] trying to make about what a true witness
[8:24] is says then said Aimaz and this is
[8:26] after Abselum had been killed the son of
[8:29] Zadok let me now run and bear the king
[8:32] tidings how that the Lord hath avenged
[8:34] him of his enemies and so he sees that
[8:36] the battle has been won aim has he says
[8:39] let me be the bear of news. Let me be a
[8:42] witness to King David, the fact that
[8:44] those who have opposed him are defeated.
[8:47] And Joab said unto him, "Thou shalt not
[8:49] bear tidings this day, but thou shalt
[8:51] bear tidings another day." He's saying,
[8:53] "No, you're not to run to the king and
[8:55] give tidings." He says, "But this day
[8:58] thou shalt bear no tidings because the
[9:00] king's son is dead." And it's said
[9:03] because what Aimaz knows is that the
[9:05] battle's been won. But what he doesn't
[9:07] know in particular is what had happened
[9:09] to the king's son. So there was very
[9:11] specific news that Joab wanted to reach
[9:14] the king because he knew what would be
[9:15] in the king's heart, what he would want
[9:17] to hear. Then Joab said to Kushi, "Go
[9:19] tell the king what thou hast seen."
[9:21] Notice he doesn't tell him what to say.
[9:24] Doesn't tell him in particular what it
[9:25] is, but it was something that Kushi
[9:27] could personally testify to. So we're
[9:29] going to use him as an example of a true
[9:33] witness. Tell him what you have seen.
[9:34] This is what it means to be a true
[9:36] witness. And Kushi bowed himself into
[9:38] Joab and ran. Then said Aimaz the son of
[9:41] Zadok yet again to Joab. But howsoever
[9:44] let me I pray thee also run after Kushi.
[9:47] Notice the desire the zeal. I want to do
[9:49] something. I I want to express
[9:50] something. I want to do something. He
[9:52] says and Joab said, "Wherefore wil thou
[9:55] run, my son, seeing that thou hast no
[9:58] tidings ready?" What what are you
[10:00] witnessing? What are you going to
[10:02] express? What is going to be meant by
[10:03] your running, by your activity, by all
[10:05] that you're doing? But howsoever said
[10:08] he, let me run. So he still wants to
[10:10] run. He says, what do you what's your
[10:12] voice? What are you gonna say? What are
[10:14] you gonna share? And he says, but let me
[10:15] run. He said, run. I want us to think
[10:17] about this. You may want to run. You may
[10:19] want to do a lot of stuff and God's
[10:21] going to let you run. But what is it
[10:23] you're witnessing? What is it you're
[10:24] pointing to? What is it you know by
[10:26] personal experience and personal
[10:27] knowledge that you're declaring? He
[10:28] said, "Go ahead, run." Then Amaz ran by
[10:31] the way of the plane and overran Kushi.
[10:33] So he's going to be the first one there.
[10:35] David sat between the two gates and he's
[10:37] waiting. He's anxious about the results.
[10:39] And the watchman went up to the roof of
[10:41] the gate over the wall and lifted up his
[10:43] eyes and looked and behold a man running
[10:45] alone. And the watchman cried and told
[10:48] the king. And the king said, "If he be
[10:49] alone, there's tidings in his mouth." So
[10:51] he knew this was a messenger. And he
[10:53] came a pace and drew near. And the
[10:55] watchman saw another man running. And
[10:57] the watchman called into the porter and
[10:58] said, "Behold, another man running
[11:00] alone." And the king said, "He also
[11:02] bringeth tidings." I thought this one
[11:04] was interesting. He said, ' And the
[11:06] watchman said, 'Me thinkketh the running
[11:07] of the foremost is like the running of a
[11:09] Hemon, the son of Zadok. He might have
[11:11] had a really unique way of running or
[11:12] something. He said, I know who that is.
[11:15] And the king said, he is a good man and
[11:17] cometh with good tidings. So, it's not
[11:20] that he was uh evil or had wrong intent,
[11:23] but he's in his desire to serve and his
[11:26] uh use as a messenger, he David assumed
[11:30] this one is going to witness. He's
[11:31] witnessed something. He's going to bring
[11:32] these tidings. And Ahemos called and
[11:34] said unto the king, "All is well." And
[11:37] he fell down to the earth upon his face
[11:38] before the king, and said, "Blessed be
[11:40] the Lord thy God, which hath delivered
[11:42] up the men that lifted up their hand
[11:43] against my lord the king." So he could
[11:45] testify to the results of the battle.
[11:48] Let me go tell that you've been avenged
[11:49] of your enemies. And the king said, "Is
[11:52] the young man Abselum safe?" I want you
[11:56] to catch this too about the heart of a
[11:58] father. He knew uh this battle was
[12:02] taking place. He knew they had uh come
[12:04] up against him. And he asked him what he
[12:06] he had something very specific he wanted
[12:08] to know. He wasn't didn't worry wasn't
[12:10] worried about the battle. He wanted to
[12:11] know about his son. And Aimez answered,
[12:13] "When Joab sent the king's servant and
[12:15] me thy servant, I saw a great tom. I saw
[12:18] a great battle. I saw something
[12:19] happening, but I knew not what it was."
[12:22] And this is why Joab turned to Kushi and
[12:24] he said, "Go tell him what you've seen."
[12:26] Ahimas knew something had happened, but
[12:28] he didn't have personal knowledge of in
[12:30] particular what had transpired. And he
[12:31] knew that Kushi knew something. So he
[12:34] said, "We've been sent, me and his other
[12:35] servant have been sent a and uh to to
[12:40] share these things, but I don't know
[12:42] exactly what happened beyond there's
[12:44] been a victory." The king said to him,
[12:45] "Turn aside and stand there." And he
[12:47] turned aside and stood still. David knew
[12:49] that there was another messenger yet
[12:50] coming. Behold, Kushi came. And Kushi
[12:53] said, "Tidings, my lord, the king, for
[12:55] the Lord hath avenged thee this day of
[12:57] all them that rose up against thee." The
[12:59] same tidings in particular that he had.
[13:03] And then the king said unto Kushi, "Is
[13:04] the young man Abselum saved?" The same
[13:07] sentence. What is this again? This is
[13:09] the heart of a father. And we'll read
[13:11] here, you could read here in a moment. I
[13:13] I took these verses out actually where
[13:14] David when he learns that Abselon is
[13:16] dead weeps, laments, and he's deeply
[13:20] wounded because as a father, even though
[13:22] his son had risen up against him, his
[13:24] love for him had never changed. He
[13:26] didn't wish him ill. He didn't want to
[13:27] banish him from the kingdom. Uh he it
[13:30] was very hard for him to see these
[13:31] things transpiring. And the king said
[13:33] unto Kushi, "Is my son safe?" And Kushi
[13:35] answered, "The enemies of my lord the
[13:38] king and all that rise against thee to
[13:39] do thee hurt be as that young man is."
[13:42] Kushi knew the result of that toml, that
[13:45] battle, that um engagement in which
[13:49] Abselum was dead and he could testify
[13:52] specifically to what had happened. Not
[13:54] just generally, but he had personal
[13:56] knowledge about the things relevant to
[13:58] the king. He had experienced it himself.
[14:00] And I want to use this scriptural
[14:02] example of what a true witness is.
[14:05] It's one that actually knows the truth,
[14:07] the truth of things as they actually
[14:09] are. In Proverbsap 14:5, it says, "A
[14:13] faithful witness will not lie, but a
[14:15] false witness will utter lies." It's a
[14:18] remarkable statement. I think we could
[14:19] all just agree that this is an accurate
[14:21] observation. A faithful witness will
[14:24] tell the truth, but a false witness will
[14:26] utter lies. This is at the heart of a
[14:29] witness. They have truth in their heart.
[14:31] Personal experience and knowledge of a
[14:32] thing that they want to testify to. So
[14:34] the heart of a witness is full of truth
[14:37] because life depends on truthtelling.
[14:41] Think of this for all of us as we
[14:42] measure our words and the things we do.
[14:44] Life depends upon truthtelling. Truth is
[14:47] the cement of society. If we're if it's
[14:50] uh if it's falsities and it's built on
[14:52] lies and suspicions, societyy's going to
[14:54] crumble. So it see uh truth cements
[14:57] society together. But yet a deceitful
[15:00] witness obscures truth. Why? Because
[15:03] even to him it is obscured. A Hemos saw
[15:06] a battle and he saw tomalt. He saw
[15:08] something happened and so he could
[15:10] observe a happening but yet it's
[15:12] obscured to him. Therefore, if he tried
[15:15] to say specifically what had happened,
[15:17] he would have been an unfaithful or
[15:19] deceitful witness because the truth
[15:20] being obscured to him, he obscures truth
[15:23] the more that he tries to witness. A
[15:26] deceitful witness will give false
[15:27] evidence. One translation said, "A
[15:29] deceitful witness is a cheat." I think
[15:32] we all like that one. He's a cheat.
[15:34] That's what he is. And so, if we're
[15:36] going to be a witness, our hearts must
[15:39] be convinced of the truth of a thing.
[15:42] There must be deep conviction and and a
[15:45] certainty. It can't just be, well, I
[15:47] think so, or I'm not sure. And if we
[15:49] aren't sure, it's okay to say we don't
[15:52] know. If there isn't certainty, it's
[15:54] okay to say that there is no certainty.
[15:56] But if you're going so if you're going
[15:57] to stand and present yourself as
[16:00] testifying or demonstrating something to
[16:02] be true, you want that truth to be in
[16:04] your heart, you want to know that you
[16:05] know that you know.
[16:07] Van Go in one of these letters to his
[16:09] brother said, "Faith in God is for me a
[16:12] certainty, not some notion, not an idol
[16:17] belief." I don't know if I can control
[16:19] this from here said
[16:21] not not some notion, not an idol belief.
[16:25] It is so. It is true. There is a God
[16:28] that lives. A God that's alive in you
[16:30] and I. A God that's been real throughout
[16:32] history. And so there if we're going to
[16:35] be a witness, if we're going to declare
[16:37] something to be true, there has to be a
[16:39] certainty in our hearts, we have to know
[16:42] that what we're speaking about is true.
[16:45] And in the light of the fact that we
[16:46] could be a deceitful witness who utters
[16:49] lies and falsehoods and it be to
[16:50] someone's detriment, let us remember
[16:52] even the example of Hemos who so
[16:55] desperately wanted to run and there's a
[16:56] caution there. What do you what's your
[16:58] voice? What's your witness? When
[16:59] pressed, he wasn't he didn't
[17:02] speculate. He testified to what he knew
[17:04] was true and he left the rest to the one
[17:07] who had the rest of the
[17:09] information. in Zechariah 8 16-1
[17:13] 17 said these are the things that ye
[17:16] shall do you want didn't you pray Lord
[17:19] tell me what can I do some of you
[17:21] seeking the will of the Lord I want to
[17:22] know what I need to do speak ye every
[17:24] man the truth to his neighbor here's a
[17:27] real key to this if the nothing truly
[17:29] more artistic than loving people to love
[17:32] people and there's something about God
[17:34] that is described and summed up as God
[17:37] is love and God being the ultimate
[17:39] creator and the ultimate hardest. We see
[17:41] that parallel. Speak ye every man the
[17:43] truth to his neighbor. Execute the
[17:46] judgment of truth and peace in your
[17:48] gates. And let none of you imagine evil
[17:51] in your hearts against his neighbor. And
[17:53] love no false oath. For all these are
[17:56] things that I hate, sayaeth the Lord.
[17:58] He's not saying he hates his
[18:00] neighbor. He's saying he hates an
[18:03] imagine imagining evil in your hearts
[18:05] against your neighbor.
[18:07] doesn't say that he hates judgment of
[18:08] truth and peace in your hearts. He hates
[18:10] the opposite of those things. So speak
[18:13] every man the truth to your neighbor.
[18:15] Don't lie. Don't cheat. Don't
[18:17] defraud. But in the sense that I
[18:20] wouldn't want to say anything that would
[18:21] harm, speak those things which edify.
[18:24] Speak and say things that promote
[18:26] goodness. Speak ye every man the truth
[18:28] to your neighbor. Execute justice and
[18:31] judgment. Do that is right, the judgment
[18:32] of truth and peace in your gates. not
[18:35] trying to stir things up and strife and
[18:38] instigating everyone. It there was a
[18:41] time when the trolls were relegated to
[18:44] forums online that none of us would
[18:46] never visit. But now the trolls are
[18:47] everywhere. And what are they trying to
[18:49] do? Trying to instigate, stir things up,
[18:51] cause strife. Let none of you imagine
[18:54] evil in your hearts against your
[18:56] neighbor. And love no false oath,
[19:00] deceitful
[19:01] testimonies, but a true witness. As
[19:04] we've already read in the scripture in
[19:06] verse 25 of Proverbs 14, he a true
[19:10] witness delivereth souls. He delivers
[19:13] the
[19:14] innocent. He delivers the falsely
[19:16] accused. That means to rescue or to
[19:18] save. Deliver means to recover. So a
[19:21] true witness has something at heart that
[19:24] he wants to speak the truth because
[19:26] there's something at stake.
[19:30] a regardless of what else is taking
[19:32] place, he realized this is one that's
[19:34] under this sentence or this
[19:35] pronouncement or they're at the risk of
[19:37] being accused. And so in the even the
[19:39] context that a true witness will deliver
[19:42] a soul who's been falsely accused, who
[19:44] faces severe punishment, he's willing to
[19:47] speak truth to rescue and recover that
[19:50] one. And let me put it this way.
[19:52] Christian character is willing to risk
[19:55] unpopularity, willing to risk the mob or
[19:58] being cancelled to speak truth and
[20:00] rescue those who are bound by lies. In
[20:03] this time where there's this spiral of
[20:05] silence and the there's so much bullying
[20:07] that takes place and people just want to
[20:09] shut up and not say anything. I don't
[20:11] believe that we should join the counter
[20:13] mob that tries to be the bully to the
[20:15] bully or tries to be this voice that
[20:17] opposes the insanity to the other side.
[20:19] But we must have this willingness to
[20:21] riskmen
[20:23] the the favor of others and to risk the
[20:25] influence of great people to speak truth
[20:28] for those who stand bound to
[20:33] lies. This Proverbs chapter 14 was very
[20:36] instructive to me as I studied it.
[20:38] Proverbs 14 21. He that despiseth his
[20:41] neighbor
[20:42] sinnth. Now we talk a lot about the
[20:44] neighbor in the apartment next door.
[20:46] Hope we've learned to love him. We do
[20:49] love them because they're the ones we
[20:50] say this is all for. He's given us an
[20:53] out. But he says, "He that despiseth his
[20:55] neighbor sinnth." All right. You don't
[20:57] have to make eye contact with me, but
[20:58] how many of you have one of those
[21:00] neighbors that you just
[21:02] resent, right? I was going to say they
[21:04] park in front of your mailbox, but we
[21:06] really don't have mailboxes in Phoenix.
[21:08] They park where you don't want them to
[21:09] park. They do things you don't want them
[21:11] to do. It says the says he that
[21:12] despiseth. Amen. It's this attitude of
[21:15] disdain, this
[21:17] contempt such that there really is no
[21:19] concern for him. Whether you are so
[21:21] embittered against them and bitter
[21:23] towards them that you don't care or the
[21:25] disdain is this lack of empathy and
[21:28] concern whatsoever. He that despiseth
[21:30] his neighbor is sins, but he that hath
[21:33] mercy on the poor, happy is he.
[21:36] The Bible speaks to this principle that
[21:38] our character is measured by our
[21:41] attitude and treatment to those who are
[21:43] less fortunate than us and those who are
[21:45] weaker than us. Our attitude towards
[21:48] those who aren't as educated, who don't
[21:50] know as much, who don't haven't
[21:52] accomplished the things that we have
[21:53] accomplished. They seem to be very
[21:55] different than us. Characters measured
[21:56] by our conduct towards the marginalized,
[21:59] the weak, or even the less fortunate.
[22:02] Because when it says, "He that despiseth
[22:03] his neighbor sinnth," it says in
[22:06] Proverbs 14:20, "The poor is hated even
[22:08] of his own neighbor." So these verses
[22:10] need to be taken together. That when you
[22:13] have a poor neighbor and you have a
[22:14] neighbor that doesn't know as much as
[22:16] you, you have a neighbor that's not as
[22:17] spiritual as you, a neighbor that's
[22:18] religious, this or this or that or
[22:20] different, it says if they're poor, if
[22:22] they're if they're not like you, they're
[22:25] hated. There's something you don't want
[22:27] to be. They're hated of his own
[22:29] neighbor. But the rich hath many
[22:31] friends, the rich neighbor, you you want
[22:34] to be like him, right? You want to be
[22:36] That's why a man that wants to have a
[22:38] lot of friends has got to really spread
[22:40] himself out really thin and he's got to
[22:42] show himself friendly. And I say the
[22:44] rich can find friends rather easily.
[22:47] But the poor is hated by even his
[22:49] neighbor. To be despised, it means to
[22:52] look down upon, to think it below you,
[22:54] to take notice, or to be concerned with
[22:56] him.
[22:58] He that looks down upon his neighbor
[23:01] doesn't take notice or doesn't even feel
[23:03] it's worth being concerned for him, he
[23:07] sinnth. But the true witness delivers
[23:11] souls. At the heart of a true witness,
[23:14] there's I believe there's redemption at
[23:18] heart. So there's a conviction first in
[23:22] your heart of truth. If we even say here
[23:25] that as the neighbor to the poor, you
[23:29] would have some understanding that they
[23:31] are in fact poor and there's some
[23:32] certainty that they're destitute of
[23:34] something that they're lacking and they
[23:36] need something and that perhaps there's
[23:37] a way that you could help them. There
[23:39] has to be a conviction of truth and an
[23:43] understanding of the
[23:46] consequence. So there's a conviction of
[23:48] truth. This is the truth. And in light
[23:51] of truth, there's severe consequences
[23:53] for those that don't have truth.
[23:55] Therefore, you're
[23:57] concerned. John 1:es
[24:00] 35-42. Kind of jumping right into the
[24:03] middle of this. I think it fits well
[24:04] with Wednesday night's sermon. Says,
[24:06] "Again, the next day after John stood
[24:09] and two of his
[24:10] disciples, and looking upon Jesus as he
[24:13] walked, he saith, behold the lamb of
[24:15] God. This is the ministry of the spirit
[24:18] of Elijah. This is John the Baptist
[24:20] fuller running the first coming. And
[24:21] what he says is, "Behold the lamb of
[24:24] God." And this is verse 37 that we all
[24:26] must take heed to. And the two disciples
[24:30] heard him speak and they followed
[24:34] Jesus. What if? Could it be? What if?
[24:39] Right. Could it be that there has been a
[24:42] declaration, behold the lamb of God, and
[24:45] some people are just still following
[24:46] John the Baptist? But those that heard
[24:50] him speak were convinced of the truth of
[24:53] his testimony, his witness. They
[24:55] followed Jesus.
[24:57] So now they are following Christ. And
[24:59] Jesus turned and saw them following and
[25:01] saith, "What seek ye? Why are you
[25:04] following me?" They said unto him,
[25:05] "Rabbi," which is to say, "Be an
[25:07] interpreted master. Where dwellest
[25:09] thou?" I want to know where does this
[25:11] guy live? I want to see his house, his
[25:15] neighborhood. Has he been on uh the
[25:18] lifestyles of the rich and famous? We
[25:19] want to
[25:21] see where he lives. He saith unto them,
[25:23] "Come and
[25:24] see." And they came and saw where he
[25:27] dwelt and abode with him that day. So
[25:29] they're tearing with him. They're
[25:31] journeying with him, for it was about
[25:32] the 10th
[25:33] hour. Now, if you follow this story,
[25:36] here's two disciples that are following
[25:39] the forerunner. The forerunner says,
[25:42] "Here's Christ." And they immediately
[25:45] start following him. They spend this
[25:46] time with him. They see who he is within
[25:48] his home, within his house. They abode
[25:49] with him. And verse 40, and one of the
[25:51] two which heard John speak and follow
[25:53] him was Andrew, Simon Peter's
[25:57] brother. Think, listen to this now.
[25:59] Verse 41, he knows this is the Messiah.
[26:02] and first findeth his own brother Simon,
[26:06] and saith unto him, we have found the
[26:08] Messiah, which is being interpreted the
[26:10] Christ, and he brought him to
[26:13] Jesus. This is Andrew being convinced
[26:16] that this is a Messiah. Andrew and Peter
[26:18] had followed the prophet for some time.
[26:20] They were disciples of John and they
[26:22] knew that John was leading them to
[26:24] something. And now when he was convinced
[26:26] that John's ministry had been fulfilled
[26:28] and had pointed him to this, he went and
[26:30] his first concern is for his brother who
[26:33] ought to know who would be the one to
[26:34] receive these things. He finds Peter and
[26:37] he says, "We found the anointed one. We
[26:40] have found the Christ." And he doesn't
[26:42] just tell him about him. He brings him
[26:43] to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he
[26:45] said, "Thou art Simon the son of Jonah.
[26:47] Thou shalt be called Cphus, which is by
[26:50] interpretation a stone.
[26:56] He was convinced of Christ and then he
[27:00] wanted to
[27:01] share his understanding, this witness
[27:04] with his brother. And brother Benham
[27:07] uses this scripture in the three
[27:09] different places that he ministers on
[27:10] the thought convinced and then concerned
[27:12] and convinced then concerned. He says,
[27:15] "It's our duty the pe to the people
[27:18] really to tell the truth. It's our duty
[27:21] to tell the
[27:22] truth because you're going to meet it
[27:25] again. We have a duty to tell the truth
[27:28] because we're going to meet it again.
[27:29] And we have a duty to tell the truth
[27:30] because others are going to have to meet
[27:32] that. He says, "This is just a little
[27:34] stay." I like how he describes our time
[27:35] on earth. Just a little stay. That's
[27:38] eternal there. Let's stay with it. Tell
[27:41] the truth and be truthful about it.
[27:45] There's a challenge. A lot of times we
[27:47] tell the truth, but we are just really
[27:49] careful in the way that we share it
[27:51] because we want to be able to use that
[27:52] truth for our own advantage. And we have
[27:55] to be careful to be a true witness that
[27:57] we're not deceitful even with truth. He
[27:59] says, "Tell the truth and be truthful
[28:01] about it." Yes. Concerned. First, before
[28:05] you get concerned, you have to be
[28:06] convinced you are right. Then when you
[28:09] are convinced that God is right, please
[28:11] just follow this. When you're convinced
[28:12] that God is right and God is in you and
[28:14] God did such great things for you, then
[28:16] you are sure. Reminds me of the
[28:19] wonderful sermon Brother Eleer
[28:21] ministered on what it really means to be
[28:23] blessed. And that that that distinction
[28:26] between blessings, which we could all
[28:28] experience. And as I listen to it, my
[28:31] wife listened to we listen to it
[28:32] together, we realize that we could
[28:35] almost get to where it's like we say so
[28:37] often how blessed we are by the things
[28:39] that God gives us. And we were we're
[28:42] it's true to call those things
[28:43] blessings, but what how are we truly
[28:46] blessed? Because God is in us. Amen. And
[28:50] him being in us, blessed be the name of
[28:51] the Lord. When he gives blessings and
[28:53] takes them away, we can say they're both
[28:55] blessings. God gives us something. Oh,
[28:58] that's a wonderful blessing. He takes it
[28:59] away and says, "That's a wonderful
[29:03] blessing." But we're blessed. God is in
[29:06] you. Done great things for you. And
[29:08] you're sure, you're certain.
[29:11] You see your brother in error, you're
[29:13] going to tell him about it. If there
[29:15] isn't, then there's something wrong.
[29:18] There's a song uh it's very it's well
[29:21] written and it's very lyrical and it
[29:24] says you know I want to be like Jesus
[29:26] when he knocked over the tables and used
[29:28] a whip. I want to be like Jesus when he
[29:30] said the Pharisees were hypocrites. I
[29:33] want to be like Jesus when he w I want
[29:34] to be like Jesus when he's the life of
[29:35] the party turning water into wine.
[29:37] Right? And there all these ideas about
[29:39] Christ. And so we might read this like
[29:40] yeah I could stand in line to tell my
[29:43] brother he's wrong. Are both of them
[29:45] going to be there?
[29:47] But it's not in that kind of attitude,
[29:49] right?
[29:51] When you're convinced of the truth of
[29:53] something, then there has to be some
[29:55] understanding of the consequences. So,
[29:57] it's not like this. Well, I'm really
[29:59] going to show him he's ignorant and he's
[30:00] Pentecostal and he's Catholic and he's
[30:02] going to follow that Chicago style pope
[30:04] to the grave. No, there's this idea that
[30:06] there's something
[30:07] wrong and their soul is at stake
[30:12] and that if you don't want to share it
[30:13] with them, then there's something wrong
[30:15] with you. says, "That's the truth." He
[30:18] said, "If you see that the church is
[30:19] wrong, no matter you love the church,
[30:22] but he says Christ loved the church and
[30:24] he gave his life for
[30:26] it." There, this leads me to the
[30:28] scripture in John 15. So, hold tight to
[30:30] what he's saying here. Christ loved the
[30:32] church and gave his life for it. And
[30:34] we're supposed to do the same thing.
[30:36] Now, don't I'm still on this statement
[30:39] here and convinced them concerned. Says
[30:42] we're supposed to do the same thing. not
[30:44] only supposed to but we will if we got
[30:48] the love of Christ in us. Now your
[30:51] burden is not to give your life
[30:53] literally and say well I fulfilled the
[30:55] cause of Christ for my life. We ought to
[30:58] be willing to we ought to be willing to
[30:59] be martyrs but what is it that brother
[31:01] said? The deceitfulness of this age is
[31:03] that they won't take your life.
[31:06] The deceitfulness of this age is they
[31:07] would cause you to believe that you're
[31:09] doing good and you're doing evil.
[31:13] We're supposed to do the same thing. In
[31:15] other words, love to the point of
[31:17] sacrifice. Speak ye the truth to every
[31:20] man. In other words, we ought to have
[31:21] that kind of love in our hearts. We're
[31:22] willing to risk being unpopular to speak
[31:26] truth to risk the displeasure or even
[31:29] rejection out of love for the one who's
[31:32] in error. Not only are we supposed to do
[31:34] it, but we'll we will if we have the
[31:36] love of Christ. It constrains us, as the
[31:38] scripture says, he's quoting it. It
[31:40] constrains us and behooves us to do so
[31:42] as Christians. The love of Christ not
[31:45] only constrains us to keep us from
[31:47] acting out of turn, but it behooves us
[31:49] to act to provoke unto love and to good
[31:51] works and to speak on behalf or even
[31:54] live as an example for those who are in
[31:56] darkness. John 15:13, just as Christ
[31:59] loved the church and gave himself for
[32:01] it, greater love hath no man than this,
[32:03] that a man laid down his life for his
[32:06] friends.
[32:08] Greater love hath no man than this. This
[32:11] speaks to the greatest love which Christ
[32:13] had that he would lay down his life for
[32:15] his friends. But what about the love
[32:18] that Christ had for the church that
[32:19] brother Bam saying that we ought to have
[32:21] for one another and that we ought to
[32:22] have to where we're supposed to do the
[32:24] same thing if we have the love of Christ
[32:27] in us. Love is
[32:31] sacrificial. It takes it takes risk.
[32:37] I I often go back through when I'm the
[32:39] Lord's deal with me on a particular
[32:40] subject. I sometimes want to make sure
[32:42] there's not just an echo and I'm not
[32:44] just going back and revisiting things
[32:45] that have been ministered before and I
[32:47] so I'll go back and look at servant
[32:49] titles or notes from a series past and I
[32:51] realize there is a a cycle of themes. Uh
[32:55] and I think with each turn these things
[32:58] should be getting richer and and more
[33:01] first nature. And I don't tire of seeing
[33:04] them in the word of God. And I hope that
[33:05] you don't tire of hearing them because I
[33:07] believe these things are critical or
[33:09] essential to the change. This kind of
[33:12] character that Christ is trying to bring
[33:13] out of us in this hour. And so love is a
[33:16] cons one of those consistent cycles. But
[33:18] brother Bram says and convinced then
[33:20] concerned love is
[33:22] discipline. Can you see those paragraph
[33:24] numbers, brother Scott? Oh good, good.
[33:26] Was fellowshipping and he said he liked
[33:28] it when I included the whole t date and
[33:30] title and all everything because he
[33:32] could take better notes. I thought, man,
[33:34] how do I make everyone happy? And
[33:36] because some people say they like this.
[33:38] So, and I was like, I have enough room
[33:39] to put the date and the paragraph
[33:41] number. And so, I'm using the paragraph
[33:44] number from the table. If anyone's
[33:46] wanting to readily look that up, the
[33:48] table app, a little plug, maybe they'll
[33:50] let me in on some of the royalties.
[33:52] Little plug for the table app. Love is
[33:54] discipline. He says you must discipline
[33:57] people if you love them.
[33:59] And again, it's not like I want to be
[34:01] like Jesus when he braided the whip.
[34:03] It's not that you're going to exert
[34:05] dominance and you're going to prove that
[34:07] you're smarter than them. It has to be
[34:09] done in
[34:10] love. Love itself is
[34:13] disciplined. Love constrains us. Brother
[34:15] Bram says it constrains us. He refers to
[34:17] that scripture says it constrains us. So
[34:19] there is a certain uh rigor and hardship
[34:21] you're willing to endure and things
[34:23] you're willing to be restrained from.
[34:25] And it it love disciplines us, but then
[34:27] it also disciples. It wants to teach. It
[34:30] wants to share. The best teachers are
[34:32] the ones who love the subject matter
[34:35] that they're teaching. The best teachers
[34:37] are the ones that see it more than just
[34:38] a textbook and it's just academic and
[34:41] this is just something to do. You find
[34:42] somebody who's passionate about a
[34:43] subject matter. They don't even have to
[34:45] be degreed, but they'll be the best
[34:47] teacher because that's what love wants
[34:49] to do. It wants to teach. It wants to
[34:51] share. It says here that it will
[34:53] discipline. It'll teach
[34:58] disciples. What shall we do? Speak truth
[35:00] to every man to his neighbor and hold no
[35:02] evil thoughts in his heart towards his
[35:04] neighbor. Galatians 5
[35:07] 13-15. For brethren, you have been
[35:09] called unto liberty. Only use not
[35:12] liberty for an occasion to the flesh. I
[35:14] wonder how many have used this as the uh
[35:17] the witching wand to go to Liberty
[35:19] University.
[35:22] But don't use going to college as an
[35:24] occasion to the flesh. He says, "But by
[35:26] love, serve one another. We have
[35:30] liberty, but don't use this liberty to
[35:32] be self- serving." You have truth, but
[35:35] be truthful about it. You're a light,
[35:37] but not to gather moths to your flame.
[35:40] There's a reason why God has done this,
[35:42] and he's set you so, so that you can by
[35:44] love serve others.
[35:48] And then this phrase and is often
[35:51] visited in the New Testament. For all
[35:53] the laws fulfilled in one word, even
[35:55] this one saying, "Thou shalt love thy
[35:57] neighbor as
[35:58] thyself." The entire law hangs on this
[36:02] word, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[36:05] thyself." He that despises his neighbor
[36:09] sinnth. He that has mercy on the poor,
[36:11] his neighbor, those that are less
[36:12] fortunate, the poor is hated even of his
[36:14] own neighbor. But when it comes to a
[36:15] Christian, he won't hate his poor
[36:17] neighbor because he he's mercy on him.
[36:20] And the Bible says, "Happy is he who has
[36:23] mercy." Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[36:26] thyself. Why are you happy? Because
[36:28] you're doing the will of God. Thou shalt
[36:30] love thy neighbor as thyself. But if you
[36:32] bite and devour one another, take heed
[36:35] that you be not consumed one of another.
[36:38] Bite is evil
[36:39] speaking. How do you bite? It's not with
[36:42] literal teeth. Can't remember right now
[36:44] who it was. But I remember when Elliot
[36:46] was really really little, under like one
[36:48] years old or something like that. He
[36:49] went up to another little baby in the
[36:50] church and we're like, "Oh, that's so
[36:51] cute. He's giving him a kiss." And then
[36:53] he backs up and there teeth marks in the
[36:55] cheek. It's like that's a pretty
[36:56] aggressive kiss. But that's not it's not
[37:00] the physical biting. It's the words.
[37:02] Bite is evil speaking. A deceitful
[37:05] witness. Not speaking the truth every
[37:07] man to your neighbor. When we are not
[37:10] truthful, when we bite and devour,
[37:11] that's that railing, that clamor, that
[37:13] uh criticism, we're consumed. What are
[37:16] we consumed? By the lies and the
[37:18] contention. The phrase to bite and
[37:21] devour one another. Take heed that you
[37:22] be not consumed one another. It's an
[37:24] image of animals of prey attacking and
[37:27] devouring one another.
[37:30] It's a battle to the death, trying to
[37:32] get the advantage. You're out to kill
[37:34] me. I better kill you then.
[37:37] But now he's saying that you to love
[37:41] truth and if I could put it this way and
[37:43] love your neighbor by living
[37:46] truthfully. We have been given liberty
[37:49] to by love serve one
[37:51] another. So not only do we love truth,
[37:54] we're lovers of truth, but we also live
[37:57] truthfully. Have a heart of feeling and
[38:00] love. So what are these things? Love thy
[38:02] lord th Lord thy God with all thy heart
[38:04] and thy neighbor as thyself.
[38:12] As brother Vincent said, I feel that
[38:13] there's nothing more genuinely artistic
[38:15] than to love
[38:17] people. Something at the heart of
[38:21] God. Isaiah 1:7 says, "Learn to do
[38:26] well. Seek
[38:28] judgment. Relieve the
[38:31] oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead
[38:34] for the
[38:36] widow. We ask ourselves, what what does
[38:38] God want me to do? Speak truth every man
[38:41] to your neighbor. Learn to do well.
[38:44] Learn to do good. Seek judgment or
[38:48] justice. Relieve the oppressed. It means
[38:52] to correct the oppressed, the wicked,
[38:55] those who are in error. Correct it.
[38:57] Judge the fatherless. Take up the cause
[38:59] of the orphan. Defend the widow's
[39:01] rights. These are things that we're
[39:02] ought to we ought to do. Now, for those
[39:04] of you who are starting to think, is
[39:06] this one of those woke services? No,
[39:08] this is just biblical.
[39:11] Sometimes there's a scarecrow that gets
[39:12] lifted up and about socialism and and
[39:16] all sorts of things and there's issues
[39:18] over immigration and it just get
[39:21] everybody riled up. But, you know,
[39:23] there's a truth to the Bible that we're
[39:24] to seek justice,
[39:26] correct oppression, take up the cause of
[39:28] the orphan, defend the widow's rights.
[39:31] What we see today in the erosion of
[39:33] certain things and the battle over them
[39:34] and the solution to solve them is
[39:36] because Christ has been thrust out and
[39:38] it's left to political minds to try to
[39:41] deal with the fallout and they all have
[39:42] their ideas on how it should be done and
[39:44] they're all looking to serve themselves.
[39:48] But there is a a heart of the believer
[39:52] to do these things.
[39:54] Ephesians 4:32 says, "And be ye kind one
[39:58] to
[39:59] another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
[40:02] another, even as God for Christ's sake
[40:05] hath forgiven
[40:07] you." To be kind, to be merciful.
[40:11] Kindness is akin to mercy. It's a word
[40:13] that's often interchangeable. Have mercy
[40:15] towards one another. Be kind one to
[40:16] another, tenderhearted. It's a heart of
[40:18] feeling. You can be touched with when
[40:21] someone else is going through some
[40:23] something. You're not callous. You're
[40:25] not embitter. You don't despise your
[40:26] neighbor. We forgive one another as God
[40:28] has forgiven us. Peter says it in 1
[40:31] Peter 3:8. Finally, be you all of one
[40:33] mind, having compassion one of another,
[40:36] love as brethren, be merciful, be
[40:39] pitiful and courteous or
[40:41] considerate. These are instructions to
[40:44] us as Holy Spiritfilled believers. I
[40:47] know that when we wake up on the wrong
[40:49] side of the bed and we uh we're moody or
[40:53] we're going through something or things
[40:54] aren't right or we're in a lot of pain
[40:55] and we have a bad attitude. Uh these
[40:58] things are very very difficult to think
[41:00] that we can achieve
[41:02] and these are certainly not things that
[41:03] we can achieve within ourselves. I think
[41:06] the best image we could say is whenever
[41:08] we are being told to say sorry and we
[41:10] really don't feel like we're sorry. So
[41:12] what is it we
[41:13] say? I'm sorry.
[41:16] Right? That's not how this ought to be.
[41:20] But we should have love in our
[41:22] hearts where we can be compassionate for
[41:24] others. We can love as family, as
[41:26] brethren. We can be merciful. We can be
[41:30] considerate. This consideration is so
[41:32] great to where we'll even be willing to
[41:35] not do things for the sake of somebody
[41:37] else
[41:39] or do the right thing for the sake of
[41:41] somebody
[41:42] else. Vincent Van Go wrote this. So
[41:45] these are these letters that I was
[41:46] drawing from the very similar same ones.
[41:48] He says it is good to love as much as
[41:50] one can for there in lies true strength.
[41:54] And he who loves much does much and is
[41:56] capable of
[41:58] much. And that which is done with love
[42:01] is well
[42:03] done. If some of you only know Van Gogh
[42:06] as the painter who cut off his ear,
[42:08] there's a lot more to his testimony.
[42:10] He's a pastor of a church. His father
[42:12] pastored a church for uh much of his
[42:14] childhood and I most of his
[42:17] life and he loved the Lord though
[42:20] tortured and though battles with mental
[42:22] illness he wrote when he wrote he's
[42:24] often with every phrase it's scripture
[42:26] it's a hymn something from the Bible and
[42:29] he's drawing this theme not from some
[42:32] other painter of that time or
[42:33] philosopher but he says it's good to
[42:34] love as much as one can for therein lies
[42:37] true strength and he who loves much does
[42:40] much and is capable of much and that
[42:43] which is done with love is well
[42:49] done using these scriptures to emphasize
[42:52] the heart of a witness. Micah chapter
[42:56] 6:8. And he showed me, oh man, what is
[42:58] good? And what do the Lord require of
[43:01] thee? Remember how we've read already
[43:03] where it says that what are we to do in
[43:05] Zechariah? And it tells us uh how that
[43:07] we ought to love and and what we ought
[43:09] to do in Isaiah. Now in Micah, it says,
[43:10] "But to do justly, do what is right, and
[43:13] to love mercy or to love kindness, and
[43:15] to walk humbly with thy God. To love
[43:18] kindness and diligently practice it. To
[43:22] love faithfulness."
[43:24] These aren't just uh words that make for
[43:27] beautiful embroidery in someone's powder
[43:29] bath or guest
[43:30] bathroom. These are very real things
[43:33] that God has showed me what he requires
[43:35] for me. He wants me to do right. He
[43:37] wants me to love mercy and diligently
[43:38] practice it. He wants me to love
[43:40] faithfulness. And he wants me to walk
[43:41] humbly with God.
[43:44] Romans chapter 13:es 89 and 10 owe no
[43:47] man anything but to love one another.
[43:49] You only have one for sure debt to
[43:52] somebody else, and that's to love them.
[43:54] We have no other obligation than to
[43:57] love. For in that is fulfilled the law.
[44:00] Oh, no man anything but to love one
[44:02] another. And he that loveth another hath
[44:04] fulfilled the law. No other it could be
[44:06] said that he whatever you do in love is
[44:08] well done. He who loves much does much
[44:10] and is capable of much. Because he that
[44:12] loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
[44:16] For this thou shalt not commit adultery.
[44:18] Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not
[44:19] steal. Thou shalt not bear false
[44:20] witness. Thou shalt not covet. And if
[44:22] there be any other commandment, it is
[44:24] briefly comprehended in this saying,
[44:25] namely, thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[44:27] thyself. If we truly had love at our
[44:31] core and in our hearts, we would not
[44:33] kill. We would not steal. We would not
[44:34] bear false witness. We would not covet.
[44:37] This is why all the commandments can be
[44:39] summarized as thou shalt love thy
[44:41] neighbor as thyself.
[44:43] For verse 10 says, love workketh no ill
[44:45] to his neighbor. Therefore, love is the
[44:49] fulfilling of the law.
[44:52] One of the great poets of our age or the
[44:55] 20th century said, "Apart from love,
[44:57] there is no
[45:00] belief." With if there's no love,
[45:02] there's no faith. Beyond love, I think
[45:05] he says, "By beyond love, there is no
[45:07] belief.
[45:09] There's no faith beyond
[45:10] love. There there's there's no kindness,
[45:14] compassion, charity, no charity beyond
[45:19] charity. Love workketh no ill to his
[45:22] neighbor. Therefore, love is the
[45:24] fulfilling of the law.
[45:28] In John chap 21 15 16 and 17, Jesus
[45:32] before his ascension is sitting with his
[45:35] disciples after his resurrection and
[45:36] before he ascends. So then when they had
[45:38] dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter,
[45:40] remember it was Simon Peter that he
[45:42] first that Andrew had witnessed to and
[45:44] testified to. And he stayed faithful all
[45:46] these years. He says, "Simon son of
[45:48] Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?"
[45:51] And I know there's something to the fact
[45:54] that Jesus asked if he has this agape
[45:56] love for Christ more than these other
[45:58] things. He says, he said to him, "Yay,
[46:00] Lord, thou knowest that
[46:01] I feel love thee." He saith unto him,
[46:04] "Feed my lambs." I just want you to
[46:06] catch this principle here. He saith to
[46:09] him again the second time, Simon, son of
[46:10] Jonas, lovest thou me? Saith unto him,
[46:12] Yay Lord, thou knowest that I love
[46:15] thee. He saith unto him, feed my
[46:18] sheep. There is a distinction. Saith
[46:22] unto him the third time, Simon the son
[46:23] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was
[46:25] grieved because he had said the third
[46:27] time, lovest thou me? And he said to
[46:28] him, Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou
[46:32] knowest that I love thee. And Jesus
[46:35] saith unto him, "Feed my
[46:37] sheep." Feed it means to
[46:41] keep. He's saying, "You have a duty to
[46:44] promote the health of my lambs. You have
[46:47] a duty to the welfare of my sheep. If
[46:50] you love me, feed my
[46:53] sheep." What is it we say? Even brother
[46:55] Brandon said, "If you love me, the best
[46:56] thing you could do is do something good
[46:58] for my children." Amen.
[47:01] There's ways that we can be offended
[47:04] often and we we can handle it. But when
[47:06] it comes to our wives or our spouses,
[47:08] our kids, that's sometimes that it's
[47:10] really hard to look past
[47:12] that. So when you if you love someone
[47:16] saying if you love me then keep the
[47:19] lambs, keep the
[47:21] sheep. Brother Bam references this
[47:23] scripture in the sermon convinced then
[47:25] concerned. Jesus said if you love me
[47:27] feed my sheep. He said, 'Now, that's
[47:29] where I think we failed a lot is feeding
[47:31] his sheep. If you love me, feed my
[47:34] sheep. I'm wanting to draw from this
[47:35] principle from the sermon. I'm convinced
[47:37] of truth. Truth is in my heart. I I have
[47:41] truth in my heart. Now, possessing truth
[47:43] and being convinced of it. I'm concerned
[47:46] for those who are outside of this truth.
[47:49] I'm concerned for those who could
[47:51] benefit by this truth. And brother
[47:53] Brandam in preaching this uses this
[47:55] thought because he's preaching convinced
[47:57] then concerned. And he says, "Here's
[47:58] where there's a problem is is if you
[48:00] love me, feed my sheep." Today, it's
[48:02] almost share my sheep.
[48:05] Get them into a place and take
[48:06] everything they got and make them pledge
[48:09] their home and all of their age pensions
[48:11] and everything else. Talk about a
[48:12] sharing. Jesus never said that. It's
[48:16] remarkable just how quickly, whether it
[48:18] be the message or Christianity is turned
[48:20] around to where you serve the church and
[48:22] not Christ. And you make all sorts of
[48:25] pledges and commitments to the church
[48:26] and to the ministry. And I'm going to
[48:28] lift up the hands of the ministry and
[48:29] I'm going to do this, I'm going to do
[48:30] that. And everyone is serving and at at
[48:33] the same time sacrificing their families
[48:35] all in the name of serving the church.
[48:37] And what's happening is the church is
[48:39] shearing the sheep and not promoting
[48:42] their welfare. That is right. I'll turn
[48:45] it around. Not to necessarily uh take
[48:47] away from the type, but I believe that
[48:49] what my job is as a pastor when I come
[48:51] here to ministers, I'm lifting up the
[48:52] hands of the ministry. You, the pastors
[48:56] in the homes, the head of the houses,
[48:57] the priests who are going to leave here
[48:59] today and going to do more work with
[49:01] your families than I can accomplish in a
[49:03] sermon.
[49:05] So that's the role of the church. That's
[49:06] the role of the priesthood to lift up
[49:08] the
[49:11] hands to help. He says, "Talk about a
[49:14] shearing." Jesus never said
[49:16] that. But it's gotten to a place to
[49:18] where it's take, take
[49:20] take and it's sometimes asked of you and
[49:23] you give it
[49:24] willingly. And that's not what God wants
[49:26] you to
[49:29] do. In 2 Thessalonians 3:5, it says,
[49:32] "Lord, direct your hearts into the love
[49:35] of God and into the patient waiting for
[49:38] Christ."
[49:41] I remember when I was just finalizing my
[49:43] notes yesterday afternoon, it was at
[49:45] this point that I was uh begin to remove
[49:48] some things and maybe I could have kept
[49:50] them in there because the question would
[49:52] be should we end early so we beat the
[49:55] crowds or preach long enough so that
[49:56] they're
[49:58] gone. I don't know where are we at on
[50:00] this? Anybody where when are your
[50:05] reservations? The Lord direct your
[50:07] hearts into the love of God.
[50:10] It's just desire that he would that we
[50:14] would be conducted by directed by his
[50:19] love. Let the Holy Spirit operate in our
[50:23] hearts to express the heart of God. And
[50:25] it says, "And into the patient waiting
[50:27] for Christ," it's not so much that we're
[50:29] waiting patiently for Christ, but that
[50:31] we could also demonstrate Christ
[50:35] perseverance. as he demonstrated this
[50:37] patient endurance, we likewise would do
[50:39] the
[50:40] same. Lord, direct our hearts, it's at
[50:44] the heart of it, into the love of
[50:47] God. And the sermon convinced then
[50:49] concerned. Brother Bam says, I believe
[50:50] that every man, every woman, every boy
[50:52] or girl that ever stays long enough,
[50:53] he's talking about how Andrew terried,
[50:55] how that they these uh they had tried
[50:58] with Christ and Andrew terried with
[50:59] Christ had been with them was convinced
[51:02] that he was then concerned. He says, "If
[51:04] you stay long enough that you're
[51:05] convinced that it's right and it is the
[51:07] Holy Ghost, you are burdened so hard in
[51:10] your heart that you can't stand still
[51:12] and let these people die like this in
[51:14] shame and
[51:15] sin. It'll grind the very heart out of
[51:18] you." Wednesday night, I'd like like to
[51:19] get into that marking angel who is
[51:21] marking those who are signing and crying
[51:23] for the abominations of the people. What
[51:25] that heart ought to look like.
[51:28] I know there's an attitude where we're
[51:30] blushing at sin and sometimes we're just
[51:32] uh whether it be pearl clutching or it's
[51:34] righteous indignation, but where is the
[51:37] praying and the crying over it? He says
[51:40] it'll grind the very heart out of you to
[51:41] get out there on the streets. It does
[51:43] any Christian to see people wholly given
[51:46] over to
[51:48] sin. We ought not to become numb to it
[51:52] and callous. There's a lot of things
[51:53] we've done as survival mechanisms. a lot
[51:55] of things that maybe don't bother us.
[51:57] And I don't believe that we should be
[51:58] just always creeped out, our skin
[52:00] crawling and unable to conduct ourselves
[52:03] a as as sane, sensiblely human beings
[52:05] out in society. But we ought not to get
[52:07] so numb,
[52:09] we can't be grieved for it,
[52:11] can't be moved by it.
[52:14] He refers to drinking, gambling,
[52:16] cursing, swearing, smoking, and there's
[52:17] a litany of things that we could add to
[52:19] that. But if you're concerned, if you're
[52:22] convinced, then you're concerned. In
[52:23] other words, you're burdened in your
[52:25] heart. You have a heart that has
[52:27] feeling. Do you understand the the the
[52:29] angle that I'm trying to just emphasize
[52:31] in this moment that if we're going to
[52:32] witness the message, our hearts have to
[52:34] be right. There has to be some feeling
[52:36] for the person. There has to be some
[52:38] empathy. And I'm not even talking about
[52:40] being a witness in terms of, hey, let me
[52:41] just talk to you about the word of God
[52:43] or the Bible says this is wrong. Just in
[52:44] your life, you have to have a feeling
[52:46] for others.
[52:50] This feeling I believe is demonstrated
[52:51] as God has used the example of David and
[52:54] the feeling he had for
[52:57] Abselum. this tender-heartedness and
[53:00] these things that we've
[53:01] read believe it's demonstrated as the
[53:04] heart of a parent and I think it's
[53:07] appropriate to minister on these things
[53:08] on Mother's Day because in Deuteronomy
[53:10] chapter 32 10 and 11 he found him Jacob
[53:15] his son found him in a desert land in
[53:16] the waste howling wilderness he led him
[53:19] about he led his children about he
[53:21] instructed him this is what a a a mother
[53:24] does within the home this is what
[53:26] parents are called to do to lead to
[53:27] instruct He kept him as the apple of his
[53:31] eye. And he says, "As as an eagle stirth
[53:34] up her nest." This is a mother eagle.
[53:36] Flutterth over her young, spreadth
[53:38] abroad her wings, taketh him, beareth
[53:40] them on her wings. This is what Christ,
[53:44] this is what God did to
[53:45] Israel. God in the scripture uses the
[53:49] love of a mother to awaken us to his
[53:51] love. How that God would not forget us
[53:54] no more than a mother would forget the
[53:55] child that she nursed. God compares his
[53:57] heart here to the heart of a mother
[54:00] eagle. Matthew 23:37. Oh Jerusalem,
[54:03] Jerusalem, thou that klest the prophets
[54:05] and stonest them which are sent unto
[54:07] thee, how often would I have gathered
[54:08] thy children together, even as a hen
[54:11] gatherth her chickens under her wings,
[54:14] and ye would not think of those psalms
[54:17] over and over about gathering under his
[54:19] wings. It's that illusion to that mother
[54:22] who will protect, who not only protect,
[54:24] but she'll instruct, she'll lead about,
[54:26] she will
[54:28] feed. She flutters over her young. God
[54:30] as a parent busies himself over his
[54:36] children. I want to in closing, I would
[54:39] like to
[54:40] use this example of a mother's love as
[54:44] the heart of a true witness.
[54:46] Brother Brandon when he's preaching
[54:48] convinced and concerned he says if your
[54:50] daughter's out there making mud cakes I
[54:52] think it is out in the street or Johnny
[54:54] or whatever and the some of the tellings
[54:56] of it. He says if they're out there in
[54:57] the street they're going to get hit by a
[54:58] car then you're
[55:00] concerned and you do something about it.
[55:03] So that's what a real parent is going to
[55:04] do. They're going to rescue that kid
[55:06] from the danger. Not just say oh well
[55:08] they got to learn
[55:10] lessons. You know they're going to have
[55:12] to learn it somehow.
[55:16] The Lord kept dealing with my heart over
[55:17] and over again on the story that I think
[55:19] most of us if not all of us here are
[55:21] familiar with. But brother Bam tells the
[55:23] story of the conversion of a hunting
[55:24] buddy he had when he was a young man. He
[55:27] refers to him in one place as Harry be
[55:29] call. There's two different ways that
[55:30] the name is spelled even in the message
[55:32] the table or at least in the message uh
[55:34] software I use to search and but he
[55:36] called him Bert Call. as a young man. He
[55:39] was out hunting with him in the
[55:40] Northwoods or Maine and New Hampshire in
[55:42] that area and it he's hunting with him
[55:44] and brother Bannam talks about how that
[55:46] you know he's a conscientious hunter and
[55:48] he's hunting for a c specific reason but
[55:51] in the telling of it how many here just
[55:53] by show of hands know the story that
[55:54] we're talking about. Oh, good. So,
[55:56] everyone's uh most of us if not all of
[55:58] us are on the same page here. But
[56:00] brother Brandham tells a story about how
[56:02] as a young man he was out hunting and
[56:04] that his hunting buddy Bert uh said told
[56:08] him, "Watch this." And he uses an
[56:11] artificial call. He's using a call. He's
[56:14] using it himself. And what it does is it
[56:17] impersonates the call of a wounded fawn
[56:21] or imitates the call of a fawn. And it's
[56:24] done to specifically provoke a dough or
[56:28] a mother deer to be drawn and attracted
[56:32] to that sound. Bert's wanting to be a
[56:34] false
[56:36] witness. And in the telling of the
[56:38] story, Bert uses that
[56:40] call and it provoked this mother deer to
[56:44] expose herself to
[56:47] harm. The the mother deer knew there was
[56:50] hunters there. That's why they hadn't
[56:51] seen her as of yet. That's why it took
[56:53] that use of an artificial
[56:55] call. And so it wasn't that the the
[56:58] mother deer's just coming along and
[56:59] didn't know anything, but there's some
[57:00] sensitivity to the fact that there's
[57:02] danger present. But that call used by
[57:05] Burke call and I don't think there's any
[57:07] there's no connection there. Is it
[57:09] spelled two different ways in the
[57:10] message and I haven't been able to find
[57:13] any record of this person. Brother Bam
[57:15] does see him many many years later in a
[57:17] meeting. He calls him Harry call. So
[57:18] it's not like Albert Lincoln call or
[57:20] anybody like that. It was a specific
[57:22] friend who might have just shared some
[57:23] similarities with somebody else. But
[57:26] he's
[57:27] uh and he begins to use this
[57:31] call. This deer knew there was
[57:34] danger. Knew that there was a chance
[57:37] that these hunters would shoot at her
[57:40] and she risked it anyways cuz the heart
[57:43] of a mother was that could be my child
[57:47] that's
[57:49] calling. And brother Brandham when he
[57:51] tells the story says he's waiting for
[57:53] that gun to go
[57:54] off and he was waiting and then he was
[57:58] waiting and that dough willing to risk
[58:03] her own life for her child led to Bert's
[58:08] conversion and many years later we find
[58:10] that he's still serving the Lord coming
[58:12] to brother Bram's meetings mentioning
[58:13] brother Bram do you remember that dear
[58:16] it's that moment that turning point in
[58:17] his
[58:18] life must have had quite write a
[58:20] testimony based upon the way brother
[58:21] Brandham described it. But as a young
[58:23] man, his life
[58:25] changed and by what? Brother Brandham
[58:27] says it in many, many different places.
[58:29] The witness of that mother.
[58:33] The love that that mother dear had for
[58:35] her child
[58:38] testified to a
[58:40] sinner. That's the love that we ought to
[58:42] have on our hearts. That's the witness
[58:45] that we ought to have. Brother Brandham
[58:46] in the sermon here ye him when he told
[58:48] this story of this he says would you
[58:50] like to have a real love for
[58:53] God just as much love for Christ as that
[58:55] old mother dear had for her
[58:57] baby. Notice the the orientation here
[59:00] that a a mother dear a natural animal
[59:04] who has a love for her child would
[59:06] respond to something and it would
[59:08] provoke and call out that real genuine
[59:11] love she had for her fawn and that would
[59:14] be a witness to a sinner. very real
[59:16] event. And he said, "Now, wouldn't you
[59:18] like to have that kind of love for
[59:20] Christ so that when the moment called
[59:22] for it, your love for Christ would
[59:24] expose you as a true witness, willing to
[59:27] deliver a soul, regardless of what the
[59:29] consequence may be, you have enough love
[59:31] in your heart to stand true for Christ."
[59:33] Amen. Brother Brandham says that could
[59:36] face death or regardless of what
[59:38] persecution or what people thought you
[59:40] could stand in the faith and give a
[59:42] witness for the glory of
[59:44] God. That's at the heart of the art of
[59:47] witnessing is love. There's this at the
[59:49] heart of a witness is this conviction
[59:52] that God's word is true and he's worth
[59:54] risking.
[59:56] Risking persecution or what people
[59:58] thought. Not so much to save your skin.
[1:00:02] You could keep your mouth shut and save
[1:00:03] it. But such a love for Christ that it
[1:00:07] draws you out into the open.
[1:00:10] Draws you out to be seen. Puts you in a
[1:00:13] position where others could take shots
[1:00:14] at you. But there could be a sinner
[1:00:17] nearby who sees the love you have for
[1:00:22] Christ. And that's what wins them over.
[1:00:26] If we could have our musicians come.
[1:00:29] Brother Brandham here ye him says the
[1:00:31] love different places here this is a
[1:00:34] different one he says the love that that
[1:00:36] mother dear was displaying she couldn't
[1:00:38] help that that's the way it has to be
[1:00:41] for us to where we can't help it she was
[1:00:43] a
[1:00:45] mother let me tell you brothers and
[1:00:47] sisters when the people who belong to
[1:00:48] the church of the living God will
[1:00:50] display real Christian love it will
[1:00:52] conquer more sinners than all the other
[1:00:55] things you could put together
[1:00:57] I don't know brother brand what if we
[1:00:58] lined up all our prayer lines end to
[1:01:00] end.
[1:01:02] He said, "No, a real display of
[1:01:05] Christian love will conquer more sinners
[1:01:08] than all the other things you can put
[1:01:10] together,
[1:01:11] all the other
[1:01:13] programs, going out buying tamboots and
[1:01:15] tambourines and going on the street
[1:01:17] corner and plucking some Cochman songs,
[1:01:20] hoping that somebody hears it, is drawn
[1:01:22] to the melody, and then I could scream
[1:01:24] over a loudspeaker, "Abortions of the
[1:01:27] devil." Right? and we're going to win a
[1:01:29] lot of souls.
[1:01:31] He says, "More than any of those things
[1:01:32] put together, real Christian love will
[1:01:35] conquer sin and others win
[1:01:38] [Music]
[1:01:41] sinners." One more statement to read.
[1:01:43] It's from here ye him, but if you could
[1:01:44] just consider this in your heart because
[1:01:47] brother says, "And I pray that and I
[1:01:49] want this to I want you to take this to
[1:01:50] your hearts today, Lord." As we pray
[1:01:52] this, as he's speak he's speaking to the
[1:01:54] Lord, I want you to take this to your
[1:01:55] heart. He's praying. says, "I pray that
[1:01:57] to this very hour that you'll send the
[1:01:59] Holy Spirit into their
[1:02:01] heart that'll give them the love that'll
[1:02:03] make them stand just as true to you as
[1:02:07] that mother dear did for the
[1:02:09] baby." You're you said you're most of
[1:02:11] you, almost all of you said you're
[1:02:13] familiar with the story. At that heart
[1:02:15] of that mother, she was a true witness.
[1:02:19] She faced knowable
[1:02:22] danger and in doing so was a witness for
[1:02:26] Christ. And it was that love Bert said
[1:02:28] that display of love melted his heart.
[1:02:32] The display of
[1:02:34] love. It wasn't that he used the call to
[1:02:37] take some game and brother Brandham
[1:02:38] said, "All right, here I'll show you how
[1:02:39] it's done." A and Brother Brandham took
[1:02:41] it more ethically and he's like, "Man,
[1:02:43] you know what? You're a good Christian
[1:02:44] guy. You got the bigger buck." No, it
[1:02:47] was a display of
[1:02:50] love and it reached the heart of Bert
[1:02:53] Call. It led to his conversion. Brother
[1:02:55] says, "Give them that kind of love till
[1:02:56] they'll stand true to you as that mother
[1:02:58] did for her baby. Grant it, Lord. May
[1:03:00] they live such lives of
[1:03:03] discipline." From this
[1:03:05] on until all this city and around cities
[1:03:08] where they live may say when they pass
[1:03:11] down the street, "If there ever was a
[1:03:13] Christian, there they go." for the
[1:03:16] sweetness of that person. Though they
[1:03:18] don't belong to my de denomination, but
[1:03:20] yet they're real Christians, they are
[1:03:22] sweet and kind. Take it for what he
[1:03:27] means. Thou hast said in thy word, you
[1:03:30] are the salt of the earth. But if that
[1:03:33] salt has lost its savor and God, and
[1:03:35] this is a real kicker, he says, I'm
[1:03:37] afraid that's what's happened to the
[1:03:38] church. It's lost its sweetness. It's
[1:03:40] lost its love. It's lost its influence
[1:03:43] to bring sinners to you. That's right.
[1:03:47] Ah, not so fast. We're there and church
[1:03:50] is growing. He says, just taking in a
[1:03:51] bunch of members and baptize them and
[1:03:54] let them live in the world and their
[1:03:56] influence has corrupted the church.
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:00] Churches have swelled, not
[1:04:03] grown. The real growing is through the
[1:04:06] influence on sinners.
[1:04:09] Maybe it isn't the way that Andrew
[1:04:11] recognized this is the Christ. And he
[1:04:13] went and told Simon, "This is the truth.
[1:04:15] The master is come and call it for thee.
[1:04:17] This is the Messiah that we long awaited
[1:04:21] for." It's only by that heart, the heart
[1:04:24] that's convinced of truth and with love
[1:04:27] in your heart that you can have a real
[1:04:29] influence to bring sinners to
[1:04:31] Christ. This is a challenge. This whole
[1:04:35] series this year has been with the
[1:04:38] inspiration of what does Christ look
[1:04:39] like
[1:04:40] today? God being the ultimate artist.
[1:04:43] How is he trying to render you, paint
[1:04:44] you? What portrait is he displaying out
[1:04:47] amongst the people where they could look
[1:04:48] and see Christ
[1:04:50] today? And he says it's lost its love
[1:04:53] and its influence to bring sinners to
[1:04:56] Christ. Lord, I don't want to lose my
[1:04:58] influence.
[1:05:00] I want I want to be an influence to lead
[1:05:02] others to you, not just to church. And
[1:05:05] there's such a vast array of this
[1:05:07] benefit in being a witness. We may say,
[1:05:09] well, that person uh doesn't believe
[1:05:12] this, doesn't do that, doesn't come to
[1:05:13] church, doesn't do this. What about
[1:05:14] healing? What about deliverance? What
[1:05:17] about peace? What about wisdom? There's
[1:05:19] so much that we could be witnessing. So
[1:05:21] much that we can be here for for others.
[1:05:23] And I want God to give me that kind of
[1:05:25] love for Christ that that mother dear
[1:05:27] had for her. just as a heart of a
[1:05:30] mother. She couldn't help but be that.
[1:05:31] Lord, I I want to have that kind of
[1:05:32] liberty in my heart to love. Let's stand
[1:05:36] to our feet. Let's pray
[1:05:38] together. We may not be early enough for
[1:05:41] the crowds or late enough for them to be
[1:05:45] gone, but enjoy your time together today
[1:05:48] with
[1:05:49] family. Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[1:05:52] Heavenly
[1:05:53] Father, Lord, it's such a wonderful
[1:05:55] privilege to be gathered in your
[1:05:56] presence today.
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:01] If we just did a
[1:06:03] simple query, Lord, and whatever engine
[1:06:06] we might use or AI model to try to
[1:06:09] uncover and source all the references in
[1:06:12] scripture to love and
[1:06:16] kindness, hundreds of statements, Lord.
[1:06:19] So there is this apparent theme and
[1:06:22] there's some of the obvious scriptures
[1:06:25] and
[1:06:27] characteristics, but you liken yourself
[1:06:29] to
[1:06:30] love. God is
[1:06:33] love. You're likened to
[1:06:36] light. And Lord, it challenges us then
[1:06:38] that if we're to be your light now, we
[1:06:40] are light in the Lord. Then Lord, it
[1:06:42] means that we
[1:06:43] must have your heart. We must have your
[1:06:47] mind. And it can't be watered down
[1:06:49] Christian Scientist love. It can't be
[1:06:51] wokeism. It can't be just some liberal
[1:06:55] social pandering. Got to be real,
[1:06:59] Lord. Real genuine
[1:07:02] concern as the result of a real genuine
[1:07:04] conviction of
[1:07:07] truth. I know that our first influence
[1:07:10] will be in our homes. Our influence will
[1:07:12] be in a church and maybe those that we
[1:07:15] homeschool with and homeschool groups
[1:07:16] and those that we come in contact
[1:07:18] closely with
[1:07:19] family. And it would be even in those
[1:07:21] places, Lord. We want to be a
[1:07:24] witness. We're to be witnesses first at
[1:07:26] Jerusalem. We're to be witnesses abroad.
[1:07:29] As the prophet prayed it, may we have
[1:07:31] such love in our hearts that in our
[1:07:34] cities and the cities round about,
[1:07:35] wherever we are, we could be a witness
[1:07:37] to the glory of God.
[1:07:41] I pray that you would
[1:07:42] encourage mothers today whether
[1:07:45] regardless of where they are in the
[1:07:46] stage of raising their children. Maybe
[1:07:48] now their children have moved on. Maybe
[1:07:51] grandparenthood is on the horizon.
[1:07:53] Whatever it might be, Lord, may there be
[1:07:55] an
[1:07:56] encouragement for their role that they
[1:07:59] have in expressing genuine love and care
[1:08:01] and
[1:08:02] concern. Encourage them today, Lord, as
[1:08:04] this is their day. ism. Over a 100 years
[1:08:07] ago, the government pronounced this day
[1:08:10] to be Mother's
[1:08:13] Day. May May they feel a special
[1:08:16] blessing and Lord in type in parallel.
[1:08:19] May we as believers have such love for
[1:08:21] you as it was demonstrated by that
[1:08:23] mother dear that we could lead others to
[1:08:25] you to Christ to see not condemnation
[1:08:28] but genuine conviction melt all the
[1:08:30] defenses and all the
[1:08:31] stubbornness of even the crulest person.
[1:08:35] Bless us today as we worship you. Be
[1:08:37] with those that are soon dismissed and
[1:08:40] their family gatherings. May you be with
[1:08:42] us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
