TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're just going to jump right into this this evening and just touch on a few points that will pick up on what we were talking about last Wednesday as we took a service on Love's evidence and will continue on part two of that and I think we kind of we're definitely towards the end focusing on some of the attributes of human love that are associated with perfect love and how that you just can't take certain attributes of what we call love or kindness or being sweet and gentle and Associate that with Divine love because there are attributes that we would think are related to love that are not perfect love and as we read here about what the fruit of the spirit is we know that the fruit of the spirit is the manifestation of the promised word the fruit of the spirit is the manifestation of the word and it's when it's not the word that's manifesting itself then it becomes fruits and not fruit because it is the fruit of the spirit but then once it just becomes humanistic and you're kind of grabbing hold of certain things then there's no harmony with the nature of God there's no cohesiveness among among those other attributes so it just becomes fruits of the spirit and but we know that the fruit of the spirit is an inward work of Grace by the word and when that begins to manifest it's singular the fruit of the spirit and has different ways that that fruit we enjoy that fruit and it is through that joy and that meekness and that Temperance and the peace and the long-suffering but when it's the inward work of Grace the fruit of the spirit manifests in those different ways but if we took those different things of joy and peace and long-suffering and gentleness and goodness and faith and meekness and Temperance those can all be just mere human emotional states and if they're just an emotional state that can be duplicated in other words it's not actually the fruit of the spirit but it's it's impersonated through human behavior and when we say impersonated when we say any one of these things can be impersonated what we're saying is it can look like the fruit it can sound like the fruit it can feel like the fruit or that which the spirit produces but it's just a carnal uh human emotion or it's just carnally inspired it's not the word that's doing it but we know that one thing that cannot be impersonated one thing that cannot be duplicated that is the word of God and in the word even in saying that I know when we think about the word cannot be impersonated there's a mysterious element to that saying well then what is the word if the word is kindness and I'm impersonating kindness am I not impersonating the word but when it's the word in you acting that cannot be impersonated it can only be duplicated in a carnal way but you can't replicate the word itself and so I think some of the things we were Minister on last time to kind of help catch us up to this evening is the holy spirit is the life of God living in you to perform his word to perform the word of God and that's the best way for me to describe perfect love perfect love is the holy spirit in you performing God's word and some of the things we've kind of touched on through these last few weeks is that perfect love it protects always protects God's purpose perfect love is not always be kind but it's always be kind to preserve God's purpose oh it's not just love your neighbor and as long as you quote unquote make your neighbor feel loved that's doing it but no it must preserve and protect God's purpose because the holy spirit is desirous of God's perfect will being performed not just trying to make the other person feel good and so even in manifesting perfect love to somebody else it may hurt or offend it might even hurt or offend us but it never hurts or fends God's will and so we could say the word expressed is perfect love expressed and I'm going to touch on some points in the scripture to kind of help reinforce that it's a Divine manifestation of the word is love now tonight and I've kind of been holding off on these things they fit kind of just as support for all the things that we've been ministering on perfect love but I want to look at the connection between the word and perfect love or charity so the connection between the word which is God which God is the lover and and perfect love which is charity and that's why we're calling the manifestation of love as Love's evidence and if you could I know tonight I know it's kind of a Wednesday night but I will ask you just to please Focus you might have already had a really really rough week and an even worse day today than Monday which may be not easy not that hard because Monday was a holiday hopefully for most people but I feel that when it comes to preaching the word of God you can't you can't take a night off and so if you could this is going to build tonight and um I like to do that on Wednesday nights because I think that if if anyone who missed service just happens to hear about how it went or catch it I would want them to be able to say I wish I was there and so if that's my sole motivation tonight and it does you good then that I think that'll suffice but in looking at this if you could just focus because the first I'm going to go through three connections there's more there's different ways you could say this but I think this will help us to understand that perfect love is the manifestation of the word the first connection I want you to see between God and perfect love is God is the word and God is love John 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so many different places we could go to to see how that God being the Eternal one the invisible one who then formed himself into the logos which would be an expression of God and we could say in the beginning was the word and then these words are this word is the the heart of God the thoughts of God his thoughtfulness expressed so we recognized just in terms of formula God is the word in the beginning was the word and the word is God and then as we've read in first John chapter 4 verse 7 for Love For Love is of God and then it says God is love and so we know that God is love and God is love that means it's not just God is loving or God is kind but it makes love or charity this essential attribute of God that can be descriptive of God it's like God is love and so when we see that God is the word the Bible says that God is love so that's a connection between the word and perfect love now the second connection just do you see how how much kinship there is between God and this perfect love the Bible says that God's word will never fail it'll never pass away and God's love will never fail in Matthew chapter 24 verse 35 it says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now what Jesus says my words we have to realize it's not just the the the grammar he's using or the physical words that he's saying that this is just a man when he says my words but when he says my words he's speaking about the word of God as John said in John 3 34 for he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him so when Jesus says my word shall not pass away it's God that gave him the words to speak he said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life he said I am the way the truth of life he he the words that he speaks are they are spirit and they are life they're not just merely the words that I speak to you but he's saying the words that I'm speaking these are the words of God he said I do nothing of myself but as my father taught me I speak these things so when he says the words that I speak shall never pass away Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall ever pass away he's saying the word of God will never fail it'll never pass away and then the Bible says in First Corinthians 13 8 charity never faileth says but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away but charity never faileth now I'm just using quick scriptures that we can grab them hold of to recognize these connections between the word and perfect love because I believe it's very important for us to understand how love manifests itself we looked at how love looks we're looking at Love's evidence it says charity never faileth and there's another thing that never fails and that's God's word so you have the connection God is love and God is his word the word will never fail charity will never fail and then this verse first John 2 17 it ties us into the next connection but it says in the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so it reminds us that the world the things of the world will pass away the lust of the world will pass away hatred has an end because the object of hate will cease to exist but this love he that doeth the will of God abideth forever and that leads us to the third connection that the scriptural trait of perfect love or the love for God is keeping God's word now this it's in this area I think I'll probably be staying for the rest of the evening even though we're going to move Beyond these connections but I want I'm using that phrase keep the word of God because I think sometimes and I believe it's an appropriate word and it's true to obey the word of God is a scriptural trait of perfect love but it's not just obedience and the reason why I say that is because it's not just some people it's not just obedience and I'd say because some people obey out of fear the wrong kind of fear they'll they'll obey they'll do what someone says solely out of fear they say fear is a great motivator and some leadership styles are to Simply motivate the People by fear into subjection and so some obey and even obey the Bible out of the wrong kind of fear it's not the fear that one who loves someone has that reverential respect and desires to please them and never would want to offend them it's more of a fear of punishment the wrong kind of fear so love is not just obedience but love and this is hopefully becomes very very clear to you love is keeping the word of God and that's a special phrase in John chapter 14 verses 23 and 24 Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and remember His words are not just his words they are the word of God the words that I speak unto you their spirit and life the words that I speak I have been taught by the father my my word is the word of God the words that I speak are the words of God he says he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings in the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me so he's saying if you love me you'll keep God's word it's not just his words but it's God's word I remember that love is not just sacrificial but love is submissive to the word of God that when Jesus gave down laid down his life as his greater love than this hath no man then he laid down his life for his friends and lays down his life for laid down his life for us it wasn't that laying down his life was the ultimate expression of love because that's the most you could give but this Greater Love was not just sacrifice but he laid down his life in obedience to the word as we read in first Samuel 15 how that Saul thought through worship and through sacrifice and and offerings to God that it was somehow cover the fact that he had not obeyed God's word and the prophet says hath the Lord is greater delight and birth burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord is does he does he tell you to do something and then if you offer sacrifice he's like oh you know what never mind since you got me a gift and you did something nice for me and you worship me it doesn't matter that you disregarded what I taught he says no it says to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams and I think this a lot of times it kind of calls out where a lot of nominal Christianity is today as they think through extravagant worship and through pyrotechnics and everything else if they could just Heap praise upon Gods with their lips and they could just show a lot of Honor with their lips and say well through this worship and this extravagance and all that we're giving and all that we're trying to do to serve this is a sacrifice of praise this is a sacrifice of service we're trying to do God a service but yet he says how can I receive that when you won't do what I ask you to do so I'd much rather you just obey the word that would mean more to me as the one that you profess the love then all these other extravagant things that you're trying to do absent doing what I would ask you to do and so Jesus is saying he that keeps my word this is a it's kind of love this kind of obedience is submissive to the word of God not just sacrificial but it's submissive to the word of God in first John 2 5 but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby no we that we are in him I know we've covered a lot in first John already through these several parts in this series but notice again how this is that scriptural trait of perfect love is to keep the word of God he will keep my words he that keeps my words if a man loves me he keeps my words who so keepeth his word when God's word is kept it says verily in him is the love of God perfected in other words God's love is satisfied the objective of love the the very objective of him loving us and US loving him is accomplished when we keep his will so when God's word is kept God's love is satisfied he's satisfied his love that he projected to us his accomplish his objective and then our love for him receives it satisfaction when we keep his word going back to Saul's offerings uh at that time of war and he's offering up these sacrifices and God says you know what or when he did not obey uh to to slaughter everything so I kept these things for sacrifice in both instances God wanted him to obey and that would satisfy desire that's what God wanted it would have satisfied Saul to obey the word of God but instead he tormented himself through Disobedience so whosoever keeps the word of God it's in that that love is satisfied in first John chapter 5 verses 2 and 3 it says by this we know that we love the children of God and there's a key phrase because you cannot love the children of God unless you love God and keep his Commandments so if you say you love the people of God and you say that you love the children of God but you do not love God and keep his Commandments then you don't know that you love the children of God oh I know that I love you and say well that's the greatest thing I could do is to love one another how do I know that I love you if I don't love God and keep his Commandments if those two are sacrificed for the sake of loving you I can't actually love you so for by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous I hope to spend a little bit of time on this enough for us to catch a deeper or maybe not catch just to remind you of the depth of this verse to when it says that we keep his Commandments and I would join this when he says he that will keep my word and he that keepeth his word when it says that we this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments I believe it's a principle that's easily misunderstood maybe even more easily misapplied and probably it's easier for us to misapply it to other people than it is ourselves but we can live under a wrong conception of this and Miss what God means when he says keep my Commandments because again we could say if you love me you'll obey me and and I think that's maybe a fair way to summarize what the Bible's saying if you love me you'll obey me but again it's not just obedience in other words we're not just checking a box we say the Bible says to do this and I just need to do it and that somehow absent some whatever's in your heart your motive and objective and how you feel when you're doing it and this is exactly what John is touching on he says this is the love of the love of God that we keep his Commandments and in the keeping of it it can't be Grievous because it's not it's not just that you do it but there's something to it there's some benefit in it there's some desire attached to it and so when it says keep his Commandments it does not mean that obedience becomes our task or obligation this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments it's not like okay so you're telling me that unless I love God I'm going to go to hell forever and the only way I can love God is if I do what he says and so all right well then I'll just do what he says and we look at his well this is some sort of task um I hope this is so maybe okay to say this but I've been studying on a thought and I think right now my working title is the the shadows of Catholicism and just how much the how the Shadows there's still Catholicism in a lot of us and the way that we worship God it's under that strict dogma of penance and Punishment and tribulation and purgatory and that's the motivation like everything we do is a motivation to somehow avoid God's judgment it's the wrong way to love God because love is not a task or an obligation because it says here to keep he that keepeth his Commandments the word is translated to reserve to observe to watch or Preserve and so the word to keep he that keeps his Commandments it means to take care of to guard to keep hold to keep pure to reserve or observe so when the Bible says when we love God we keep his Commandments it's not just in the strict obedience to it but we're regarding it we're keeping his Commandments pure we're keeping them whole the Commandment there is a charge or injunction that which an office requires or prescribed so there's some prescribed rule according to uh how things are done properly so when he says that this is my this is God's love this is how we know that we love God we're going to guard that what is required of us we're going to keep pure what he expects from us we're going to preserve this virtue by by the result of this Union that we have of them with him this obligation that we have is not by by law but it arises from relationship to take care of to keep pure to to preserve uh this this charge or this is injunction that's required by my relationship to God he says in this commandment is not Grievous meaning heavy or weighty I think is the other ways that it's translated but it's not burdensome severe violent cruel unsparing or trouble this is the love of God that will keep and guard his his word we'll keep it pure so it it's obedience but it's also it's preserving what the intent of it it's the value of it to keep pure to keep hold to reserve it to take care of it and and as I keep the word this isn't trouble for me it doesn't trouble me to do it in other words I don't find my soul unrest I don't find my peace taken away from me it's not violent it's not cruel it's not severe to keep the word of God now if we could keep that in mind that in keeping the word of God it's not severe or violent that this is this is the love of God that I keep his Commandments and in keeping it I don't find myself brought down I find that in keeping the word of God it's not violent or cruel this reveals the true nature of love this this reveals how it looks how it manifests the character and traits of love if you look at Romans chapter 13 verses 8 to 10 with me he says oh no man anything but to love one another so it says that we have some debt of love to one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law now that's that's quite a mouthful that when I have loved you I have fulfilled the law he says for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself we've already identified how Jesus Christ teaches this very thing that this is all the law and the prophets hang on this that they can all be summarized in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and he says love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law I think that says that to me is significant as we've already read it in Galatians that all law is fulfilled in one word to love thy neighbor as thyself uh I think that's something we ought to constantly remind ourselves of because the Bible's saying it and it's written right now very plainly it's repeated several times there's often emphasis in it that all the law is fulfilled in one word to love thy neighbor as thyself and again it instructs us that we have to love ourselves correctly to love our neighbors correctly those of us who are self-loathing and hate ourselves and you know can't love ourselves or forgive ourselves it may be why we treat everyone else the same way but there's there's a lot more in there there's a lot in it love thy neighbor as thyself it says love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law so love renders when it says oh no man anything but to love one another love renders what is due and we say what is due it's not what you think it is but it's what's proper what's right not so much as a debt or obligation but because it's right so when love gives what is due and you owe the debt to love one another it's not because you're in deficit but it's because it's what is right this is what is expected of Christians this is how Christians ought to act in their words and their attitude and their treatment of other people that they ought to love one another because it's right and so as we've said before perfect love preserves God's perfect will this is righteousness this is just this is pure and and we could say that if you're keeping God's will that you you you're under this injunction to do what is right and it's to love one another and it's saying in loving one another you'll never do any of the things he mentions here Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal thus shall not bear false witness they shall not covet there be any other commandment there it's all briefly comprehended in this saying in other words he's saying if you'll love your neighbor as yourself you will not do any of these things the same is said of what he says in the works of the flesh adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies Indians murders drunkenness revilings and such the like these are all associated with not loving your neighbor as yourself because it says in loving your neighbor you cannot work ill that means evil or wickedness you cannot act with the bad motive towards your neighbor you cannot act with the wrong objective if you say well I heard where if if they've ever heard the truth they're condemned and so I hate them so much I'm going to share the truth with them and hope he rejects it that's the wrong motive to say that it works no ill it's not destructive or injurious love cannot work evil towards somebody else love cannot work wickedness towards someone else amen now I know that there's there's a thought here we say okay it can't work evil it can't be Wicked it it can have the wrong motive can't be jealous it can't hate can't have variance and I want to say it this way but it also cannot compromise the word of God and you can certainly compromise the word of God in any one of those attributes but we cannot compromise the word of God for the sake of quote unquote loving our neighbors in other words loving your neighbor cannot directly cause confusion regarding God's word loving your neighbor cannot pervert God's will cannot pervert God's word you can say well I'm just loving my neighbor and cause confusion about God's attitude I'm just loving my brother and serving my brother and cause confusion about what God's word is I think that that kind of begins to open up a little bit depth to it to where we should never be hateful we should never be spiteful we should never be arrogant we should never be cruel we should never be injurious but we cannot love if we're not keeping God's word but I'm keeping it pure if we're not standing for truth and standing for what is right in Genesis chapter 4 verse 7 after Cain after Abel's sacrifices uh received by God and God had respect unto able sacrifice and Cain gets very very angry and God says to Cain if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and I believe next week when we pick up on love and hate we'll touch more on this hopefully next week but God's love in this instance this was God's love being projected to Cain and it did not change in the presence of Cain being the very soul and or angry it did not change truth our god did not change the Revelation to make it any easier he didn't see Cain get all upset and go oh whoa you know what calm down and God didn't say now if I don't just step in and let them get happy with what he offered he's going to end up killing Abel God did not compromise he did not Pat Kane on the back he just said well if you'll just do what your brother did if you'll just do right you'll be accepted he says but if you don't that's sin and that was this is this is how that God is showing love even decaying by giving an opportunity to know what is right love in that situation didn't say oh poor Cain he's at a disadvantage because he's just born a little bit different he's got these Tendencies and you know you know maybe it's unfair to have him you know be hacking a lamb and getting blood everywhere you know after all it's a pretty pretty nice job there Kane it's real beautiful altar God could not do it because love wouldn't let him and the notice in Mark chapter 10 when the Rich Young Ruler came and is requesting what it would take uh to live forever and how do you have eternal life it says then Jesus beholding him loved him now we can say oh that he had love but the word there is beholding him he projected love to him he showed him love and that's what it means to love one another it's to show love it's it it's that it's that projection of love and the spreading of love because if you can't just say that it's it's not the same Union that the believer has with God and the love between them but now it's a projection of love and he says beholding him loved him and he said said unto him you're perfect the way you are are just pay your tithes keep doing what you're doing and you'll have Treasures in Heaven and you'll live forever wait a minute sorry I was reading the newfangled Bible one thing about lack us well that's real nice right gonna come gonna cut right to the chase of where he's lacking go thy way and he hit somewhere it hurts sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me so it says Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him what he said is how he loved them he projected love he loved him when love he projected left him by speaking truth but not compromising and saying ah you know what he probably needs to sell everything but he's a rich guy he's lived a certain way he's young Let Him Live his life this is his opportunity but he told him what he needed to hear and we know the words that he speak spoke word those given to him by the father but here he is when Jesus asked him to do this one thing you lack that's love he spoke a hard saying to him and he projected love to him and he told the truth to him and this is how he loved his neighbor and and when he asked him to do this sell everything take up a cross in this there's loss there's sacrifice there's a burden there's a change of Lifestyle there's an upheaval of everything that he would love and a letting go of things that were dear to him and maybe a life of trouble ahead of him but what Jesus asked him to do was not injury because the love worketh no ill to your neighbor there's no evil though there was pain there was no evil even though there might be some hurt there was no evil though it might be hard because that's what love is love is keeping God's word even if it hurts and I find that obeying's real easy until it hurts Luke chapter 6 verse 27 it says but I say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you have we studied this out to find out whether or not he really said this because this is problematic right to those who hear love your enemies any person any church any organization any individual brother Branham said any church any organization any person that reasons against one punctuation of God's word is your enemy right and you're to love them even those that are anti-word even though that are untied to the spirit those that walk in the work in the works of this flesh those that walk against the spirit says love your enemies do good to them which hate you to love your enemy and to do good requires both the absence of evil but it also requires the presence of Truth you cannot love your enemies and do good unto them and do evil so not only does it require the absence of evil but it requires the presence of truth because you can't actually love them by essentially keeping silent or becoming a chameleon and trying to become inoffensive for the sake of not offending I say the highest form of love you can show towards your enemies is Manifest in the true nature of the word it's the highest form of love that you can show to your enemies is by manifesting the true nature of the word if you knew that God required something of someone and they're doing something against the word of God it's not the love of God to mock them it's not the love of God to condemn them it's not the love of God uh to kind of whisper about them behind your back but to project love would be to show them the right way in first Thessalonians 5 15 see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever followed that which is good both among yourselves and to all men speaking evil lying being envious the competitiveness the malice against one another towards someone is not love to be competitive with someone is not love to be jealous of someone in this base sort is not love to speak evil of somebody is not loved to lie about somebody's not love amen is that I hope it's maybe not for maybe it's you're thinking this is about as simple as brother Aaron has ever been in his life and that means I'm improving good but I want I hope that you can just just see how simple and plainness is that we are to love one another but if we're actually loving one another it's in the nature of the word of God it's protective of God's perfect will it won't cause confusion about what God's word is because there's sometimes people say well I did that because I want to be a witness or you know I did this because I was wanting to show love and and I'm not using any specifics maybe I have some in mind uh but it's important to take a step back and ask yourself as much as I was trying to show myself friendly as much as I'm trying to show love to my family as much as I was trying to be considerate and sensitive did it cause confusion about the word of God did it cause confusion about where your loyalties lie did it cause confusion about what the right way is and I guess I could also say the opposite that sometimes when we're wanting to make a point that they're wrong the way you do it does it cause confusion about the nature of God does it cause confusion about the spirit of God now in each one of these things that you to you oh uh you owe it to love one another because to love one another is fulfilling the law that love works no evil or malice towards his neighbor that in doing that you are not compromising and cannot compromise the word of God in loving your neighbor because if you compromise the word of God to love you have not loved your neighbor and so there's a lot of things that we could say it is not there's maybe a lot of things we could say it is but when it says to love your neighbor it says nothing about your neighbor's response it says nothing about how the world feels when it says do good to them which hate you and love your enemies the way that we love them it says nothing about the world's response it says nothing about their pinion but that loving doing God's will is never cruel or never violent I had it I think maybe it might be in my notes for next Wednesday where Paul when he's standing up in Acts 2 24 he says I've been here several days and you don't see me causing a revolt right I'm not in the temple causing trouble I'm not out trying to stir stuff up I'm not trying to start a a coup or a revolt because keeping God's word does not enjoying us to ever be cruel or violent so if I with that I I kind of want to just take a step further and it connects back to keeping his Commandments perfect love is not subjection by fear or by force because this perfect love is not owed in the sense of debt that we might think it was or poverty when we love God it says and we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous in other words when we love God our desire is to guard and to take care of his word when we love God our joy is to fulfill his word so our our action is willingly given it's not this task that says well if you love God um you'll go to church and how many people go to church with this idea that somehow by going they love God when they're only going because they take attendance they're only going because they don't want to prove themselves to be a fraud by not going I think I said it in the very beginning that I never wanted to create a culture in this church where people go to be seen or they go because they don't want people thinking what's wrong with them they're not there and hey if it creates the kind of culture where it's easy for people not to go to church I get it that's maybe the downside but it's so much better when everyone there wants to be there can I get a witness whoa right it's so much better when the people are there there because they love God and that's when you have a beautiful Feast of Charity when we're yeah it was hard to be here and yeah maybe there's other things to do and and I had to claw my way through hell it seemed to get here but I want to be here why do you want to be here well if I'm not there I'm not a Christian no I'm there because I love God I'm there because there's benefits I get from I'm there because I love the people of God and I recognize that my presence there is also a benefit to somebody else that's why they I guess I think I've joked about it here that when you go to church on Sunday morning you you you love church you go on Sunday evening you love your pastor and that's why we don't have a Sunday evening service and if you go on Wednesday nights it's because you love the word and the truth is That's why you should be there anytime when the doors are open when you're a Christian and you want to be there because the doors are open it's love that does that Islam that drives you to do it it's something willingly given it's a desire to keep his word it's a desire to guard it and I hope that as we are kind of wrapping this up here soon that it there's a a depth to that where it's not just the Bible says to do this okay I'm going to do it but there's something that quickens you to be like wow yeah I get it don't you all that are here tonight get why this being at church on Wednesday night's important that's why you're here you really this isn't just a worthless exercise when I see families that drive uh long distances to be here on a Wednesday night they're not just doing it because they're earning miles right there's no executive Platinum level they're going to get lean into sometime in July they're doing it because they recognize the value and benefit of it and why God makes it available and why God asks for them to do it now if I could say maybe I'm trying to find the right words to say this to love God and perfect love is not subjection it's not bondage by force or fear it's not necessarily to keep his word is not necessarily what love demands but it is what it does when it's perfected it's not so much that well it's demanded but it's what it does when it's perfected because when we come back to perfect love cast out fear it's when you do what when you willingly and by Desire by love want to keep God's word and do what his word ask you it's because you trust his will you trust him that you trust that what he's asking you to do that even if it's not perfectly understood love desires to keep the word that you recognize that you know what I may not understand all the consequences or implication I may not understand perfectly why I'm being asked to do this but there's something inside of you that recognizes this is the word of God and God has purpose he has intent he has meaning behind it and therefore I desire to keep it because I know that God means well it comes back to even how Jesus expresses if any one of you if your son would ask you for bread would you give him a stone because even in that there's this trust and there's this understanding it love trust the desire or the Need Love wants to meet the need what love wants to remove all the berries and all the obstructions and so when we love God it's not that we have to completely figure it out but there's a part of us that trust what he's asking us to do so second John 1 6 and this is love that we walk after his Commandments this is the Commandment that as you have heard from the beginning you should walk in it and let me emphasize this love is the gift of God it's not something that we must find ourselves and find within ourselves first and then bring to him as a debt that if I love God I'll keep his commandments so I got to First find that I love him and then bring it to him as if I owe it to him or bring it to him as if it's a debt this love is a gift it's not something you're going to find within yourself first and then present to him as if you owed it to him but it is it is a gift of God and John is not saying that love is a task or love is a chore but love has a nature love has an Evidence this is the love of God that you keep his Commandments and it's not a it's not violence to you it's not trouble it's not severe this isn't slavery this is this is something you're voluntarily and willing to do because of love because it's this is how love manifests itself now if you've had the if you've had if you've thought about this statement then then we're on the same kind of the same level in the same wavelength if you hadn't I think this might kind of shove something into view that's going to be very thought provoking because God loves us and we know he does because he told us and because he sent his son to die for us he manifested it he he loved us initially by having love for us and then he projected love to us in action by sending his son to die for us and that's how we know and can perceive the love of God so herein we know the love of God because he told us and he proved it and then the question is well how shall I prove my love to him how is it that I love him by keeping his Commandments right and his Commandments are not Grievous to me how do I keep his how do I keep I shall prove my love to him I know that I love the children of God when I love God and keep his Commandments how do I prove his love how do I prove my love to him how do I show that I love him by loving one another because loving is fulfilling the law all these things begin to line up and then notice how brother Branham says it in the church age book and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and then this this remarkable phrase and by conducting myself with joy admits the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass that's a hard thing I have failed this time and time again I prove my love it's the manifestation of his love in my life when I can conduct myself above my trials it's the proof of my love to him when I trust him whenever I'm going through that we could say this that if and and maybe maybe it's best left for the some of these future services but if God allows something to happen his word tells me that that must be material that God can use for good because all things work together for the good that that there has to be something about the love of God to where he has his his thoughts about me what he's a plan for me he has a predestinated objective for me as the object of his love he's going to bring me to Perfection and that Perfection changes where I'm at presently but not only does it change where I'm at presently it redeems my past because love reaches back and says I can use that I can use that I can use that I can use that no matter what it is because the Bible says he works all things together for the good to them that love God so my if I love him it tells me that my past is material that God can use for good and so conducting myself with joy in the midst of the trials which he and his wisdom allows to come to pass that I would say that's when love would pay off right that's Love's payoff but isn't it hard isn't it hard to do it's difficult we've been trying to approach these scriptures from the standpoint to where we don't create a litmus test to say ah well if you fear you don't have love but says no that's what Love's for and I will say this that I know for myself my some of my biggest regrets have to do it the way not because the trial I went through but the way I conducted myself in the midst of it and I believe there may have been a time in my life where I wrestled with God's will when it comes to the trial and there's things that we'll face in life very terrible things very horrible gut-wrenching things and unfaithfulness and sin and and things that we know are pure evil and you'll face it you'll and you'll wrestle with whether or not it's God's will when you say it's contrary to God's will in his word that one would do that but if it's happening to you you have to believe that God can work all things together for the good and then the part that I had to learn is that even in the face of things that clearly to me would be unfaithful and against God's word that if he allows it to come to pass it's his wisdom that has allowed it and that you do not have to wrestle with whether or not this is a trial that God under wisdom allowed to come to pass because there's no way that you could ever say aha this is a trial that God in his wisdom did not allow in his wisdom this one got by God right so if you're going through a trial it means his wisdom let it through all the trials are lining up they're all just kind of lining up trying to get you can I get some can I get them I'm here can I get to him can I get to him I want to get to him I want to cause financial trouble I want to ruin their marriage can I get to him can I get to him they're all trying to get in there and God is wisdom is saying no you can go but you can his wisdom has allowed it to come so no matter what it is if you're going through it his wisdom has allowed it to come to pass so it's in that moment at a time I must conduct myself for Joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass now joyful conduct I want you to think about it in terms of there's a there's a true joyful conduct and then there's the one we think of right that when we're going through it it just means kind of skipping along and happy and so how are you doing brother oh you won't believe it guess what everything's falling apart everything's burning at this very moment and I'm just Tickle Pink I mean this guy's an arsonist right he set it on fire he must have got an insurance policy why is this guy well no this is Joy uh it could be delusion you could be you could be completely uh not con you know grasping the situation but there's a Godly sorrow I want to look at this in scripture there's a Godly song There's a worldly sorrow so there's a Godly joy and there's a worldly Joy Paul said in a way that's caused called heresy he served the Lord in a way that against acceptable conduct and the way it's against uh acceptable opinion and the way that I call heresy in other words there's an accepted reality there's an accepted truth and you're worshiping God in a way that's not accepted so to conduct ourselves with joy may be in a way that's not acceptable to the world it may be in a way that's contrary to popular opinion so as we think about this in second Corinthians 7 10 it says for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death if you have time go back and reread this chapter chapter seven for that before next Wednesday or maybe in preparation for the service Godly sorrow Works repentance but there's a worldly saw that worketh death so there's a counterpart if there's a Godly sorrow and a worldly sorrow there's a Godly joy and a worldly Joy first Thessalonians 4 13 but I would not have you be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope isn't this what we remind ourselves of when we see a loved one pass away and a Christian pass away as we say look as Christians we don't cry like the world cries we don't grieve like the world Grieves yes we grieve yes we sorrow Sorrowing and grieving is an act of praise and it's okay to Saul it's okay to grief but we don't do it like the world it's not tormenting it doesn't Rob us of our peace in Christ that there's a type of grieving and mulling over something and turning it over and turning over they'll lead you to questioning God and lead you to abandon your faith and lead you to despondency and depression but there's a way that you can grieve in a Godly way as there's Godly sorrow that leads to repentance in a worldly Saul that leads to death we don't sorrow like the world as those that do not have hope so there's a worldly joy and there's a Godly Joy I want to conduct myself with Godly Joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass if I could say our say this our conduct During trials are different than the worldly response I read this this is in a letter that brother Vincent van Gogh wrote in a letter to Theo in 1877 but it struck me and it was in reading some of these letters that inspired me actually on the series on perfect love I know some of you may only know Van Gogh in his end but listen to what he writes he says there is something better than the glory of worldly things it is the feeling when our hearts burn within us on hearing the word that is faith in God love for Christ belief in more immoral in immortality in a life after this life there's something better than the glory of worldly things and he said what is it it's the feeling in our hearts that burn within us on hearing his word and what is it that's faith in God love for Christ it's belief in immortality what is it that's burning in our hearts as Christians when we hear the word of God it's eternity it's life after it's life beyond this life sometimes we say life after this life and we think in this chronology in the sense that once this Earth is over everything's gone and we slip into heaven or we slip into hell but it's life beyond this life it's real life now there's a real life and he says there's something better than the glory of worldly things there's something better than the joy of worldly things there's something better than the happiness this world brings it's the feeling in our hearts burning within us when we hear the word what is it that is faith in God and love for Christ so when brother Branham says conduct myself with joy it's different than worldly happiness and if you hadn't kind of already figured out what I where I'm leading with this this joyful conduct is keeping the word it has to be because how is it that we prove our love for him by keeping his Commandments how else can we conduct ourselves a joy unless we're keeping his word third John verse 4 says I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in truth There's No Greater Joy has anyone ever said to you and I don't mind if you give a hearty amen or throw your hand in the air unless maybe the person who said it here is here and you you want to be a little bit discreet and you could just kind of do that that one you do but has anyone ever said to you well I hope you're happy anybody okay thank you and you knew they didn't mean it well I hope you're happy I hope you just have the time of your life they don't really mean it what there's no real it's it's this sarcastic kind of Catty thing well I hope you're happy and and there's hatred behind it and and I believe that as Christians we can be sincere when someone stares truth in the face and leaves it and says they're happier and I believe the love of God can say in our hearts well I'm happy for you and I'm glad you're happy but I would have no Greater Joy than to see you walk in truth that's not incompatible I know maybe it's kind of late all of a sudden open up that box but I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children rocked in truth I could say as a father that I do desire above all that my children would walk in truth and that I believe is by election and so maybe second to that I want them to be happy I don't want them to be full of anxiety I want I don't want them to be despondent I don't want them to be troubled I don't want them to live their lives in fear and bound by complexes I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in truth and as this relates to conducting myself with joy and that joyful conduct is doing God's will because there's no Greater Joy than children walking truth why because they'll find no greater happiness than walking in truth so my joy is commiserate with their Joy they will find no greater satisfaction you cannot find any I could say and I testify tonight and I know that I'm not alone but I say this to young people and to strangers There Is No Greater Joy in this world than loving God There's No Greater Joy than walking in truth and when you love somebody somebody you want that forum and in John chapter 13 verse 17 after Jesus has given the Commandments to wash one another's feet he says if you know these things happy re if you do them now I feel like such a rookie preacher to try to close on this because now we've just we've been hammering against something and now it's just it's just opened up and we're all going to be like okay now we need to stick around for a while or maybe it's just me but if you know these things happy are you if you do them this knowledge is not like the world intellectual faith produces anxiety and misery in doing people who have tried to serve God and serve the message and fulfill the word of God through intellectual Faith find themselves bound with anxiety bound with fear bound that depression bound with so many uh hatred bitterness those that have tried to subject others through their intellectual Faith have sown into people fear left a bad taste in their mouth according to the word of God because the Bible says if you know these things happy or if you do them but this knowledge is beyond if you read it do it doesn't mean if you know it in terms of the Bible says to do this but this no here is is deeper than that remember I said religion in church becomes very unsafe when we lose the love side of the love of God this is how religion becomes so unsafe when it becomes Dogma when it demands obedience by Authority and not love when it demands your obedience by Authority not by revelation come on it's when that it's when the word is presented that way as dogma and we're forced to obey it that's why we're not happy in doing because the knowledge that's spoken of here look at verse 7. verse 17 if you know these things happy are you if you do them and he's not just saying did you hear me say it then do it and you'll be happy he says if you know it he says in verse 7 Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter and he's not just meaning after I say it what I'm about to do and what I'm doing now you will understand from a semantic standpoint you'll understand from a logistics standpoint they said they're going okay you took a towel you washed the feet how hard is this to duplicate right how hard is it to do this when it all I have to do is say you have to just get a basin wash one another's feet and we're happy if we do it he said no he says you're not going to know it once I've done it you're going to know hereafter when the Holy Spirit reveals to you the purpose when that which is the spirit of truth comes when the when the comforter comes and reveals to you the meaning When Love is the keeping and not just in obeying because he says if you know these things the word they're no is the same cannot see the kingdom of God in other words if you understand these things not if you just know it but if you understand it if you see it in a sense of understanding this is the happiness only true love can bring because you know it's connected with a deeper purpose because the keeping of it is born from love and not bondage and not Duty and not obligation and not not an injury or fear the keeping of it is comes from revelation if you know these things happy are if you do them I want to say it's when knowledge comes by revelation and brother Brahm says Satan hates Revelation but we love it he said he don't like it at all because it upsets his plans in other words there's a lot that he wouldn't he doesn't mind if you do it by the letter but he hates it when you do it by love he hates it when you do it by revelation and he says I have this is how I conduct conduct myself with joy admit in the admits the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass is if I do the word of God and I'm keeping the word of God that he's revealed to me brother Branham in Christ is the mystery God revealed musicians you could come now he uses the definition from Webster's Dictionary on Revelation it's an act of revealing or communicating Divine truth Revelation is an act of love it's how God gives Joy to the loved it's a stimulation of Revelation that when I'm going through a trial and I'm going through a difficulty I'll find my joy in the revelation of God's word in this statement where brother Graham says it what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church Whispering secrets to her in the midst of the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass that's how I can conduct myself with Joy by staying ever connected to the word of God because God is his word and God is love the word will never pass away his love will never pass away and he that keeps the word he too shall never pass away because he's the object of God's love and that love is eternal therefore the love is eternal I hope he opens up another dimension I could say this that it's during those times of grieving times a struggle times a trial when nothing seems to be going right if I could say this I hope this resonates in in a Discerning way you'll find that worldly things are much easier to achieve when things are going bad much easier than keeping the word of God you say oh well things are rough I I can't exercise and I don't eat right and I don't get out and do mow the lawn and for those who live somewhere else and I I I there's all these things that I don't do when I'm going through a tough time and and I say and it may not be easy to do any one of those but you know what's even harder is to keep the word of God to conduct yourself with joy I implore you that in the hard times in the tough times in the weak times stay connected with the stimulation of Revelation do the things you know are right comes back to the very thing that I think that inspired this series in the beginning as I was praying last year about God would want me to minister to the church and what is needful and how he looked at what I know God's will for me this year there's things that we should never lose sight of that we ought to be doing and why is it that one of the first things we stop doing when we go through a hard time is we stop serving one another you stop loving one another it's because those are the things that Satan hates but I encourage you to know deeper no deeper no deeper what love have it loves evidence is [Music]
