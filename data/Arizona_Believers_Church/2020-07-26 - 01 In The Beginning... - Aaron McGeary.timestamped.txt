[0:00] and here in genesis chapter 1 verses 1
[0:02] to 5 it says in the beginning god
[0:04] created the heaven and the earth and the
[0:07] earth was without
[0:08] form and void and darkness was upon the
[0:11] face of the deep
[0:12] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[0:14] face of the waters
[0:16] and god said let there be light and
[0:17] there was light and god saw the light
[0:20] that it was good
[0:21] and god divided the light from the
[0:23] darkness and god
[0:24] called the light day and the darkness he
[0:27] called night
[0:28] in the evening and the morning were the
[0:30] first day
[0:32] and then i'd like to read also in john
[0:33] chapter one
[0:35] i've been looking at the phrase in the
[0:36] beginning and how that there's different
[0:39] uh references in scripture to the
[0:41] beginning of things
[0:42] i even uh not to address it this morning
[0:45] but even it speaks it
[0:46] when the in the address to the laodicean
[0:48] church age it refers to jesus christ
[0:50] as the beginning of the creation of god
[0:52] and there's such a beautiful mystery
[0:54] contained in that and here john chapter
[0:57] 1 verses 1 to 3
[0:59] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:01] word was with god
[1:02] and the word was god you can see just
[1:05] how genesis begins within the beginning
[1:07] now john beginning
[1:08] in the beginning was the word verse 2
[1:10] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:13] all things were made by him and without
[1:15] him was not anything made
[1:17] that was made let's just bow our heads
[1:19] in a word of prayer gracious heavenly
[1:21] father
[1:22] lord we thank you that we're together
[1:23] today we thank you that we have a hunger
[1:26] and our hearts for your word for that's
[1:28] been placed there by you
[1:29] and lord if there's a deep in our hearts
[1:32] crying out we know there's a deep to
[1:33] respond
[1:34] so i pray that you respond to the deep
[1:36] that's in the people's hearts today
[1:38] lord that you administer to them in a
[1:40] way that encourages them
[1:42] lord we look beyond these four walls
[1:44] today and we see a lot of uncertainty
[1:46] we see unrest we see hurt lord we see we
[1:49] see pain
[1:50] we see even anger and frustration
[1:53] and we see those that are sick and and a
[1:56] plague that has even gone around the
[1:57] world and social
[1:59] conditions that are very unstable but
[2:01] father what has drawn us today is your
[2:03] word
[2:04] what has our attention is your word and
[2:06] we know that it's your
[2:08] word that's the solution and the answer
[2:10] to everything outside these four walls
[2:12] so we give it preeminence today and we
[2:14] ask that you come break the bread of
[2:15] life to us as only you can
[2:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[2:19] pray amen
[2:21] you may be seated
[2:24] now having us uh a short song service
[2:27] isn't a trick to be able to preach
[2:28] longer
[2:29] but we uh we do feel that the word
[2:32] should have
[2:33] the the preeminence in the first place
[2:36] and
[2:36] with the different settings that we're
[2:40] having to recognize and honor with the
[2:42] conditions and even the requirements of
[2:44] the state and the city
[2:45] and the county we felt it would just be
[2:47] best maybe to have an abbreviated song
[2:49] service and
[2:50] and get right into the word i i want to
[2:53] give you the title of this it's in the
[2:55] beginning
[2:56] and if the lord would lead perhaps
[2:58] there'd be more services to
[2:59] express this thought but in the
[3:01] beginning is my title
[3:03] and i just want to start with genesis
[3:05] chapter 1 verse 1 again it says in the
[3:08] beginning
[3:09] god created the heaven and the earth
[3:12] and this is the phrase in the beginning
[3:15] is actually just one word in the hebrew
[3:17] but in the english it is these three
[3:19] words in
[3:20] the beginning and in the hebrew the
[3:23] beginning and what's
[3:24] being referred to in reference to
[3:25] something that is first
[3:27] it's even used to refer to something
[3:29] that is the best or the chief
[3:30] or even the choice part of something in
[3:32] the beginning the first
[3:34] even in our language it would be the
[3:36] time when something begins in the
[3:38] beginning it's the time when something
[3:40] has started or the act of starting
[3:42] something
[3:43] and as i pondered this it's very
[3:45] difficult even as a subject to know
[3:47] where to start and even as i pondered it
[3:49] where this phrase fits within the the
[3:51] plan of redemption and the story
[3:54] of god redeeming the earth and you
[3:57] you must start somewhere when telling a
[3:58] story and
[4:00] and we all likely usually we're going to
[4:02] tell a story we'll begin maybe
[4:03] chronologically and
[4:04] i went on a vacation and i left on this
[4:06] date and we begin to tell it in order
[4:09] and it is when god begins to tell this
[4:11] story he starts here with genesis in the
[4:14] beginning
[4:15] but this is not the beginning of god
[4:18] when he says in the beginning this isn't
[4:19] just all of a sudden there's nothing
[4:21] then there's something
[4:22] because god was before the beginning it
[4:24] says in the beginning
[4:26] god so we know that god was already
[4:28] there when this beginning starts or when
[4:30] he this
[4:31] this act starts something and elohim is
[4:33] the word that's used for god and that
[4:35] means the one
[4:36] who exists by himself and john gives us
[4:39] a little bit of a
[4:40] better understanding of who this one is
[4:42] it says in the beginning was the word
[4:44] and the word was with god and the word
[4:46] was god so in the beginning was the word
[4:49] in the beginning was elohim the one who
[4:51] existed by himself
[4:53] and even that that thought is difficult
[4:56] for us to grasp
[4:57] because if i said that brother john was
[4:59] alone by himself
[5:01] we would picture him within space with
[5:04] distance and time and
[5:05] how long were you by yourself and where
[5:08] were you and
[5:08] where was the closest person and you say
[5:10] i'm in the middle of nowhere i'm all by
[5:12] myself and
[5:13] no one else is here we still think in
[5:15] terms of light time and matter and we
[5:17] picture him
[5:18] within a space and nobody else around
[5:21] but when god was before the beginning
[5:23] there was no space there was no time
[5:25] there was no matter
[5:26] it was just god so existence was god
[5:30] god was the only existence and so he was
[5:32] one who existed
[5:34] he's the iem as the scripture tells us
[5:36] and in psalms 90 verse
[5:38] 2 it says before the mountains were
[5:39] brought forth or ever thou
[5:41] had formed the earth and the world
[5:44] even from everlasting to everlasting
[5:47] thou
[5:48] art god that's psalms 90 verse 2 before
[5:51] the mountains were brought forth before
[5:52] the earth was formed
[5:54] from everlasting to everlasting thou art
[5:56] god is saying before the beginning after
[5:58] the beginning
[5:59] you are you always will be thou art god
[6:02] so it's not once the earth was created
[6:05] or
[6:06] that god is becomes into existence but
[6:08] there was elohim
[6:09] before there even was time brother
[6:12] abraham says god
[6:13] covers all space and fills all time and
[6:16] runs into eternity
[6:18] and so eternity has no beginning it has
[6:20] no end so
[6:21] when this time begins god runs into this
[6:24] time
[6:25] and then he fills all time and space and
[6:27] then when it all ends it runs right back
[6:29] into eternity
[6:31] in genesis chapter 2 verse 4 it says
[6:33] these are the generations
[6:35] of the heavens and of the earth and you
[6:37] see how that connects with genesis 1
[6:39] 1 these are the generations of the
[6:41] heavens and of the earth
[6:42] when they were created so heavens and
[6:44] earth were created
[6:45] by god in the day that the lord god
[6:48] made the earth and the heavens so it's
[6:51] the lord god
[6:52] he's described here as the lord god who
[6:54] made the earth and the heavens and lord
[6:56] is jehovah
[6:58] god is elohim and so jehovah it means
[7:01] the self-existent
[7:02] one it's adanahi which comes from havard
[7:06] and havan means to become it means to
[7:09] exist to become known and what and it
[7:11] says he's called the
[7:12] jehovah god a jehovah elohim he's
[7:15] continually becoming
[7:17] because you have a god that exists but
[7:19] nobody knows him
[7:21] there's nobody else with him there's not
[7:22] even a room that he inhabits there's not
[7:25] even space that he can
[7:26] travel he is just there all by himself
[7:29] and so but he has a characteristic he's
[7:31] known as
[7:32] lord god jehovah god adanahi which
[7:35] comes from this root to become or to
[7:36] exist so he's continually
[7:38] becoming he's a god that is un that
[7:41] unveils himself it is the unveiling of
[7:43] himself
[7:44] in romans chapter 1 verse 20 says for
[7:47] the invisible things of him
[7:49] romans chapter 1 verse 20 the invisible
[7:52] things of him
[7:53] from the creation of the world are
[7:55] clearly seen
[7:56] being understood by the things that are
[7:58] made even his eternal power
[8:01] and godhead so the invisible god becomes
[8:04] known for what he creates and he this is
[8:08] this is then the becoming god he's once
[8:10] invisible
[8:11] he's once not known there's not even
[8:13] space that he inhabits
[8:14] but now this uh lord god this jehovah
[8:17] this one that exists by himself
[8:19] he then is going to unveil himself and
[8:22] become known
[8:23] so he is the invisible self-existent one
[8:25] who reveals himself
[8:27] and that's important to understand that
[8:29] that's the nature of god
[8:30] is he desires to express himself and to
[8:33] make himself known
[8:35] and brother bam says this in christ is
[8:36] that christ is revealed in his own word
[8:39] he says the entire bible is the entire
[8:41] revelation of jesus christ
[8:43] making himself known to every age so
[8:46] when we read here in genesis 1
[8:48] we see that jesus christ is being made
[8:50] known when we read in john chapter 1
[8:52] jesus christ is being made known
[8:54] he says he made himself known in the
[8:56] days of luther as a foundation the
[8:58] church the foot the legs
[8:59] like he did to king nebuchadnezzar you
[9:01] remember how he dreamed those dreams and
[9:03] come from the head down
[9:04] see now he comes from the feet up in the
[9:08] babylonian kingdom he showed all those
[9:09] old testaments he come from the head
[9:11] down
[9:12] until he come down till god himself
[9:15] became flesh
[9:16] at the foot of the ladder this is
[9:18] brother branham giving quite
[9:19] an interesting perspective how it's in
[9:21] the old testament it's god consending
[9:23] down and god coming down
[9:25] and then he says before he comes to the
[9:26] foot of the ladder and we can see that
[9:28] this is god who in the beginning was the
[9:30] word
[9:31] and then it's god who's invisible who
[9:33] unfolds himself down
[9:34] all the way to where he's made flesh in
[9:36] his son jesus christ
[9:37] and that's the becoming god all the way
[9:40] down through this time
[9:41] to now he's at the foot of the ladder in
[9:42] the flesh of his son jesus
[9:44] and then he turns it around and this is
[9:46] very beautiful now here in the new
[9:48] testament he brings himself right back
[9:50] up again to the head again the head of
[9:52] gold to be crowned
[9:53] so god was in the beginning and he kept
[9:56] coming down
[9:58] through the prophets and on down until
[10:00] god himself became human like us
[10:02] plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a
[10:04] baby born in a manger
[10:06] hated rejected despised in a bad name in
[10:09] everything he was
[10:10] and that's a remarkable way of
[10:12] describing it because you picture the
[10:13] god of heaven
[10:14] who begins all by himself and then he
[10:18] and we know kind of the backstory to
[10:19] this in the beginning was the word so
[10:21] there is a point where this god forms
[10:25] himself into a logos
[10:26] it's a theophany body and he from that
[10:29] he begins to create
[10:31] it's in that form that he can become god
[10:33] had god just created something
[10:35] here's the invisible god who creates
[10:37] something and it would be like
[10:38] uh what what's going on here i just i
[10:42] just got here
[10:43] uh what am i doing here so god has to
[10:45] form even a being
[10:46] that one's angels has created becomes
[10:48] god because he's not god until he's
[10:50] worshipped and we know the message
[10:52] teaches us things
[10:53] very plainly to understand this and so
[10:56] brother branham is saying that this
[10:57] one who was omniscient all powerful
[11:00] unseen invisible has now come from being
[11:03] the preeminent one who exists by himself
[11:06] this
[11:06] this mighty god bound by an oath down to
[11:09] a baby in a manger
[11:11] and this was the becoming god because
[11:13] when he creates adam
[11:14] or when he forms the logos and then
[11:16] creates angels he's worshipped as god
[11:18] when he creates adam this is a mature
[11:20] male there in the garden with the female
[11:22] in him
[11:22] but when he gets down to the foot of the
[11:24] ladder he's a baby born in the manger
[11:26] a baby that's probably already got
[11:28] rumors swirling around about its origin
[11:29] a baby that's already
[11:31] in an uncertain time not even born in a
[11:33] proper setting
[11:34] but that's the way that god brought him
[11:36] forth he's there at the foot of the
[11:37] ladder
[11:38] and then brother bram says then he
[11:41] started rising
[11:42] and from the feet he began to build the
[11:45] bride
[11:45] oh isn't that wonderful to think that
[11:47] this is what he came down to
[11:49] and then now that he's at the feet when
[11:51] he begins to rise he's not necessarily
[11:53] bringing himself back up but he's
[11:55] bringing a bride up
[11:57] because we know and i feel that i'm
[11:59] preaching to very mature believers today
[12:01] and so in my mind i kind of think of a
[12:04] in
[12:05] a way that a subject matter unfolds i
[12:06] think well we can bring in at another
[12:08] time
[12:09] how that in this invisible god was one
[12:11] singular purpose
[12:13] the heart purpose of god was to have a
[12:14] bride of his choosing
[12:16] and so when brother brahm says he
[12:17] started to rise he began to build the
[12:19] church the bride
[12:20] when he begins to rise back up it's not
[12:22] so much a resurrection
[12:24] of himself as much as it is an
[12:26] expression of himself in bright form
[12:28] because that's what his desire was all
[12:30] along so once he had achieved
[12:32] christ now he wants to achieve the bride
[12:35] bride to christ and so now it's coming
[12:37] back he says on back
[12:39] and now coming out into the headstone
[12:41] where it all joins together and makes
[12:43] the one
[12:44] great transfigured body of jesus christ
[12:47] which is what you are my that's
[12:49] wonderful i just feel so much
[12:52] of a blessing in reading that that you
[12:54] just feel like if we stopped there we
[12:56] could say it's good to been in the house
[12:57] of the lord
[12:58] and i'm glad that not none of you are
[13:01] saying well that's just a good stopping
[13:02] point brother aaron
[13:04] let's go see what they have at the
[13:05] breakfast
[13:07] but you could just see a beautiful
[13:09] picture in this as brother branham
[13:10] describes that
[13:12] now gen even the word genesis as we read
[13:15] in genesis chapter one genesis in the
[13:17] latin means generation or nativity so
[13:20] it's the the
[13:20] the generation of something nativity of
[13:22] something and
[13:24] in the greek and it comes from the this
[13:26] even in the latin it comes from greek
[13:27] which means origin or creation
[13:29] or again generation and its root is from
[13:32] the word the greek word which means to
[13:34] be born
[13:35] so genesis refers to something being
[13:37] born it's related to genos which is
[13:39] race or to birth or to beget and the
[13:42] very root of all these words and the
[13:43] very root of genesis
[13:44] is gene so it speaks of the source of
[13:47] something
[13:48] the origin or something and we know that
[13:50] it speaks gene speaks of a seed
[13:52] and then in a seed there's dna there's
[13:54] instructions everything
[13:56] that that that is everything that any a
[13:58] plant is going to become
[14:00] is in the germ is in the seed and so you
[14:03] may look at a
[14:04] you may look at an apple tree and you
[14:05] may see it full of apples or more
[14:06] appropriately here in the valley of
[14:08] citrus tree
[14:09] and you look at that citrus tree and it
[14:11] began with the seed
[14:13] just one seed but every orange that's
[14:15] going to be on that tree was in that
[14:17] seed
[14:18] now that's hard to get your head around
[14:19] that but every every orange that's ever
[14:22] going to be on that citrus tree is in
[14:24] that one seed that's planted
[14:26] and brother berry coffee has a saying
[14:27] that anybody can count the apples that's
[14:29] on a tree
[14:30] but god can count the apples that's in
[14:32] the seed and because it's in there it's
[14:34] programmed in that
[14:36] and just to share a story that really
[14:38] really blessed me
[14:40] we were renting a home in north carolina
[14:42] and pray for us we're right now trying
[14:43] to find a place to live in phoenix and
[14:45] my goodness
[14:45] i've never seen a hotter real estate
[14:47] market in my life
[14:49] but uh we we planted a little garden
[14:52] sister elizabeth planted some lettuce
[14:54] and some different things on
[14:55] one side of the house and she hey jack
[14:57] was there helping
[14:59] and she had planted a whole row of
[15:00] cucumbers and jack took a seed he said i
[15:03] want to plant a seed he took one little
[15:05] seed
[15:06] and he went to the front of the house
[15:07] where there's a rather large little
[15:08] flower bed there and he took that seed
[15:10] and he planted it
[15:11] almost right next to the concrete and he
[15:13] just planted that seed there
[15:16] and it's fast forward a few months and
[15:17] not one cucumber has grown on the one
[15:19] side of the house
[15:20] nothing ever came up but we've got a jar
[15:23] of homemade pickles that have come from
[15:26] that one
[15:27] little vine that grew out of the ground
[15:29] and even right now there's probably
[15:30] still
[15:31] two dozen blooms on it that overnight
[15:33] turn into a little cucumber
[15:35] and by the next day it's big enough to
[15:37] be pulled off
[15:38] and elizabeth pickles them and they've
[15:40] been absolutely uh wonderful to taste
[15:42] but what struck me elizabeth said that's
[15:44] the one that jack planted
[15:46] and i realized it was the faith of a
[15:49] five-year-old
[15:50] who was like mom we're planting
[15:51] cucumbers i want to plant one
[15:54] and by faith he took a seed and he went
[15:57] over and said
[15:58] you're a cucumber seed then i'm going to
[16:00] get cucumbers and he planted in the
[16:02] ground
[16:02] and it's the only one that came up and
[16:05] who knows it very well could have been
[16:07] the experience
[16:08] of sister elizabeth as a green thumb who
[16:09] knows like you know what there's not a
[16:10] left
[16:11] enough direct sunlight here those
[16:13] groundhogs keep eating all the lettuce
[16:15] it's probably not going to be able to
[16:16] come up this isn't the best place to
[16:17] plant cucumbers
[16:19] and so she had enough experience to
[16:20] think cucumbers may not work here
[16:22] but childlike faith to say if it's a
[16:25] cucumber seed then i'm going to get
[16:26] cucumbers
[16:27] and he planted it in the ground and it
[16:29] came forth and so in the same way that
[16:32] genesis
[16:33] refers to a gene or a seed then there's
[16:36] something in there
[16:37] to come forth and in the
[16:40] in the greek or even the greek
[16:43] translators who translated the book
[16:46] of the bible and translated it from
[16:48] hebrew they used genesis
[16:50] from the hebrew word bereshith which is
[16:52] one word bereshith
[16:54] but in the english it's three words in
[16:57] the beginning
[16:58] so in the in the hebrew there was just
[17:01] one word that started it all
[17:03] be rashed in the beginning it's the
[17:04] first word of the torah it's the first
[17:06] word of the bible
[17:07] when you would open the torah it says
[17:08] bereshef into the english it's in the
[17:11] beginning
[17:11] but in that it's now the gene that is
[17:14] coming forth
[17:15] there's a seed there's an origin and i
[17:18] read somewhere and studying this that
[17:19] how bearish that this word
[17:22] the the beta the word the uh it comes
[17:25] and beth
[17:26] is first in the in the bible and somehow
[17:28] the alpha
[17:30] is is is skipped over and there's some
[17:33] rich history within the
[17:35] rabbinical teaching on why this was so
[17:37] and i pawned it and i realized
[17:38] the alpha already was so the next was
[17:42] the beth
[17:42] because the alpha existed before time so
[17:45] when it says beverage
[17:46] you have the alpha the alpha you have
[17:47] god elohim and then the very next is the
[17:49] bearish sheth
[17:50] in the beginning was god
[17:54] and genesis it is the introductory
[17:56] chapter to god's story of expressing
[17:59] himself
[18:00] with the purpose of achieving a bride he
[18:02] had a purpose in doing what he was doing
[18:05] and i feel it's this purpose that we
[18:07] must always keep in mind
[18:09] otherwise even the story of redemption
[18:11] the story of salvation
[18:12] almost becomes arbitrary it seems even
[18:15] accidental
[18:15] and how that god created adam and eve
[18:18] like a kin and barbie doll and
[18:20] oh my i'm gonna have a nice little
[18:21] playhouse and all of a sudden the barbie
[18:23] gets out of hand and
[18:24] and ken follows along with it he's like
[18:26] oh no what do i do with my playground
[18:28] and he comes up with an idea to redeem
[18:30] things that's not it at all
[18:32] god wanted to have a bride of his
[18:34] choosing and actually places these
[18:36] people
[18:37] in the conditions and the situation all
[18:39] with it knowing that i have a whole plan
[18:42] to end up in the last days with this
[18:45] a bride of his choosing that loves him
[18:47] contrary to to opposition and despite
[18:49] weakness and difficulty
[18:51] that she's going to love him and love
[18:53] him for who he is the word
[18:55] and he knew that's what he wanted in the
[18:56] end and that's
[18:58] that's why things unfold the way they do
[19:00] it's not just arbitrary he says well
[19:02] i'm gonna punish you adam and i'm gonna
[19:03] punish you even i'm gonna punish the
[19:05] serpent
[19:06] and many times they only look at three
[19:08] that are punished in the judgment
[19:10] but the earth is also punished there's
[19:12] four that are punished and that god just
[19:14] says well then i'm gonna punish you all
[19:15] and i'll figure it out later
[19:17] it says i know what i'll do i'll bring a
[19:18] sacrifice but it was and then when i and
[19:20] then the idea the
[19:22] kind of the nominal teaching is i'll
[19:23] have a sacrifice and then those who
[19:26] accept them
[19:26] they can get back in and they can come
[19:28] back into salvation
[19:30] but it wasn't arbitrary to those who
[19:32] will believe and those who will accept
[19:34] them
[19:34] he gave a redeemer to redeem that which
[19:37] was in his heart in the beginning
[19:39] so his purpose the genesis as we read it
[19:42] it's a story
[19:42] an introductory chapter to god's story
[19:46] telling his own telling of him
[19:48] expressing himself
[19:49] for the purpose of having a bride and so
[19:52] it holds all the patterns
[19:53] it holds the types it foreshadows things
[19:56] it is the foundation
[19:57] and it holds the seeds of everything
[19:59] that will be
[20:01] and i'm gonna i'm gonna take my time
[20:02] just to emphasize this
[20:04] this morning in in the message of the
[20:06] hour and just go
[20:08] and just be patient and diligent to read
[20:10] a number of places so that we can
[20:12] establish
[20:13] in the beginning how what what the
[20:15] importance of this
[20:16] genos is this genesis of the bible
[20:18] because this is the beginning
[20:20] of god expressing himself because we
[20:22] wouldn't know him otherwise
[20:24] unless this book had been written now
[20:26] there was a brother ramp says that god's
[20:28] first bible was in the stars
[20:29] and where do we see the beginning of
[20:30] that we read about it in the bible and
[20:34] so
[20:34] brother branham says in the message why
[20:36] i am a holy roller
[20:37] he says in genesis was the seed chapter
[20:40] where all
[20:41] the seeds were sown everything that you
[20:44] find
[20:44] in the world today came out of genesis
[20:47] everything began
[20:48] back there in the beginning so he's
[20:50] saying everything
[20:52] that's why the bible said there's
[20:53] nothing new under the sun because god in
[20:54] the beginning put it all there
[20:56] now we know there's things that come
[20:58] forth and we'll touch on it here in a
[20:59] moment
[21:00] that began in this book that we see
[21:03] coming forth in genesis
[21:05] but that's a that's how satan's plan
[21:07] comes into picture
[21:09] so brother says it's just like sowing a
[21:11] crop if you watch what kind of seed you
[21:13] got
[21:14] no matter what it looks like when it's
[21:15] this high you'll have to see what it is
[21:18] what seed it is you'll have to see what
[21:20] it'll be when it comes to seed
[21:22] if it's wheat corn or whatever it is it
[21:24] might look like a weed
[21:25] but if it's a wheat down here in the
[21:27] bottom it'll produce a wheat up there
[21:29] it's just what it is and when i was
[21:32] uh weeding the flower gardens and i was
[21:35] pulling all the weeds out and all the
[21:36] grass and everything
[21:37] i happened upon this plant i didn't know
[21:39] what it was and it looked like a weed
[21:41] because it was right on top of the
[21:42] concrete and i didn't think it was
[21:43] anybody who was planting something
[21:45] would want to plant but it had a little
[21:46] bit of flowering to it i thought you
[21:48] know what i'll just leave it
[21:49] and sure enough it was that cucumber
[21:51] plant and i wouldn't have known it i
[21:53] wouldn't have known that it was
[21:54] cucumbers i just know well it has a bud
[21:56] on it maybe this is something
[21:57] that that was coming back up or maybe
[22:00] something there elizabeth plant and i
[22:01] left it alone and brother
[22:02] said you got to wait it may look like a
[22:04] weed but what was in the seed
[22:06] is going to come forth you can't judge
[22:09] it till it comes to fruit he says now we
[22:11] go back to genesis
[22:12] to find out everything and then he uses
[22:15] the example of babylon
[22:16] and how that even in the book of genesis
[22:19] you find the seeds of babylon
[22:21] and he and he shows how we come all the
[22:23] way over here into the book of
[22:24] revelation
[22:24] where it's in the end time and where
[22:26] babylon ends up he says see you see the
[22:28] seeds of babylon in genesis
[22:30] now we see the maturing and the it's a
[22:32] perfection of it but yet we see the
[22:34] perverseness of it
[22:35] in the book of revelation which is
[22:37] manifested in our day in our time
[22:39] you see the seeds in genesis you see the
[22:41] maturing and the expression in
[22:42] revelation
[22:43] we see it today it begin back then and
[22:46] then it comes to fruit and the time
[22:47] we're living and he uses that example
[22:49] he says but you've got to go back to the
[22:51] beginning to start
[22:52] everything and this is a statement that
[22:55] really struck me because i wanted just
[22:56] to use the statement in genesis was the
[22:58] seed chapter
[22:59] it just to show where i'm saying you go
[23:01] to go back to genesis to find everything
[23:03] go back to genesis to the beginning to
[23:04] start everything then he says this
[23:07] if the faith that was once delivered to
[23:09] the saints
[23:10] we got to go plumb back to the beginning
[23:12] to get it
[23:13] to find out what we're going to talk
[23:15] about so he says we're going to talk
[23:17] about the faith that was once delivered
[23:18] to the saints
[23:19] he said if you want to know the faith
[23:21] that's once delivered you've got to go
[23:22] back to the beginning to know what that
[23:24] faith is
[23:25] now in one sense we've got to go back to
[23:27] the day of pentecost to know that the
[23:28] faith that was once delivered
[23:30] but even then we'd have to go back to
[23:32] when christ was with the disciples to
[23:34] understand
[23:35] the faith that they had to be in the
[23:37] upper room and to receive the outpouring
[23:39] and then to understand even who christ
[23:41] is you'd have to go back to go back he's
[23:42] saying
[23:43] let's go all the way back to the
[23:45] beginning to know what this faith is
[23:47] that we're being restored back to
[23:49] because it's we it is not just a faith
[23:52] to hold us together
[23:53] uh uh and to keep a profession of faith
[23:56] until one day a minister stands over our
[23:58] casket
[23:58] and delivers a wonderful eulogy about
[24:00] how wonderful we were and how much we
[24:02] believed the message and
[24:03] how faithful we were to our children and
[24:05] how what a great guy
[24:06] we were what a great mother we were
[24:08] that's not the end game of this message
[24:11] and the faith that was once delivered to
[24:12] the saints
[24:13] the purpose of that faith is to defeat
[24:15] death that there'd be no more caskets
[24:17] for the elect there'd be no more burials
[24:19] for the believer
[24:20] and that one day one day we're going to
[24:22] have the last funeral for a believer
[24:25] one day the last bride member is going
[24:26] to be buried and there'll be no more
[24:28] gravesides there'll be no more funerals
[24:30] there'll be no more weeping but there's
[24:32] going to be a people who have the faith
[24:34] that was once delivered
[24:35] in his perfection be translated and meet
[24:37] the lord in the air
[24:39] that's the purpose of this he says you
[24:41] got to go back to the beginning to even
[24:42] understand that
[24:44] and then the message who do you say this
[24:46] is he's speaking about the foolish
[24:48] virgin
[24:49] and then he he likens he says that
[24:52] and it's uh it's i guess it's a very
[24:55] deep
[24:56] uh teaching that he's pointing it out
[24:57] because you think about my this is very
[24:59] staggering
[25:00] to understand the foolish virgin he
[25:02] looks at the the example of
[25:04] eve he said you have the fullest virgin
[25:06] but then you but you can go back and see
[25:08] in eve that she even played that part of
[25:11] this foolish virgin
[25:13] he says notice the woman here represents
[25:15] the future denominational church
[25:17] called bride not the bride but they call
[25:19] themselves bride
[25:20] the woman here represents the future
[25:22] denominational church called bride so he
[25:24] says the
[25:24] foolish virgin that can be typed by eve
[25:27] he says it's represented here
[25:29] and it's the future denominational
[25:30] church he says it all comes up in
[25:32] genesis
[25:33] it's a seed you start in genesis you'll
[25:35] get your picture straight
[25:37] so again in the beginning in genesis in
[25:39] this genos
[25:40] chapter in the c chapter he says it all
[25:43] come up in genesis
[25:45] and and the way that uh in the way that
[25:47] the the lord just uses the
[25:49] the burden that i have in my heart when
[25:51] i begin to look at a subject i just
[25:52] begin to see a road map like you could
[25:54] just preach on this forever
[25:56] because you could just start well let's
[25:57] just do genesis 1 1 and then just stay
[25:59] and you can stay on genesis 1 1 forever
[26:01] and then you're like well of course you
[26:02] can with this
[26:03] because it's the seeds of everything
[26:06] it's connected throughout because it's
[26:08] taking it would be like taking that
[26:10] little cucumber seed or that little
[26:12] citrus seed
[26:13] and then being able by revelation to
[26:15] describe
[26:16] and bring forth every orange that would
[26:18] hang on that tree
[26:20] every cucumber that's going to be
[26:21] pickled and just and bring it out
[26:24] in that setting because it's all right
[26:26] here he says you start in genesis
[26:28] it all come up in genesis as a seed
[26:31] he says an end time seed sign or end
[26:34] time sign
[26:35] seed he says as i was preaching
[26:37] yesterday on the seed
[26:38] it's the word all things begin in
[26:42] genesis
[26:43] because genesis means beginning or seed
[26:45] chapter of
[26:46] the bible everything we have on earth
[26:49] today
[26:49] the origination of it started in genesis
[26:52] and then he
[26:53] he he adds this part and i want you to
[26:57] catch it that it's not he's not changing
[26:59] what he's saying
[27:00] but he's showing that there was
[27:01] something that began also in genesis
[27:03] that wasn't part of the beginning that
[27:05] god sowed seed
[27:06] but then satan took that seed and hybrid
[27:09] it
[27:10] and when that happens it's no longer the
[27:11] original so it comes up in genesis
[27:14] but it wasn't in the beginning and
[27:16] that's where the
[27:17] um brother branham points back to in
[27:20] certain times you got to know what the
[27:21] original was
[27:22] what was the original spoken seat word c
[27:24] what was the original
[27:25] in the creation if it was an original
[27:27] attribute of god it never ends
[27:29] right as there's something brother jason
[27:31] watkins uh shared one time in fellowship
[27:33] it might just
[27:34] it just made everything connect for me
[27:36] in terms of the original attributes he
[27:38] said the earth
[27:39] the heavens and the earth were original
[27:41] spoken word attributes of god
[27:43] that's why in the new heavens and new
[27:44] earth they're not completely annihilated
[27:46] and destroyed and cast in the lake of
[27:48] fire but they're renovated why
[27:49] because god redeems his original
[27:51] attributes
[27:53] that's why we you are an original
[27:55] attribute your original gene you you
[27:56] have no beginning really you have you
[27:58] will
[27:58] have no end you will you you do not have
[28:01] to even in eternity you have a different
[28:04] uh uh promise because only the elect
[28:06] only the predestined are included in
[28:08] redemption
[28:09] but yet there's still others who are
[28:10] there in eternity
[28:12] who are preserved by the word of god but
[28:14] yet we have a different inheritance
[28:16] he says all things begin in genesis he
[28:18] says the origination of it
[28:20] started in genesis he says now we have
[28:22] things today
[28:23] that did not begin in genesis because
[28:25] it's been hybrid
[28:27] anything hybrid is a phony it's no good
[28:29] it cannot reproduce itself
[28:31] and anything that's hybrid is man-made
[28:33] and cannot bring itself
[28:35] back again now you could see just how
[28:39] expansive this is to begin to ponder
[28:41] what the original sin was
[28:42] the original sin wasn't serpent seed
[28:45] that's the result of the original sin
[28:47] the original sin is the hybrid god's
[28:49] original seed
[28:52] and he says this continuing in the same
[28:53] sermon therefore anything that wasn't
[28:55] spoken
[28:56] by god in the beginning is a hybrid and
[28:59] he's talking about how
[29:00] uh a mayor a mule and those things that
[29:02] can't breathe themselves back in and you
[29:04] just you breathe these things and
[29:06] and you breed the corn your hybrid corn
[29:08] and you show how you plant it it won't
[29:09] come up
[29:10] he says therefore anything that wasn't
[29:12] spoken by god in the beginning is a
[29:13] hybrid
[29:14] so you have something that's in the
[29:16] beginning by the spoken word
[29:18] then you have other things that follow
[29:20] in this seed chapter
[29:21] that are not part of the original and
[29:23] that gives you a test to be able to
[29:25] determine
[29:25] is this original or is it hybrid because
[29:28] if it's hybrid it won't produce the
[29:29] results
[29:30] that the original can he says that's the
[29:33] way
[29:34] that the people get away from the word
[29:35] of god it becomes a hybrid affair
[29:38] it must die it cannot bring forth of its
[29:41] kind to life again
[29:42] the church that will refuse to believe
[29:45] the word of god
[29:46] is a hybrid church with dogmas creeds
[29:49] doctrines that's not scriptural
[29:51] and i say this in my heart is
[29:54] starting even this this work today and
[29:58] this service together
[29:59] that the foundation must be the word
[30:03] the attraction must be the word what is
[30:05] lifted
[30:06] up must be the word he says church that
[30:08] refuses to believe the word of god is
[30:10] hybrid
[30:12] even as we have named this church
[30:14] arizona believer's church
[30:16] it's abc but everyone says never get
[30:19] away from your abc's
[30:20] always believe christ what is christ he
[30:23] is the word
[30:24] that's what these seals represent they
[30:26] represent christ the word
[30:27] so our what we must always be identified
[30:30] with
[30:31] is not personality not politics not
[30:33] pretense but it is the word that
[30:36] gathers us together it's you want to be
[30:38] a people that believe the word of god
[30:41] a church that does not believe the word
[30:43] of god is a hybrid church
[30:44] what you are are you are believers
[30:47] you're not identified with even one
[30:48] particular doctrine you're not
[30:50] identified with
[30:51] a particular way of worship or or a
[30:54] particular building i love the fact that
[30:55] we can start
[30:56] from scratch fresh not with any
[30:59] particular building or doctrine or
[31:00] personality or idea
[31:02] idea but say if you're hungry for the
[31:04] word of god if god calls you in your
[31:06] heart to the word
[31:06] then this is the word's gonna be what
[31:08] has preeminence
[31:11] and he says continuing the church cannot
[31:14] bring forth a spirit-filled child
[31:16] because it's hybrid it's no good he says
[31:19] it might be bigger
[31:20] great big walls fine pews big bells
[31:22] plush seats
[31:24] no pews not even a musician not even a
[31:28] song leader
[31:29] he says it might be bigger great big
[31:30] walls fine pews big bells plush seats
[31:33] but that doesn't mean one thing it's
[31:34] spiritually dead that's right
[31:36] it cannot bring forth spirit-filled
[31:38] children because it's dead itself
[31:41] now what is it that's going to bring
[31:42] forth spirit-filled children
[31:44] is it a is it a really dynamic song
[31:46] service
[31:48] is it is it a charismatic altar call no
[31:51] what's going to bring for spirit-filled
[31:53] children is
[31:54] is a belief in the word of god and even
[31:57] for that
[31:58] child unaware of its own election to
[32:01] be in an atmosphere where the word has
[32:03] preeminence
[32:04] and they believe that that word is for
[32:06] them
[32:07] and they come even if it isn't an altar
[32:10] call it's where the word has prince
[32:11] and it's the word that's pulled them
[32:13] brought them forth it's the word that
[32:15] meets them at the altar
[32:16] and it's a word birth that they
[32:17] experience in knowing him and
[32:19] forgiveness of sins
[32:21] it's the word that must have preemised
[32:24] in the message marriage and divorce
[32:25] brother branham makes this statement
[32:28] and he's addressing the subject of
[32:31] marriage
[32:32] and divorce and what he does is he uses
[32:35] jesus then they come to jesus and they
[32:37] ask him the question
[32:38] well why did moses give us a rid of
[32:40] divorce and he basically
[32:42] says well he did it for this reason and
[32:44] he did it for that reason
[32:46] but it wasn't so from the beginning so
[32:49] when he answers the question
[32:50] of marriage and divorce he points out
[32:53] he's pointing out to them that
[32:55] moses gave you the rid of divorce
[32:57] because of the fall of mankind
[33:00] so this writ of divorce and i'll just be
[33:02] very blunt he says because the hardness
[33:03] of your hearts
[33:04] so these men go up there well why did
[33:06] moses give us the permission to divorce
[33:07] our wives he says because you have hard
[33:09] hearts
[33:10] that's why he says but from the
[33:12] beginning it wasn't so because adam
[33:14] didn't have a hardened heart
[33:15] so he's showing that yeah that's the
[33:17] reason why he did it because of the
[33:18] condition of mankind
[33:19] says but from the beginning it wasn't so
[33:22] and he's showing
[33:24] when jesus wants to answer the question
[33:25] and get it straight he says yeah it may
[33:27] be this way now but if you want to know
[33:29] the real answer
[33:30] go back to the beginning so bravo
[33:32] answers the question
[33:33] the true answer that jesus wants us to
[33:35] go back to is to go back to the
[33:36] beginning
[33:38] then that would be in genesis because
[33:40] the word genesis is the seed chapter to
[33:43] every question
[33:44] in the bible and you always have to go
[33:46] back to the seed to see what kind of
[33:48] seed is in the field
[33:49] to find out what your crops will be now
[33:52] what kind of seed is sown
[33:54] genesis being the seed chapter we go
[33:56] back to genesis
[33:58] jesus introduces us to that script
[34:00] scripture at
[34:01] the beginning now remember and i think
[34:04] it may be in the book of mark where he
[34:06] says at the beginning
[34:08] he made a male and female and so i think
[34:10] in matthew then even in mark when he's
[34:12] answering this question he's referring
[34:14] it's phrased where they're going back to
[34:16] the beginning
[34:16] from the beginning he says at the
[34:18] beginning now remember that's when
[34:20] time started to begin before that it was
[34:23] eternity and brother branham in this
[34:27] message
[34:28] he he brings us to genesis 3 15 when the
[34:30] curse comes upon the serpent
[34:32] and when the curse comes upon the
[34:33] serpent what god has hid
[34:35] in the curse to the serpent is the seed
[34:38] of redemption and the mystery of
[34:39] redemption and a redeemer
[34:41] so in judgment to the serpent is
[34:42] actually a promise to the bride
[34:44] a promise of redemption and brethren
[34:46] says that ends the beginning
[34:49] so once you get to the curse to the
[34:51] serpent now he says that ends the
[34:53] beginning
[34:54] and now there's something different that
[34:56] has unfolded from there
[34:57] and this is the fallen creation this is
[34:59] the hybrid creation
[35:01] that's now intermingled with the the
[35:03] original creation
[35:04] and that from there it said that ends
[35:06] the beginning now something different
[35:07] has unfolded
[35:08] so he says he told you when time started
[35:10] to begin before that it was eternity
[35:13] so actually time is entered in now once
[35:15] the final judgment comes
[35:17] but before that there was only eternity
[35:20] that once death entered into the soul of
[35:21] eve
[35:22] it begins to fade away and now he says
[35:24] now it's time now you're only in time
[35:27] he says now our question there notice if
[35:28] we go back to the beginning
[35:30] now don't fail this and that's the
[35:32] reason i want to talk slow
[35:33] so that the people out on the wires and
[35:35] the tape will say say it clearly
[35:38] if jesus said go back to the beginning
[35:41] there was only one pair of anything on
[35:42] earth
[35:43] there was one adam one eve they were
[35:44] joined by god alone one female horse one
[35:47] male one female parrot one male
[35:48] at the beginning as he told us to go
[35:51] back there was only one pair of anything
[35:54] then we find out that everything in the
[35:56] beginning
[35:57] and this is i wanted to emphasize this
[35:59] everything in the beginning
[36:01] was running in perfect order in harmony
[36:04] with god
[36:06] in the beginning god created the heavens
[36:08] and the earth
[36:09] and he says everything was running in
[36:11] perfect order and harmony with god
[36:12] nothing was out of cater everything in
[36:15] heaven is still in order and all the
[36:16] stars the galaxies the solar system
[36:18] everything is perfectly in order so
[36:21] although there has been
[36:22] calamity on the earth because the woman
[36:24] got out of step
[36:26] but you look to the heavens and
[36:27] everything is timed perfectly
[36:29] they can even tell you when the last
[36:31] time this comment came by
[36:33] and the next time it will come by and
[36:35] they can even time it like
[36:37] go ahead and set your clock they can
[36:39] tell you when the next solar eclipse is
[36:41] going to be
[36:42] they they can plan all this out why it's
[36:44] perfectly timed
[36:46] perfectly set in order graham says it's
[36:48] still in continuity with god
[36:49] it's still in harmony with god the soul
[36:52] says everything still perfectly in order
[36:54] that's how that we even have with the
[36:56] rotation
[36:57] of the of the earth and its rotation
[37:00] around the sun
[37:02] it's perfectly we keep time by it
[37:05] we can plan these things but he says one
[37:08] of them moved it would interrupt the
[37:10] whole program
[37:12] maybe and greatest battle ever fought he
[37:14] talks about how if one of those stars
[37:15] was to get out the moon was to move its
[37:16] place the earth would be flooded in a
[37:18] moment
[37:19] one interruption spoils the entire
[37:21] program now when human beings were
[37:23] running and continuing to god
[37:25] in continuity with god with one man and
[37:27] one woman this woman sinned
[37:29] and it throwed the whole earthly program
[37:31] out of continuity with god
[37:33] then this interrupts things it's chaotic
[37:35] it's discord
[37:37] therefore one word added to this book
[37:40] or one word taken from it it throws a
[37:43] christian out of continuity with god
[37:45] throws a church out of continuity with
[37:47] god throws a family out of continuity
[37:50] with god every believer can be thrown
[37:53] out by not
[37:54] accepting every word of god
[37:58] that's your that's your um covenant
[38:00] those are your marching orders this is
[38:02] what you're bound to
[38:03] as a believer you must believe every
[38:05] word of god
[38:07] if there is if it is in the word of god
[38:09] then you believe it
[38:10] and you take it as the word if there's a
[38:12] question as to what it means
[38:14] you say lord i believe your word is true
[38:17] i i may not
[38:18] understand that that light that
[38:21] someone's trying to put on i may not
[38:22] understand that context that somebody
[38:24] else is putting on
[38:24] but lord don't let me reject your word
[38:27] on the basis of somebody else's
[38:28] misinterpretation
[38:30] or even on the basis of unfaithful
[38:32] people
[38:33] who carry it lord don't let me attach
[38:37] other things to this word and whether it
[38:39] be stigma or
[38:40] or history or rumor or whatever it may
[38:43] be lord i believe your word is true
[38:47] and let the true interpretation come to
[38:49] me lord let the revelation of your word
[38:51] be dawned upon me because lord i don't
[38:53] want to make the mistake of adding to or
[38:54] taken away
[38:56] because if i do i'm thrown out when i do
[38:59] it throws my family out of continuity
[39:00] with god
[39:01] when i do the church can be taken out of
[39:02] continuity with god
[39:04] so we must the word must have the
[39:06] preeminence
[39:09] so in genesis we see the beginning of
[39:13] all things
[39:15] it's and we can see the beginning of
[39:17] god's purpose
[39:19] right and that's that in itself
[39:22] you can just take that that that thread
[39:25] and identify god's purpose all the way
[39:27] from the beginning
[39:28] how that god desired god's heart purpose
[39:30] in the beginning
[39:31] was to have a bride of his choosing and
[39:34] it's that heart purpose of god that very
[39:36] passion to have a bride that causes
[39:38] this invisible self-existing one to form
[39:40] himself into a body
[39:42] now what what dynamics worked upon this
[39:45] the strong one this mighty one bound by
[39:47] an oath
[39:48] what worked upon him to actually go from
[39:50] being the only thing
[39:52] being invisible to form himself into
[39:54] something visible call a body called a
[39:55] theophany the logo
[39:57] to create from it was his desire for you
[40:00] to have fellowship with you that became
[40:02] the passion the in the energy that
[40:04] formed himself into a logos
[40:07] and then you can see that god then
[40:08] models himself and he creates angels
[40:10] and now he is god the pyramid and he's
[40:12] worshipped by angels but he's not done
[40:14] he creates an order in a hierarchy and
[40:16] then from that he creates the earth
[40:18] and then he begins to model himself in
[40:20] the earth
[40:22] he's now in a supernatural spiritual
[40:24] realm and then he creates adam first as
[40:26] a spirit being
[40:27] and in that he's in the likeness of god
[40:30] but then he wants to follow himself into
[40:32] a body and now
[40:33] in that body adam becomes on earth in
[40:36] flesh what god was in a theophany in
[40:38] heaven
[40:40] and so now adam's on earth and god says
[40:42] oh this is good
[40:43] and then the next thing you know he says
[40:45] it's not good for what
[40:46] for man to be alone and brother branham
[40:49] says it's because god
[40:50] saw in adam himself it's now a mirror
[40:53] and so even before god could have a
[40:55] bride
[40:56] he expresses you by bringing the woman
[40:59] out of adam
[41:00] so in the beginning you could see the
[41:02] purpose of god
[41:03] but not only can you see the purpose of
[41:05] god in the in
[41:06] genesis in the beginning you can also
[41:08] see satan's plan
[41:10] and satan being stripped of the ability
[41:12] to create he can only pervert
[41:14] so he has to work with what god has
[41:16] spoken by his word in the beginning
[41:18] and all he can do is defile it and
[41:20] pervert it and so you can see how satan
[41:23] very quickly when we get to genesis
[41:24] chapter three he's already there
[41:26] we got two chapters boom he's already
[41:27] there perverting it
[41:29] now we might think man what a horrible
[41:31] story why
[41:32] it began so well and we only get to
[41:34] chapter three and already in chapter
[41:36] three we don't even know really what's
[41:37] going on
[41:37] and already satan's got into this thing
[41:39] and messed it all up
[41:41] god put it on the basis that he would do
[41:44] it
[41:45] used the he used the ambition and the
[41:48] false
[41:48] agenda in satan's heart for his own
[41:51] purposes because what do you want to do
[41:52] he wanted to express himself he wanted
[41:55] to unfold himself
[41:57] and so god accomplished creation he
[41:59] spoke and he performed his word
[42:02] and then he made sure he knew one day
[42:04] and he saw that it would be recorded
[42:06] that in the pentagon moses writing these
[42:08] books
[42:08] that god did all things these things and
[42:10] then he would give inspiration for one
[42:12] to write and go back and say
[42:13] in the beginning god created the heavens
[42:16] and the earth
[42:16] he spoke he performed performed it then
[42:19] he preserved
[42:20] the narrative of it for our benefit
[42:24] because he had something that he wanted
[42:25] to express
[42:27] and so in the speaking of it in the
[42:29] performing things happen
[42:32] but yet even in it i i can honestly just
[42:35] say this
[42:35] if it wasn't for the fact that brother
[42:37] branham william brown the prophet of god
[42:40] in fulfilling malachi 4 and and
[42:42] revelations 10 7 you wouldn't be able i
[42:44] wouldn't be able to preach this
[42:46] if somebody said brother aaron you've
[42:47] got no ministry outside of outside of
[42:49] william branham i might say
[42:50] guilty is charged
[42:53] and they say that actually to say well
[42:56] you know there's nothing to your prophet
[42:57] there's nothing to what you believe
[42:58] you'd have nothing without him and i
[43:00] would say
[43:01] you're right you're exactly right you
[43:03] take you take this uh
[43:04] you take this message this word away
[43:06] from take the bible away take this away
[43:08] take it
[43:08] what are we standing on what do we have
[43:10] what do we have to identify ourselves
[43:12] with
[43:12] but you wouldn't be able to identify
[43:14] this without the word being opened up to
[43:17] us and the revelation coming
[43:18] because all you would see is god
[43:20] creating
[43:21] all you'd see is is things coming forth
[43:24] and you could always try to guess well
[43:25] what is he trying to do here
[43:26] what is he trying to accomplish if we
[43:28] went over to someone's home and we saw
[43:30] they're out busy doing yard work and
[43:31] they're
[43:32] putting a fresh coat of paint on in
[43:34] there and they're setting up these
[43:35] things and things ready to say well i
[43:36] wonder i wonder what he's doing it looks
[43:38] like maybe he's going to be hosting
[43:39] something later something's going
[43:40] on and you don't know until someone can
[43:41] tell you oh he's preparing to have
[43:44] a gathering and this person's coming or
[43:46] it's a it's a backyard wedding for his
[43:48] daughter
[43:48] you don't know you could guess all day
[43:50] long at the movement in the activity but
[43:52] until you know the purpose
[43:54] then it all begins to make sense go ah
[43:55] well that explains this and that
[43:57] explains that
[43:58] and so we look back on it and we could
[44:01] even with this
[44:02] if with the revelation that we have now
[44:05] we could begin to see that god was
[44:06] expressing something in all of it
[44:09] adam even on earth all alone there was a
[44:11] mystery to that what was it
[44:13] that this was god when adam when the
[44:15] woman was brought out of
[44:16] man that this is god unfolding that
[44:18] mystery because god
[44:20] even in the beginning when he did all of
[44:21] it he still hides himself
[44:24] he doesn't say in the beginning god
[44:25] wanted to have a bride of his choosing
[44:26] that in a day called the laodicean day
[44:29] there would be a group of people called
[44:30] believers and they would believe in a
[44:31] prophet his name would be william
[44:33] branham and
[44:33] and then it just tells you everything up
[44:35] front and here goes the story of how we
[44:37] got there
[44:39] it doesn't work that way it just starts
[44:41] out in seed form
[44:42] and look at how many people probed and
[44:44] guessed at it but the bible says in
[44:46] isaiah 45 15
[44:47] verily thou art a god that hides thyself
[44:50] oh god of israel the savior this is the
[44:53] very
[44:54] nature of god to hide himself so even
[44:56] though he's unfolding himself and even
[44:57] though he's allowing it
[44:59] to be preserved and to be written by
[45:01] inspiration we believe the breath of god
[45:03] wrote this bible
[45:04] we believe that this bible is the
[45:05] infallible word of god we believe that
[45:07] this bible even though it might to the
[45:09] academics have contradictions
[45:11] and things be out of place and no
[45:12] geographical proof and no scientific
[45:14] proof
[45:14] and things happen in this bible that
[45:16] cannot be scientifically proof and as a
[45:18] matter of fact have been proven to be
[45:19] scientifically impossible
[45:21] we believe it to be the word of god
[45:24] and we and we believe these things be it
[45:27] even with everything that's recorded god
[45:29] is still a god that
[45:30] hides himself so that's the nature of
[45:33] god to hide himself
[45:34] but it's also his nature to reveal
[45:36] himself
[45:38] and god hides himself in simplicity and
[45:40] reveals himself in the same
[45:42] and so yes it's the nature of god to
[45:44] hide himself but it's also his desire
[45:46] to make himself known in the simplicity
[45:48] of it to make himself known
[45:50] in the place that he's hiding if god
[45:52] hides in simplicity
[45:54] don't go looking for great big things to
[45:56] find him he doesn't move from his
[45:58] simplicity his hiding place
[46:00] and then go find end up in something
[46:01] great fantastic to the natural eye
[46:03] he's going to be hid right where he is
[46:06] and that's where he's going to be found
[46:08] romans 11 33 and 34 says oh the depth of
[46:12] the riches both of the wisdom and
[46:14] knowledge of god
[46:15] how unsearchable are his judgments and
[46:18] his ways
[46:19] past finding out for who have known the
[46:22] mind of the lord
[46:23] who have been his counselor this is this
[46:26] is the nature of god his judgments are
[46:30] unsearchable his ways are past finding
[46:32] out says who hath known the mind of the
[46:33] lord who can be his counselor
[46:35] the depth of the riches both of the
[46:37] wisdom and knowledge of god
[46:38] this is paul setting forth that his
[46:40] judgments are unsearchable his ways pass
[46:43] behind you now
[46:44] how is it that you can know his ways how
[46:46] is it you can search his judgments
[46:48] he tells us in corinthians by his spirit
[46:51] for the spirit search of all things yea
[46:53] the deep things of god
[46:54] the things of god are known by the
[46:56] spirit of god and he says yeah he's
[46:57] given us these things
[46:58] he's freely given these us these things
[47:00] it's by the spirit of god that we can
[47:02] understand these very things
[47:05] that's why the scripture says this in
[47:07] ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11
[47:10] he hath made everything beautiful in his
[47:13] time
[47:14] think of that phrase he hath made
[47:15] everything beautiful in his time if
[47:17] something's ugly right now in your life
[47:19] just know that he makes
[47:20] everything all things beautiful in his
[47:23] time
[47:25] could you imagine if if if your wife or
[47:28] your mother or someone
[47:29] you know says i'm i'm gonna i'm i'm
[47:31] making a beautiful cake and
[47:33] and you just went in there and on the on
[47:35] the table was all these
[47:36] ingredients on the counter and you say
[47:38] well beautiful cake my this what is this
[47:40] oh my goodness that's salt that's that's
[47:42] oh what is cocoa oh
[47:44] i can't i'll never forget the first time
[47:46] i think one of my kids was like
[47:47] hershey powder awesome
[47:51] let's just spoon this thing in by the
[47:53] tablespoons and it's like
[47:55] oh that's awful yep coco is bitter
[47:59] you got to add the right things to it to
[48:00] make it what it what it can be
[48:02] and so you could look in on something in
[48:04] an intermediary step and say well that's
[48:07] that's not good and that's not good and
[48:08] that's not good but just give god time
[48:12] he makes all things beautiful in his
[48:13] time he says also he had
[48:16] set the world in their heart so that no
[48:19] man can find
[48:20] out the work that god maketh from the
[48:21] beginning to the end
[48:23] it's a very uh weighty very heavy
[48:27] heavy statement in the amplified it says
[48:30] he has also planted eternity in man's
[48:32] heart and mind a divinely implanted
[48:35] sense of purpose working through the
[48:37] ages
[48:37] which nothing under the sun but only god
[48:39] can satisfy
[48:41] it speaks to the germ of life inside the
[48:43] believer that once quickened by the holy
[48:46] spirit can then begin to understand
[48:48] what god is doing otherwise we're just
[48:50] guessing
[48:51] paul said you know the things of man by
[48:52] the spirit of man that is in you
[48:54] and so then man can have some kind of
[48:56] camaraderie with another man
[48:57] when he hears that you're going through
[48:58] something oh i know what that's like i
[49:00] feel sorry for you oh
[49:01] that happened to you i know what that's
[49:02] like because we know by shared
[49:04] experience in our human emotions
[49:06] what another person's feeling and then
[49:08] by the spirit of god we can relate to
[49:10] the things of god
[49:12] so he it takes eternity it takes the
[49:15] spirit
[49:16] of god in our hearts to know the divine
[49:18] plan of god
[49:19] and to be able to see the strand of
[49:21] god's purpose from the beginning to the
[49:23] end
[49:24] otherwise it's hidden it's hidden from
[49:27] the natural man
[49:28] it's hidden out of their sight to where
[49:29] man can't make the work of god find out
[49:31] the work of god from the beginning to
[49:33] the end
[49:34] that's exactly why when christ came you
[49:36] think with the depth of
[49:37] prophecy that had been given with the
[49:39] signs and wonders that had been done
[49:41] and here he is saying that he's
[49:42] declaring that he is the son of god and
[49:45] and he's believed to be the messiah
[49:47] and now wouldn't it be the moment when
[49:49] everything would click and make sense
[49:51] and they would accept him as their
[49:52] redeemer and to deliver but no in that
[49:54] very moment they crucified him
[49:56] why because it was hid from them they
[49:58] didn't have that divine spark on the
[50:00] inside
[50:01] to be able to see the purpose of god
[50:03] from the beginning say oh he would be
[50:04] lowly he would be humble he would be
[50:06] despised and rejected
[50:09] only from the eternal perspective can we
[50:12] discover what god
[50:13] intended by creation only by the divine
[50:16] revelation of the word of god can we
[50:18] look back
[50:19] and see all these seeds in genesis where
[50:21] god was hiding himself
[50:23] he's hid his meaning in creation he's
[50:26] given in the beginning as we begin to
[50:28] read this he's given us a window into
[50:29] his heart
[50:30] to know his mind and actually when you
[50:32] begin to realize that this window is a
[50:34] glimpse into his mind and brother
[50:35] branham could tell us that now what was
[50:36] in the back part of god's mind is
[50:38] unfolding
[50:39] it's a revelation of everything that
[50:40] he's been doing
[50:43] and then you realize it's not so much a
[50:45] window as much as it is a mirror
[50:48] because you're looking into it and
[50:49] seeing yourself and you can
[50:52] look into the beginning in the beginning
[50:54] and see yourself
[50:57] and though it may be hidden don't be
[50:58] maybe mysterious
[51:00] in matthew chapter 13 verse 11 they ask
[51:03] him in verse 10. why do you speak this
[51:05] way
[51:06] it seems like you're you're telling
[51:08] stories and we're kind of like
[51:12] i don't know and he says why do you
[51:14] speak in parables why do you talk this
[51:16] way
[51:16] he says because it's given unto you to
[51:18] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[51:19] heaven
[51:20] but to them it is not given the mere
[51:23] writing of this bible the mere
[51:24] transcribing and the inspiration the
[51:26] theater new stars the breath of god
[51:28] that wrote the scripture wasn't enough
[51:30] for it to be understood wasn't enough
[51:32] for everyone to know what god was doing
[51:34] the revelation of it is missing the
[51:36] revelation has to come
[51:37] to say oh i see myself in that now it's
[51:39] not so much a window it's even not so
[51:41] much a story
[51:42] but it's actually a mirror where i see
[51:44] god's purpose
[51:45] and how what it means for me and it is
[51:48] it's given unto you
[51:50] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[51:53] heaven
[51:54] there was a quote that was running
[51:55] through my mind time and time again over
[51:57] the last couple weeks as i was preparing
[51:59] this actually i'd say more appropriately
[52:01] just over the last week or so
[52:02] coming to my mind over and over again
[52:04] it's from the token where brother man
[52:05] says the way
[52:06] god starts that's the way god finishes
[52:09] so we see in the beginning god then we
[52:12] know in the end it will be god
[52:14] and the way that god starts by his
[52:15] spoken word and there's all these things
[52:17] my mind begin to think the way god
[52:18] starts that's the way god finishes
[52:21] i was pondering how that in that's in
[52:23] that sense
[52:24] there's ways that we could look at that
[52:26] and it can become very heavy for us the
[52:28] beginning of the thing
[52:29] is is what sets it on its course and
[52:31] we're taught that if something deviates
[52:33] if you take a gun and you put in the
[52:35] sights and
[52:36] brother mike was shared a video of
[52:38] brother mitch in a shooting course
[52:40] and it was uh it was really it's you
[52:43] wanted to kind of get a full scope of
[52:45] what was happening no pun intended
[52:46] as you watch someone they're shooting
[52:48] shooting down range and you realize that
[52:50] if the sight is off just the least
[52:52] little bit in the beginning
[52:54] the longer that bullet travels the more
[52:56] the further off it gets
[52:58] and so it becomes a very heavy weight
[53:00] upon us to realize
[53:01] when we look if there was any in the
[53:03] beginning if it didn't start right then
[53:05] you begin to think well is it a doomed
[53:07] course
[53:08] it didn't start right but the way god
[53:11] starts
[53:12] that's the way god finishes and i i
[53:15] didn't put it in my notes
[53:17] i didn't put the quote there but this
[53:19] morning a pastor from amarillo brother
[53:21] jeremy shriner
[53:22] sent a group text message out and it was
[53:24] that quote
[53:26] and i just text him right away i said
[53:27] brother that means so much to me and
[53:28] it's encouraging because
[53:30] there was some logistical uh problems in
[53:32] trying to get the room for this morning
[53:33] and
[53:34] we didn't know how the service was gonna
[53:35] be and just him sending that just
[53:37] confirmation lord
[53:38] that was a very quote that was in my
[53:39] mind in my heart all week now a brother
[53:42] shares this with me and i said i'm i'm
[53:44] i'm preaching on in the beginning this
[53:46] morning my first service for this church
[53:47] i'm starting in phoenix
[53:49] and i said that scripture is just a
[53:50] confirmation to me that quotes a
[53:52] confirmation to me
[53:53] he says wow you're starting your first
[53:55] we're celebrating
[53:56] today our 48th anniversary of a church
[54:00] the 48th and immediately something my
[54:02] heart just said
[54:03] arizona was the 48th state added to the
[54:05] union
[54:07] and i told him they said you can't make
[54:08] this stuff up
[54:11] so i say i'm not saying it is but could
[54:12] it be
[54:14] i did drive by and i saw a sign i did
[54:17] literally a sign in scottsdale it said
[54:20] aaron for arizona
[54:22] it was just it was something i want to
[54:24] get a picture of it i'm going to ask the
[54:25] guy if he loses can i have those signs
[54:28] all right and i was going to take a
[54:29] picture and send it to somebody and say
[54:31] this is a sign and then no matter what
[54:34] objection they have i said no it is
[54:36] literally
[54:37] a sign
[54:43] but the way god starts that's the way
[54:45] god finishes
[54:47] and so it just almost just almost been
[54:49] an hour here with you in the
[54:51] it's been over an hour from the start
[54:52] but just in the minister of the word i
[54:54] know it's been
[54:54] almost an hour don't mean to uh belabor
[54:57] this
[54:58] but i want to ask this in closing what
[55:00] does god
[55:02] want me to see in the beginning ask
[55:04] yourself that question
[55:06] what does god want me to see in the
[55:08] beginning
[55:09] how is it that i i how is it god wants
[55:13] me to first
[55:14] relate to it and i could be so
[55:18] direct in saying this i know that god
[55:20] has quickened this to me for your
[55:22] benefit
[55:23] to encourage you where you are right now
[55:27] because we ponder our path we say well
[55:29] this where i am today
[55:31] here i am i'm x number of years old i'm
[55:34] in this
[55:34] station in life and and we see the path
[55:37] that we've gone and it's easy to say
[55:39] where i am today what do i have to show
[55:42] for everything that's transpired what
[55:45] what has been accumulated what has been
[55:46] added what has been saved up and
[55:49] and where where am i today to be able to
[55:51] say oh this
[55:52] is all been built up and added to this
[55:54] and this is where i
[55:55] am now and as we begin to look back we
[55:57] see ups and downs and we see false
[55:59] starts we see things
[56:01] that we wanted to do that don't turn out
[56:03] right things that we started all this
[56:04] seems great
[56:05] oh my this is it this is going to be and
[56:07] then it and it fails and it doesn't work
[56:09] out or we have great ambitions and we
[56:11] see that we have failed ambitions and as
[56:13] we begin to look back we realize
[56:14] man there's a lot of ups and downs
[56:16] things haven't quite worked out maybe
[56:18] the way that i thought they'd work out
[56:19] and it's easy to get discouraged
[56:23] and then we begin to look at it this way
[56:24] the way something starts the way that it
[56:26] finishes and we see the seed of things
[56:28] and what the seeds were and the fruit
[56:29] that comes out and we think my
[56:31] what seeds have been sown where's the
[56:34] pattern for me as i began to look in the
[56:36] beginning
[56:36] was the garden of eden in the beginning
[56:38] was perfection in the beginning was all
[56:40] these wonderful things and i said well
[56:41] where what was my beginning
[56:42] how did things look for me and he wonder
[56:46] where's the hope
[56:48] the bible says in the beginning was the
[56:49] word and the word was with god
[56:52] and the word was god so there was the
[56:55] perfect word dwelling
[56:57] imperfection and then this perfect word
[57:00] this perfect god then begins to unfold
[57:02] himself
[57:03] and when we think in the beginning we
[57:05] think of a perfect garden
[57:06] in eden in god's light the garden
[57:11] we see oh this is beautifully
[57:12] pre-figuring a bride
[57:14] my my spouse is like a garden and
[57:17] clothes
[57:17] and we say oh my here's the bride there
[57:20] in pre-figure
[57:21] glorious and splendor and perfect and
[57:23] yet we don't
[57:25] see ourselves that way
[57:28] but look again at genesis chapter 1
[57:30] verses 1 to 5.
[57:32] spare with me just a little bit longer
[57:34] look again and let's look at what we
[57:36] must
[57:36] first relate to in the beginning what is
[57:39] it god wants us to
[57:40] first identify with or maybe if i could
[57:43] put it this way
[57:44] what is it that we could most easily
[57:46] relate to
[57:47] in our brokenness in our disappointments
[57:50] in our discouragements it says in the
[57:53] beginning
[57:54] god created the heaven and the earth
[57:57] and notice this the earth now god just
[58:01] created this mind
[58:02] satan didn't create this this isn't this
[58:05] isn't the children playing with plato
[58:07] this is god god creates the heavens and
[58:10] the earth
[58:10] and then the very first description and
[58:13] the earth was without
[58:14] form that means confusion
[58:18] and void speaks of emptiness god's
[58:22] created it now
[58:23] but in its very first description of it
[58:25] the very first manifestation of it
[58:27] is it's without form and it's void it's
[58:29] confusion
[58:30] and emptiness it says in darkness was
[58:32] upon the face of the deep
[58:34] there was this fluid mass and water
[58:36] mixed it was
[58:37] it was chaotic so it says in the
[58:40] beginning
[58:41] god created the heavens and the earth in
[58:43] our minds we think
[58:46] this beautiful radiant light and and the
[58:49] birds flying
[58:50] and beautiful palm trees and and adam
[58:53] tall dark and handsome and oh my this is
[58:56] beautiful
[58:57] but yet god actually the very first
[58:58] description he gives of his creation
[59:00] without form
[59:04] it's a it's confusion when it says this
[59:05] without form and then says void it's
[59:08] empty
[59:10] you wouldn't look at it and think well i
[59:12] know what to do with this
[59:14] it's and it says darkness is upon the
[59:16] face of the deep it was like the fl
[59:18] there was it was almost as if there was
[59:19] a substance of earth
[59:21] but yet it was a mass it was a fluid
[59:22] mass and it's mixed with water
[59:24] and it doesn't seem like you couldn't
[59:26] swim in this can you walk on it what do
[59:28] you do this
[59:29] and if any one of us today were to look
[59:30] at that we would all we'd probably be
[59:32] repulsed
[59:34] this this confusion is chaotic it's
[59:37] chaos
[59:38] in the beginning but then it says and
[59:41] the spirit of god moved
[59:43] upon the face of the waters and god said
[59:47] let there be light and there was light
[59:52] and god saw the light that it was good
[59:54] and god divided the light from the
[59:56] darkness
[59:57] showing now that he's also showing that
[59:59] he's going to begin to separate fluid
[1:00:01] mess he's going to bring forth
[1:00:02] a and even in the the torah and the
[1:00:05] original hebrew teaching of this
[1:00:06] it begins to describe how that now by
[1:00:09] the agency of god's spoken word things
[1:00:11] begin to be ordered
[1:00:13] let there be light and there was light
[1:00:14] and he saw the light that was good and
[1:00:15] god divided the light from the darkness
[1:00:17] and god called the light day in the
[1:00:19] darkness he called night
[1:00:21] and the eden in the morning were the
[1:00:22] first day god is now bringing order
[1:00:26] the word of god moved on dead and
[1:00:28] chaotic elements think about that
[1:00:31] the word of god moved where there was
[1:00:32] emptiness moved where there was a void
[1:00:34] moved where there was chaos and
[1:00:36] confusion moved where there was a fluid
[1:00:38] mass and water all mixed together and
[1:00:39] then he began to
[1:00:40] speak things and took these chaotic
[1:00:42] elements combine things together
[1:00:44] arrange things and then he actually
[1:00:46] quickens them
[1:00:47] they're all laying there in its mass and
[1:00:51] confusion and disorder but then god by
[1:00:53] the spoken word
[1:00:55] forms them into a condition to be the
[1:00:57] foundation of a new creation
[1:00:59] to bring forth a beautiful eden of
[1:01:00] holiness
[1:01:02] but how did it begin
[1:01:06] and then i would say this to us and to
[1:01:09] you individually
[1:01:10] no matter how chaotic your life may seem
[1:01:13] our first the first way we can relate to
[1:01:16] genesis chapter one
[1:01:18] is not with the beautiful eden but with
[1:01:20] the emptiness
[1:01:21] and the void and the emptiness we feel
[1:01:24] in our hearts the voids that we
[1:01:25] sometimes feel
[1:01:26] like the darkness that seems to pervade
[1:01:28] over our situation
[1:01:29] and then we realize there's only one
[1:01:31] solution it's for the word of god to
[1:01:33] come
[1:01:33] and quick and even chaotic elements and
[1:01:36] even fluids
[1:01:37] that darkness and chaos and all the
[1:01:39] confusion and bring
[1:01:40] order and put things into the right
[1:01:42] foundation to bring forth a new creation
[1:01:44] and an eden of holiness that means to me
[1:01:47] that regardless of how we read it
[1:01:48] earlier we talked about a church getting
[1:01:50] out of cater
[1:01:50] and a family getting out of cater and a
[1:01:52] believer getting out of cater
[1:01:54] it's because they rejected the word then
[1:01:55] it's empty it's void it's chaos
[1:01:57] but then let the spoken word the spirit
[1:01:59] of god move again upon the face of the
[1:02:01] waters
[1:02:02] take the chaotic home life take the
[1:02:03] chaotic personal life take all the
[1:02:05] confusion
[1:02:06] and bring order and produce an eden
[1:02:09] i do not believe it's a coincidence that
[1:02:11] we've gathered in
[1:02:12] a garden inn today why because god wants
[1:02:16] to take chaos and confusion and
[1:02:17] emptiness
[1:02:18] and the spirit of god move upon the deep
[1:02:21] to bring
[1:02:21] bring chaos back into order and that's
[1:02:25] what the word still does today
[1:02:27] with our chaos it's what he can do with
[1:02:29] your darkness it's what he can do with
[1:02:30] your brokenness
[1:02:31] he can move upon it and bring new life
[1:02:34] therefore there's nothing
[1:02:38] that it could be so chaotic and out of
[1:02:39] order that god can't fix
[1:02:41] i say this in hope to our families our
[1:02:43] loved ones our children whatever it may
[1:02:45] be even our hopes for fellowship
[1:02:47] and to have and to have a normal church
[1:02:49] services and have feet washing and
[1:02:51] communion
[1:02:52] all these things we desire to do in
[1:02:53] obedience to the word listen no matter
[1:02:55] how chaotic it may be out there the word
[1:02:57] can still move and the spirit can move
[1:02:58] and bring foundation bring order and
[1:03:01] bring life bring holiness bring
[1:03:02] salvation
[1:03:05] brother braham says in the message note
[1:03:06] that not in the beginning of the
[1:03:08] creation of god
[1:03:09] when he begin to create and
[1:03:13] bring you into existence you see you
[1:03:17] started back there
[1:03:18] as a seed and worked down to where you
[1:03:21] are now
[1:03:22] i want you to hold it into your hearts
[1:03:23] the next time circumstance or situation
[1:03:26] or darkness or chaos or emptiness or
[1:03:28] void or
[1:03:28] great trial or great calamity is
[1:03:30] pressing in on you and you begin to feel
[1:03:32] a little bit of suffocated
[1:03:33] maybe a little bit of anxiety to the
[1:03:35] future might a panic attack
[1:03:36] moving on it's pressing on you then you
[1:03:38] just go ahead and read genesis 1 2 again
[1:03:41] the earth was without form and void
[1:03:43] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:03:45] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[1:03:47] face of the water
[1:03:49] and god said let there be light no
[1:03:51] matter what my void is no matter what my
[1:03:53] emptiness is god you
[1:03:54] move now let the spirit of god move
[1:03:57] again because
[1:03:58] back then in the beginning when you
[1:03:59] begin to create and bring me into
[1:04:01] existence
[1:04:02] i see a likeness of how i feel now
[1:04:06] he says you see you started back there
[1:04:08] is a seed and god worked down to where
[1:04:10] you are now
[1:04:11] and then you were all in christ then
[1:04:14] when christ died he died to redeem
[1:04:16] all of you and you are a part of this
[1:04:20] word
[1:04:21] and how can the bible all of its
[1:04:22] precepts upon precept line upon line
[1:04:24] here a little they're little not one jot
[1:04:26] or one tittle shall
[1:04:27] fail and you're part of that
[1:04:31] heaven and earth shall pass away but
[1:04:33] this word
[1:04:35] this word shall never pass away
[1:04:38] part of this in your hearts is we'll be
[1:04:40] going to prayer here just a moment but i
[1:04:41] want to read one more statement to you
[1:04:46] satan's eden he says then mate then made
[1:04:49] one of
[1:04:49] his attributes from his own body so god
[1:04:52] did he made one of his attributes from
[1:04:54] his own body
[1:04:55] god has attributes in his body like you
[1:04:57] are an attribute of your father you
[1:04:59] notice you were in your grandfather's
[1:05:00] grandfather's grandfathers
[1:05:01] but in that way in that say we'll take
[1:05:04] it down to like you and your father
[1:05:06] you didn't know anything when you were
[1:05:08] in your father the germ of life comes
[1:05:10] from the male the male has the blood
[1:05:11] cell the woman has the egg
[1:05:12] therefore the blood cell has the life in
[1:05:14] it and when you were in your father you
[1:05:16] actually didn't
[1:05:17] you know nothing about it yet science in
[1:05:20] god's word
[1:05:21] proves that you were in your father but
[1:05:23] you know nothing about it
[1:05:25] now the image is as we can say in the
[1:05:27] beginning of creation god began to
[1:05:28] create and bring you into existence
[1:05:30] you were somewhere already you just
[1:05:31] didn't know nothing about it
[1:05:33] he's saying this that god has attributes
[1:05:35] in his body he says like you were an
[1:05:36] attribute of your father
[1:05:38] and you were in your father before you
[1:05:39] ever gained expression here
[1:05:42] and he says but the father longed to
[1:05:44] know you
[1:05:45] and when the union of connection with
[1:05:47] mother then you made you were made to
[1:05:48] know your father you were made known
[1:05:50] to father you are your father's
[1:05:52] attributes you look like them you've got
[1:05:54] parts of your body that looks like your
[1:05:55] father and i'm pointing to my nose
[1:05:57] he said now that's the way god was in
[1:06:00] the beginning
[1:06:02] okay that's the way god was in the
[1:06:03] beginning well we know god wasn't like
[1:06:04] us
[1:06:05] unknown and but yet he's now says
[1:06:08] we were he's wanting us to see that we
[1:06:10] were god was that way in the beginning
[1:06:12] you were in him and he wanted to know
[1:06:14] you there had to be a way to bring you
[1:06:16] forth
[1:06:17] he says every son of god and every
[1:06:19] daughter of god was in god
[1:06:21] at the beginning you don't remember it
[1:06:24] now but you were there he knowed it
[1:06:26] he wanted you to become so he could
[1:06:29] contact you
[1:06:30] speak with you and love you and shake
[1:06:33] your hands
[1:06:34] don't forget that that god's love for
[1:06:37] you is immutable it cannot be changed it
[1:06:40] cannot be interrupted
[1:06:41] he wanted you to become
[1:06:44] so the becoming god the self-existent
[1:06:47] one
[1:06:47] who becomes the becoming god wanted you
[1:06:50] to become also
[1:06:51] so he could contact you speak with you
[1:06:54] and love you
[1:06:55] and shake your hands let's bow our heads
[1:07:00] if you desire prayer in your heart today
[1:07:04] if you have a need in your heart and you
[1:07:05] want to reach out to the lord you just
[1:07:07] want to
[1:07:08] maybe just by just showing that a a
