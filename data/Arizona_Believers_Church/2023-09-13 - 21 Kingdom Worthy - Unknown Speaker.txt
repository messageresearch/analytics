TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so happy to see everyone out to the house the Lord be together in Fellowship the title that I'd like to give the service tonight is kind of just stepping away just for a second from Kingdom identity maybe we'll pick up on some of those themes on Sunday but this is a carryover of character expression and an even Kingdom identity but tonight it's Kingdom Worthy and my desire in expressing this is that we would be and I want this to be very personal to you as you consider these things and really what's something that's turning over in my heart a lot is a greater consecration that we could have individually in our lives and not for one moment would we want to express things to you so that we could just have some sort of church pretense and that you know let's you know let's check our lives so that we're dressing right because you might be on camera or you know people are going to come to church and if they see how you're living that looks bad on Arizona Believers Church though that's that's not the idea at all whatsoever but the the real uh the real thrust is to have real life and the real living and a lot of things I've been studying to find that brother Branham identifies a little bit of problem a problem with consecration or sanctification and he's kind of makes the statement that's why you don't have Victory and I believe that we're all Desiring to overcome we want to see Victory and maybe many different facets in our lives whether it be Financial whether whether it be having a breakthrough emotionally or just finding some stability within our relationships or maybe it might be something very large in terms of a decision to do something and you're just not being able to break through there's a lot of things that we could take a step back and look at in our lives to find that they're actually becoming barriers to the victory to the Breakthrough to getting to hearing that voice that we want to hear and I'm using this phrase Kingdom worthy because I'm going to be doing a lot of reading from the sermon is your life worthy of the gospel and brother Branham takes his text from Luke chapter 14 verses 15 to 24 is where he's drawing these things from and these excuses that were given and I just hope that there's some punch to it that'll really encourage you but at the same time if it doesn't get you thinking soberly about the word of God in your life then then that's uh then you know there's a greater encouragement and hearing God speak to you where you are in knowing that he's mindful of the things that you're facing and I hope that that takes place as well as I'm wanting to look at the manner of our life and how we're living and how we're kind of looking at character expression is kind of how we live our lives expresses the power of the kingdom and not a manufactured environment where we're able to manifest certain things but just to be able to live a daily life with Christ Out Among the people showing Christ power manifesting um the the Life of Christ to others as we're looking at that thought in second Timothy chapter 3 verse 10 Paul says this about himself and it's a quite a remarkable statement and I'm just going to zero in on the manner of life that terminology he uses here but he says Thou Hast known fully known my Doctrine and so we can see this component of the word what he taught that matters what one teaches matters and then he says manner of life then purpose and then he says and so that's kind of what his motive and objective is what he's trying to accomplish and he says faith long-suffering charity patience and these very things that he's expressing there in terms of Faith long-suffering charity and patience he even uses some of these uh very things as the fruit of the spirit in Galatians chapter 5. and he said you've known this you you've seen my long suffering you've seen my faith in my charity you know this and my patience you know what I teach you know the word that I've brought you and he says and my manner of life and that's his conduct and manner of living even the word kind of speaks of a leading and so has something to do with even one's discipline their training they're conducting themselves you know how I live my life and Paul could say this he can say you know me I've lived before you you know what I teach you know my purpose my motive and objective what I'm trying to accomplish you know my faith my long suffering my charity and my patience and so you've seen the fruit of the spirit in my life is what he's expressing and the Bible tells us that these when it comes in Galatians he says there's no law against the fruit of the spirit in other words you cannot preach against the Fruit of the Spirit there's no bar on that there's no law against the fruit of the spirit but brother Bradham does go to Great Lengths uh to get us to understand that the fruit of the spirit or these fruits that we could break them down into can be impersonated and that there can be outward demonstrations of the fruit of the spirit but brother Bradham called the fruit of the spirit he says what is the fruit of the spirit the manifestation of the promised word and so that that kind of takes all these other things that can be a part of it and it zeros it in on what is the real indicator that someone's in the word or in the truth or has the spirit is when their lives line up with the word when the spirit inside of them can say Amen to the word and when they can receive the full word as it's being brought to them and so that's when he comes down and he says unless you accept that word of the hour when it's manifested you're in a predicament no matter how much outward demonstration you have he says how much you speak with tongues how kind and gentle in everything you are if you can't accept the word of God or if you reject any part of the word there you're in a predicament and but he makes this statement about the fruit of the spirit he says the fruit of the spirit proves what you are and I just want to lay these things in very quickly because Paul is saying you've known my Doctrine what I teach you've known my purpose Faith long-suffering charity patience and we could I think we summarize this you've known my conduct my manner of Life How I Live brother bam says the fruit of the spirit proves what you are right and he says not the reaction of the spirit not we know what a difference a reaction and the fruit he says not to speak with tongues not to shout that goes with it too that all goes with it but unless the fruit of the spirit Bears record with God's word and so there's a there's a a spirit inside of you that's bearing record with God's word I just want to lay a few of those things in there at the outset because we have emphasized that quite a bit over the last several Services I think that we have to be in the word it has to be lining up with the word now as he says my life has testified you've known it and he's drawn relation to his testimony brother batam in the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel he's praying at the very outset before he even I think it's even before he takes his text he says Lord Jesus any man physically or woman or child can move back the pages of this Bible but there's no one that can reveal it but you he says I pray Lord of taking this text as it's placed upon my heart to send out across the Nations for the people that they might know what type of life is required of them to live so when Paul says you've known my manner of life he knew the type of life that was required of him to live so much so when he comes to the end of his ministry and end of his life he says I fought a good fight I finished my course and henceforth because I've done what I ought to do there's a crown of righteousness laid up for me because I've fulfilled my purpose and brother Brandon said I'm going to preach this sermon when he talks about his text he's even talking about his title is your life worthy of the Gospel that they might know what type of life is required he says for so many have many as people for so many has asked me is the Christian Life a life of church service is it helping the poor the needy or is it a constant member is it a loyal loyalty to the church in such questions and I would say that there is so much message theater anymore to where we have distilled down the message to loyal loyalty to church being a constant member or just a life of church service and he's posing the question I believe because he's going to demonstrate that you couldn't just confine it to your duty to your local church though that he would say that is part of it he says in such questions father May the correct answer come tonight through these words as we make an endeavorance to bring them to the people he says in the name of the Jesus Christ we ask it amen this is his introduction to the sermon his opening prayer that they might know what kind of life is required because people are saying what is the Christian Life is it loyalty to church is it that I'm constantly attending services and I'm loyal to the the needs of the church and the things that are happening in the church and he says hopefully tonight we'll have an answer for that and Paul is saying you've known my manner of Life Brethren wants to deal with the type of life that's required in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 28 Paul come into the conclusion of the very book of Hebrews and and this introduction to Mount Zion he says wherefore we receive in a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably we have to have Grace for others if we're going to serve God acceptedly we need to have Grace if we're going to serve God acceptably and to serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear he says to serve God acceptably it means a manner which is well pleasing and these are these are I know these are obvious themes and maybe we repeat them quite often but I feel that it's uh the purpose of church is to encourage you and equip you and give you the resources to live to live lives close to God and to order your homes and to overcome and we so we'll draw you back to this principle that your the life you live is where it counts and where it matters I would never want our church to become a hobby or a place of recreation we're just kind of steal away for a little bit and we kind of get our let off some steam and and we kind of shut down a little bit that that's just a recreation that's just a hobby it's no different than the sporting arenas they're going out and playing golf that that's not what church is for and so there's uh we want to know how to serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear that's a matter that is well pleasing he says since we've received a kingdom then let's serve God acceptably let's live the life and the question could be asked what does the Kingdom look like what does it look like in my life if brother bam said here's the Kingdom right here all of it the system and the life if the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in my life I would ask myself what does that look like and perhaps challenge myself through some intervals or some reminders throughout the day whenever there's a certain moment say is this what the Kingdom looks like and it might be enough to kind of nudge you along a little bit out of whatever it is you're thinking about or whatever it is you're doing to say this what this moment matters how I'm thinking how I'm acting what I'm doing it matters this has some substance to it in Luke chapter 14 if you could just look back at verse 15. well and as you're looking there are just verse 15 is where all we need to look at it says as Jesus had just given this uh you know just said spoken of the resurrection of the just and this kind of prompted this Jew sitting there one of the scribes or Pharisees or one sitting there at the table and when one of them that sat at me with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread and the kingdom of God he was moved and and the things that Jesus was talking about would have kind of oriented them to the idea of the Messiah coming and the kingdom of God being at hand and that when the Messiah is present there's going to be a resurrection of those just Israelites had gone before and they'll be able to live in the time of the restoration of the kingdom and all the Gentiles will come to this Kingdom and he'll be ruling and reigning and so there's a lot of Kingdom principles that would have been in the mind of this Jew and as he thinks about this future moment he's like man blessed is he one day who's going to be able to sit there and eat bread in the presence of the Messiah in the kingdom of God kind of an ironic statement because he was ignorant of the opportunity that set before him the Messiah was presently feasting with him the Messiah was there the kingdom of God was at hand but yet there was just something about the language there's something about his expectations and something about his a lack of Revelation to where he's like oh bless God one day one day we'll sit with the Messiah one day we'll be eating bread in the kingdom of God and Jesus is actually addressing his mindset and he kind of telling kind of exposes himself a little bit and the purpose of The Parables and even this one of the great supper it addressed their misconceptions about the kingdom they had certain ideas of what it was going to look like certain things that were going to be required certain things that were going to be made manifest and like oh when the Messiah comes and this is what he'll look like and this is how live and this is what the meetings are going to be like this is what the throne is going to be like and this is oh bless God man we're that day when we eat bread in the kingdom of God and they had a lot of grand ideas about what that would look like so Jesus uses this Parable to kind of punch back at him a little bit says oh you think you got this figured out huh what they assumed would be glorious and Powerful what he's saying is that they would actually neglect it and they would despise it the very thing that they were invited to Feast upon is they would maybe be told you are feasting on failing body word of the son of man ah you know what we want something else I'd be told that now from then on comes the word and the word only now I think we'll take the Plus hey there's something about the nature of man we're saying I know your mind said I know your attitude I know what you'll do in the end you'll be bidden to the greatest Feast there ever was and it won't look the way you think it should look it won't be as powerful as you think it should be and their idea of glory and power would be so great they look right over the top of it and he was telling them you will actually despise and you do despise the kingdom when it's manifested you won't even want to go and you'll make such lousy excuses has anyone ever had an appointment to rearrange their sock drawer that's the excuse I give when I don't have a good one said sorry I can't be there to help you move I have an appointment to rearrange my sock drawer that day and they said I haven't even told you what day it is you're right I'm going to be out of town that day it's bad excuses is what each one of these give and brother Bam's drawing from these very things where Jesus is exposing their attitude towards the kingdom their understanding of what the kingdom will look like even their service in the kingdom and what they would get out of it and how they would benefit and I'm sorry it gives this bidding and each one says it makes the excuse and goes on brother uses that as his text to preach the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel and he says this we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way that's a high standard we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't we take an organizational life you mean we don't have to have dot org in our URL we can just not follow the word of God and be led by the Lord Jesus Christ and we take an organizational life absolutely I remember years ago when after Al Gore invented the internet and certain charges churches were registering their URLs and I remember that one Church took on the mark of the beast because it was dot org and these are things that were being preached over the pulpit things that were being spread but yet you could take the dot org by just not being led by the Lord Jesus Christ he says the life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy now think about this I think there's sometimes maybe just a little bit of a misunderstanding what brother bam is trying to say because what we think is well I've got to live the life of Christ correctly every day in order to Merit the gospel well you've missed it that's not what he's saying a man that's a Christian on Sunday and goes to church set back there and thinks he owns the church because he does this that or the other and on Monday we'll steal and lie think about it he's talking about character that somebody who can come to church and thinks he owns it maybe we could go back to one who has a life of church services helps the poor and the needyers are constant members loyal has loyal loyalty to the church part of me wants to know brother Branham what was it you were seeing could you just tell me give me some names send me a link to their Facebook page I want to know what it is you're talking about because he's dealing with something clearly but a man who thinks he owns the church because he does this that or the other and on Monday we'll still in lie hey cut the rug and do all you want on Sunday in other words do all you want to the church for the church on uh three times a week whatever it has to do with the church he says but what about your Monday morning how do you line things up how do you treat people what do you talk about what do you lift up he says a man that'll Monday will still in line and then he kind of turns it into the web and he says women that'll go on to the public beaches not there won't be a it won't be a it will be a while before Arizona has beachfront property he says they go out to the public beaches and out upon the streets with immoral clothes on I thought of the first lady wouldn't even put on makeup to go before the Pope he says and come back instead of Waterhead haircut spree for the women in the nation and all these dresses when she becomes a mother every woman in the country wants to wear one of them mother type dresses now that's right it's examples now I was trying to remember who the first lady was I'm glad it's a first lady still but they maybe we're not taking our cues from Dr Biden but there's a whole lot of other influencers and people in power where we're getting our cues from and and I came across a phenomenon I can't remember where I was reading it how now that there's how Christians I mean Christianity is trying to compete in the space with the world where now you have Christian Tick-Tock dance teams and stuff like that nonsense nonsense okay all right I heard a door slam and I started to get nervous I was like maybe I drove past the church today and hit the wrong parking lot now he's talking about where we take our cues from what we emulate what we're feeding on and he says examples and they know that those people would do that they take on a spirit of the world we need to be so mindful of how the spirit of the world can just kind of cling on us and how the spirit of the world can still impact the spirit of a man the spirit of a woman the spirit of our children and even though our soul may be sealed we're still susceptible to diseases because of the Flesh and influences because of our spirit and we've got to know how to keep the spirit clean we got to know how to live down by the life of God that's down in our side of our soul or we could take on the spirit of the world he says and that don't belong in the Church of the Living God he says women ought to look to Jesus Christ there's a place that we can look there's a standard an example that we can identify remember I'm talking about if your life doesn't follow Christ it's not worthy we've looked at these scriptures already this year in this series I even believe in second Peter chapter 3 verse 11 we might have referenced it we've been studying it a lot because our inspiration came from the future home and the the the the Earth itself being renovated and the fire that burns up the earth and the pattern that brother man shows for the Earth to the individual and Peter's referring to those of the sin then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ye ought to be ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness in in light of the things that are to be in light of what God is going to do and even the things that are going to be renovated and changed and I think it just it hits me even more when brother bam says that what God does to the Earth he's done to the individual those of us who've had the baptism of fire for God to renovate our souls and set us on fire by the new birth deep down in our soul what man and persons are you to be that there has been uh unbelief dissolved down in our soul what manner of persons ought we to be in all manner of Life conduct and behavior that's what he means by holy conversation and godliness that's Holiness that's devotion this is showing us that it's a life that's got to be lived I hope this challenges all of us tonight and the question is is your life worthy of the Gospel and we could read that and say well do I have I lived my life correctly enough in order to receive it and that misses it um am I have I merited it am I worthy to receive it what's the beautiful part of the Gospel as it comes to those who can't earn it comes to those who can't Merit it the gospel is for those who the only thing they have is the favor of God upon them in the election of God upon them and it was in our helpless State and needing Mercy that God sends us the gospel and so when brother Bob says is your life worthy of the Gospel the sense that it's meant is I'm taking this from the dictionary that brother banham used the most often and even borrowing it from the the definition that you would have found in the dictionary at the time is your life good enough to have been written said done or created when something is worthy of something in this sense is it good enough to have been written said done or created is it worthy of their authorship is it worthy of of their name or their title did they produce this work and did they accomplish this is we just read this book is this worthy of Shakespeare we just read this we just saw this painting is it worthy of a van Gogh and he's saying good enough to have been written said done or created by the gospel is your life worthy of the Gospel is it to cause us to ask ourselves have I earned his favor have I earned his presence have I earned disgrace have I earned the gifts have I earned a manifestation but rather is the life that I'm living are the things written the things said the things done the things created are have they been done by the gospel [Music] do they testify of the Gospel Hallelujah now I'd like to take a very lengthy reading and begin with paragraph 128 to paragraph 153 of the sermon is your life worthy of the Gospel I don't normally maybe just read this much as far as an excerpt from one sermon uh for no not that I have some sort of uh quote meter that sounds whenever I copy paste and I get kicked out because I have too many lines but but rather just just there's times where you can get the point across and hit it with just a portion of what brother I'm saying and I always encourage you all to go back and look at these things yourselves but I think this just tells so much in this In this passage that is super practical and it speaks to the things where the gospel if he's asking is your life worthy of the Gospel does your life speak does your life create does it do is what you do in your life good enough has it is it to have been done by the gospel how well does it your life speak and testify of the Gospel and he says here in paragraph 128 I believe it is is your life worthy of the Gospel a Christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime now if you'll if you could kind of pick the theme that brother banham is dealing with is it a Christian Life Of Life of church service is it a constant member is it a loyal loyalty to the church he's tearing apart a particular paradigm the church-centric attitude sometimes we adopt in order to have a fig Leaf religion to placate ourselves into everything's good everything's cool and sometimes we find that comfort in numbers right well because I'm not the only one that shows up on Wednesday night or I go to a church that's large and we kind of play kid ourselves asleep they all believe the message we're all doing this together and this is a pretty big thing I must be right but listen McDonald's has proven that billions can be wrong so he says a Christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organizational organization moving it's not being a cog in a movement it's not getting caught up in a movement that's not what makes a Christian not some kind of tool that keeps a movement going a Christian that is not a Christian a Christian is to be christ-like and a Christian cannot be a Christian I think this is just so beautiful I love that we just lately it seems to be a real emphasis on this and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man The Life of Christ is in them if you're having difficult to chew in this just check the date it looks post seals when I look at it and he is saying that Christ coming into the man is what makes him a Christian that should be our the primary definition we think of when we think of a real Christian now if you have the Life of Christ inside of you you'll show respect to any person he's talking with my brother on Monday and he was talking about something and he was expressing you know a feeling about something and how that maybe as a Christian you know we should treat somebody differently as a Christian and really what we arrived at is as Christians you treat humans would you treat them respectfully treat everyone with some sort of decorum indecency there's just a way that you treat people and that's the nastiness that's crept into into Christianity and maybe into our message attitudes is we kind of want to have some sort of idea that we see the we see the right kind of markings we see these secret handshake it's like oh I can be nice to you and then we can be mean and lie and cheat and steal with everybody else no God forbid and and he said that with Christianity is a life that's lived and Christianity Christ comes into a man who lives in him so I'll just to close that Loop if someone professes to be a Christian treat them as one fellowship with them as if they are one let them let them get thirsty for that Christ that they claim to know and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the Life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what are those things are these things or is it just cursing fig trees and we ask ourselves what what does it mean something to find out he goes what am I talking about personal relationship to Christ what is it is your life worthy of the Gospel scripture brother Brandon refers to in just another scripture to add to this in Matthew chapter 7 verses 21 to 23 Jesus says wherefore by their fruits you shall know them it's quite a statement not everyone saith unto me now if we could just exercise some spiritual thinking he says you'll know them by their fruits and then he says something about fruits not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven so it's not just the fruit of one's lips where they're just saying Lord Lord but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven I know that sometimes that makes it a little bit more difficult because it might seem to be just a little bit elusive what does the will of God mean for you and for me what does the will of God stand for but yet we know that God's will is his word that one cannot act contrary to the word of God and be in the will of God though you may be trying to do him a service then he says many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord and now he's dealing even with more demonstrative works and our demonstrations and fruits he says have we not prophesied in thy name and you know they had but yet it's not by that fruit you'll know him and in thy name cast out devils and you know what they had but it wasn't by that fruit that you'll know them and I name done many wonderful Works maybe he just didn't want to keep going on and on so he just summarizes it all and he's not saying he didn't but he said that's not by the fruit which you'll know him he says and then I will profess him I never knew you'd depart from me ye that work iniquity so there are fruits that he's saying that by them will know I again I'm not being precise I'm going to be very specific I'd be remiss to try to distill it down and just put a period on it but it is something to ponder and brother Branham refers to this scripture he does it more than once where he's looking at the fruit of one's life is it worthy of the Gospel now continuing on in this his very next paragraph after he says is your life worth of the Gospel well now I'm just going to cut some out here I should have made myself a note then he began he talks about Israel wanting a king how that they had rejected uh they'd rejected God it rejected God's order God's program and Israel wanted uh to be like the rest of the Nations and they wanted to have a king because they had their idea of what a kingdom should look like and we we see in Israel rejecting the prophet they rejected God and that even as we read on Sunday that when he talks about restoring system restore your judges and your counselors and and it wasn't about resurrecting uh some prior king or family and bringing them up to the throne but God's order that he had in the beginning he was to be the king so he's not wanting to look to the flesh he says Pentecost wanted an organization anyhow it got it and that's the parallel to Israel wanting a king that's right wanted to be like the rest of the churches you are go ahead that's just what it takes but God is our King God is our King this is right how we ought to look at this yes sir what is it it's because that the people like they did in the days of Christ like they have in every age they find an excuse this is what we see in Luke chapter 14 and this is what he's hearkening back to what's the reason why people organize what's the reason why people find themselves believing that the Christian Life is a life of service to the church and and and and just because I do this that and the other that I own the church and there's all these things he's kind of punching at when he talks about being a Christian in some sort of great big religious movement and all these things he's identifying some sort of Base Instinct in the human mind that takes comfort in human things and he's saying the reason why this happens is they always find an excuse if I can put this way a justification for what they're doing and he says they have their own Creed they want to eat their own food and they want to wear their own clothes you might not want to say it I bought a cow and I go see whether she'll work or not or give milk or what stock it she is you might not have the that excuse but here's the kind of excuse that they may say I'm a presbyterian we don't believe in that I'm Baptist we don't believe in those stuff such as that well I'm a Lutheran well that don't have anything to do with it that don't mean you're a Christian that means you belong to a bunch of people that's organized and you belong to the Lutheran Lodge the Baptist laws the Pentecostal Lodge there's no such thing as a Pentecostal Church there's no such thing as a Baptist Church it's Baptist Lodge Pentecostal Lodge Presbyterian Lodge any anybody want to say it but there's only one Church and there's only one way you can get into it and that's by birth I love just how clear he is on the what the new birth is it's by birth you're born into the Church of Jesus Christ and a member of his body of the spiritual delegation of Heaven then the signs that Christ is with you lives through you yeah I know it may seem Elementary but brother Brown's hitting at something this is his point of emphasis how things could begin to turn to where maybe he's seeing something after the open of the seals and people expecting some great big something to happen he finds he's got to reoriented them to the the foundation of it all that it's about Christ and this is what has been opened up to us and this is what we're feeding on and this is the one that's making himself known and it's got to be him in you that lives through you and don't get sidetracked by all the accoutrements of church and find that if he's inside of you church will find its place he's inside of you I believe you'll serve the church if he's inside of you you'll give to the church if he's inside of you you'll find the church is for you and it serves a purpose but you can't try to do it the other way around and think that because you're loyal to church that's made your life worthy of the Gospel then the signs that Christ is with you lives through you Christians oh you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a Son of God you must become relation to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son that fellowship with some pastors lately and uh there's just there's some fellowship we have and some meetings that we have and the question was kind of surfacing on Christians and who saved and who's not saved and and I think this would have to be the end of the discussion only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of a church but sons and daughters and there's only one thing that'll produce that that's the new birth think of that the only ones that are saved are Sons and Daughters the only one that'll produce it that's the newest New Birth the new birth is the only thing that will reproduce relationship to God now if you were born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that sets you in a knowledge of relationship to Christ puts the Life of Christ on the inside of you by one Spirit we're baptized into one body that's what he's pointing out here we're not members of a church but we come members of his body as Sons and Daughters of God and now if we have that profession or that experience he says then Christ lives through you if we have that experience brother Brown said I'm wanting you just know what type of life is required and he doesn't want to just kind of give the details of the lives that required without identifying the life that it takes on the inside to produce the life that's required otherwise what he could do is just kind of create a checklist or a bucket list that we all kind of go out there and we try to hit the mark a little bit that's why in the whole uh the the fallacy of the evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking and speaking in tongues it becomes some demonstrative thing that one could do and that just get to whether they after they do it right and once they've done it they're like I got it and everybody's like I think you do I had no idea what you're saying I think that's it all right and that's kind of what he he avoids by wanting you to know by faith that you've met the mark continuing he said here's the question I want to get to you and he talks a little bit uh if you could just go and maybe listen to this sermon I think it'll be a benefit to you he says here's the question I want to get to you the man says what do I do then after we've been born again so many asked that question what should I do then brother Branham if you're born again now notice if you if you could just really pay attention he says what do I do after I'm born again and notice what he doesn't tell you you need he says if you're born again your entire Nature's changed you are dead to the things you once thought well you say brother Brandon when I joined the church I got that well then when God said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he still heals the sick he still shows Visions but brother Brandon my church now you're not born again you can't be now what is he bringing it back to the word test how the fruit of the spirit is the manifestation of the promised word and that if you can't if your spirit can't say Amen to the word that's not the new birth if you're denying the word of God he says you're in a predicament he said that's the one evidence is when you can receive the word not some system but have a clear understanding he says it can be for if the very God if his life is in you when you're born again it's in you like you're in the life of your father and at the very life of God is in you the very spirit that was in Christ in you how can the spirit live in Jesus Christ and write this and then come back down in you and deny that how could the god I when I was uh listen to brother Branham and he kind of corrected himself right and he says that um about the author of the scripture and he says he says Paul wrote it God was the author if I remember I just listened to something where he refers to that and he said it's Paul that wrote it it might have been Paul the instrument of his hand or whatever that wrote it but we know it's God he's the author and he wrote this word and how can the very life of the word the very Breath of God who wrote the word how could he write that word and then be living in you and be like no don't don't believe it it's kind of it's kind of what takes place on the witness stand when someone says do you recognize that handwriting uh yeah I do whose handwriting is that uh it's mine did you write that yeah I did and it says this I killed him it says well did you kill him like no I didn't no no not me he says it'll punctuate every word to be sown did he say well I'm a good church member that don't have one thing to do with it why is he punching at people who go to church and why would I choose a Wednesday night to do that you're welcome that don't have one thing to do with it there's a he's challenging us it terms of does is the life that we're living there's a lot of things that human nature can produce people have very hard disciplines to things and belief systems and structures and personal discipline to ideologies that cause them to give their lives and to commit Jihad and to abuse themselves there's a lot that mankind will do when he's deluded and when he's convinced of something and brother I'm going to say I got to get past this level of human intensity I got to get past on this outward demonstration and I need you to come to a place of peace to know that Christ is down on the inside of you and then if you've got that down on the inside of you says I want you to know the kind of life that that produces and if I could keep bringing that up before you with the right kind of emphasis and Rhythm then I know you're going to make progress down the in this road of Christian Living the very life of God inside of you and he says when this takes place this new birth the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the new birth you will believe and do everything that God says his word is for you to do you will believe and do you will acknowledge and follow your knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God it says and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the Fruit of the Spirit this is this is good it's good to know if anyone has been frustrated with maybe a lack of uh the fruit of the spirit in your life it may be frustrations well enough and doubt is well enough you know just stick with the word of God just stick with the word it's right say an amen do it not stop day and night and believing in the word of God and believing in the word of God I know oftentimes a lot have said is about Warfare and fighting the devil and going toe-to-toe with the devil drawing your sword against the devil and you gotta fight the devil punch them till your arms fall off kick them till your legs fall off and then bite them till your teeth fall out and then gum them to death right and you're like yeah and you just want to find the devil and bite on him first you're like well if I could find him I'd do it but you know the greatest weapon you have against the devil the greatest thing you can do to fight them the greatest way you can declare war on the devil is to believe God's word that's Warfare believe in God's word that's Warfare not how loud you can shout how much all you can pour on yourself not how much you can dance how much you can run not even how much you can testify but to believe down in your heart that God's word is right that's the greatest weapon that's the greatest power that a Believer has it's faith in God's word that's how you fight you just punctuated with an amen you say will I speak with tongues you might do that and you might not will I shout you might do that you might not but there's one sure thing you will do you'll bear the Fruit of the Spirit one sure thing you will do if the spirit's on the inside of you if you stick with it there's one thing you will do you may shout you may speak with tongues but there's one sure thing that you will do bear the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace Faith long-suffering meekness gentleness patient brother Branham says that unless there's fruit I'm just drawn from another place he says and the fruit of the spirit is not outward demonstrations it's an inward work of Grace love joy peace long-suffering goodness Faith meekness genderless patience there you are those are all things that become an abiding condition of the spirit not things that we try to earmark in the flesh but something you know you've got in your spirit and whether somebody recognizes it or not you know you've got love you know you've got joy you know you've got peace you know you've got faith you know you're long suffering you know you have meekness and gentleness and patience that's where it really counts is to know you've got access to it [Music] he said there's just so much reliant on outward emotions and demonstrations because when it takes a genuine pure born-again holy ghost-led life to prove what you are he says you'll bear the Fruit of the Spirit and now here comes the test right your temper will not be ooh and I should have gone and listen to it again just to kind of hear how he says it right what did it look like when your parents got mad with you huh knucklehead right ooh just remember when you got that that poisons the holy spirit away from you when you get to that place you want to fuss with everybody you come along to there's something wrong and we get to a place where a minister will read from the Bible that it's wrong to do a certain thing and you'll just remember here he says you kind of cuts I says just remember there's no Christianity there at all right that's now that by their fruits you shall know them that's what Jesus said now he's talking about temper a lot of things I've been reading lately and where brother branham's talking about where the church had failed and people who sometimes can be the most churchier you know the most religious he says you know watch their tongue tip it like a buzzsaw right gossiping and their personal relationships and can't get along with anybody and a lot of those different things and you realize man there's a lot of religion and pretense that can be out front and that's what the person starts to judge themselves by well how could I be wrong this this and there's a whole lot out front and they're not examining themselves by the word of God he said hey if your temper gets to you you're poisoned the holy spirit away from you fussing with everybody he says always picking fusses or you're always griping about something there's something wrong with you he's talking about don't Lord don't Crown my life at that crabby complaining critical spirit when the word is preached up no you dig in your heels lock up and say no I don't believe that brother bound even talks about it says well you you say this and the Bible says something no I'm a Lutheran I don't believe that the Bible says this no I don't believe that the Bible says that you shall lay hands on the sick and you can and try to find that place where he actually says what he's referring to there I talk about it's he envisions and and these things up no we don't believe in that really he's saying that you got to be careful he said if it's the word and God said so that spirit in you will cope with that word every time because genuine Holy Spirit Will cope with the word because the word is life and spirit there's the kingdom all right let's that's I think that's heavy Jesus said my words are life and if you've got eternal life and he is the word how can the word deny the word what kind of person would you make God that's one thing to know that you're a Christian is when you can fully agree upon every word of God so glad that we have Grace that's one way you know where your Christmas you can fully agree upon every word of God this is a master class the brother bam is teaching us and you find yourself in love with your enemy and it gets real practical as we read through this you find yourself in love with your enemy somebody said well he's nothing but a Holy Roller and you start to get be careful now be honest true story has anyone here ever in your life called somebody a Holy Roller all right so you better think of something else that you've called somebody think of something else you've called somebody and how easy it is to run somebody down about this and run somebody down about that he says oh they're nothing but a holy roll and you start to get be careful be careful but when you really find yourself that you love him regardless of what they do you still love them then you beginning to find and your patience gets from about that long till it just don't have no end I don't know where he was in the measuring of this anybody just keep saying things about you well I don't care what you say get stirred up if you get stirred up you better go pray first before you talk to them again there's some Grace he says don't get stirred up you said too late right you're sorry well then just pray first pray soften your spirit with prayer bring them before the Lord pour out your heart before them you know how it works as soon as you start to do something like that well so and so did this to me and so-and-so did that and they said this about me and Lord could you just Heap coals of fire upon Him may you just cause it to hell just right on their house can a monsoon just come and dump it all right on the walls right behind their house just sweep it all away because he did this and he did that and you know what if that happened it would be really sad and you your spirit starts changing you start realizing well maybe he said that because I said that about him and maybe somebody told me that I said all those things about him he says pray about it first before you talk to him he says don't get in fusses don't like to get in fuss can somebody just make that like a sticker don't like to get in fuss start telling our kids that hey don't like to get in fuss because it happens maybe for some of us maybe if whether we went to law school or we're just natured that way or it's in our DNA you kind of like to our want to build cases and say things I says no don't don't like to fuss get in fuss if you like to see somebody raise up in church and say you know what I'll tell you so and so did so and so it means you like to hear you want the tea right let me know what's up I want to hear it tell me what's going on what what's so and so doing and you'd like to hear it you say now brother shame on you if you say oh is that so listen to that Scandal watch out how many of us should be willing to say I don't want to hear it you did you I don't want to hear it if we were if we were more capable of doing that you'd be in a better position when a brother comes to you in the right Spirit he says I've got a situation I want to talk to you about and they need to say something that's been done they need to express something about the leadership they need to say something about things going on but you're if you're always complaining you're always negative you're always griping about something and then you come along and say did you see who parked there right it's like what does that even matter just trying to stir things up trying to agitate things he says watch out he says the holy spirit is not a cesspool and when he says this this gives me some ownership over my spirit to know that the spirit fell on the inside of my soul that wants to have preeminence in my spirit doesn't need to be dancing around all the rumor mongering all the tea all the gossip and all the 4-1-1 that people want to pour into us I remember one time a sister called my wife and just started railing on people and my wife said you know what well I'm going to commit that to prayer and I'm gonna if the Lord wants me to I'm going to go talk to him she said you're gonna what you're gonna say something about she says well yeah I'm not a garbage can you're going to tell me this I need to I need to bring it before the Lord if God wants me to do something about it I'm going to do something say well then I'm never going to tell you this kind of stuff again and my wife was like thank you you know why sometimes our Spirits are so defiled you've let your spirit become accessible you're letting things get sewn into your spirit a little bit of Gossip a little bit of dirt a little bit thing on that oh you want to know you want to get the latest bits and tidbits and he says the holy spirit is not accessible he says no no no no no no he says the heart is occupied by the Holy Spirit is full of Holiness Purity that's what the holy spirit is this is the way that we want it to operate according to First Corinthians 13 thinketh no evil doeth no evil believeth in all things endureth long-suffering see how practical it is that brother Madam just starts identifying little things in people's lives and instead of him doing a great big huge discourse on how effective our prayers could be when laying hands on the sick or the the right kind of oil to buy in order to properly anoint the sick with it and avoid Doterra by the Young Living in order that you might see the secret he stays way away from all the works of Matthew 7 and he starts talking about the way that we live our life and the kind of relationships we have with other people he says don't fuss when the family gets in a fuss don't fuss with them your mother said I ain't having you go up there that old church anymore well all you think about now you're letting your hair grow out you look like some old grandma don't fuss with her say okay mother it's all right I love you just the same and I'll be praying for you as long as I live he says now don't fuss think about how practical this is temper breeds temper first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from you you'll be fussing back then the Holy Spirit takes its flight temper breeds temper and love breeds love this is instructive to us how easy it is sometimes in our relationships with one another it can happen with siblings it happens between husband and wife it happens with parents to children where there's just a little bit of fuss and that's what you do you get into fuss right and when you get into in in fuss then if you fuss back and you meet that intensity with the same kind of response temper breeds Tipper child gets frustrated and angry and you respond with frustration and anger yourself he says it Grieves the Holy Spirit right away and has given us practical things that we can do in our daily life to kind of have that kind of quick discernment whoa I don't like where this is going a little bit uneasy you know what you can do if brother Branham says that when you get stirred up he says you better go pray first maybe it's okay in certain situations if things begin to escalate just say could I just have a moment let's just step back from this for a second let's just soften our Spirits a little bit we're getting it we're getting away from the very things that we're trying to fix here temper breeds temporary love breeds love be full of love Jesus said this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another that's the fruit of the Holy Spirit love remember the title is your life worthy of the Gospel good enough to have been written said done or created by the gospel are the things I'm saying are they said by the gospel are the things I'm writing are they written by the gospel are the things that I'm creating are they created by the gospel brother Bama says then you've seen those excuse me and did you know you're a little Creator yourself you know that certainly did you know that you're a little creator you've seen people that you just love to be around you just don't know why just that loving type of person have you seen that just as kind there you like to be around them they create that atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk the conversation it's the life we live it's the things we talk about the openness that we have to talk about things that are positive it's the things that we walk away thinking about it's when there's times maybe where we find ourselves really doing good and we're encouraged and we're believing the word of God and you you meet somebody or you come in the presence of somebody and you're just saying hey man how are you doing they're like hey man did you know that by tomorrow morning the US dollar is gone that they're going to declare martial law how many times have you guys got the text message that tomorrow at noon they're going to declare martial law and Trump's going to be president again right and you know what we just let them keep lying and keep lying and keep lying and you let them keep making your holy your your spirit of Cesspool with that kind of nonsense it takes a victory away from you start thinking about other things he says they create that Atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation said this about Christ so there was just something about his talk that caught the heart of the people though he didn't have to be forceful about it in an outward demonstration but there was something down in his talk that fascinated the hearts of the people it wasn't because he was demonstrative it wasn't because he was charismatic I found myself being demonstrative and I caught myself it's the way that he talked it wasn't the way that he was forceful it wasn't his just finding the right kind of volume to the crescendo whereas he taught him the synagogue in those precious words proceeded from his mouth he didn't just find the right Cadence whereas in rhythm with their heartbeat and he knew just how to punctuate it and Mesmerize them with the piano playing and all sorts of music and instruments he just talked in a way that got their attention and it fascinated the hearts of the people by the same token we have the ability by the life we live and the things we talk about in our manner of living the things we promote we have the ability to create an atmosphere he said there's people like that he says then you've seen those every time you shunned them don't get too loud here all time they want to talk about something evil talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there you know we're talking about in the apartment next door he's in here now he's going to talk about this man there's just this Instinct you know they're going to be negative they're going to be critical gonna run something down they're gonna find something bad to say he's here now he's going to talk about this man all they're doing is going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around them or at least you should right it should be something he's like I just don't know where my spirit always feels this way and and there's times you might you might want to start asking yourself take an inventory when you find an attitude creeping out and you find you're getting a little bit short with your husband you find yourself getting critical towards this and critical towards that you actually where have I been what have I been feeding on you take a sister that teaches in school and she's there dealing with third graders all day long and she's going to come home she's probably going to treat her husband like a third grader and she needs to take a step back think a little bit like no I'm at home with my husband different atmosphere different setting and you got to realize those things wear on you they control they control you they manipulate you and you find yourself fighting in your spirit you've become a cesspool and before you know it you're talking a certain way and driving a certain line it's good for us to take a step back and identify the things in our lives that are pushing us to the edge where we're no longer walking in the character of the word and I want to minister of Grace to all of us tonight and say it even with the thus saith the Lord there are Christians there are believers filled with the Holy Ghost who find themselves under pressure and because of the pressure and because of the long tongues and because of the false lifting up and all the things of the world they find themselves no longer acting in a way that's worthy of the Gospel that's so precious down on the inside of their soul you just hate to get around them they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere and the things that you think on and the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere and this is the very statement that I started with this next statement and I hope that this could have uh just kind of bring down to this relevant as I was studying on Kingdom identity and the identity of the kingdom and women the identity of the kingdom and Men and how brother Branham thank God that we had a Prophet come in modern times and speak to us in a language that's preserved so that we could see the word of God address things in our lives whether it's a man or a woman to show what influence is operating in US and he starts it by talking about the influence of a woman who's visible and at the time there may be movie stars and fashion idols and things like that would have their preeminence on TV or on a screen and they would fashion themselves after a woman in as a first lady and I think it's important for us to take a step back and ask ourselves what kind of models are we looking at and how are we modeling our life whether it be in our our demeanor with one another the things we talk about the language we use and there's certain things that maybe we could kind of resurrect from our past and things we might do that may seem to be innocent but you've got to recognize just how much power you have as a Christian to sometimes even begin to marry in that something that's dead and it gives off Vibes and it's alive and somebody else can pick up on it and they can be infected by my where'd that come from you started it and this is I was bringing out some of these statements where Bear Mountain talks about how you watch a man and what he lifts up and what he promotes and you'll find out what kind of life he has he said I went into a man's office here in the city and the man is a trustee or a deacon it is in a fine Church and I went over to see that man about some business and there's a radio over there with that rock and roll or twist or whatever what it was just as hard as it could go so it's what we listen to you think about that it's what we listen to it's gotten watered down enough to where we find ourselves listening to things that you have been able to convince yourself there's nothing wrong with it now maybe so for you but what does your teenage son think when he hears it does he think oh well maybe there's nothing wrong with Bob Dylan maybe there's nothing wrong with Merle Haggard maybe there's nothing wrong with Kenny G or whatever else it might be that you listen to and you've done it because you're able your whole it goes filled you can filter these things out maybe it doesn't get a hook in you so you think but the others around you are watching it listen to it and they don't know they don't know that these things defile and they corrupt and it's building up these bulwarks and these strongholds within the spirit of somebody else and you're creating a stronghold of the enemy in the spirits of others if we just have Grace that it's not happening to you so it's what we listen to and I guess there was 40 Pinups in his office of nude women so it's what we look at now you can't tell me how much Deacon or how much more you let me see what you look at come on let's all think of ourselves tonight get rid of the Pitchfork get the rake out bring it home this is for me no matter how old you are how young you are it's what you look at what you read what kind of music you listen to the crowd you associate with and nowadays when we say the crowd you have got to take into consideration what kind of groups you're a part of socially in a digital world and I don't care if you're using some other name to hide your identity your spirit is attached to that come on the holy spirit is speaking out against things and Discerning things in people's lives and they have no idea where it's coming from but it's hidden itself very subtly behind a name and an avatar what you look at what you read the kind of music you listen to I'll say the reason why you preach this on a Wednesday night is because by the time you're done everyone who was there when you started still there I don't know if I can say that on a Sunday morning they'd be like I didn't even know we had Wednesday night service he says what you look at what you read what kind of music you listen to the crowd you associate and I'll tell you what kind of spirit is in you would we fail a test with all the the history erasing we can do with all the private browsing with all the deleting with all the Incognito with all the ways that we can cover our tracks all the ways that we can find the excuses in Luke 14 how we covered our tracks enough with all of our excuses that somehow we feel as if we would pass the test and brother Brown says let me see what you look at what you read what kind of music you listen to the crowd you associate with I'll tell you what spirit is in you and you talk about a man who's listened to some rock and roller twist and he has all these pin-ups I think you ought to make it a little bit more relative in a digital world what's on your wallpaper what kind of pins do you have on Pinterest what's written on your wall on Facebook what kind of boards are you posting to and reading what kind of forms what are the tweets what are the DMS one of the bookmarks the p1s the playlists the subscriptions the favorites the notifications what are you following what's your avatar what about the receipts hey what about the photos what about the screenshots if anyone feels a spectator in this and you feel that just maybe you're observing this and you're and you're and you're wrestling with this let me say there's a soul crying out tonight saying thank God thank God it's still thank God it can be spoken with such Precision because it's the very thing that loses shackles he says you hear a guy me do so and so that Bunch just remember I don't care what he says because he's again I mean notice how many times brother Benham comes back to the kind of punch at the church identity right decontrusty whatever I don't care he says his actions speak louder than what anything could say he could testify and say he's a Christian sure and maybe do anything but you just watch the kind of life he lives that tells what he is is our life Worthy of the Gospel as our musicians come as we bow our heads brother Branham comes to the end of the service and he says that word is the truth right and the spirit of God will recognize his own writing it speaks to him and you're identified by believing it and it gives your credentials of identification could I say this I'm not trying to add to what brother Branham said but we call ourselves message believers and I believe that this message is the word of God I believe it was sent to us to correct the age and just put it in order and what and this word is the truth and the spirit of God will recognize his own voice and we are identified by what it spoke and we're identified by believing and it gives us our credentials of identification I believe that we ought to take give a more Earnest heed to the things that we've been taught in this message again I will express it to you tonight this way by no means do I feel compelled to say this so that we are so that we could kind of create a little bit better Church image I'll go so far as to say this God had to completely wreck me and tear me down to even get me in this area to start to preach about it because for my Optics I would say I feel like we're doing pretty good and so it has nothing to do with church pretense as a matter of fact you could you could do all these things and and I I I don't have any mechanism to get into your home and call you out and try to get you to toe the line the only place that we might have some Authority as a church is in the positions that are occupied and those that serve there's certain qualifications and things that they would observe and a testimony that they would have before the people outside of that I don't care what how upside down your life is and how unworthy it seems I want to encourage you I want to give you the resources and tools you need to win the battles that you're needing to win is that our lives can be picked up that's the thing that's been coming to my heart over and over and over again perfect Faith all our lives need to be picked up brother Graham said don't fuss with others don't have these family fusses when you've been hurt when you've been wounded when you've been aggrieved sometimes it's cathartic just to kind of argue it out and don't think that the relief you feel after you've fought it out is the Holy Spirit and you coming back around you've already grieved that so he's reminding us this fussing has got to end don't have these family fusses maybe we need to find ways to continue with intense moments of Fellowship and stop with the nastiness and the pettiness and the cattiness and the bitterness and the harshness that surfaces when we have disagreement to hurts he said don't have these family fusses as I said love breeds love and temper breeds temper has the Holy Spirit got your attention tonight if you would not want to give the Holy Spirit the credit of it would you say that I have gotten your attention tonight at the very least I've given you something to wrestle with even if you want to say well that's just brother Aaron and well he's he just said this and he does this and he does that however you try to rationalize with it I would say whatever you do don't make them a mistake of giving the excuses that they gave in the days of Jesus brother bam said you might not say well I bought a piece of land I've married a wife I've I got to do this I've got to do that he says but you'll make your excuses I encourage you tonight not to make any excuses brother Aaron what about the things I wrestle with so deeply what about the things that become a compulsion what about the things that this pattern that I can't seem to break out of do you realize that the great victory that you can have in those things begins in a victory in the small things that if we could come back to an honesty about whether or not you have the Holy Ghost that begins the that the victory Bells begin to ring when we can be honest with ourselves that maybe something's missing because I've never fully surrendered and obeyed the word of God to receive the Holy Ghost and hey that's liberating those of us who even find ourselves filled with the Holy ghostly brother Branham use this language throughout this to talk about the holy spirit being grieved and uh grieving the Holy Spirit right away from you and we can find that in other places in the message maybe you're finding yourself giving into compulsion because other things more subtle have weakened the influence of the holy spirit in your life and begin when we begin to take inventory about how my life isn't Worthy it might find you might find that Victory begins in a much smaller space than you thought it would I'm hoping that you're thinking if you have you could bow your heads for a moment brother Branham is praying at the end of the service and I want to pray this [Music] he says we pray now I I I'll ask this is there an eating heart tonight needy Spirit are there needy homes sister Elizabeth let's raise our hand we have needs in our home we have needs in our life we have needs and relationships we have needs and when we think about everything brother was saying it just seems to be so vast it may be so complicated but listen to what he brings it down to we pray now that you'll bless every person in divine presence everyone that hears this tape Lord around the world may they get away from those old Creeds and things and come and serve the Living God and this is what got me come and invest in it how are we making investments in this church not as a church we invest weekly twice a week we invest for over an hour but how have you invested personally in your home how have you invested in it oh we commit our resources so much to learning disciplines and collecting things and accomplishing things and we have a lot to invest in but oh God how much have I invested in the Living God he says do like the queen of the South did she come took her three months to get to where a man was representing Jesus Christ or the god of Heaven Solomon Jesus says she come from the uttermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here he says and we know the greater that Solomon is here the great Holy Spirit himself is here working through the people he says how we thank you for this father I pray the blessing now and I say to you tonight who have your heads bowed Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is here he's a person he is he is calling to your hearts he is asking for Fellowship he desires preeminence and he has lingered and he has lingered and he has hovered and he has that he has dealt with you softly and he has stayed near you and he now calls you will you invest in me not in church service will you invest in me and he says oh are greater than Solomon is here working through the people and I say God let it be that I could sell all I have that I could come to you and without with my whole heart that perfect love that you require let me present my body as a Living Sacrifice which is my reasonable service that I may serve you acceptably that I can have the testimony that Paul had you know my Doctrine my manner of living my purpose my faith my long suffering my charity my patience oh I pray tonight with your heads bowed I I pray tonight May there be a Deliverance come in our personal lives may there come a Deliverance to our digital addictions May there come and Deliver us to the things we desire the things we pursue May the Holy Spirit Come and begin to perform surgery May the word of God loose us from shackles that abound us and I pray that there would be births and that there'd be Souls liberated and that we would see a mighty move of God Hallelujah let's stand
