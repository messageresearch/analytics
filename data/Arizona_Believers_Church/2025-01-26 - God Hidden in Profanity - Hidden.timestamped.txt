[0:00] 5:
[0:01] 27 and after these things he went forth
[0:04] this is Jesus and saw a Publican named
[0:07] Levi that would be Matthew who is a tax
[0:10] collector Publican is another phrase for
[0:12] those that collected taxes sitting at
[0:14] the receipt of custom and he said unto
[0:16] him follow me and he left all rose up
[0:20] and followed him and Levi made him a
[0:23] great feast in his own house and there
[0:25] was a great company of publicans and of
[0:28] others that sat down with him but their
[0:30] scribes and Pharisees murmured against
[0:33] his disciples saying why do ye eat and
[0:35] drink with publicans and Sinners and
[0:39] Jesus answered said unto them they that
[0:41] are whole need not a physician but they
[0:43] that are sick I came not to call the
[0:45] righteous but Sinners to
[0:48] repentance and when we looked at this
[0:51] passage earlier he said what meaneth the
[0:53] saying I would have mercy and so there's
[0:56] uh We've looked at some of this already
[0:58] in the past so you could take your seat
[1:00] as we've already teed up uh the title at
[1:03] this point and God hidden in profanity
[1:06] and the title slide uh shows a picture
[1:09] of that calling of Matthew we'll come
[1:12] back to it here in a moment but I wanted
[1:14] to share um a uh uh something that
[1:18] Preston shared with me and I thought
[1:20] this would fit really well today um and
[1:22] it's I don't if you recognize this
[1:24] Calvin and Hobbs anybody like Calvin and
[1:27] Hobbs anybody okay I got a few hand okay
[1:30] we I hope that's not my biggest amen of
[1:32] the day but uh it shows Calvin in front
[1:35] of a mirror with his underwear on saying
[1:37] made and God's Own image yes sir right
[1:40] just kind of calling back to how God
[1:42] created a man and then hob saying God
[1:44] must have a goofy sense of humor and it
[1:49] looks at it as I pondered it is here's
[1:52] Calvin looking in the mirror and seing
[1:54] himself for what God Said in other words
[1:57] that God has made Man In His Image so
[1:59] he's saying yes I'm made in God's image
[2:02] but then notice what Hobbs does is he
[2:05] doesn't dispute that fact but he says
[2:08] well then if you're made in God's image
[2:10] and seeing how it's expressed in Calvin
[2:12] he's saying God must have a goofy sense
[2:15] of humor and I know immediately we're
[2:17] thinking the goofy sense of humor is to
[2:20] is to make uh maybe we might think well
[2:22] that's Calvin looks goofy but it's his
[2:24] sense of humor that's goofy which we I
[2:27] think we can all attest to an agree and
[2:29] so Hobbs is make drawing a really good
[2:31] conclusion that if there's something in
[2:33] Calvin's nature and he's in the image of
[2:35] God then that must be God's nature as
[2:38] well you catch that that if you're in
[2:39] the image of God and you're expressing
[2:41] his nature it's not so much just how you
[2:43] look alone but that character and life
[2:46] that's inside of it and so now I know
[2:48] I'll be flooded with everyone's favorite
[2:50] cartoons that relate to and comic strips
[2:52] that relate to this feel free my inbox
[2:55] is open it's not full yet you can just
[2:57] send them my way but I thought that was
[2:59] a really good expression of what's in my
[3:02] heart in talking about art and I believe
[3:04] that comic strips in some ways are
[3:06] considered art there's certainly some
[3:08] artwork involved but as we look at this
[3:11] uh subject of God hidden in
[3:14] profanity that word is going to jump out
[3:16] at us thinking um that it causes us to
[3:18] be bristle a little bit that word hidden
[3:21] um and maybe for others maybe the word
[3:23] profanity causes us to bristle and so I
[3:25] want to start with Ezekiel CH 44: 23 to
[3:29] catch uh my scriptural use of the word
[3:31] profanity or what would be profane we
[3:34] say profanity and we immediately think
[3:36] about maybe dirty words or words that
[3:37] were not allowed to speak and in
[3:39] speaking them these curse words that's
[3:41] considered profanity and yet it is
[3:43] that's how we would describe words but
[3:45] let's go all the way back to what the
[3:47] meaning would be in its beginning in
[3:49] Ezekiel 44:23 and they shall teach my
[3:53] people the difference between the holy
[3:56] and profane and cause them to discern
[4:00] between the unclean and the clean now
[4:03] there's many scriptures that relate to
[4:05] this I was going through the Bible last
[4:08] week and just trying to find every
[4:09] instance where uh profane and profanity
[4:12] and profaning um is mentioned in
[4:14] scripture to get a scriptural full
[4:16] scriptural understanding of what this
[4:18] word would mean and it's the people are
[4:21] to be taught by the priesthood the
[4:23] difference so you must be able to
[4:24] distinguish between those things that
[4:27] are holy and those things that are
[4:29] profane
[4:30] and we can already kind of see what this
[4:32] refers to because it says discern
[4:34] between clean and unclean and here the
[4:37] holy uh would refer to even in the
[4:39] Hebrew uh language and the meaning here
[4:42] separateness or sacredness so there'd be
[4:45] you'd be taught the difference between
[4:47] things that are sacred and things that
[4:49] are not sacred so here we learn things
[4:51] that are sacred or something that is
[4:53] consecrated and set aside if something
[4:55] is holy or sacred it is dedicated is
[4:58] consecrated
[5:00] and the profane means in the atmology
[5:04] even the use of the word it's connected
[5:06] with sand and so if we talk about sand
[5:08] we say well this is just dirt it's
[5:10] common it's everywhere it's under our
[5:11] feet and so if something is profane it's
[5:14] common or before we start leaning too
[5:18] much into this idea that it's perverted
[5:20] but it's Unholy and in being Unholy it
[5:22] means it's not separate or sacred or set
[5:25] aside or
[5:27] dedicated and so therefore the word is
[5:29] used and it's used in scripture in such
[5:31] a way to where something becomes
[5:33] polluted or defiled or sick so it's used
[5:36] in that sense that this has been
[5:37] profaned it's made dirty or the
[5:39] sacredness has been taken away from it
[5:41] or it's sick or defiled but in that
[5:44] wording you have the sacred or the holy
[5:47] and I want to use the word sacred versus
[5:49] or against or opposed to different from
[5:52] the
[5:53] profane it's something the sacred is
[5:56] something that has an intrinsic Holiness
[5:58] it has some quality to it that makes it
[6:01] set apart and dedicated and then those
[6:03] without that intrinsic Holiness like the
[6:06] dirt itself and sand you'd say well
[6:08] there's nothing special about the ground
[6:09] there's nothing special about the dirt
[6:11] and so that would just be common it
[6:13] would be profane but then a temple or uh
[6:17] the something that is Sanctified and set
[6:19] aside for a particular use you'd say
[6:21] that's sacred we've set that apart and
[6:24] this concept runs deep in the Old
[6:26] Testament uh with especially within the
[6:28] law and the children of Israel it's
[6:29] something that's very uh pronounced in
[6:32] their Worship in their ideology their
[6:35] belief and as God laid these things out
[6:37] in the scripture in Leviticus 19:12 and
[6:41] I think this will really help us
[6:42] understand what I mean by profane or
[6:45] profanity says and you shall not swear
[6:47] by my name falsely neither shalt thou
[6:50] profane the name of thy God I am the
[6:53] Lord to profane the name of God and I
[6:57] really just uh Focus as much as you
[6:59] possibly can today as much as is within
[7:01] you but to profane the name of God what
[7:03] is meant here and what the scripture is
[7:06] saying is don't swear by his name
[7:08] falsely and don't profane the name of
[7:11] God in other words use it in a casual
[7:14] manner this is what it's uh suggesting
[7:17] or what it's telling you not to do
[7:19] because both diminish the sacredness and
[7:22] the reverence of the name that if you
[7:24] swear by his name and don't keep it it's
[7:26] like well what value is there in the
[7:28] name if you're going to lie Li in the
[7:30] name of God if you're going to lie
[7:31] swearing by God then it's not sacred
[7:34] there's no consequence it's not
[7:35] something to be revered and then if you
[7:38] just Pro you profane it by just using it
[7:41] in a casual manner you're making it
[7:43] common or is the Bible is saying profane
[7:47] so profanity in the context of the Old
[7:49] Testament involves treating something
[7:52] that is sacred as
[7:54] ordinary that if something is sacred or
[7:56] special or set apart or has some uh
[7:59] particular designation and use but then
[8:01] you defile it or you pollute it or you
[8:03] make it sick or weaken it uh you can do
[8:05] so just by treating it as ordinary or
[8:08] ignoring its intrinsic separateness or
[8:11] its uniqueness or its
[8:12] specialness Ezekiel chap 22: 26 it says
[8:16] her priests have violated my law so this
[8:19] kind of circles back uh to where we were
[8:21] in Ezekiel and have profaned mine holy
[8:25] things how have they profaned holy
[8:27] things they put no difference between
[8:29] the holy and profane neither have they
[8:31] showed difference between the clean and
[8:33] the unclean lot of layers there there's
[8:35] a lot that we could draw on what's clean
[8:38] what's not clean avoid this and and and
[8:39] you can do this he says and have hid
[8:42] their eyes from my sabbaths and I am
[8:45] profaned among them now a day there's
[8:48] nothing special about a day necessarily
[8:51] sometimes we say what what's your uh
[8:54] favorite day well everyone that ends in
[8:56] why and so you kind they're all there
[8:58] they're just days right right but God
[9:00] set aside the Sabbath and he said set it
[9:02] aside and keep it make it holy so
[9:06] although the sun's going to rise on that
[9:09] day and set on that day just like it is
[9:11] any other day this is a day where you
[9:13] ought to regard it as sacred and not do
[9:17] certain things and do other things and
[9:19] moderate your behavior based upon the
[9:21] fact that I want you to regard this
[9:24] 24-hour period from the Sundown uh uh
[9:28] and to regarded as they would look at a
[9:30] day to regard it in a very special way
[9:33] amen and as they have profaned the
[9:36] Sabbath it's by hiding their eyes for my
[9:39] Sabbath how have they done that they've
[9:41] treated the Sabbath just like any other
[9:44] day doesn't me on the Sabbath is when
[9:46] they they got drunk or they smoked weed
[9:48] or or they popped some pills or they
[9:50] they cursed their neighbor it's not it
[9:52] didn't require some sort of overt uh
[9:56] hostile act against sanctity but just
[9:58] treat it like like any other
[10:01] day they have profaned holy things
[10:04] things that are sacred and they don't
[10:07] regard there's no difference between the
[10:08] holy and the profane and the example is
[10:10] they hid their eyes from the Sabbath
[10:12] that I told them to keep
[10:14] sacred Holiness in the
[10:16] Hebrew kadosa is setting things apart or
[10:21] elevating them distinguishing them in
[10:24] contrast with the everyday or the common
[10:27] The Cho where you that the Cho is the
[10:29] the root for profane and profan in these
[10:31] different places there's several
[10:33] different conjugations of that so the
[10:34] holy are set apart and they're
[10:37] contrasted by just the everyday or
[10:39] common in the New Testament even the
[10:42] profane the babos is that which is
[10:46] accessible in the New Testament when the
[10:48] word profane is used it comes from a
[10:50] word that means uh lawful or legal to
[10:53] walk upon to trot upon so when we think
[10:56] of something that is uh maybe this is a
[10:58] way of thinking about it that uh when
[11:00] you see a no trespassing sign that is
[11:03] set aside and designated for particular
[11:06] use to those who privately own it for
[11:08] their own use but then when you see
[11:10] something that's public it's legal to
[11:12] walk upon it or to access it so the
[11:14] difference between holy and profane even
[11:17] in the New Testament is something that
[11:19] is accessible something that is legal to
[11:21] walk upon so it would be unhallowed or
[11:24] common a public place is what's meant by
[11:27] the word now when you begin to think
[11:30] about things that can be defiled and and
[11:32] how profane becomes a dirty word is when
[11:35] you take something that is sacred and
[11:37] you make it common you strip it of its
[11:40] Holiness so when a profane is used in
[11:42] the New Testament can speak of something
[11:43] unclean or un Unholy or defiled and
[11:47] those are words that it's translated to
[11:48] and all refer to things that are common
[11:51] ordinary or part of everyday life even
[11:54] in the Latin profus means outside of the
[11:57] temple if it's profane it's outside of
[12:00] the temple that that sacred Place
[12:02] something set aside for specific use
[12:04] something that is to represent Holiness
[12:08] and Purity profan is something outside
[12:11] of the sanctuary or just something
[12:13] that's not part of religious
[12:15] practice things that we do that we do is
[12:18] a part of honoring the Lord and serving
[12:20] God and uh
[12:23] uh a prayer a dedication things that we
[12:26] would say these things are holy these
[12:27] things are right these things are pure
[12:29] but then there's other things we do that
[12:30] are not a part of our religious practice
[12:32] they're just profane and
[12:35] common so think of it in this way when
[12:38] we say God hidden in profanity we're
[12:41] looking at the sacred God the Divine or
[12:44] deity Christ many different ways the
[12:46] word we could use that uh there's a lot
[12:49] of connections to the temple and those
[12:50] things we ministered on last year the
[12:52] house of the Lord a lot of that's going
[12:54] to make uh just be highlighted again
[12:56] today the sacred and the profane is
[12:58] those things which are spiritual or what
[13:00] we would believe to be religious Are
[13:02] Holy and those things that are ordinary
[13:05] common maybe even secular things that
[13:07] just just just human
[13:09] life now I want to use this as an
[13:13] example and I may be putting some people
[13:15] to sleep already and if I've already put
[13:18] you to sleep with that you might start
[13:20] snoring
[13:21] now I want to look at this from this
[13:24] perspective and I wouldn't share this if
[13:26] I didn't think it would help us but
[13:28] there are things within the within art
[13:31] and historically and just through
[13:33] generations there's this concept and
[13:35] this idea of sacred art and the purpose
[13:39] behind sacred art is it it's wanting to
[13:42] connect the one who's viewing the art
[13:43] The Observer with the Divine that it
[13:47] would be painted in such a way to where
[13:48] we're representing something that is
[13:50] sacred something that is Holy something
[13:52] that is divine and present it in a way
[13:55] that causes you to reverence it causes
[13:58] you to the representation not the
[14:00] painting itself but what is rep it
[14:02] represents and to think about it and to
[14:04] ponder it its greatness and to invoke
[14:06] this awe like the Grandeur of it it's so
[14:10] Grand and very in particular they wanted
[14:14] to Sacred artist to present an image
[14:16] that transcends just the monotony the
[14:18] mundane of everyday life wants to it it
[14:22] seeks to convey these deeper meanings
[14:24] and spiritual
[14:25] truths and I wanted to use some examples
[14:28] of this
[14:29] and this is a this particular example uh
[14:33] is a painting of Jesus Christ now we
[14:36] would look at it and we would recognize
[14:38] immediately maybe this is just symbolic
[14:40] and this is what sacred art was supposed
[14:43] to do it's not necessarily try to be uh
[14:46] real or very particular about how he
[14:48] actually looked but Ed symbolism and
[14:50] imagery to convey something holy or
[14:53] sacred and so you have the use of the
[14:56] Halo you have this golden book and I
[14:59] don't know what what this is but you
[15:00] find this in almost every single
[15:02] painting of Christ that blessing gesture
[15:05] and uh and this is to present to you a
[15:09] Christ figure that this is what he would
[15:11] look at and so you think oh the Halo the
[15:13] gold and obviously this particular
[15:14] painting has degraded through time but
[15:16] if you could imagine in its original
[15:18] richness how it would look and so sacred
[15:21] art would have different symbols or or
[15:24] uh elements to it of halos very
[15:27] pronounced extravagant Halos they're be
[15:29] gold backgrounds as you can seeart here
[15:31] there'd be certain symbolic colors and
[15:33] there'd be even this unnatural style a
[15:35] lot of times where it would uh and even
[15:38] unnatural proportions where the sacred
[15:40] are much larger and greater in
[15:42] proportion to other things uh this is
[15:45] another mural it's been degraded quite a
[15:47] bit but this is an example of that
[15:49] sacred art where Jesus here has this
[15:52] golden Halo and the background is gold
[15:54] it's to convey to you right off the bat
[15:56] when you look at it this just isn't some
[15:58] commoner
[15:59] this is somebody
[16:03] special and then you have profane
[16:08] art sacred art which is done in such a
[16:11] way to where it's not actually natural
[16:13] even in its representation but it wants
[16:15] to convey something Grand and greater
[16:19] than natural things and then here this
[16:22] would be a good example profane art
[16:24] anybody recognize the painting Potato
[16:27] Eaters by Van go it's one of his uh uh
[16:32] more famous paintings and what he was
[16:35] painting here is just common everyday
[16:36] Dutch
[16:37] people and there's nothing uh looking at
[16:41] this uh in some ways it's unsettling
[16:45] it's very dark there's not a lot of use
[16:47] of light but yet there's a great deal of
[16:49] light that follows falls on everything
[16:51] but it profane art is not art that is
[16:54] perverted or grotesque but just explores
[16:58] things of everyday
[17:00] life where it it looks at ordinary Human
[17:04] Experience just ordinary situations
[17:07] here's somebody here's a family sitting
[17:09] around in the evening eating
[17:12] potatoes and uh having dinner and
[17:15] drinking their tea this is this is just
[17:17] a common scene in everyday
[17:19] life as it would relate to even
[17:21] religious things here's a Rembrant
[17:24] painting of the taking down of Christ
[17:27] off of the Cross and doing this he uses
[17:30] light to convey the uh to give us some
[17:33] sense of what's happening and I can't
[17:36] remember here just exactly where he may
[17:38] have painted his face into this uh his
[17:40] self-portrait but this would be a
[17:42] rendering of something that we would say
[17:43] is scriptural uh uh and this isn't maybe
[17:46] a glorious scene this is the dead body
[17:48] of Jesus Christ being taken off the
[17:51] cross and it's presented kind of in a in
[17:53] a a natural way nothing added to it to
[17:57] make it seem more more glorious or more
[17:59] extravagant and there's not uh there's
[18:02] not these cherubs floating around
[18:04] there's not gold inlaid here and there's
[18:06] not these different proportions there's
[18:07] not a gigantic Halo behind his head his
[18:10] fingers aren't being held in a
[18:11] particular way this is just
[18:13] conveying the normal the ordinary of one
[18:17] dying and being taken off the
[18:23] cross I'm going to come back to
[18:25] that in Genesis 18: 27 just looking at
[18:29] this mundane profane Abraham answered
[18:33] and said behold now this is Genesis 18
[18:35] is a uh so much uh deep things in this
[18:40] he's wanting to talk to God
[18:42] about uh this Angel God visiting him in
[18:45] the form of an man he wants to talk to
[18:47] him about those in Sodom and and don't
[18:49] destroy them and he says behold now I've
[18:52] taken upon me to speak unto the Lord
[18:54] which am but dust in
[18:57] ashes in other words I'm using my own
[19:00] words he's
[19:01] profane all he is he's saying is I'm
[19:04] entirely human there's nothing different
[19:07] about me that would set me apart from
[19:09] those in Sodom there's nothing different
[19:11] than me that would set me apart from lot
[19:13] there I am but dust and Ashes just like
[19:16] everyone else that's what is meant by
[19:20] the profane it's sand it's dust it's
[19:22] ashes in itself it doesn't seem to be
[19:25] anything special or sacred about it now
[19:28] especially during the time of Van go
[19:30] he's considered the father of modern art
[19:32] uh in in the 1800s but even backing up
[19:35] more there was a lot in the the Dutch
[19:37] Reformed Church they particularly uh
[19:40] pronounce these different things but the
[19:42] Reformation begin to bring a Great
[19:45] Divide in in the art in arts how Christ
[19:48] and Christianity was represented and how
[19:51] you would portray it in art and Luther
[19:54] and Calvin and you'll find in the
[19:55] history they banished paintings from
[19:57] churches they ban sculptures from
[19:59] churches and some as the Dutch reformed
[20:02] they been banned all paintings of Christ
[20:05] Mary God anything you were not to
[20:07] represent them in any way in any form uh
[20:11] in
[20:12] art and so the Catholic response was
[20:15] this and I read this from a historian
[20:17] that whenever Luther and Calvin and the
[20:19] Reformation begin to uh ban these
[20:22] paintings from churches and these
[20:24] sculptures and kind of change their
[20:26] focus away away from those things that
[20:28] kind cic Church said why don't we lean
[20:30] into it and they responded with a great
[20:35] outpouring of imagery ornament colors
[20:39] contrast and Theatrical Decor fit to
[20:43] Dazzle the believer and reaffirm the
[20:47] predominance of Rome wow I want you to
[20:51] I'm wanting to put it in this sense that
[20:53] this sacred art that was used to convey
[20:57] things that were unnatural and holy and
[20:59] the use of halos and gold and colors and
[21:02] proportions it was all meant to be
[21:05] sacred art this is sacred and art should
[21:08] be used to convey certain spiritual
[21:10] themes and it should cause people to set
[21:12] in awe and wonder and so their response
[21:16] was when the Dutch or when the
[21:18] Reformation comes instead of pulling
[21:21] back from those things in their churches
[21:23] and in their imagery they make it even
[21:25] more
[21:26] extravagant and so then sacred Dart
[21:28] comes to look like this and I don't know
[21:30] if you could see this very well but this
[21:32] is the uh this is the ceiling not the
[21:35] cistin chapel but this is a ceiling of a
[21:37] cathedral and this is the triumphal
[21:40] entry of Christ or the uh the Triumph in
[21:43] the Name of Christ and this is
[21:47] dramatic this the style that's used here
[21:49] is to convey some sense of what is
[21:51] happening all these different things
[21:53] there's this sacred style there's this
[21:55] Grandeur H H there's a great intensity
[21:58] when you look at this and it presents it
[22:01] in in a way where it is totally
[22:03] unnatural the proportions are
[22:04] unreasonable because you begin to look
[22:06] at it you're like how do I Orient myself
[22:09] with all these forms and their shapes
[22:12] and everywhere they where how they are
[22:14] laid out and this is in a
[22:16] church and look at this church here's
[22:19] the Triumph in the Name of Christ look
[22:21] at the gold look at the ornate uh uh uh
[22:25] handiwork it was all meant to convey a
[22:28] sense of awe power Grandeur to walk into
[22:33] place and say based upon what strikes my
[22:35] senses God must be in this
[22:40] place to roam the sacred were those
[22:43] things that were set apart for a holy
[22:46] purpose those things which are connected
[22:48] with the Divine so in their ideology say
[22:51] there's things that are sacred the
[22:52] church the altar the god Christ and so
[22:55] the profane to them well that just focus
[22:58] on focuses on as I use the word mundane
[23:02] matters these things that pertain just
[23:04] to the individual and it was those
[23:06] things which could be known solely by
[23:10] human
[23:11] sense when you look at that picture of
[23:13] the Triumph in the Name of Christ
[23:15] there's there's something Beyond
[23:17] yourself trying to figure out what's
[23:18] happening what would that feel like what
[23:20] would that look like what is being
[23:22] presented and so that's that's the
[23:24] sacred
[23:25] art but the profane you know the Prof a
[23:28] because we are profane the Bible says
[23:31] for what man knoweth the things of man
[23:33] save the spirit of man which is in him
[23:36] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[23:38] but the spirit of God so 1 Corinthians
[23:41] 2:11 to me provides an opportunity to
[23:43] look at it scripturally and say the
[23:45] sacred is known by that sacred Spirit
[23:47] the Divine is known by a Divine Spirit
[23:50] the things of God are known because the
[23:52] spirit of God is made available or you
[23:55] have the spirit of God it's by the
[23:57] spirit of God that you can contact no
[24:00] apprehend and grasp spiritual
[24:02] Supernatural things if I could put it in
[24:05] these words to serve my purpose today in
[24:08] other words the profane was knowable
[24:10] through human
[24:12] experience we may not be Dutch we may
[24:15] not be potato Farmers we may have never
[24:17] sat down and had a meal of potatoes
[24:19] unless they were cut into Strings and
[24:20] deep fried but there's but yet we can
[24:23] look at a scene where people are sitting
[24:25] around a table eating and we can begin
[24:27] to know that's knowable that's something
[24:30] that we can grasp but the sacred is
[24:33] everything beyond what we can experience
[24:36] with our senses the sacred was to be
[24:39] things that strike us with awe and
[24:41] wonder one historian put it this way
[24:43] sacred images were were to convey
[24:47] theological subjects in a clear and
[24:49] unequivocal fashion and win over the
[24:52] viewer by appealing to the
[24:56] emotions now we're emotional creatures
[24:59] and that's the purpose of art really in
[25:01] any any setting whether it be a book
[25:03] whether it be TV whether movies you name
[25:05] it it wants to get some hook he wants to
[25:08] conjure up some sort of emotion and move
[25:11] the viewer The Listener the one that is
[25:13] taking it in and now Rome and sacred art
[25:17] maybe not just Rome but I want you to
[25:18] think more Catholicism and the church
[25:21] and denominationalism and those things
[25:23] and this false religion and how that
[25:26] they want sacred art and even to some
[25:28] art was to be used only for sacred
[25:31] purposes remember even the argument that
[25:34] the decay of of The Art of Lying is what
[25:37] allowed things to diminish and that art
[25:39] should lie as a way of entertaining us
[25:43] well the church is essentially doing the
[25:45] same thing but yet they are given
[25:47] artistic license to say we want the
[25:50] things that we cannot know we're we we
[25:53] we have to borrow language we have to
[25:55] borrow human thought and and these
[25:57] things so we want to use things that are
[25:58] Grand and Beyond the knowable to convey
[26:01] this sense of
[26:03] awe cause your emotions to be moved and
[26:07] in doing so it wins you over to believe
[26:09] this is God this is
[26:11] Holy and we may not be able to get to it
[26:14] today but Rome in this way was forcing a
[26:17] certain uh homogeneity where everything
[26:20] was homogeneous everything was the same
[26:22] and they would the art was to convey a
[26:24] certain Serenity and there was to use
[26:26] these soft edges these perfect
[26:29] features because it was wanting to move
[26:32] us by our
[26:35] emotions this is where art was for quite
[26:38] a some time enter Michelangelo macii de
[26:44] Caravaggio and
[26:48] he began to approach scriptural things
[26:53] and art in a way that was not commonly
[26:56] accepted that was we'll get into it a
[26:58] little bit it was a turnoff to religion
[27:01] and religious people here is a picture
[27:04] of David triumphing over
[27:08] Goliath David having cut off the head of
[27:10] Goliath he's a triumphant Victor but
[27:12] look at the look on his face some sense
[27:15] maybe a dissatisfaction and maybe a
[27:18] greater longing he's not triumphing he's
[27:20] not smiling he's he's not conquering
[27:21] he's not Victorious and this is kind of
[27:24] grotesque
[27:26] right uh there's no FID Angel for this
[27:28] slide I apologize but yet here is David
[27:33] triumphant with the head of Goliath in
[27:35] his hands and Caravaggio has painted
[27:38] himself as the head of Goliath he used
[27:41] his own self-portrait in this and this
[27:44] is something that when you look at it
[27:46] you're not think you're not inspired by
[27:49] Soft features and gold and Halos and
[27:52] you're not immediately moved if you
[27:54] weren't familiar with the story you'd be
[27:55] like what kind of repulsive art is this
[27:59] what kind of grotesque representation is
[28:01] this but he was conveying a scriptural
[28:04] story in a way that we could now begin
[28:06] to see and feel and understand what
[28:09] happened when David cut off the head of
[28:11] Goliath Beyond necessarily just reading
[28:14] it causes that scene to come to life a
[28:18] biographer of cavio wrote about cavio he
[28:21] was a
[28:23] thunderstroke there is Art before kagio
[28:26] and art after Caravaggio and they aren't
[28:29] the same thing the whole of Rembrandt's
[28:32] career is a response to the thunder
[28:34] strike of seeing caravaggio's
[28:36] art the argument is and some have put
[28:39] forth that vermier and de la Croy and
[28:41] Corb and and man they never
[28:44] exist without cajio and this is a pretty
[28:48] intense art
[28:50] lecture cavio broke down
[28:54] barriers between the sacred and the
[28:56] profane
[28:59] there was this movement in art and there
[29:01] was this uh maybe this maybe could be
[29:04] some Renaissance where you wanted to
[29:06] romanticize certain things and things
[29:08] were to be viewed in this fantasy and uh
[29:11] you wanted something Beyond yourself to
[29:13] be entertained by and he began to break
[29:15] that wall down where religious art was
[29:16] for this one purpose of conveying the
[29:19] sacred to strike the the the viewer to
[29:22] these these Grand emotions but now he's
[29:25] beginning to draw the paint these scenes
[29:28] where the sacred is confronting the
[29:31] profane and he's drawn to paint things
[29:33] in a way that wouldn't be hanging in a
[29:35] cathedral wasn't these soft edges and
[29:37] perfect features and his Works begin to
[29:40] push the boundaries of religious
[29:42] propriety and the response of the art
[29:44] community and the church and those H uh
[29:47] viewing the art considered it crew they
[29:49] considered it
[29:51] disrespectful because he depicted
[29:53] biblical figures in just ordinary form
[29:58] he stripped them of what would be the
[30:00] sacred imagery this devotional image
[30:04] where just by looking at the picture you
[30:06] immediately know oh this is uh this is
[30:10] Christ or this is something special this
[30:12] is Grand this is
[30:13] Holy and let me say this before I begin
[30:16] to show these slides so that you
[30:18] understand where I'm coming from from
[30:20] this there's an image of Christ that the
[30:25] church that sacred art was con vein that
[30:29] was so far beyond yourself you just were
[30:31] in
[30:33] awe the Halos the gold the imagery the
[30:37] chapel the the frescos those things were
[30:39] just so all inspiring that you saw it
[30:43] completely independent you couldn't rely
[30:45] anymore on your senses and Human
[30:47] Experience so it causes this Euphoria it
[30:50] caused some sense Beyond yourself and I
[30:53] know we've seen so much media and
[30:55] entertainment andmore it's really hard
[30:56] for us to imagine a feeling causing us
[30:58] to be like but just imagine you never
[31:01] seen a movie before just imagine just
[31:03] mundane everyday life and all the color
[31:05] you ever saw was in nature and then one
[31:07] day you look at a painting that man has
[31:09] C drawn and you're you're struck with
[31:11] this arm I don't know maybe just think
[31:14] about the new phone when you saw the new
[31:16] graphics and try to figure out well this
[31:18] is kind of where we're coming from the
[31:21] latest release of clash Royale right you
[31:23] remember how like oh my goodness look at
[31:24] the graphics
[31:26] now and so there's a certain way that
[31:29] that would have conveyed such this
[31:31] Grandeur but now there's this
[31:33] reformation and I think there's a
[31:35] spiritual application here that I want
[31:36] you to catch there's this rap uh uh
[31:39] Reformation in this Cav AIO who himself
[31:41] was such a contradiction but by joining
[31:44] the sacred things of Christ the
[31:48] scripture and presenting it in a profane
[31:51] way Christ was becoming
[31:55] relatable Christ was becoming knowable
[32:00] in this painting the Madonna of Loretto
[32:03] this was highly criticized when cavio uh
[32:06] drew it why because here's Mary the
[32:08] mother of Jesus and she's Barefoot she's
[32:12] not dressed in these opulent clothes and
[32:15] this was this was Pearl clutching in
[32:17] that day how could you paint the Madonna
[32:20] how could you paint the mother Mary how
[32:21] could you paint the Virgin H in such a
[32:24] common ordinary way and in this scene
[32:27] you see uh uh the these ones bowing are
[32:30] dressed in a way that would be accurate
[32:32] for the 16th 16th century Christ is
[32:35] presented just as a a baby kind of large
[32:38] I don't know how old he was there but uh
[32:42] maybe there was some unnatural
[32:43] proportions here but and there's just
[32:45] slight
[32:46] Halos very slight that if you didn't
[32:49] maybe if you weren't looking closely you
[32:51] wouldn't have even noticed one here and
[32:53] upon Mary so there is something done to
[32:55] convey they're holy there's there's
[32:57] enough there to get the sense that this
[32:59] is symbolic but this is an ordinary
[33:03] scene what he's representing here and
[33:05] portraying here is Christ and and and
[33:08] the mother his mother Mary and it's not
[33:11] in this opulent Grand form it's common
[33:13] it's
[33:14] profane in The Taking of Christ here's
[33:17] Christ being taken in the Betrayal by
[33:20] Judas and here it seems very
[33:23] ordinary you see the the shock and horor
[33:26] on people's faces you see maybe Peter uh
[33:30] grasping him trying to protect him and
[33:33] the soldiers coming to take him away and
[33:36] kavio holding the
[33:37] lantern as he drw drew his own
[33:40] self-portrait in this picture this was
[33:42] considered where's the glory in this
[33:44] where's the awe where's the
[33:47] Wonder this one caused a tremendous
[33:50] stir the death of the Virgin paints a
[33:54] picture that portrays the death of Mary
[33:57] and her she's bloated and and dying and
[34:00] people are Weeping and it shows this
[34:02] sorrow and as you zoom in on the image
[34:04] this is no way to present Mary Mary the
[34:07] Mother of God the holy virgin you don't
[34:09] portray her like this Barefoot
[34:12] dead
[34:14] weeping I'm noticing maybe the color is
[34:16] a little bit better over here um I I
[34:20] threw out the idea of buying the biggest
[34:22] one we could find put in it here for
[34:23] this series so we could at least get
[34:24] some accurate portrayal of all this this
[34:27] art wor sharing but there's a this would
[34:30] be they would say this is not even
[34:32] scripturally accurate this isn't the
[34:34] image we want to portray but it's taking
[34:37] something very real something scriptural
[34:40] and scriptural people and big biblical
[34:42] figures and instead of presenting them
[34:44] as being so far beyond normal that
[34:47] they're unrelatable but just putting it
[34:49] in simple mundane they called it
[34:54] profane in this painting of Matthew and
[34:56] the angel caught of AIO paints Matthew
[34:58] in a way that they thought was very
[35:00] disrespectful Barefoot dressed as a
[35:02] commoner and as he writes this Angel
[35:04] guiding his hand showing him how to
[35:07] write and we'd say well that would be
[35:08] true I mean he didn't write these things
[35:10] on his own but it was stripping Matthew
[35:14] of this awe and this respect and this
[35:16] reverence he was no longer
[35:19] sacred which brings us to our
[35:24] text and
[35:28] if we could use I'm wanting to start
[35:31] here to go
[35:32] further in how God is hidden God hidden
[35:36] in profanity this painting is the
[35:38] calling of St Matthew and in this scene
[35:41] you have the tax collectors and you have
[35:45] Jesus and that's Peter and even in the
[35:48] way that he painted Peter it's almost as
[35:49] if he's just joined joined to Christ you
[35:53] can even notice by the way that kagio
[35:56] has Jesus pointing it reminds you of
[35:59] Michelangelo's uh sis Chapel H uh and uh
[36:04] the creation and the creation of Adam
[36:06] and some say it could be some homage
[36:09] connection
[36:10] there and in this Jesus is in the
[36:14] shadows he's pointing to the table and
[36:17] these young these older Tax Collectors
[36:19] here are so busy counting they don't
[36:22] know him the young ones their face
[36:23] turned looking towards Christ as he
[36:26] points at and there's this figure that
[36:29] may be Matthew he's pointing are you
[36:31] pointing at me am I the one that you're
[36:34] calling in this moment are you reaching
[36:36] out to me and there's a way that you can
[36:38] look at this art and begin to look at it
[36:40] maybe I'm not really I'm a poser right I
[36:41] mean I I I for whatever reasons I enjoy
[36:44] it I just do and I wish I could explain
[36:46] it but there's a way that maybe someone
[36:48] would look at this critically and they
[36:50] notice as I was studying it myself that
[36:52] the window has somewhat of a cross in it
[36:54] but yet there's no light coming through
[36:56] that the light emanates from where Jesus
[36:59] is there's a slight Halo above his head
[37:02] to to let us know that this this is
[37:04] Christ who's now calling
[37:07] Matthew and what struck me and stood out
[37:10] to me is the fact that all each one of
[37:12] these Tax Collectors are dressed in 16th
[37:15] century G uh Ro uh dress it's
[37:19] updated it so if someone was looking at
[37:21] this they would maybe recognize this as
[37:23] being uh Elite clothing or the rich or
[37:26] or somebody in government someone maybe
[37:28] Tax Collector's outfits and they'd be
[37:31] set apart from the regular masses they
[37:34] would be the publicans of the 16th
[37:36] century or the 1500s but yet here's
[37:38] Jesus in a form a a first century Decor
[37:42] we dressed and dressed in first century
[37:44] clothing and he's pointing calling in
[37:46] the modern day in that time to those who
[37:49] looked like everyone else saying Matthew
[37:51] I'm calling you
[38:00] in Luke 5: 27-30 this is just zooming in
[38:05] on the face of Christ now when I when I
[38:08] look at that and I know what cavaj was
[38:12] wanting to
[38:13] portray and that looks so different than
[38:16] what sacred art would want to
[38:19] portray it it it has a realness to it it
[38:23] has a shape and a form that would say he
[38:25] was a man like I was a
[38:28] man he looked like a man he dressed like
[38:31] a man he acted like a man the story says
[38:34] and after these things he went forth and
[38:36] saw a Publican named Levi sitting at the
[38:38] receipt of custom and he said unto him
[38:40] follow me and he left all rose up and
[38:44] followed
[38:46] him and he left all rose up and followed
[38:49] him and Levi made him a great feast in
[38:51] his own
[38:53] house and there was great company of
[38:56] publicans and of others that sat down
[38:57] with him but their scribes and Pharisees
[39:00] murmured against his disciples saying
[39:02] why do ye eat and drink with publicans
[39:05] and
[39:06] sinners remember the Pharisees I think
[39:09] the ter phrase we used last year was
[39:10] were skilled in the art of showing off
[39:13] yeah and here Jesus who is kind of an
[39:18] upand Comer and on the scene coming on
[39:20] the scene is one who's different and
[39:22] gaining a following and H he's teaching
[39:25] and he's saying things that are hard to
[39:26] be understood and he has his disciples
[39:28] he has his following and so the critic
[39:30] the skeptic the Pharisees and the
[39:32] scribes they they were of the school of
[39:34] the Sacred art they were of the school
[39:37] of things being separate and elevated
[39:39] and distinct and now Christ who is a
[39:42] teacher and this Rabbi he is now hanging
[39:44] out with the Publican Sinners the
[39:46] publicans and sinners who are profane
[39:48] they're
[39:49] unworthy they're
[39:52] common remember how the Pharisees in
[39:54] Matthew 23:5 but all their Works they do
[39:57] for to be seen of men they make broad
[40:00] their felies and enlarge the borders of
[40:02] their garments it was conspicuous it was
[40:05] uh unnatural
[40:07] proportions they wanted to convey in
[40:10] their act the actual way that they
[40:11] conducted themselves something that was
[40:15] unearthly something that was Grand and
[40:18] something that was sacred they could if
[40:20] they could they would have wore gold
[40:21] Halos if they could they would have
[40:23] signified to everyone else we're special
[40:25] we're holy we're Elite
[40:28] and so when Christ was there with these
[40:30] tax collectors and these Sinners they
[40:32] were saying here is one who claims to be
[40:33] a teacher here's one who claims to know
[40:36] the things of God but yet now he finds
[40:38] himself surrounded by those who are not
[40:41] like us who are different than we
[40:45] are he is joining himself to the profane
[40:49] the common the everyday
[40:53] folk in the Old Testament and under the
[40:55] law
[40:59] God was beyond
[41:01] man he was separate he was
[41:03] unapproachable the Bible even told us
[41:05] can't even look on him in Exodus 3: 1-6
[41:09] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[41:11] father the priest of Midian and he led
[41:13] the flock to the backside of the desert
[41:15] and came to the Mountain of God even to
[41:18] horb even this designation of the
[41:21] Mountain of God has made something which
[41:23] was totally natural that anyone would
[41:26] have looked upon and said that's a
[41:27] mountain but now we ascribe to it some
[41:30] sacredness it is the Mountain of God it
[41:33] is it happens because it becomes the
[41:35] Mountain of God because God identifies
[41:37] himself with it and so what we do and
[41:40] this is maybe a religious instinct is
[41:42] that something that would have been just
[41:44] totally natural now gets separated out
[41:47] as something
[41:48] sacred and the angel Lord appeared unto
[41:51] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[41:53] of a bush and he looked and behold the
[41:55] bush burned with fire and the Bush was
[41:58] not consumed and Moses said I will now
[42:01] turn aside and see this great sight why
[42:03] the bush is not burnt what's happening
[42:05] something beyond the senses the knowable
[42:08] Moses is drawn to it in the sense of
[42:10] saying okay this is Way Beyond
[42:15] natural and when the Lord saw that he
[42:17] turned aside to see to see God when the
[42:21] Lord saw that he turned aside to see God
[42:23] called him out of the midst of the Bush
[42:24] and said Moses Moses and he said here I
[42:28] and notice God saying
[42:30] immediately he said draw not nigh hither
[42:34] you've come so far enough put off thy
[42:37] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[42:39] whereon thou standest is Holy
[42:42] Ground okay what made it Holy
[42:44] Ground why was it holy why was it sacred
[42:48] why was it separate was it not profane
[42:51] dirt was it not just common everyday
[42:53] gravel and rock and sand moreover he
[42:56] said I am the god of th father the god
[42:57] of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god
[42:59] of Jacob in Moses hid his face for he
[43:01] was afraid to look upon God this had now
[43:05] become a sacred space we see this in the
[43:08] life of Jacob when he says this is the
[43:10] very gate to heaven it became a Sacred
[43:12] Space we find these different instances
[43:14] when God appeared the ground where he
[43:16] appeared the place where he appeared it
[43:18] becomes sacred it becomes set apart
[43:20] that's Holy Ground there's nothing about
[43:23] it that made it more holy other than the
[43:25] fact that the Divine manifested himself
[43:27] in that vicinity or there became
[43:30] respected it became
[43:32] revered what we see happening in the
[43:34] scriptures that God manifest himself in
[43:36] a reality that's completely different
[43:38] from the natural order of
[43:40] things he manifests himself and I want
[43:43] to use the word
[43:44] reality that is
[43:47] unreal he manifest himself in a way that
[43:50] is against Natural reality or that is
[43:52] not profane it is not common
[43:57] and we find this in religion and it's
[43:59] man's Instinct both for good and bad
[44:02] that whenever the sacred is seen or
[44:03] manifested in the ordinary religion
[44:06] tends to separate
[44:08] it if there's something that happens uh
[44:12] and it's supernatural there's this uh
[44:14] veneration towards it and so the sacred
[44:19] in our own language becomes that which
[44:20] is the opposite of the
[44:22] profane and we could say that the
[44:24] profane is essentially without God
[44:28] that if this is the Mountain of God it's
[44:29] the Mountain of God and it's sacred
[44:30] because God's there something is sacred
[44:34] because there's something Divine there
[44:35] something Beyond ourselves the temple
[44:37] and the Tabernacle exactly this way and
[44:39] that the the secret place of the
[44:41] Tabernacle was secret it was hidden from
[44:43] view it was sacred the temple and all
[44:46] the instruments therein were sacred they
[44:47] were devoted to God they could not be
[44:49] defiled they had to be washed they had
[44:50] to be handled in a particular
[44:52] way but this God of the Old Testament
[44:54] who would tell Moses you've gone far far
[44:57] enough take off your shoes show
[44:59] reverence respect this ground this dirt
[45:03] this sand this mountain show respect to
[45:05] it what God is showing with each step
[45:08] and each Evolution we were reading in a
[45:10] devotion last night it was so beautiful
[45:12] how the writer took this H uh this this
[45:15] progression through the scripture and
[45:17] how it culminates even to the Book of
[45:19] Revelation H uh through the Old
[45:21] Testament the New Testament showing just
[45:22] how rich God was unfolding
[45:24] himself God was condescending to place
[45:28] where profane
[45:29] reality would actually hide the
[45:33] sacred that it wouldn't be this mountain
[45:36] of God because you couldn't touch it God
[45:39] would speak from it it so transcended
[45:40] who you were that there was this
[45:42] reverence and there was this all because
[45:44] you couldn't deny that something was
[45:45] manifested beyond our
[45:48] reality and therefore it was sacred and
[45:50] it became sacred God wanted to cause his
[45:53] sacredness to be so one with profanity
[45:58] that the profanity would actually hide
[46:00] the
[46:01] deity and in Jesus Christ God was hidden
[46:04] in the
[46:05] profane I know that seems to be a tough
[46:08] language but he was hid in an ordinary
[46:11] common looking
[46:13] man not Head and Shoulders above
[46:15] everybody
[46:16] else not with the permanent Halo behind
[46:19] his
[46:20] head there's a way that I think it's in
[46:23] the uh there's a way that Christ can be
[46:26] portrayed where he's so glorious and and
[46:30] gorgeous and charismatic to it's like I
[46:33] mean I'd follow the guy I mean this is
[46:36] this is a charismatic figure but yet in
[46:39] him that wasn't the drawing
[46:42] card John but yet in John chap
[46:46] 10:33 want you notice
[46:48] how how much the offense of associating
[46:53] the sacred and the Divine with the human
[46:55] how much of an offense that was
[46:57] John 10:33 the Jews answered him saying
[47:00] for good work we Stone thee not he says
[47:01] you Stone me because I do these
[47:03] wonderful Works they're like you know
[47:04] what this is my words maybe we can't
[47:07] explain that but there's one thing that
[47:09] we will Stone you for and that's for
[47:11] blasphemy because that thou being a man
[47:14] maketh thyself
[47:17] god you being a man make being profane
[47:21] make yourself
[47:23] sacred you being nothing but dust and
[47:25] Ashes you being a like everybody else
[47:28] you actually kind of maybe being
[47:29] illegitimate you we know your family we
[47:31] know everyone around you you being
[47:33] profane make yourself Sacred by saying
[47:36] that you're the Son of God and that
[47:39] you're one with the father that there's
[47:41] something separate about you something
[47:43] sacred about you and think of it in
[47:45] terms of a Pharisee who make broad their
[47:47] felies and they broaden the borders of
[47:50] their garments and there wouldd be some
[47:51] virtue signaling where it's like hey
[47:53] look at me I'm separate I'm distinct I'm
[47:55] holy and Jes like look at you you hang
[47:58] out with uh Republicans you hang out
[48:01] with Sinners you hang out with all these
[48:03] folks it's publicans not Republicans
[48:05] people are all right now going with
[48:06] where's the Democrat
[48:08] scripture did I say Democrats Or
[48:11] democrats there there's a way that you
[48:13] look at it and and you say well there's
[48:15] nothing what what about you sacred and
[48:17] you just say that you're the Son of God
[48:20] and you being profane make yourself
[48:22] sacred you're worthy to be stoned but
[48:25] the Bible tells us in Philippians
[48:26] chapter 2: 5 to8 having read this Mo
[48:29] recently we'll just go through it he
[48:31] would made himself of no reputation took
[48:34] on the form of a servant was made in the
[48:36] likeness of men being found in fashion
[48:39] as a man he humbled
[48:40] himself in other words the one who was
[48:43] in the form of God and was equal with
[48:45] God he was in and of himself by virtue
[48:48] of the blood of God be inside of him he
[48:51] was sacred but he took on the form of
[48:53] that which was Unholy he took upon the
[48:55] form of that which was not sacred he was
[48:58] born of a
[48:59] woman and traveled through in the birth
[49:03] process the same way that everyone else
[49:05] was intended to be born or that would be
[49:07] born and in doing so he identified
[49:09] himself so completely with Humanity that
[49:12] he was to the eye fully and 100%
[49:19] profane but yet in Mark 12: 35-37 the
[49:23] Son of God Christ Jesus the Messiah
[49:29] the very one they were all looking to
[49:32] he's he he's the sacred order the
[49:35] scribes and the
[49:36] Pharisees and the Sadducees they knew
[49:39] the word they knew the law and everyone
[49:40] was beholden to them and they would go
[49:42] and they'd sit in their synagogues and
[49:43] they would hear their rabbis and their
[49:45] teachers there was this Rich framework
[49:47] of uh dispensing truths and teaching and
[49:49] asking questions and discourse so
[49:51] everyone could know and it was a
[49:53] repeated process uh uh for one to one
[49:56] with be elevated to master so that they
[49:58] would have the answers to everyone's
[49:59] questions cuz nobody else could really
[50:01] know and
[50:02] understand and there was tribunals and
[50:05] there was decisions and there was
[50:06] criticisms and there was ways of
[50:08] moderating public Behavior but here in
[50:10] Mark CH 12 Jesus Christ who was sacred
[50:14] who was the son of God was found in the
[50:16] form of a man and he doesn't just
[50:18] present an image as a man but now he's
[50:21] relatable as a man and Jesus answered
[50:24] and said while he taught in the temple
[50:26] how sa the describes that Christ is the
[50:27] Son of God for David himself said by the
[50:30] Holy Ghost the Lord said to my Lord sit
[50:32] thou on my right hand till I make thine
[50:34] enemies thine enemies thy foot stol
[50:36] David therefore himself called him Lord
[50:39] and whence is he then his son asking the
[50:42] real questions now right this is how the
[50:44] scribes and the Pharisees and and the
[50:47] Sadducees and the teachers and the
[50:48] rabbis they wanted things to almost
[50:51] always be a little bit Out Of
[50:53] Reach and then catch this tagline
[50:58] here when he's speaking this doesn't
[51:01] become a riddle that tickles the
[51:02] people's ears it says and the Common
[51:05] People heard him
[51:08] gladly in other words there was no
[51:10] distinction among the
[51:12] elite there was no high social hierarchy
[51:16] where only the scribes and only the
[51:17] Pharisees and only those who knew the
[51:19] word and knew the law could understand
[51:21] him but everyone could understand him
[51:25] the common people suggest a a large
[51:28] multitude of everyone so it's not saying
[51:30] commoners of the poor or and there's
[51:32] this distinction between the peasants
[51:34] and the bougie it was it was nothing in
[51:37] that way it was to say hey this is
[51:40] everyone could hear them and understand
[51:42] them there they were not socially
[51:46] elect there was no Elite Class that they
[51:49] belonged
[51:51] to in order to hear
[51:54] him and I would say this as a caution to
[51:58] those of us who believe so strongly that
[52:01] we are
[52:02] elect that we are called and we have
[52:04] been
[52:06] chosen that we not make the
[52:12] mistake of believing ourselves to be
[52:16] so Elite by
[52:19] election that we lose our connection
[52:21] with our
[52:23] Humanity in a very dark place yes in in
[52:28] a way to where we have ascribed to
[52:30] ourselves absolute immunity and 100%
[52:35] sacredness And in doing so if you truly
[52:37] are indeed elect it's not going to
[52:39] diminish your election but it diminishes
[52:41] Your Capacity to be
[52:45] effective brother brandham said and sir
[52:47] we would see Jesus we know we wouldn't
[52:50] find him as a great educator we don't
[52:53] even have any record of him ever going
[52:55] to school and he wouldn't be a different
[52:58] dressed man because he went in and out
[53:00] among
[53:01] men people didn't know him all of them
[53:04] dressed alike he didn't dress like a
[53:07] priest he didn't dress like a religious
[53:09] man he dressed just like an
[53:12] ordinary
[53:15] man this is not i' say this as a caution
[53:19] maybe this caveat before we go forward
[53:20] it's not that we would strive to fit in
[53:23] and look ordinary especially when the
[53:25] things the sense of that which is
[53:27] ordinary continues to
[53:29] change but it's to recognize that Jesus
[53:32] Christ dressed as an ordinary man lived
[53:34] as an ordinary man presented as an
[53:36] ordinary
[53:37] man and didn't wear
[53:41] garments that in themselves signified
[53:44] some virtue I being better than everyone
[53:46] else or a turned collar into this
[53:49] distinct class but he was declaring
[53:53] God in a way that God could be knowable
[53:58] was God hidden in
[54:00] profanity 1 John 1:2 it says it this way
[54:03] that which was from the beginning which
[54:04] we have heard which we have seen with
[54:06] our eyes which we have looked upon and
[54:10] our hands have
[54:11] handled of the Word of Life in other
[54:14] words we could touch it we could feel it
[54:16] we could understand it we could relate
[54:18] with it it wasn't a mountain that we
[54:20] stood a far off from it wasn't a God in
[54:24] and some uh hovering in the sky that was
[54:27] so bright we had to cover our eyes and
[54:29] that was so so glorious and so powerful
[54:33] that we just had to hide ourselves but
[54:35] yet it was so normal we could see it we
[54:38] can look upon it we can handle it it
[54:39] says of the word of
[54:41] life so the word of life it says in
[54:44] verse two was manifested and we have
[54:46] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[54:48] you that eternal life which was with the
[54:50] father and was manifested unto
[54:53] us manifested unto us
[54:57] how it wasn't merely the words it wasn't
[55:00] these great Miracles what was it that
[55:02] caused the phes to want to Stone Jesus
[55:06] not for the works he did because they
[55:08] did seem to be sacred but it was when
[55:10] the sacred had becomed enveloped in
[55:12] humanity and it was identified with the
[55:15] man not some one-off not some outlier
[55:17] not some sort of power that was working
[55:19] externally of him from him but rather I
[55:22] am one with Divine I am s SEC because
[55:27] God has chosen
[55:29] me that want that's what made them want
[55:31] to Stone
[55:32] him so the Word of Life which John said
[55:35] he saw wasn't the external
[55:39] things wasn't the we held the bread that
[55:42] he uh broke and multiplied we ate the
[55:45] fish that he multiplied we we saw the
[55:47] water that he walked upon but God had
[55:50] become
[55:51] tangible in a
[55:54] person human religion makes Christ Out
[55:58] Of
[55:59] Reach human religion takes the word of
[56:02] God and always puts it just a little bit
[56:04] beyond grasp it wants to be attractive
[56:07] enough to make you reach for it but once
[56:10] you get closer you realize you can never
[56:11] achieve it and that was the goal of
[56:14] sacred art get the people pining get
[56:16] them reaching get them longing get them
[56:18] so inspired in thought provoked to where
[56:20] they're constantly trying to chase the
[56:22] dragon and and get that high and be a
[56:25] struck and inspired and but always just
[56:27] keep it a little bit Out Of
[56:30] Reach but just like cardio's
[56:33] art in Christ the word was reaching out
[56:37] to the
[56:39] profane it wasn't religion that was
[56:41] causing people to merely reach
[56:43] themselves and the end being like oh
[56:45] sorry you're just a little short you
[56:47] can't reach it but just as in the art
[56:49] there was this response or there's this
[56:52] movement to make the the scriptures
[56:54] relatable to the profane the common to
[56:56] present it ways to where it probably
[56:58] actually
[56:59] was and doing so it was God was in
[57:04] Christ reaching
[57:06] out the sacred was in the profane
[57:09] reaching out to the profane saying you
[57:12] can be one with the
[57:15] sacred it completely changes the
[57:17] Dynamics of how God is wanting to reveal
[57:20] himself in Ephesians chap 2: 13- 14 but
[57:24] now in Christ Jesus ye who saw sometimes
[57:26] we're far off are made nigh by the blood
[57:29] of Christ for he is our peace who ha
[57:33] made both
[57:35] one and have broken down the middle wall
[57:37] of partition between
[57:40] us literally this is so real through
[57:43] Christ the division between the sacred
[57:45] and profane is
[57:47] abolished he broke down that middle wall
[57:49] of partition where there was always this
[57:51] all struck wonder of the Sacred place
[57:53] the temple the the instruments the
[57:55] priesthood
[57:56] the Levites all this great beautiful
[57:59] gold and Grandeur which is somehow
[58:01] mirrored then in false religion and
[58:03] Christianity and there's this divide
[58:05] between the religion and Christianity
[58:07] and the secular and that divide is so
[58:09] distinct that we who are just secular
[58:11] human beings can only achieve some sort
[58:14] of nonsecular identity by professing
[58:16] that the sacred and the church and
[58:19] religion is Right In Christ is real but
[58:21] we never have a genuine experience with
[58:24] it it's never reality it's all theater
[58:29] but through Christ that distinction is
[58:33] abolished because according to the word
[58:35] of God the profane can be
[58:37] Sanctified and become a Dwelling Place
[58:41] of the
[58:43] Sacred in 1 Corinthians chapter 1:
[58:47] 26-31 I thank you each of you all of you
[58:50] for holding so closely to what I'm
[58:53] saying in your patience thank you for
[58:55] your continued patience we're getting
[58:56] very close to wrapping up here 1
[58:59] Corinthians chap 1:
[59:01] 26-31 I maybe I can just poll everyone
[59:05] you just we won't do yays and nays and
[59:07] raise hands but just want to pull you is
[59:10] it making some spiritual sense to you
[59:12] today is there some connection where we
[59:15] use we're using art art which is to
[59:19] me uh all of us can appreciate it or
[59:21] recognize it there's certain principles
[59:22] that seem to be very that are natural
[59:25] we're wanting to use it as a way of
[59:27] getting your attention to draw you into
[59:29] a scriptural
[59:30] truth that is real in this hour very
[59:34] very
[59:36] real the dividing line between the
[59:38] sacred and the
[59:40] profane that there's a theory there's a
[59:44] a discipline a school of thought that
[59:45] says always present God in a way to
[59:48] where he's not knowable and not being
[59:50] able to be known all you are is in
[59:54] awe and then every everything else is
[59:56] worldly profane natural and keep the two
[1:00:01] separate when God all along was wanting
[1:00:03] to cause the two to come
[1:00:06] together to where there's still an awe
[1:00:09] and reverence but he's now
[1:00:12] knowable he becomes relatable it becomes
[1:00:15] reality and you realize the only reality
[1:00:17] is that which exists in
[1:00:20] God for you see your
[1:00:24] calling did I uh
[1:00:27] okay I I say did I fin I thought maybe I
[1:00:30] messed up excuse me for you see your
[1:00:32] calling Brethren how that not many wise
[1:00:34] men after the flesh not many mighty not
[1:00:36] many noble are
[1:00:38] called but God ha chosen the foolish
[1:00:40] things of the world to confound the wise
[1:00:44] and God have chosen the weak things of
[1:00:45] the world to confound the things which
[1:00:47] are Mighty very very tremendous
[1:00:51] truths and base things of the world and
[1:00:56] things which are despised hath God
[1:00:58] Chosen and here comes the real kicker
[1:01:00] yay and things which are
[1:01:05] not you know what that phrase refers to
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:09] profane the things which are
[1:01:12] not is not a a a reference to things
[1:01:15] that do not exist so that God refer is
[1:01:18] using things that don't exist to bring
[1:01:20] not things that are but the things that
[1:01:22] are not it was a phrase that was used by
[1:01:24] the Jews to describe
[1:01:28] Gentiles they the they were the people
[1:01:30] which were not which were not a people
[1:01:33] is that what the prophet had said the
[1:01:34] things which are not the profane the
[1:01:36] Gentiles the Godless the Unholy they
[1:01:39] were but they weren't sacred they
[1:01:41] existed they had being they had identity
[1:01:43] they had lives but it was wholly
[1:01:45] separate from anything Divine they had
[1:01:47] no caretaker they had no one watching
[1:01:49] over them but the base things of the
[1:01:50] world and the things which are despised
[1:01:52] hath God chosen in other words he's
[1:01:54] chosen the profane the Unholy the
[1:01:56] unsacred in your eyes and the things
[1:01:58] which are not the profane hath he chosen
[1:02:00] to bring the not bring to not the things
[1:02:04] that
[1:02:05] are that no flesh should glory in his
[1:02:09] presence but of him are ye in Christ
[1:02:12] Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom
[1:02:14] and righteousness and sanctification and
[1:02:16] Redemption ye but of him are ye in
[1:02:20] Christ Jesus Christ Jesus whom God has
[1:02:23] made unto us he is wisdom righteousness
[1:02:26] ification and Redemption for us that
[1:02:29] according as it is written he that
[1:02:30] glorieth let him glory in the
[1:02:33] Lord we can Glory but in the Lord we
[1:02:37] don't glory in the profane but glory is
[1:02:39] in the profane so we glorify the Lord if
[1:02:43] I could say it this way I've kind of
[1:02:45] lost my way in my notes this
[1:02:48] morning I just need the Lord's help to
[1:02:50] be able to finish this up but if I could
[1:02:51] say it this way there must be a 21st
[1:02:54] century
[1:02:59] Christ a manifestation of the Sacred in
[1:03:04] humanity and in doing so it's not a
[1:03:06] matter of being
[1:03:07] believable it's not a matter of being
[1:03:10] convincing but it's a question of
[1:03:12] whether or not our lives are making
[1:03:13] Christ
[1:03:15] knowable sure we could do things that
[1:03:17] overtly signal that we believe right we
[1:03:19] could just get big shirts right I'm for
[1:03:22] Christ and we can use a lot of imagery I
[1:03:25] was wear a a sweatshirt the other day
[1:03:27] and and it had God was mentioned on the
[1:03:30] sweatshirt and someone asked me so
[1:03:32] what's what's up with that you know
[1:03:33] what's it for a and I said well it's you
[1:03:36] know I kind of gave the story of the the
[1:03:37] brand a little bit but I said it's a
[1:03:39] reference to scripture about the Breath
[1:03:40] of God and and inspiration and and has
[1:03:43] scripture principle and the response was
[1:03:44] well people just use God anymore for
[1:03:47] just uh uh for no reason they just use
[1:03:51] it right God's becoming common
[1:03:56] I think there's a a popular brand called
[1:03:57] is it fear God or something like that
[1:04:00] and it it has nothing to do with God
[1:04:03] right it's just another iteration of
[1:04:05] FUBU and it and it's there's nothing you
[1:04:09] could wear it someone say oh you fear
[1:04:11] God and and it would be like no I'm
[1:04:13] wearing fear God and who is the god is
[1:04:17] it
[1:04:18] Jesus right there's different there's so
[1:04:20] many Christ figures and Messiah and
[1:04:23] ideologies and we don't have to it's not
[1:04:26] just trying to signal that we're
[1:04:27] Believers and it's not trying to be
[1:04:29] convincing or believable but we have
[1:04:31] Christ has to be
[1:04:33] knowable and if we subscribe to the the
[1:04:36] we subscribe to Sacred Arts then we
[1:04:38] would just try to present ourselves in
[1:04:40] such a way towards like whoa they're
[1:04:43] different and we would never be
[1:04:45] reachable or what we have would never be
[1:04:48] even desired maybe chased after but
[1:04:50] never
[1:04:52] attained even in John chapter 1:10
[1:04:56] he was in the world and the world was
[1:04:58] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:05:00] why did the world not know him because
[1:05:02] he looked toally like the world but he
[1:05:05] wasn't
[1:05:06] worldly he ate like the world he dressed
[1:05:08] like the world he walked through the way
[1:05:09] in the world he he worked in the world
[1:05:11] he ate the things of the world but yet
[1:05:13] he was still separate and
[1:05:17] apart let me say it this way if the
[1:05:19] world's going to miss you let them be
[1:05:21] looking over the top of
[1:05:24] you if the word world's going to miss
[1:05:26] you be so
[1:05:29] ordinary be be so uh uh sensible that
[1:05:34] the world's going to miss you they're
[1:05:35] going to be looking for a 900 foot Jesus
[1:05:38] and the 5 foot n Jesus is standing right
[1:05:40] in front of
[1:05:41] them be be so relatable and so knowable
[1:05:45] that the high and mighty a and the
[1:05:47] lifted up and the educated and the
[1:05:49] intellectual they're looking over the
[1:05:51] top of you so that the one who's broken
[1:05:53] the one that's looking down the one that
[1:05:54] really needs to find them can see you
[1:05:56] and look you in the eye and know Christ
[1:05:58] is
[1:05:59] relatable in John 7:5 I use this to
[1:06:03] support I thought that it's not necessar
[1:06:05] being believable or convincing but being
[1:06:07] relatable that one of the criticisms of
[1:06:09] Christ was for neither did his Brethren
[1:06:11] believe in
[1:06:13] him didn't change who he
[1:06:16] was it's not a matter of us living in
[1:06:18] such a way to where we just we convince
[1:06:20] everybody man they're just so perfect
[1:06:22] they handle everything so right
[1:06:27] but Christ he's knowable in humil
[1:06:30] humility and
[1:06:33] service 1 John chap 4: 2 to 4 this is
[1:06:37] taking some great momentum from last
[1:06:39] Sunday's service which to me again I
[1:06:41] just think was so tremendous hereby know
[1:06:43] ye the spirit of God I didn't preach for
[1:06:45] those who weren't here every spirit that
[1:06:48] confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in
[1:06:50] the flesh is of
[1:06:52] God to confess it's that the the
[1:06:56] prefix con which is with and the in
[1:06:59] logos the
[1:07:01] word to to be with the
[1:07:06] word everyone that confesseth that Jesus
[1:07:09] Christ has come in the flesh is of God
[1:07:10] and every spirit that confesseth not
[1:07:12] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[1:07:13] is not of God and this is that Spirit of
[1:07:15] antichrist whereever you have heard that
[1:07:17] it should come and even now already is
[1:07:19] it in the
[1:07:20] world the spirit that denies that the
[1:07:23] sacred could dwell in the profane
[1:07:27] the spirit that would say that the
[1:07:28] Messiah is unable to
[1:07:31] embody the
[1:07:33] humanity even the spirit that would
[1:07:35] confess that Jesus Christ was born of a
[1:07:38] virgin lived and died and descended
[1:07:40] again but yet Christ is not in flesh
[1:07:43] today is the spirit of antichrist
[1:07:45] because he says ye are of God little
[1:07:46] children and have overcome him because
[1:07:48] greater is he the word Christ that is in
[1:07:51] you than he that is in the world oh it's
[1:07:54] God is come in the flesh how many of us
[1:07:58] travel like a thought to
[1:08:01] work no we don't we may be thinking on
[1:08:04] our way to work some of us may be able
[1:08:05] to just roll over and grab our laptop
[1:08:07] and commence to working but yet we
[1:08:08] realize we are not making our way
[1:08:10] through this world in a way that is
[1:08:13] obviously
[1:08:21] sacred but
[1:08:23] yet he is in you
[1:08:28] I realize it's a tight
[1:08:31] rope I feel that I tend to draw from
[1:08:35] these types of subjects let me close
[1:08:37] with this Christ is identified the same
[1:08:39] in all generations we've been using a
[1:08:42] lot of this
[1:08:45] message now what was
[1:08:47] Jesus the same yesterday today and
[1:08:53] forever he's the same yesterday today
[1:08:55] today and
[1:08:57] forever in what way how what makes him
[1:09:02] the same now this is a statement he
[1:09:05] makes more than once I want you
[1:09:07] to uh when when I read it I don't want
[1:09:11] you just to hear it as you've heard it
[1:09:14] before I don't want you to hear it just
[1:09:16] to say Amen to it but as the word is
[1:09:19] going forth I want you to take each
[1:09:22] piece and get it into your hands and
[1:09:24] look at it and say what what is he
[1:09:26] saying what is God wanting me to
[1:09:29] see I was going to use uh some
[1:09:32] particular slides and I was trying to I
[1:09:34] was actually started trying to figure
[1:09:35] out a way that you could replicate some
[1:09:37] sense of a mirror in a
[1:09:40] slideshow all it was doing is just
[1:09:42] flipping images it was like well this is
[1:09:43] a should just bring out a mirror what
[1:09:46] was Jesus now if he stood here wearing
[1:09:48] this suit that I got
[1:09:50] on that he gave me
[1:09:53] now h if he stood here wearing this
[1:10:00] suit if he sat there wearing what you
[1:10:04] have
[1:10:05] on are you thinking about this when he
[1:10:08] said if he stood here wearing the suit
[1:10:09] that I have on in some ways it's true he
[1:10:13] was standing there he was wearing the
[1:10:16] suit that brother Brenham had on the
[1:10:19] question is as he was in this prayer
[1:10:21] line and he was looking at it from
[1:10:23] another angle he said if the woman is
[1:10:25] sick could he heal
[1:10:27] her if Christ is living
[1:10:31] today wearing the clothes that you have
[1:10:34] on could he heal someone who is sick he
[1:10:37] says be
[1:10:39] careful now be careful no he could not
[1:10:43] do it and if we stopped the tape right
[1:10:46] then and there we would because we were
[1:10:48] so frustrated we'd miss the point he has
[1:10:50] already done
[1:10:51] it so if God is here today Liv living in
[1:10:56] flesh it's not that he has to go back
[1:10:59] and do things that are already
[1:11:02] done he if he's here now in the suit
[1:11:05] brother B says if he's on this platform
[1:11:07] Christ in flesh wearing a suit not a
[1:11:10] robe not Thorn prints not a crow but
[1:11:12] he's wearing something that we would
[1:11:14] expect someone in that situation to be
[1:11:16] wearing he couldn't heal because he's
[1:11:18] already done it he quotes the scripture
[1:11:20] he was wounded for our transgressions by
[1:11:22] his stripes we are healed he has already
[1:11:24] done it right the only thing he could
[1:11:29] do would just identify himself to her is
[1:11:34] that right and make it known that he's
[1:11:36] raised from the dead and alive and now
[1:11:39] that he would identify
[1:11:43] himself we could take these different
[1:11:45] scenarios and expand them a little bit
[1:11:47] further brother brandham said If God Was
[1:11:50] Here Christ was here in my flesh wear in
[1:11:53] this suit that I have on he couldn't
[1:11:55] heal you but he could perform a
[1:11:58] sign and do something that is obviously
[1:12:02] Divine and sacred and identify himself
[1:12:05] with the flesh so that he could awake
[1:12:07] something in you to believe the word
[1:12:08] which has been written and to believe
[1:12:10] for something that has already happened
[1:12:12] and so I say the same thing to you today
[1:12:15] echoing what brother brandham said that
[1:12:17] if Christ was here right now in the
[1:12:20] clothes that you have on if you are the
[1:12:23] word made flesh today we don't need to
[1:12:26] stand on a platform and perform
[1:12:28] discernment because it's already been
[1:12:30] done we don't need to go back and die on
[1:12:33] a cross it is not a matter of Christ
[1:12:35] healing today but it's identifying
[1:12:38] himself through you to where he can be
[1:12:43] believed believe for what he
[1:12:46] promised God hidden in
[1:12:49] profanity the word becoming a reality in
[1:12:53] ordinary everyday life
[1:12:56] I know I'm repeating myself over and
[1:12:58] over and over again I've done it for
[1:12:59] four
[1:13:00] years and I could just blame the church
[1:13:04] is growing so we got to start over you
[1:13:05] know every time
[1:13:07] we but let me say this I haven't called
[1:13:09] the musicians because I want everyone to
[1:13:11] to focus on these these last few things
[1:13:14] I just I wrote this down specifically
[1:13:16] last night as one of the last things I
[1:13:18] just wanted to summarize this with this
[1:13:19] is our challenge
[1:13:21] now this is my challenge to you
[1:13:25] is to be Godly enough to be
[1:13:27] separate but human enough to be
[1:13:32] relatable sacred enough to be
[1:13:35] separate Sanctified enough holy enough
[1:13:39] to be separate to not be
[1:13:43] worldly but existing enough in the world
[1:13:46] that you can make God
[1:13:49] known yeah it may seem to be kind of
[1:13:52] heavy clunky words and we could find a
[1:13:54] different way of say saying it flesh
[1:13:56] becoming word in different ways that we
[1:13:57] could say it but it's the sacred in
[1:14:00] profanity you're expressing
[1:14:03] sacredness but you're doing it through
[1:14:05] you through a
[1:14:06] life and as I've shared this with a
[1:14:08] number of I say a number a handful of
[1:14:10] people and I've tried to express my
[1:14:12] heart is different the feedback comes in
[1:14:14] the fellowship I love to fellowship on
[1:14:15] these things I don't love to fellowship
[1:14:17] on it so I could be told that was an
[1:14:19] excellent sermon I like to be
[1:14:20] fellowshipping on the content and I
[1:14:22] enjoy that I learn from it I grow from
[1:14:24] it I I get feedback often times where I
[1:14:27] realize well I didn't see that angle
[1:14:29] that's probably what the real angle was
[1:14:31] or I get feedback sometimes this was I
[1:14:34] didn't quite understand this part I
[1:14:35] enjoyed the fellowship on it and so I'll
[1:14:37] try to express to you as I
[1:14:40] close in this idea of God hidden in
[1:14:44] profanity throughout history there have
[1:14:46] been attempts to express Divine things
[1:14:50] in the scripture in the Bible and there
[1:14:53] was a there was a thought
[1:14:55] that you had to express the Divine in
[1:14:59] ways and I'm I I know I'm repeating
[1:15:01] myself but in a way that was always just
[1:15:03] Out Of Reach because it was
[1:15:05] Supernatural it was sacred it was holy
[1:15:07] it was beyond us Beyond normal com the
[1:15:12] commoner and then in the Reformation
[1:15:15] where the word which at one time was in
[1:15:16] a language that could only be read by
[1:15:18] the priesthood and there was this
[1:15:19] separation from the church from the
[1:15:21] believer and those in authority and
[1:15:23] those in control the Reformation was
[1:15:25] getting the word back into the hands of
[1:15:26] the people so that they could read it
[1:15:28] and the common people could be glad and
[1:15:30] rejoice in the word of God there was a
[1:15:31] moving away from always trying to
[1:15:33] present the present the Divine in an
[1:15:35] unreachable form but began to present it
[1:15:37] in a way to where you could know him
[1:15:40] know the story and relate to it because
[1:15:42] you were human didn't separate the
[1:15:44] scriptural aspect out of it it didn't
[1:15:45] separate the Divinity from it but it was
[1:15:47] showing that Christ was divine and yet
[1:15:50] human at the same time and the different
[1:15:53] stories of the martyrs and things it was
[1:15:55] painted through these pictures to say
[1:15:56] wow these were humans they were
[1:15:58] overcoming human things and it was to
[1:16:00] make in that sense too there was a way
[1:16:03] that things in that day could the I
[1:16:05] could see the gospel being portrayed
[1:16:08] through that
[1:16:09] art and if we are to be the word made
[1:16:12] flesh today we can't go back to first
[1:16:15] century
[1:16:16] costumes we can't go back to 16th
[1:16:19] century costumes we can't go to church H
[1:16:23] uh uh we can't go to church forms and H
[1:16:25] uh uh priest robes and collars and we
[1:16:28] try to figure out a way to where we can
[1:16:30] signal that we're Christians but God has
[1:16:33] to find a way to express himself in the
[1:16:36] 21st century if we all wore leather
[1:16:39] sandals and robes grew beards and
[1:16:42] dressed ourselves in a certain way and
[1:16:44] we walked everywhere we went and we
[1:16:47] tried to be a caricature of an image
[1:16:50] that we've seen from Days Gone By no
[1:16:52] question we get
[1:16:53] attention and a lot of people might
[1:16:55] think you look like a literal Jesus and
[1:16:58] there might be a way that you could
[1:16:59] dress and act to portray some very
[1:17:02] serious zealousness of a Christian but
[1:17:05] my point is this and it's a very
[1:17:07] difficult one to make but God is wanting
[1:17:09] to paint a picture today of the Bride
[1:17:12] that upon first glance you would say
[1:17:14] they're just
[1:17:16] humans right that's just a normal scene
[1:17:20] right that's just that's just a woman
[1:17:23] holding her baby that's just a that's
[1:17:26] just a man who died that's just this
[1:17:28] that's just that but upon closer
[1:17:29] inspection you realize there's more
[1:17:31] going on in this person's life that
[1:17:34] there's more to their character there's
[1:17:36] more to their testimony and there's got
[1:17:38] to be a way I'll I'll I'll pick up on
[1:17:40] this maybe Lord willing Wednesday night
[1:17:41] there's a way that God's going to
[1:17:43] express himself individually through
[1:17:44] each one of
[1:17:46] you the church wants to force this image
[1:17:49] where it's all homogeneous and everyone
[1:17:51] looks the same talks the same and does
[1:17:53] everything the same way but but God is a
[1:17:55] god of variety and he doesn't want us to
[1:17:57] look like lutherans he doesn't want us
[1:17:59] to look like methodists he doesn't want
[1:18:01] us to look like uh people from Indiana
[1:18:03] God wants you to look like a human being
[1:18:07] who has been blessed with the glory of
[1:18:09] God who is Sanctified who is serious
[1:18:11] about the things of
[1:18:13] God and we walk that line to where we
[1:18:16] can be Godly enough to be separate from
[1:18:18] the world but human enough for that that
[1:18:21] godliness to be
[1:18:22] known and I would say this many of us
[1:18:25] have made the mistake of Leaning too far
[1:18:26] into the
[1:18:27] worldliness and there's not enough
[1:18:30] separateness because we rest on the the
[1:18:33] the elitism or the social distinction
[1:18:35] we're
[1:18:36] bride that there's this hidden hidden
[1:18:39] election deep down in my flesh where I
[1:18:41] can do whatever I want in my private
[1:18:44] time in my social time in my Endeavors
[1:18:46] in the way that I handle my finances the
[1:18:47] way that I treat my family in the way
[1:18:49] that I dress the way that I act and the
[1:18:50] things I ingest you name it across the
[1:18:52] board there's some sense that because I
[1:18:54] believe believe I can remain
[1:18:58] profane but that's not the challenge the
[1:19:01] challenge is not
[1:19:03] believing as much as it is being holy
[1:19:07] unto the
[1:19:09] Lord in Christ to the profane who's
[1:19:13] reaching out and not pushing
[1:19:17] away even with our own children to have
[1:19:19] lives that are
[1:19:20] engaging as parents we can't live so
[1:19:23] high and holy to our kids are like
[1:19:25] they're just
[1:19:26] aliens they're not even normal it
[1:19:29] wouldn't surprise me one day if they
[1:19:30] just ripped off the mask one day and
[1:19:32] there was a mini UFO operating
[1:19:36] them but then and then again we don't
[1:19:38] want to be so
[1:19:40] worldly you know that's one of our
[1:19:42] challenges right now in our home it's
[1:19:43] telling telling my kids that we have a
[1:19:46] home phone which actually happens to be
[1:19:47] a cell phone it's like stay off your
[1:19:49] phone
[1:19:50] please get off your phone dude right and
[1:19:54] so my only argument in Needmore is I
[1:19:56] don't want you to be like me hey I don't
[1:19:59] want you to grow up to be like
[1:20:01] me don't take my phone
[1:20:04] away hey there's going to be a day when
[1:20:06] you can't take the phone
[1:20:10] away and you don't want to be perceived
[1:20:11] as somebody who's never owned a phone
[1:20:14] does can't relate doesn't know what's
[1:20:15] going on so strict so
[1:20:18] austere so unworldly that you're not
[1:20:20] even human anymore
[1:20:25] and the
[1:20:26] sacred is never
[1:20:29] known it's just thought about it's just
[1:20:33] reverenced God help us to be him hidden
[1:20:38] in
[1:20:39] profanity could we stand together
[1:20:41] musicians you could come we'll bow our
[1:20:44] heads in a word of
[1:20:50] prayer I was looking for brother Michael
[1:20:54] I might want to turn turn it over to
[1:21:05] him let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:21:07] of Prayer
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:37] our gracious Heavenly
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:41] Father you've been so good to
[1:21:44] us you're kind you're
[1:21:48] faithful and we can in our own lives
[1:21:51] testify that we have witnessed
[1:21:54] the
[1:21:56] sacred we've
[1:21:59] seen seen you manifested in situations
[1:22:02] and
[1:22:04] circumstances we've seen you manifested
[1:22:06] in
[1:22:08] settings and we cannot deny that there's
[1:22:11] a real God there's something
[1:22:15] Supernatural but Lord the greatest of
[1:22:17] all experiences is when we're born again
[1:22:20] by the Holy Ghost and that which was
[1:22:22] always separate and that which was was
[1:22:24] always just a little bit Out Of Reach
[1:22:25] and undeniable then becomes a personal
[1:22:30] experience where we can know
[1:22:33] you and I believe father that your goal
[1:22:36] is that from that Divine spark that's
[1:22:38] ignited at the time that we're born
[1:22:40] again it's your desire that you would
[1:22:42] have preeminence in our
[1:22:45] lives so that we could become the
[1:22:48] ultimate
[1:22:49] expression of the
[1:22:52] Divine walking on water
[1:22:56] Halo effects and pillars of fire
[1:22:59] and tremendous signs and wonders and
[1:23:02] miracles all declare a sacred God who is
[1:23:06] unlike
[1:23:11] us but the greatest manifestation of the
[1:23:14] word of God
[1:23:16] today is the message that says we can be
[1:23:19] like
[1:23:21] you that we ourselves
[1:23:26] could be a bearer of your
[1:23:28] light that through the work of the
[1:23:30] calvary the shedding of blood the
[1:23:32] abolishment of the division between the
[1:23:34] sacred and the profane the profane have
[1:23:37] access now to the
[1:23:39] Divine not to visit not to enjoy in a
[1:23:42] church service but to commune with and
[1:23:45] fellowship
[1:23:47] with and Lord there's a way that the
[1:23:49] world looks and we don't need to look
[1:23:51] like that
[1:23:55] but what do you look like
[1:23:58] today why has the word been so precise
[1:24:01] why was it preserved in this
[1:24:04] hour and taught and restored
[1:24:08] back and even demonstrated and lived why
[1:24:11] why did you do it the way that you did
[1:24:12] it
[1:24:13] today I believe lord it's because you
[1:24:16] want a 21st century
[1:24:19] Christ just as Jesus walked as a
[1:24:23] Nazarene and he walked as a Jew he
[1:24:25] walked as a son of Mary and Joseph and
[1:24:27] there was so much about him that was
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:35] common there needs to be a lot of stuff
[1:24:39] about us that's
[1:24:43] common and Lord wherever it is we need
[1:24:45] our help whether it is to be more Divine
[1:24:47] and more like you or to be less arrogant
[1:24:50] and prideful and more human just keep
[1:24:54] working work on us Lord to make us what
[1:24:56] we ought to
[1:25:00] be Lord we love you we commit ourselves
[1:25:03] to you today I know there's great needs
[1:25:04] in our hearts I know the service has
[1:25:07] extended quite some time Beyond what's
[1:25:09] normal but Lord it
[1:25:11] was good for me to share these
[1:25:14] things and I hope that it's even Lord if
[1:25:17] I examine my own self by my thesis
[1:25:20] statement Lord I trust that the word is
[1:25:21] being relatable and knowable approach
[1:25:24] able Lord we love you we ask all these
[1:25:27] things today in the name of the Lord
[1:25:28] Jesus Christ
[1:25:30] amen amen praise Lord
