[0:00] on the subject of Christ my healer we're
[0:03] going to touch on um we still kind of
[0:07] laying the foundation in this and
[0:09] haven't maybe got as far as we would
[0:10] like to get um in this subject matter
[0:14] but today we want to just take a step
[0:16] further this is part four of Christ my
[0:18] healer and we're looking specifically at
[0:21] the promise of Divine Healing as it says
[0:24] here they shall lay hands on the sick
[0:26] and they shall recover just as much as
[0:28] you couldn't take out back baptism in
[0:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ out of
[0:31] the scripture you cannot take Divine
[0:34] Healing out of the scripture and so I
[0:36] really desire that we could be rooted
[0:38] and grounded in this absolute promise of
[0:41] God to heal it is God's promise
[0:43] recognize it place it scripturally and
[0:46] we haven't even got to that point yet to
[0:47] where we can really start digging into
[0:50] uh the mechanics of Divine Healing and
[0:51] God's promise to heal and the different
[0:53] ways that it's used in the scripture and
[0:56] represented uh and and so ultimately
[0:58] you'd even want to look at how to
[1:00] receive Divine Healing how to have your
[1:01] faith positioned to receive it but we're
[1:04] focusing more right now on its purpose
[1:06] what's the purpose of Divine Healing and
[1:09] so today I recognize at the outset so if
[1:12] at some point you're like man brother
[1:13] Aaron's just repeated himself I realize
[1:15] that and so maybe that's all it takes is
[1:17] for me to notice or know that I'm
[1:19] repeating myself to make it feel better
[1:20] for you but I know I'll be repeating
[1:22] scriptures different quotations and REO
[1:25] going back over several things that
[1:26] we've already looked at but I want to
[1:28] further establish what God God's
[1:30] original way of receiving any Redemptive
[1:33] blessing and receiving Divine Healing
[1:35] the original way and then as my subtitle
[1:38] indicates I want to identify a Tipping
[1:41] Point and and a Tipping Point both in a
[1:43] good way but a bad way there's a point
[1:45] at which maybe and I'm not necessarily
[1:47] using it in this sense but there's a
[1:49] point at which you could come to spot
[1:50] and says well it could go either way and
[1:52] and go either way catastrophically in
[1:54] one way and the best thing ever the
[1:55] other way and we're almost wanting to
[1:57] hone in on this idea that at some point
[2:00] um it can tip both in a good way and a
[2:02] bad way and so there uh as we as we're
[2:06] thinking about these things there's a
[2:07] purpose to Divine Healing we could say
[2:09] well it seems pretty plain to me brother
[2:11] Aon if I'm sick and someone lays hands
[2:13] on me and prays for me I get well that's
[2:15] that's got to be the purpose right so I
[2:16] can go without a headache for a few days
[2:18] or so that I can be delivered from this
[2:19] cold or whatever it might be that's got
[2:21] to be the purpose for it but there's
[2:23] more to Divine Healing than just the
[2:26] actual remedy to what was ailing you
[2:28] even in one place and I know that we've
[2:30] read this before where brother bradam
[2:31] says you want to be healed he says
[2:32] what's the reason you want to be healed
[2:35] for and he's actually to kind of stir up
[2:38] someone's faith and get them to think
[2:39] about well I want to be healed and I'm
[2:41] desperate to be healed but what's your
[2:43] motive and objective what's the purpose
[2:44] and the reason and so there there's
[2:46] enough to it to where God brother Bram
[2:48] is actually identifying there's a
[2:50] promise and there's a need but why
[2:53] because it has to has to meet some
[2:54] purpose we want to be able to place
[2:56] healing within God's plan and this will
[3:00] this kind of just sums it up for me in
[3:01] in a lot of ways at the outset that the
[3:03] purpose of Divine Healing or the purpose
[3:06] of physical healing is to point to the
[3:09] truth and reality of full Redemption
[3:11] that whenever whenever we are healed
[3:13] physically it is a it is another uh
[3:16] Stone to the foundation there's another
[3:18] deposit of the earnest it's another
[3:20] reminder of the truth of full Redemption
[3:23] not that we could live um 180 years and
[3:26] every time we had strep throat get
[3:27] healed immediately and then just die and
[3:29] never to live again but that anytime
[3:32] that we're healed it speaks of a
[3:34] resurrection it speaks of an eternal day
[3:37] and So Divine Healing is a sign that the
[3:39] price has been paid as you turn to
[3:41] Isaiah chapter 53 it's a sign that a
[3:43] price has been paid it's not just for
[3:45] temporary healing but it's a it
[3:47] indicates permanent Redemption because
[3:50] we recognize that um we can get sick and
[3:53] be healed only to get sick again I don't
[3:55] want anybody here to have a negative
[3:57] testimony but anyone ever been healed
[3:59] amen and how many have been sick again
[4:02] just as many hands would go up and say
[4:03] yep maybe something else but we get sick
[4:06] again it's just the nature of life but
[4:08] in Isaiah chapter maybe not a but there
[4:10] but and in Isaiah chapter 53:5 it says
[4:13] but he was wounded for our
[4:15] transgressions he was bruised for our
[4:17] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[4:20] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[4:24] healed to us this scripture does not
[4:27] resonate in an unfamiliar way we don't
[4:29] read it Like H what does this even mean
[4:31] but truly to a Jew at the time that this
[4:33] prophecy is uttered um there would be
[4:36] elements that they would hearken back to
[4:38] the the symbolisms of the sacrifice
[4:40] there'd be certain things about the
[4:41] language that's being used where they
[4:43] would understand atonement and sacrifice
[4:45] and the shedding of blood but yet it's
[4:48] pointing to one who would actually be a
[4:51] savior and that in his wounding it would
[4:53] remedy transgressions in his bruising it
[4:56] would take care of iniquities that in
[4:58] his chastising it would be for our peace
[5:01] and our Accord and for the satisfaction
[5:02] of God's Wrath and that with his stripes
[5:05] him being beaten him being striped that
[5:07] we would be healed he says we are healed
[5:10] by his stripes so now looking back the
[5:12] scripture doesn't seem to be very alien
[5:14] to us because we recognize this in Jesus
[5:16] Christ and then to us we could say it's
[5:18] already an absolute promise it's already
[5:20] settled by the work of Calvary we are
[5:23] healed amen and as we've ID as we kind
[5:27] of Taken time just to make reference to
[5:30] this when he shed his blood it was for
[5:32] the Redemption of the soul but that
[5:34] price was so great it included the
[5:35] healing of your body and so the price of
[5:38] redemption paid for our healing and the
[5:40] atonement for sin is the same it
[5:44] includes physical healing brother Braham
[5:47] said take Divine Healing away from
[5:48] Christ you cut half the atonement into
[5:50] two so think of that if you were to if
[5:53] you were to take the message of the hour
[5:55] take the Bible and preach against Divine
[5:57] Healing you're cutting Christ in two any
[5:59] way try to skew it to say that there's
[6:01] no there's no uh uh power of God to heal
[6:04] there's no power of God to raise up and
[6:05] you try to take these things out of the
[6:07] word of God you're actually diminishing
[6:08] the power of the atonement and remember
[6:11] that there's a point at which you can
[6:12] diminish the power of the atonement
[6:15] remember I makes some Curious statements
[6:16] in this regard but I'll just make
[6:18] reference to a couple of he says now
[6:19] some of the Full Gospel people turned
[6:21] firmly against Divine Healing believe
[6:24] that it wasn't even in the
[6:26] atonement I know that doesn't seem quite
[6:29] right to us maybe we don't come into
[6:31] contact with a lot of people who believe
[6:32] the word of God who would be against
[6:34] Divine Healing be saying Full Gospel
[6:36] people have turned against Divine
[6:38] Healing and found a way to to wiggle it
[6:41] out of the atonement found a way to say
[6:43] ah well it's not in the atonement that's
[6:45] where you hear of the dispensationalist
[6:46] who say the days of Miracles are passed
[6:48] or that was only for the apostles
[6:50] there's a lot of very very rich Theology
[6:53] and academic study and and a lot of
[6:55] commentaries to establish that there
[6:57] were certain things given to the
[6:59] apostles
[7:00] in the days of after the days of Christ
[7:02] and the setting up of the church and
[7:03] that they did these things alone and no
[7:05] one else is to do them and there's this
[7:07] idea that exist when it comes to these
[7:10] things specifically with reference to
[7:12] Divine Healing brother bam said the
[7:13] devil fights this wonderful truth of
[7:15] Divine Healing and marks it
[7:19] up and so because the devil fights
[7:21] against it and marks it up that's the
[7:23] reason why it's good for us to take time
[7:24] to look at the promise of God because
[7:26] the devil is always fighting the
[7:28] wonderful truth of it in trying to mark
[7:30] it
[7:31] up we've read a lot from Psalms 107:20
[7:34] want this to be kind of a Cornerstone to
[7:36] us he sent his word and healed them and
[7:39] de delivered them from their
[7:41] destructions how did he heal them by
[7:43] sending his word God's word is so
[7:46] powerful he sent his command at his
[7:48] command the broken are mended at his
[7:50] command the sick are made well it's
[7:52] exactly what the scripture saying he
[7:54] sent his word and the word being sent by
[7:57] his command something that's broken is
[7:59] fixed something that sick has made well
[8:02] and in the ministry of Jesus Christ the
[8:04] power of God or the power of the word
[8:06] was demonstrated quite frequently in
[8:08] Matthew chap 8: 16 and 17 when the even
[8:12] was come they brought unto him many that
[8:14] were possessed with devils and he cast
[8:16] out the spirits with his word and healed
[8:19] all that were
[8:21] sick that it might be fulfilled which
[8:23] was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[8:25] himself took our infirmities and bear
[8:27] our sicknesses so here's the Fulfillment
[8:30] in the writing in the inspirational
[8:31] writing of the works of Jesus Christ
[8:33] that he cast out Spirits with his word
[8:37] and by his word he healed the sick this
[8:39] is this is even the prophecy of Psalms
[8:42] 107:20 he sent his word and healed them
[8:45] so now he's speaking the word and he's
[8:47] casting out Spirits by his word the
[8:49] sicker healed by his word and it
[8:51] fulfills he took on our infirmities and
[8:53] he bore our sicknesses Luke Chapter 5
[8:56] verse1 15 and but so much the more went
[8:58] there Fame abroad of him in great
[9:01] multitudes came together to hear and to
[9:04] be healed by him of their infirmities
[9:07] the healing came by the hearing they
[9:08] hearing and they're healed by their
[9:11] infirmities Luke 7: 211 and in the same
[9:14] hour he cured many of their infirmities
[9:16] and plagues and of evil spirits and unto
[9:19] many that were blind he gave sight this
[9:22] is uh just a a sample of the many
[9:25] different instances in scripture where
[9:27] the sick were healed and we find where
[9:29] the blind can see and the lame walk and
[9:31] the dead are raised these are uh these
[9:33] are uh examples of the word healing the
[9:38] word delivering from
[9:40] destructions so it's no surprise in Mark
[9:42] chapter 16 that Jesus is going to give a
[9:45] Great Commission and he's going to tell
[9:48] them to preach the gospel and then
[9:50] there's going to be certain signs
[9:51] following because it's the very same
[9:52] things that were in Jesus Christ
[9:54] Ministry in verse 14 this is the preface
[9:58] to it to me is so important
[10:00] afterward he appeared under the 11 as
[10:01] they sat at meat and up braided them
[10:04] with their unbelief and Hardness of
[10:06] Heart so here's the you know the 11 of
[10:09] the 12 disciples Judas having uh gone
[10:12] off the scene and he's upbraiding them
[10:17] with their unbelief in other words he's
[10:18] using their unbelief to say look I can't
[10:20] believe you didn't believe and oh you
[10:21] have little faith and the hardness of
[10:23] heart well where where was their
[10:24] unbelief and how was their heart hard
[10:26] because they believed not them which had
[10:28] seen him after he was
[10:30] risen this is important to catch it it's
[10:34] and I think we mentioned this before
[10:35] it's not that their testimony or their
[10:37] witness should have been foreign to them
[10:39] because there was already a promise that
[10:40] it would happen right and so if they
[10:43] would come saying that we uh we we found
[10:46] Jesus uh riding a Tesla plaid it's you
[10:49] know candy red and and you should come
[10:51] see him they like that doesn't even make
[10:53] what is that we don't even know what
[10:54] that is what are you talking about but
[10:55] they said he's risen on the third day
[10:58] the tomb is empty and they ought to have
[11:00] remembered well that's exactly what his
[11:01] word said and they they should have
[11:03] believed him on the report of the
[11:05] disciples and so he is disappointed of
[11:08] their unbelief and their Hardness of
[11:10] Heart that they didn't believe the
[11:12] witness of those who had seen him and
[11:15] then immediately he says and he said
[11:17] unto them go into all the world and do
[11:19] the same thing that you didn't believe
[11:21] go go into all the world tell everybody
[11:23] I'm resurrected and I want them to
[11:25] believe like you didn't believe when you
[11:26] were told
[11:29] That's Unique isn't it you didn't
[11:31] believe me when they told you I was
[11:32] risen but I want you to go into all the
[11:34] world and preach the resurrected Jesus
[11:36] Christ and if they don't believe you
[11:38] they're
[11:39] damned no wonder he ided them for their
[11:41] unbelief and Hardness of Heart he said
[11:44] unto them go ye into all the world and
[11:45] preach the gospel to Every Creature so
[11:47] it's the preaching of the gospel and he
[11:49] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[11:51] saved but he that believeth not shall be
[11:53] damned so what's the most critical thing
[11:55] we recognize in this scripture faith
[11:58] faith is the most critical thing because
[12:00] without faith you're damned without
[12:01] faith you cannot please God go into all
[12:03] the world and preach the gospel what is
[12:05] the the desired result of preaching the
[12:07] gospel that people would believe and in
[12:10] believing they would be baptized that
[12:12] that's it preach the gospel that people
[12:14] would believe and that's the believe and
[12:16] be baptized and they are saved I kind of
[12:19] you say that just sums it up that's the
[12:20] Great Commission and that's what God
[12:23] desires us to do God desires that we
[12:25] would take him at his word that's why I
[12:27] think even the the leadup to this is he
[12:29] up braided them with their unbelief and
[12:30] their Hardness of Heart because they
[12:32] believed not them which had seen him
[12:34] after he was risen that God wants us to
[12:36] believe upon the report or testimony of
[12:39] his
[12:40] word believe it according to his promise
[12:43] it says in John chapter 6 verses 28 and
[12:46] 29 then they said unto him what shall we
[12:48] do that we might work the works of God
[12:50] people want to always do something
[12:52] outstanding and he says what shall we do
[12:55] that we might work he says in verse 29
[12:57] Jesus answered and said to them this is
[12:59] the work of God that you believe on him
[13:01] whom he hath
[13:02] sent and I could put it this way faith
[13:05] is the chief result amen it's the chief
[13:08] work of God I that when when when God is
[13:13] in it faith is the product of it that's
[13:16] the work of God that you believe that
[13:18] that someone would Testify the word of
[13:19] God someone would preach the word of God
[13:21] and the work of God is that you
[13:24] believe you catch that because there's a
[13:27] way that we just diminish it so much to
[13:29] where like no no no no no no no no the
[13:30] work of God would all of a sudden for
[13:32] him to appear in a holographic form
[13:34] right now but no the work of God is that
[13:36] you
[13:37] believe this is the work of God that you
[13:39] believe and we know that that faith that
[13:41] belief comes by the word so it's the
[13:43] word that God uses to instigate belief
[13:45] and that's his that's the conviction
[13:48] it's actually said uh of the in the Old
[13:51] Testament I think they've uh narrowed
[13:53] the law down to 613 different precepts a
[13:57] and they and the Jews actually taken
[13:59] habac and they say that all 613 are
[14:01] summed up in this one precept the just
[14:03] shall live by his faith 613 laws and
[14:07] Commandments and and to them to the Jews
[14:10] that would think all of these are
[14:11] precious they would say that life is
[14:13] bound up in this one phrase the just
[14:15] shall live by his
[14:18] faith and so this is a statement we've
[14:20] been reading quite a bit and what it
[14:21] takes to overcome all unbelief our faith
[14:24] he says now the initial and original way
[14:26] to receive any Redemptive blessing is
[14:28] hearing the word of God because Faith
[14:32] cometh by hearing hearing the word of
[14:33] God like the ministers preach we're not
[14:36] using wanting to use philosophy or logic
[14:40] just for this to make sense but if you
[14:42] were sick and never knew you could be
[14:44] healed chances are there's not going to
[14:47] be uh there's not going to be maybe some
[14:49] osmosis where I'm just going to look at
[14:51] you and kind of Nod knowingly and you're
[14:53] like what are you what are you staring
[14:54] at me for you're making me feel weird
[14:56] like you would you learn about the power
[14:59] Divine Healing primarily you learn about
[15:01] the power of God to heal by someone
[15:03] telling you he can this is the this is
[15:06] the order of scripture and he says faith
[15:09] cometh by hearing he says like the
[15:10] ministers preach and that's the original
[15:13] way the word preached brings forth faith
[15:16] provokes faith and that's what brings
[15:18] any Redemptive blessing and I I love how
[15:21] he goes takes this step further if that
[15:22] were you and I that would be sufficient
[15:24] and you and I said that's right if you
[15:27] don't believe me fine
[15:30] if the people didn't want to believe us
[15:31] why just let them go on but God is so
[15:35] good so remarkable the nature and
[15:37] character of God we think God's just
[15:39] dogmatic he sent his word and healed
[15:40] them that's it if they don't want to
[15:41] believe it the work of God is to believe
[15:43] so if they don't believe then they've
[15:44] Deni the word of God but God is so good
[15:47] and so full of Mercy till after that he
[15:50] sent his word then he sent gifts into
[15:53] the
[15:53] church and so the gifts in the church
[15:57] are to help us to what what come to a
[16:00] place of believing it's God's way of
[16:01] getting us to accept him and receive him
[16:04] and have our faith placed in him so God
[16:07] is so good that he sent gifts into his
[16:09] church so now back into the the the
[16:11] Great Commission go ye into all the
[16:13] world and preach the gospel to Every
[16:14] Creature he that believeth on uh
[16:16] believeth in his baptized shall be saved
[16:18] but he that believeth not shall be
[16:19] damned and so he sends his
[16:22] word and we would say that should be
[16:25] sufficient but God is so good till he
[16:27] sends gifts into his church Church to
[16:29] follow the word so in verse 17 and these
[16:32] signs shall follow them that believe so
[16:35] notice the order they that believe or
[16:38] preaching the gospel signs are following
[16:40] in my name shall they cast out Devils
[16:43] they shall speak with new tongues they
[16:45] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[16:47] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[16:49] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[16:52] they shall recover this is part of the
[16:54] Great Commission this is part of God
[16:57] sending gifts following the word word in
[16:59] order to build our faith or to provoke
[17:02] faith in
[17:03] him these signs shall follow them that
[17:06] believe we recognize the order that
[17:09] we're not following after signs but
[17:11] signs are following the
[17:13] believer in the sermon Jehovah gy says
[17:16] so your gift and he's referring to
[17:17] ministers that he' asked to come onto
[17:19] the platform and pray and form a prayer
[17:20] line he says and and he's talking about
[17:22] you could take the word and teach these
[17:24] things he says so your gift is to do
[17:26] that and that's the original way believe
[17:28] his word
[17:29] he sent his word and healed them that's
[17:33] the way it's supposed to
[17:35] be I'm just making reference to these
[17:38] these statements a and and just for full
[17:41] disclosure it's not like brother
[17:42] brandham said it 1181 times where every
[17:45] time he just kind of makes reference to
[17:47] this but there's there's a frequency to
[17:49] it and there's an emphasis in these
[17:51] different places where he's just wanting
[17:52] us to recognize that the word is what
[17:55] does it that's the way it's supposed to
[17:57] be but then God God is so good and makes
[18:00] such promises because that's the
[18:02] original way take them at his word but
[18:05] it's still in the nature of God it's not
[18:08] that the God God hasn't said well just
[18:10] take me at my word if you won't believe
[18:11] me I'm just going to subcontract this
[18:13] out to the devil and let him do the
[18:15] signs and wonders that that's what it
[18:17] takes to get you to believe it's not
[18:18] that God is varying from his nature or
[18:21] or doing something wrong but he says if
[18:24] he so good and make such promises if
[18:26] they can't believe the word
[18:29] then he shows them a sign that it's him
[18:31] there that is what it's for God is so
[18:35] good that when we don't have the faith
[18:37] to believe that it's him he does
[18:40] something for us isn't that wonderful to
[18:43] know that God will do it that it if that
[18:47] in that we're we're not certain and and
[18:49] we're not sure and I think it's even in
[18:51] the resurrection of Lazarus he says that
[18:53] that the others might believe and and
[18:55] that that they might recognize and hear
[18:56] he begins to he begins to pray and
[18:58] there's certain things that that God
[19:00] will do because he recognizes Lord I
[19:03] believe help thou my unbelief and so he
[19:06] does something to draw you into
[19:08] confidence to draw you into trust I was
[19:11] taking time this past week to go over I
[19:13] I kind of I have a list of 37 different
[19:15] Miracles that Jesus had performed and
[19:19] the the different mechanics to each time
[19:22] someone was healed and how in one
[19:24] instance he just tells a leopard go wash
[19:26] and be healed but then in another
[19:29] instance he actually lays his hands on
[19:31] him and he prays for him and and when
[19:34] you recognize that you realize that for
[19:36] the one the word was enough right but
[19:39] for the other there may have been some
[19:41] stigma there may have been some scar
[19:42] there may have been some ostracization
[19:44] there might have been some lack of
[19:46] confidence does he view me like
[19:47] everybody else am I just an outcast am I
[19:49] a Scourge on society so he takes him and
[19:52] he touches him and removes all the
[19:54] complexes removes all the fear removes
[19:56] the stigma and that becomes the very
[19:59] thing that opens up the fow ground of
[20:01] the heart to receive his healing because
[20:03] God is so good he'll meet us where we
[20:06] are not to keep us there but to take us
[20:10] deeper into trust with
[20:12] him they can't believe the word he shows
[20:15] them a sign that it's him here him there
[20:18] that's what it's for and so as we would
[20:20] see Jesus he says Divine Healing is not
[20:22] done by a man the Divine Healing is a
[20:24] finished product the only thing a
[20:26] minister can do is preach the word
[20:30] a a a minister cannot heal you no
[20:32] surprise there we have just within the
[20:35] body of Christ I can say this on any
[20:37] level whether it be uh evangelists
[20:40] teachers pastors the gifts that are
[20:43] operating in the bride of Christ these
[20:44] days are just beyond uh description
[20:47] beautiful gifts of God rightly dividing
[20:50] the word of Truth signs and wonders
[20:52] following powerful meetings uh the word
[20:55] of God just being laid out word by word
[20:57] by word All Around The World God is God
[20:59] has God ordained uh men who are lifting
[21:01] up the uh the word of Jesus Christ
[21:03] ministering to the bride of Christ but
[21:05] none of them can heal
[21:07] you am all they can do is preach the
[21:10] word he says that ought to be sufficient
[21:13] that ought to settle it now why why
[21:16] would he make these statements not to
[21:19] create a
[21:21] stigma on anything else not to create a
[21:25] resistance or reluctance to anything
[21:26] else but that we might recognize the
[21:29] order because we could look at it it
[21:31] says well the word is preached but then
[21:33] the gifts happen the signs happen the
[21:35] Wonders happen then that must be what
[21:38] the ultimate is the word comes first and
[21:41] then ultimately we have these
[21:43] manifestations and this power and we
[21:45] like well then that what what it must be
[21:47] for but no the word comes and it ought
[21:50] to be sufficient to produce Faith but in
[21:52] the absence of Faith being instigated by
[21:54] the word god is so gracious to bring
[21:56] signs that it might do what the word
[21:59] originally was supposed to do create
[22:01] trust and confidence in
[22:02] God so word manifestation
[22:07] Faith so you're you're not coming back
[22:09] to the the demonstration or the outward
[22:12] manifestation as the ultimate the
[22:14] ultimate Is What It produced in your
[22:15] heart
[22:17] right now if you
[22:19] could focus very intently with me this
[22:22] is going to be very treacherous what I
[22:24] were trying to do this morning and I I I
[22:26] had the thought when I was coming up to
[22:29] walking out of the church that uh I
[22:31] think God is making me uh pay a little
[22:34] bit for preaching so much about
[22:35] tremendous humidity back East because I
[22:38] have never experienced such humidity
[22:39] here in Arizona and uh Lord forgive me I
[22:42] don't know what I do I'm sorry I take it
[22:45] all back I'll print a retraction in the
[22:47] morning whatever it
[22:48] takes and also Brother Martin Sister Pro
[22:51] it's good to have you back I hope you've
[22:52] recovered from the wedding brother the
[22:54] Martin told me be glad you only have one
[22:56] daughter and three sons and so
[22:59] let me know how the rest of it goes what
[23:00] the secret
[23:01] is it's nice to have them back now it's
[23:05] this I say Focus because balance is so
[23:09] important is there's going to be things
[23:11] I read even things I've already said
[23:13] that in your mind you may have already
[23:15] built up a complex because you've heard
[23:17] it
[23:17] misused taking the word of God turn it
[23:20] into a club to beat people who believe
[23:22] in Divine Healing beat Ministries that
[23:25] have demonstrations in their Ministry
[23:27] gifts oper signs and wonders following
[23:30] uh powerful meetings and and testimonies
[23:33] and healings and and even to some degree
[23:35] prophecies and things and you could take
[23:37] script you could take these very things
[23:39] and try to uh oppose other Ministries
[23:41] and oppose other men and so then I might
[23:43] read something and you might have a
[23:45] little bit of a complex built up against
[23:46] it but I say don't don't put it in my
[23:49] don't put paint me with any particular
[23:51] brush and don't put it in that channel
[23:54] you just trust God today for your own
[23:56] sake to even believe that if I'm up here
[23:59] with a certain bent and a certain motive
[24:00] and objective and I've got an ax to
[24:03] grind that God will just take it from my
[24:05] be once it leaves my mouth he'll take it
[24:07] and rightly divide it to your heart so
[24:09] that you can place the word properly but
[24:11] Focus very intently because the balance
[24:13] is so
[24:14] important it's an extremely important
[24:17] balance but when brother says the only
[24:18] thing a minister can do is preach that
[24:19] ought to be sufficient that ought to
[24:20] settle it is because that's the original
[24:23] way is to believe his word when he sends
[24:25] it that's the Supreme way so the Supreme
[24:28] way and the best way would be word
[24:30] only and all the parents
[24:33] said amen like that's it I shouldn't try
[24:37] and entice my kid to do something by
[24:40] giving them
[24:42] gifts I shouldn't have to try to uh you
[24:45] know Co coer compliance uh by promising
[24:48] them all sorts of uh you know binge of
[24:51] movies or something no it's say I ask
[24:53] you to do it you ought to do
[24:55] it so it shouldn't be hard it shouldn't
[24:57] be too far for us to understand that
[24:59] that is the the Supreme way the word
[25:01] only and so the purpose of the gifts the
[25:04] purpose of signs and wonders is so that
[25:06] the word can rise to
[25:10] preeminence that that's the reason even
[25:12] as we I think it was this past Wednesday
[25:14] that we were speaking on one of the uh
[25:17] on the subject of the seven bad habits
[25:19] of highly ineffective parents and how
[25:22] the purpose of discipline and the
[25:23] purpose of using our voice and how it's
[25:25] all working together to cultivate the
[25:27] child's character not just a mechanism
[25:29] to vent frustration or a mechanism to
[25:31] deal with a a a temporary uh behavioral
[25:35] issue right is to is to produce long
[25:38] long-term character and and ways of
[25:41] assessing right and wrong and ways of
[25:43] making the right decision and that's
[25:45] what God wants to do with signs and
[25:47] wonders is he wants us to come to a
[25:49] place to where the word has
[25:53] preeminence now I I want to express it
[25:55] this way you're going to be turning to
[25:57] James chapter 5
[25:59] I want to express it this way maybe kind
[26:01] of as a paradigm
[26:02] shift and as I think about it it might
[26:05] not make much sense but the original way
[26:09] is not just the point of origin but it's
[26:12] the ultimate
[26:14] Destiny does that make sense okay good
[26:17] I'll just look at you while I'm talking
[26:18] about
[26:19] this because we think about the original
[26:21] way the original the original original
[26:24] and so there's a point at which we say
[26:27] well that was the original
[26:29] and then we we start from there that's
[26:31] the way it begins well how does it end
[26:33] and where do we go from there but in
[26:35] this sense I'm wanted to kind of shift
[26:36] our Paradigm towards like well the word
[26:38] only but yeah you got the word but then
[26:40] now we've got this but brother bandam
[26:42] takes it in the indictment says from
[26:43] then on comes the word and the word only
[26:46] so in the end it's the ultimate so you
[26:48] have an original way and then we we can
[26:51] say well that's the way it starts but
[26:53] how does it end well that's the way we
[26:54] end the word is the ultimate destiny we
[26:58] could say well and maybe I'm I might be
[27:00] getting a little bit away from myself
[27:01] here there's that age-old question do we
[27:03] go back to Pentecost or do we go beyond
[27:06] Pentecost right maybe that's what we
[27:09] wait and debate here after service is
[27:11] back to or Beyond but let me just put
[27:12] there you better have been
[27:16] there you you better have been there or
[27:19] you'll never be there right in James
[27:22] chapter 5:
[27:24] 14-15 he says is any sick among
[27:27] you let him call for the Elders of the
[27:29] church and let them pray over him
[27:31] anointing him with oil in the name of
[27:32] the Lord and the prayer of faith shall
[27:35] save the sick and the Lord shall raise
[27:37] him
[27:39] up if I if I'm able to maybe next
[27:42] Sunday I like to come back to this
[27:45] Dynamic of laying hands some of the
[27:47] where where these things are coming
[27:49] from but to me it's just so plain and it
[27:53] fits with Mark chapter 16 they shall lay
[27:55] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[27:57] so if there's anybody sick call the
[28:00] Elders let them anoint them with oil
[28:02] praying over him and the prayer of faith
[28:04] shall save the sick and the Lord will
[28:06] deliver them heal
[28:07] them this is part of the establishment
[28:10] of the Christian church this is part of
[28:11] our foundation and the doctrine of the
[28:13] Apostles it's a necessary foundational
[28:16] principle of Faith this is part of the
[28:19] word amen absolutely part of the word
[28:23] now and I think this is where we kind of
[28:25] touched on a little bit last time and
[28:27] we're going to use a a little bit
[28:28] different maybe some different
[28:29] statements to emphasize this again but
[28:31] there Comes a Day
[28:32] July that you have someone who's sick
[28:35] and they call elders and they anoint
[28:38] with oil and they're going to lay hands
[28:40] on them they're they're going to say
[28:41] pray the prayer of faith and there's all
[28:43] sorts of elements where we say well
[28:46] Elders
[28:48] oil right there's all these other things
[28:50] that begin to enter into the picture
[28:51] that if we're not careful the people can
[28:54] make an idol out of the hands an idol
[28:57] out of the out of out of the anointing
[29:00] out of the oil an idol out of the Dynam
[29:02] the mechanics of it and and brother
[29:05] brandom even mentions it I think we this
[29:06] is where we read the statements a couple
[29:08] weeks ago where he says look what's
[29:09] happened with the little Ministry God's
[29:11] given me how much confusion it's caused
[29:13] because the way in which it was operated
[29:15] everyone wanted to kind of mimic the
[29:17] mechanics right and reproduce the same
[29:21] thing and so I want to put it this way
[29:25] and when I say when I say a danger a
[29:27] danger Li
[29:29] I when in going down this path and this
[29:32] kind of if this kind of gets you excited
[29:33] you all want to kind of grab your
[29:34] buckets of popcorn say well let's see
[29:36] what happens to brother Aaron when he
[29:37] goes down this path uh it's very easy to
[29:40] be
[29:41] misunderstood very easy to be
[29:43] misunderstood and and and you could be
[29:45] very you can be criticized easily
[29:46] criticized because you make certain
[29:48] statements and it's very easy to say
[29:49] well just put them in this bucket there
[29:50] are uh no Divine Healing uh days of
[29:53] Miracles are passed they're just a Ted
[29:55] talker right there's going to put you in
[29:57] a particular category and so I'll I'll
[30:00] run the risk so that you can be
[30:03] free and I'll take the criticism so that
[30:06] your faith can operate where God wants
[30:08] it to operate but there's a Tipping
[30:11] Point there's a Tipping Point where the
[30:13] very things that God has used in order
[30:15] to establish faith and to build our
[30:18] faith that it starts working
[30:19] counterproductive to
[30:21] Faith brother BR even I meant to look
[30:23] this up before service he makes a
[30:25] statement that in the Great commission
[30:28] he said go into all the world baptizing
[30:30] them in the father and of the son and of
[30:31] the Holy Ghost it's in the word but he
[30:33] says they used it as a ladder to walk
[30:34] right out of the word to even say that
[30:36] demons travel in that
[30:39] appalation but wait a minute hold on
[30:42] it's in the word the misuse of it
[30:45] changes its utility right I think it was
[30:48] on Wednesday night we talked about you
[30:49] can't take the word of God says says
[30:51] beat them beat them and it won't kill
[30:53] him beat them and drive that Spirit from
[30:56] all right well the Bible says beat him
[30:57] so I'm going to beat you can't take the
[30:59] nature of the word and the character of
[31:00] the word out of the word and use the
[31:01] word and expect to get the word results
[31:04] it's going to be something totally
[31:05] different
[31:06] altogether and so there's a Tipping
[31:08] Point now in 1 Corinthians chapter 1: 12
[31:11] to1 18 and I I have to go I I need to
[31:14] speed up a little bit here now this I
[31:16] say that every one of you saith I am a
[31:19] Paul and I have Apollos and I I have
[31:21] sephus and I have Christ is Christ
[31:24] divided was Paul crucified for you or
[31:27] were you baptized in the name of Paul I
[31:30] thank God that I baptized none of you
[31:33] now that statement is kind of like whoa
[31:35] wait a minute
[31:36] what isn't the Great Commission you know
[31:39] some Apostle you are bud but he says I
[31:42] thank God I baptized none of you and
[31:45] meanwhile there's guys over there you
[31:46] know like with their books saying look
[31:48] how many I
[31:49] baptized and all a sudden Paul says I'm
[31:51] glad I didn't baptize any of they're
[31:52] like oh well you know and they start
[31:54] comparing their journals he says but
[31:57] Chris and GA so at least he baptized
[31:59] somebody and then he says lest any
[32:01] should say that I had baptized my own
[32:03] name what is Paul identifying this part
[32:06] of human nature that fixates on the
[32:09] tangible on the person on the minister
[32:14] right on on the anecdotal evidence of
[32:17] things and like they're going to find a
[32:18] feather build a chicken right and so
[32:22] he's he's aware of this and he says and
[32:24] I baptized also the household of
[32:26] stephanus so he realized no not just
[32:27] Chris and gas but also the household of
[32:29] stephanus and we're all kind of happy to
[32:31] know that at least he did baptize maybe
[32:33] not as many as others but at least he
[32:35] did baptize what is Paul identifying
[32:37] this kind of this tendency maybe for
[32:40] some people to
[32:41] scoreboard well how many miracles have
[32:43] you
[32:44] had how many people did you lay hands on
[32:48] right that's why we like these cordless
[32:50] mics we can bless God's people with two
[32:55] hands he says
[32:58] I besides besides that I know not
[33:01] whether I baptized any other so I mean
[33:03] you could say Crispus gas and I don't
[33:05] know how big the household of stephanus
[33:06] was but I'm sure it wasn't a thousand
[33:09] right so Paul is uh Paul is you know
[33:13] just not very
[33:15] many verse 17 for Christ sent me not to
[33:19] baptize hold on wait a minute so he's
[33:22] not commissioned does he not fit in Mark
[33:24] 16 I'm confused here he says I was not
[33:27] sent God did not send me to baptize but
[33:29] to preach the gospel I know it might
[33:31] seem and maybe just the way I'm
[33:33] presenting it kind of makes it seem to
[33:34] be a little bit of a bigger hard stop
[33:36] than it ought to be he says I wasn't
[33:38] sent to baptize but to preach the
[33:41] gospel but what's the outcome of
[33:42] preaching the gospel people would be
[33:44] baptized so the ultimate's not the
[33:46] baptism otherwise if we wanted baptisms
[33:49] I'm pretty sure we could have a session
[33:51] next Sunday and we could just train you
[33:53] to go out as door to-door salesman and
[33:56] and we could be busy
[33:58] right in that little tank out there just
[34:01] baptizing them right give a little
[34:03] commemorative towel with our church
[34:05] website on it but that's not the goal
[34:08] the goal is to preach the word to preach
[34:10] the
[34:11] gospel and he says Christ sent me not to
[34:14] baptize but to preach the gospel not
[34:15] with wisdom of words lest the Christ
[34:18] lest the Cross of Christ should be made
[34:20] of none
[34:22] effect for the preaching of the Cross is
[34:25] to them that perish foolishness but us
[34:28] which are saved it is the power of God
[34:32] where where where's the stigma on the
[34:35] preaching says the preaching to them
[34:38] that perish is foolishness it's a way
[34:39] that is called
[34:41] heresy you're traveling down this road
[34:43] and everyone's like you're a fool you're
[34:45] a fool but trust me one day they'll see
[34:47] that it was
[34:48] wise one day this way is going to be
[34:51] proven to be the Wise Way stick with it
[34:54] stay with it he says the Cross of Christ
[34:55] should be made not effect if I just come
[34:57] with the wisdom of words he says but the
[34:59] preaching of the Cross to them that
[35:00] perish is foolishness but to us it is
[35:02] the power of God preaching the word is
[35:05] the power of God and I think this is
[35:07] where Paul is identifying this hidden
[35:10] trap where he says I'm of Paul I'm of
[35:12] Apollos I'm of
[35:13] sephus and he there's a there's a way
[35:16] that in the preaching of the Gospel if
[35:19] something begins to get have a little
[35:21] bit of the preeminence or emphasis we
[35:24] can establish our faith on the basis of
[35:27] Trad
[35:28] ition or the basis of the works and not
[35:31] the promise in the
[35:32] word because he says that Christ sent me
[35:35] not to baptize but to preach the gospel
[35:37] and could we not say that according to
[35:39] the commission that the desired result
[35:42] of preaching the gospel is that people
[35:43] would believe and be baptized so Paul is
[35:46] realizing that if I could just keep the
[35:49] main thing the main thing right if I
[35:52] could just keep the first thing first
[35:53] and Minister the gospel then the results
[35:56] will follow but if I start to put
[35:58] something forward just a little bit it's
[36:00] going to be human nature to gravitate to
[36:03] that as a comfort as a security blanket
[36:07] why had Paul baptized me who baptized
[36:11] you Jesus makes reference to it in Mark
[36:14] 7:3 making the word of God of none
[36:17] effect through your
[36:18] tradition they were brother R talks
[36:20] about so indoc they were so
[36:22] indoctrinated with the mechanics that
[36:24] they can't can't see the
[36:26] word they can't see the forest for the
[36:28] trees they're so fixated on the
[36:30] specifics they're so fixated on certain
[36:32] particular aspects of it that they don't
[36:34] step back and see how it all speaks of
[36:36] Jesus Christ how it fits into the plan
[36:38] of God and through their tradition they
[36:40] take the word of God and by building a
[36:43] tradition around it what it was supposed
[36:45] to do in the beginning is no longer
[36:47] effective and Paul says I don't want to
[36:49] make the mistake when preaching the
[36:51] gospel to put the emphasis on something
[36:53] else so that the word of God and the
[36:55] preaching of the Cross is made
[36:59] ineffective I don't want it to turn into
[37:01] something to where I put so much
[37:03] emphasis on the baptism they're not even
[37:05] listening to what I said and it's not
[37:07] Faith that's being conjured up by the
[37:09] preaching of the Gospel people are just
[37:10] lining up to be
[37:12] baptized not because I preach the gospel
[37:15] and therefore you say well they were
[37:16] they heard you preach and they were
[37:17] baptized but the gospel wasn't
[37:20] effective there was too much of a robust
[37:23] machine there was things were too much
[37:25] too much tradition and they were just in
[37:27] that old habit and pattern of doing it
[37:29] where no one ever took time to stop and
[37:31] ask themselves what are we doing this
[37:32] for what is this supposed to produce
[37:35] what if we keep doing this what is it
[37:37] supposed to look like in 15
[37:42] years in Hebrews chap
[37:44] 4:2 Jesus said they made the word of God
[37:47] a n effect through tradition in Hebrews
[37:48] 4:2 Paul says For unto us was the Gospel
[37:51] preached as well as unto them but the
[37:53] word preached did not profit them not
[37:56] being mixed with faith in them that
[37:58] heard
[37:59] it they saw
[38:02] Miracles they witnessed the supernatural
[38:05] but brother man says it wasn't mixed
[38:07] with personal
[38:09] faith that that was never added into
[38:12] it that was never the additive there
[38:14] were signs wond wonders and miracles and
[38:17] the Word was preached but the word
[38:19] preached didn't profit them despite all
[38:22] of the
[38:23] signs because at the end of the day
[38:25] there was never their own faith
[38:28] that became the additive their own
[38:30] personal faith was never joined to what
[38:33] the
[38:33] word now if that doesn't if that doesn't
[38:36] create some uh some mind candy to think
[38:39] about for a while and be like so the
[38:42] word preached signs and wonders and my
[38:45] faith my personal individual Faith could
[38:48] be to all these things but never
[38:51] actually mix with the
[38:56] gospel because preaching is the power of
[38:58] God so Paul then directs our Focus back
[39:03] to the
[39:04] word as the Builder of our
[39:08] faith brother man writes this in chapter
[39:10] two of the church age book Paul said
[39:12] that the word came in power as well as
[39:14] voice the word preached actually
[39:17] demonstrated
[39:19] itself like a flaming cutting sword it
[39:21] went to the consciences of men and like
[39:24] a surgeon's knife it cut out the
[39:26] diseases and set the captiv free
[39:29] recognize purely the way he just
[39:32] described it preach the word and it
[39:35] leaves like a missile it leaves a a as a
[39:39] a a a sword of God a flaming sword
[39:42] that's going to cut to the conscience so
[39:44] the preaching of the word this is what's
[39:45] happening the word's being preached but
[39:46] it's impacting the individual and it's
[39:49] cutting out diseases and setting the
[39:50] captiv free so it's not just the word
[39:53] preaching and it rattling around in your
[39:55] head I I I like that we can emphasize
[39:58] this because there's a way that you can
[40:01] try to take the word of God to say that
[40:03] you're just going to preach the word and
[40:05] nothing ever changes and just leave and
[40:07] convince yourself that the word is
[40:11] powerful that's that's not that's not
[40:14] what we're
[40:15] selling if that's what you want there's
[40:17] a lot of other places to go if you just
[40:20] want to sit there and just pretend that
[40:23] things are
[40:24] changing but he says the gospel
[40:26] demonstrated itself everywhere those
[40:28] early Believers went they went preaching
[40:29] the gospel word and confirmed that word
[40:31] with signs following the sick were
[40:33] healed Devils were cast out they spoke
[40:35] in new tongues that was the word in
[40:38] action that word has never failed in the
[40:41] mouths of believing Christians and in
[40:43] this last agage it is here stronger and
[40:45] greater than ever in the true word bride
[40:47] oh little flock you little minority hold
[40:50] on to the word fill your mouth and heart
[40:52] with it and someday God will give you
[40:53] the kingdom with the word fill your
[40:56] heart and mouth with the word let that
[40:58] word be added to your faith let it add
[41:00] let it add let it add let it boil up let
[41:02] it be on your lips speak it because that
[41:04] word has never failed in the mouths of
[41:05] believing Christians so the word spoken
[41:09] can demonstrate itself the word can cut
[41:12] like a knife and set the captiv
[41:15] free so Paul is Paul is bringing it back
[41:19] to that it's not just try to conjure up
[41:22] by slide of hand or by Optics or by
[41:25] smoking mirrors or just by you know some
[41:27] pure effort inspiration convince people
[41:30] to be healed but preach the word put
[41:32] your confidence in the word build
[41:34] confidence in the
[41:36] word 1 Corinthians chapter 2: 4 to 5 so
[41:39] this is just right in the next chapter
[41:41] and my speech and my preaching was not
[41:43] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[41:46] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[41:49] power oh there's just so much we could
[41:52] say about the demonstration of the word
[41:55] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[41:57] it's not just in enticing words but the
[41:59] word came with demonstration it came
[42:02] with power however you want to describe
[42:04] it it came with demonstration it came
[42:07] with
[42:08] power why that your faith should not
[42:12] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[42:14] power of
[42:15] God do not forget the desired outcome of
[42:19] the
[42:21] demonstration he preaches the word but
[42:23] not just with things that kind of tickle
[42:25] the ears and entice the mind and engage
[42:27] our thoughts because then that would
[42:29] just be man's Wisdom but he preached the
[42:31] word in demonstration of the spirit and
[42:34] power there were signs followings there
[42:36] was something demonstrated and
[42:38] manifested once the word was preached
[42:40] not that you would put your confidence
[42:42] in Paul not that you would put your
[42:43] confidence in the demonstration not that
[42:45] you would just lust for signs and
[42:47] wonders but that your faith would stand
[42:50] in the power of God what is the power of
[42:53] God it is the gospel
[42:57] amen do not forget this outcome that
[43:00] Paul desired when he said these the the
[43:02] demonstration was there so that we'd
[43:04] have faith in
[43:07] God that's what Paul I believe tells the
[43:09] Corinthians let us go on into Perfection
[43:12] not laying again the foundation of what
[43:13] laying on of hands and you listen to the
[43:16] Hebrew series and brother Brandon makes
[43:17] some very strong statements in this
[43:19] regard very strong statements one that
[43:22] even to this day I you for myself
[43:24] personally I'm wanting just to see how
[43:26] these things can just click
[43:29] together in that particular series some
[43:31] of the ways he places the scripture it's
[43:33] just absolutely
[43:35] amazing and so in Hebrews chap 12:2 he
[43:38] says looking unto Jesus the author
[43:40] looking un Christ the word Jesus Christ
[43:44] the same yesterday today and forever the
[43:46] author or the originator the beginner
[43:48] and the finisher or the perfector of our
[43:52] faith faith has a beginning and faith
[43:55] has a a perfection
[43:57] not that it has an end but it has a a
[43:59] somewhere
[44:01] complete brother brandham in the sermon
[44:03] what are Visions for or what our
[44:07] Visions he's talking about kind of
[44:09] Americans are just kind of they always
[44:10] want you kind of touch I don't know what
[44:12] it is with Americans they're want they
[44:14] want to touch they want laying on of
[44:15] hands he says but we want the greater
[44:17] faith we want to run a higher level the
[44:21] Lord Jesus wants us to believe
[44:24] him so this is this is where again this
[44:27] is where it could get like it's a
[44:29] competition well I've got 77 points of
[44:31] Faith how many do you have 31 well too
[44:34] bad it's not 33 that would be better
[44:37] right and and we kind of keep the
[44:38] scorecard it's not that he's just saying
[44:40] we want the greater faith we want to run
[44:42] at a higher level so we want Faith
[44:46] that's what we want but the potential
[44:48] that faith is really
[44:50] untapped I was going to get into it
[44:52] today and I realized there was I had
[44:53] such tremendous wisdom just to take a
[44:55] whole section of notes out because I
[44:56] don't know if I'll get to the the ones I
[44:57] have here but brother random when he
[44:59] begins perfect Faith he makes some
[45:00] statements now what happens at the end
[45:02] of perfect Faith he has a prayer line
[45:04] and he says I did this for a purpose go
[45:05] back to the beginning he says if you had
[45:07] perfect Faith you wouldn't be standing
[45:08] in a prayer
[45:10] line but that's the way that he
[45:12] describes it if you had perfect Faith
[45:14] you wouldn't be standing here so he
[45:16] preaches on perfect Faith then has a
[45:17] prayer
[45:19] line it's talk about that at
[45:22] lunch because Faith grows there's
[45:25] measures of Faith amen brother BR says
[45:27] your faith is not what you feel your
[45:28] faith is what you
[45:32] believe 1 Thessalonians 3:10 just to
[45:35] kind of capture the thought of Faith
[45:36] maturing he says in second Corinthians
[45:38] that your fa when your faith is
[45:39] increased not that when you finally
[45:41] believe but when your faith is increased
[45:43] there's a measures of Faith there's an
[45:44] increase there's a grow of faith in
[45:45] Ephesians till we all come into the
[45:47] unity of the faith to the statute of a
[45:49] perfect man what that's Faith
[45:51] growing first Thessalonians 3:10 night
[45:53] and day praying exceedingly this is Paul
[45:55] I pray night and day exceedingly that we
[45:57] might see your face and might perfect
[46:00] that which is lacking in your faith this
[46:03] is the desire of an apostle for the
[46:04] people I I want to come and minister to
[46:07] you that I might perfect what is lacking
[46:10] in your faith not give you Faith you
[46:12] brutes you rebels you people full of
[46:14] unbelief but I want to take what's not
[46:17] perfect in your faith and add to it that
[46:19] it might be without
[46:22] lack and how do that happen Faith cometh
[46:25] by hearing Romans 10:17 Faith cometh by
[46:28] hearing and hearing by the word of
[46:31] God not sure if we used these before I
[46:33] skipped over a large portion a couple
[46:35] weeks ago brother Bram in the message
[46:36] hear ye himym says Mr arganbright said
[46:38] to me that number seven because he's
[46:40] calling prayer cards he says number
[46:42] seven was already healed while I was
[46:45] preaching praise the Lord that's good
[46:48] that's the original
[46:51] way I wish Tommy Osborne if he' had come
[46:54] tonight that's his he's talking about
[46:56] God that's his way of doing it he wished
[46:58] brother he wish his brother Tommy
[47:00] Osborne was there to see that this is
[47:02] the ultimate why because I think it was
[47:04] brother Tommy Osborne who saw when
[47:06] brother brandham was doing healings and
[47:08] all these things he looked at if I'm not
[47:10] mistaken uh uh brother Tommy osor looked
[47:13] at says I can do that that's exactly
[47:16] what he thought oh I see what brother
[47:18] bram's doing I could do that and brother
[47:19] Bram saying I wish he was here I I I I I
[47:22] wish he was here so that he could he
[47:24] could see that this isn't the ultimate
[47:27] I think it was brother Lee Val that said
[47:28] that told that story of Tommy Osborne
[47:29] how he said when I saw that he said' I
[47:31] could do that brother Lee said I could
[47:33] see visions and Technicolor and I knew I
[47:35] could never do something like
[47:37] that but that's the original way that's
[47:40] his way of doing it preaching the word
[47:43] and that's the way to do it preaching
[47:44] the word and to get healed by preaching
[47:48] God sent his word and what did it do
[47:51] heal them that's right that's
[47:54] good that's the original way is
[47:57] preaching the
[47:58] word so the ultimate outcome is not that
[48:02] you're healed but faith in
[48:04] God and the original way think of that
[48:07] the original way to be healed is by the
[48:10] word being preached that's the original
[48:14] way he
[48:22] says I'm going to skip
[48:27] I'm skipping this again for the second
[48:29] time but we're just going to have to do
[48:30] it brother well I have to read a portion
[48:33] of this and the end time sign seed
[48:36] brother R's talking about a 17-year-old
[48:37] girl who's laying on a
[48:39] stretcher uh she had cancer and he makes
[48:41] the statement this girl cannot live and
[48:43] I think he says this at the beginning of
[48:44] the service and so uh he's he's talking
[48:48] this kind of telling the story she's
[48:50] Afflicted she's with on a stretcher
[48:51] she's gonna die brother B says to prove
[48:54] something to my church I never touched
[48:56] the child at all I never as much as
[48:57] touched her now hold that in your mind
[49:00] to prove something he never touched
[49:02] her now it's not that there would have
[49:05] been something bad if he touched her
[49:08] it's not that if he touched her he you
[49:09] know something bad was going to happen
[49:10] but he wanted to prove something to the
[49:12] church he says so I never touched the
[49:13] child at all went right to the pulpit
[49:15] with the word stayed right with the word
[49:17] and the word healed her so instantly
[49:19] until she got up and walked away is all
[49:22] right now living like anybody else can't
[49:24] find a trace of it anywhere never even
[49:26] touch tched her see the word went forth
[49:28] and she believed the word and the word
[49:31] is God's life and God's power and the
[49:33] word is what does it the word heals the
[49:36] sick and in that scenario her faith
[49:39] could have only been in the word right
[49:42] cuz there was nothing else it wasn't
[49:44] like they called brother Mesmer to the
[49:46] organ it's not that brother brandham got
[49:48] up there and cracked his knuckles and
[49:50] called for the dotera and just got all
[49:52] ready and smacked her on the
[49:54] forehead right and and and all of a
[49:56] sudden she's like man next time I'm sick
[49:58] I'm just going to I'm going to come and
[49:59] have that happen again it could have
[50:01] only been
[50:02] Christ there there was there was nothing
[50:04] else in the picture it was Christ only
[50:07] it was the word being preached so I just
[50:10] I I I did this to prove a point this is
[50:13] what he says I did it to prove a point I
[50:14] never so much touched her I went to the
[50:16] word I went to the pulpit immediately
[50:17] with just the word stayed right with the
[50:19] word and the word healed her
[50:20] instantly I I would say that there's a a
[50:23] lot of conscious intent here with
[50:26] brother brandom and a lot of humility to
[50:28] where it would have been easy for him to
[50:30] vindicate himself by saying you young
[50:32] lady in this stretcher you can't live
[50:34] unless God does something for you
[50:36] impress himself and even by her own
[50:38] desire to be healed manifest some gift
[50:41] demonstrate some
[50:43] discernment and which is the power of
[50:46] God and then her to be healed but he
[50:49] says I wanted to prove something so I
[50:51] just laid in the word now why would he
[50:54] need to prove something
[50:56] I'll acknowledge that uh this is this is
[51:00] my this is my uh
[51:04] tie-in and so I I'm not brother B
[51:07] doesn't say the reason why I tried the
[51:08] reason why I had to prove it he just
[51:09] says to prove something I never touched
[51:11] her and he demonstrated that the word
[51:15] preached could heal
[51:17] somebody and and I say for me the way it
[51:20] strikes me is he needed to prove
[51:22] something to this church had seen these
[51:24] miracles for so long because there's a
[51:26] Tipping
[51:28] Point there's a Tipping Point for the
[51:30] positive and for the negative and so
[51:33] brother brandham knew it's reaching
[51:35] critical mass where they've got to have
[51:37] their emphasis on the
[51:39] word that that's got to be what they
[51:41] begin to take the holding because why
[51:44] people were making him God people were
[51:46] putting way too much emphasis on him
[51:48] other people were thinking oh prayer
[51:49] lines run this run that all sorts of
[51:51] impersonations so I got to bring it back
[51:53] to the word because there's a Tipping
[51:55] Point both for the negative but also for
[51:56] the
[51:58] positive on one side there's a point at
[52:01] which once you reach it and go past it
[52:04] your faith is
[52:06] weakened but on the other side there's a
[52:09] Tipping Point where with the momentum of
[52:11] God's word your faith is actually
[52:15] perfected it's interesting which way
[52:17] that could go the Tipping Point is a
[52:19] point at which a series of small
[52:21] incidents become significant enough to
[52:23] cause a larger more important change
[52:27] some interesting debate points on the
[52:30] atmology of a Tipping Point a tip point
[52:33] in these things but the way that it's
[52:35] used now is to identify a series of
[52:39] things series of events and happenings
[52:42] that are imperceptible essentially maybe
[52:45] they're they're not real large they're
[52:47] incremental not any real giant things
[52:50] happening but one after another they
[52:51] just kind of build and build but it
[52:53] builds to a certain point to where all
[52:54] of a sudden it tips
[52:57] right and there's there's scholarship on
[52:59] it there's books on it I'm not so much
[53:01] trying to focus on uh how Malcolm
[53:03] Gladwell brother Gladwell would put it
[53:06] uh though it was a very fascinating book
[53:08] but it's an idea that things reach a
[53:09] boiling point like well how did we get
[53:11] here it took time and little things were
[53:13] happening but it gets that point to
[53:15] where you may be seen those things where
[53:16] something's filling up and filling up
[53:17] and filling up and all it dumps because
[53:19] there's going to be a point where that
[53:21] momentum tips it it's a point of
[53:23] critical
[53:24] mass and so there's a there's a that
[53:27] that idea exists in the word of God line
[53:29] upon line precept upon precept word upon
[53:32] word in the sermon perfect faith brother
[53:34] is the word operate in human flesh by
[53:36] physical signs material Signs by
[53:38] scriptural signs perfectly to bring you
[53:40] to a perfect faith for a perfect
[53:42] Rapture that that's the way that it
[53:44] ought to be working sign after sign
[53:46] Wonder after Wonder material after
[53:47] material all these things happening to
[53:49] bring you to a perfect faith for perfect
[53:51] Rapture listen all this word one day is
[53:53] going to reach a Tipping Point and this
[53:55] body is going to go
[53:57] right it's going to change one day why
[53:59] because that body is going to
[54:01] materialize around the word that you're
[54:03] feeding
[54:04] on that word that you're watering is
[54:06] going to lead you to your unseen
[54:08] bridegroom one day and it's going to be
[54:10] incremental step by step inch by inch
[54:13] fiding every step of the way and one day
[54:15] it's going to reach a Tipping Point and
[54:17] faith is going to be made
[54:18] perfect that's how it happened with
[54:20] Abraham right just a regular routine of
[54:23] following the scripture the plans of God
[54:25] that's how you get to Supreme faith
[54:26] brother Brown said in spiritual food due
[54:29] season he says I want you to get built
[54:30] up now in the Holy Oracles of God in the
[54:33] faith the faith of this hour the faith
[54:36] it's going to take more faith than ever
[54:37] was in any age for this has to be
[54:39] rapturing Faith to be taken up and so we
[54:42] want you to believe tonight in all that
[54:44] you have seen heard the word that you've
[54:47] heard preached the signs and wonders
[54:48] that you've seen done believe in it
[54:51] don't look back and begin to doubt it
[54:53] well I guess we're supposed to be Beyond
[54:55] this I guess that never happened no no
[54:58] if you hadn't been there you need to go
[55:00] there right if if you haven't if you've
[55:04] never had that alter experience in your
[55:06] heart if you've never had a born again
[55:08] experience if you've never had the
[55:09] genuine Pentecostal experience which is
[55:11] to be born again by the baptism of the
[55:12] Holy Ghost you got to have it and just
[55:15] because there's a teaching in the word
[55:16] of God that we've got to come to a place
[55:18] of maturity doesn't mean we look back on
[55:20] that like ah hogwash nothing to it
[55:22] you'll never get to maturity unless
[55:23] you've been born
[55:26] but he says he wants you to think about
[55:28] it believe it all you've seen believe
[55:30] all you heard believe everything that's
[55:32] been preached believe the signs and
[55:33] wonders he says we want you to
[55:36] accumulate all that together in your
[55:38] heart and consider whether it be of God
[55:40] or not so he says I Want to Build You Up
[55:42] in the Holy Oracles of God in the faith
[55:44] the faith of this hour and in order to
[55:47] achieve the faith of this hour he wants
[55:49] to use the momentum of all that God has
[55:51] done so there must be a cumulative
[55:54] effect of all the things that God is
[55:56] doing to bring you to perfect faith not
[55:59] to cabbage down on something but it must
[56:02] all be working to build momentum to a
[56:04] place of perfect Faith the faith of this
[56:06] hour the faith to be changed it's going
[56:08] to take more faith in this age than
[56:10] there ever was in any other
[56:12] age and you have to this has to we have
[56:14] to keep this in mind the purpose of it
[56:17] because if we lose focus the devil
[56:18] fights this wonderful truth of Divine
[56:20] Healing and marks it
[56:21] up he would love just to Twist it just a
[56:24] little bit
[56:29] that sigh
[56:30] is it's the after
[56:33] hour and I I I think I should probably
[56:37] stop
[56:40] eventually so let me just look at this
[56:43] for a moment to see where I could
[56:53] stop let's just go
[57:02] now the Tipping Point on the other
[57:06] side because there's a Tipping Point of
[57:08] the accumulation of Faith to bring us to
[57:09] a perfect faith for a
[57:11] Rapture now the I want you to hear these
[57:14] statements and just recognize that
[57:16] brother brandham is
[57:18] taking maybe taking the risk but feeling
[57:21] impressed enough to at least acknowledge
[57:24] something that's happening within his
[57:25] meetings he says in the sermon angel of
[57:27] God in 47 now the angel of God had told
[57:29] me that it would come to pass that they
[57:31] wouldn't believe unless there was a
[57:33] miracle and your words have been
[57:36] proved he's warned by the angel Lord
[57:39] there's going to come a point where the
[57:40] people won't even believe you anymore
[57:42] unless you do a
[57:43] miracle now that has to be
[57:45] counterproductive right that he sends
[57:48] his word and so he gives signs and
[57:50] wonders that you might believe his word
[57:53] ultimately so that you could go oh
[57:55] that's exactly what he said
[57:56] I'll believe his word I'll take him at
[57:58] his word but it has a negative effect
[58:00] eventually he says the angel Lord's
[58:02] acknowledging this Tipping Point that
[58:04] would come to a point where the people
[58:06] would get so jaded that they wouldn't
[58:08] take you at your word but they would
[58:10] make you perform a miracle in order to
[58:13] believe four years later he says the
[58:16] same thing in a similar sermon Angel of
[58:18] the Lord you say brother brandham you
[58:20] pray for me you believe I'll get well
[58:22] yes I can believe it but I won't know it
[58:24] until he tells me so
[58:28] then when I see the vision that's it
[58:29] then I know it's going to be so there's
[58:31] a can you pray for me and tell me I'm
[58:33] going to get it well and he says well I
[58:34] can't I can't tell you that thus sayith
[58:36] the Lord that Vision unless he shows it
[58:38] to me and he
[58:41] says he says this
[58:45] that and in doing that that weakens my
[58:48] faith a little on the other
[58:51] side
[58:52] okay because I get a vision that
[58:56] someone's going to be healed it has some
[58:58] opposite effect on the other side he
[59:02] says because I'm looking to that direct
[59:04] positive side
[59:06] always out just to give an example I
[59:09] believe it was was this is in 1964 I
[59:11] believe he preaches in Topeka and
[59:12] there's a minister that' been crushed by
[59:14] something and and he was very burdened
[59:16] for this Minister and he's like oh I
[59:17] just wish God would give me a vision to
[59:19] go into that H that hospital lay give me
[59:21] a vision of him being healed I'd walk
[59:23] right into that hospital and say thus
[59:24] sayith the Lord you rise out of this bed
[59:26] and be made well and then it Dawn on the
[59:28] same faith that I would have in the
[59:29] vision to tell him he can be well is the
[59:31] same faith that I could take to pray for
[59:33] him and believe that it'll get
[59:35] well and so that's to me like the
[59:37] perfect the beautiful order and the
[59:39] symmetry of it that he's realizing that
[59:41] if God will do it in this Supernatural
[59:43] way could he not do it in this way is it
[59:45] not the same faith and and he's
[59:48] identifying just how that's an example
[59:50] how it began to weaken him a little is
[59:52] he was like man I I I really wish I
[59:53] could pray for this brother but I don't
[59:55] have a vision
[59:57] I really wish he could get well but God
[59:59] hasn't showed him anything he's like
[1:00:00] wait a minute wait a minute I'm looking
[1:00:02] too much to this Vision this direct
[1:00:04] positive side and it's weakened my faith
[1:00:07] in the promise lay hands on the sick
[1:00:09] pray for them and they'll
[1:00:11] recover he said that's what hurts in my
[1:00:13] meetings many
[1:00:14] times the people watch to get in the
[1:00:18] line to get that direct positive side of
[1:00:21] what's going to happen to
[1:00:23] them that that's a that's a
[1:00:26] statement they miss the point they get
[1:00:28] in the line to get that direct positive
[1:00:31] side side and he says the fact that the
[1:00:32] supernaturalist demonstrated itself has
[1:00:35] brought the people to a point where they
[1:00:36] won't believe unless there's a miracle
[1:00:38] and that it actually hinders him in his
[1:00:39] meetings because people come up in the
[1:00:41] line and they want to see the
[1:00:43] supernatural not take God at his word
[1:00:47] and they've missed the whole point and
[1:00:48] basis of it and when you miss the point
[1:00:52] and basis for Divine Healing the whole
[1:00:55] in this in the desire and seeking it it
[1:00:58] can actually weaken your
[1:00:59] faith I'll pick up on it on next
[1:01:02] Sunday where you begin to Major on a
[1:01:04] minor and it'll never
[1:01:06] work brother Bram says in the
[1:01:08] unchangeable god that's the reason they
[1:01:09] give prayer cards if you don't you'll
[1:01:11] come right back in the line again come
[1:01:13] back again it just weakens your faith
[1:01:16] each time go weaker and weaker weaker
[1:01:18] and
[1:01:19] weaker so it's not it's not uh this
[1:01:22] isn't a statement against prayer lines
[1:01:24] it's a statement against human
[1:01:27] nature to to make an idol out of the
[1:01:31] line and to engage in the traditional
[1:01:34] approach to the hands or the laying on
[1:01:36] of hands the anointing with oil and
[1:01:37] whatever it might be to the point to
[1:01:39] where I he says I have prayer cards
[1:01:41] because if we just opened it up the same
[1:01:43] people would always be coming through
[1:01:45] and I would do them a disservice because
[1:01:47] they're going to come through looking
[1:01:48] for something to happen and it not
[1:01:50] happened and they're going to go out
[1:01:51] like well it didn't work I better come
[1:01:53] through the line again and they're not
[1:01:55] coming through the line again with the
[1:01:57] faith that's been bolstered or
[1:01:59] encouraged but one that's a little bit
[1:02:01] more less hopeful and more anxious it
[1:02:04] didn't work the first time I wonder if
[1:02:06] it'll work this time and you can
[1:02:07] actually set yourself up for failure by
[1:02:10] continuing to repeat a certain kind of
[1:02:12] behavior and it never achieves the
[1:02:14] results you want it to he says it
[1:02:16] weakens your faith each
[1:02:18] time the mess is perseverant what's the
[1:02:20] use of coming up here if you're just
[1:02:22] walking up here talking about the prayer
[1:02:24] line you walk through Tommy hi line and
[1:02:26] Tommy Osborne and or Roberts and back
[1:02:28] and forth through the line it only
[1:02:29] weakens your faith this is brother
[1:02:31] Brandon pointing to something I realize
[1:02:33] I've run out of time today to really
[1:02:34] amplify this but brother RS pointing to
[1:02:38] a Tipping Point he's not preaching
[1:02:40] against prayer lines not preach against
[1:02:43] laying on his hands not preach against
[1:02:44] Divine Healing not giving us all sorts
[1:02:46] of material that we can use as a codal
[1:02:48] to beat up the Evangelist and beat up
[1:02:50] the prayer lines and beat up the
[1:02:51] conventions and beat up no absolutely
[1:02:53] not if anything he's wanting us to
[1:02:55] realize realiz that the reason why those
[1:02:57] things aren't effective sometimes is
[1:03:00] because we've missed the whole point of
[1:03:02] those things to begin
[1:03:05] with and it becomes a
[1:03:07] cycle just a circle he's saying it's a
[1:03:10] line you never get out of it you're just
[1:03:11] walking in circles he says it only
[1:03:13] weakens your faith I've been in this
[1:03:14] person's line that person's line this
[1:03:15] person's line every year praying for the
[1:03:17] same thing only weakens your faith
[1:03:18] that's all when you come here with the
[1:03:19] full assurance that you're not walking
[1:03:21] before your brother or anyone else
[1:03:23] you're coming here because the spirit of
[1:03:24] God is in you has bid you come something
[1:03:27] is going to happen that's the basis for
[1:03:30] it there isn't anything going to keep
[1:03:32] you from it until then you're just on a
[1:03:35] walk right around next Minister comes in
[1:03:38] town right around next Minister comes
[1:03:40] right around just on a
[1:03:43] walk just old Johnny
[1:03:45] Crow walking in a circle just on a walk
[1:03:49] that's no good there's nothing in a
[1:03:50] preacher no more there is in your
[1:03:51] husband or your brother or whoever it
[1:03:52] might be remember waiting for a special
[1:03:56] time a special evangelist the super
[1:03:58] duper Divine healings and things he says
[1:04:01] anybody he says we're just
[1:04:02] representative of his telling you the
[1:04:04] word some of them sa have different
[1:04:06] gifts which the Bible speaks of these
[1:04:08] gifts this is all done to vindicate his
[1:04:13] presence what's the whole point of it
[1:04:15] all to vindicate his presence this is
[1:04:18] the original way
[1:04:28] God wants you to take him at his word
[1:04:30] this is all done to vindicate his
[1:04:54] presence I'm not asking I'm just going
[1:04:56] to make a statement an hour and a half
[1:04:57] isn't long I mean it really really
[1:05:01] isn't I
[1:05:04] mean never mind yeah it's just it's just
[1:05:07] not
[1:05:09] long God wants our faith to become F
[1:05:12] perfect
[1:05:13] faith in Luke Chapter 5:1 17 it came to
[1:05:16] pass on a certain day as he was
[1:05:17] teaching that there are Pharisees and
[1:05:19] doctors of law sitting by which were
[1:05:22] come out of every town of Galilee and
[1:05:23] Judea and Jerusalem teaching just
[1:05:26] teaching and the power of the Lord was
[1:05:28] present to heal them
[1:05:30] all why because it was done to vindicate
[1:05:33] his presence the preaching of the word
[1:05:35] is done to vindicate his presence the
[1:05:36] gifts and different things are all done
[1:05:38] to vindicate his presence that's the
[1:05:39] purpose of the Gospel the word is what
[1:05:43] declares Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is
[1:05:46] the Living Word that makes God present
[1:05:49] that's the whole purpose brother BR says
[1:05:50] and then Jesus came oh I want you to
[1:05:52] believe without hands laying on just
[1:05:55] simply believe that the presence of the
[1:05:56] Lord is here to heal the
[1:05:58] sick this is what he wanted this is his
[1:06:01] heart's cry he makes this uh this
[1:06:03] similar statement in other places many
[1:06:04] times I want you to believe without
[1:06:06] hands being laid on you I just want you
[1:06:08] to Simply believe that the presence of
[1:06:10] the Lord is here to heal the sick that
[1:06:11] by the preach of the word you would
[1:06:13] believe that Jesus Christ is present
[1:06:15] that his ministry is this to declare him
[1:06:17] that he is here and that in the word
[1:06:18] being preached you believe that he's
[1:06:20] present to deliver you from
[1:06:22] anything to take him at his word believe
[1:06:25] that the presence of the Lord is here to
[1:06:26] heal the
[1:06:27] sick now the next statement if the Lord
[1:06:31] will come here and prove to you that his
[1:06:33] presence is here then whose fault is
[1:06:36] it yours is
[1:06:39] right it's my fault the word is preached
[1:06:43] and then as if to
[1:06:46] create a a a greater damnation he says
[1:06:49] the word is preached to believe that
[1:06:51] he's here and if you would come and
[1:06:52] prove his presence is here then it's
[1:06:54] your fault then to stare it in the face
[1:06:56] and not believe
[1:07:00] it why does he want him to believe
[1:07:02] without hands because that's the
[1:07:03] original
[1:07:04] way why is it it's your fault if he
[1:07:07] comes behind it and vindicates it with
[1:07:09] signs and wonders proving that the word
[1:07:11] that was preached was right why would it
[1:07:13] be your fault because that's the reason
[1:07:14] and purpose of all the gifts to begin
[1:07:16] with to trust
[1:07:19] God let me just point to this very
[1:07:21] quickly this message is a restoration
[1:07:23] back to the original that right it's
[1:07:25] what this message is it's it's not a
[1:07:27] Reformation it's a reform it's a a
[1:07:30] restoration back to the original and to
[1:07:33] get back to the original this is the
[1:07:35] Paradigm Shift maybe to get back to the
[1:07:37] original God uses signs and
[1:07:40] wonders in the ministry of brother
[1:07:42] brandham he didn't just show up in 1933
[1:07:44] and says you got to go back to the
[1:07:46] beginning folks got to go back to the
[1:07:49] beginning and just some guys stand on
[1:07:51] the street corner seventh and pin and
[1:07:52] Jeffersonville got to go back to
[1:07:54] beginning folks God used the signs and
[1:07:56] wonders God used the Vindication to get
[1:07:58] the people's confidence if you could get
[1:08:00] the people to believe nothing would
[1:08:01] stand in their way he used to get back
[1:08:03] to the original he uses signs and
[1:08:05] wonders so the restoration of Pentecost
[1:08:08] signs wonders tongues the different ways
[1:08:09] that brother man refers to it was
[1:08:12] necessary to fulfill the potential of
[1:08:16] Pentecost we couldn't bypass that these
[1:08:18] things couldn't be eroded and you
[1:08:19] couldn't fall away from it and then
[1:08:21] we're just going to bypass it you had to
[1:08:23] come back to it brother BR said Luther
[1:08:24] Wesley p cost the
[1:08:27] Capstone right you know how that he goes
[1:08:29] 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 and he does that in many
[1:08:32] different places this last great step is
[1:08:33] on into Perfection there had to be there
[1:08:35] couldn't be this Gap Luther Wesley and
[1:08:37] then
[1:08:39] nothing there had to be this there had
[1:08:41] to be a step forward he says from Wesley
[1:08:43] it went to Pentecost and from Pentecost
[1:08:45] to make the Original Seed the
[1:08:47] restoration of the gifts the restoration
[1:08:49] of signs and wonders these things they
[1:08:52] come but after that something is to
[1:08:55] happen
[1:08:57] right that this is I realize maybe at
[1:08:59] this point I've spent so much time in
[1:09:01] this that it could be very very obvious
[1:09:03] to me and not necessarily so much
[1:09:04] obvious to you that it all builds you
[1:09:07] can't kick any of this out but it's
[1:09:09] coming to a point where produces
[1:09:12] something and that's when brother says
[1:09:14] to prove something it's it's not that
[1:09:16] his ministry was entirely without any
[1:09:18] signs and wonders and miracles and he
[1:09:20] goes I just want you to believe that
[1:09:21] you're healed and just think that you're
[1:09:22] healed and go home telling yourself
[1:09:24] you're well he wanted the people to
[1:09:25] realize that everything God has done to
[1:09:27] visibly manifest himself amongst us was
[1:09:30] so that we could further trust him not
[1:09:33] just the visible manifestation because
[1:09:35] Satan can impersonate any of
[1:09:37] those and the plot
[1:09:40] thickens you could even lay hands on the
[1:09:42] speak with new tongues and cast out
[1:09:44] devils and do many wonderful Works in
[1:09:46] his name and you go sorry I don't know
[1:09:48] who you
[1:09:52] are in Numbers chapter 20 we went
[1:09:55] through this on Wednesday
[1:09:58] night but in Numbers chapter 20: 7-2 and
[1:10:01] the Lord spake unto Moses saying take
[1:10:02] the rod and gather out the assembly
[1:10:05] together oh I realized now when I said
[1:10:07] an hour and a half you thought total no
[1:10:09] I meant from that point on like another
[1:10:11] hour and a half wouldn't be long that
[1:10:14] might have been where the Mis there was
[1:10:15] a misunderstanding I
[1:10:18] apologize we won't preach Tuesday night
[1:10:20] if that'll make you feel better and the
[1:10:22] Lord spake unto Moses saying take the
[1:10:24] rod and gather out the assembly together
[1:10:25] together thou and Aaron thy brother now
[1:10:27] the rod is the instrument that he th
[1:10:29] cast down before pharaoh and turned into
[1:10:31] a serpent the rod is the instrument that
[1:10:32] he smoke the Red Sea this this Rod is
[1:10:35] very visible in the eyes of the people
[1:10:37] this Rod is what smoted the Rock in
[1:10:38] Exodus 17 but now God says take the Rock
[1:10:41] and speak ye under the rock before their
[1:10:43] eyes and it shall give forth his water
[1:10:46] and thou shalt bring forth to them water
[1:10:49] out of the
[1:10:51] rock not by smiting The Rock but by the
[1:10:54] word word it's going to usher for it's
[1:10:57] going to bring the word will bring it
[1:10:59] out of the rock not break it out of it
[1:11:02] not Smite it out of it but just the word
[1:11:04] itself would be enough to cause it to
[1:11:07] release itself and what an image it
[1:11:10] would be of people who have Stony
[1:11:12] hearts and how that God is able of these
[1:11:15] stones to raise up children to Abraham
[1:11:17] by his word he's to do it not by brute
[1:11:19] force not by legalism but by the word he
[1:11:22] wants to turn your heart into a Fountain
[1:11:24] of Living water amen and he says so the
[1:11:28] congregation and so the congregation
[1:11:30] give the congregation and their Beast
[1:11:31] drink out of that rock and Moses took
[1:11:34] the rod from before the Lord as he
[1:11:35] commanded so far so good and Moses
[1:11:37] gather the congregation before the rock
[1:11:39] so far so good and he said unto them
[1:11:41] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:11:42] minute wait a minute Moses you're
[1:11:44] supposed to speak to the Rock not
[1:11:46] them and with the hardness of a rock
[1:11:49] here now you rebels must we fetch you
[1:11:52] water out of this rock and Moses lifted
[1:11:54] up his hand not to swear to God not to
[1:11:58] speak but with the rod and with his Rod
[1:12:01] smot The
[1:12:02] Rock Exodus 17 it came forth it doesn't
[1:12:07] happen so he smites it
[1:12:10] again and in just in a
[1:12:14] instant water came out abundantly that's
[1:12:16] a shocking picture and the congregation
[1:12:19] drank and their Beast
[1:12:20] also God said you will bring forth water
[1:12:23] out of the Rock and give to the
[1:12:23] congregation and their Beast to drink so
[1:12:25] smites The Rock twice water comes out
[1:12:27] they drink and then he it it's there's
[1:12:30] no hesitation at all and the Lord spake
[1:12:32] unto Moses and Aaron because ye believed
[1:12:36] me
[1:12:37] not recognize the phrase because you did
[1:12:40] not believe
[1:12:42] me believe me to believe me in order to
[1:12:46] believe me to sanctify me in the eyes of
[1:12:48] the children of Israel therefore you
[1:12:50] shall not bring this congregation into
[1:12:51] the land which I've given them that
[1:12:54] that's that seems
[1:12:56] extreme right but really you just look
[1:12:59] over you can look at Moses's life see a
[1:13:01] certain
[1:13:02] pattern but it was because it was that
[1:13:05] important what was being expressed here
[1:13:08] I know I've been long today but my
[1:13:11] Summer's just about over and so why we
[1:13:13] still have maybe some summer left for us
[1:13:15] I'm just going to take advantage of it
[1:13:17] but he says because you believed me
[1:13:19] not in other words Moses's Faith ought
[1:13:22] to have been greater at this point
[1:13:24] wasn't it Moses didn't believe at all if
[1:13:27] Moses had no faith he be like who's
[1:13:29] talking right yeah whatever the rod go
[1:13:33] some you talk to a rock you think I'm
[1:13:35] crazy no I mean Moses didn't he knew it
[1:13:37] was God he knew water would come from
[1:13:40] The Rock he didn't raise that rod and
[1:13:42] smite The Rock disbelieving in God's
[1:13:44] power to what bring forth water from a
[1:13:47] rock by striking it with a rod his
[1:13:49] experience had taught him that but there
[1:13:52] was something lacking in his faith now
[1:13:55] now God says because you believed me not
[1:13:57] you won't go into the promised land but
[1:13:59] if we were just to see it we didn't know
[1:14:00] this private conversation between God
[1:14:02] and Moses we would have seen Moses and
[1:14:05] Aaron are talking to God Moses comes out
[1:14:06] with the rod Moses walks up to the Rock
[1:14:08] doesn't Smite it once he smites it twice
[1:14:10] like yeah double portion woo right right
[1:14:14] it's getting better not just once twice
[1:14:16] next time Moses do it three times three
[1:14:18] times seven right that we we'd be
[1:14:21] looking at just on the face of it and
[1:14:22] have all sorts of ideas of what we
[1:14:24] think's happening but God in his private
[1:14:26] conversation with Moses says you didn't
[1:14:27] believe me and if we just watch Moses
[1:14:30] walk to the Rock use the rod and smite
[1:14:32] it Moses appears to have succeeded signs
[1:14:35] and wonders refreshment of the people he
[1:14:37] wrought A great miracle water poured
[1:14:39] forth from the rock but God says Moses
[1:14:42] you missed an
[1:14:43] opportunity what opportunity did he miss
[1:14:46] to sanctify to glorify me before their
[1:14:51] eyes Moses smoke The Rock and water came
[1:14:54] forth excellent God you said you wanted
[1:14:56] them to drink and they're Beast it's
[1:14:58] happening right now exactly what you
[1:15:00] wanted exactly according to what you the
[1:15:02] the outcome you were trying to produce
[1:15:03] and God's like no no that's not what I
[1:15:05] wanted I wanted them to get out of this
[1:15:08] habit of always complaining wanted to
[1:15:10] get out of this habit of no longer
[1:15:11] trusting me this they're always getting
[1:15:13] this point where Moses you brought us
[1:15:15] out in the wildness no no no no no Moses
[1:15:16] didn't bring you out into the Wilderness
[1:15:18] God did Ah that's right God did so he
[1:15:21] has a plan right there was so much of
[1:15:24] the focus that that where things were it
[1:15:26] wasn't producing even this far down the
[1:15:29] road you missed an opportunity to
[1:15:31] sanctify me before their eyes God wanted
[1:15:35] to reveal a greater power by Moses
[1:15:38] speaking to the
[1:15:39] Rock he wanted to bring forth a greater
[1:15:42] Faith he says you failed to create Trust
[1:15:45] in Me by speaking to the Rock before
[1:15:48] their eyes that's what you failed to do
[1:15:51] yes they drink yes they're receiving
[1:15:53] something Supernatural but it didn't
[1:15:56] instigate a greater faith in me you had
[1:15:58] an
[1:16:00] opportunity 38 years earlier in Exodus
[1:16:03] 37 he smot The Rock and water came that
[1:16:06] was in the beginning of the Exodus but
[1:16:08] now almost 40 years later God is wanting
[1:16:10] a greater
[1:16:11] demonstration well what could be greater
[1:16:13] than to Smite it twice what could be
[1:16:16] greater than to than to to show a
[1:16:18] greater fervency and a greater effort
[1:16:20] and a greater striking point but if I
[1:16:22] could say this they had reached this
[1:16:24] critical point in the journey where
[1:16:26] their faith needed to run at a higher
[1:16:29] level because they're going to need to
[1:16:31] cross the Jordan and possess the
[1:16:33] promised land and they were going to
[1:16:34] need to trust God that in the face of
[1:16:37] giants in the face of an insurmountable
[1:16:39] enemy that God would do exactly what he
[1:16:42] said and he wanted them to see that the
[1:16:44] word in their mouths can accomplish the
[1:16:47] hardest
[1:16:51] things Moses then by striking the rock
[1:16:54] actually
[1:16:55] worked against the Perfection of
[1:16:57] Israel's faith in the
[1:17:00] promise even though it produced a
[1:17:02] miracle it worked against the Perfection
[1:17:04] of their faith to take God at his word
[1:17:07] here at the doorstep of crossing over I
[1:17:10] could take God at his word and possess
[1:17:13] my mountain and possess the land and I
[1:17:15] like oh oh brother brenon would you
[1:17:16] please brother brenon would you please
[1:17:18] brother Moses would you please brother
[1:17:19] would you
[1:17:21] please listen to what brother brandham
[1:17:23] has to say about it the in iciency of
[1:17:25] the word is what Moses he says Moses
[1:17:28] testified to it the insufficiency of the
[1:17:31] word Moses testified to it the word
[1:17:33] wasn't right he had to be smitten
[1:17:36] again Moses testified by smiting The
[1:17:39] Rock twice that the word was
[1:17:42] insufficient you listening what a better
[1:17:45] way to get you through an hour and a
[1:17:46] half right the this statement is so
[1:17:49] striking Moses by striking the rock
[1:17:52] twice said the word wasn't right it's
[1:17:55] the insufficiency of the word he says in
[1:17:57] another place Moses when he did it it
[1:17:59] spoke to the weakness of the blood of
[1:18:04] Christ brother Bram said God's words to
[1:18:07] him you glorified yourself you took my
[1:18:10] power instead of sanctifying me you
[1:18:12] Sanctified yourself a Tipping
[1:18:17] Point brother BR says it broke the whole
[1:18:20] plan but he gave him his permissive will
[1:18:23] he broke the whole plan by smiting The
[1:18:25] Rock twice but God still let the water
[1:18:28] come
[1:18:31] permissively in the sermon the children
[1:18:32] of Israel I'm just reading these things
[1:18:35] because the perfect will of God and the
[1:18:36] permissive will of God he says this in
[1:18:37] Phoenix there's a perfect will of God
[1:18:39] there's a permissive will of God God
[1:18:41] permitted his Prophet to go on talking
[1:18:43] about balam yet it wasn't his perfect
[1:18:46] will this so the the context of this is
[1:18:49] Moses should have spoke to the Rock and
[1:18:51] the water would have come forth but he
[1:18:53] smites it twice when he does that he
[1:18:55] says the word isn't enough the word is
[1:18:57] insufficient the blood is too weak it
[1:18:59] glorified himself and it became
[1:19:02] permissive
[1:19:03] will God permitted it now this is what
[1:19:06] permissive will is and in the the image
[1:19:08] of balam it was his permissive will I
[1:19:11] feel this afternoon it's the same thing
[1:19:13] on working these for this miracle line
[1:19:17] with those healing lines the prayer
[1:19:18] lines we called Miracle lines it's may
[1:19:20] be permissive will but it's not as
[1:19:23] perfect will you're supposed to take my
[1:19:27] word and there's different places where
[1:19:30] brother's talking about the platform
[1:19:32] healings what is it he's referring to
[1:19:34] says it's hindered me in my meetings
[1:19:35] sometimes everybody's looking to what's
[1:19:37] happening on the platform becomes a show
[1:19:40] it's actually on
[1:19:41] stage it's why the third pull is
[1:19:44] different because the word has
[1:19:45] preeminence he's talking about these
[1:19:47] platform healings and he says God used
[1:19:49] it but I never thought it was his direct
[1:19:51] will it's been his permissive will
[1:19:55] permissive will not perverted will God's
[1:19:59] permitting it God's allowing it God's
[1:20:00] blessing it but it's not the
[1:20:05] ultimate in the sermon at Thy word he's
[1:20:07] talking about how he spoke to a man's
[1:20:09] arm that was uh mangled and it
[1:20:11] straightened out he said now that's the
[1:20:13] major and the real way that God wants to
[1:20:15] operate this this is just his permissive
[1:20:18] will this way it's just when I come here
[1:20:21] and pray and cry and beg to him before
[1:20:24] coming until that it's laying so close
[1:20:26] it forces me into it and you see the
[1:20:27] vision it'll cut off on the platform
[1:20:30] platform healings he's saying and
[1:20:32] there's so much here that I'm just
[1:20:33] pointing to maybe kind of wetting your
[1:20:35] appetite to go in and search these
[1:20:36] things out he's saying this is this is
[1:20:39] just I don't think this is the perfect
[1:20:40] will of God the way that it operates
[1:20:42] these things just come too quick and
[1:20:44] they go I'm begging I'm crying I'm
[1:20:45] pleading I'm trying to build this up
[1:20:46] because but the major in real way that
[1:20:48] God would want me to operate my gift is
[1:20:49] just to speak the word and it would have
[1:20:50] the
[1:20:52] results permissive will
[1:20:56] brother random says the seede shall not
[1:20:59] be a with the Shu the kingdom of God
[1:21:01] which is in the Earth today can never be
[1:21:02] set up just on a permissive will it's
[1:21:06] got to come back to his perfect
[1:21:09] will
[1:21:10] eventually the kingdom of God working in
[1:21:13] the permissive will come back to the
[1:21:14] perfect he said but if the people won't
[1:21:16] walk in his perfect one the seron does
[1:21:18] God ever change his mind he does have a
[1:21:20] permissive will he'll let you walk in he
[1:21:22] permits it all right but he'll make it
[1:21:23] work out for his glory in his perfect
[1:21:26] will what happened with
[1:21:28] Moses he didn't step into that perfect
[1:21:32] will I think that's a different
[1:21:33] statement there Moses didn't step into
[1:21:35] that perfect
[1:21:36] will here he is at the doorstep of the
[1:21:39] entrance and he had an opportunity to
[1:21:41] speak to the Rock and because he doesn't
[1:21:44] what does God say because you didn't
[1:21:46] speak to the Rock I'm not going to allow
[1:21:48] you to cross over Jordan
[1:21:51] alive look at the image then think of
[1:21:54] the point that we come to that brother
[1:21:56] the perfect Faith the word operate in
[1:21:58] human flesh by physical signs material
[1:22:00] Signs by scriptural signs to bring you
[1:22:01] to a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture
[1:22:04] it's got to come to a point where you
[1:22:06] let everything all the momentum of the
[1:22:08] Divine Promises of God God genuinely
[1:22:11] manifest himself in signs and wonders
[1:22:14] Miracles not s back well the devil's
[1:22:15] doing that the devil's doing that no
[1:22:16] believe in God take as word comes to
[1:22:19] point speak and go forward speak and
[1:22:21] possess the land speak and translate
[1:22:25] bring you to a perfect faith and does
[1:22:27] God ever change his mind about his word
[1:22:28] here's that statement bam had a gift of
[1:22:30] faith musicians you could come that way
[1:22:32] we're creating this creating the
[1:22:33] expectation for a close balam had a gift
[1:22:36] of faith and could have used it to the
[1:22:38] perfect original word of
[1:22:41] God many men on the field today with
[1:22:43] gifts of healing could do the same thing
[1:22:45] many men out here people speaking in
[1:22:47] tongues people prophesying a gift could
[1:22:50] use it for the kingdom of God but they
[1:22:51] don't do
[1:22:53] it and God blesses them anyhow gets the
[1:22:57] permissive
[1:22:59] will and here's kind of the edge but for
[1:23:01] popularity and pleasures and personal
[1:23:03] gains sold their birth rights as Esau
[1:23:04] did sold out to an organization sold out
[1:23:07] like
[1:23:09] balum is that what Paul was talking
[1:23:11] about I am a
[1:23:12] sephus I'm of
[1:23:14] apollis where people sell out their
[1:23:17] Birthright for
[1:23:19] popularity for pretense for personality
[1:23:25] and so
[1:23:26] Moses had an opportunity to demonstrate
[1:23:30] the maturing of the word over a 40-year
[1:23:32] period at the doorstep of an entrance
[1:23:35] into the promised land a placing a
[1:23:37] positional placing to speak the word and
[1:23:41] water would
[1:23:42] come that was a critical moment where
[1:23:45] instead of following God's perfect will
[1:23:46] his very actions testified of the
[1:23:50] insufficiency is that is that enough to
[1:23:52] really think about yeah is that enough
[1:23:56] to ask ourselves well then Lord how is
[1:23:59] it all working together Lord I don't
[1:24:01] ever want my faith to testify of the
[1:24:04] insufficiency of your word but thank God
[1:24:08] he knows when our faith is insufficient
[1:24:10] not the word but our faith and he'll
[1:24:12] demonstrate to us as is necessary for
[1:24:14] our faith to grow but Lord don't ever
[1:24:16] let me come to a place where the word
[1:24:18] isn't
[1:24:20] enough in the sermon why brother B said
[1:24:23] there's where Moses made a sin by
[1:24:24] striking the rock the second time
[1:24:28] instead of speaking to it he smote it
[1:24:31] the first
[1:24:32] time what did it speak of the second
[1:24:35] time what did it speak
[1:24:37] of the weakness of the blood of Jesus
[1:24:39] that he had have to be smitten for each
[1:24:43] individual that's what he testified it
[1:24:46] was a weakness it wasn't perfect
[1:24:50] Faith yeah I maybe there's just a lot
[1:24:53] more that well say next
[1:24:56] time it wasn't it wasn't repeating what
[1:24:59] he did in the beginning like now that's
[1:25:01] it that's where this all ends up that's
[1:25:04] what we come to is doing what we did in
[1:25:06] the beginning but no what he did in the
[1:25:08] beginning is with them there at the end
[1:25:11] the rod is still with them the evidence
[1:25:14] is still fresh the manifestation is a
[1:25:16] part of the testimony he stands there
[1:25:18] with the image not dis not not taking
[1:25:21] the rod and breaking it and saying
[1:25:22] there's nothing to it but it was there
[1:25:24] with him in the presence why as
[1:25:26] Vindication that in this moment the same
[1:25:29] God that could let RO water come from a
[1:25:31] rock when I smoted it is the same God
[1:25:33] that's going to back up my word and
[1:25:36] bring forth water from the Rock and what
[1:25:39] that would bring forth from the hearts
[1:25:41] of the people is to believe if God could
[1:25:43] do that by his word to the Rock what can
[1:25:46] his word do for
[1:25:48] me there would have been a greater trust
[1:25:51] a greater confidence a greater faith
[1:25:55] but when he struck it it spoke to the
[1:25:56] weakness of the blood he said Christ was
[1:25:59] smitten for our healing we just speak to
[1:26:02] the Rock now and it brings forth its
[1:26:06] healing but you see we've been taught
[1:26:08] wrong in all this here laying on of
[1:26:10] hands and
[1:26:12] Sensations so is it wrong to lay hands
[1:26:15] no Ian unless you're talking about these
[1:26:16] hands
[1:26:18] right is it is it wrong to lay hands on
[1:26:21] the sick absolutely not
[1:26:25] brother Brandon I think he says in one
[1:26:26] place I'm not one of these altar call
[1:26:28] preachers but he's not one of these
[1:26:29] preachers that's preaching an altar call
[1:26:31] is
[1:26:32] evil he's not preaching that laying
[1:26:34] hands on the sick is evil he's just
[1:26:37] saying there's a Miss there's an
[1:26:38] emphasis these are my words that there's
[1:26:40] a particular emphasis that gets the
[1:26:43] picture away from Christ in more on the
[1:26:46] the mechanics of
[1:26:48] things CU he says now we can speak to
[1:26:51] the Rock and bring forth healing we've
[1:26:53] been taught all this here laying on
[1:26:54] hands and Sensations don't ever build
[1:26:57] your hopes of Salvation upon a sensation
[1:27:00] cuz you can have all kinds of sensation
[1:27:02] but build it upon the word of God that
[1:27:05] is where you can beat Satan anytime upon
[1:27:07] the word it's thus saith the
[1:27:12] Lord we are taught that the word of God
[1:27:15] can defeat Satan anytime anywhere any
[1:27:18] place you say well where's the platform
[1:27:20] where's the tunnel of ministers where's
[1:27:22] the Saturday night where's the music
[1:27:24] music just right don't need any of that
[1:27:26] the word of God can defeat Satan anytime
[1:27:29] anywhere any place and so what are all
[1:27:33] these instances of the demonstrations
[1:27:36] and the manifestations of the power of
[1:27:38] God to do to cause you to trust him more
[1:27:41] he met me at an altar he met me in a
[1:27:43] prayer line that's a bonafied
[1:27:45] manifestation of the power of God and it
[1:27:48] gives me confidence to believe the same
[1:27:50] God who said you can lay hands on the
[1:27:52] sick and you shall recover is the same
[1:27:53] God that said by his stripes I am healed
[1:27:57] and now with my own mouth I can speak to
[1:28:00] the
[1:28:02] Rock now I can speak to the rock for my
[1:28:06] healing what a
[1:28:08] demonstration what a what a what a
[1:28:10] product of all the momentum of what God
