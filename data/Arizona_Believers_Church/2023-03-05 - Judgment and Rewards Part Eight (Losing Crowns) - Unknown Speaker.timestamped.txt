[0:00] We are continuing on the subject of
[0:01] judgment and rewards. This is our eighth
[0:03] service on the subject. And today on the
[0:06] title of losing crowns, if you could
[0:09] just look with me on this verse 26, I
[0:13] want to do this at the outset and then
[0:15] I'm going to back up and go over a few
[0:16] things from last Sunday and Wednesday or
[0:19] maybe more from Wednesday. But notice it
[0:21] says,"For I say unto you that unto
[0:23] everyone which hath shall be given, and
[0:25] from him that hath not, even that he
[0:27] hath shall be taken away from him." And
[0:30] it's kind of hearkening back to verse
[0:32] 24. Take from him the pound. And the one
[0:34] that had the one pound and give it to
[0:36] him that hath 10 pounds. And there's a
[0:38] kind of an objection to this. And it's
[0:42] everyone that hath gained shall be
[0:44] given, and from him who hath not gained
[0:47] shall be taken away. And so it's not
[0:49] just he that hath because it's it's the
[0:51] gain that is being looked at. Take from
[0:53] him uh which hath not gained. Take what
[0:56] was given to him and give it to the one
[0:58] who has gained. So what I want you to
[1:00] recognize as Christ tells this parable
[1:02] and we amplified it to a much greater
[1:04] degree last Sunday. We'll revisit it
[1:06] towards the end of the service today
[1:08] that the um servant, this one who was
[1:10] given the pound and did nothing with it
[1:13] had something taken away from him. So,
[1:15] kind of the idea that I want you to
[1:17] consider is that he loses something. Uh,
[1:19] this is something that was entrusted to
[1:20] him that's taken away and now there's
[1:23] this moment when they appear before the
[1:24] master and he's going to make him give
[1:26] an account of what they've done with
[1:27] what they were given. And so, here's
[1:29] different ones holding different
[1:31] measures and there's a reward for this
[1:32] one, there's a reward for this one. And
[1:33] then he gets to this one who only has
[1:35] what he's been given. There's nothing
[1:37] been gained and he says, "You're losing
[1:39] something and it's going to be given to
[1:41] someone else." And that's kind of a
[1:43] striking image. uh that is presented to
[1:46] us. And so that's where I I I'm using
[1:48] this thought under judgment and rewards,
[1:51] losing crowns because we can equate
[1:53] rewards to crowns and how there's
[1:55] something to be lost. Now, if you could
[1:57] turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians
[1:59] chapter 3, I'd like to read through
[2:01] these verses again. I can't remember
[2:03] which service we use these in,
[2:06] but I'd like to bring them up before you
[2:07] again here quickly.
[2:09] says, "Now if any man build upon this
[2:11] foundation, the foundation is Jesus
[2:13] Christ individually. It's our own
[2:15] experience in Christ which is laid by
[2:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now if
[2:18] any man build upon this foundation,
[2:20] gold, silver, precious stones, wood,
[2:24] hay, stubble, every man's work shall be
[2:26] made manifest for the day shall declare
[2:28] it." We could refer to the judgment seat
[2:31] of Christ in this because it shall be
[2:32] revealed by fire and the fire shall try
[2:35] every man's work of what sort it is. We
[2:37] know that every man will have to stand
[2:39] before God and the bride themselves will
[2:41] also stand uh to answer for their work.
[2:44] And then it says if any man's work abide
[2:47] which he hath built there upon he shall
[2:50] receive a reward. That would be the
[2:52] gold, the silver, the precious stones
[2:53] built upon the foundation. So if his
[2:56] work remains, there's gain to him. It
[2:58] survives. And then he's going to receive
[3:00] a reward for that. But then the opposite
[3:03] is if any man's work shall be burned,
[3:05] that wood, hay, and stubble, consumed by
[3:08] the fire, examined in the light of God's
[3:10] word, if that doesn't survive, he says
[3:12] he shall suffer loss. And I know that
[3:14] seems kind of staggering because you
[3:16] think, "Oh, you mean someone can stand
[3:17] there and have the foundation of Jesus
[3:19] Christ and then stand before the the
[3:21] judgment seat of Christ and then if he
[3:23] has not built upon it and it's wood,
[3:25] hay, and stubble and it gets burned up,
[3:27] he's going to lose his salvation." He
[3:28] says, "No, he shall suffer loss, but he
[3:30] himself shall be saved, yet so as by
[3:33] fire." And so, there's something to be
[3:35] said about purification and weaning out
[3:37] and tearing away anything that doesn't
[3:39] reflect the glory of Christ. And
[3:41] anything that you added to that was
[3:42] wood, hay, and stubble, your own
[3:44] opinions, your own selfish works,
[3:46] whatever it may be, that's not going to
[3:48] remain. So, thankfully, the only thing
[3:50] that would remain is anything that
[3:52] merits a reward. So, therefore, there's
[3:54] no need to punish, right? But there's
[3:56] still a loss that's implied here. So it
[3:58] shall suffer a loss. It's translated
[4:00] that very word is translated in Luke
[4:02] when Jesus is speaking to be cast away.
[4:04] So there's there's some sense of loss or
[4:06] something being restrained. And what we
[4:09] I think we touched on before that when
[4:11] you shall suffer loss in the context,
[4:14] there's going to forfeit a special
[4:16] reward. There's going to be something uh
[4:18] that they when it says they shall suffer
[4:20] loss, it's a the loss of some peculiar
[4:22] degree of honor, the loss of some degree
[4:24] of praise. had you done a job well done,
[4:26] there would have been like you did a
[4:28] great job, right? And so it's kind of
[4:30] like uh when somebody
[4:33] my grandpa taught me this years ago, and
[4:34] you could write this down if you want to
[4:36] use it. He taught me this years ago that
[4:37] if anyone if a woman ever shows you her
[4:40] engagement ring, look at it and say,
[4:42] "hm, nice setting." And uh and and it's
[4:45] supposed to kind of like just be one of
[4:46] those non-compliments, right? It's like
[4:50] nice setting. Like what about the size
[4:52] of the diamond or what about the
[4:53] clarity? you just say, "Oh, nice
[4:55] setting." And it's like, in other words,
[4:57] you just didn't really have anything
[4:58] good to say. And so, probably don't say
[5:00] anything at all. Right? Because now, you
[5:02] know, sister engaged and she shows me,
[5:04] you know, I don't think I said that to
[5:06] sister Maddie, so I think I'm in the
[5:07] clear. Um, you know, there's something
[5:10] about withholding praise. Like, I'm not
[5:12] going to say anything. And then God also
[5:14] is going to praise. There's a praise.
[5:16] There's a degree of honor and glory and
[5:18] praise that is given to the individual.
[5:19] And that's different than saying, "Good
[5:21] job. Enter into the go the the joy of
[5:23] thy Lord." And and job well done. Enter
[5:25] into the joy of thy Lord. To where there
[5:26] could be more ausive praise where the
[5:28] Bible says here, "You shall receive a
[5:30] reward, but then there's something
[5:32] that's lost." And brother Brad makes
[5:34] this statement. I want you to key in on
[5:36] the title of this sermon, hear ye him.
[5:38] And I believe it's in this sermon here
[5:40] ye Him that uh or that that title I
[5:44] can't remember now if he preached that
[5:46] one more than uh Jesus Christ the same
[5:48] yesterday today and forever but here ye
[5:50] him is one of those sermons he preached
[5:51] extensively was even noticing where he
[5:54] preached the same exact sermon in
[5:55] Phoenix like two years apart so it was
[5:57] something that uh he just he was feeling
[6:00] led and impressed to continue to preach
[6:02] on a regular basis across the country
[6:04] and in that sermon here you him he says
[6:06] in Christian you're going to be
[6:08] responsible before before God, after
[6:10] you've accepted Christ as your savior
[6:12] for your life,
[6:14] God is going to hold you accountable. So
[6:18] think about that how he says that after
[6:20] you are saved, after you've accepted
[6:23] Christ as your savior, after, if I could
[6:25] put it this way, after you've been
[6:25] filled with the Holy Ghost, God is going
[6:27] to hold you responsible for your life,
[6:29] for how you built what is built upon
[6:32] that foundation of salvation. And he
[6:33] says God is going to hold you
[6:35] accountable. Now, you'll find uh this
[6:38] morning as we go forward in this subject
[6:41] that these concepts um are going to be
[6:43] very familiar to you if you've been
[6:45] following us through these last several
[6:46] services. And the concepts are building
[6:49] from service to service. All the
[6:51] scriptures, all the quotations, pulling
[6:53] from different places in the Bible and
[6:55] the message of the hour, they're all
[6:57] they're all kind of uh connecting
[6:59] together. They're all tying in. And we
[7:01] don't have time uh to go back to part
[7:03] one and tie it in or part two and tie it
[7:05] in. But you'll find there's a lot of
[7:06] same scriptures being used, but I I want
[7:08] you to see how they're just being woven
[7:10] together even more tightly. And and I'd
[7:13] like to say this not to qualify it in
[7:16] any way, but each principle supports the
[7:18] other. And so, as we're speaking on the
[7:20] subject of judgment and rewards, I
[7:22] really believe that each one of these uh
[7:24] principles are best considered within
[7:26] the context of kind of the whole point.
[7:28] like there's this there's this general
[7:30] idea I'm wanting you guys to recognize
[7:32] about God rewarding you for faithful
[7:34] service and then all these other
[7:36] scriptures and quotations that we're
[7:37] using how they kind of tie in together
[7:40] to support um that subject this whole
[7:42] subject and so each one of these
[7:44] principles I believe kind of it benefits
[7:45] from the other as we look at this and
[7:49] and I say this to create positive
[7:51] anticipation but today uh we're going to
[7:54] approach a very difficult subject of
[7:55] adoption and the also with respect to
[7:58] that a hard to grasp aspect of losing
[8:01] rewards. And that's why we've titled it
[8:02] losing crowns. And I know even in some
[8:05] of the fellowship that I've had over the
[8:07] last few weeks that um this whole idea
[8:10] of standing before the judgment seat of
[8:11] Christ and having in any sense of shame
[8:14] or loss is difficult to grasp and we
[8:16] don't necessarily need to understand it
[8:18] completely, try to figure it all out in
[8:20] its types and its allegorories and how
[8:22] it'll unfold. But we can certainly see
[8:24] that there is some loss that is suffered
[8:27] as the Bible refers to it. We'll kind of
[8:29] touch on it more today. And with respect
[8:32] to the subject of adoption and maybe
[8:34] it's more so to the losing rewards, how
[8:36] maybe it's a little ambiguous and not
[8:38] clear, but there's a lot of confusion uh
[8:40] a lot of unnecessary complications and
[8:42] maybe even paradoxes um that can be
[8:44] resolved. I believe that can be resolved
[8:47] by understanding the concept of rewards.
[8:51] A paradox in the word of God. I believe
[8:52] any paradox that is a godly paradox uh
[8:56] that brother Bram says is kind of it's
[8:57] doesn't seem true but it's true or hard
[8:59] to believe it's diff impossible but it's
[9:01] true they're going to be resolved to be
[9:04] true at some point
[9:05] like there's no uh false paradoxes in
[9:08] the word of God and so I believe that
[9:10] there's some of these paradoxes we see
[9:12] with some teachings that could when you
[9:14] see the concept of rewards and judgment
[9:16] for future rewards and you see it off in
[9:18] the future it can just make something
[9:20] turn just enough to say oh well I get
[9:22] did it. That makes sense. I see that
[9:24] that that gives the proper weight to
[9:26] these things that brother Brandham said
[9:27] or it gives a greater understanding of
[9:29] what the scriptures are driving at. And
[9:31] so, as you've done so already in this
[9:33] laborious intro, I I I want to encourage
[9:36] you uh to give this service your
[9:38] undivided attention. And we're not
[9:40] asking for a lot of time uh today. Uh
[9:43] even though we may take a lot of time,
[9:45] we're not asking for it. Uh we don't
[9:47] hope to uh belabor anything, but I
[9:50] believe today we're covering very
[9:51] important ground that as things have
[9:53] been building and maybe you're putting
[9:54] pieces in different places, you're like,
[9:56] "Wow, I just want to see the picture
[9:57] come together." I believe today is just
[10:00] one more uh something laid on top of
[10:02] this to really encourage us to a greater
[10:05] level and help us with this subject.
[10:08] Now, so if you could just uh be very
[10:09] focused, I would even encourage uh some
[10:12] of our young people and the children
[10:14] that kind of sit up at the front. Let's
[10:15] not be in the habit of getting up and
[10:17] leaving frequently. Um, you'll have a
[10:19] chance when you're dismissed uh to take
[10:21] care of certain matters. I tell you
[10:23] what, if I go on a bathroom break, you
[10:25] can. Does that work? Deal. Now, re just
[10:30] to review real quick on Wednesday night
[10:31] on character development. Uh, we took
[10:34] character development and saw how it's
[10:35] connected to our eternal rewards that we
[10:37] receive in heaven. And so, at the
[10:39] judgment seat of Christ, we will receive
[10:42] crowns. That's a reward of glory, a
[10:44] reward of honor, a reward of reward of
[10:45] praise. We saw that last Sunday. And
[10:48] it's based upon how we labored in Christ
[10:50] while we're here on earth. And that's uh
[10:52] somewhat reflective of our character.
[10:54] What did we do with God? What God gave
[10:56] us. And we see this theme that
[10:58] character, your character is going to
[11:00] determine what you do with what you're
[11:01] given. And since it's your character
[11:04] that's demonstrated uh in your conduct,
[11:07] God then wants to develop character uh
[11:09] as you conduct yourself. And as we're
[11:11] looking at those themes, brother Bram
[11:13] says God's will for us is perfection.
[11:15] That and that perfection is patience,
[11:17] waiting on God and waiting for God. He
[11:19] says this is the process of character
[11:22] development.
[11:25] And this character development, this
[11:27] process of character development, we
[11:29] notice that there was a direct
[11:31] connection between our character, which
[11:33] can be our conduct, our attitude, things
[11:34] we say or do, and our reward. A direct
[11:37] connection between our character and our
[11:39] crowns. And so these are just review
[11:41] points from Wednesday. So as we conduct
[11:43] ourselves in life, we could even
[11:45] generalize it this way that what you do
[11:47] is either going to merit correction or
[11:49] it merits a reward. If I do something
[11:51] wrong as a child of God, I can expect to
[11:53] be corrected. If I do something right,
[11:56] um there is a there is a reward that is
[11:58] promised. I know that's oversimplistic
[11:59] maybe in some ways, but our conduct and
[12:02] our character is either fitting for
[12:03] reward or it's fitting for correction.
[12:06] And God corrects us because as brother
[12:08] Bradom said, his will for us is
[12:11] perfection. He wants us to come to
[12:13] perfection. God does not want you to
[12:15] fall short of any promise. God wants us
[12:17] to come to perfection. And and and so in
[12:20] this idea of perfection, I wanted to
[12:22] touch on Hebrews chapter 5 really quick
[12:25] because this perfection that God wants
[12:26] for you is not sinlessness,
[12:29] but it has to do with our character.
[12:31] Because if what God required of you was
[12:33] perfection and that you had never
[12:35] sinned, guess what? Not going to do it,
[12:38] right? It's too late. I I I was born I
[12:42] was born the wrong way. I I I I I sinned
[12:45] throughout my life and and there's
[12:48] there's just mistakes that were made. So
[12:50] when it comes to the kind of sinless
[12:51] perfection that sometimes we think
[12:52] about, it's too late for that. And in
[12:54] Hebrews 5:es 8 and 9, it says, "Though
[12:57] he were a son," speaking of Jesus
[12:58] Christ, "Yet learned he obedience by the
[13:01] things which he suffered." Quite a quite
[13:03] a staggering statement. Brother Abraham
[13:05] says, "In plain language, the very
[13:06] character of Jesus was perfected through
[13:08] suffering. And he has left a measuring
[13:10] of suffering measure of suffering for us
[13:13] that we in suffering according to the
[13:14] will of God might be brought to a place
[13:15] of perfection." He says, "And being made
[13:17] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[13:19] salvation unto all them that obey him."
[13:22] So when it says he learned obedience, it
[13:25] speaks of an increase of one's knowledge
[13:27] by practice to be informed. So the Bible
[13:29] says he increased in wisdom and in
[13:31] stature and in favor with God and man.
[13:33] This is something that built up
[13:35] something that increased. And it's
[13:36] saying here that he learned by obedience
[13:39] and by learning by obedience with the
[13:41] thing through the things which he
[13:42] suffered. He was made perfect. That
[13:44] means to carry through completely to
[13:46] accomplish something means to finish or
[13:48] bring to an end. So it says being made
[13:51] perfect. He was made complete. He was
[13:53] brought to an end. He finished his work.
[13:55] And so looking at this, I believe very
[13:58] quickly if we just look at it and
[14:00] consider what's being expressed by Paul,
[14:02] perfection is not sinlessness
[14:04] because Christ knew no sin. He committed
[14:07] no sin. He was not born in sin. He
[14:10] completely avoided any stain of sin in
[14:13] that regards. And so having lived a
[14:16] sinless life by action in thought and
[14:19] action in deed, it was not sinlessness
[14:22] that's c is the subject of being made
[14:24] perfect. But he became and was brought
[14:26] to completion. He although he was
[14:29] sinless, he could still become perfect.
[14:32] So our perfection isn't to try to go
[14:35] back and erase our history and to
[14:37] somehow lead a perfect life, but our
[14:40] perfection is going to be ultimately
[14:42] brought to a finish, brought to a
[14:45] completion. And so his character was
[14:47] made perfect.
[14:49] Something about his mission, his
[14:50] purpose, and who he was, and his his
[14:52] duty to express it was a perfect
[14:55] expression. And a lot of this I could
[14:58] say can go down the channel of having
[15:00] the right kind of heart.
[15:02] And so the Bible says although he were
[15:04] though he were a son as we're kind of
[15:06] breaking these parts down. Although he
[15:07] was a son uh he learned obedience by the
[15:10] things which he suffered. Though he was
[15:11] the son of God, he is now in the
[15:13] similitude of sons of men and a son of
[15:16] man in that he learned obedience by the
[15:19] things which he suffered. And Paul uses
[15:21] a language that that draws into view the
[15:23] process of maturity. It draws into the
[15:26] view the idea of a son being born into
[15:27] the family and him not just being given
[15:30] everything fed to him and and and just
[15:32] everything coming easy, but he has to go
[15:35] through the process of character
[15:37] development.
[15:38] And though we he were a son, he he he
[15:41] became perfect through obedience or he
[15:43] learned obedience by the things which he
[15:44] suffered and was brought to completion
[15:46] and perfection. It's that it's the idea
[15:49] of character development and it brings
[15:52] into view and I and I hope you can focus
[15:55] if I'm stumbling in my thoughts and my
[15:57] words. It it'll be up to your your
[16:00] perseverance this morning to want to
[16:02] hear from God to to work through
[16:05] whatever whatever part is getting in the
[16:07] way here to hear what God wants you to
[16:09] hear because he says though he were a
[16:11] son and the language he's using ought to
[16:13] us we ought to consider the role of the
[16:16] father in bringing his son to perfection
[16:20] that that God had looked out over had
[16:23] committed him to earthly parents had
[16:25] dealt with his heart and led him and
[16:27] guide him and showed showed him what to
[16:28] do and told him what to say. And so the
[16:30] father then has this role in developing
[16:34] Christ. This the role of the father's
[16:36] correction, the role of the father's
[16:37] instruction. This is what is it's it's
[16:40] viewed in in this statement of though he
[16:43] were a son.
[16:45] And on in Hebrews 12:7
[16:51] now he's speaking to us. If ye endure
[16:54] chastening,
[16:56] God dealeth with you as with sons.
[16:59] For what son is he whom the father
[17:01] chastineth not? So we we must look at
[17:04] ourselves through the the image and type
[17:08] or even if I could say the truth and
[17:10] reality that we are children of God. And
[17:14] being children of God, we are we can
[17:16] draw from the natural examples in life
[17:19] of how that a mother and father had the
[17:21] responsibility of raising and rearing
[17:24] their child up in the way that they
[17:25] ought to go a and and and giving them a
[17:28] law of the mother and the the the rule
[17:30] of the father. And there's things that
[17:31] ought to be impressed upon them. And so
[17:34] whatever those dynamics are in their
[17:36] purity and their right form, he's saying
[17:38] that we God deals with us as sons. A son
[17:42] to a Hebrew is a builder of the family
[17:44] name, the one that stands uh to come
[17:47] into the perfect image of the father.
[17:49] And so God deals with you as with sons.
[17:52] And brother Rand takes these words
[17:54] chastening and rebuke and even from
[17:56] Revelation, as many as I love, I rebuke
[17:58] and chasen and drawing from the
[18:00] proverbs. To rebuke is to reprove. To
[18:03] reprove is to expose with the view to
[18:06] correction. So if you expose with the
[18:09] view to laugh, if you expose with a view
[18:11] to mock, if you expose with a view to
[18:13] put down, if you expose with a view to
[18:15] make yourself look better, wrong idea.
[18:18] But God will only expose something
[18:20] because he wants to address something
[18:22] and he wants to correct something. Cha
[18:25] chasen does not mean to punish. So our
[18:27] rebuke and our chastening is not
[18:29] punitive. It's not just to make us look
[18:31] shameful, but it means to discipline
[18:33] because the subject's amendment is in
[18:36] mind. Your improvement is God's purpose.
[18:39] When he rebukes you, your improvement
[18:42] and your correcting your behavior so
[18:44] that you can improve is God's goal and
[18:46] objective when he uh when he disciplines
[18:49] you. He wants you to be better by it,
[18:52] not worse.
[18:54] And so these are important principles
[18:56] carried over from character development.
[18:58] And so we can recognize by scripture
[19:00] that we are sons and daughters of God.
[19:03] That having been born again by his
[19:04] spirit, it puts us in line and in
[19:06] relationship as children of God. And the
[19:09] Bible then uses this language in a lot
[19:12] of different places to support that. And
[19:14] as children, we stand in line to receive
[19:17] an inheritance.
[19:18] And in Romans 8:1 17 it says, "And if
[19:21] children, then heirs." An heir is one
[19:23] who inherits or has the right of
[19:25] inheritance in the property of another.
[19:27] An heir is someone who has either
[19:28] inherited or stands to receive the
[19:32] property of someone else. I know there's
[19:33] a lot maybe legally that goes into that
[19:35] and a lot assumed in it. An heir even in
[19:37] the New Testament is used of one who has
[19:39] acquired or obtained a portion that is
[19:42] allotted to him. It speaks of an heir
[19:44] gets an inheritance. That's what is
[19:46] thought here. And of children, then
[19:48] heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with
[19:51] Christ. So we stand to receive an
[19:53] inheritance jointly with Christ. that
[19:56] ought to bring a pretty vast inheritance
[19:58] into view.
[19:59] Then he offers this qualifying language.
[20:01] If so be that we suffer with him, that
[20:03] we may also be glorified,
[20:05] we may be also glorified together.
[20:09] This is the process of character
[20:10] development. That if you stand to be an
[20:13] heir, just as a father would take
[20:14] interest in his son and God dealeth with
[20:17] you as sons and he chasens and he
[20:19] reproves and he disciplines and he
[20:20] rebukes not just to shame you but to
[20:23] correct you and to improve you. Why?
[20:25] Because you are an heir.
[20:27] And he takes interest in what he stands
[20:30] to give you. And he realizes this is my
[20:32] opportunity to train them in order to
[20:35] receive what I'm going to give them.
[20:39] Are you with me?
[20:41] All right. It it just it feels wonderful
[20:42] up here. So, I hope you feel at least
[20:44] half as good as I do. And I know we're
[20:46] feeling awesome.
[20:48] in Galatians chapter 4 and I think this
[20:50] is a logical place to go now
[20:54] this I'm going to I want to be very very
[20:56] careful in these parts here
[21:00] um because these are very significant
[21:05] scriptures Galatians chapter 4 we'll
[21:07] read to verse 7 I may have misnumbered
[21:10] the slides there on the the first one
[21:12] but Galatians 4:es 1-7 it says now I say
[21:16] that The heir, we're going to go to
[21:17] verse seven. Now, I say that the heir,
[21:20] as long as he is a child, differth
[21:22] nothing from a servant, though he be
[21:24] lord of all. So, this heir is appointed
[21:27] by the father to receive an inheritance.
[21:29] So, the heir is one who stands uh to
[21:32] inherit or has the right of inheritance
[21:34] in the property of another. So, an heir
[21:37] and it refers to one who's going to
[21:38] inherit something. He says as long as he
[21:40] is a child differth nothing from a
[21:42] servant. So, a child is one who's
[21:44] unskilled or untaught, someone who's
[21:46] underage. So, Paul is he's referring to
[21:48] things just so matter of fact that you
[21:50] have to assume that the Galatians knew
[21:53] what he was talking about, right? That
[21:55] he's using a language that they must
[21:56] have been like, "Hey, good point, Paul.
[21:58] Hadn't thought about that." And we're
[22:00] over there going, "Wait a minute, wait a
[22:01] minute, wait, wait, more, more, one
[22:02] more. Kind of get Can you give me more?"
[22:03] Uh, but he's just kind of giving them,
[22:05] you know, you've been taught this, you
[22:07] understand this. Just kind of refers.
[22:09] There's a lot of rich tradition within
[22:11] uh Rome, the Roman hierarchy. There's a
[22:14] lot of things in the Old Testament or
[22:15] just amongst the Jews. Um a lot of laws
[22:18] and rules that govern these things. So I
[22:20] think there was just something they
[22:21] thought of that this heir, this one who
[22:24] stood to receive the father's
[22:25] inheritance, as long as he's underage or
[22:28] unskilled or untaught because there was
[22:31] law, the Roman law and even um Jewish
[22:33] laws that determined that at this age
[22:36] you stand to receive the inheritance.
[22:38] But if you're not mature enough, it's
[22:40] going to go to this age. And if you're
[22:42] not mature enough, it's going to go to
[22:43] this age. Even to one place I found
[22:44] where it could go all the way up to
[22:45] where you're 35
[22:47] before you could receive things. And
[22:48] even as young as 13. And so there was
[22:51] some sort of it wasn't just, oh, guess
[22:53] what? You turned 13, Preston. You get
[22:55] everything. But it was like, hey, you
[22:57] know, if you're not ready yet, then
[22:58] there's things that you can't enjoy and
[23:00] privileges you can't uh uh receive. You
[23:02] all are pulling so well. I feel awesome
[23:05] because these are things that you just
[23:06] don't know how much you can share in
[23:07] this. and you're just pulling it out. So
[23:09] now he says that he differs nothing from
[23:12] a servant.
[23:14] He doesn't have the full liberty to use
[23:16] and to enjoy his inheritance.
[23:19] So the father the heir then is somewhat
[23:22] an heir has to be associated with an
[23:24] inheritance. So there's some uh uh
[23:29] there's something there that is seen and
[23:31] observed and say, "Wow, this is this
[23:34] this is mine or this is going to be
[23:37] mine." But he's no different than a
[23:39] servant because he can't fully enjoy and
[23:41] use this just like servants can't
[23:45] because the Bible says though he be lord
[23:47] of all, though he be an owner by title
[23:49] and right, but he's not in full
[23:51] possession. Right?
[23:53] Technically, it's his. And and he stands
[23:55] to receive it. And in some ways, it's
[23:57] like, "Son, this is yours. Son, this is
[23:59] yours. Son, this is yours." But he
[24:01] cannot fully enjoy it and be in full
[24:03] possession of it and have ownership of
[24:05] it because he's either underage or the
[24:07] idea would be more maturity. He's not
[24:08] skilled or taught. So Paul brings that
[24:11] image up in our minds. He says, "But
[24:13] verse two is under the t under tutors
[24:15] and governors until the time appointed
[24:18] of the father." So these are governors
[24:20] of the person.
[24:22] There's a tutor that governs the person,
[24:23] his character, his thoughts, his his his
[24:26] mannerisms. I I'm I'm raising up the
[24:28] person. And then there's also governors.
[24:29] It kind of refers to even a different
[24:31] aspect. These would be stewards of the
[24:33] inheritance. Right.
[24:35] And so you have one who's training the
[24:37] child, one that's over looking over
[24:39] looking out after the estate or the
[24:41] inheritance until the time appointed of
[24:43] the father until the inheritance can be
[24:46] fully formally, if I can say that way,
[24:48] possessed or another way that brother
[24:50] Brennan refers to it, legally possessed,
[24:52] legal possession. So God, Paul is
[24:55] referring to this process both in Roman
[24:57] law and Jewish law and other laws to
[24:59] where a son may be an heir to everything
[25:01] the father had. But wisdom dictated
[25:04] don't just give it to him.
[25:06] Put it in trust and have someone train
[25:09] the child and have someone even if
[25:12] necessary manage his estate until he's
[25:14] old enough to take over it
[25:17] until a time appointed of the father.
[25:19] And that time appointed the father is is
[25:21] something within the discretion of the
[25:23] father.
[25:25] Man, this is good.
[25:27] I'm I'm talking about the scripture, not
[25:28] the water. This is just just this is
[25:30] just Walmart, you know. Give me a
[25:32] squiggly. Uh those who worked at Walmart
[25:35] know what I'm talking about. Verse
[25:37] three, even so we when we were children,
[25:41] verse three, we were in bondage under
[25:42] the elements of the world. So now he's
[25:43] wanting it wanting them to consider this
[25:46] Roman law. this uh estate law and these
[25:50] different things that related to it,
[25:51] laws of inheritance. He wants us now to
[25:54] begin to think about it, the Jews to
[25:55] think about the Galatian believers who
[25:57] were Jews to think about it. Even so, we
[25:59] when we were children were in bondage
[26:01] under the elements of the world. But
[26:03] when the fullness of time was come, the
[26:06] time appointed of the father, God sent
[26:08] forth his son. So now notice the
[26:09] parallel language he's using, made of a
[26:12] woman, made under the law. And and this
[26:15] isn't just verse one of his letter. You
[26:17] can catch the whole read the whole book
[26:18] of Galatians. It's not hard to read.
[26:20] He's drawing from so much for them to
[26:22] consider what their what the rebuke is
[26:25] to them and how they ought to not mix
[26:27] Judaism with Christianity made under the
[26:31] law to redeem them that were under the
[26:34] law that we might receive the adoption
[26:38] of sons. There's a lot lot here that
[26:41] we've already covered so much. So the
[26:43] fullness of time we touched on this I
[26:45] think last year. This is the end of a
[26:46] dispensation. The fullness of time
[26:48] doesn't mean the end of time or the end
[26:50] of the world, but it was the end of the
[26:51] the the condition of the Jewish church
[26:54] state, the church state relationship
[26:55] there in Israel. And it was the end of
[26:57] that church state and the law. It was
[26:59] the end of the Jewish church ages. There
[27:01] was this dispensation where God would
[27:03] call a people by his name. He would give
[27:05] them a promised land. He would put them
[27:07] in that land and then he would raise up
[27:09] a seed of Abraham who would be the seed
[27:11] of Abraham and that would be Christ. And
[27:13] so this this is the time that the
[27:15] prophet spoke about. This was the time
[27:17] that God intended the law to reach, but
[27:19] the law would reach no further.
[27:21] So it was Paul is saying that we might
[27:23] receive the adoptions of sons. There was
[27:26] something that they were to do. But the
[27:27] Bible says in Romans that Christ is the
[27:29] end of the law for righteousness to
[27:31] everyone that believeth. That's the
[27:33] fullness of time Paul is talking about.
[27:34] He's the end of the law, the end of that
[27:36] dispensation.
[27:37] And so the Jews, this is I think it's
[27:39] important to consider what this meant to
[27:41] a Jew. Jews were trained under the law
[27:44] to be placed as witnesses of the Messiah
[27:47] when he came.
[27:48] Right?
[27:49] When you look at the Old Testament, God
[27:50] is raising up a people, trying to train
[27:52] them under prophets, train them under
[27:54] the law, so that when the Messiah would
[27:55] come, there'd be this nation that's
[27:57] already positionally placed in the
[27:59] promised land that would be witnesses of
[28:01] the Messiah.
[28:02] And Paul is looking is saying, that's
[28:04] why he says in Romans 9, to whom
[28:06] pertainth the adoption, there's an
[28:08] adoption for the Jews. There's an
[28:10] adoption for the Jewish church. Adoption
[28:12] for those Jews that were called under
[28:13] the wall that when Christ came that they
[28:15] are they were appointed to be witnesses
[28:18] of the Messiah were placed in the
[28:19] promised land with the Messiah. And they
[28:21] ought to have rejoiced and they ought to
[28:24] have announced this is the Messiah. But
[28:27] they didn't come to their placing.
[28:30] If I could say they missed their
[28:32] adoption
[28:34] and now
[28:36] but there are those who didn't. And so
[28:38] Paul is now looking at the Galatian Jews
[28:40] who have received Christ and he's
[28:43] challenged them not to go back into
[28:44] bondage again under the law, but to
[28:45] recognize that and this is important
[28:48] principle if you just want to kind of
[28:49] jot this down on the side. When the
[28:51] Messiah come, Christ came to call
[28:54] the Jews into a a a spiritual promised
[28:58] land. Right? There was that was an
[28:59] exodus. They had left Egypt to go to a
[29:02] natural land. Now Christ comes and now
[29:04] this entry into by Christ is a placing
[29:07] for them because that's the exodus. Now
[29:09] we have a different one now, right?
[29:11] We're in a different kind of Exodus. So
[29:13] it's important to recognize the
[29:14] difference of what adoption would mean
[29:16] to a Jew and what adoption would mean to
[29:17] a Gentile.
[29:19] And so to the Galatian Jews who had
[29:21] received the Holy Spirit, verse six
[29:23] says, "And because you are sons,
[29:26] God sent forth the spirit of his son
[29:28] into your hearts crying, Aba Father."
[29:30] Amen.
[29:32] Paul wants to maintain the symmetry of
[29:35] the image of how a son is an heir and is
[29:39] trained by the father to receive all
[29:40] that the father has. How that the Jews
[29:43] themselves were children under the law.
[29:45] And he's wanting to be claim this law,
[29:46] this law. But he's saying now you're not
[29:47] under the law, but God has sent his
[29:50] spirit into your hearts whereby you cry
[29:52] my father or father, father. Wherefore
[29:54] thou art no more a servant but a son. So
[29:57] you're no longer in bondage to the
[29:59] elements of this world. You're no longer
[30:00] just an earthly creature. You're not in
[30:02] bondage in bondage of the law. Christ is
[30:04] the end of the law, but now a son. And
[30:06] he reintroduces the principle, if a son,
[30:09] than an heir of God through Christ.
[30:13] I believe we can look at these
[30:14] scriptures and see that based upon what
[30:15] Paul is saying and how he transitions
[30:18] that from the adoption of the Jewish
[30:20] church, there emerges a pattern or type
[30:22] for the gentile bride, for the gentile
[30:24] dispensation rather, might be a better
[30:26] way of putting it. And Paul says, "Now
[30:28] he had sent the Holy Spirit into your
[30:29] heart, which the Holy Spirit we know is
[30:31] a tutor and a governor as brother
[30:32] Brandon placed it, who is going to train
[30:34] and to mature and to develop the Christ,
[30:36] the gentile church. That that's that's
[30:38] he's sending these gifts to men and he's
[30:40] nurturing and he's edifying." And so now
[30:43] we have the same image. You're not when
[30:44] you're born again, you're not born in
[30:46] the full stature. God trains you and
[30:48] raises you and develops you. And there's
[30:50] a process of character development in
[30:52] type. We can see that type of that thing
[30:55] happening in the church ages or to the
[30:56] church. So now, and I hope I'm being
[30:59] very succinct in the way that I'm saying
[31:01] this so that we don't let our minds
[31:02] necessarily wonder and try to figure
[31:04] everything out. But you know, if you can
[31:06] just find truth, you know that it fits
[31:09] with truth, right? You know that it's
[31:11] that truth has to fit with truth. Truth
[31:13] doesn't contradict truth.
[31:15] And so sometimes instead of to try just
[31:17] to eat the whole thing at once, you
[31:19] know, just eat what you've got. And and
[31:21] I can't see the forest for the trees.
[31:22] Well, you know, just enjoy the trees
[31:24] until you can see uh you can see the
[31:26] whole forest. And so in the pattern of
[31:29] the law of adoption in the Old
[31:30] Testament, there's a phrase, the law of
[31:31] adoption, which this this I may say it
[31:35] this way, the brother Brandham taught
[31:39] and often referred to the law of
[31:40] adoption. And Paul and he uses this
[31:43] scripture that this Holy Spirit that's
[31:45] been sent into the individual's life or
[31:46] the Holy Spirit that's been put into the
[31:48] church is a pattern of the law of
[31:50] adoption that Paul is referring to in
[31:52] Galatians 4 and even in pattern of what
[31:55] God did with the Jewish the Jewish
[31:57] nation and what they stood to receive
[31:59] and how they rejected it.
[32:02] Are you following me?
[32:05] Awesome.
[32:07] The law of adoption. I'm going to try to
[32:09] summarize this um without getting lost
[32:12] in the subject. Um there's there's so
[32:16] much in it, so many scriptures, so many
[32:18] things that could be uh drawn from it
[32:21] that uh you I could just we could just
[32:25] preach from on this just this aspect
[32:26] alone uh just without stopping. There's
[32:30] so much in it. But the law of adoption
[32:32] is essentially if I could summarize it
[32:34] this way and I want to be very strict in
[32:36] the way that I describe this. So I'm
[32:38] staying faithful the way brother
[32:39] Brandham taught it and the way the
[32:40] scriptures are alluding to it. A son is
[32:43] born in the family by natural birth.
[32:44] He's born into the family. And as a son
[32:47] in the family, he has all rights and
[32:48] privileges that a son would have in the
[32:50] family. But since the son stood or that
[32:53] son stood to become uh to uh he's an
[32:57] heir and he stood to be an heir to stood
[33:00] to receive his own legal possession of
[33:03] the estate or a portion of the estate or
[33:05] in some instances all that the father
[33:07] had. So a son is a son by birth and he's
[33:10] born into a family with all rights and
[33:11] privileges associated with that name and
[33:13] with the reputation of the family. um
[33:15] he's not a he's not a slave. He's not a
[33:17] servant. He he's not without privileges
[33:19] or rights or even authority because he's
[33:20] a son in the family. But in light of the
[33:23] fact that one day his father's name is
[33:26] essentially going to be his name is
[33:27] going to be the same as the father's
[33:28] name
[33:29] because he's the builder of the family
[33:31] name. And just as generations pass and
[33:32] another one takes over, his days coming.
[33:35] So he stood to receive as legal
[33:37] possession all that the father
[33:38] accumulates and gathers through his
[33:39] lifetime. And so the father knowing that
[33:42] he would take what he gained and pass it
[33:45] to his son just as his father took what
[33:47] he gained and pass it to him. The father
[33:49] would invest in training this child and
[33:51] developing this child a and take an
[33:54] interest out of love for this son so
[33:56] that he could be in a position to take
[33:58] over when the time was right.
[34:00] He wouldn't just say, "Well, I'm not
[34:02] going to have a thought about you till
[34:03] I'm gone." Or, "When I'm gone, I'm not
[34:04] going to have a thought about you. You
[34:05] just deal with it when I leave." he
[34:07] would take an interest in the one kind
[34:08] of brother Jack referred to how the the
[34:11] the lack of a succession plan isn't so
[34:14] much uh you know uh having a plan of
[34:17] succession but it's not loving enough to
[34:19] care for the one uh for what you are
[34:22] ruling over presently. You don't love it
[34:24] enough nor do you love the one who's
[34:26] going to take over enough to see that
[34:28] that you keep what you have and that the
[34:31] one who's going to receive what you've
[34:32] kept is in a position to even do better
[34:34] than you did.
[34:37] I think that's the real heart that a
[34:38] person should have.
[34:41] If the Lord should tar, I would that
[34:43] every single one of my sons far excel me
[34:46] in everything
[34:48] except gaining weight that that I I I
[34:51] hope Elliott is at least 6'3. Uh you
[34:54] know, I'd love it if Preston uh if God
[34:56] called him to the ministry and different
[34:58] and I I believe that they're I hope that
[35:00] they're way better than I ever was. That
[35:02] way I can say I raised him, right? And
[35:05] then somehow maybe I get the credit for
[35:06] it, right? Still selfish. No. Um, so the
[35:13] father would take an investment in this
[35:15] child. And so adoption, one thing to
[35:18] think about with adoption is there's
[35:19] kind of in a way we could just think
[35:21] adoption is like, well, you know, that's
[35:22] a very strict legal concept. It's
[35:26] different than so our adoption is what
[35:28] you take someone who is not your child
[35:30] wasn't born by you. You have no blood
[35:31] relation and you engage in a process
[35:33] that it that ends in adoption and that's
[35:36] when formally this child takes on your
[35:38] last name and becomes your own child and
[35:40] you become legal guardians of that
[35:42] child. That's not God's adoption at all.
[35:44] The child has already been born into the
[35:45] family. He's already a legal heir. He's
[35:47] already a legally a son. He's already
[35:49] illegally a son. Everything in there
[35:51] just fits. Adoption refers to a process
[35:54] and timing of the legal transfer of
[35:57] power or estate or ownership. The pro
[36:00] the process of passing over the the full
[36:03] inheritance. And so in practice it can
[36:06] be graduated. In practice it could this
[36:08] the timing could be much different based
[36:09] upon what we referred to before. Oh, I
[36:11] got it. I was 20. I'm still waiting for
[36:13] it and I'm 33. Right? There's just some
[36:16] things that change based upon the person
[36:17] and individual. But the adoption, we
[36:20] ought to think of a process that
[36:21] involves tutoring, training, uh uh um
[36:25] that brings a child to a place where
[36:27] even if it's scaled, they receive more
[36:29] and more authority and then ultimately
[36:31] full power. And so this process of
[36:34] adoption, I guess it's in some ways you
[36:36] could say that it's the fullness is
[36:38] achieved when the estate, brother Bam
[36:40] talks about kingdom or farm or a
[36:41] business. There are different ways of
[36:42] looking at it. We become the son's full
[36:45] legal possession. nothing lacking
[36:47] everything fully legally possessed and
[36:50] in that state uh there were certain
[36:52] legal words maybe brother Brandham used
[36:53] about equality but the son would then be
[36:56] the same as the father he would not just
[36:58] be merely acting on the father's
[37:00] authority as a son he would be given the
[37:03] privilege and a and a right to use the
[37:05] father's name and to act upon the
[37:07] father's authority and son I give you
[37:09] authority to manage this and I and I've
[37:11] given you authority and through the
[37:12] training and the tutoring the son could
[37:14] certainly rely upon the fact that his
[37:15] father. His name was on the marquee. His
[37:18] name was the on the on the business.
[37:20] This was his kingdom. And the fact that
[37:22] he was a son and an heir. He relied upon
[37:24] his father's character. He relied upon
[37:26] his father's testimony. But the idea
[37:28] behind adoption is there's come there's
[37:30] a point where the student has become as
[37:32] the master. And the father is like he
[37:34] runs it just as good as me. The servants
[37:37] don't need my name attached to what he
[37:39] wants. If if he says to do it, you got
[37:41] to do it because his name on the check
[37:44] is just as good as mine. Now,
[37:47] it would be one of maybe just using that
[37:49] type or that language, it'd be like if
[37:52] somebody objected to the son's
[37:54] authority, the father would say, "Who
[37:56] signed your check?" Like, "Well, you
[37:58] do." He's like, "Uh, look again."
[38:02] Your son's writing checks now. Oh, boy.
[38:05] Right.
[38:07] Or maybe what creation says is, "Yeah,
[38:10] yes. This is what we've been longing
[38:11] for." So the principle, and I know I'm
[38:13] belaboring this, but it's important.
[38:16] If the son demonstrated that he could
[38:17] govern like his father, he received the
[38:19] inheritance.
[38:20] Fully received the inheritance. That
[38:22] kind of I know you might be thinking,
[38:23] brother, it's overly simplistic given
[38:25] the numerous hours and dozens of sermons
[38:27] and statements brother made about it.
[38:29] But I think that I think it's in uh in
[38:32] harmony with the spirit of what brother
[38:33] taught. That this is the principle I
[38:36] want you to take from that. that a son,
[38:38] a child who's already a son, has the
[38:40] life of the father inside of him, has a
[38:42] father's DNA, has family relationship,
[38:43] has the name, is now in the process of
[38:45] his character being developed, not just
[38:47] for the sake of developing character.
[38:49] That's what Walt Disney does. They
[38:50] develop characters, but we're talking
[38:52] about that's the wrong kind of character
[38:54] if that's what you're you're wanting to
[38:55] have is working on your character not
[38:59] just for the sake of character, but in
[39:00] light of the fact that there's more to
[39:02] come.
[39:04] Right? So in Luke chapter 16 10-12, we
[39:07] use this on I think Wednesday night. He
[39:10] that is faithful and that which is least
[39:11] is faithful also in much. And he that is
[39:14] unjust in the least is unjust also in
[39:17] much. So there's this parallel principle
[39:20] that faithfulness begats more
[39:22] faithfulness. And if you do good with
[39:24] little, it demonstrates not just a
[39:28] proficiency with little and not just a a
[39:31] an ability with little, but a character
[39:35] that then is scalable. Is that a good
[39:37] buzz word? Or we've moved past that.
[39:39] Right? This is this is something that
[39:41] the Bible's recognizing uh ability that
[39:44] if you can be faithful with that, then I
[39:46] can trust you with more and more and
[39:47] more. And then if any point
[39:49] unfaithfulness is demonstrated, what the
[39:51] father would do is work with that
[39:53] through correction and rebuke until
[39:55] faithfulness is demonstrated. So you're
[39:57] either developing faithfulness or
[39:58] demonstrating faithfulness. Developing
[40:00] character, demonstrating character. So
[40:02] then this is it begs the question, if ye
[40:04] have not been faithful in the
[40:06] unrighteous mammon, who will commit to
[40:07] your trust the true riches?
[40:09] Right?
[40:11] If there's not a faithfulness with the
[40:12] things that God gives us on this side
[40:16] of eternity, then why is it God would
[40:18] grant us the true eternal riches on the
[40:20] other side of eternity?
[40:22] If I can't be faithful with things that
[40:23] are temporal, if I can't gain with the
[40:25] things that God has given me now, why
[40:26] would he give me more?
[40:29] So to the one, he gave one pound and he
[40:30] gained 10. He's saying if I gave him
[40:33] two, he'd gain 20. Right?
[40:35] The the the the the law, it's going to
[40:37] be exponential. and this increasing
[40:40] factor by these multiples. And then he
[40:42] says, "But if I gave this guy one and
[40:44] then I gave him two, guess what? I'm
[40:46] probably going to have two."
[40:47] Right?
[40:48] Because the same kind of dynamics uh and
[40:51] biases that work with the one are going
[40:52] to work with two,
[40:54] right? That's why some of you who who
[40:55] like to do certain investments and
[40:57] things, oh, if it only hits this price
[40:58] point, I'm going to sell. But then it
[41:00] hits it and you're kind of like, well,
[41:01] if it can hit that,
[41:04] right? And then, man, once once it
[41:07] starts dropping, man, I'm out. I'm going
[41:08] to exit this position. I'm out. And then
[41:10] it hits it and you're like, you know
[41:11] what? At this point, I might as well
[41:12] just hold on, you know, and I'm just
[41:14] going to ride this thing out, right? And
[41:16] so there's a lot of things that's these
[41:19] are biases working within your
[41:20] character, right? And this would be
[41:22] something where you got to learn to
[41:24] overcome these things. You got to learn
[41:25] better stewardship. And I tell you,
[41:26] brother Brandon makes some pretty
[41:27] incredible statements about when God
[41:29] gives you something and you just put it
[41:31] in your pocket, he says it ought to be
[41:32] put into circulation.
[41:34] So if you don't know what to do with it,
[41:36] this church will find something for it.
[41:38] But there's an idea of use your use it
[41:40] wisely. And he he he achieves such a
[41:42] beautiful balance. And for brother
[41:43] Brandham teaches some very incredible uh
[41:46] incredibly fruitful principles on
[41:48] investment to where we're not just going
[41:49] to bury it and hoard it, but we need to
[41:50] use it with wisdom and as far as risk
[41:52] determination and things like that. And
[41:54] so this is the idea of there's going to
[41:58] be more committed to you. But before you
[42:00] can more can be committed to you, be
[42:02] faithful with what you have. And if you
[42:04] have not been faithful in that which is
[42:06] another man, another's another man's,
[42:08] and this is where I want you to see the
[42:10] father, right? Because he's the one that
[42:12] legally owns it.
[42:13] You may have a right to it, but it's
[42:15] legally his. And it's done in such a way
[42:18] to where you couldn't necessarily sue
[42:20] for specific performance on him to give
[42:22] it to you because it's technically and
[42:24] legally not yours until he says so.
[42:27] So God does not owe us any reward out of
[42:30] debt.
[42:31] It's still grace. So, so if you cannot
[42:34] be faithful in that which is your
[42:35] father's, if you can't be faithful with
[42:37] the pound that God gave, you can't be
[42:39] faithful with the authority God gives
[42:40] the son and the the things the father is
[42:42] giving the son even to that prodical son
[42:44] who was given a portion of his state
[42:46] early and the how that framework would
[42:48] work if he comes back having wasted
[42:50] that. Right? There's this idea of the
[42:53] one who was faithful. Son, you've always
[42:54] been with me and you're going to inherit
[42:56] all of this. But this my son is still my
[42:58] son. He could come back with the rights
[43:00] and privileges of a son, but he doesn't
[43:02] necessarily have a full inheritance.
[43:05] Just just in by way of type, I know I'm
[43:06] kind of maybe pulling something in that
[43:08] we maybe need to be a little bit more
[43:10] strict with, but if you can't be
[43:11] faithful in that which is another's man,
[43:12] another man's, who shall give you that
[43:14] which is your own.
[43:16] That's incredible language to say that,
[43:18] well, if you can't be faithful with what
[43:20] is mine, then how are you going to be
[43:23] faithful when it becomes yours?
[43:25] If this is the attitude you had towards
[43:27] another man's, then how are you going to
[43:29] have a better attitude towards yours?
[43:31] And if you did, what kind of flaw in
[43:34] your character would that be?
[43:36] Right? If someone says, "Oh my goodness,
[43:38] brother Aaron, why are you why are you
[43:40] washing that brother's car that way? Why
[43:41] are you using a steel brush? And why are
[43:43] you using these harsh abrasive? Why are
[43:45] you using Barkeeper's Friend all over
[43:47] that nice paint job?" And it's like,
[43:49] "Ah, it's not mine." Right?
[43:52] And then and they show up at my house
[43:54] and I'm over just using a buffer. You
[43:55] know, I'm using all the right kind of
[43:56] compound. I only use meguiars, right?
[43:58] And everything's looking beautiful.
[43:59] Like, well, why are you doing it on this
[44:01] one? And you didn't know that. Well,
[44:02] this one's mine.
[44:03] And you all would have a right to say
[44:06] this guy lacks character, right? Why
[44:09] would he do that? Why would he treat
[44:10] somebody else's stuff worse than he
[44:12] treats his own? Wouldn't it show a lot
[44:13] more integrity if someone put all the
[44:15] effort and all the resources into and
[44:18] what is somebody else's even if at the
[44:20] detriment of their own to qualify now
[44:22] don't go crazy with it but it would
[44:23] speak of someone's character
[44:24] unselfishness that's the principle being
[44:27] expressed here so brother Brandham
[44:29] there's three statements from the
[44:30] sermons different here ye hymns one from
[44:33] 60 58 57
[44:35] and
[44:37] stay with me we're definitely going into
[44:40] the after hour
[44:42] says, "And here here you him now that
[44:44] child in the Old Testament, he never had
[44:47] any inheritance."
[44:49] Why? He's a child. He's a son. Why? The
[44:51] father couldn't trust him with anything.
[44:53] What kind of fellow would he be? But
[44:55] well, he couldn't trust him. He was
[44:57] always a son, but he never had any
[44:59] inheritance. You catching what brother's
[45:02] saying
[45:02] on this law of adoption, which here him
[45:04] is on the subject of adoption again in
[45:06] the next sermon.
[45:09] And I know these are saying the same
[45:10] thing and sometimes I found where
[45:11] they're being say said in relation to
[45:13] each other. So I'd say well it's not
[45:15] proving a different point. It's just for
[45:16] emphasis that this is just not something
[45:18] brother Brandham said in one place says
[45:20] but he now when a child was born in a
[45:23] family he was an heir certainly as soon
[45:26] as he was born. So there's there it
[45:28] tracks the language of the scripture
[45:29] Romans Galatians. But he didn't have any
[45:32] inheritance until he was proven.
[45:35] This is what Jesus is saying in Luke 16.
[45:38] This is what Paul is saying in Galatians
[45:40] 4. This is what's alluded to even in
[45:42] Romans 8. This is something a principle
[45:44] that would be firm within their culture,
[45:45] within the laws, whether it be Romans or
[45:47] Jews. This would be a process that they
[45:49] could understand in the natural, not to
[45:51] create a legal structure that would bind
[45:54] God. Like, well, that's not how the
[45:56] Romans did it, so God couldn't do it
[45:57] that way. Or that's not how the Jews did
[45:59] it, so God can't do it that way, or God
[46:01] has to do it that way. It it doesn't
[46:03] you're you can't you can't take a type
[46:05] to bind God. You
[46:07] you can't use it to try to keep God from
[46:09] doing what what he wants to do and how
[46:11] he wants to do it. So, brother, but the
[46:13] principle and the idea is that a son is
[46:15] a son, but there's an inheritance to be
[46:18] gained. And he is saying he never had an
[46:20] inheritance. He never had an
[46:21] inheritance.
[46:23] Didn't receive an inheritance until he
[46:24] was proven. The next one in 1957, when a
[46:27] boy was born, that boy was his son by
[46:29] birth. But yet, that son did not fall
[46:33] heir to everything until he become of
[46:34] age. And the father tested his
[46:36] character.
[46:38] So it speaks of an age of maturity, a
[46:40] certain kind of accountability. And
[46:42] there had to be a as he says here, there
[46:45] had to be trust. In the first statement,
[46:47] it has to be trust. In the second
[46:49] statement, he has to be proven. And in
[46:51] third, his character's tested,
[46:54] right? These are these are elements to
[46:56] determine when a son is worthy of an
[46:58] inheritance. And worth is something that
[47:00] comes up quite a bit. So this says sons
[47:03] of God or he's using the example of a
[47:06] son who stands to receive an inheritance
[47:09] and won't unless he can be trusted and
[47:12] be proven. That trust is proven and his
[47:14] character's been tested.
[47:16] Now Paul is drawing from these similar
[47:20] statements, similar uh concepts
[47:23] when he's teaching on an adoption for in
[47:25] the gentile dispensation. Romans chapter
[47:27] 8 14-6.
[47:30] Now,
[47:35] because the term adoption can be used to
[47:37] refer to a placing or the process
[47:41] whereby a a one who is already a son
[47:44] becomes placed or receives legal
[47:46] possession. Just because the term is
[47:48] used that way doesn't mean it cannot be
[47:50] used to refer to the sinner becoming
[47:53] children of God by birth. Because that's
[47:55] a principle that's used even in songs or
[47:58] there's an idea that brother Brandham
[47:59] uses in the message of the hour to kind
[48:01] of show the idea that we who were aliens
[48:03] and we who were not of the promise and
[48:05] we who were not children of of the book
[48:08] as it were like we have now been brought
[48:10] out in type, we have been gone from
[48:13] heathens and reprobates and servants and
[48:15] outcasts and to whom there was no
[48:18] prophets given and to whom it seemed
[48:19] that there was no heir. The mystery of
[48:21] God was that we actually were Right? So
[48:24] in type, we now have taken been aliens
[48:27] and and foreigners and we've now been
[48:29] placed in the family in relation to
[48:31] royalty and we use it as a type. But
[48:33] when we look at the truth of it, we
[48:34] realize we always were his to begin
[48:36] with.
[48:37] So it's just used to bring in certain
[48:39] ideas and a framework to kind of
[48:41] understand God's love for us and how God
[48:43] has changed our lives. So in Romans
[48:44] 8:14-16, for as many as are led by the
[48:47] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[48:50] One of the most important scriptures to
[48:51] a believer. Don't ever let anyone take
[48:54] the leadership of the Holy Spirit away
[48:56] from you.
[48:58] That's one of the most important uh
[49:00] markers of a believer is that they can
[49:04] be led by the spirit.
[49:06] For you have not received the spirit of
[49:08] bondage again to fear. I think there's
[49:10] some symmetry there with some of the
[49:12] things he's saying to the Galatians
[49:15] and what was demonstrated under the law.
[49:17] But ye have received the spirit of
[49:19] adoption whereby we cry, "Aba, Father.
[49:23] The spirit bear itself beareth witness
[49:25] with our spirit that we are the children
[49:28] of God.
[49:29] So this is true of every son and
[49:31] daughter of God. They are led by the
[49:32] spirit of God. Or if I could say this,
[49:35] you have available to you the perfect
[49:37] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[49:39] This is what we ought to yield to. We've
[49:41] received a spirit of adoption. So that
[49:43] is the Holy Spirit as there would be
[49:45] tutors and governors and that's the Holy
[49:47] Spirit is the teacher, the inside
[49:48] teacher. It is it is that spirit of
[49:51] adoption where its purpose is to bring
[49:52] you to perfection and to completion.
[49:55] And brother Brandham taught that the
[49:57] seal of the Holy Ghost is what births us
[49:59] into Christ.
[50:00] That's how that we're born into the
[50:01] family. It's that power to we say to
[50:04] become sons. But then it's not just the
[50:07] becoming. It's the expression and
[50:09] manifestation of it because again we
[50:11] could take by election. You always were
[50:12] a son. But there has to be a moment of
[50:14] birth where new life is birthed inside
[50:16] of you. Brother Brandham said that's
[50:17] when you are baptized into the body of
[50:19] Christ and it's by the seal of God, the
[50:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost. When you're
[50:22] filled with the Holy Ghost, you become a
[50:23] son
[50:24] in the family.
[50:26] And so, Brother Brandham used the law of
[50:27] adoption
[50:29] as a type of God's process. And notice
[50:32] the language I'm trying to use there. As
[50:34] a type of God's process to bring us into
[50:37] his image or the image of Christ.
[50:39] If Christ Brother even says that God
[50:41] adopted his own son, right? that that
[50:44] can be very staggering in itself and it
[50:46] wasn't at the Jordan River but he refers
[50:47] to Mount Transfiguration. So there's a
[50:50] tight there. There's an image that
[50:51] brother Brandham wants us to catch.
[50:52] There's something God is wanting to show
[50:54] in this that it relates to purpose and
[50:56] dispensation and ultimate calling. And
[50:59] so brother Brandham says that he's using
[51:02] this law of adoption as a type of God's
[51:04] process to bring us into his image
[51:06] as sons to grow us to train us to
[51:08] cultivate us. And so the Holy Spirit
[51:10] ought to be an inside teacher or tutor
[51:13] with the goal of fully placing us in our
[51:15] promise and fully positionally placing
[51:17] us in Christ. And and if we say that,
[51:20] oh, I I I have the Holy Ghost. It's the
[51:23] spirit of adoption. I I'm already
[51:26] positionally placed in Christ.
[51:29] Let's concede that.
[51:31] Now, manifest it.
[51:34] Take full possession of it.
[51:35] Amen.
[51:36] And you'll find what the process of
[51:37] adoption is. Because once we accept
[51:39] where we are, then the working out of
[51:42] that literal positional placing, even if
[51:44] it is the birth, is the process that
[51:46] brother Brandon uses as a type.
[51:48] It's the process that brother Brandon
[51:50] wants us to understand. You say, "Yep,
[51:51] you're a fully adopted son of God when
[51:53] you got the Holy Ghost." Now, develop it
[51:55] and demonstrate it.
[51:57] And again, that would be the process of
[51:59] character development. It doesn't, we
[52:00] don't want to invalidate anything
[52:02] brother Brandham said in this. So,
[52:04] Brother Brandham specifically said, and
[52:06] some of you probably already wrote it
[52:07] down. Your adoption is not your birth.
[52:10] Your adoption is your placing. And this
[52:13] is how Brother Brandham taught it. It's
[52:14] something that Brother Brandham was very
[52:17] uh very consistent in when he spoke on
[52:19] it. Now, I think this is a good
[52:22] foundation.
[52:24] And so, I want to transition just a
[52:25] little bit, but if you could just stay
[52:27] focused, you're doing tremendous
[52:28] wonderful job today. Tremendous kind of
[52:30] has with it the idea of terror or even
[52:32] terrific. It's like that's terrific.
[52:35] But um the subject of adoption now
[52:40] it it gives us it's a good framework
[52:43] what brother taught what the scriptures
[52:44] allude to gives us a good framework to
[52:46] understand judgment and rewards because
[52:49] I I I realize that as we've ministered
[52:50] on this there's there's things that have
[52:52] been added that have given more clarity
[52:53] and even some things clicking after
[52:55] Wednesday night. uh you know some just
[52:57] shared with me how that was the best
[52:58] sermon of all of them and think really
[53:00] made it click and um and that was very
[53:02] very encouraging to me and I always I
[53:04] encourage you to give feedback. I
[53:06] appreciate some of the brothers who are
[53:08] willing to fellowship on these things uh
[53:10] because it helps you to understand how
[53:12] God's dealing with somebody else's heart
[53:14] and because that's the goal, right? I I
[53:16] I'm not a professor up here who's just
[53:18] telling you what I've learned so I could
[53:19] test you on it later to find out if
[53:21] you've learned what I what I knew. But
[53:23] God's the one that's given you these
[53:25] things for your own edification, for
[53:26] your own benefit. And so testimonies
[53:28] sometimes to me, it's more encouraging,
[53:31] inspiring than the original inspiration
[53:33] to preach it because I'm like, whoa,
[53:34] that's what God was doing,
[53:37] right? And I'm like, man, why didn't I
[53:39] figure that out? That's even better than
[53:41] what I preached because it's not for me.
[53:42] It's for you. These things that God
[53:43] burdens me with. And so the subject of
[53:46] adoption and I say though it might be a
[53:48] little bit controversial in some ways
[53:50] it's a good framework to understand the
[53:52] bride's judgment for reward. And it is a
[53:55] vast subject.
[53:57] It is something that had brother
[53:59] Brandham not actually given so much
[54:01] emphasis to it. We might have found
[54:03] ourselves just kind of looking at it one
[54:06] way in the scripture and using a
[54:07] complete different vocabulary.
[54:10] We might have we might have used a
[54:11] complete different vocabul. We might not
[54:12] have said certain things that we do say.
[54:14] Even when it comes to the the wise and
[54:16] foolish virgins, if all we had was the
[54:19] Bible, we might not digest things and
[54:21] and dissect things in certain way and
[54:23] put such emphasis on things. But brother
[54:25] Brandham refers to it with such
[54:27] frequency that now we feel compelled to
[54:29] have a very strict legal category of
[54:32] wise virgin and foolish virgin and and
[54:34] and now on a a gradual cycle every 5
[54:37] years, they're going after the oil,
[54:40] right?
[54:41] They're doing it now. And and it had it
[54:44] never been mentioned by brother
[54:45] Brandham, we might have never even
[54:46] talked about foolish virgin trying to
[54:48] get the oil. We would have just used the
[54:50] parable within the context of other
[54:51] scriptural truths. And I believe that
[54:54] brother Brandham used it the same way.
[54:55] And so we don't want to just latch on to
[54:58] a framework, but understand the truth
[55:01] that's trying to be expressed through
[55:02] these words that brother Brandham was
[55:04] using. And so it's a vast subject. I'll
[55:06] admit that if we try to digest it all
[55:08] and figure it all out, it's easy to
[55:09] misunderstand. I'll even admit it's even
[55:12] easier to mispreach or to preach wrong.
[55:14] Uh I would even confess that one of the
[55:17] I there's as far as a subject in in in
[55:20] groundbreaking revelation for me once I
[55:22] first begin to uh serve the Lord and
[55:24] minister and it was when I first begin
[55:25] to minister this subject as it begin to
[55:27] open up to me and it was just becoming
[55:30] new to me. I preach from it and I
[55:32] realize now does Google have a means of
[55:35] going back and scrubbing your your all
[55:37] your tapes that are floating out there
[55:38] somewhere because you think yeah I
[55:41] probably would maybe I would emphasize
[55:43] that or you hope that in your zeal you
[55:46] gave it a particular emphasis that the
[55:48] person themselves appreciated within the
[55:50] framework and the context of what
[55:51] brother Brandon preached because there's
[55:52] I think it's even easier to preach wrong
[55:54] and I'll say so we want to be careful
[55:56] with it
[55:57] right
[55:57] be very careful because I do think it's
[55:59] a complex subject not complicated bit
[56:01] complex.
[56:03] Now, for my title today, losing crowns,
[56:07] this is judgment and rewards. That was a
[56:11] necessary foundation. Stick with me
[56:13] because we could go really fast through
[56:14] the rest of this. Maybe
[56:17] that was a necessary foundation because
[56:20] the subject of judgment rewards through
[56:22] every service probably you've seen that
[56:24] it's raising this awareness that there's
[56:25] things that can be lost. Things that can
[56:28] be gained and therefore available to be
[56:30] gained and they're not possessing it.
[56:32] They're considered loss. And now we've
[56:35] labored to express this especially
[56:38] through the few services and we're
[56:39] constantly reminding you that we are
[56:41] always his children. We are his
[56:43] children. We will always be his
[56:45] children. We can never lose our
[56:47] relationship with the father. And since
[56:49] salvation cannot be gained or lost at
[56:52] the judgment seat of Christ, it begs the
[56:54] question, then what is
[56:55] right?
[56:56] As 2 John 8 says, look to yourselves
[56:59] that we lose not those things which we
[57:00] have wrought, but that we receive a full
[57:02] reward.
[57:04] That that speaks of losing a full
[57:06] reward. Losing the things that you've
[57:07] labored for, the things that you've
[57:09] wrought. You're labor and you're
[57:10] laboring. There's something that's the
[57:11] byproduct of that. And John just makes
[57:13] this statement. consider yourself, stay
[57:15] disciplined, stay fervent, and stay
[57:17] faithful that you don't lose your work
[57:19] product, and that by virtue of it, you
[57:22] receive a full reward. Does it not imply
[57:24] the loss of something?
[57:27] And so, we we're recognizing that there
[57:29] is this idea of something gained and
[57:32] lost that has nothing to do with our
[57:34] relationship to Christ, nothing to do
[57:35] with the condition of our soul, but has
[57:37] something to do with glory, honor, and
[57:39] praise either in a moment or for
[57:41] eternity.
[57:42] Right? the judgment seat of Christ, the
[57:43] day of accountability, the day of
[57:44] reckoning.
[57:46] A little bit weak on the amens there.
[57:48] I'm not intimidated. I've got the rest
[57:50] of the year to to keep hammering this
[57:52] home. Now, this is somewhat of a
[57:56] transition, but this is an important
[57:57] kind of fulcrum point here. Church age
[58:00] book chapter 4. Notice what brother
[58:01] Bannam says. And I I I need I needed
[58:03] everything I've said to this point, and
[58:05] now we just this is a lot of um point
[58:08] after point has got to connect now. And
[58:11] it is in this overcoming overcomers the
[58:14] subject. Why will this overcomer this
[58:16] believer escape and go into realms of
[58:18] eternal life and bliss because Jesus
[58:20] paid the a price to ransom us from sin.
[58:24] He filled the gap of separation
[58:26] and we who are far off are now made nigh
[58:28] by the blood
[58:30] and they will never come into
[58:31] condemnation.
[58:33] This is the absolute truth that cannot
[58:35] be tampered with. They will never be in
[58:37] that lake of fire. So it's almost
[58:38] graduating. They won't be at white
[58:39] throne judgment condemnation. They'll
[58:41] never be in that lake of fire. They can
[58:42] never be lost.
[58:44] For he will ne lose none of them.
[58:47] This is yours.
[58:48] Right? The salvation is absolutely
[58:50] yours. Not one of the redeemed will be
[58:52] anywhere except where Jesus is.
[58:55] Do you know why that is?
[58:58] I will illustrate it for you. I have a
[59:01] little boy, Joseph.
[59:03] He is a part of me no matter what
[59:04] happens. If I were a rich man, the worst
[59:08] I could do would be to disinherit him.
[59:12] Are you be you following tracking?
[59:13] Brother Bam has given us an important
[59:15] key. And if you go back and look at some
[59:16] of the statements we've read from the
[59:17] Smyrnian church age already, there's a
[59:19] lot of statements that we've already
[59:20] read from it that brother Bram is using
[59:22] the type of suffering and suffering with
[59:24] his character and these different
[59:25] things. Even in this very chapter, if I
[59:28] were a rich man, if I had a lot of
[59:29] possessions, I had an estate, the worst
[59:30] thing I could do is disinherit him. But
[59:33] there's nothing I can ever do to deny
[59:35] him. I can't because he is a part of me.
[59:40] You catching this? A son's a son.
[59:43] I can't deny him.
[59:45] Just like bride, he can't deny the
[59:47] bride.
[59:48] He says the only thing that's available
[59:50] is disinheritance.
[59:52] Right? And if you want to know how to do
[59:54] that legally, I can show you.
[59:57] Says, "Here, let's take a blood test.
[59:59] Let's match his blood with mine. I'll
[1:00:02] prove that Joseph is my son by a blood
[1:00:05] test by birth. By the new birth, by the
[1:00:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost. He is mine.
[1:00:10] We're his as Christ is just as Joseph
[1:00:12] was brother. He's mine. It's the blood
[1:00:14] test that shows whether you belong to
[1:00:16] God or not.
[1:00:21] So, we are his sons. We are his
[1:00:23] daughters by blood.
[1:00:25] Amen.
[1:00:26] And we will be where he is. Amen.
[1:00:29] The only thing that could happen is we
[1:00:31] just don't get a full inheritance.
[1:00:34] Revelations 3:11, watch how this builds.
[1:00:37] Behold, I come quickly.
[1:00:40] Hold fast what thou hast.
[1:00:43] What's been given to you, what you've
[1:00:44] earned, whatever it is, hold fast
[1:00:45] whatever you've got.
[1:00:47] Let no man take thy crown.
[1:00:51] Hold fast to that. You hold fast to what
[1:00:53] you have so that you you stand to gain.
[1:00:58] by what you have
[1:01:00] and hold fast to what thou hast that no
[1:01:04] man take thy crown.
[1:01:07] Again, I think the image we rec used
[1:01:08] before is it suggests that there is
[1:01:12] something to be gained and in the
[1:01:15] failure to gain it, there's loss.
[1:01:18] Brother Brandham says in the uncertain
[1:01:20] sound, he says, "Be careful. Some don't
[1:01:22] take your crown."
[1:01:25] You could lose a crown.
[1:01:27] You say it has my name on it. I mean, no
[1:01:29] matter how you look at it, you either
[1:01:30] have it now, it can be taken or you
[1:01:32] stand to receive it and it's given to
[1:01:34] somebody else. You've lost it.
[1:01:36] And I know some of the traders, you
[1:01:37] know, they can recognize traders, not
[1:01:39] like Benedict Arnold, but day traders,
[1:01:41] people that have made a lot of money on
[1:01:43] ADA, uh, they they they recognize this
[1:01:46] idea of like whenever something
[1:01:48] increases in value and then it decreases
[1:01:50] and you're like, "Oh, I've lost." Have
[1:01:52] you?
[1:01:53] Right.
[1:01:53] There certainly is a sense of it,
[1:01:55] right? If you invested at 10, it goes up
[1:01:57] to 100 and back down to 20. You feel
[1:01:59] like you've lost, right? You feel like
[1:02:01] you've lost that gain. And so I think
[1:02:04] that there's there's this idea of what
[1:02:07] you stood to gain. There's a sense of
[1:02:09] loss. You didn't get as much as you
[1:02:11] could.
[1:02:13] And too bad the IRS doesn't let us use
[1:02:15] that.
[1:02:18] Now he says f in the sermon, father, the
[1:02:20] hour has come. This was a much larger
[1:02:21] quote, but I wanted to express this
[1:02:23] principle. The time will be here soon to
[1:02:25] give out the rewards.
[1:02:27] Brother, be careful that your crown
[1:02:29] isn't set on someone else's head.
[1:02:32] The time has come. We're at the end
[1:02:33] time. If we're going to do anything,
[1:02:35] brethren, we're going to do it now.
[1:02:37] So, there's the idea of labor. If you're
[1:02:38] going to labor, you're going to get some
[1:02:39] work done. You need to do it now because
[1:02:40] the time has come and rewards going to
[1:02:42] be handed out. And if you haven't
[1:02:43] labored correctly, you haven't done your
[1:02:44] labor, you haven't finished your race,
[1:02:45] you haven't done what you're supposed to
[1:02:46] do, then be careful. If your crown isn't
[1:02:49] taken that should have been on your
[1:02:50] head, the glory, the honor, the praise,
[1:02:52] whatever that reward might be, brother
[1:02:54] Brandham identified a reward for his
[1:02:56] service. Whatever that might be, be sure
[1:02:58] that it's not given to somebody else.
[1:03:01] Says just in one place, be careful some
[1:03:03] don't take your crown here, brother. Be
[1:03:04] careful that your crown isn't set on
[1:03:06] someone else's head at the time when
[1:03:08] rewards are given out.
[1:03:10] This is why I could have so much
[1:03:12] confidence preaching this subject. It's
[1:03:14] in the message of the hour in the sermon
[1:03:17] wisdom versus faith. He says, "Now if
[1:03:18] you have eternal life today, you are in
[1:03:20] God."
[1:03:22] By God's being in you, you are God's
[1:03:24] expressed thought.
[1:03:27] Then don't listen to any reasonings lest
[1:03:29] your crown be taken and give to another.
[1:03:33] Don't take any reasonings at all. Just
[1:03:35] believe what God said is the truth and
[1:03:36] stay with it.
[1:03:38] What is he referring to? Losing crowns.
[1:03:40] Right.
[1:03:41] He's just referring to it like, "Hey, be
[1:03:43] careful. You have eternal life. It's
[1:03:45] yours. You got it. Can't take it away
[1:03:47] from you. Wouldn't want to. Couldn't if
[1:03:50] I did want to. It's yours. You're a son
[1:03:52] or daughter of God. But I can say this.
[1:03:56] Be sure you're listening to the word,
[1:03:57] growing in the word. Don't reason it
[1:03:59] out. Don't be influenced by anything
[1:04:01] else. Because what you do stand to gain
[1:04:04] or lose is what you stood to gain.
[1:04:06] Right?
[1:04:07] What you stand to lose, he says, is your
[1:04:09] crown.
[1:04:11] Look at these witnesses losing crowns.
[1:04:15] Not based upon your birth, but your
[1:04:17] character.
[1:04:19] In Galatians chapter 2, 18 and 19. I've
[1:04:22] had multiple places maybe to try to use
[1:04:24] this uh early on, but I keep I've
[1:04:27] studied at length on voluntary humility,
[1:04:30] and there's so much expressed in that.
[1:04:33] And what Paul is basing this on in verse
[1:04:38] uh the you'll find that uh you enjoying
[1:04:42] yourselves today?
[1:04:45] I'm just trying to decide whether I want
[1:04:46] to say it now or as I continue. But Paul
[1:04:48] just makes a statement and then he's
[1:04:50] building that statement through so much
[1:04:52] else. And I apologize. I know some of
[1:04:54] you are tired and you're struggling a
[1:04:55] little bit. Uh that u I understand. I I
[1:04:58] I I certainly understand these things
[1:05:01] are laborious. Even if someone more
[1:05:03] dynamic was preaching it, it's a lot of
[1:05:05] dense stuff. But Paul just says
[1:05:07] something as a matter of fact and he
[1:05:09] kind of throws it out there. But then
[1:05:10] what he uses as to support what he just
[1:05:13] said has a lot to do. It's such a much
[1:05:15] bigger subject that should be explored.
[1:05:17] So I'll just read it to you, maybe try
[1:05:18] to do it justice. Let no man begal you
[1:05:20] of your reward.
[1:05:23] Huh?
[1:05:24] Paul, could you talk about that a little
[1:05:25] bit more? No. You you know what I'm
[1:05:27] talking about. Don't let anybody steal
[1:05:29] steal your reward from you. Don't let
[1:05:31] them deceive you into conduct that
[1:05:33] invalidates what you stand to gain. Just
[1:05:35] matter of fact,
[1:05:36] what is that reward? How can I beguiled
[1:05:38] out of it? He says, "Let no man beguile
[1:05:40] you of your reward." Here's one way it
[1:05:41] happens.
[1:05:44] Because the man in a voluntary humility,
[1:05:46] are we going together right now?
[1:05:49] In a voluntary humility and worshiping
[1:05:51] of angels, this is how the man begs you
[1:05:53] out of reward. intrude into those things
[1:05:55] which he hath not seen
[1:05:58] vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.
[1:06:02] The in other words, there's men that
[1:06:04] would begal you through their own
[1:06:07] prideful inspiration about the word of
[1:06:09] God and not the truth and reality of the
[1:06:11] word of God. Preaching things that are
[1:06:14] not revelation that they have not been
[1:06:15] shown or seen. Their vanity and their
[1:06:18] and their thinking too much of
[1:06:19] themselves has puffed them up. It's
[1:06:21] their own carnality that has allowed
[1:06:23] them to get to this point and they're
[1:06:25] not holding the head.
[1:06:28] So, this is a this is a a very clear
[1:06:31] challenge to men of God that when you
[1:06:33] minister, you're holding up the head.
[1:06:36] You're you're pointing to Jesus Christ.
[1:06:39] Because if it's not what you if it's not
[1:06:41] the revelation of Jesus Christ and it
[1:06:44] it's the the the puffed up vanity of
[1:06:46] Aaron McGaryi then there's this fain
[1:06:49] humility to to of trying to help you and
[1:06:53] then in your sincerity you p you follow
[1:06:56] after that and Paul is saying be careful
[1:06:59] because no matter how inspired that man
[1:07:02] may seem no matter how sincere you may
[1:07:05] be in following him there's a beging of
[1:07:08] your reward. Lord in doing it
[1:07:11] because they don't hold up. The head
[1:07:13] Christ
[1:07:14] from which all the body by joints and
[1:07:16] bands having nourishment ministered
[1:07:19] and knit together increasth with the
[1:07:22] increase of God.
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:23] Paul is saying in very plain language,
[1:07:25] we stand to lose our reward by following
[1:07:27] wrong teaching.
[1:07:29] I know I'm somewhat of a legalist
[1:07:31] because brother man said the evidence of
[1:07:32] the Holy Ghost is when you can say amen
[1:07:34] uh to the word of God. And I know
[1:07:36] paraphrasing. He said, "How could the
[1:07:37] Holy Ghost in you ever deny his word?"
[1:07:40] So we can be very strict legalists. And
[1:07:41] so we could give somebody the word test
[1:07:43] and say, "Well, brother Bham taught
[1:07:44] this." And you're like, "Oh, I don't
[1:07:45] believe it. It's this." You say,
[1:07:46] "Whoop." Right? Just make a quick
[1:07:48] judgment about who they are and whether
[1:07:50] or not they have the Holy Ghost. And I
[1:07:52] think we ought to be very gracious and
[1:07:53] and more concerned about ourselves in
[1:07:56] those regards and judge nothing before
[1:07:58] it's time. But there is a price to pay a
[1:08:02] big gallon of your reward
[1:08:05] by allowing someone
[1:08:08] by feeding on something that's not
[1:08:10] nourishing you.
[1:08:13] There there there's a begile of reward
[1:08:16] by submitting to unfaithful leadership
[1:08:18] that has not submitted to the message of
[1:08:20] the hour that is not holding up the head
[1:08:22] which is Christ.
[1:08:22] Amen.
[1:08:23] Can anybody say amen from experience?
[1:08:26] There's a price to pay for this. I know
[1:08:28] that's strong language, but just
[1:08:30] recognize how Paul is wanting the the
[1:08:32] Colossian believer to process this. That
[1:08:35] where there's a lack of nourishment,
[1:08:38] there's a lack of increase.
[1:08:40] And where there's a lack of increase in
[1:08:41] energy to your experience, there's a
[1:08:43] lack of fruit.
[1:08:44] And fruit is what God is looking for.
[1:08:46] So, it has nothing to do with whether or
[1:08:48] not you have the Holy Ghost. It doesn't
[1:08:49] have anything to do with whether or not
[1:08:50] you've been sealed by God. Doesn't have
[1:08:52] anything to do with whether or not
[1:08:53] you're you're his son. But it has
[1:08:54] everything to do with whether or not
[1:08:56] this son is being properly tutored and
[1:08:58] child trained and matured and growing
[1:09:00] under the word of God with something
[1:09:02] faithful lifting up Christ and Christ
[1:09:04] alone. And that that's what is
[1:09:06] channeling to me the energy. I am
[1:09:08] getting the energy from the vine that
[1:09:11] allows this branch to bear fruit.
[1:09:15] And he's saying you can because of a
[1:09:17] lack of fruitfulness be beguiled out of
[1:09:18] your reward.
[1:09:20] You can lose your reward by not
[1:09:22] fulfilling your potential. Lose your
[1:09:25] reward by living below your privilege.
[1:09:28] You're a branch that should bring forth
[1:09:29] a hundfold. You're only eating out 15%
[1:09:33] and 35% still a son, you'll even get
[1:09:36] something for what you're fruitful for.
[1:09:39] But Paul is saying because you've let
[1:09:42] these things
[1:09:44] through fear or whatever it might be
[1:09:47] rob you from the proper nourishment you
[1:09:48] could get. That's why you're not a
[1:09:50] hundy,
[1:09:51] right? That's why you're not as much as
[1:09:53] you could be
[1:09:54] because you're you're not willing to
[1:09:56] submit yourself
[1:09:58] to Christ.
[1:09:59] Amen.
[1:10:04] I feel like I should preach an hour on
[1:10:06] that.
[1:10:08] Second Timothy 2:5
[1:10:10] captures the same thought. This is
[1:10:11] losing crowns. And if a man also strive
[1:10:14] for masteries, yet he's not crowned
[1:10:15] except he strive lawfully.
[1:10:18] A man who strives for the masteries. In
[1:10:20] other words, a man who strives for the
[1:10:23] perfection in order to achieve the
[1:10:25] prize. The man who strives for the
[1:10:26] prize. A man who strives for the crown
[1:10:28] is not going to be crowned except he
[1:10:30] strive lawfully. Strive there means to
[1:10:32] endure and to speaks of contest and a
[1:10:34] and and and crown that encircling of
[1:10:36] this glory, this honor, this praise. But
[1:10:38] he must strive lawfully. Remember that's
[1:10:40] a rule or a law or a condition which
[1:10:43] produces a state approved by God. that
[1:10:46] we have to be lawful. It's not just
[1:10:48] finishing the race, but it's finishing
[1:10:50] it with praise and honor and glory. It's
[1:10:52] being able to what? Demonstrate growth
[1:10:54] of character.
[1:10:55] Amen.
[1:10:56] I don't want to just make it to a grave.
[1:10:57] I want to make it to a grave. And if I
[1:11:01] make it to a grave, I want my character
[1:11:03] that's going to go with me to be worthy
[1:11:04] of a full reward
[1:11:06] because I'm not taking anything else. I
[1:11:07] take my character with me. And it's my
[1:11:09] character that I'm going to present to
[1:11:10] Christ. And you say, "Well, what does it
[1:11:12] mean you take your character with you?
[1:11:13] Why does it even matter?" Well, it's
[1:11:14] going to be judged.
[1:11:16] My soul is perfect. What does my
[1:11:18] character look like? How was I able to
[1:11:19] yield to this powerful force?
[1:11:22] Listen, the most powerful force there is
[1:11:24] in the world is inside there is anywhere
[1:11:27] dwells inside of the redeemed son of
[1:11:29] God. And should we not just yield to it?
[1:11:33] Lord, I submit myself to your design.
[1:11:34] and I I yield myself to your process
[1:11:38] that it might produce in me a character
[1:11:42] that stands before that day
[1:11:44] and is tried by fire and it's it
[1:11:46] radiates in his glory and he's like well
[1:11:49] my faithful servant
[1:11:51] you've been you've done well with this
[1:11:53] enter more into more
[1:11:57] you know there's a thought you know your
[1:12:00] character you take your character with
[1:12:02] you and what you leave is a legacy
[1:12:05] It's what's left for others. And and and
[1:12:08] I'm afraid that that's one of the
[1:12:09] biggest problems today is too many
[1:12:11] people are living within legacies.
[1:12:13] And what they need to do is leave a
[1:12:14] legacy
[1:12:15] to follow Christ.
[1:12:16] Amen.
[1:12:21] In the sermon, here ye him.
[1:12:24] This is where this is where brother
[1:12:26] Bram's now supporting this over and
[1:12:29] over. back in the Old Testament when a
[1:12:30] father owned a big kingdom and a child
[1:12:32] was born into that kingdom. He was a son
[1:12:34] as soon as he was born. He says, "But
[1:12:37] yet that son didn't was the but yet son
[1:12:41] didn't." He's he's entering into a
[1:12:43] phrase to say something. He's a son but
[1:12:46] he's a son yet. He's a son but that son
[1:12:49] didn't. So I recognize it's a fragment.
[1:12:51] I'm keeping it in there because then he
[1:12:53] continues,
[1:12:56] "He would be heir of all the father had
[1:12:58] if his character was right."
[1:13:01] But first, his character had to be
[1:13:03] proved.
[1:13:04] Now, you ministers know where I'm going
[1:13:06] to. It's the placing of a son. Now, but
[1:13:09] his character didn't show up right. He
[1:13:12] didn't inherit anything. He was just a
[1:13:13] son.
[1:13:14] Yeah. Be careful that we don't just
[1:13:15] belittle just a son. But he is trying to
[1:13:17] show some sort of scale here. Still a
[1:13:19] son. But if his character wasn't right,
[1:13:23] recognize the emphasis. I think that's
[1:13:24] why Wednesday night was so necessary.
[1:13:26] Character development. Recognize the
[1:13:27] emphasis. If his character is not right,
[1:13:29] and here ye him, I I I'm not going to
[1:13:32] apologize this morning,
[1:13:33] but I am going to go try to go faster.
[1:13:35] When that son was born into the family,
[1:13:37] he was a son at birth, but his
[1:13:40] inheritance was not yet determined.
[1:13:42] It depended on his character.
[1:13:45] Brother Bam's teaching us something
[1:13:46] important here. So though being a son
[1:13:49] and if he was a disobedient son he would
[1:13:52] not inherit anything but still he was a
[1:13:54] son. Brother Brandham's referring to the
[1:13:57] process of adoption in the natural
[1:14:00] whether you would use Roman law or
[1:14:02] Jewish law as a type of the framework of
[1:14:06] God's process not to produce a strict
[1:14:09] legalistic doctrine that we try to apply
[1:14:13] uh formally or legally to things. He's
[1:14:16] using as a framework to see God does the
[1:14:17] same thing in type.
[1:14:20] But if he was an obedient son, he was
[1:14:22] heir to all things. So you got an
[1:14:23] obedient son on one hand, a disobedient
[1:14:25] son on the other. One both remains sons,
[1:14:27] but one inherits more. And we've been
[1:14:30] taught, this is where I'm bringing it
[1:14:31] down to where his spiritual application.
[1:14:33] We have been taught not only through
[1:14:34] Pentecostal realms, but through the
[1:14:36] holiness group and the Baptist and what
[1:14:37] more that when you're born again, we are
[1:14:39] sons of God. That's true. Yes,
[1:14:42] but that yet that goes back to his but
[1:14:46] that yet even in that other statement
[1:14:48] but that yet that's just the beginning
[1:14:52] state this statement is so huge then
[1:14:54] it's your character from then on what
[1:14:56] means the difference
[1:14:59] so you have the the life of God inside
[1:15:02] of you you are going to come up in the
[1:15:04] first resurrection you are in the family
[1:15:06] you are a son I I I just I I I tremble
[1:15:10] to trivialize that exper experience on
[1:15:12] any level.
[1:15:13] But but brother Ben Brandom teaches us
[1:15:15] shows us that though a son, you can
[1:15:17] learn something.
[1:15:19] Though a son, you can suffer something.
[1:15:22] Though a daughter, you can still grow.
[1:15:24] Though you're heir to our first
[1:15:26] resurrection that the only You say,
[1:15:28] "Well, what difference? What's going to
[1:15:29] make the difference?" The only way a
[1:15:30] difference is made is your character.
[1:15:34] And character is a
[1:15:37] not a gift.
[1:15:41] And if I gota be careful how I say it,
[1:15:44] so you just fill in the blank.
[1:15:47] If what brother B is referring to the
[1:15:49] product is
[1:15:51] I is this character is the final
[1:15:53] determining factor then we have to be
[1:15:56] looking at something that's a victory
[1:15:58] and not given as a gift.
[1:16:00] Wow.
[1:16:02] 1 Corinthians chapter 9 27.
[1:16:08] It's been a long time, maybe since in
[1:16:10] the beginning. And I know some of you
[1:16:11] are going Genesis 1. Wow. But I'm
[1:16:13] talking about like o September, October,
[1:16:15] November when the church started. It's
[1:16:16] probably been a long time since I've
[1:16:17] been gone two hours. So I got to get it
[1:16:19] out of me.
[1:16:21] First Corinthians chapter 9 27. But I
[1:16:23] keep under my body and bring it into
[1:16:26] subjection. Remember the things we've
[1:16:27] ministered on this already. Lest that by
[1:16:29] any means when I have preached to
[1:16:31] others, Paul is not all of a sudden
[1:16:32] becoming wishy-washy about his
[1:16:34] experience. Right?
[1:16:36] And he he gives his resume like nobody
[1:16:38] else.
[1:16:39] Right?
[1:16:40] Like this guy knew who he was, knew his
[1:16:42] gift, knew that he had been caught up
[1:16:43] into this realms. They'd seen visions.
[1:16:45] He's like, "Hey, you know what? I got a
[1:16:47] revelation. I got a direct direct from
[1:16:48] God. I met with the apostles. They added
[1:16:50] nothing to my understanding, by the
[1:16:51] way."
[1:16:52] Right? Like Paul wasn't kind of
[1:16:54] wishy-washy on this. But notice the
[1:16:56] reality. This is one of the things that
[1:16:58] Paul grounded Paul is he realized, I can
[1:17:02] have I can meet Jesus Christ, my Lord. I
[1:17:04] can be struck down by a pillar of fire.
[1:17:06] I could have my eyes blinded then opened
[1:17:07] again. I could be baptized and I could
[1:17:10] be filled with the Holy Ghost. And I
[1:17:11] could preach and I could win others. And
[1:17:12] I could see many souls won to the
[1:17:15] kingdom of God through my labor and
[1:17:16] through my work. But I realize that
[1:17:18] through all these gifts and talents that
[1:17:20] God has given me that have been fruitful
[1:17:22] in ministry, unless I bring my body
[1:17:25] under subjection and I buffet my own
[1:17:28] will and I keep my own ideas and my own
[1:17:30] opinions and my own vanity. If I don't
[1:17:32] keep it under subjection, if I don't
[1:17:34] suffer, this is where I was trying to
[1:17:35] amplify the meaning of suffering a
[1:17:37] little bit than just being persecuted by
[1:17:38] somebody that doesn't like you. But if I
[1:17:40] cause myself to suffer by making the
[1:17:42] sacrifices to pay my tithes when I ought
[1:17:45] to, being at church when I know I should
[1:17:46] be, making the difficult decisions when
[1:17:49] I'm raising my children, if I keep under
[1:17:51] my body and I faithfully watch out over
[1:17:53] theirs, I don't want to be somebody
[1:17:55] who's been used by God to bless others,
[1:17:57] end up myself being a cast away.
[1:18:01] Because Paul realized that as a son,
[1:18:03] he'd always be a son.
[1:18:04] And the worst thing that could happen to
[1:18:06] him is he'd be disinherited.
[1:18:10] Cast away means not approved. It's what
[1:18:12] the word means. I I I keep under my
[1:18:14] body. I suffer. I discipline myself. I
[1:18:17] labor the more because I realize that
[1:18:19] having the Holy Ghost and being gifted
[1:18:21] as I have been is just the beginning.
[1:18:23] It's my character that's going to make
[1:18:25] the difference
[1:18:27] because we've all got the blood tag at
[1:18:29] that point,
[1:18:31] right? Brother uses an example to say
[1:18:33] the blood is important, but that's the
[1:18:34] beauty of the rapture. Only those who
[1:18:36] have this blood are there. Yes, Amen.
[1:18:38] So, at that point, he's not Let's see
[1:18:40] here. Can we do a blood test? Like,
[1:18:41] yeah, I'm I'm on keto, so I've already
[1:18:43] done one just now. I'm I'm still
[1:18:44] ketosis. Like, you mean your perfect
[1:18:46] body is? Yeah, I imagine. I don't know.
[1:18:49] What if over there we need to be
[1:18:52] opposite of that? Like gaining pounds,
[1:18:54] right?
[1:18:56] Um I don't know. But could it be?
[1:19:01] It's to be displeasing.
[1:19:04] he loses something,
[1:19:06] right?
[1:19:06] My character is gonna be what makes the
[1:19:07] difference? I've got the blood. What's
[1:19:09] going to make the difference? I'm his
[1:19:10] son, but what's going to make the
[1:19:11] difference? Brother Brandham said,
[1:19:13] character is what means the difference?
[1:19:16] Paul, as we've said before, so he says
[1:19:18] that I be a castway. In other words, I'm
[1:19:20] not pleasing. And if not pleasing, I'm
[1:19:22] not deserving of a reward.
[1:19:23] He's dealt with it already in first
[1:19:24] Corinthians to great great detail. Maybe
[1:19:26] the one book and to the Corinthian
[1:19:28] church, he deals with it more than any
[1:19:29] other. Paul wasn't afraid of losing his
[1:19:31] sunship or losing his relationship or
[1:19:34] being found out to be a fraud. You know,
[1:19:36] like, oh, we we we tested you and you're
[1:19:38] actually not rapture positive.
[1:19:42] Well, what am I doing here? You know
[1:19:43] what? It just slipped through. I'm
[1:19:45] sorry. We're doing an audit on blood
[1:19:47] tests. I know you've enjoyed that
[1:19:49] glorified body for a while, but back to
[1:19:51] tribulation.
[1:19:52] It's not going to happen. Paul couldn't
[1:19:54] lose his sunship. He couldn't lose his
[1:19:55] relationship, but he didn't want to be
[1:19:57] disinherited.
[1:19:59] Brother Benham says this and hear ye him
[1:20:01] in 1960. Now if that boy was born into
[1:20:03] the home he as a son he did not become a
[1:20:06] right boy would not follow his father's
[1:20:09] instructions would not be about his
[1:20:10] father's business. I I I I I love this
[1:20:14] because I'll say I I I know that there's
[1:20:17] uh there's ways of viewing the subject
[1:20:19] of adoption maybe from a different angle
[1:20:22] that you use to encourage people who
[1:20:24] don't have the Holy Ghost to get the
[1:20:25] Holy Ghost. And and I recognize that
[1:20:27] that there could be that there's even a
[1:20:29] theme that you see where brother
[1:20:30] Brandham is trying to shake the people
[1:20:32] who think they've got it to shake them
[1:20:34] into seeking more. Right?
[1:20:37] And don't just just don't say, "Oh, you
[1:20:39] you've got it because you believe and
[1:20:40] you think you've got it."
[1:20:42] But notice that the same the the desire
[1:20:44] for more and the correctness of
[1:20:46] someone's life, it's the same thing
[1:20:48] if you just validate
[1:20:51] what their experience is supposed to do.
[1:20:54] Right. That's what Brother Brown was
[1:20:55] trying to do. Oh, you say you got the
[1:20:56] Holy Ghost. Awesome. That's great. Cuz
[1:20:57] then this is what you need to do next.
[1:21:00] Right. It it to me it has this
[1:21:02] motivating factor. He says if he was if
[1:21:04] not a right boy follow the father's
[1:21:06] instruction would not be about the
[1:21:07] father's business. That boy was always a
[1:21:10] son. But he never did have any
[1:21:12] inheritance.
[1:21:15] He says, "Did you know that?" And those
[1:21:17] who've been awake today at least say
[1:21:19] yes.
[1:21:20] Yeah, we did know that he never got any
[1:21:22] inheritance. He was just a castaway.
[1:21:26] He was always a son. And when you didn't
[1:21:28] get the Holy Ghost, he says, "And when
[1:21:30] you get the Holy Ghost, you're God's son
[1:21:31] or God's daughter. That's true enough.
[1:21:34] But if you don't obey God, walk in the
[1:21:36] light, walk in the word, believe God,
[1:21:38] then you won't have an inheritance."
[1:21:40] Well, that's just exactly the way God
[1:21:41] does it yet.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:43] In other words, he loses something.
[1:21:47] I use the phrase losing crowns because
[1:21:50] it's a figure, a speech. It's a It's a
[1:21:52] noun. something that's used in the
[1:21:53] scripture. But can we just say something
[1:21:55] is lost,
[1:21:56] right?
[1:21:56] And brother Brandham says he was just a
[1:21:58] cast away.
[1:21:59] That's exactly what Paul was afraid of
[1:22:01] to be a castaway. Brother Brandham even
[1:22:03] uses the exact language in Abraham and
[1:22:05] his seat after him. How can he ever get
[1:22:06] that son anything? You know what happens
[1:22:09] to that son? He's always a son. So you
[1:22:11] see it's the same subject. Sure. Yes,
[1:22:13] sir. But he has no inheritance.
[1:22:17] Paul said, "Lest I preach the gospel and
[1:22:19] be a cast away myself." He doesn't come
[1:22:22] into inheritance.
[1:22:24] This is what Paul's referring to.
[1:22:27] Castaway means you're not tossed off the
[1:22:28] gospel ship. It doesn't mean that you're
[1:22:30] no longer a son. This is the language
[1:22:32] that Paul is using in light of what he
[1:22:34] just so casually references. Be careful
[1:22:36] no man begs of your reward by doing
[1:22:37] this, this, this, and this. This is what
[1:22:40] he's talking about. The grace that is
[1:22:43] expressed in this. And I believe I know
[1:22:46] that again as I met referenced before I
[1:22:47] know there's like this danger line where
[1:22:49] some people can just take these things
[1:22:50] and use it as an excuse for all sorts of
[1:22:52] disobedience and lack of faithfulness
[1:22:54] and the reason why they don't do this
[1:22:55] and the reason why they don't do that.
[1:22:56] They just say, "Oh, well, I just haven't
[1:22:58] been adopted yet." All right, you're
[1:22:59] going to use whatever excuse you can,
[1:23:01] right? You're going to blame COVID
[1:23:03] brain. You're going to say, "Thanks,
[1:23:04] Obama." Whatever it might be, you're
[1:23:06] going to have your excuses. We get it.
[1:23:08] And so, I'm not going to change the word
[1:23:10] of God to fight with your excuses.
[1:23:13] I I am now pleading the fifth with my
[1:23:15] children when they start asking me
[1:23:16] questions. I'm like, I don't have to
[1:23:17] answer that question. And they say, 'Why
[1:23:19] not? And I go, I don't have to answer
[1:23:20] that question either.
[1:23:24] Right. And and why don't you answer that
[1:23:26] question? Nor do I want to answer that
[1:23:28] question. Right. And then they're like,
[1:23:31] man, I just wish you would answer my
[1:23:32] question. And I'm like, which one?
[1:23:35] Right? And that's what the devil does to
[1:23:37] us sometimes. Throws a bunch of stuff
[1:23:39] out there and muddies everything up and
[1:23:40] then wants an answer from us. you
[1:23:42] muddied it up. You figure it out.
[1:23:45] I I'll just stay stay with what I know.
[1:23:47] I'll stay with the truth. I'll stay
[1:23:48] within the parameters that that I think
[1:23:50] are are as God leads me and deals with
[1:23:52] my heart. And so notice that Paul is
[1:23:55] referring to something something very
[1:23:56] precious, something very real, something
[1:23:58] very uh uh uh relevant to him as he's
[1:24:00] trying to inspire uh the believer and
[1:24:02] even himself and speaks about his own
[1:24:04] experience. And this is what he said in
[1:24:05] 1 Corinthians 3:8. I'm just saying this
[1:24:07] so you realize that Paul was conscious
[1:24:08] of the concept of a judgment for a word.
[1:24:11] says, "Will we not all stand before the
[1:24:12] judgment seat of Christ?"
[1:24:15] He says here, "Now he that planteth and
[1:24:17] he that waterth are one. We're all
[1:24:19] laboring for the same thing. But and
[1:24:22] every man shall receive his own reward
[1:24:24] according to his own labor."
[1:24:25] Amen.
[1:24:27] I'm a laborer for Christ. I'm a servant
[1:24:28] of Christ. I'm his own. I've been
[1:24:30] called. I got this to do. But I'm going
[1:24:31] to answer for my labor. I will be held
[1:24:33] accountable.
[1:24:35] Paul knew it. He recognized it.
[1:24:38] And so the sermon hear ye him. Brother
[1:24:39] Bam says, "Now, if that boy is no good,
[1:24:41] yet he's a son. He's never nothing but a
[1:24:44] son because he's born to son." This is
[1:24:46] the language that Brother Benham's using
[1:24:48] about the type, the natural type, the
[1:24:51] process. Just as Jesus said, I'm coming
[1:24:54] to it here in a moment. So, you know,
[1:24:55] I've still got to go to Luke chapter 19.
[1:24:57] I got a statement from here ye him. I
[1:24:58] got another hear ye him. I got Romans
[1:25:00] 12. I've got 2 Corinthians 5. I've got
[1:25:03] some random statement here. I forgot
[1:25:04] what sermon it is. And then I got a big
[1:25:05] quote from spiritual adoption. Are we
[1:25:07] good?
[1:25:08] You know, like that's what I got left
[1:25:17] that boy is no good just as Jesus called
[1:25:19] him a wicked servant. Like, oh, so he
[1:25:20] said he was wicked. He said he was
[1:25:22] wicked. Well, he also said as a shepherd
[1:25:24] dividing the sheep from goats.
[1:25:25] But it it was it was language that we
[1:25:27] could understand. Who are these
[1:25:28] righteous that stand in judgment?
[1:25:30] Brother Bam said. So he says he says he
[1:25:32] was born a son. He's nothing but a son
[1:25:33] because he's born a son. But if he's not
[1:25:35] obedient and the right kind of son, he
[1:25:37] just continues a son on out without any
[1:25:41] reward.
[1:25:43] This is where this is why I said in the
[1:25:45] beginning, we have the subject of
[1:25:46] adoption. And some people may say, "No,
[1:25:47] I'm just going to leave it alone." And I
[1:25:48] think sometimes that's great. But when
[1:25:50] you recognize what brother Brandon was
[1:25:52] connected to this greater truth that a
[1:25:53] son of God is going to have to answer
[1:25:55] for his for his responsibility, it helps
[1:25:57] us to understand just exactly where to
[1:25:59] place it
[1:26:01] because he refers to it as no reward.
[1:26:03] What's being drawn on? The principle of
[1:26:05] faithfulness. The principle of
[1:26:06] fruitfulness being rewarded. The fact
[1:26:08] that God has given you a potential,
[1:26:10] given you gifts, asked you to do certain
[1:26:12] things. And what have you done with what
[1:26:13] I gave you? Can we try to go quickly
[1:26:15] here? Luke chapter 19 verses 12 to 26.
[1:26:18] We'll skip around a little bit. This is
[1:26:20] the parable that Jesus uses. A certain
[1:26:22] noble man went into a far country. I'm
[1:26:24] using this just to reinforce the idea of
[1:26:25] a lost crown or lost rewards a a in the
[1:26:28] context of faithfulness in a position
[1:26:31] being judged for promotion in placing
[1:26:34] within a new kingdom. Certain noble men
[1:26:35] went into a far country to receive for
[1:26:37] himself a kingdom a new kingdom a new
[1:26:38] domain and to return and he called his
[1:26:41] 10 servants and delivered them 10
[1:26:43] pounds. So each one got a pound and said
[1:26:45] unto them so if you notice that each one
[1:26:47] got the same
[1:26:49] right? So there there's no excuse, maybe
[1:26:52] I'm venturing a little bit, but there's
[1:26:53] no excuse to say, "Well, he got the co
[1:26:56] Holy Ghost and I got a Holy Ghost."
[1:26:58] Right? He got the Holy Spirit and you
[1:27:00] gave me the Holy Ghost, right? I heard
[1:27:02] one somebody say one time, there's a
[1:27:04] distinction, right? Like, well, just
[1:27:06] show me one place where brother labored
[1:27:08] on that distinction, right? So, we don't
[1:27:10] have this excuse. He just he says, "I've
[1:27:12] given you all pounds." And he said to
[1:27:13] them, "Occupy till I come." That's just
[1:27:15] an aside. I don't know that it
[1:27:17] necessarily it fits within what Jesus is
[1:27:19] trying to say. occupy till I come is
[1:27:22] carry on my business,
[1:27:24] right? Do my work, occupy, stay busy.
[1:27:27] Doesn't mean put up a bunch of tents in
[1:27:29] downtown Phoenix and occupy downtown
[1:27:31] Phoenix. It's it it's not it's not this
[1:27:34] laziness and cabbage down on something.
[1:27:36] Stay busy,
[1:27:37] right?
[1:27:38] Do my work. Finish my work. Right?
[1:27:41] I'm gone. I got a job to do. You've seen
[1:27:42] what I've done here. You've seen what
[1:27:43] I've started. I got to go away to
[1:27:44] prepare a kingdom. So, while I'm gone,
[1:27:46] will you finish my work? Right?
[1:27:48] And here's 10 pounds to do it.
[1:27:51] Verse 15. And it came to pass when he
[1:27:53] was returned, having received the
[1:27:56] kingdom, then he commanded these
[1:27:57] servants to be called unto him this day
[1:27:58] of reckoning. To whom he had given the
[1:28:01] money, that he might know how much every
[1:28:03] man had gained by trading. That's gained
[1:28:04] by work and by busying themselves with
[1:28:07] what he had been given. So there's
[1:28:08] increase. Then came the first saint,
[1:28:10] Lord, thy pound. I love it. Your pound.
[1:28:16] He didn't say, "Uh, my pound." He said,
[1:28:18] "Your pound. I only have this. I only
[1:28:20] had this buying power because of you,
[1:28:22] and I only multiplied it because of you.
[1:28:24] Thy pound hath gained 10 pounds." And he
[1:28:26] said, "Well, thou good servant, because
[1:28:28] thou hast been faithful in very little,
[1:28:30] have thou authority over 10 cities."
[1:28:34] So, there's a reward in the new kingdom
[1:28:36] that's greater than what he had and what
[1:28:38] he was given. and what he whatever
[1:28:39] whatever benefit he had in that kingdom
[1:28:42] as he now transitions to a new kingdom.
[1:28:44] It's not just pounds, it's cities.
[1:28:46] It's not even the same expression or
[1:28:48] manifestation. Whatever it looked like
[1:28:49] then that one comm see if someone said,
[1:28:52] "Oh, we've got this new ruler. He's the
[1:28:54] one that's over 10 cities." Man, who was
[1:28:56] this guy? What did he do in the other
[1:28:57] kingdom? He was given a pound.
[1:29:00] Like he was a piggy bank. Like he I
[1:29:03] don't know what he did with it, but he
[1:29:04] he multiplied it 10fold.
[1:29:06] or you know it's like yeah I don't know
[1:29:09] whatever that means. Okay. I uh it just
[1:29:13] it I think there's something to be
[1:29:14] thought about in this. The way Jesus is
[1:29:17] trying to make this end. It should cause
[1:29:19] someone to say, "Wait a minute. One
[1:29:21] pound becomes 10 10 cities." I love
[1:29:23] God's math. And verse 20. Now, we're
[1:29:26] going to skip because this is where I
[1:29:27] want you to see the losing crowns. And
[1:29:29] another came saying, "Lord, behold, here
[1:29:31] is thy pound which I have kept laid up
[1:29:33] in a napkin. For I feared thee because
[1:29:36] thou art an austere man." You know, he's
[1:29:38] harsh. which is very strict. Thou takest
[1:29:40] up that thou layest not down and reapest
[1:29:42] that thou didest not so. So whatever he
[1:29:45] thought about the nature of God, his
[1:29:48] response instead of being like, oh then
[1:29:51] I want to please him,
[1:29:53] right?
[1:29:54] Or this is what God would expect of me,
[1:29:55] he actually works the opposite.
[1:29:58] What what a challenge to not mess this
[1:30:01] up, right? To get this principle right.
[1:30:04] Wherefore then gavest not thou my money.
[1:30:06] So he said never, sorry I judged I
[1:30:08] skipped it. Verse 22. And now here's the
[1:30:10] response. Out of thine own mouth will I
[1:30:13] judge thee.
[1:30:15] Thou wicked servant. So he's as a wicked
[1:30:17] servant or disobedient.
[1:30:20] You knew that I was an austere man by
[1:30:23] your own confession. You knew I took up
[1:30:25] something that I didn't lay down. You
[1:30:27] knew I reap where I didn't even sow.
[1:30:30] So what in the world made you think that
[1:30:31] you should just keep what I gave you and
[1:30:33] hold on for dear life and hope that you
[1:30:35] survive
[1:30:37] wherefore he didn't learn anything right
[1:30:39] didn't learn anything from the tut
[1:30:40] didn't learn anything from the master
[1:30:41] didn't learn anything by his own example
[1:30:43] right
[1:30:44] you by your own confession knew my
[1:30:46] nature but it never became your own
[1:30:50] wherefore then thou gavest not thy money
[1:30:51] into the bank that at my coming I might
[1:30:53] have required my own with usery like
[1:30:55] there was a minimum you could have done
[1:30:57] and you didn't even do that and he said
[1:30:59] unto them that stood by
[1:31:03] take from him the pound here's the one
[1:31:04] standing there received the pound didn't
[1:31:07] gain anything take from him the pound he
[1:31:10] has and give it to him that hath 10
[1:31:12] pounds so that's why I I resist the
[1:31:14] notion to try to make the pound the Holy
[1:31:16] Ghost because I don't think that's what
[1:31:17] Jesus is trying to reflect here but it's
[1:31:19] just maybe an aside that we could
[1:31:20] entertain take from him the pound and
[1:31:22] give it to him that have 10 pounds right
[1:31:26] somebody lost something Right?
[1:31:28] And they said unto him, and there's
[1:31:30] different translations that reason that
[1:31:32] maybe this was a bystander listening to
[1:31:34] Jesus said, "But wait a minute, in your
[1:31:36] own story, this guy already has 10."
[1:31:37] Like there's some sort of shock. Others
[1:31:39] observe that Christ uses it in the story
[1:31:41] that they before they went to take
[1:31:44] affirmed you want us to take it from the
[1:31:46] one who already has 10 or take from the
[1:31:49] one who only has one and take that and
[1:31:51] give it to someone who already has 10.
[1:31:54] Now, why would he do it? You know what
[1:31:56] the principle is in corporate structure?
[1:31:58] If you want something done, give it to
[1:31:59] the guy who's the busiest.
[1:32:01] Right? He's the one that's going to get
[1:32:03] it done. And that's exactly maybe not
[1:32:05] exactly, but this is what Jesus is doing
[1:32:06] here as he says, you know what? I gave
[1:32:09] you one and you you didn't do anything
[1:32:10] with it. Give it to the guy who turned
[1:32:12] that to 10. I could trust him.
[1:32:16] I could trust him. For I say unto you,
[1:32:18] as they said, Lord, he hath 10 pounds.
[1:32:20] Why would you do it? So he says, I say
[1:32:21] to you that unto everyone which hath
[1:32:23] shall be given. He that has gained shall
[1:32:26] receive more. But from him that did not
[1:32:28] gain, even that he that what he could
[1:32:30] have gained or what he should have
[1:32:31] gained, should have used for gain shall
[1:32:33] be taken away from him.
[1:32:36] The servant kept what he received. Catch
[1:32:38] that.
[1:32:40] What he was given,
[1:32:43] give it to the one he had. He he he get
[1:32:46] he get he was able to keep what he had
[1:32:48] received. And now it's being taken from
[1:32:50] the one who didn't gain. He says give
[1:32:52] it.
[1:32:54] So there was not only did you get to
[1:32:55] keep what you received and you had gain,
[1:32:58] you got to keep the 10 what you received
[1:33:00] and the gain and you're rewarded for it.
[1:33:05] It wasn't like awesome, you gained 10
[1:33:07] pounds, keep it, go in. It was like you
[1:33:09] gained 10 pounds, there's more. That's
[1:33:11] the principle.
[1:33:13] So this is one there was a loss. Did we
[1:33:16] I don't know did we have that scripture
[1:33:17] up there? I don't know if I was using
[1:33:19] losing crowns there, but there's a loss
[1:33:21] unto him which hath shall be given from
[1:33:23] him that hath not even that he hath
[1:33:24] shall be taken away from him.
[1:33:28] In the sermon, hear ye him, brother Bam
[1:33:30] says the father, because this is where
[1:33:31] he did this in the presence of of
[1:33:32] people. This is kind of the image of
[1:33:34] that day of reckoning and that ivory
[1:33:35] stare and this time when rewards are
[1:33:37] given out and crowns are given out. The
[1:33:38] father, this is brother Bam using the
[1:33:40] type of the process of adoption in the
[1:33:42] natural. The father taking him out into
[1:33:44] a public place and set him up before the
[1:33:46] public. the son as it was in um in the
[1:33:50] natural. His same son that had been born
[1:33:52] in his family years before
[1:33:56] all the time his son but his character
[1:34:00] and his conduct had brought him to
[1:34:02] another office. Isn't
[1:34:04] that beautiful? Here it is as it's
[1:34:07] expressed here in Luke chapter 19. He
[1:34:09] was a servant. He was given
[1:34:10] responsibility. He was laboring. He's
[1:34:11] working within within the framework of
[1:34:14] what the master required of him. But his
[1:34:16] character and his conduct brought him
[1:34:18] into another office. You're not just
[1:34:21] looking after a pound. You're not just
[1:34:23] trying to exchange exchange money. I'm
[1:34:25] now giving you authority over 10 cities.
[1:34:28] Amen.
[1:34:28] There was an expansion of stewardship.
[1:34:30] There was a greater degree that yes, you
[1:34:32] may have been brother said, "Yeah, you
[1:34:34] are my son. Yes, I gave you authority.
[1:34:35] You used my name. You used what was
[1:34:37] available to you. You used all these
[1:34:39] different things. But now the time comes
[1:34:41] when your character and your conduct
[1:34:43] brings you into another office. Amen.
[1:34:45] He says in the sermon, "Hear ye him. He
[1:34:47] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:34:49] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:34:51] and shall never come into judgment, but
[1:34:53] pass from death unto life."
[1:34:56] There's the scripture. John 5:24. So
[1:34:58] you're still a son and daughter, but
[1:35:00] you're living under your privilege.
[1:35:03] What a way of lifting us up.
[1:35:06] What a way of lifting us up instead of
[1:35:07] saying, you know what, by virtue of the
[1:35:09] fact that you're living below your
[1:35:10] privilege proves that you're not
[1:35:11] privileged. I know privilege is kind of
[1:35:13] a trigger word these days, but say the
[1:35:15] very fact that you're living below it
[1:35:16] proves you don't got it,
[1:35:18] right?
[1:35:19] So, what you need to do is get it,
[1:35:20] right?
[1:35:21] How do I earn a privilege? How it turns
[1:35:24] everything upside down by virtue of the
[1:35:26] gift. You're living below your
[1:35:27] privilege.
[1:35:29] You're living below your potential. He
[1:35:31] says, "So, you're still a son and
[1:35:32] daughter, but you're living under your
[1:35:33] privilege. and your conduct each day as
[1:35:36] the Holy Spirit brings it before the
[1:35:38] father gives away the things that you do
[1:35:40] and you're still a son and daughter but
[1:35:43] you'll never be brought to the place
[1:35:44] where you should be.
[1:35:47] The one came to another office. Now he's
[1:35:48] saying you'll never be brought to the
[1:35:50] place that you should be. You lose
[1:35:51] something. Brother Brham just before he
[1:35:53] makes this statement says I won't say
[1:35:54] you'll be lost.
[1:35:56] And he uses the scripture. He says I'm
[1:35:58] not saying you'll be lost.
[1:36:00] You've passed from death and life.
[1:36:01] You're not going to come before white
[1:36:02] throne judgment. You're his child.
[1:36:03] you're his son. Now, people may want to
[1:36:05] debate what it means to be born again.
[1:36:07] They may want to debate whether or not
[1:36:08] you actually are sealed with the Holy
[1:36:09] Ghost if you have eternal life. A and
[1:36:11] let them debate because you know what?
[1:36:13] We don't have to answer that question.
[1:36:14] The Lord's already answered it,
[1:36:15] right? Leave Leave that to um the Slack
[1:36:17] channels for ministers, right? Just let
[1:36:19] them let them hash that out uh so that
[1:36:21] they can faithfully preach it to to
[1:36:23] their churches. But there's a brother
[1:36:25] Brandham saying you you've got it.
[1:36:27] According to John chapter 5, you've got
[1:36:28] it. You're sealed. And he says, "But
[1:36:30] you'll never come to the place that you
[1:36:32] should be. Never fully enjoy all the
[1:36:35] privileges available to you. I won't say
[1:36:36] you're lost because you're not, but your
[1:36:39] conduct each day is going to determine
[1:36:41] whether or not you're brought to the
[1:36:42] place you should be."
[1:36:46] So, as he mentions the the the tutor
[1:36:48] coming back before the father and giving
[1:36:49] a report, Hebrews 12:es 5-11, I think I
[1:36:53] may just read to verse 7. I I need to
[1:36:56] refer to this. This is my kind of my uh
[1:36:59] sprint now. So, you've taken you've
[1:37:01] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:37:03] unto you as unto children. My son,
[1:37:05] despise not the chastening of the Lord.
[1:37:08] Don't despise it, nor faint when thou
[1:37:10] art rebuked of him.
[1:37:12] Don't be discouraged.
[1:37:14] Don't question your sunship.
[1:37:17] Don't use God's correction and God
[1:37:19] dealing with you as a son as the
[1:37:21] evidence that you're not a son. It
[1:37:22] doesn't make any sense. Don't despise
[1:37:25] the chastening of the Lord, nor faint
[1:37:26] when thou art rebuked of him. For whom
[1:37:27] the Lord loveth, he chastneth and
[1:37:30] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
[1:37:33] If you endure chastening,
[1:37:36] God dealeth with you as with sons. For
[1:37:39] what son is he whom the father
[1:37:40] chasteneth not?
[1:37:42] Why does he chasten you? What's the
[1:37:44] purpose of the suffering? What's the
[1:37:45] purpose of the repetition? Could we not
[1:37:47] agree? And I don't necessarily like to
[1:37:49] use uh strict logic and things like
[1:37:51] this, but if we just all agreed that we
[1:37:53] were sealed with the Holy Ghost, we're
[1:37:55] completely sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:57] and that we're going to be in the first
[1:37:58] resurrection, whether by resurrection
[1:38:00] from a grave or changed in a moment of
[1:38:01] twinkling of an eye, we're going to be
[1:38:02] there in eternity, everything's ours,
[1:38:04] everything's finished. Then does the
[1:38:07] rest of your life seem kind of odd to
[1:38:08] you,
[1:38:10] right? Like why' you just why'd you
[1:38:13] leave me here? Why did you save me and
[1:38:16] give me perfect discernment and the
[1:38:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost a and a
[1:38:18] perfect character and a perfect seal and
[1:38:20] everything's great and fine and dandy
[1:38:22] and I got to go listen to a guy drone on
[1:38:24] and on and on that later on falls away
[1:38:26] and proves he never had the Holy Ghost
[1:38:27] and there I was sitting there fully
[1:38:28] sealed and had to listen to this
[1:38:29] knucklehead for a while.
[1:38:31] Right? There's a party that begs the
[1:38:33] question, what are we doing here? And
[1:38:34] someone said, "Well, brother Aaron,
[1:38:35] there's more more souls to be saved."
[1:38:36] Well, what are we doing here? Let's go
[1:38:37] get them.
[1:38:38] Right.
[1:38:40] Right. I mean, like all of a sudden we
[1:38:41] it just things start to be like, "Wow,
[1:38:43] that's a good question. maybe we
[1:38:44] shouldn't have church. Maybe we should
[1:38:45] just do street revivals and get people
[1:38:47] to confess and and we just need to get
[1:38:48] as many people in as we possibly can.
[1:38:52] But then when you realize that there's
[1:38:53] life after this one that's never going
[1:38:54] to end,
[1:38:55] right?
[1:38:56] There's a thousand-year millennial reign
[1:38:57] that God's going to need you
[1:38:59] to bind unbelief
[1:39:02] for a thousand years.
[1:39:05] And perfect character is going to rule
[1:39:06] and reign over his possession.
[1:39:09] And the bride with the bride is part of
[1:39:11] this. Oh, there's more.
[1:39:14] Then then this is this is a proving
[1:39:15] ground for that eternity. Yes,
[1:39:18] if you want to use those words. This is
[1:39:19] what it's all about. This is why we come
[1:39:21] to church. This is why I believe every
[1:39:22] service is important.
[1:39:24] Is because we're not just engaged in
[1:39:26] filling up your calendar. We're not just
[1:39:27] checking the box because we have
[1:39:28] attendance. We're doing it because we
[1:39:30] know that something's going to be
[1:39:31] required of us. We do it because we know
[1:39:33] this is a house of correction. Brother
[1:39:35] Bram says our judgment begins here by
[1:39:37] the word. He's judging us here. and this
[1:39:39] this correcting us. He's doing as the
[1:39:41] Bible says for our profit that we might
[1:39:43] be partakers of his holiness.
[1:39:47] He's doing it for our amendment. And he
[1:39:50] says when we labor, Paul says, for when
[1:39:51] we labor that whether present or absent
[1:39:54] when he comes, we may be accepted and
[1:39:56] approved of him. We're laboring whether
[1:39:58] we go in a rapture while we're alive or
[1:39:59] whether we go by way of the grave, we're
[1:40:00] laboring that we might be approved by
[1:40:02] him that we would not be a castaway. For
[1:40:04] we must all appear before the judgment
[1:40:06] seat of Christ. Every son and daughter
[1:40:08] of God will have to stand before him in
[1:40:10] this seemingly public display of honor
[1:40:13] and glory and praise given to his
[1:40:14] servants that everyone may receive the
[1:40:16] things done in his body according to
[1:40:17] that he hath done whether it be good or
[1:40:19] bad. I may be finishing the series right
[1:40:21] now. It's very possible that this might
[1:40:23] be this this summation in my heart to
[1:40:26] this very thing because it's such a
[1:40:27] beautiful framework to finish this in.
[1:40:28] He's saying that there's a great there's
[1:40:30] a grant of reward that is proportional
[1:40:32] to the things done. Right?
[1:40:36] And I know we start thinking
[1:40:37] proportional. One pound became 10
[1:40:39] cities.
[1:40:42] So it may not be our logic of fairness.
[1:40:43] It may not be what we're proportional to
[1:40:45] us. You may look at a someone who has
[1:40:47] pastor a church that never got bigger
[1:40:48] than 68 people for decades.
[1:40:51] Right?
[1:40:51] And their reward is greater than the one
[1:40:53] who ended up pasing pastoring tens of
[1:40:55] thousands of people over decades but
[1:40:56] never more than a couple hundred.
[1:40:58] Right.
[1:40:58] Right. Like there's the things that we
[1:41:00] we do these scales who preached the most
[1:41:02] meetings and who's this and who's that.
[1:41:03] We have these scales of fairness and
[1:41:05] exponentiality and it's proportional.
[1:41:07] But notice God's way of multiplying.
[1:41:11] But Paul is saying we labor so that we
[1:41:14] can be approved
[1:41:15] for a reward.
[1:41:17] Brother B said every man will have to
[1:41:19] answer for his talent.
[1:41:21] God gives men talent. They have to use
[1:41:24] it.
[1:41:29] I'll invite our the brothers to come the
[1:41:31] musicians and in doing so for some they
[1:41:33] have arbitrarily created a stopping
[1:41:35] point and I'm short of two hours
[1:41:40] in the sermon spiritual adoption. I I
[1:41:43] almost read this at the beginning but I
[1:41:45] knew what you would say is you should
[1:41:46] have stopped there so I've saved it to
[1:41:49] the end. The sermon spiritual adoption.
[1:41:51] Let's just all focus. I know it's it's
[1:41:54] hot in here.
[1:41:56] Uh maybe stuffy.
[1:41:59] Uh trust me, I don't like the sound of
[1:42:01] my own voice after a while.
[1:42:04] In the sermon spiritual adoption, he's
[1:42:06] talking about how his father, because we
[1:42:08] just talked about God is our father who
[1:42:09] corrects us, chastens us, reproves us.
[1:42:12] What does he do? Your improvement is in
[1:42:14] mind. He's saying, I want to give you
[1:42:16] everything one day. I want you to have
[1:42:18] it all. I want you to get a full reward.
[1:42:21] Instead of him just invalidating us up,
[1:42:24] he corrects us.
[1:42:25] Even giving us an opportunity at
[1:42:27] redeeming the things that we otherwise
[1:42:28] would have missed.
[1:42:30] As long as you're breathing, I say
[1:42:31] they're available. And brother Brandham
[1:42:34] is talking about his daddy. He says,
[1:42:35] "Well, if I get a chance, I want to hug
[1:42:36] him and I want to thank him for all the
[1:42:37] lashings I got, for all the spankings I
[1:42:39] got." Paul's building on that very
[1:42:40] principle in Hebrews chapter 12. Did I
[1:42:42] not our our own fathers correct us after
[1:42:45] their own pleasure? Re said, "I'll thank
[1:42:47] them for every spanking I got." He says,
[1:42:48] "If I feel that way about my earthly
[1:42:50] father, what will it be that day when we
[1:42:53] stand in his presence and we see the
[1:42:55] things happen to us for our good
[1:42:58] that had to cut us a little bit here and
[1:43:01] child train us and take off the things
[1:43:03] of the world and make us endure a
[1:43:05] two-hour sermon on Sunday, March 5th,
[1:43:09] and let us walk as humble children
[1:43:11] before him."
[1:43:13] See how I'm working that in there that
[1:43:14] you can just be like, you know, I'm
[1:43:15] going to get something for this one day.
[1:43:17] This will not be wasted. I may have
[1:43:19] burned a brisket, but I'm getting
[1:43:20] something out of this one day.
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:24] He says, "It may seem hard at the
[1:43:26] beginning, but God knows what he's
[1:43:29] doing."
[1:43:30] Sure, he knows what he's doing.
[1:43:34] Oh, trust him.
[1:43:37] Trust him. All your hurts and pains,
[1:43:40] afflictions and sufferings, all your
[1:43:42] perseverance. I don't know what the
[1:43:43] whole point is. There must be a point.
[1:43:45] Trust him. Trust him with everything
[1:43:47] that is in you. It may seem hard and it
[1:43:50] may at the beginning it may seem hard
[1:43:52] now and it may seem hard all the way to
[1:43:54] the very end, but God knows what he's
[1:43:56] doing with a daughter that he wants to
[1:43:58] give more to. He knows Hallelujah. He
[1:44:01] knows what he put in you.
[1:44:03] He knows what he put in you. He knows
[1:44:06] the value of it. He knows the potential
[1:44:08] of it. And he knows how to get it out of
[1:44:10] you.
[1:44:14] And so he says, "Then as the Holy Spirit
[1:44:16] begins to bring word,
[1:44:18] they capitalize word. It's also drawing
[1:44:20] on the type of the tutor reporting to
[1:44:22] the father and said, "Your son's just
[1:44:23] like you."
[1:44:25] He tells the story of how there was the
[1:44:28] son on the left hand, the son on the
[1:44:30] other hand, the disobedient son, the the
[1:44:31] the son that wasn't a right kind of son.
[1:44:33] The the the father saying, "You know
[1:44:35] what? He does this, he does that, he
[1:44:36] does this, that, he does that." He goes,
[1:44:37] "He can't be adopted. He's not ready to
[1:44:39] be adopted."
[1:44:41] And it's like, man, you know, I was
[1:44:44] really hoping really hoping
[1:44:49] it I I I let me say this. If you want me
[1:44:52] to preach more on the subject, I can do
[1:44:54] it. There's brother Random called it the
[1:44:57] law of adoption in the Old Testament.
[1:44:59] Well, where where do we find it?
[1:45:02] But there's such an absolute clear
[1:45:03] principle in the scripture that
[1:45:05] someone's conduct can knock them out of
[1:45:07] the inheritance. And the father's like,
[1:45:09] "Man, I really wanted to give that to
[1:45:10] you, but I got to give it to somebody
[1:45:11] else." Brother Ram's drawn on that
[1:45:15] because then he says this, "There's this
[1:45:16] other son who demonstrates
[1:45:18] faithfulness." So he said that Holy
[1:45:20] Spirit begins to bring the word, bring
[1:45:21] word. Then if the child has not been
[1:45:23] obedient, when it becomes of maturity,
[1:45:25] to the age of maturity, a time appointed
[1:45:28] of the father, a juncture, a moment in
[1:45:30] time where he ought to receive it. This
[1:45:33] is the point when you should be
[1:45:34] teachers. This is the point where you
[1:45:36] ought to be doing more. your
[1:45:37] stewardship's expanded maybe some sort
[1:45:39] of escalation more authority given or
[1:45:41] ultimately that time when you ought to
[1:45:42] fully receive legally the kingdom he
[1:45:45] says that the Holy Spirit brings word
[1:45:47] when he comes to maturity the age of
[1:45:48] maturity then the child is always a son
[1:45:50] certainly but it loses something
[1:45:54] this is what we could take away from
[1:45:55] this what you call losing crowns there's
[1:45:59] we say it loses something but can we not
[1:46:02] recognize there's something to gain
[1:46:06] this This is why this teaching is so
[1:46:07] important and it makes sense. And though
[1:46:09] he so he transitions. He says that it
[1:46:11] loses something. Do you get it? It loses
[1:46:13] something.
[1:46:15] So he says, "And here's a point that I
[1:46:16] want to drive home. May the Holy Spirit
[1:46:19] take it to every heart of you believers.
[1:46:22] Just because you are a believer,
[1:46:24] certainly you have everlasting life."
[1:46:26] God said so. But would you want to just
[1:46:28] go in as Job said, by the skin of your
[1:46:30] teeth?
[1:46:33] Would you just want to be saved as if by
[1:46:35] fire?
[1:46:37] Would you just want to come before the
[1:46:39] father and the talent that he's given
[1:46:42] every one of you as being negligent?
[1:46:49] You just didn't use it or you let
[1:46:52] something else stand in your way. This
[1:46:54] is on the subject of adoption. And he
[1:46:57] said that you'll have to stand before
[1:46:58] the father. This is the day of reckoning
[1:47:00] and you're going to answer for what you
[1:47:02] did with this life. It's your character
[1:47:05] that makes the difference. Do you just
[1:47:07] want to come before him with what he
[1:47:08] gave you
[1:47:10] and in type say, "Oh, I didn't want to
[1:47:13] lose it. I didn't want to I I didn't
[1:47:15] want to I didn't want to do something
[1:47:17] with it that I I I was afraid. I was
[1:47:19] afraid to use it."
[1:47:23] It's almost as if the one the others who
[1:47:26] gained
[1:47:28] realized it was a zerorisk proposition
[1:47:33] and that they weren't afraid to fail in
[1:47:36] doing something for Christ.
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:40] And he's he this is can you read read
[1:47:43] that? Let it imprint
[1:47:45] all these things now connecting tying
[1:47:47] in. He says, "You let little petty
[1:47:48] things that meant nothing to you. After
[1:47:51] all, little fusses and stews and
[1:47:52] arguments and church differences take
[1:47:54] the meekness and gentleness from your
[1:47:56] life."
[1:47:58] Still a son,
[1:48:00] but you let life rob you of the the the
[1:48:03] the meekness of Christ. You let you let
[1:48:06] life rob you from the nature of Christ.
[1:48:09] Think about the process, right? He says,
[1:48:12] "Would you want to stand before the
[1:48:13] father like that?"
[1:48:16] I don't believe you would.
[1:48:20] I don't believe that you would do it.
[1:48:23] Neither would I.
[1:48:26] Do you agree?
[1:48:27] Could it be said of you that you don't
[1:48:29] you don't want to just stand before him
[1:48:30] on that day and go, "Oh, well, I had
[1:48:31] eternal life. Yeah, I was sealed." And
[1:48:34] that there's nothing to show him. That
[1:48:37] is there not something inside of you
[1:48:39] that says, "I don't want to lose a
[1:48:40] crown." You you sister, you may have a
[1:48:43] hundred to gain and I hope you gain them
[1:48:45] all. But if I only have three, I want to
[1:48:46] gain them all.
[1:48:49] So that in the end, the question is
[1:48:51] 100%.
[1:48:52] That's what I want. I want 100%.
[1:48:55] That whatever God has for me, that's
[1:48:57] what I want to fulfill.
[1:48:59] And there's brother Benam uses a a an
[1:49:02] interesting subject in the law. He uses
[1:49:04] a a a mystery even in the Old Testament,
[1:49:07] if I could put it that way. He uses
[1:49:08] these different examples drawing from
[1:49:10] relationships and and legal inheritance
[1:49:13] and processes and all these different
[1:49:15] things to merely try to impress upon the
[1:49:18] believer that to be secure in your
[1:49:20] relationship with Christ. Be certain
[1:49:23] that you have identified with him that
[1:49:26] you have his life. You have his nature.
[1:49:28] And now what he wants to do is he wants
[1:49:31] to grow you into his image. And he wants
[1:49:33] you to come to the place of rapturing
[1:49:36] grace. And he wants you to come to your
[1:49:38] position. Wherever you are in the
[1:49:40] dispensation, wherever you are in your
[1:49:42] age, whatever he's called you to do,
[1:49:44] whether it be a housewife, whether it be
[1:49:46] a missionary, whether it be a mechanic,
[1:49:48] whatever it is, I am expressing what God
[1:49:51] has given me. And it's multiplying and
[1:49:53] it's multiplying and I will suffer and I
[1:49:57] will conduct myself and I'll restrain
[1:49:59] myself not merely for the praise itself,
[1:50:02] but knowing that God has a reward for
[1:50:05] me. Amen.
[1:50:07] And even if it be the sense that I don't
[1:50:11] want to lose something,
[1:50:13] brother Brandham was not afraid to
[1:50:15] present that in his teaching. That if
[1:50:18] there's crowns to be gained, there's
[1:50:20] crowns to be lost.
[1:50:23] Let's not lose any of them.
[1:50:26] I don't believe you would want to,
[1:50:29] and neither would I.
[1:50:33] Let's stand.
