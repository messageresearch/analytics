TRANSCRIPT
========================================
romans chapter 2 i feel very pressed just to jump right into the word and um have a lot um before me and i need you so i need your help definitely need your help today romans chapter 2 verse 12. for as many as have sinned without law shall perish without law and as many have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law and then this phrase is parenthetical it's kind of inserted in here to clarify and give further understanding to how the gentiles and jews are being brought in to the glory of god for not the hearers of the law are just before god which israel they were the ones that heard the law but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law the law was not sent to them do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts in the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel and that kind of amplifies or bookends the statement for as many have sinned without the law shall perish and as many have sinned in the law shall be judged in the day when god shall judge by the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel if you have a need today before we approach the lord in prayer would you just make it known if lifting your hands to him do so in faith believing that he can speak particularly to your need today i want you to take it personal today in a good way god wants to speak to you that god's mindful of your situation uh and can bring a great healing and deliverance wherever that you need it so just be very individualistic today to believe god i know you have something for me our gracious heavenly fathers we stand in your divine presence we have an assurance that transcends written paper and signed contracts and verbal promises we have something that so resonates deep within our bo our souls lord that it it becomes a fabric in every part of our lives and lord i pray today that as we have gathered together and so many are here to to be in fellowship and to hear the word of god i ask that you would come honoring their faith meeting their expectations exceeding their expectations and doing things which we do not even know what to utter and what to ask for but may the spirit just begin to groan within us and pull and and even lord if it need to be a painful desire and an agonizing that our faith grabs a hold of and and just is so perseverant lord to hear from you may it be so may we just have this doggedness about us today where just as the world is unrelenting and just as the sin and politics and all the things of this world do not let up and it's just so aggressive and uh and assertive lord may we be bold today father just to apprehend to grasp to enter in or to even think that jesus said that the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force lord i believe that we must be in some measure in some way violent to seize upon to lay a hold to desire and to seek after and may we have that kind of disposition today lord as we approach this word that we have not gathered traditionally we have not come just to appease a carnal conscience but lord we've come drawn by your spirit with a longing and a desire to hear from you and i pray you'd speak grant it now father we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you may be seated we're continuing on the subject of pure joy and my title today or subtitle is a clean conscience and this will be um i see since we're kind of starting maybe a new focus this service might just be a matter of trying to get a lot of building materials out there and hopefully laying a bit of a foundation so there might just be a lot of things that we're plugging in here just to kind of kick start the burden and kind of put us in the in the channel of the subject of a clean conscience the pure joy it is the lord's joy that he gives us i was even pondering the statement of nehemiah how that and studying in the book of nehemiah and that's kind of what i've been looking at but i can't seem to quite get there how it says that the joy of the lord is your strength and it struck me a little bit differently to think the lord's joy is a strength to us what pleases him what what satisfies him what makes him happy but the so our pure joy is the lord's joy that he gives to us it's something that's very personal and it's a joy that we ought to guard it's a joy that we ought to cherish it's a joy that we should seek and we looking at the statement where brother branham is talking about god's elect of love and how he proved his love for us and love is based upon election and he makes this statement how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said we can do that and by conducting myself with joy admits the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass and we realize there's the rub there's the hard part we can believe we believe what he says even by faith that he's given us so we believe what he says but conducting ourselves above temptation conducting ourselves above trial conducting ourselves on a different level spiritually and emotionally than all the circumstances and symptoms around us that's that's the challenge and the proof of our love the proof of his love is an election that he said he loved us and he sent his son to die for us now there is a proof or reciprocation of our love it's faith in his word and then conduct the manner in which we conduct ourselves and it must be with joy in the middle of all trials because when he says the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass is not a qualifier of trials but it's letting us know that any trial he has in his wisdom allowed to come to pass and really that's the beginning of joy then if you can have confidence that he has allowed it in his wisdom and so as brother branham is making these making this point in this particular place in the church age book the key to a joyful disposition is connected with god's elective love and this is a revelation that we ought to desire to continually unfold a revelation of his love let's not look at it as just an instance where we feel his love our moment when he tells us he loves us but it's a revelation that can continually unfold and get more rich and more strong unto us in first john chapter 4 verses 18 and 19 it says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear now instead of approaching this as a an evidence that if you have fear you don't have perfect love look at it as the perfect love that you have received from him and the perfect love you have by the baptist the holy ghost is meant to conquer fear it's meant to cast it out perfect love casteth out fear so you're availing yourself to the characteristics and qualities of perfect love because fear hath torment so why does perfect love cast out fear why is it a set against fear because fear brings torment and how can we enjoy relationship how can we joy existence if there's fear he that feareth is not made perfect in love in other words the perfect love has not perfected you has not brought you its wholeness and its completeness as it is designed to and says we love him because he first loved us and so our love is birth for him as birth from our understanding that he first loved us so if our the intensity of our love for him is going to be directly connected to the revelation of the intensity of the love that he has for us okay and maybe i'll just use arbitrary numbers it's not to say that god has a scale and he says i love you to a seven but if we have the understanding that god that god loves us and it's to the it's to the three well then we're we're not gonna be able to love them back at a 5. you're not going to be able to say well god i love you more we can do that in our games right in our human relationship and be hard on ourselves we can ask god show me how much you love me show me how much you care lord i believe you do but i want to understand it better i want to know it better and to be more confident in his love can actually take the power away from weaknesses and complexes and inefficiencies because you realize he loves me despite it we're not constantly trying to gain his approval and gain his affection and and gain his seal like say oh no i like you you're good enough there's a way that the gospel can be preached for trying to merit and earn the baptism of the holy ghost and it completely changes the whole nature of god's relationship with you and so perfect love is designed to ultimately overthrow fear that its nature is to ultimately overthrow fear otherwise we would not be able to rest otherwise we would not be able to trust as we ministered a couple services on victory ahead is victory now the thought was and this is i really hate to try to summarize it because there's just so much that was behind the statement victory had his victory now but it was the idea of anchoring our faith in something beyond the temporal that we're anchored in something that is eternal so we're not so much rooted in the things that are around us but we're rooted in something beyond us and this statement in colossians colossians chapter 1 verse 5 is just so thrilling to me for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof you have heard before in the word of truth of the truth of the gospel for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven there is a hope which is laid up for us in heaven where have you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel and so your confident hope your expectation your joyful disposition is born from experiencing what heaven holds for you because it says it's a hope which is laid up for you in heaven but you've heard it you've experienced it to some degree you've you've fellowshipped with it it's been revealed to you so there is a hope that um that that your ex there's a hope that we have and a joyful anticipation of the future not because we've merely been told it exists but we're experiencing it you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and so as the word as it says that you've heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel the word of truth is never just statistics the word of truth is never data alone it's never just information but it is something that's living it is something that's eternal it's something that you're a part of and that is going to form the basis of your joy that i'm connected to something eternal now these are just some uh kind of review some things that are just to review and first john chapter 3 verses 20 and 21 i want to just share this before we launch into our subject of um a pure conscience it says in first john chapter 3 verses 20 to 21 for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart so don't be condemned because you have a condemned heart it's amazing how our feelings can pile on where you know we we we feel like we've disappointed the lord and we can feel and we feel bad for disappointing him and we were forgiven for the disappointment but now we need to be forgiven for feeling bad that we disappointed him and it just creates this unending cycle right so he's just trying to let's just snip it in the bud let's just get it over with if our heart condemns us god's greater than that and it's connected with his knowledge of all things so you may think you know more than he does but his knowledge of all things and even what he doesn't know ought to overthrow anything you know because he knows all things and and what he retains and what he knows and his foreknowledge and his election based upon that and his predestination working together for that that's what we're grounded in that's what we're rooted in if our heart condemns us it means if our heart finds fault if it has if it's blaming us if it's accusing us look to him who's greater than your heart and knows more than your heart does beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards god he's not saying that if you have a condemned heart you don't have confidence he's saying that if we our confidence in god ought to take our hearts that are condemned and free us from condemnation if our hearts condemn us then that if our hearts condemn us not then that's what confidence in god ought to produce if we fear don't oh i don't have perfect love because i'm fearful no perfect love will cast out that so we believe and look to perfect love will cast out this fear if my heart's condemned then we say my conf i trust god i believe in god then my confidence in god will manifest itself in uncondemning my heart overthrow and condemnation i know that he has a perfect love for me well maybe i just need to ask the question do you believe god loves you do you believe that his love is imperfect then if he loves you with an imperfect love if we could settle that that he loves you perfectly then that perfect love cast out fear it's it's not your human ability to love perfectly that's going to cast out fear if you say well perfect love cast out fear therefore i'm i don't have perfect love and that's why i'm fearful no it's his perfect love that cast out fear it's your confidence in god which is going to overthrow a condemned heart so we need to start thinking about it backwards instead of these being a litmus test about whether or not you love god and whether or not you believe god and whether or not he's you're really elect you ought to look at it as no these are my rights as the elect this is my right as one that believes god this is my right as one that has confidence in god this is my ultimate destiny as one who is the recipient of a god who loves me perfectly a beneficiary of a god who loves perfectly so you completely change the whole approach and so this is the condemning heart this is kind of where i'm starting to enter into this thought of a clean conscience this a condemned heart a heart holds some sort of knowledge or consciousness of something that is to our detriment or that is used to overthrow our confidence so it's something that plagues us or something that lowers us causing us to droop or or to hang down it's a source of anxiety or apprehension so there's a lot of emotions that are birthed by a condemned heart and so when we were looking at the subject of being numb it was about the ability or the inability to feel emotions and to become emotionalist and very stayed and not just a soberness or somberness but actually a numbness to where you're stoic and unmoved and we were identifying how that god will use our emotions to get our and so i i kind of wanted to pick up on that to focus to better understand what this pure joy is and and just by recalling some of those things how that pure joy is inaccessible if you have don't have the ability to experience emotions if we cannot and pure joy is not accessible to us if we're not um without first addressing uncomfortable feelings feelings of discomfort and feelings that may not make us feel good and what we've been looking at is this thought of inversion not so much well how can i get pure joy or what is pure joy but what keeps us from it and so a clear conscience this is necessary to have and it is necessary to fully experience it's necessary to have it's necessary to have a clean conscience uh in order to have pure joy it's necessary to have a clean conscience in order to fully experience the lord's joy and there's a statement that i've been reading and pondering over the last month or so in the church age book and i believe it's around the 40th paragraph or so i forgot to or page 41 in there it says our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real that nice you just claim it our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord this is a this is a state of being that we ought to decide desire to live and fully within our spirit is clean our spirit is fresh our spirit is real our spirit is sober and serious but nonetheless it is full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures in other words church services should be far more joyful and uplifting than a trump rally right joy is the flag flowing high i mean that that ought to be how our our lives are conducted that it's it's more than these athletic competitions it's more than the concerts it's more than the rallies and the gatherings and the protests and the marches and and the things the demonstrations the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures now i i'm going to say this now and just realizing maybe this channel is opening up uh to be very direct in this way because i'm wanting to come to a thought towards the very end of this about where the world's current state is and its emotions and its feelings and its awareness and as the christians and it just hits me so heavily now the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is in it when it savors and delights in its pleasures and the world is always going to be exuberant and delight and rejoice in and celebrate and be very excited about its pleasures but the detriment of the world has been the christian losing its joy in the things of the lord and what it's created is a an arena in which the the the religious are competing with the ungodly in fervency and intensity and who can be pro-this and anti-vat and it's completely left the arena of what the gospel is for and so the christian ought to be exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord both christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love our ambitions our zeal our enthusiasm is purely on the lord of glory and his love this is a this is a check to us this is a balance this is something we begin to examine what am i all about what am i excited about what am i pursuing what am i for what what's motivating me what's uh exciting me is are my is my heart and my emotions purely on the lord of glory and his love or something else because it says both christians and the world have emotions and he says that the christians hearts are stayed upon something and focused on something the lord and his love while the world satisfies the flesh joe's just goes to show what a as you ponder that just what a razor's edge it can be before you tip over from the joy of the lord into something that satisfies the flesh it says the world satisfies the flesh so i want to look at this the term conscience conscience it's a noun conscience is a noun it's the faculty of knowing what is right it is the awareness of whether our conduct is in harmony with our conviction of what is right so it's an awareness of whether or not what we're doing comports with or agrees with what we think is right right that's what a conscience is a good way of defining conscience it's what our innermost thoughts something's very deep our thoughts our desires our intentions our feelings and so it's something very very deep within us a faculty of knowing what is right awareness of whether or not our conduct agrees with what we believe is right and so it speaks of our desires and intents and our feelings the latin is consensua which is knowledge within oneself the sense of right and wrong so it has like a moral sense to it the sense of right or wrong we could uh i'll just i'll read another definition a state of awareness or sense that one's actions or intentions are either morally right or morally wrong this is what conscience is is this it's a state of awareness or you sense that what you do or what you intend is correct what i've done is right or what i've done is wrong my intent behind it you could do something and on the surface you know well hey this this this looks good but your conscience tells you your motive is wrong because it's looking at your intent well your reason for doing it that's what conscience is so conscious is your moral basis which guides your behavior you followed me one of you is all right i i i i know that you're i know that you're listening uh very intently and i i i trust it's a good thing because i can i can certainly sense that you're listening but what i don't want it to be is a scenario where it's just so hard to understand me that you've got to really really focus or you'll miss it and it won't be worth your time like i don't want that to be the reason why you're uh um so intent and listening and i remember brother barry coffey shared with me an analogy one time of what it was like to hear me preach and to this day i think he meant it as a compliment he did mean it as a compliment i just in that moment forgot what the analogy was but it's some kind of struggle between life and death that he saw in the in africa somewhere where like a python was wrestling with a with some other beast and it was a matter the first one to slip the first one to lose their attention was going to die and he said that's what it feels like to listen to you preach right okay thank you pastor so our conscience everybody relax now we're not in a death fight here boa constrictor versus you our conscience will stop actions stop us from acting wrong or acting on the wrong desires and our conscience with us don't do that that's the wrong desire that's the wrong motive or our conscience will actually motivate us to do right this this is what our conscience is it's a knowledge within someone within someone it's what is right it's awareness of whether or not what i'm doing is right and awareness that what i've done was for the wrong reasons that's what conscience is so our conscience causes us to feel guilt when we've done wrong our conscious causes us to feel happy when we've done good i'm just going to turn this i if if you don't agree with it if you don't understand i'm not going to force you to say amen and agree but i want this to i want you to kind of grab a hold to be conscious of this now that and our conscience is works this way that we've done something wrong it's our conscience that tells us that's not right and when we've done something good it's our conscience it makes us happy like hey that was the right thing to do i feel good about that and so in john chapter 8 verse 9 as we were looking at this here recently and how that it was in the subject of vietnam how that they brought this woman who had been caught in the act of adultery and somehow in all the religious fervor they forgot about the man and they bring this woman before christ we caught her in the very act of adultery in christ they kind of ignoring him at first and writes upon the ground and then he and he basically says you who are without sin cast the first stone and then and it says and they which heard it being convicted notice this phrase convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even under the least last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst so notice the effect or how a conscience works each one was convicted by their own conscience so everyone has their own conscience and what the conscience did here it actually convicted them and so it's an aspect since we all have our own conscience it's an aspect of our personality that is going to in on an individual level discern what is right or wrong so they were convicted by their own conscience it means their conscience gave them the sense that their actions were wrong their conscience pricked them and they made them to feel well this isn't right just as when peter preached he says and the men they were pricked in their heart they were pricked in their conscience their conscience began to feel like oh we've done something wrong what must we do so a conscience is the sense of that our acts our actions our motives and our intent are either right or they're wrong our conscience can even be this feeling that we have an obligation to act that's what our conscience is and let me say this now before we go further in this because in some on some level i believe the word is kind of just uh describing our human condition and exposing things about our nature but but let me say this very very clear and very definitively about our conscience our conscience must correctly be formed by divine revelation our this is this is where many of us are as believers and this is how we ought to be uh we have to be motivated and raised in our children and how that we teach and how that we would want to witness our conscience can only correctly be formed by divine revelation so that we can do right for the right reasons our conscience has got to be formed by the revelation of god's word so that we can will to do right and then do it for the right reasons it's very important for us to understand that there's a way that revelation forms then our conscience now in our text in romans chapter 2 verses 13 to 15 and we're just carving out the middle piece to that the parenthetical phrase there's going to come a time when god's going to judge all the thoughts of men's hearts those that were without the law and those who are with the law both jew and gentile is where he's what he's looking at then he says for the he that hears of the law for not the hearers it's not just the years of the law or israel that are just before god those that hear and have been given the law and to whom the law pertained but the doers of the law shall be justified those that do and fulfill the intent of the law are justified for when the gentiles which have not the law they're not beneficiaries of the law they weren't given the law and even when the gospel was brought to them they were not brought to the law they were brought to grace and that there was a mixing and a blending and a hybrid of judaism with christianity that was trying to take a gentile who is to receive grace and make them subject to the law and so the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these when they do what's in the law when they fulfill the law when they're walking according to the thoughts and the intent of the law they although they don't have the law are a law unto themselves and then notice how beautiful that is because the law which was what written on tablets of stone something that was written and passed down and even continued to be written and read which shows the work of the law written in their hearts so he said the gentiles don't have it written on tablets now god has done something where it's written within themselves and they have a law that's now working within themselves you see how this is really a theme in the book of romans this law this new law that's inside of them and then he says so not only is the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another it's kind of an interesting picture so it says their conscience this in the greek the word here the the kind of the root and the meaning behind the conscience that's used in the new testament is a persisting notion some thought that's persisting something that's there and it speaks of a moral consciousness something that's present kind of pushing a persistent notion that guides directs and i think maybe in in certain images in in fiction or whatever you have this image of the good angel on the one side and the bad and the devil on the other side and one saying well you shouldn't do that no one said no you should do it now you shouldn't do that in some ways that's you know whether it's the the devil or the angel either one of us a notion a persisting notion something that's guiding you so it says their conscience i want to amplify this a little bit their conscience also bearing witness so conscience we saw in john 8 convicts they were convicted by their own conscience now this conscience says it bears witness in other words their conscience testifies their conscience gives record as i said before that it convicts i mean it's something that is giving record it's something that's witnessing it's something that's uh saying that's good that's bad so their conscience the word is written in their hearts their word is in some some place deep within their souls they say that word now by the new birth is engrafted into the soul you're born again by the word of truth but now your conscience agrees saying this is how that they're living and fulfilling the law their conscience bears witness the jews have a saying that the soul of man witnesses in him that's what paul is referring to now he says it this way of himself in romans chapter 9 verse 1 i say the truth in christ i lie not so he's saying i'm not lying i'm telling the truth and he says my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost so i'm not lying i'm telling the truth my conscience overshadowed by the holy ghost confirms it i'm not being a hypocrite i'm not just telling you one thing and feeling another i speak the truth and as i speak it my own conscience is in harmony with with what i'm saying there's no there's nothing out of place there's nothing just disconcerting i don't feel hypocritical i don't feel two-faced by saying this i don't feel uneasy i don't feel like unrest i'm speaking the truth i'm not lying my own conscience which is overshadowed by the holy ghost and agrees with the holy ghost confirms that what i'm speaking is the truth i'm i'm trying just to amplify a little bit what our conscience is in the scripture so our conscience judges our actions their conscience also bearing witness it judges our actions and it sets as a judge over our thoughts and our feelings assigning to them the moral qualities of phrase of praise or blame or guilt rather i blame more guilt i think either one would work so our conscience sets there and it judges it was judging paul as he spoke and his conscience said you're saying the truth and so our conscience then can praise us or it can cause bring this blame and a sense of guilt he says in second corinthians chapter 1 verse 12 for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom so there's got to be a simplicity and godly sincerity to uh they're rejoicing and the testimony of our conscience by the grace of god we have our we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you word i i think it's a beautiful scripture that's going to deserve more attention than i'm giving these other parts but notice he says the testimony of our conscience when paul says it that my conscience also bearing witness their conscience also bearing witness the testimony of our conscience it means he has nothing on his conscience to or he knows nothing against himself he knows nothing against what he's sharing he knows nothing against what it what his burden is and his desires is so he says my the testimony of my conscience i have a clear conscience i have nothing in my conscience against myself so this is the nature of conscience it convicts it testifies it bears witness and so it's something that's judging and assigning praise or or guilt praise or guilt then this this statement here their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another well there you go paul is taking what the conscience bearing witness puts it in this in these terms that meanwhile their thoughts will either alternately defend them or accuse them and and there's there's different ways i realize there's a different way that this can manifest that if you have somebody who's doing right and their conscience then agrees so their thoughts are saying you've done well but when they've done something wrong then you can have this thought that says you ought not to have done that and so they have this conscience he's saying their thoughts alternately saying accusing or excusing accusing or accepting accusing or saying it's saying you've done well so the conscience can accuse or it can excuse our conscience can vindicate or condemn i know what you're thinking when you finally start saying something we you know we haven't heard or where the gift really starts working we'll start nodding a little bit more fervently with our eyes open preferably so conscience is an inward witness it being an inward witness no one can know it but god who knows all things i i can i can i can i can look at you and and try to read your mind and and and i can say oh i know what you're thinking and and a lot of people try to guess at it but you know what your conscience is even when you're very adamant about something you know when your conscience is gripping you and god knows it too so it's an inward witness now i'm going to take a a focus here on how that our conscience ought to be in hebrews chapter 10 verse 22 it's going to it's gonna show the nature of conscience and how god deals with it because when paul excuse me when john says if our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart he's speaking about our conscience and god is mindful of your conscience and so he says let us draw near with the true heart in full assurance of faith let us draw near let us come boldly before the throne of grace let us draw near unto him with the true heart in full assurance of faith that's what i desire to be made manifest life a true heart in full assurance of faith not just a heart of faith but a true heart in full assurance of faith and it says having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water it's not just not the it's not a merely a reference to water baptism where we would need to be washed with water which has been purified but it's a reference to this body of a person and the completeness of our being and so we must draw near with the true heart and full assurance of faith and then he says this having a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience salvation begins with the cleaning of our conscience this is where salvation begins if we're going to experience salvation it must begin with cleaning our conscience of guilt so we could take a step back and say salvation is begins when the word convicts our conscience of guilt and in order for us to experience salvation there has to be a cleansing of guilt if you never feel guilt then where's the repentance so this is the real heaviness salvation then begins with god dealing through it with us through our conscience and then cleansing and purifying our consciousness of guilt because the blood of jesus christ purifies the heart the blood is is designed to purify one's conscience so if we're going to have justifying faith if we believe in justification if we have justifying faith it is it insists that we know our sins are gone that's what justifying i'd say it implies it but i just want to say insist it you cannot have justifying faith if you do not believe your sins are gone so this is the very basis a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience means that you no longer have a guilty conscience an evil conscience is a condemning conscience an evil conscience is a guilty conscience we want to have our consciences first cleansed our conscience cleansed from any guilt so having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience this is what brings us into fellowship in first peter chapter 3 verse 21 the like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but water baptism now is the answer of a good conscience towards god that's what actual physical water baptism is it's an answer of a good conscience a good conscience is one that is not condemned so baptism is the answer of a clear conscience it knows that sins have been atoned for so when you know that your sins have been forgiven water baptism is an outward sign or of an answer of a conscience i know i am no longer guilty i know my sins are no longer held against me i know that they've been atoned for so a good conscience is one that is not condemned and let me say this our hearts must experience pardon in order to experience renewal if we say well i forgive you but listen god doesn't put us on probation there is no purgatory all right we are justified freely forever when we receive when our conscience is sprinkled by this blood of jesus christ when it's been washed then it's something where we experience a full pardon of forgiveness a justification so that i have a conscience that is not defiled with this sense that i'm still under condemnation i'm still under penalty in hebrews chapter 10 verse 2 for when they would not have ceased to be offered it's talking about the natural sacrifice and the bringing of continual goats and sacrifices under the law for then would they not have ceased to be offered if it had accomplished what it was supposed to ultimately accomplish then why would they continually be offering it because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins it's very important to understand what the scripture is saying here if if the sacrifice of an animal had it fully atoned in the way that the blood of jesus christ has then they would have offered it once and that would have been it but he's saying that that they would have they should have no more conscience of sins that means they'd be discharged from the guilt of sin and discharged from the penalty of sin and if discharged why another sacrifice why would you have to continually offer it you would you would not be liable to condemnation you would not be subject to punishment so what would the need be to sacrifice again and so it says in hebrews chapter nine verse nine which he said this previously so i think first chapter 10 is amplifying this more but let's look at it backwards here the worshiper once purged would have had no more conscience of sins if the what the law the sacrifices of the law accomplished what christ accomplished hebrews 9 9 which was a figure from the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices this is the sacrifices under the law that could not make him that did the service perfect pertaining to what as pertaining to the conscience the blood of a bull the blood of a goat never made the offers conscious perfect a man would go and offer the sins of a bull and he'd be like that bull has no idea what i've done this goat has no i'm being identified with it but he knew in his in his mind he knew that he was still he had still done it and that this was merely to appease god's wrath this is this is in and walking in accordance to the law which we have been commanded but the scriptures acknowledging that everyone that offered that sacrifice had to continually offer and there's things that were continually done in things that were offered for instances of sin in order to what protect the sinner from judgment but he still had a conscience that would condemn him so let's invert this is what the bible bible's trying to say in pointing out that the the offering of a sacrifice in the old testament could not bring an answer of a good conscience and could not purge them of their consciousness of sin and he says it could not make the ones that offered it perfect as pertaining to the conscious then what we can believe and what we can accept is that the blood of jesus christ can perfectly remove the sense of guilt that this is how we if that if those sacrifices and offerings were imperfect and that it did not purge this worshiper of the consciences his conscience a guilty conscience and it did not perfect his conscience then the blood of jesus christ does perfect our conscience removes the sense of guilt it frees our hearts from the feeling of condemnation that's what it ought to do so it says in verse 14. how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god if the blood of animals was some perpetuation which stayed the judgment and and conducted worship to or was a conduct of worship to help the sinner how much more ought the blood of jesus christ purify your heart from fear purge your conscience from guilt purge your your thoughts from alienation from him and it says it actually purge your conscience from dead works so it's actually purging us from self-preservation where there's a sense of condemnation there's a sense of guilt there remains the the unction then to do something for yourself fight or flight i got to do something i got to preserve myself it purges us of selfishness so the word notice what the scripture is saying the word removes the stain of sin even in our conscience bringing peace bringing pardon pacifying any any uncomfortable notions and it therefore it purifies our conscience when it says it purges your conscience from dead works dead works or those that do not spring forth from faith and love any works you say any work that is not birthed from faith or love is a dead work even if it comports with a commandment still a dead work dead works are not you know uh you know snorting cocaine oh that's a dead work you know what dead work would be being baptized without a revelation of the forgiveness of sins romans chapter five verse one this is how it can conclude this therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ justification means i'm free from the guilt of sin and sin which deserves punishment this oh i i i want to i want to just i feel that i would just be it would be worth repeating over and over again to 100 got it to some of us justification is this thought that to god i never did it in the first place and somehow we're having to constantly remind ourselves and tell ourselves that i've been justified i've been justified but a revelation of justification ought to spill over from a soul that has been set free and is sealed and cannot be touched by anything other than faith ought to spill over into our conscience and therefore be afforded a conscience that is not condemned that we are justified by faith but how am i going to live in all the attributes and qualities and characteristics of justifying faith if i allow my conscience to be condemned so being justified by faith i have peace with god and my mind is at peace i i am justification means and i claim and i will ask for and i will pray for and i will desire to be delivered from any guilt of sin because a clear conscience and a clean conscience is one that is at peace there's no sense of lingering guilt we're not living in dread that something's going to catch up to us right as we focus victory victory ahead is victory now so we're not just looking to our past thinking that somehow something's going to accumulate to overthrow us but so there's no sense of a lingering guilt it's a heart that's been liberated it's a heart that's not condemned these are some of the principles in the word of god showing us how the how god deals with our conscience do you follow this god deals with our conscience the word is doing this he has purified your souls my soul is set free my soul is delivered i'm born again by the baptism it goes to my soul what about a conscience how what kind of doubling would there be i'd like to really get into that just even the principles of schizophrenia and some of us are you know message schizophrenics in a real sense because we've received a word that transforms our souls but we allow so much nonsense to take place in our conscience that's like we're living a double there's two different people you got you believe yourself and your and your doubting self and it's like which one's going to show up today now take it a step further and i really really want to hurry because i i purpose that if i was at a certain point if i didn't get to a certain point in an hour i was gonna just have to shut her down so be careful which way you pray i don't want anybody hoping i shut down too soon wouldn't want anybody dragging this prolong in this too long so now but john if you could give this next slide conscience is different from consciousness i didn't get a wow or ooh conscience is different ponder this now think about this we have a conscience but then there's consciousness or to be conscious now i want to divide these two because this is a very important distinction to make here these are two distinctly different words but they're derived from the same latin roots the khan in sayer which is the khan which means to be together joined joined together jointly and the verb sired which means to know is what we get science from con science it's joined these things are joined together so you have conscience and that's what we've been focusing on so far but i would take a moment i want to step back and look at kant to be conscious and a con to be conscious is an adjective so our conscience is a noun conscious is an adjective which means knowing or to be aware of so if you're conscious of something you're aware of a fact if you're conscious of something you're endowed with certain mental faculties so if someone is conscious what we mean is a person is awake and alert able to understand what is happening around them when when someone is asleep or someone gets knocked out what do you say they're unconscious we know they're breathing we know that they're they have all these other vital signs but they don't have a mental awareness of what's happening and that's what consciousness is so it indicates whether a person is alert and able to understand things around them and so consciousness can relate to or imply that a person is aware of a particular fact are you aware that it's cold are you aware that it's hot are you aware that this has happened or that's happened could be a conscious that you're aware of a particular feeling like a a burning or or or a chill something those are ways that you could say someone is conscious of something and then it's also used in the sense that one's consciousness will will moderate whether an act is deliberate or intentional whether it's someone who was just the decision to do something yeah i i intended to throw the rock over the fence but i wasn't conscious that it would hit the window right brother jack i i i knew what i was doing when i threw the rock over the fence but i wasn't aware that it would hit the window unless you he actually meant to hit the window hypothetically right brother jack this is what conscious our consciousness means it's an awareness of thoughts awareness of actions or feelings sensations perceptions it's an awareness of mental processes it's awareness of our thinking so consciousness then is seen kind of as like a uh it shifts our consciousness shifts based upon processes many different things that are happening so our consciousness can i i just want to be very deliberate how i express this our consciousness changes based upon what we're sensing or what we're feeling and so it can be uh what based upon what i'm thinking based upon what i'm seeing what i'm experiencing in the world around me is what informs informs my conscious mind now conscious mind it's it's i realized as i was studying this in the message last week that brother bannon makes reference to the five outlets of the spirit imagination conscience memory reason and affection and and so these elements these gates are these channels in the spirit you can see that these elements are certainly making up consciousness the conscious mind even in science and and study is a defense fantasies or feelings or memories and perceptions your imagination your memory your reason your affection this is all in the conscious mind and so consciousness is the aspect of many different mental processes instead of it just being a single process itself i hope i'm not losing you should should we should we deviate into quantum mechanics for a moment just to get all on the same page and schrodinger's cat i think i had some people throwing down some serious types on that the other day and i was like this is going to get good when we get to it the consciousness then is an aggregation of all these different mental processes it's not just a mental process in itself so therefore you can see that our conscious is informed by imagination memory reason affection conscience because think about that let me just use an example our memories can be conscious but consciousness is not only a memory right we can be conscious of our affection but conscious is not only affection this is this is how consciousness relates to these things so consciousness gives us the ability to be aware of what's happening around us we can say that it's even related to perception in a sense but consciousness gives us the ability to be aware of the world around you and how you fit into it you ever heard of someone who's not able to read the room or know your audience that's somebody who's not conscious sometimes of how they fit into a particular situation but let's take it to another level if consciousness gives us the ability to be aware of the world around us and how we fit into it conscience and this is maybe more appropriate to the person who doesn't know how to read the room conscience is your ability to act correctly within the world that you're conscious of so do you start to notice the difference i know we're just right here right in the middle of a service kind of slowing down and making this distinction but consciousness gives us the awareness of the world around us what the circumstances are in the situation conscience tells you what the right thing would be to do in relation to those things conscience is different from the senses and thoughts that are based upon sensory perception and reflex that's our consciousness our consciousness is based upon reflex and sensory input but our conscience is different from that our conscience is the ability to discern between right and wrong our conscience is what tells us what is moral our conscience is what tells us what's appropriate so someone can be fully conscious but what is going to help them in relation to what they're conscious of the right kind of conscience and so i'm just a minute under an hour because i said if i didn't get to this in an hour i'm going to have to just stop but here we go i'm gonna try this first timothy chapter four we may just do it really quick because i wanna highlight this and move on this is where i think i'm we'll be picking up on next time first timothy chapter four verses one to two this is where you can begin to see this divide between conscience and consciousness now the spirit speaketh espressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron think about that having their conscience seared with a hot iron now it says speaking lies and hypocrisy a hypocrite's a traitor to conscience and so the more hypocritical you become the more the dissonance has got to be remedied and what happens to a really really good liar they forget their line and that's how good they get at it like he does realize that if a helicopter doesn't land in 15 minutes he's lied about the fact that his dad owns a helicopter and he's picking him up from church and he's on his way here now and should be here in 15 minutes like the gig's up at that point but a con artist someone who's lying always feels comfortable why because they've gotten to the place where they're calloused and so heartened so these hypocritical liars he's saying that there's this process unfold they shall depart from the faith given he deserving spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy these hip-hop hypocritical liars whose consciences are seared their seared conscience makes them incapable of acting correctly their conscience is seared with the hot iron so this is a conscience that's been cauterized or hardened it's past feeling so they have no regard as to what they're saying or what they're doing and the consequence of it and what paul begins to point out i want you to really focus in especially for our neighbors in the apartment next door really focus in once they've spoken these lies in hypocrisy and come to a place where their conscience is seared with the hot iron they are past feeling and have no regard for what they're doing whether it's right or wrong but under a cloak of justice under a cloak of self-righteousness they commit wrong acts they do things hateful spiteful and harmful they do unrighteousness there is a this is a i want to point out it's a consciousness that has been defiled to the point to where it's evil and it is not moved appropriately like what i'm about to do can destroy but the conscience doesn't say that wouldn't be right it excuses it it's dead that part's dead they don't have the appropriate uh feeling that what they're doing is is wrong there's a there's another sense that maybe it might fit within the spectrum as things unfold to a point where you begin to uh depart from the departure from faith results in this dissonance and this these activities and these things that are being done and they have what's called a branded conscience and this is how a lot of people interpret the scripture that it's branded in that they're acting against their conscience they're aware that their actions are wrong so they have a bad conscience and their constant is branded like a like a mark has been placed on them and they know i shouldn't be doing this is awful this is horrible but one whose conscience has been branded can put be pushed to the point where it no longer has feeling and so there's different states of conscience conscience in the bible it can be pure or good and if you study in the scriptures you'll find that it can be weak it can be defiled it can be evil and it can be seared and so as you see these the the these the spectrum of conscience that it can be pure good weak defiled evil seared and each one of these is going to have a way to where the person interacts and moves let me say this the opposite of a seared or numb conscience is a clean conscience so i'd like to go quickly through just a few points this is kind of putting some stuff there that maybe we can pick back up later and build into something that makes that is is more relevant to us but i i want to take it from this scripture some shall depart from the faith in the departing is the departure from the faith that weakens the conscience and having a conscience that's weakened it leads it to becoming defiled evil seared so departure from the faith is not a departure from belief the departure from faith is not a departure from religion to depart from the faith what's happening in first timothy chapter four verses one to two the prophecy of the very times that we're living in now where people depart from the faith and give heed to seducing spirits doctrines of devils speak lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with the hot iron what happens is they do not depart from belief or religion but their faith is no longer anchored in the word they still have a fervency they still have a passion they still have a desire they still have a conviction they still have a religious heir to them but their faith is no longer in the word how did brother bradham say it that a christian's emotions and exuberance and passions and excitements are solely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh the departure from the faith is when all those things are turned away from the word and now begin to look to the flesh so think about this a little bit society's becoming more and more self-conscious conscious we're talking about conscience versus consciousness there's a social consciousness that is taking over and it's a consciousness where we're aware of feelings in motives and desires and people are becoming especially more in sin more sensitive to injustice and what is everyone calling it to be woke right right that you're you're woke you're you're sensitive now you're now conscious of injustice you're now conscious of things that are wrong but what has happened society's becoming more and more woke but they lack the conscience to act within their alertness and so what is everyone doing they're all hypocrites amen can i get a witness [Music] that's what we we sit back and we realize well that seems hypocritical and listen don't also get real sanctimonious about the the news you feed on isn't hypocritical it's all hypocritical it's all it's it's it's without a there's no foundation it's just it's it's all cells and no anchor it lacks the conscience to behave correctly within the fallen world in all the broken systems that it's really seen well this is broken that's broken but they don't have a conscience and so what happens everyone's becoming conscious but without a conscience there's a relig religious fervor to their opinions think about it there's an ardency to political ideals to social ideals to environmental ideals to nutritional ideals there's a fir there's a religion to it come on let's be honest with ourselves and this is where we we start to feel it in our conscience and we just kind of want to turn it off don't do it let the word examine us a little bit to take a step back and realize there has been uh there's a fervency in the world today that exists for things that we we might say as a christian well i don't support this and i don't support that and i don't believe in this and i don't believe in that and you realize you have to realize it's a religious zeal behind it but why why is there now a religious zeal for these things instead of for the right things it's because christians lost their zeal for the word and now people are have no anchor and they they need an outlet they need a channel they need something to believe in they need something to just give life meaning they need they need something to give them feeling they need something to pursue and not being able to find it in the word of god not be able to find it preached over pulpits not being able to find it in the name of jesus christ they resorted to other things to feel and to live and to be animated and that's what that's the world today fully woke but no conscience because your conscience distinguishes between what's good and bad your conscience prompts you to do good stops you from doing bad our conscience commends good or it condemns bad let me say this as a uh kind of just a qualifier to the unsaved they can have a defiled conscience that prompts them to evil so this the unsaved it's there's a little bit more complexity to the unsaved but i'm trying to i'm preaching to believers who need a clean conscience without a clear conscience you can't have pure joy the difference between conscience and consciousness consciousness relates to things that we can observe i just want to lay these things out there and move on our consciousness relates to things that are observable so it relates to data my data scientists help me out today it relates to information received from our senses and so within the realm of data collection there's things that can interfere with the data collection so they're trying to improve instruments so that they can perfect the collection of data did you know when you go to check the air pressure in your tire you lose pressure so you're actually not able to observe what the pressure was at before if you're using traditional instruments so they've used they want to use instruments that better instruments to be able to remove your influence and measure things without you changing it again it has everything to do with observation so observations can be measured they can be quantified and our senses can only or can only relay the data right and we have very precise instruments in certain fields and ways to try to measure data our emotions are a means of measuring data our emotions are the sensory input you can look at the five senses of the body or even the five senses of the spirit and those senses can become close they can become dull they can become influenced but this is the point i want to i just want to highlight emphasize and come to a scripture and hopefully this kind of opens this up maybe it'll just start sealing things in and tying things together the problem many times is not with our emotions or the problem with our emotions is not in the observation but it's in our interpretation there's a difference in what we observe and how we explain what we observe we can all observe there's a gigantic hole north of flagstaff right who are you talking about that's not very nice a little bit further north called the grand canyon we can all observe the hole but then we start explaining how it got there well i think it looks just like a ufo landed here i think the navajos were the first to tap into nuclear power all right we could come up with all sorts of explanations where's the problem reside usually not in the observation the interpretation the problem arises not in what we're conscious of but how we're explaining or interpreting that so we can observe a thing we can all observe the same thing but have different explanations for it we all have different interpretations as to what it means so our consciousness then is our emotional state okay that's our observation but then it's the state of our conscience that determines our conduct we can be conscious and aware of something and this is this is observable this is quantifiable this is what my dad is telling me but we don't go by that alone we can't be moved by that our problem arises when we allow our conscience but we allow our conscience to become defiled or weak or evil and it begins to interpret and explain the data incorrectly and when we have a conscience that condemns us oh i did this well that can be observable all we need to do is watch you do i saw you do it i watched you punch him in the face and let's observe we can all just agree but then where does the problem come what comes up in everyone's explanation everyone's interpretation everyone's judgment everyone's condemnation and so it's our the state of our conscience then that's going to determine our conduct going forward so let me bring it to this ephesians chapter 4 verses 26 to 27 i'm glad that i was able to throw those things out there because i'd like to pick up on them again ephesians chapter 4 verses 26 to 27 be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil this is where um it was remarkable to me this is just personal i had been studying on giving no place to the devil as it related to being numb and victory ahead is victory now and then the lord had been dealing with me on this the whole the in the same context of these things how that the problem arises not in what we observe and what's quantifiable but our interpretation of it because we can agree to the facts but what do they mean and then it was god was then dealing with my heart on a clean conscience and i felt like well i got so many different directions i could go and then the holy spirit just takes and lines it right up so they're all they're all speaking to the same thing and so if it feels like i preached three sermons today excellent observation ephesians chapter 4 though look at this verses 26 to 27 again i want to repeat it be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil if you read in this you'll find that paul is dealing with emotions clearly just in these two verses he's addressing your emotions christians have emotions we're human so the word of god is dealing with our emotions and he's talking about being provoked to anger so if you've been provoked anger there's some sort of agitation or impulse within your spirit let's not say that it's clearly not saying that there's some sort of righteous anger that's deep within your soul that's boiling up this is you're angry it's some sort of agitation in your spirit but he says sin not do you realize what paul has done is he has allowed for anger don't get too excited man fifi might tie that bow tie on right now i might start speaking in tongues thinking i i can be angry sin not it allows for anger but it cautions to not let it cause you to miss the mark be angry but don't let that anger overwhelm you don't let it consume you don't let it overthrow you you can be angry but don't miss the mark and wonder from righteousness because of it so it allows for anger by saying there better be something else controlling it because anger left to itself or something else gets a hold of anger and you let anger linger then it can cause you to transgress and go beyond the bounds of what is morally right and what's acceptable and what's pleasing to the lord and cause you to grieve the holy spirit and then you lose your peace so it's actually making way for anger so we can say this anger itself is not a sin but anger unchecked can produce malice and bitterness and revenge and when that happens it's a failure what the conscience you can you can be conscious that i'm angry that's a conscious state i'm angry you're aware that you have this feeling that i'm angry i've been provoked i'm agitated that's that's an impulse it's a feeling that's makes up your overall consciousness how are you today i'm a little bit angry i'm also happy but i'm a little bit angry why because your consciousness is a state of many different mental processes i'm the happiest i've ever been but i'm the most stressed out i've ever been right true story and we know how that works and so you see that you can have this emotion now to where and this is when making the point pure joy is not the absence of some uncomfortable emotion you can be angry and anger itself is not sin but if our conscience fails us it becomes malice becomes bitterness turns into revenge let me prove it by scripture not that you want it but just to show it mark chapter three verse five and when he had looked round about on them with anger he's talking about jesus that's the red letter there if we had it on there well in mark chapter three i didn't put it in there the one time i'm actually gonna use the slide now it's my fault bro john i'm sorry everybody look at brother john and when he had looked round about on them with anger jesus was angry was he without sin yes sir knew no sin was without sin blameless perfect through and through was tempted in all points of manner like we were so he was angry but he did not allow his anger to lead him to sin or to transgress he was angry being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole is the other now let's just put ourselves in the story oh you guys make me sick ain't gonna heal nobody today right and leave you know why none of y'all got healed today i'm sick and tired of you i actually heard a pastor one time do this i'm sick and tired of passion a bunch of people that don't have the love of god in their heart wait a minute is this a joke but that's us right that's us we're sick and tired of pastors that don't have the love of god in their heart well what about us right and this is an example where jesus was angry it's okay to be mad it's okay to be angry it's okay to be upset it's okay to cry it's okay to have sorrow jesus experienced this great wave of different emotions but yet without sin what does the devil want to do cause us to be pricked in our conscience and have guilt of sin because we sorrow guilt of sin because we're angry guilt of sin because we go through a difficult time no that's not where the sin is but jesus was angry because of the hardness of their hearts but he didn't let his anger deprive this man of his healing did not let his anger cause him to transgress against what god wanted him to do there's a saying that i came across he that will be angry and not sin let him be angry at nothing but sin he that's going to be angry and not sin then just hate the sin not the sinner you're going to be angry if not sin then know what you're angry about that when one has hurt you or offended you and made you angry be angry for the one that causes the one that motivates the one that inspired the devil that would want to destroy have empathy have feeling and compassion for the sinner hate the sin but don't hate the sinner it says let not the son be angry and sin not so it says let not the sun go down upon your anger resist any irritation or exasperation that would become a deeper sentiment than anger be angry and sin not neither give place to now this is where this is beautiful he is acknowledging and pointing out that the devil will strive to influence your mind and irritate your spirit if you're angry be angry and sin not let not the sin go down in your anger the sun go down on your anger don't let it happen don't let the sun go down on it because don't give the devil room to work though anger is not sinful there's a danger in it becoming sin if you don't address it the correct way do not allow the devil to disturb your conscience through whispers through lies slanders and accusations but act upon your anger subject to the word of god that's a clean conscience that's a conscience looking at it with this conscience that yes i'm angry but my conscience tells me versus satan's explanation listen we give place to the devil when at the first motions of sin we're not pricked in our conscience the first evidence the first resurrecting of it when something we get angry and in our anger our faith disconnects from the word you're no longer rooted you're no longer founded you're no longer grounded and what happens is we come into a state of unanchored consciousness we're angry but where's our conscience we're upset we're hurt we're torn but where's the anchor where's the channel that's going to tether our consciousness to our soul it's going to take the conscience to do that how do something that grabs a hold of it so to be this is i think the scripture just beautifully is amplifying consciousness which is the anger but sinning not is rooted in our conscience so we ought not to give any place to the devil in our conscience the way that paul writes this he is drawn directly from psalms chapter 4 verse 4 stand in awe and sin not commune with your heart upon your bed and be still say love consider the matter deeply before you act stand in awe of the one who controls all things stand in awe of christ bring christ i love the song that was sung today it said bring christ then this is the thought that i even had here when it says stand in all bring christ to the center of your conscience if something has made you angry if someone has hurt you if a situation is desperate then stand in awe of him remember that he and his wisdom has allowed this child to come to pass and i'm going to see something a hurt or a fence happens here's my anger i want to take christ and put him in my conscience i want to put christ between me and the offense because i want to be able to look at the center i want to be a look at the offender and i want to hate the offense but i don't want to hate the offender because i don't want there to be bitterness and malice and strife and all these things to begin to grip my heart so i must stand in awe and sin not commune with your heart examine your conscience tune out emotion right tune out the consciousness because many times that's where the pain really is and look now at your conscience and then be willing to have the word wash it then be willing say lord i need to recalibrate my conscience i hurt lord and i can't change it i've been rejected and i can't change it i'm estranged and i can't change it and lord all those things are bad enough but now my conscience condemns me now my conscience haunts me and be willing to let it be washed brother braham said our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures both christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the christians conscience emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love and i i'm the one that said conscience instead of heart but notice he has the hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh either with a seared conscience or an evil one or one that's defiled headed to evil eventually seared listen this is i i know i'm stating the obvious a clean conscience or clear conscience i'd like to maybe use that more particularly a clear conscience can support a person in just about any trial when your conscience is clear i have a clear conscience what what is it that really gets us all nervous when the boss calls us into the office it's your conscience and it's your conscience that'll bother you even if you're not conscious and aware of any reason why you ought to be bothered but it's just this syndrome it's in our conscience so a clear conscience can support the heart under any trial a clear conscience can be a refuge in a difficult time so what does satan want to do he wants to disturb your conscience he wants to disturb it through manipulation he wants to do it through sending data to your consciousness satan really at the end of the day may can't or he cannot ever get to your soul and what he wants to do then is manipulate your conscience and your guilt and your peace of mind through your consciousness and for a born-again believer the lack of joy is not the disturbance of your soul but it's the disturbance of your mind always remember that the lack of joy the lack of experiencing joy the lack of experiencing rest is not the state of your soul it's your state of mind amen and that's the only place the devil can work that's why it's where the greatest battle ever fought is raging right now do you mind if i go a little bit further okay thank you thank you bro john i picked picked wisely this morning [Music] i want to make reference to a statement i have the quotation on a couple slides a few slides there's many different examples we could use and i i just felt so directed to close with this statement and then come back to the church age book there in chapter two brother is talking about he's going to he's going to meet with the girl who had been a christian girl and had served the lord and then went away to college and then became insane and and he talks and he says she had this professor who got her questioning her belief in god and it led to this this mental state of mind this uh mentally unstableness instability and this is how brother brahm describes it now him being a psychiatrist this professor he swung the girl's mind until now she has become so evil and so bad so she won't even want to hear the name of jesus spoke in her presence and even her father and mother can't see her no more and she's lost her mind and this next week will go to the institution for shock treatment what are they trying to do shock something sense into her right bring her back to the right state of mind so saying that the death this professor through psychology and through words swung her mind it's her mind now that swung to a place where her conscience was so seared and her conscience was so hard she didn't even want to hear jesus christ mentioned and notice what he says the reason for the shock treatments are it's because that she turned her thoughts from christ she turned her thoughts from christ unto what that psychiatrist was moving her mind so don't read any further stop there brother brown is saying that when a girl went to college she believed in god but a professor used words in psychology to swing her mind from christ to something else and it caused her mental illness he says it was a psychiatrist moving her mind now notice what he says next and that's what we're here for this morning is to move your mind and you're thinking from the things of the world under the things of god which is eternal did you catch what he just said a lot of times we take that we take the preaching of the word now it's in the salts and the souls and the souls and the soul you just need to get the holy ghost you just need to get the holy ghost you see the word birth you should wear birth if it's not making any difference maybe you don't have the seed of god in you you've been hearing this preaching for all these years and you ain't been born again then you're probably serpent seed the word preached has first got to meet you in your mind the purpose of preaching the gospel do you realize that's why brother branham taught us how to witness that you'd start in something what are they familiar with what are they what do they want what do they do are they do they fish talk them about fishing why you don't go up to them and just punch them right in the spiritual gut you sinner dog come to jesus and then they reject you like man that person with serpent seed if i've ever met surprising you did nothing to put him in a place to receive the word of god the world today is plagued with complexes and fears and abuses and manipulations they really if they're if they if their conscience isn't seared yet they have a conscience right now that's telling them this movement isn't right but that movement isn't right this isn't true and that isn't true and i see problems but nobody has the answers and they either got to get to a place where they completely sell out through a seared conscience and then what happens when we come along we look no different than all the antis they've come up against we're just waving another flag it may not say trump it might say seven trumpets right and we're just as vitriol and in your face and dogmatic and rude and crass you guys just need god you bunch of blasphemers well that's not the god they want but the preaching of the word is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world under the things of god which are eternal notice what he says in the next statement and that's what preaching is for is to pervert thinking to a higher and better or convert right preaching of the word is to take your thinking to something higher and better into a place where christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those things which are above and in order for then our mind to then be in a place that it can reach for the things that are above there's got to be a preaching of the word that begins to wash our conscience and sprinkle our conscience and give us this feeling and sense of guilt and then in our right minds be able to look to calvary and say i i have a sense of something real i have a sense of something divine i have a sense of my own guilt and i have a sense that he has forgiveness that he's offered to me that's what brother brown begins to describe in some of these instances that the preaching of the word first has to drive out anything that's in someone's conscience and get it to align with the word of god in order to accept it into their soul and be converted i think that's powerful so brother branham says in just a little bit later in the chapter two of the church age book after he has said our spirit is clean and it is fresh and it is full the joy of the lord he said paul said the word come in power as well as voice the word preach actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went into the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife that cut out the diseases and set the captives free does anybody need surgery this morning let's stand to our feet the word preached demonstrates itself by going into your conscience and like a surgeon's knife cutting out diseases and setting you free i want someone's conscience to be healed today that's what i'm standing here for there can be a healed conscience let the word of god the word preached has it been moving you today has it been entered into your conscience like a flaming sword and cutting out diseases and setting the captives free with our heads bowed isn't it remarkable that the word preached though it's intended for our soul god is so kind and caring that he's willing to first address our minds he's one to first cleanse our spirits to put us in the right frame of mind to accept truth and if he'll do that to save us he does it to keep us let him heal your conscience tonight today let him touch it as we saying give me clean hands give me a clean heart that if we're born again our soul is clean but if we're human it's our conscience that tries to condemn us it's our consciousness that can fight against our conscience let the word arise put christ on the battlefield today let's pray our heavenly father lord i want you to seal these things now in our hearts we give our minds completely to you lord [Music] fill us with your thoughts make them all brand new the lord may not just be a renovation of my consciousness but maybe a total renovation of my conscience lord i feel that even if my conscience awareness and my conscious mind would be feeble and weak and agitated and angry my clean conscience could keep me from sinning give us a clear conscience lord [Music] take anything that's disconcerting anything that's defiled anything that's weak lord and bolster it and strengthen it to be a sinner who's experienced a seared conscience that they'll be unsaved that have a evil conscience lord may you bring feeling back and swing their mind let them feel the waves of guilt lord and godly sorrow that leads one to repentance may they experience the sprinkling of an evil conscience to be washed and made pure lord to realize then that being purged the believer once purged the sinner once purged has no more desire for sin relates to the conscience lord not our consciousness lord i pray that you help us just take a step forward in your grace help your people today as i commit them to you this afternoon bless them strengthen them encourage them as we're dismissed go with us may your presence abide upon us in our hearts and may we ponder these things lord in their the quickness with it with which it's delivered lord and the breadth of it and how much is delivered lord i parse it father distill it down take maybe be able to take their heart so they're not overwhelmed with so much and just let their conscience be pricked know what is right and what is pleasing granted i pray today lord precious name of the lord jesus christ amen look at the look at your your your whole person differently and how god wants to speak to it you have a soul that can only be touched by faith but you have a spirit full of emotions and feelings and sentiments and that part of it is a conscience let's keep a clean conscience quick be quick to repent quick to seek the lord it'll be a difference maker it'll help you
