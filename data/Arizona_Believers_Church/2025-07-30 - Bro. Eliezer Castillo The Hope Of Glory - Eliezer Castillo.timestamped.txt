[0:00] In Colossians 1:26-27,
[0:03] it says, "Even the mystery which hath
[0:06] been hid from the a from ages and
[0:09] generations, but now is made manifest to
[0:12] his saints, to whom God would make known
[0:16] what is the riches of the glory of the
[0:19] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[0:22] Christ in you, the hope of glory." Amen.
[0:26] You may be seated.
[0:30] Now, I'm sure um if not all of us, most
[0:33] of us have listened to uh Christ is the
[0:34] mystery of God revealed. And brother
[0:36] Brandham really expands on this um
[0:39] scripture and um goes into how Christ is
[0:44] in all things. He's all in all and um
[0:48] and how throughout the whole ages, God
[0:50] was trying to express something to the
[0:53] people, but it was hidden through the
[0:55] ages. this mystery and and finally here
[0:59] it's saying that this mystery that was
[1:02] hidden to the Gentiles now is given to
[1:04] the Gentiles which is Christ in you the
[1:08] hope of glory and um I I want to hit in
[1:12] this subject of hope the hope of glory
[1:16] um it's honestly one of my um something
[1:19] that I've always thought of for years
[1:21] and years and years just this thought of
[1:23] hope and um how you know me as a
[1:28] Christian in my Christian walk how I've
[1:31] thought of hope in my life and and how
[1:33] I've always felt like sometimes when I
[1:36] wasn't feeling the greatest in my faith
[1:39] where I felt like I was trying to reach
[1:42] for something um it a thought came to me
[1:46] I was thinking well you just you just
[1:48] have hope and you just have this this
[1:52] weaker version of faith
[1:54] &gt;&gt; and and you can't grasp what you want
[1:56] because you're just wishing and you're
[1:58] hoping and you're trying to be
[2:00] optimistic and um and and it is true
[2:06] there is there is a version of of faith
[2:08] that that here in the English version we
[2:11] use hope as an optimism something that
[2:15] that we wish we want something to happen
[2:18] and a lot of times we put that in front
[2:20] of our faith and we think that's a faith
[2:23] we begin to imagine that that that is
[2:26] faith that is driving us yet it's it's
[2:29] there's doubt all over it and brother
[2:32] Brandham he he goes really deep into
[2:34] that um here in the in the message uh
[2:37] mystery explained my ministry explained
[2:40] he says and 90% of the people that comes
[2:44] to the line have hope instead of faith
[2:48] now hope is one thing and faith is
[2:51] another so he's he's making them
[2:53] distinct things, two different things.
[2:55] He's saying faith is a positive sense.
[2:59] It's not a guesswork. You don't just
[3:02] imagine it. So, so this hope that he's
[3:06] talking about, it's something that we're
[3:08] we're guessing, we're presuming, we're
[3:10] imagining it.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; He says it's just as real as any other
[3:15] sense of your body. Just the same as
[3:18] sight. Sight is real. He's talking about
[3:20] faith. How faith there is a substance
[3:23] there. there's something um uh real
[3:26] there. So, human hope, it's often
[3:28] reduced to a mere optimism, a positive
[3:32] outlook um based on your personal
[3:34] desires or expectations or or how we
[3:39] founded this hope in the first place.
[3:41] It's it's based on things around us.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; We we hope that we do something or or
[3:48] we're always hoping for something.
[3:50] Brother Brandham, I'm going to um read a
[3:53] few quotes if you don't mind just
[3:55] because brother Brandham really goes
[3:56] into this. He says in perseverant, he
[4:00] says, "Yeah, if you it it it'll happen,
[4:03] but see most people has hope and wish."
[4:06] So he's putting hope and wish together
[4:09] and so forth. It becomes weak. Oh, very
[4:13] very weak when you go to speaking in
[4:16] terms of faith. So he's saying that
[4:18] there's this hope. It's very very weak
[4:21] when you try to put it in in the aspect
[4:23] of faith. We're hoping for something but
[4:26] we really don't have the substance of
[4:28] it. In another um script another quote
[4:32] he in my redeemer liveth he says it can
[4:35] be filled. Now he's talking about this
[4:37] true experience. He says it can be
[4:40] filled um with that felt with the inner
[4:43] charge that's inside of a human body
[4:46] called the new birth. the soul has has
[4:49] been magnetized unto him and once in a
[4:52] while you'll let your mind your minds be
[4:54] concentrated on him believing on him
[4:57] after a while something a reality you
[5:00] can feel something sweep over your being
[5:03] that's the vindication of his
[5:05] resurrection
[5:06] &gt;&gt; then he says it's not a guess so
[5:10] &gt;&gt; it's not a I hope so how many times have
[5:14] we used that word I I hope so there's
[5:17] very a lot tones and context that we use
[5:20] I hope so for optimism hope where it
[5:22] says well are you going to be here or or
[5:24] are you going to get the job I hope so
[5:27] right we a lot of times we use the
[5:30] cautious and the tentative tentative
[5:32] hope where it's more subdued and and it
[5:35] shows a little doubt where it's um well
[5:38] do you think the surgery will go well
[5:41] people say well I hope so right I hope
[5:44] so what what brother says This reality
[5:48] is not a guess or I hope so.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; But a lot of times we walk in with I
[5:54] hope so. Polite acknowledgement which in
[5:58] some cases when when they say well um
[6:00] are you going to be there or or am I
[6:02] going to see you? Well, I hope so.
[6:05] Right? Sarcastic where they say, "Well,
[6:08] um do you think they're going to fix the
[6:09] issue?" I hope so. Right? So, we're
[6:12] using this I hope so. But brother Ben
[6:14] Brandham says it has no it's weak.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; It it's there's there's no substance in
[6:21] there.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; And honestly, that's how the world is
[6:26] today.
[6:28] They're in this this cycle of hope.
[6:32] We I'm sure many many people in this
[6:35] world seen that that uh tsunami. They
[6:38] were afraid. They were but they they
[6:41] maybe had a little bit of optimism.
[6:43] Right. Oh, I hope the tsunami doesn't
[6:45] hit us with the earthquake.
[6:48] All the things at war, all the rumors,
[6:50] all the things that going on, the the
[6:52] world is is afraid.
[6:55] Nations are afraid. People are scared
[6:58] and and they're they're holding on to a
[7:01] I hope so. Brother Brandham says in the
[7:03] message confirmation of commission, he
[7:05] says the whole world is scared to death.
[7:09] And the whole world, even our nation, is
[7:11] like a little boy going through a
[7:13] graveyard at night whistling to keep
[7:16] himself from being afraid. We know it
[7:19] lays at the door.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; That's optimism. That's human hope.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; That's a I hope so. When we're we're
[7:27] whistling trying to make ourselves feel
[7:29] okay, say, you know what, there's
[7:31] there's hope. I hope this is going to
[7:32] happen. Right.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; I hope this is going to be
[7:38] brother Brandham. The reason I wanted to
[7:40] go through this because then brother
[7:41] Brandham goes on and he he says in many
[7:43] many messages
[7:46] how and the scripture also says it where
[7:49] we're going to we're going to see how
[7:51] you have hope as one of the greatest
[7:54] witnesses that a Christian has today.
[7:59] So, so this and the reason why I wanted
[8:01] to talk about this weak hope because
[8:03] that is a natural hope. That is an
[8:06] optimism that people have. But there is
[8:10] a true godly hope that a Christian
[8:13] should have every single day.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; They they they're standing and they're
[8:18] waiting on a hope.
[8:21] Their their faith is on a hope. I
[8:24] believe there's I forgot how much but
[8:27] it's over I I believe 158 times hope is
[8:31] used in the Bible about 50some times in
[8:35] the New Testament. So, so a lot of times
[8:38] when I was a young person I would look
[8:40] at these scriptures and I'd be like well
[8:43] try I don't know how how to deal with
[8:45] this because my version of hope was this
[8:48] weak weakling of of of of a thing. Sure.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; So, so now your your scripture is
[8:54] chocked full of this word hope. Yet, if
[8:58] if you don't see it in the right lens,
[9:00] you're going to kind of push it to a
[9:01] side because hope is a weak version of
[9:04] faith.
[9:05] It's a weakling. It can't get you there.
[9:08] It can't get you to the promise.
[9:11] But then, brother Brandham, he says in
[9:13] in um here him, he's talking about Jesus
[9:16] and and how he has his three witnesses,
[9:19] Peter, James, and John. And he says,
[9:21] "Now as Jesus God taken up his son to
[9:24] the mount transfiguration before three
[9:27] witnesses,"
[9:29] he doesn't call them their names. He
[9:31] says love, hope, and faith.
[9:35] He says those three elements. Now, an
[9:38] element is a distinct part.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; It's its own thing. It's not a weaker
[9:44] version. It's a distinct part. So these
[9:46] three things are elements, distinct
[9:49] parts.
[9:50] He says those three elements the
[9:54] sufficient elements to work out every
[9:57] problem the church has.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; So every Christian should have these
[10:02] three things hope faith and love. Well
[10:06] how are they positioned in our lives?
[10:08] Brother Bram says those three elements
[10:11] will work out every single problem the
[10:14] church has.
[10:17] You let faith, hope, and charity get
[10:20] among the people in a church and watch
[10:23] what takes place. He says, so he
[10:26] manifested his son before these great
[10:29] these great elements, hope, faith, and
[10:31] charity. Now, I want you to notice now
[10:34] under the cloud. Now, he talks about um
[10:36] Elijah and Jesus and and Moses, how
[10:38] under the cloud there was three more
[10:40] witnesses.
[10:41] But but um brother these these are
[10:45] distinct parts.
[10:47] These are things that are needed.
[10:49] Brother Brandham says these are the
[10:50] greatest witnesses are needed in a
[10:53] church to fix any problem.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; And we know that we are a temple. We are
[10:58] a church within ourselves. So we're we
[11:00] need that need hope, faith, and love. So
[11:03] every issue that we have, we rely on
[11:06] these three things.
[11:09] In in Job 27:8,
[11:12] it says, "For what hope do the godless
[11:15] have when God cuts them off?" And now
[11:18] this is the New Living Translation. And
[11:20] just so that it'll be more um
[11:22] understandable or it was more
[11:24] understandable to me, but it says, "For
[11:26] what hope do the godless have when God
[11:28] cuts them off and takes away their
[11:31] life?"
[11:33] So, so without God when there is a
[11:36] cutting away from God, hope is lost.
[11:41] So, hope is is needed or God is needed
[11:45] for the hope to be there.
[11:48] Hope is an element. That's why in 1
[11:52] Thessalonians 4:13 and 14 it says, "But
[11:55] I will not have you ignorant, brethren,
[11:57] concerning them which are asleep, that
[11:59] ye sorrow not even as others which have
[12:02] no hope."
[12:05] So there's a hope in Christ. There's a
[12:08] hope in a believer. For if we believers
[12:11] that Jesus died um no no for for if we
[12:15] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[12:17] even so them which are asleep in Jesus
[12:20] will God bring with him. That's our hope
[12:23] in as a Christian.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Without God, without Christ, we have no
[12:29] hope. We have no expectation. That's
[12:33] what hope is. It's a sure expectation of
[12:37] something that is coming.
[12:40] And one of the greatest expectations
[12:42] that Jesus showed from his time all the
[12:45] way to re revelations all the way to the
[12:48] end of the book of revelations is I will
[12:51] come quickly.
[12:53] I will be there. These things will
[12:54] happen shortly after this. This will
[12:57] happen. So there has to be an element of
[13:00] expectation and that's where the
[13:01] Christian stands with his hope.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; And if that's taken away, you're you're
[13:08] cut away from God. And um
[13:12] and so this this hope it's a Greek word
[13:17] and and in Hebrew there's a lot of
[13:18] words. There's tikva and um uh well
[13:23] there's many more that I don't remember
[13:24] but there's a lot in Hebrew which is
[13:27] used for hope which means waiting
[13:30] expectation
[13:32] waiting on the Lord. In Greek, there's
[13:34] this word elpus and it signifies this
[13:37] positive expectation or anticipation of
[13:40] something good in the future. It's not
[13:43] just a vague wish like like a like human
[13:46] hope, but it's a confident hope based on
[13:50] faith,
[13:51] &gt;&gt; faith and trust. And now you have
[13:53] alpito, which is kind of the verb
[13:55] derived from alpis, and it's used the
[13:58] act of hoping.
[14:01] So that's what the Christian hope is.
[14:04] It's an expectation of the future.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Now
[14:10] here um brother Brandham continues on
[14:14] with these three witnesses. He says now
[14:16] just so that we can see how important
[14:18] these witnesses are. He says in
[14:20] spiritual adoption he says the three
[14:23] God's speaking to them now the three is
[14:25] a confirmation. He's taking um with him
[14:29] Peter, faith, James, hope, John,
[14:32] charity, faith, hope, and charity. These
[14:35] three, if you can have faith, hope, and
[14:37] love, you're near the kingdom. Then
[14:40] these three great things. Now, you he
[14:44] always had these people in um his great
[14:47] events. He had them in the
[14:49] transfiguration. He had them with uh
[14:51] Jarius's daughter, and he had them at
[14:53] the Garden of Gethsemane. And if you
[14:56] want to just look at it a as a
[14:58] Christian, if you look into the Bible,
[14:59] you start seeing why these three
[15:03] elements needed to be there. Why these
[15:06] three people needed to represent love,
[15:08] faith, and hope
[15:11] that these things where where Jesus, he
[15:13] was showing what love in the mount
[15:16] transfiguration, but he was showing a
[15:17] hope of a resurrection.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Where Jarius's daughter, he was showing
[15:21] the faith. Right?
[15:24] &gt;&gt; And with the Gethsemane, he was showing
[15:27] love for God so loved the world that he
[15:30] gave his only begotten son. And you can
[15:32] continue on and see so much more how God
[15:36] uses these three elements or these three
[15:38] witnesses in those great events.
[15:43] So he used him. So as a Christian,
[15:46] whenever we're going through things,
[15:47] whenever faith is needed, whenever there
[15:51] there's a healing needs to be done,
[15:53] love, faith, and hope is there. Whenever
[15:56] there's a glorification, love, faith,
[15:58] and hope is there. And whenever you're
[16:00] going through the darkest times of your
[16:03] life, love, faith, and hope has to be
[16:06] there. Those three elements in a
[16:08] Christian's life.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; So he he says, he continues on in
[16:13] spiritual adoption. And he says, "Under
[16:15] these three uh under the witness of
[16:17] hope, under the witness of faith, under
[16:19] the witness of love, God placed his son
[16:22] positionally in the public of all three
[16:26] greatest manifestations,
[16:29] hope, faith, and love that the world
[16:31] will ever know." So these are elements,
[16:36] the greatest witnesses, and he says the
[16:38] three greatest manifestations, love,
[16:41] faith, and hope. Now, in the scripture,
[16:44] if you'd like to turn with me to um 1
[16:47] Corinthians 13:3,
[16:52] here is where Paul he he starts to
[16:55] explain this. And of course, we know 13,
[16:58] he starts talking about love, talks
[17:00] about charity, how it never fails, and
[17:02] and how it's greater.
[17:04] But then then he starts talking about
[17:07] something amazing that we see in our
[17:09] time today. He says in uh 13:9, 1
[17:13] Corinthians 13:9, he says, "For we know
[17:15] in part and we prophesy in part.
[17:19] But when that which is perfect is come,
[17:22] then that which is in part shall be a
[17:24] done away with, done away. When I was a
[17:28] child, I spake as a child. I understood
[17:30] as a child. I thought as a child, but
[17:33] when I became a man, I put away childish
[17:35] things. For for now we see through a
[17:39] glass darkly, but then face to face. Now
[17:42] I know in part, but then I shall know
[17:45] even as I am um even as also I am known.
[17:49] And 13 he says and now. So he's talking
[17:53] about the perfection to come which we
[17:56] know through the word is here.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; He said a perfection was going to come.
[18:02] We know in part but one day we'll know
[18:04] in full. And we know that that as the
[18:07] time as the ages, God was hiding a
[18:10] mystery.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; And now it's revealed to us.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; But but he says as these things are
[18:19] going on
[18:21] as these things cuz if I would want a
[18:24] raise of hands, who's perfect today? We
[18:26] we nobody would raise their hand. Even
[18:30] though perfection is here,
[18:32] &gt;&gt; we're still walking into those things,
[18:36] &gt;&gt; we're still walking into a perfection,
[18:39] being fully known by God
[18:42] &gt;&gt; and fully knowing God. So, so as we are
[18:45] walking into this perfection that has
[18:47] already been provided for us,
[18:50] here it says, "And now abideth
[18:54] faith, hope, and charity."
[18:57] these three but the greatest of these
[19:00] three is charity.
[19:03] So, so hope is not a weak version of
[19:06] faith. It works with faith.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Just as faith works with love.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says an amazing
[19:15] quote here in says in the message he
[19:17] swore by himself. He says, "Watch three.
[19:21] Everything in the Bible is three. Three
[19:23] blends to a one. see the father, the
[19:27] son, um the the father, the son, holy
[19:30] spirit, not three gods, one.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; So you have these three elements or
[19:36] these three distinct parts, but it's one
[19:39] person.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Then he says faith, hope, and charity.
[19:44] Not three different things, but all the
[19:47] essence of one love.
[19:50] So they're all flowing from love.
[19:55] They're all flowing from something.
[19:58] Now, now I'm understanding what what the
[20:00] prophet was was saying, how some people
[20:02] have hope and not have faith. And how
[20:06] some people have this optimism or or
[20:08] this expectation, but yet they don't
[20:10] have faith because they have one or the
[20:13] other when you need all three.
[20:15] here um in in 1 Corinthians 13:2 how he
[20:19] was talking about love, Paul explains
[20:22] it. He says, "And though I have the gift
[20:25] of prophecy and understand all mysteries
[20:28] and all knowledge, and though I have all
[20:32] faith so that I can remove mountains and
[20:35] have not charity, I am nothing."
[20:39] So hope without faith, you're nothing.
[20:42] Faith without love, you're nothing.
[20:46] It all is incapac or incompassed with
[20:49] one love.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; If you have hope without having love or
[20:54] without having faith, then you're going
[20:56] to be there wishing and hoping and and
[20:58] not having the substance of things hoped
[21:01] for.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Same thing with faith. We always talk
[21:05] about it how, oh, we got faith to move
[21:07] mountains. We got faith to heal the
[21:09] sick. We've got faith. But we don't have
[21:11] love for one another.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have love for God.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Then it becomes what? Nothing. Void.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely nothing. So, brother
[21:25] Brandham, he says in the message
[21:27] desperations,
[21:29] he says, and the same thing that is we
[21:32] must have love before we can have faith.
[21:36] And faith when we have genuine love,
[21:39] what does it do? It pushes our faith out
[21:43] on the battlefront for God.
[21:46] So when you love the Lord, when and how
[21:48] do we love the Lord? The Bible says,
[21:51] "For he loved us first. I love him
[21:54] because he first loved me."
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; So there has to be this thing where as
[22:00] Jesus says uh um no man could come to me
[22:03] unless the father draws.
[22:06] So if you have love, it's because God
[22:08] has already called you.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; And if you have love for God, even if
[22:13] it's you you feel it's not enough, it's
[22:15] not sufficient, it's love, then faith
[22:18] begins to work. The Bible, Brother
[22:20] Brandham says that faith pushes or or
[22:23] love pushes faith out to the battlefront
[22:26] for God. See, gen God, a genuine godly
[22:30] love for God and his word and his people
[22:33] will push faith out there. Love just
[22:36] takes a hold of faith and and just come
[22:39] on, let's go. And it goes cuz that's
[22:43] what love does. John 14:23, Jesus says,
[22:46] "If a man loves me, he keeps my word."
[22:50] Now, you can't keep his word without
[22:52] having faith in what he said. So see, if
[22:56] he loves God, then he keeps his word. If
[22:59] he said, "I'm the Lord that health
[23:01] thee," he believes that love makes him
[23:03] believe it because love dominates it
[23:06] all.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; So you you now we're we're understanding
[23:12] that they can't be apart. And if love is
[23:16] apart from all of them, don't worry.
[23:19] Faith is going to come. hope is gonna
[23:21] come because love that is God. John says
[23:26] God is love.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; So
[23:30] love is the essence of your faith and
[23:33] your hope. You seek for God first. You
[23:36] seek for the love of God. You seek for
[23:39] the Holy Spirit. Then you'll see your
[23:41] faith stand.
[23:43] And then when you see these future
[23:45] events, when you see the the world
[23:47] shaking, when you see all those things
[23:49] and you're still in your human body, you
[23:51] can hope for a better future.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; You can expect for something better
[23:56] because your faith is standing there.
[23:59] In Galatians 5 uh 5-6, here we see this
[24:04] correlation between all three. He says,
[24:06] "For we through the spirit wait for the
[24:10] hope of righteousness by faith. For in
[24:13] Jesus Christ, neither circumcision
[24:15] avaleth anything nor uncircumcision, but
[24:18] faith which workketh by love."
[24:23] &gt;&gt; So, so love like brother Brandham says
[24:25] pushes faith or it energizes faith
[24:30] and it working fa So faith is working
[24:33] through love. So true faith is alive and
[24:37] active only when it's rooted in love for
[24:41] God and for others.
[24:43] So you first have that then faith what
[24:47] does it do? It sustains your hope. What
[24:50] is your hope? your eager awaiting
[24:54] because the Bible says in in uh I
[24:57] believe it's uh Proverbs 23 4:23 it says
[25:01] hope that that uh doesn't come it makes
[25:04] you sick
[25:06] that that something if hope doesn't
[25:09] manifest something is wrong.
[25:14] So you have to have faith to sustain
[25:16] your hope. He says by uh by faith we
[25:19] eagerly await for the hope of
[25:21] righteousness. It's by faith. Faith
[25:24] trusts in God's promise and hope expects
[25:28] their fulfillment.
[25:31] Now that's why you know seeing this
[25:33] scripture hope in in uh uh Hebrews 11:1
[25:37] it says now faith is the substance of
[25:39] things hoped for and the evidence of
[25:41] things not seen. Now you can see it and
[25:45] separate it as as hope not having faith
[25:50] and and it has no substance
[25:53] but then you can see it in the other way
[25:55] where it's working with each other.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Faith is the assurance of things that
[26:02] you hoped for. It's the convictions of
[26:04] the of the things that not are not seen.
[26:08] Faith is present oriented. It's trust in
[26:11] God's word and hope is a future
[26:14] confidence in God's promises.
[26:17] So faith what it does it apprehends the
[26:19] promises and hope anticipates their
[26:22] fulfillment.
[26:25] Faith is the root and and and and if you
[26:28] like to say hope is the seed or the
[26:31] flower.
[26:33] Whenever whenever um somebody is healed,
[26:36] brother Brandham says your healing is
[26:39] the earnest of your resurrection. That's
[26:42] what he said in the Easter Seal. Your
[26:44] healing, the Holy Ghost, everything that
[26:47] God does for you is the earnest of your
[26:49] resurrection.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; And how did you get your healing is by
[26:54] your faith
[26:55] &gt;&gt; because you believed in God. You
[26:57] believed in his promises. And when you
[26:59] receive that healing, whenever you were
[27:02] completely healed, when you saw those
[27:03] things go away, then you have the hope
[27:06] in a resurrection.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Saying, Lord, because you did this, I
[27:11] know I've got the earnest.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; I know I've got the rope. I've got the
[27:16] token.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; That there is going to be a greater day.
[27:19] There's going to be a resurrection.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; So faith is that substance.
[27:25] It's that earnest of what you're hoping
[27:28] for.
[27:30] Romans 5:2, it also says, "By whom we we
[27:34] also by whom also we have access by
[27:36] faith into his grace wherein we stand
[27:39] and rejoice in hope of the glory of
[27:42] God."
[27:44] If you like to turn with me in Romans um
[27:46] 4:18,
[27:49] it's I I love this scripture here. Paul
[27:52] is talking about Abraham
[27:55] and
[27:56] Abraham's situation, how he was a
[27:58] hundred years old and and here it says
[28:01] who against hope. Romans uh 4:18 it says
[28:04] whom against hope believed in hope. Now
[28:08] that that's a contradiction there
[28:10] against hope believed in hope that he
[28:12] might become the father of nations
[28:14] according to what which was spoken. So
[28:18] shall thy seed be.
[28:20] And Paul, he intentionally uses the same
[28:23] word alpus. And there I understand that
[28:26] this same word taken out of faith and
[28:31] using our own human reasonings and using
[28:34] our own optimism,
[28:36] it becomes void.
[28:39] We can lose hope real quick. And and in
[28:43] in um if you think about it in
[28:48] in Abraham's situation, he had no wiggle
[28:52] room of hope.
[28:58] Th this this hope it it arises this
[29:02] human hope it arises from an um
[29:06] observable rational expectations,
[29:09] right? our see, taste, feel, smell, and
[29:11] hear. What we know of the of what we
[29:14] know of science and all these things,
[29:17] our rational expectations. It's grounded
[29:20] in the laws of nature, human reasoning,
[29:22] and probability.
[29:24] For for Abraham, natural hope has run
[29:27] its course. Think about it. He was 100
[29:30] years old and Sarah was well past
[29:32] childbearing age. According to human um
[29:35] logic, the possibility of having a child
[29:38] was zero.
[29:40] So there was no hope. There was no hope
[29:43] for this man.
[29:46] But he says that against
[29:49] this hope, against no hope, he believed
[29:53] in hope.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; So what is this hope? It's a spiritual
[29:58] or supernatural hope that arises only.
[30:01] It can only arise through faith.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; He believed he had faith in this hope.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; So this hope comes with faith.
[30:14] It arises from the faith in God's
[30:16] promise independent and visible uh
[30:19] independent of the visible evidence that
[30:21] was there. It's rooted in the trust of
[30:24] God's character, his faithfulness, his
[30:27] word. So this hope, it'll persist and
[30:30] not only persist, but it will grow
[30:32] stronger.
[30:34] Against hope, against all reasoning,
[30:37] against everything. When somebody says
[30:39] it's too late, it's done for you. You
[30:43] believe.
[30:45] Even though everything in your mind says
[30:48] it's too late for for me to be healed,
[30:50] it's for too late for this, it's too
[30:52] late for that, it's for too late for me
[30:54] to be saved. Against all hope
[30:58] &gt;&gt; against all human reasoning, against all
[31:00] voices.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; I still believe in hope.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; I still believe in the word.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; This hope is rooted in faith. It comes
[31:13] from God's word.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So against hope, it's this
[31:16] recognition of absolute
[31:19] impossibility.
[31:22] In hope is placing trust in God's word,
[31:27] &gt;&gt; in his promises.
[31:29] That is true hope.
[31:31] Having trust in God. Well, it hasn't
[31:35] come in yet. It doesn't matter. It It's
[31:36] going to come.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to come. Why? Because I
[31:41] believe. I have faith in his word. So I
[31:44] know I have hope in the future.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; I hope have hope in the things even
[31:49] though everything looks glim even though
[31:52] everything doesn't look right. Even
[31:53] though everything's working against me,
[31:56] I have hope. Why? Because God told me
[32:00] so.
[32:01] Brother Brandham, he he explains this.
[32:04] He in wisdom versus faith. He says,
[32:06] "Against hope yet believed in hope.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Hopees is all gone. Yet he believed in
[32:13] it when hope was uh done dead to him.
[32:18] Hope was dead to every scientific
[32:21] search, every resource of wisdom. Hope
[32:24] was gone. But still he believed in it.
[32:28] What was it? Faith in it. Faith in hope.
[32:32] When hope wasn't there. H he says, I'd
[32:36] like to linger on that for a while.
[32:38] faith in hope when there was no hope
[32:41] there. Yet he still believed in hope.
[32:43] See, because he said, "He told me, so
[32:47] shall thy seeds be."
[32:49] That's amazing.
[32:51] And and that's the Christian's hope. It
[32:55] It's something has to be rooted in here
[32:58] first. And if we go back to Colossians
[33:01] 1:27, he says, "To whom God would make
[33:05] known the riches of his um glory, of his
[33:08] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[33:11] Christ in you,
[33:13] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory."
[33:15] &gt;&gt; So what's the hope of glory? He just
[33:17] didn't say which is the hope of glory.
[33:19] He says Christ in you
[33:22] &gt;&gt; is your hope of glory.
[33:25] Christ in you is your expectation.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Christ in you is your confidence in
[33:32] Christ.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; He says in Christ the mystery of God
[33:38] revealed. He says notice next. Now I I
[33:41] just want to um show what this Christ in
[33:44] you is. And he explains it here. He says
[33:47] notice next. Secondly, the manifested
[33:50] Christ in you, the hope of glory, the
[33:52] great manifested God in Christ, now
[33:55] Christ manifested in you says we'll
[33:58] hurry. Look,
[34:00] what um what um was once God's great
[34:04] secret,
[34:06] great mystery secret in his mind is now
[34:09] put in the heart of the believer.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; That is the body of Christ. What was it
[34:15] once great secret in his mind before the
[34:17] foundation of the world is now made
[34:19] manifest.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; So this this word all these promises all
[34:25] of these things that God hid gave it to
[34:28] you.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; And because you have it because you have
[34:32] Christ in you
[34:34] have a hope of glory.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So where Jesus is called our hope,
[34:40] this phrase emphasizes that Christ is
[34:43] the foundation of our certain hope for
[34:45] eternal life
[34:47] there it like like says when God cuts
[34:51] somebody out there is no hope.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Even Paul where he says not like us not
[34:56] like others that sorrow because they
[34:58] have no hope of the resurrection.
[35:01] He says, "But you,
[35:04] Christ, you're tethered to him." As the
[35:06] brother said,
[35:07] &gt;&gt; you're you're anchored.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews, it says, "Hope is an anchor
[35:11] of your soul."
[35:13] &gt;&gt; When you're anchored, when Christ is in
[35:15] you, you have hope
[35:18] &gt;&gt; of a better life.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Not only something way out in the
[35:22] future, you have hope of restoration
[35:25] now. Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; You have hope of something great now
[35:29] that God is giving and he's unfolding
[35:31] every single day.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; There is a hope. There's an expectation.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; So it's it's this certain hope, but yet
[35:43] it's amazing because it's hope is
[35:45] something of the future, but he says
[35:47] Christ in you.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; So it's this certain hope of eternal
[35:51] life, yet it's the source of our
[35:53] spiritual life now.
[35:55] Christ in you. Now
[36:00] &gt;&gt; see this hope isn't some imaginary. It's
[36:03] not a guess so. It's not a I hope so.
[36:05] It's not a a wish.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It's something here now waiting for
[36:09] something over there.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; So this phrase Christ in you, the hope
[36:15] of glory in Colossians 1:27, it means
[36:18] that that Christ is dwelling in us.
[36:23] And and in in uh Ephesians 3:17, it says
[36:26] it's dwelling in the Gentiles by faith.
[36:30] It says in Ephesians 3:17, it says that
[36:34] Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
[36:37] that ye be rooted and grounded in love.
[36:39] There you go, all three.
[36:42] And in Colossians, it says Christ in
[36:46] you. So this dwelling in you is by
[36:49] faith.
[36:51] That's so faith is the substance first.
[36:55] Faith brings Christ to you and then love
[36:58] is what establishes you. It's the
[37:01] foundation. It says it's the root.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; It's what hold it. It's the essence of
[37:08] all three of them.
[37:11] But first you have to have your faith.
[37:16] Faith in the one that loves you.
[37:19] And when you understand he loves you,
[37:21] then he'll take your faith. He'll take
[37:23] intellectual faith. He'll take the hope
[37:25] that you have and he'll wrap it around.
[37:28] And he says, "These are the greatest
[37:30] witnesses. These are the greatest
[37:33] elements in your life.
[37:35] Wherever you go, you have love for God
[37:38] and the brethren. You have faith to to
[37:41] for whatever comes in front of you
[37:43] presently and you have hope in every
[37:46] promise
[37:47] &gt;&gt; that he's given you.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; So
[37:54] this Christ in you it it's it's by
[37:56] faith. Christ in you the hope of glory.
[38:01] Now Christ in you the hope of glory.
[38:03] It's the source of your confident hope
[38:06] of a future heaven, of a future
[38:09] eternity. And that that's despite all of
[38:12] our past, despite all of our
[38:15] degradation, despite of everything, us
[38:18] being called a gentile, despite all of
[38:21] that,
[38:23] &gt;&gt; we have a confidence. Amen.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Ephesians, it says Ephesians 2:12, it
[38:28] says that that at that time ye ye were
[38:34] without Christ, being aliens
[38:37] from the commonwealth of Israel, and
[38:39] strangers of the uh from the covenant of
[38:42] the pro promise, having no hope, and
[38:45] without God in the world.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; So, we were separated from him.
[38:50] Now by faith, Christ is in us, rooted in
[38:54] love. Now we've got hope.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Against all hope, against everything
[39:00] against everything against you, we have
[39:03] hope.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; We have hope. So he says this mystery
[39:09] that was hidden before the ages. So is
[39:11] he's saying that now the the mystery now
[39:14] reveal
[39:15] revealed it elevates you to a glorious
[39:18] hope.
[39:20] Now that we have this mystery, we have a
[39:23] hope.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; It's showing that those without the
[39:27] mystery,
[39:28] maybe there's a false hope, maybe
[39:31] there's conception that they have, maybe
[39:33] there's something that they think they
[39:35] have. But when the mystery is given to
[39:37] you, it says the mystery was hidden
[39:39] throughout the ages, now is revealed to
[39:42] the Gentiles, which is Christ in you.
[39:45] That's your hope of glory.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the mystery now revealed
[39:49] elevates you to the glorious hope Christ
[39:51] in you
[39:54] and it refers also to your current
[39:56] hidden spiritual life.
[40:00] So you have your hope, you have your
[40:03] spiritual life, Christ in you.
[40:05] Colossians 3:3 it says, "For ye are dead
[40:07] and your life is hid with Christ in
[40:10] God." Galatians 2:20, it says, "I am
[40:13] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[40:16] live uh nevertheless I I live yet not I
[40:19] but Christ that liveth in me. That the
[40:22] life which I live now that I I now live
[40:26] in the flesh I live by faith in the son
[40:28] of God who bel who loved me and gave
[40:31] himself for me.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; So now I live with Christ in me. Now
[40:37] today I have that mystery.
[40:43] So this is an amazing thing.
[40:47] It means that that the mystery made
[40:51] known amongst the men uh Gentiles. It's
[40:54] precisely this. It's Christ present in
[40:57] you assuring your future glory. As
[41:00] simple as that. Christ in you now,
[41:03] &gt;&gt; working in you now, in your life now,
[41:06] &gt;&gt; assuring you for a better future.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[41:11] I I love that. I I feel more confident
[41:14] when brother Brandham talks about the
[41:16] token
[41:17] &gt;&gt; talking about the earnest how how by
[41:20] faith we have this token. We have this
[41:23] Christ in us
[41:26] and that token is showing is it's giving
[41:29] a signal to everyone around us saying I
[41:33] have the hope.
[41:35] This ship is falling but I have the life
[41:37] vest.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's a hope,
[41:42] brother Brandham. He he says in Christ
[41:43] is the mystery of God revealed. He says,
[41:45] "Now listen close. I don't want you to
[41:48] fail fail this." Now, he's going to
[41:50] explain that it's only this that God
[41:54] looks for. He says, "I I don't want you
[41:57] to fail to get this. No other church, no
[42:00] other sign, no other fellowship, no
[42:03] other government, no other testimony, no
[42:05] other creed, no other denomination is
[42:08] acceptable outside of this. God accepts
[42:11] nothing else but Christ in you, the hope
[42:14] of glory.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; The only thing God recognizes, no
[42:18] fellowship, no church, no creed,
[42:22] no denomination, no nothing. Everything
[42:24] else is dead. It's fragments that has to
[42:26] be cut off, pruned away from the thing
[42:29] that Christ might live with preeminence
[42:32] in you.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; I I started to think about that. Um I'm
[42:36] not going to hold you too long, but I
[42:38] started to think about that how Christ
[42:41] in us that is our hope
[42:44] by faith rooted in love. And now we have
[42:48] hope that that that is the the flower.
[42:51] That's the last thing of this hope. I
[42:54] mean this faith or this love, faith and
[42:56] hope.
[42:58] We have hope because we have love
[43:01] because we have faith.
[43:03] And started to think about Rahab, how
[43:07] God gave Abraham a promise.
[43:10] God told Abraham, "I'm gonna give you a
[43:12] land, and this land, it's going to be
[43:15] yours. But before I give you this land,
[43:18] your people are going to have to be
[43:19] souljourners
[43:20] &gt;&gt; in another land for four generations."
[43:24] He says, he says, "And after that, he
[43:28] says, for the iniquity of the Amorites,
[43:31] when they it it's full, that's when I'm
[43:34] going to give you the land." But he
[43:36] says, "The iniquity of the Amorites is
[43:38] not yet full." This is in Genesis 15:16.
[43:42] So, so he's giving them a promise, but
[43:45] he's saying the sin has to be so bad in
[43:48] that land that the very land is going to
[43:51] spew them out.
[43:53] And in Leviticus, I'm not going to read
[43:55] it, in Leviticus 18:24, it shows how how
[43:59] before they're going to walk into the
[44:01] land, he begins to tell them that don't
[44:03] defile yourself like these people. that
[44:06] these people are are are defiled people
[44:08] and the land is going to spew them out
[44:10] and you I don't want you to do anything
[44:12] with them. That means don't don't spare
[44:16] one all man, woman and child. I want
[44:19] them gone.
[44:20] Why? Because the the iniquity of the
[44:23] Amorites is full.
[44:26] So that's that's what they do. Of course
[44:28] they they failed the first time in
[44:30] Kadesh Barnea. They failed. But now
[44:32] you've got Joshua and he sends two two
[44:35] spies
[44:37] and he they go into Jericho and
[44:40] they find this woman that the most
[44:43] unlikely woman.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; She she had no glory in herself.
[44:50] She's if you want to I could see myself
[44:53] in her because we are Gentiles, aliens
[44:56] from God,
[44:57] &gt;&gt; unworthy, having no hope. And now you
[45:01] see this woman. She she's walking
[45:03] around. Not only that, but Jericho is in
[45:06] the same condition that maybe United
[45:08] States is in today, having no hope.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; The iniquity of the Amorites. They're
[45:14] full and and they heard of the judgments
[45:17] coming
[45:19] and they're scared.
[45:21] There's no hope.
[45:23] But then she sees these men and by
[45:26] faith, the Bible says, Hebrews 11:31, it
[45:30] says, "By faith the harlot Rahab
[45:32] perished not with them that believe
[45:34] not."
[45:36] When she had received the uh the spies
[45:39] with peace. I don't know how it
[45:41] happened, but she saw them and maybe
[45:44] she, you know, how they they kind of a
[45:46] Airbnb, but she was worse than that. But
[45:50] she she had her home out there and she
[45:53] said, "Stay at my place."
[45:56] She received him with peace
[46:00] by faith. It says,
[46:02] &gt;&gt; "So first her faith had to be
[46:05] activated."
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; First she had to believe.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe she had to believe in these
[46:11] promises. Maybe they were saying
[46:12] something and and she was just says,
[46:14] "You know what? These people are
[46:15] different. You know what? What what do I
[46:18] have? What hope do I have in this world?
[46:22] We know that the Israelites are coming.
[46:24] We know judgment is coming. We have no
[46:26] hope.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; So by faith she went. James, it says,
[46:31] "Likewise, James uh 2:25, likewise also
[46:35] Ray Rahab also was not Rahab um the
[46:39] harlot justified by works when she
[46:41] received the messengers and had sent
[46:43] them out another way." So by faith
[46:48] she received him. She began to work and
[46:52] she brought him in.
[46:54] She began to tell them, "We we know we
[46:58] know your God. We believe.
[47:01] We know how great he is. We know what he
[47:04] did at the Red Sea. We know what all all
[47:06] these things happened. We we know who
[47:09] you are."
[47:12] and and and
[47:14] because of that her her her desperation,
[47:17] she began to say, "Show kindness to to
[47:19] me and my family." Even there was a
[47:22] point where the king came down and he
[47:25] realized that she was harboring these
[47:26] people and and she was sent forward and
[47:29] and she had to lie for them. And when
[47:32] she went back, she says, "You know what?
[47:34] I'm risking my life, but but you are my
[47:36] only hope.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; You are my only hope of salvation. do
[47:42] something for me that that you can save
[47:44] me and my family.
[47:46] They said, "You know what? Our life is
[47:48] in your hands."
[47:50] And as as um she she lied to those
[47:53] people and they went out, she sent the
[47:56] spies away and she told them what to do
[47:58] and she sent them out out of her window
[48:01] with a scarlet robe rope.
[48:04] And as they went down,
[48:07] they said, "You know what? Leave this
[48:09] rope down here. Leave it hanging.
[48:13] And if we see that rope, we know not to
[48:18] mess with this house. We know to save
[48:22] every single person that is in this
[48:24] house, we're going to save these people.
[48:27] So, anybody that you have, friends,
[48:30] family, anybody that you have, bring
[48:32] them in.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; At first, she was the outcast. I'm sure
[48:36] she was the one that was no good. She
[48:38] was the sinner, but now she has her
[48:41] faith and now she has a string coming
[48:44] out and and she has the the the place of
[48:48] hope.
[48:50] That word, the reason why I'm saying
[48:53] this is because it was very uh
[48:54] interesting to me because that Hebrew
[48:57] word for line or rope is the word tikva.
[49:01] And and it's very strange because it
[49:03] could either be used as cord, rope, or
[49:06] hope.
[49:07] And so so she what she did was by faith
[49:12] she threw down that rope. And what was
[49:15] she doing? She was displaying the token.
[49:18] She was displaying. She had faith in
[49:22] what those people were saying. And now
[49:24] she's displaying the hope. She's showing
[49:27] I have hope that when they come nothing
[49:29] is going to happen because that is
[49:31] there.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; It's like us Christ in me.
[49:36] You take Christ in. Doesn't matter what
[49:38] we've done. No matter what the past is,
[49:40] no matter if we were alienated from God,
[49:43] you take Christ in. You take his
[49:45] promises in.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Now, that is your scarlet rope.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; That is your token.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And that token is your hope of glory.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And that's that's what she did. As they
[49:59] came, she brought everybody in and she
[50:01] was saved. And the amazing thing is she
[50:04] becomes the great great grandmother of
[50:07] David.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Even though maybe she she thought she
[50:11] was nobody, because she believed and she
[50:15] acted on her hope, acted on her faith,
[50:18] she was saved.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 15:13 in closing it says if
[50:24] you guys would like to stand and and the
[50:25] musicians come up
[50:28] says now the God of of hope I I like
[50:32] that.
[50:34] See I I can't I can't scrub that off of
[50:36] the the Bible. I can't say oh that's
[50:39] that's a weak version of faith. He is
[50:41] the God of hope.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; He he produces it.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; It is him. He is the God of all good
[50:50] expectations.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Everything good, everything that is the
[50:56] word, it has to come to pass. And that's
[50:58] why he is the God of hope.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; The God of hope fill you with all joy
[51:04] and peace in believing that ye may
[51:07] abound in hope
[51:10] through what? Through the power of the
[51:13] Holy Ghost. How do we have hope? It's
[51:16] through the power of the Holy Ghost.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Why do we have hope? Because Christ in
[51:21] you, the hope of glory,
[51:24] brother Barham, he says we have a token
[51:27] today.
[51:29] And also, we're safe as long as we stay
[51:32] under that scarlet cord, the blood of
[51:35] Jesus Christ. As an individual, not a
[51:38] group, an individual, we each must stay
[51:42] under the scarlet cord of the blood of
[51:45] Jesus Christ.
[51:47] That is our hope. We stay under him. I
[51:51] don't care what comes. I don't care what
[51:54] we have to go through, what this body
[51:56] has to suffer, what this mind has to go
[51:59] through.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; I'm in Christ.
[52:03] My life is in Christ. And because of
[52:06] that, I can hope for a better day.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; I know that something greater is going
[52:11] to happen.
[52:13] Let us bow our heads
[52:15] brother.
[52:17] Heavenly Father,
[52:20] Lord, I just ask, Father, that
[52:23] even now, Father, that you may relay
[52:25] your your word and in our hearts
[52:30] to realize that that you've set the
[52:33] greatest things in our lives
[52:36] that yet we're not perfect. Yet maybe
[52:38] some some are. No, in part, but now
[52:41] abideth.
[52:43] Now abideth. Now for the journey
[52:47] we have hope, faith and love.
[52:50] Those things one day they they're going
[52:53] to pass away because hope is only for
[52:56] something that we're waiting for.
[52:59] Faith is something that is an evidence
[53:01] of not seen. But one day we will see. We
[53:04] will be there. We will know as we are
[53:06] known. And it'll all be engulfed in your
[53:09] love
[53:11] &gt;&gt; because your love is from eternity to
[53:14] eternity, Lord. One day we'll be there.
[53:16] But as we walk in this life, Father, we
[53:19] ask, Father, that you strengthen our
[53:22] faith,
[53:23] &gt;&gt; strengthen our love, strengthen our
[53:26] hope,
[53:27] &gt;&gt; make our hope more clear as a vision,
[53:30] Father, as as eyesight, seeing the far
[53:34] future, Lord, knowing, Father, that it
[53:36] is coming and it is here.
[53:39] We thank you, Jesus. The name of the
[53:42] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and
[53:44] amen. God bless
