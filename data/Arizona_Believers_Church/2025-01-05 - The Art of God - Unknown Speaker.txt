TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Genesis 1 verse 1 and the uh title slide should give some uh might begin to tip off a little bit or give foreshadow some of the things that it's in my heart to address and to look at this is the uh creation of Adam very popular uh piece of art in the cine Chapel by Michelangelo and uh you do have to do some creative cropping Genesis chap 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth amen you may be seated I'm going to give a title uh to today's sermon the art of God and it might be a little difficult to see uh and but the title is the art of God and and seeing the title slide and then now see in in the text slide you can already begin to see maybe what my emphasis is and fellowshipping on this with different ones over the past while and mentioning that I would the Lord was dealing with my heart on Art and artwork and I find that I'm a great have great admiration for art an artist and art work and myself not being one and kind of being a poser myself and wishing uh that I could be I I appreciate those who are and who are gifted and have those talents that God has given them and as I was fellowshipping on this subject and kind of sharing my heart on what my overall Vision was somebody asked well uh where is that in the Bible and not maybe in a cynical sense but like where are you going to go scripturally and I just said in the beginning God created and so we'll come to that here in the beginning uh just to begin to amplify that but I believe as I've been uh as I'm wanting to look at the subject of art that there is a that Supreme art is the setting forth of true things that are true and that there is a uh with the art that I'm thinking about something that sets forth a statement of not just fact but a reality and I was impressed with as I've just being a lover of Art and studying art over the last few years I've been impressed with how art was used in spreading truth in particular the gospel but also spreading falsehood and how that there is a there was a certain dependency in certain periods of people on art to be able to experience a reality or to know that a reality was so we live in a day and age where we can live stream it and we can see things and believe that because it's on video or because it was on the news it happened we're also now entered into a day and age where anything can be faked H to the to the extent that you could see something on video with your own eyes it it's it's a fabrication of something that never happened so we've transitioned out of relying solely maybe on a a graphic rendering by an artist to say this is what Mount Everest looks like to being able to see it for ourselves in video to now not being sure whether or not that is what it purports to be and so it's a really fascinating time that we're living in now and this dependency of in the past ages of people to on art to experience and to know and to understand things uh and to even know that certain realities exist it really fascinated me so as I'm kind of just sharing my heart on the outset of what was how God was dealing with my heart I began to think about how that there is something we I would like to use the theme of art if I could say it that way and the Art of God and the concept of Art and artwork and creativity and how that we there is an expression of Truth in reality so it's that premise that an artist is trying to render something whether it be false reality or true reality or Express something and how that God the art of God is about God expressing truth and so I could just put it that way and then always remember the premise is the full manifestation of the word of God has got to be expressed in this hour for a Rapture so it's not just without a basis or a vision I'd like to begin by reading from the Masterpiece if anybody would like a listening list just feel free to reach out to myself or my wife I'd be happy to provide those things to you but in the Masterpiece brother brandham says one of the main things that interest me in Forest Lawn was Michelangelo's the great sculpture the Monument of Moses found a photograph uh from 1929 when they I think it was at the very inauguration of the beginning of this display I think it's still there now uh but just set up a little bit differently it says brother says it's a reproduction there of course it isn't the original but with such a great Masterpiece so here's a reproduction of an original and brother BR saying it's not the reproduction that's a masterpiece but the repr production uh is a representation of the original that was a great Masterpiece brother Bram having the opportunity says and as I stood and looked at it I like that something that looks like it or represents got something to it and he's this uh there's many statements to this effect goes I like art real well I believe God is in art and if your name is Art you can really just drill down on this and just believe with all your heart he says I like art real well I believe God is in art let me just say this if you want to find all the places in the Bible and the message of the hour where art is mentioned you're in for a long day because thou art a God and there's so many different Arts but I've read every single instance in the message and in the Bible of the use of Art and uh and I'm better off having done it brother says I like art real well I believe God is in art I believe God is in music I believe God is in nature God is everywhere he says and anything that's contrary to the original is a perversion so there is this concept of the art of God and that God is in art and that God is also in music and he's in nature and there's certain things in nature and in music and even in one place he refers to dancing in this context and things that we would say are the Arts that are original that are pure that were designed by God or inspired by God but then there are things that are knockoffs or replications or some sort of cheap reproduction that is a pervert version of the original or contrary to the original so it could be something that uh is not the original but is some sort of simulation of it but then the worst thing is something that is slightly different in a perversion of it and it's this statement that I believe God is in art and brother bam says in different ways that God is in art he's he's in it not all of it but he is in this and in Genesis 1:1 I want to begin to look at God as the original artist the original creative it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth I've used a a painting of a Russian Ivan avazi who painted this scene that he calls the creation God in the beginning creating he has another one that's about the chaos in verse two it's really really beautiful pictures but it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth this means he shaped it he formed it he fashioned it and it would be as we might say a Potter or a builder Creator one that's using material and creating fabricating and representing something shaping it forming it using these artistic and creative abilities but one things that's remarkable God is he didn't use any existing substance he was using he was the creator himself in Hebrews 11:3 it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear God created by his word and in creating by his word he brought forth everything that was in the original creation and he was not using some other man's material or some other existing civilization's material he was using creative of things he created himself brother Brandon when he's referring to the seven Church ages and how God built a church through seven Church ages he said when God started off like an artist drawing a picture of something he begins to feel in his parts and you can be you can begin to see it shape up and that's what artists will do I don't claim to be one but I've watched some do their work and they'll start with the sketch and they begin to fill in and if you ever watch a video on how to learn to draw they make it look so easy like oh I just need to do a little half circle there just do a little line here and just do a little thing there and just start to fill everything in and then you look and like what is this I'm the next Picasso or dolly or something CU looks nothing like the original but yet there's that's what God was doing in the building of a church he was like an artist drawing a picture and there's different things that begin to uh form and then he begins to fill it all in and that's how an artist will work as they know just with the right order and the right way to place things together so in the beginning when God began to create he was doing the same thing he was drawing a picture putting Parts in their place and then filling things in that they begin to shape up in Genesis 1: 14 to 15 says and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night let there be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so so I'm using this picture of Van Go Star night this is it represents the stars and the planets and the the things a very impressionist replication of the the night sky in other words this is not how it looked but it was the how it impressed him he drew it kind of in the way that he observed it and things he saw in it but he's depicting the the night sky with its stars and its planets these are the lights that God begin to bring forth when he said let there be lights in the heavens and let it the lights of the heaven give light upon the Earth and we know that God is writing his first Bible so as he begins to place these planets and these stars and their alignments in different places he's using the sky as a canvas to write a Bible it's as a work of art by an artist in Psalms 33:6 it says by the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth God as an artist one a writer is writing a story in the skies there he's putting something up there as we might say in the Zodiac and different constellations and man is not just looking at him saying hm I see this shape but it's God by Design was putting things there in Psalms 19: 1-6 and brother bram's the one that makes reference to the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin and ending with the lion and different things how there's not that we would sell out to a religion of astronomy in astrology but that there's certain types and things that exist within that he says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork God being the one that created it the artist that unfurled the canvas and then begin to place the stars and the lights within the heavens he was doing it and it declares his glory and it shows his artistry his artwork and then about this artwork notice just what it represents and what this writing of the Bible signifies there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard words it's it's a declaration throughout all the world their ly is gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world you see how the Bible was written first in the stars in them hath he set a tabernacle for the son which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there's nothing hid from the heat thereof what do the heavens declare they tell his story not history but it declares his story it's setting forth certain uh it portrays his vision there's foreshadowing there's symbolism in it it's reflecting back his plan to have a a bridegroom and a bride it shows his purposes of death burial and Resurrection it's all represented there and it tells a story in the heavens and these creations from in the beginning God created to God saying let there be and God bringing forth the land and God writing his Bible in the skies these are the art of God it's part of a whole Masterpiece of God's creation and then in verse 27 Genesis 1: 27 it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now this is the bringing forth in the creation of Adam and when God creates Adam as you see very in particular here in this scripture he says God is now he's created heaven and earth and he's created land and animals and sky and firmaments and all these things and things in the sea and things on land and there's this great beautiful uh creation that the Creator is expressing himself in in terms of his vision his desires he writes the Bible in the sky but now notice what this artist has done is he's now made man in his own image and God is God is bringing forth a self-portrait I want you to think of it that way God is bringing forth a self-portrait God's an artist who's been creating this beautiful Artistry but now he paints himself in mankind and this picture is a perfect picture I don't know if I'm able to control this maybe we've lost it ah we're on we're good and in creating a self-portrait this is one of the first self-portraits that show really how it's done and this Johan's Gump I think is his name shows that as an artist he would look in a mirror and he would paint himself on the canvas his face that he would see in a mirror so so before there were mirrors self-portraits are really hard to find and so this is this is one that shows I want you to think about this in terms of God that if he's creating a work and he and he creates him he's going to bring forth Man In His Image and his likeness there's a mirror that's reflecting his likeness and then on the canvas he's bringing forth a a something to be seen that looks like the artist when the Bible says God created man in His image and in his likeness we could say that God in some way is replicating his likeness as an artist bringing forth a self-portrait of himself self-portraits is intended to represent the artist and could either be uh uh solely them in the picture even sometimes an artist would render them as part of a group there's many different famous self-portraits this is the earliest known uh self-portrait uh van EK and this is the earliest one that they know of and most likely he probably used a mirror to do so and represents himself in a very Regal Way with the turban and they suspect even though his art was very valuable at the time and he was highly sought after that this was something that he would use to show his handiwork and show what a good artist he was and hopefully fetch a higher price and be commissioned to do other things this is one of the more interesting ones Corb of a uh of the desperate man I'm not going to try to say it in French and it has a real interesting connection with art the desperation of man Da Vinci who did his own self-portrait unique line and very singularly but it's it's him that's in it famous ones of rembrand and self-portraits of different time periods there's a lot of famous ones I was going to use the ones of the guy who was always doing funny faces and uh we might use those for later but self-portraits are things that really stand out to us and it reflects the artist and it's one of the things that I guess at one time when I would look at Art it be yeah that's that's that looks good or that looks like what it should look like but you may not have an appreciation for it but it was until I began to learn more about the artist and their artwork what it represented what the context was what the story of the artist was you can begin to appreciate more what you're looking at say wow that's that's a picture of a nice Garden scene you say well it's not just a garden Scene It was painted by so and so and this is their history and this is their background and then you begin to understand the artist vision and their their story and their style and the way that they worked and you can begin to see things in the picture that you didn't see before and then you say well this picture is representing a a scene in the Bible and then you begin to notice that there's all sorts of symbolisms and scriptures that could be set forth in just one SC and it was Art it was used in a time period to be able to preach the gospel in a single panel that not one's not being able to read the word maybe not being in everyone's language that a rendering a painting artwork would be able to portray something about Christ or the glory of God and these self-portraits would Express the artist and that's what God had done when he said he created man in his own image he was it was a self-portrait of himself and then one of the most uh famous self-portraits vano in his lifetime painted more than 40 self-portrait portraits most of them not realistic did one where he looked Japanese and he looked like a Buddhist monk and he was always creative and doing certain things and setting himself forth in different looks but this is one that I would say is brutally honest when you look at those other self-portraits and then you see uh maybe photographs of the one who did the self-portrait you're thinking wow that's a very flattering self-portrait and and there's a way that if we could all really draw we would draw ourselves in a way that's very flattering and aha we can all do it now by virtue of filters right and what what we end up doing is we put ourselves forth in what we think to be a very flattering light hides our imperfections it can thin our face it can whiten our teeth it can give us hair Glory there's all sorts of things that we could do but yet it's not an honest self-portrait we'll say things about ourselves and present ourselves in a certain way and we could take something that's very imperfect and make it look very perfect but in reality that's not you but here van go did something that was honest this was in January 1889 it's the year that he painted The Starry Night it was the year before he died of a gunshot wound to his stomach and he had cut off his ear shortly before this had been institutionalized and when he paints his self-portrait he doesn't paint him in a manner to where you would not see the ear but he paints it where you do see it he paints it to where you could see this honesty of his Brokenness his shame something that was of a great stain on him and this is a portrait of man as he sees himself being honest but when God brought forth Adam that was a perfect picture there was no bandage to the ear there was no filter there was no touching up there was no God wasn't trying to make himself look better in Adam and that Adam was a filtered version of God or he was a touched up version of God a photosho version of God and and nor was he uh some of these other self-portraits with their flaws and their inconsistencies and it's certainly not this van go self-portrait after he's been institutionalized having cut off his ear and meld it to an ex-girlfriend after a fight with one his roommate this is this is the uh van go is being honest about the way that he is in his Brokenness but God's original portrait was a perfect picture and the sermon marriage and divorce brother Bam's talking about the creation of man he says I seen a picture one time and I believe it was in Greece of an artist that painted a picture of Eve she was the most horrible looking thing I ever seen that shows what a carnal mind can look at and this is one that I found that is a depiction of Eve uh and Adam with kind of a very swarmy look you know kind of you know looking over at his wife but that is not a very flattering picture of Eve this would be a horrible looking thing and he says that's the carnal mind taking their their inspiration of what they think Eve would look like and putting it on canvas with pain and with a great gift and he says but she wasn't she wasn't a horrible looking thing she was beautiful because she was a perfect woman all woman she was a perfect woman all woman and then brother Brenham says in spiritual food and due season brother John I think you can just take it from here similar statement he said that just puts me in mind of a Greek artist I seen one time in an ancient Cathedral this is the one that I think he might have been referring to I'm not absolutely certain but this is one that's in a cathedral in Italy and it is this fresco painting of Adam and Eve it says showing what Adam and Eve looked like they looked like Beast or something and if anybody knows where it is I couldn't find the one in Greece or one in a cathedral still looking uh I'm actually in the process of collecting every single an image of every single piece of art that brother brandham references not physically just the digital uh could be get that could get really expensive how did you end up with Michelangelo in your backyard thank you Bitcoin he said they look like Beast or something and you could go back and look at that picture again and you see this there is a and in the larger picture it it it doesn't look completely human he says it it's horrible looking they look like Beast or something and he says that's what the carnal mind can perceive of some spiritual thing so what did what did Adam and the woman look like and and they come up with some sort of conception of what they think they look like and then they put it on canvas they put it on Stone they represent it in a cathedral he says that's the carnal mind if you're drawing Adam and Eve and you're making them look like horrible people and ugly creatures he said that's the carnal mind's perception I think Adam was the most handsome man that ever lived and Eve was a perfect woman in every way he says now carnal Minds wraps up the thing in their own ideas now this is where I'm hoping that this begins to have a little bit more spiritual emphasis to you the carnal mind wraps up the thing and the one that transcribes this capitalizes the thing so that there's things about God things that relate to God the capital t h i n g is speaking of God his creation things that are the Divine there's a carnal mind that will wrap up the word in their own ideas so there's a there's a grasping of the word there's a grasping of God's vision and his plan and his creation and his desire then the carnal mind gets that uh uh wrapped up and then they want to bring a production of it they want to display it and they portray it and it's a horrible looking thing it's nothing like the original it's not the way that God envisioned and it's mind it's not the way the the artist had conceived it and brought it forth he says then God sends down and infolds the thing by his power so there is a conception of God in his word and his desire that the carnal mind can pervert but it's God who ultimately brings it forth and unfolds it as a canvas being unfolded as an artwork being put on display and he unfolds it by his power am the man and the woman were perfect statues of the art of God they were in the stature of God's perfect creation brother bam uses a language to express that it was this great family portrait that expressed God's original and unblemished artwork the original Masterpiece of a family God created God beginning as an artist to draw his lines and then fill it out and ultimately God bringing forth the self-portrait of man as God on Earth the expression of man and woman this is his great artwork perfect statues sculptures beautiful not horrific in the Mind's Eye of these psychologist brother B says are these artist but it was God's art in 2 Timothy CH 3: 16 And1 17 says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and I appreciate you being patient with me as I just fumble through this today and maybe there's a little bit of pressure realizing that when you you Broach a subject that seems to be combining things that would relate to maybe art and and museums and education and intellect uh but I've studied it from the standpoint of the scripture and the message of the hour and it's those things that brought the brought this subject to the Forefront for me to share this with you that there is something that God's wanting to express in this hour in this time and you've got to catch the mind of the artist or it won't be a reflection that other people see it it won't it won't accurately depict the reality of what God's wanting to express in this hour God is an artist here in 2 Timothy 3: 16 and 17 having unfurled the canvas of the sky and placed the stars and the planets to tell a story and to write his first Bible now the written work all scriptures given by inspiration of God it's representative of his Creative Vision it's something that's the very Breath of God and when we say God breathe another thing that struck me is that a man breathes or exhales when he labors it's that laboring of God this Breath of God is one who would exert his effort and his influence over this masterpiece all scripture this Bible this holy writ that we cherish so much was given by the labor in the Breath of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reprove for correction for for instruction and righteousness no written Masterpiece is as profitable as the scripture amen many men have pinned great tales and novels and stories and true accounts and there's great wisdom that can be gleaned from the volumes of books that have been written by these talented artist and authors but here all scripture given by the inspiration of God is profitable for Doctrine Repro correction instruction and righteousness and the final product that the man of God may be perfect thly furnished unto all good works the Bible is the art of God it's God's original work something that God created and then what's remarkable as the very tool the very work product of the artist can then begin to influence the viewer the one that would read the word of God would begin to profit from its Doctrine its reproof its correction instruction and this word which was inspired by God is not a mere painting that one would look like oh that's awesome that's amazing but there's something Supernatural about this written word that when you can catch the mind of the artist when you could catch the vision and see it for yourself even as a mirror it'll cause you to be perfected and thly furnished under all good works you yourself then becoming a product of the artist God in the scripture we can see as he creates it's the Creator expressing himself back out through the creat ation as an artist and as you would look at different time periods of certain artists you see their influence and this was a time period when this artist was greatly influenced by this other artist and this is a time period where they were influenced by these things and there was a lot of lot of ways that you begin to interpret the context in the time period but going back to the original there's no other influence there's no other pattern there's no other symbols there's no other ideology there's nothing else that it could be a mimic of it's God himself Elohim the great artist who bringing forth creation and he is reflected in his creation amen we find it in the earth we find it in the heavens we find it in the Bible we find it in man and brother brandham says in the sermon sir we would see Jesus he said Jesus never said he's going to bring them to Bethlehem Jesus never said to the Greeks when they come up now just a moment if you want to see it I'll take you back to Bethlehem where I was born I'll tell you how it happened back there it wasn't that it's not in the Art of Storytelling it's not in the art of travel it wasn't in the art of beholding a beautiful scene and being able to describe it and show that to him he said he point that it wasn't that he pointed them to a future place if they wanted to know him if you want to know me in other words I won't take you back and tell you when I was born at Bethlehem and all about that I'll point you to a place where I'm going to be crucified for you and in there if you'll be crucified with me and take up your cross and follow me you'll know who I am otherwise from that you'll never learn it through your ancient Arts now there was there was even an ancient art to the philosophers the Greeks and the different uh cultures and there's certainly an ancient art to what the Jews espoused but here as he talked to them the Greeks the philosophers he says you won't find me you won't find your salvation you're not going to find God through ancient Arts but you'll find me you'll find me there at Calvary and then brother brandham just notice how astute this is he says well you say brother brandham but we learn it through the art of the Bible brother B says no we don't now he's not disputing that the Bible is Art but he's disputing the fact that you could solely know God through studying the art of the Bible he says if we learn it through the art of the Bible then why didn't the Pharisees have it good point if you could if you could learn it solely just by pouring over the pages and and just studying it and looking at it from an artistic standpoint or trying to look at it within its historical accuracy and whatever the other things might be in the original language and and try to absorb it as one Masterpiece just pouring through it and learning it as a product of art itself he says you're not going to learn it through the Bible alone because if that was so the Pharisees would have immediately recognized Jesus Christ it isn't learned through the art of the Bible because we got many artists trying to paint it there's a there's a Bible we can say this is the original work of art but he said there's many other artist repainting this to what we have is not necessarily the original Bible the original work the original artwork that in itself unveil unveils Christ and in every verse there's Jesus Christ he says it's not just learned through the art of the Bible again he's not saying the Bible is not art but he's saying there's too many artist trying to repaint it or paint it he says but the Bible is right God is the artist if we study the Bible as a work of art and we're merely what looking what another man painted will completely miss it but he says the Bible is right and God is the artist all scriptures given by inspiration of God it's profitable but we can't just find it by studying it solely as a piece of art itself but we to recognize God is the artist God had a vision God had a purpose God had a desire and without that context the artwork is rendered less meaningful than it ought to be and even worse sometimes we're viewing something said isn't that a an amazing amazing painting isn't that beautiful and come to find out it's a reproduction of something by an artist from the original and in my mind I'm thinking I want to see the original a lot of pieces of of art that I found that I really really like that were just artist practicing their craft and their skill by replicating one of the known works of their time and doing so you'll always get that artist's interpretation of what they see things that maybe they're learning things they want to emphasize things that they may want to change but when you come to the word of God God Is Right the Bible is right and the Bible is the art of God in second Peter chap 1: 20 to 21 I believe this touches on brother B saying many artist trying to paint it we know that we could paint with our words and trying to paint him in a bad picture paint you into a corner he says knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation that word is UN loosening or un unveiling and and you could have in a sense you could use that in the way of one unveiling a work of art the the prophet of God the scripture is of no private interpretation other words it cannot be presented as one's own work man cannot say I wrote this and man cannot tell that he has the sole understanding of the inspiration behind it he cannot privately interpret the art of God no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of men but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost prophet prophecy was the art of God God having allowed a man to prophesy and inspiring them to write out his prophecy others could sit and admire the work and now try to interpret it themselves it says that this should happen oh it says that he shall come doing this and now it says that and so prophecy becomes the art of God that many try to interpret but it's not until God by his power unfolds it and fulfills it that you see the true meaning of the work of art prophecy is something that God brought forth by his inspiration holy men of God spake as they removed by the Holy Ghost this is the Bible the art of God and what does man do they fabricate it cheap reproductions they they set it forth as their own original work or they guess at it and they say I think he means this and I think it means that I think this person's that and I think this is happening that's happening and men are are looking at trying to figure it out but God wrote it he's the artist the word is the art of God and God Alone knows the true meaning behind it in Philippians chap 2: 5 to8 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men there so much that we could see in this and go God created Adam and brought him forth as a stature of God in the image of God a perfect sculpture of uh manliness perfect sculpture of Womanhood in the woman and God brought forth a self-portrait perfect picture no blemish no flaw but now in this forming in making and fashioning says he was found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the de death of the Cross to make to form this likeness this fashion in all evokes the thoughts of an artist engaged in creating and this sense it's one who is going to bring forth a son who is going to be a replication of the father he's going to be in the image of the Father the Son coming forth and God the perfect artist now brings forth his son in the image of the imperfect God chooses to frame this sinless savior in a Manger in a stable and and not surrounded by Grandeur that that's how God framed it why because the man as he originally was brought forth in a perfect framing of a perfect Eden and an all inspiring picture of man a fully grown mature uh handsome man brings forth a beautiful fully mature woman who are ready to go forth and dominate the world and to populate that's a incredibly beautiful powerful picture but when God brings brings forth his son the original perfect artist God himself this perfect artist brings forth a baby lying in the manger in the image of the imperfect not as Adam in the perfect original picture but on a canvas of Fallen Humanity in flesh that was weak weary could hunger could cry could feel pain could die God did that so that we could he could reflect something in his work that we could identify with and so Paul in writing says let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus having been formed and fashion and made by his father in the likeness of man he humbled himself and became obedient to God's will he says let this mind be in you though you may be an imperfect canvas and though you may not have come forth just like Adam and even though you may not have been the sinless son that was to come into the world and die for your sins we've got to let this mind be in US this kind of [Applause] humility so that God could use us brother Bram says he made of himself no reputation now I'm struck by how brother brandom expresses this the man that made an artificial tooth made a reputation for himself is interesting I don't know who the man is uh but the one that made the real tooth made of himself no reputation now the man that makes the artificial tooth is fabricating a replica of the original and they're getting really really good now with their replications did you know that faux leather now is more desirable and more Supple and better and longer lasting and looks more beautiful than real leather that's where they've gotten that's where they're going the synthetic the the replication the fabrication is to the man is better but it's a knockoff He makes himself of no reputation the man that it has a cheap imitation of the original oh it lasts longer it'll never do this it'll never do that he says but the man who made the original tooth made himself no reputation the man that made an artificial arm made a reputation for himself God in the original brought forth something original and everything else that man would do after that is replicating perverting or working off the original and the ones that kind of rep re-represent to recreate to reset forth and rearrange they make reputations for themselves but when the great artist God came down to earth to be manifest in his son he was unrecognizable in that self-portrait he made himself of no reputation the man who made the real arm made of himself no reputation he says the Way Up Is Down always remember that and then he makes this statement be humble be sweet and kind brothers be sweet and kind be creative he says let Christ be in you now that's a really odd interposition there to Say be humble be sweet be kind let Christ be in you and we're saying y I got it I got it I got he says be creative and all the artists here are like Yay right crafts and there's a it's different to say be creative and he's not necessarily saying go out and create an atmosphere go create squirrels and bring worlds into existence it it's a phrase that we might see in a really nice calligraphy font in someone's powder bath you know be creative and nice watercolor touchings on it it evokes a thought of be creative loosen my creativity and I believe he means it let Christ be in you Christ the original Christ the original artist the one who made the arm the one that made the tooth the power that brought all worlds into existence he lives in you the great artist The Great Creator lives in you and he says be creative then in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:1 it says for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God this is a scripture we often refer to and we use the example that we relate to one another because we're are we are share the commonality of Being Human and if we ever lose sight of that that's when real problems start when we look down upon somebody else as being less human human or less deserving of life and and through our judgments we begin to create categories of humanity but we can relate to man in his suffering in his joy and his success or his failures we do so because the spirit of man is in us and the more that they study animal life and animal kind they find that there's particularities certain species and certain breeds and certain ways of thinking and acting and you'll find that we may never be able to understand and we will not be able to understand the way the animals act and think because we are not animals there is not the Affinity of spirit to be able to relate to the things that are being done sometimes we I I find myself usually if my children do something that I disagree with my first response is to ask a question I want not I don't want to do that anymore maybe comes off as too loyly uh what I'd like to be able to do is think of the question and be able to answer it for myself why are you doing that son oh yeah yeah I did the same thing yeah uhuh oh I know why he's doing that yep I did the same thing yesterday that's why he's doing it there there's ways that we we can relate we can empathize we can begin to recognize the spirit of man but he says the things of God you can't know but by the spirit of God brother brandom in the sermon he that is in you I didn't provide this quote did I I meant to he that is in you November 10th in the evening 1963 anybody want to guess what what's preached in the morning souls in prison now and he follows that up with he that is in you I don't think it was a mistake now what if tonight that you could say with all your heart that the spirit of Shakespeare lived in you that Shakespeare lived in you you know what you would do you'd do the works of Shakespeare you would you would create poems and plays and so forth because Shakespeare was the type of an artist a great write or poem writer now if Shakespeare lived in you the works of Shakespeare you would do so here's this a writer the spirit of a writer this this type of art this kind of work product this skill he says what have Beethoven lived in you you would write songs like Beethoven a great composer you would write songs like Beethoven because Beethoven would be your life you would be a Beethoven reincarnated again if Beethoven lived in you the works of Beethoven you would do because Beethoven lived in you in other words the spirit and the life of the artist is what inspires and produces the Creator's art that if the spirit of Shakespeare is in you then you have that artist Spirit you have his inspiration you would have perhaps his talents and his eye for detail and that creativity and so you'd bring forth as a writer you'd bring forth that Spirit of a writer would bring forth writings the spirit of the painter would bring forth paintings the spirit of one that composes music would bring bring forth compositions why because it's that Spirit of the Artisan that brings forth the work product for what knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man that is in him if you had the spirit of the man Shakespeare you would write uh uh sonnets and you'd write poems and you'd write plays and you'd write these great things why because that's the spirit of that artist brother B often said well if I was a Dyan I I had the spirit of Dyan I'd have a gun I'd be a shooter and he says if you had the spirit of Beethoven you'd write works of art and that's because that's the spirit of that man but verse 12 continues now we have received not the spirit of the world you have not received the spirit of Shakespeare you have not received the spirit of beethova you have not received the spirit of brother brandom there's a lot of ways that we can look at the the art of the message and we can see brother Brandon reflecting back in that in that art and many of us can try to replicate and reproduce in image of brother brandham and that's the wrong type of reproduction because we have not received the spirit of the world nor have we received the spirit of brother brandom and we don't want to take on the spirit of our pastor but we have received the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God we have received the spirit of God that we might know the things of God brother brandham says in the sermon Jehovah Gyra part one he said the spirit that was in him is on you eternal life he is The Giver of eternal life he's a redeemer to bring back that which fell in the fall in the human race to bring back to god notice the spirit that is in you is a giver a redeemer and the spirit that was in Christ is in you and if the spirit of Dylan was in me I'd have guns got a lot of brother dylans and if the spirit of Dylan was in me I'd have guns if the spirit of an artist was in me I'd paint pictures I've collected I believe every single instance where brother bam says that the spirit of an artist was in me and he says it over and over and over it's one of my largest quote collections as I've been studying this if the spirit of an artist was in me I'd paint pictures and he says if the spirit of Christ is in you the works of Christ you will do the life that was in him is in you this is why he could say be creative now this is bringing it down and maybe taken a Windy Way a long way and maybe a difficult way for you maybe you've been wrestling with it maybe I've been very clumsy and awkward and trying to express these things and I would say that God has allowed it for a reason that's very self-serving but I will still say that God's allowed it for you to wrestle with yourself to look past the canvas or the humanity to kind of try to catch what is what is God wanting me to hear through this mumble jumble my brother-in-law Jonathan sent me a uh uh a me yeser or just a quote and I think about it because you might think it's mumble jumble but it's uh it it's really just uh stuttering and babbling and he said I hate it when people accuse me of Lolly ging lollygagging when I'm clearly Dilly dallion and I was like that's nothing but the truth so I apologize for my stumbling my stuttering but there's something here that we need to see that if God in the original brought forth creation and he's expressing himself and man comes forth now God is an artist painting a self-portrait that becomes marred the Great Masterpiece is marred and now man and Satan through his agenda is completely marring God's Masterpiece changing Its Reflection changing its purpose changing its image to where the things that we now exist see and exist now are so far from the original but then in Jesus Christ God brought forth a work of art a production for us to see ourselves in that in him was the was the artist himself God in his son the power to create and maybe skipping a lot of different uh scriptures and statements and just relying on your prior knowledge now Christ in you let this mind be in you Christ in you the spirit of the artist is in us we are his we are his artwork now his spirit is in US in 2 Corinthians chap 3: 2 and 3 Paul says ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men as Paul is expressing this desire of a father these thoughts of a father that I have this writing this inspiration this work in my heart but now you have become the expression of this Vision this thing this epistle this writing in my heart has now been expressed in you so that you be come the work product of my inspiration you are now known and read of all men now lest we think that that's just merely Paul he says for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ if we want to think of epistle as a letter or a writing this is a representative work a production of Christ it's an artwork of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink painted not with paint written not with think not type with the typewriter but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart in other words Paul is using a language to say that you are a work of art expressed and there could be inspiration there could be an image there could be a desire that is embodied in the the the Christ as he's ministered and that itself represents inspiration and that as you have received that inspiration you have become the Declaration of that inspiration you yourself have become that work of art you become your life lived becomes the inter interpretation of the inspiration and as some of you artists may know there's different types of art there's so many different types of art where and influences but one thing that I last year was learning more of is Impressionism versus realism and I I don't mean I don't want to get lost in the Weeds on this because I think there's a value and benefit I think there's Beauty in both of them in art and there's a lot to be learned from the impressionist who's not his goal is not to Faithfully accurately and with great detail reflect and portray the original as it looked but rather as Van Go Star night his impression of it the way it strikes him the way he sees it I there's a there's a great Beauty in art and there's may be some value or type in in reality in the truth for us as Believers but I think the biggest problem when it comes to the word of God is there's too many impressionist and not enough realism that when God inspires the word when God word God's word comes to you do you take it and do you want to present it through your impression or can you Faithfully reflect back what it really is because you are a written epistle all scriptures given by inspiration of God the Bible is a is a work of God it is the art of God now this art of God this written word is now in your heart being lived out in you you are the manifested Declaration of the word of Christ in 2 Peter 3: 15 and 16 and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation and then he gives this example even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you I apologize for not having some of these things in there goofed on these the slideshow says Paul according to his wisdom given to him from God he's written unto you so now Paul said you are the epistle that was in our hearts we've written unto you the word you've received this word the gospel has been preached to you now you become a written epistle notice this language Peter uses as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of things in which are say things hard to be understood so as you are a living epistle you have the original work of God the art of God you see him in nature you see him in the heavens you see him in the Bible in the sky you see the written word which is the art of God you see Christ as he was on Earth he becomes this expression of God but as we have the Bible being the art of God now we have this example how that Paul's scripture the things that he wrote are in them are things hard to be understood says which they that are unlearned and unstable rest that means to twist to turn aide to torture means like to put on the rack and to twist and to cause to be painful to pervert metaphorically as one who tortures language in a deceitful way they will take as being unlearned and unstable they twist and distort the word they've taken the Epistles of Paul as he's as he's preached the word of God as Christ was declared through the gospel through his preaching through his writings there's those that seeing that and receive it then twist it and contorted he says as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction this is when we con seeed this then if the Bible as a work of art becomes a tool of the artist and now with through its inspiration it's wanting to make you thly furnished that you now become the product we sing You Are The Potter I'm the clay what is it that's Artistry that is God is an artist you are his work of art and there's a yielding to the hands of that Potter to make us as we ought to be if the word of God is to mold us and to Fashion us and to shape us then there's there's a and that's to be the the inspiration of the artist forming you painting you and bringing you forth an expression of the word what Peter is saying is that unstable and unlearned take that inspiration and begin to twist it and contort it to suit their themselves so that they as a replication as they as a work product are not accurately reflecting the artist inspiration they become a work of art that it's just a knockoff may be cheaply fabricated it's not the original it's not according to the original inspiration it's a twisted eple it's a great cover band brother loyel for Hill song songs becomes misinterpreted you're not you're not a work of art that God wants to bring forth for others to see and to hear the gospel I I'll say this and I maybe just uh expressing this it might make some sense to you I didn't necessarily bury this lead uh for on purpose but how these things were inspired to me over the last couple years and especially last year is in asking what does how how am I to live how am I to act what am I to look like what am I to sound like so that others see Christ and if we borrow from the wrong image we can actually we can try to reflect Christ in a way that to the world they're like I don't even know what that is we borrowed from the Baroque Period and we tried to present ourselves as Saints right with Halos and dress in a very Regal Way in a way that the gospel is being portrayed in an age gone by and we're trying to do it in a way that I want to reflect the spirit of Christ and nature of Christ we would only be re be cosplay of another age and so in my heart I'm thinking Lord how is it that we as men how is it we as women and children how is it as a church or as the bride of Christ how is it you're wanting to bring us forth as your work of art that will act refle accurately reflect what Christ looks like today in 2025 there's got to be a way that God desires to be seen and it's not and it's got to be such it's got to be accurate to this time period it's got to be IR relevant that's that's the inspiration to this in the sermon Serv we would see Jesus I think we read from this a moment ago where he said God is the artist of the Bible he said the Creeds today say join this say this doxology repeat the Apostles Creed join our church shake hands be baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost those are denominational Creeds and then he says the artist capital A God the artist didn't paint the picture that way the artist painted it that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has Everlast eternal life The Works that I do shall he do also these signs shall follow them that believe that's the way the painter painted it so when God reflects that you know you've struck the right painting when God reflects that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever those are my my words there so when God reflects that you know you've struck the right painting outside of that you got a bogus copy a lot of those going around anymore you got to be very careful where you order from and what you get because it's a it's a bogus copy like well I thought for sure sure this was a balency I was positive it was but it's a bogus copy take that old bogus copy of some kind of a Creed and throw that thing out the door tonight and take the Bible's Gospel Light and let the painter paint Christ in you away with the wrong mirrors the wrong replications the wrong interpretations away with the other artist trying to paint the bible let the painter God paint Christ in you that your life becomes the canvas and the way that you live and the way that you act becomes Christ in 2025 Christ in this modern times Christ in this day and age that we're living in I believe as Christians we got to go we go the opposite way but I believe that there's a fanaticism and there's an interpretation and there's an impressionist replication of what that might look like and in doing so we get further and further away from the darkness that needs our light and we become a part of the darkness I mean in this day and age in reality like the weirder you are the more they'll accept you like wow man you're really weird I like that you don't believe in this you don't believe in that I didn't know you were hip I didn't know you were cool do you eat granola too do you make your own lip gloss you know it's like everybody's just doing hipster things and making match sticks out of leftover firewood and all sorts of stuff and the world can Embrace that being weird living off the grid and doing all sorts of that that might just lump you into all the weirdos and the insane people in today's day and age so it's got to be a very sane sensible way the for the gospel to be expressed listen I'll say whether you're a scar or a hipster or or or uh whatever you might be God has got to be expressed in his unique way that he has shaped your canvas so that his voice can be heard in this hour and we can't do it through some sort of forced homogeny where everybody's the same way or being some radical looking people to where we're so far away from Humanity that the message is missed I know these things are difficult I I know to understand just well we should all do this we should all do that and it should look this way and it should act that way and I think there's some very clear tenants in the scripture of how a woman should dress how a man should look the things we should participate in the things we should enjoy and the things that we should allow there's some very clear prescriptions in scripture but these things cannot be construed to make a checklist of a way that we're all supposed to look thinking that's going to accurately portray the artwork of God in this day and age we've got to let God the painter paint Christ in US in Romans 88:9 it says but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit you're not in the spirit of Dylan you're not in the spirit of Shakespeare you're not in the spirit of Beethoven but you are in the spirit of Christ God the artist The Creator if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you but if the spirit of God dwells not in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of Christ he is none of his if I could say it this way if the spirit of Christ is not in you you are not his work product if the spirit of Christ is not in you you are not his artwork you are you are impressionism you're a fabrication you are a knockoff you cannot be the art of God you are not a new creature created in Christ Jesus you're not his creation you're not his handiwork you're not his Vineyard you're not his building and Romans 10:8 says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach the word is not just on you it's just not near you not just even in your mouth but it's in your heart the spirit of God dwelling in you brings the word to your mouth and then it'll bring it near you the spirit of the great artist God the spirit of Christ that is in you the Creator wanting to paint Christ in you will bring it to your mouth that you as a Storyteller you as an artist with your words you as a writer you that one would who say things can paint Christ with your words certain seasoning and refreshing to your speech that can portray Christ and then the word being on you near you nigh you not only you're a creator of an atmosphere but the image that God has created in your life can preach the word Christ it's another Masterpiece being created another unveiling of a great work of art in this day in the sermon Jehovah Gyra part two brother brah is speaking about Abraham and how they just held to that promise that she would bring forth a son holding to God's word holding to the word because God Said So no matter what the Creeds that covered it up still that word laid there it had to come that word laying in Abraham's heart no matter how many says the days of this is gone and that there I want you to think of it this for yourself wherever wherever you sit today if if you have not the spirit of Christ search it with everything that is in you everything that is in you if you put if you had some New Year's resolution of what you wanted to do you had a bucket list this year you should get desperate about being born again and say Lord I I know that I I'm not where I need to be I know I haven't fully surrendered I haven't I haven't repented of my sins I haven't been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I I I I need to call upon God for Revelation I need to experience this new birth get desperate about that become the desperate man amen seeking and searching after the power of God to Quicken you and to change you so you can have the spirit of God inside of you and if you feel and believe and know that you have been born again and that the word is not just around you and not just in your mouth but it is in your mouth and around you because the word is now original in your heart and the spirit of God is inside of you with this directive to be creative I want you to take heart in that word is powerful this word that is in you it is the spirit of Christ that is making you his that is making you the art of God that is bringing you forth as a manifestation of the word of God the word is in your heart hold to it like Abraham did hold to it like Sarah did because brother says as long as that word is laying there it will be creative Lord as long as that word is laying there I think in some ways we could maybe preach this to where we all just want to go out and make friendship bracelets or start painting pictures and brother regie I just forgot you've become a budding artist over the last couple years maybe you could really relate to these things maybe he's the one that pulled me into this channel after all but there's ways that we can say this inspires me for art and I want to go to an art museum and I want to paint pictures and I want to do that all wonderful things that there some of these things are good Recreation a good use of your time uh but because there's good art there's bad art right but we maybe all known a bad art in our days and there's things that are positive there's things that can be very very negative but my inspiration is not to drive us into that type of creativity but to recognize that if God says be creative that me is a vessel of God me being a canvas me being flesh that the word is laying there and as long as that word is laying there it will be creative because it's a deratization [Applause] of God's Vision God's desire you are the art of God I know there's a a maybe a play on words in there and it's not intentional that they have the heart of God the purpose of God the desire of God and if there's anything maybe to help it make it click that if there's the heart of God you are the expression of it it's laying there it will be creative in other words if we can get out of the painter's way if we can stop trying to rest and twist the way that it's to look like and to present ourselves in a way that we think it should look he'll paint Christ in you I I I'll say this en closing musicians feel free to come to your instruments I I I just ask God to help me to say this let me give you an analogy that there's some that really lock up and I have had great fellowship with Brothers on this subject and heard it ministered to where there are artificial barriers that begin to be placed on predestination and the reason is is that if you preach predestination too much then people will take that as a sign or permission to go in sin and there's that that teaching of predestination that becomes rotten nonsense and it's that interpretation the impression that people get from the word of God that says that pre you're predestinated you cannot be lost that once saved always saved and we realize well there's a truth to that but then it can become perverted and recognizing all the people that have perverted the the the the expression of predestination what we can do is begin to put artificial restraints and barriers on the creativity of Christ in in other words say well there's no predestination there's no this and no that and we try to massage it and change it to where the picture makes more sense and I say that to say this that there is maybe a caution there can be a little bit of nervousness about setting forth an individualistic expression of Christ in each person and removing all the artificial barriers and constraints on God's creativity in trusting God's word and the spirit of Christ in you to bring forth the work of art that he's creating and not take so much just it's as if we're standing over the shoulder of God and going really they're going to let them do that let's change that instead of just saying Lord You're the Potter now if it's contrary to the word look at the artist real quick how'd you get over here right we want to be Christ we want to be according to his word there's a there's sufficient detail in the message of the hour in the word of God for us to be able to look at the fruits of something and say that that's not the word of God but where we have rested and we've twisted and we've tried to come up with these cheap knockoffs where we're all just homogenized and we all just become in our own H uh Echo chambers of the message and we try to reproduce the these message Believers I wrote a song when I was a young message believer it's it's like a I got my uh my belt buckle and my STS and hat I'm on my way and we did a nice little diddy we used to sing around a campfire and there was this where you could create this this image of a message believer do you hunt do you drive this and do you have a belt buckle and do you have a picture of the cloud and right have you rubbed the stone on an Easter yet right there's just a way where we just created some sort of uh Co message cosplay and we and our conventions become nothing but cosplay special meetings nothing but cosplay and invite this Creator invite that Creator invite this influencer and it's it's its own world that's so far away from reality and so maybe we find that there's some safety in that and structure and the and these are the parameters but I believe that if we are artificially restricting God's creativity it'll never produce this masterpiece I'm not advocating that anything goes but I'm advocating that we've got to let God have his way to let him mold us and to make us and Lord if you want to express yourself in me then I want you to express yourself in me I believe we can trust God to do that I may in my language be using may seem to give uh some of you may feel like well this is a lot of latitude that God's going to be expressed in different cultures and ideas and Lifestyles and I want to be the example to this and I want to be example to that and and you might use it as an excuse to find your way in com into compromise but I will say this the word is no pushover God is not a a a pushover he's not Doty you will not get away from it and if you will hold yourself accountable to the word of God the word will not let you get away with it and say ah you know you're just justifying it I was at a um a function one time in law school a good friend of mine he went to Seminary we had many many wonderful times of Fellowship around the word of God and a lengthy discussion on water baptism and finally at the end of the conclusion he said wow you know what Aaron I think you may be right and that was the end of it right because it was just about oh you may be right and we were sitting at a function one time and he was holding a beer he's drinking a beer and he's a minister he's a theologian he's a has a position in this church he was in and he was like why areen you drinking I'm like because the word of God he goes well I mean even the Bible says a little Wine's good for the belly I'm like cores since when has that been a little wine right and I just looked at me and I said Stephen you know you're using that scripture to justify something that's wrong and he was exposed in that moment and I trust that the word of God will do that for some of us here constantly and consistently resting and twisting the word to suit our own picture Lord I'm done playing games hash no filter I want to be an accurate reflection of the word of God in this hour and not contrive myself to be some uh uh somebody destitute and humble a and and lacking certain things because that's what the word says I should be or nor do I want to be opulent and extravagant in some sort of religious spiritual way because that's what I think the world says I should or the word says I should be or try too hard to be worldly so that you can be a hip message believer God I just want to be what you need me to be in this hour let me pray for you as we stand together and if brother Michael could be ready to come and sing I'd appreciate that communion today at 4:00 let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer with your heads bowed if anyone would like prayer today and there's just a particular need you might have in your heart just lift your hand to the Lord whatever the may be if it's very precise as to these things we ministered this morning it's in your heart I'm not uh making a specific call except that if you desire prayer and there's a need that you have just lift your hand let's pray our heavenly father Lord I just felt a a a nervousness today Lord as I ministered I don't know that maybe I was myself and may maybe there's a good in that but Lord I ask that you for forgive me for whatever failures and lack of faithfulness in my own life that would have hindered me today and just been a barrier I trust that for me it was only felt and seen on my end and that you have found good ground today that your word penetrated it made spiritual sense Lord Brother Bram said in many different places that he was a lover of art he told certain stories many times of him visiting uh museums and admiring [Music] art and I I myself feeling the same way and admiring certain artist and having read books and studying and trying to understand more about the creative Pro process and those different things I I realized that it can seem from one glance to be entirely carnal but Lord I pray that you would help the believer to recognize this great challenge today in the in this hour is that the brightest light that's going to shine is going to be the image in the image of a man or a woman a child a teenager that looks like all the other canvases in the world today that we are not just Amber orbs floating through the world and people seeing us a a as these mystical creatures of light with great powers are drawn to something Beyond themselves and cry out that they too could become these mythical orbs but Lord we've got to be Christ in humanity that there's still a badger skin there's still a veil there's still a canvas that looks lot like other humans but in the way that we live and the way that we act we are expressing the holy and Lord that was one of the Great [Music] wrestlingspotlight Halos and perfect expressions of religious artifacts then it's never real to us it's unattainable so God I pray that we could become bearers of light to help us oh Lord to overcome Prejudice and resting and twisting and cosplay to become the very art of God in this day and age I want to know how to live like you Lord I want to know what it looks like in this day and age I want to know what it sounds like Lord we can't just all download playlist of gorian chants and pipe music and and try to create some sort of somber holy religious order Lord how is it reflected in my music how is it reflected in My Worship how is it reflected in my dress how is it reflected in my obedience and my Recreation how Lord can I pursue certain Endeavors and likes in a way that brings you glory and also testifies accurately of your nature and your character that I do not use so many artificial man-made constraints that I create a lab that with one breach it just causes such great infection and contamination that the old system falls apart but Lord may I be able to enter into the world as a sheep among wolves with a life and a power so strong that it's inoculated against infection and yet has such great power that by the virtue of my life it can cause others to be influenced and to be transformed into an art of God we're praying today for us as a church I'm praying today for our families I'm praying today for myself we are on this great Battlefield and we must choose right now whether or not we'll let you paint Christ in US or we stubbornly choose to paint our own self-portrait help us Lord I pray as I ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
