[0:00] standing together let's turn to ruth
[0:01] chapter one
[0:04] and ruth chapter one i'd like to read
[0:05] verses 19 to 22.
[0:08] we're coming to the end here of
[0:13] chapter one and we've taken a little bit
[0:16] different title we had been ministering
[0:18] um on the bread of life and kind of
[0:21] began with that thought on being hungry
[0:23] and the hunger and thirst that's within
[0:24] the bride's heart for the word of god
[0:26] and we're gonna change the titling now a
[0:29] little bit
[0:30] but we're still in the book of ruth to
[0:31] bringing forth the bride so we were
[0:33] talking about the bread of life
[0:36] and now we're looking on the bride
[0:37] coming forth there's something that
[0:38] brings her forth
[0:40] and calls her on the scene ruth chapter
[0:42] 1 verse 19. so they
[0:45] too went until they came to bethlehem
[0:47] and it came to pass when they were
[0:49] come to bethlehem that all the city was
[0:52] moved about them
[0:53] and they said and that they theirs in
[0:55] the in the hebrew is feminine
[0:57] and so it really speaks of the women the
[0:58] women said is this naomi
[1:01] and she said unto them call me not naomi
[1:04] call me mara the almighty have dealt
[1:06] very bitterly with me
[1:08] i went out full and the lord hath
[1:09] brought me home again empty
[1:11] why then call ye me naomi seeing the
[1:14] lord hath
[1:15] testified against me and the almighty
[1:16] hath afflicted me
[1:18] so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess
[1:21] her daughter-in-law
[1:22] with her which returned out of the
[1:24] country of moab
[1:26] and they came to bethlehem in the
[1:28] beginning
[1:29] of the barley harvest it was actually
[1:31] that phrase i think we begin with
[1:33] come to bethlehem it says they came to
[1:35] bethlehem
[1:36] in the beginning of the barley harvest
[1:39] if we could just bow our heads in prayer
[1:41] heavenly father as we stand in your
[1:43] divine presence this evening we're so
[1:44] grateful for
[1:46] the blessings that you have poured out
[1:48] upon us
[1:49] lord those are the ones that we're
[1:50] conscious of we thank you for them and
[1:52] there's so many that if we
[1:54] began to offer thanksgiving we would
[1:56] find ourselves
[1:58] just over and over again thinking of
[1:59] something new and something
[2:02] recent and even things from our past so
[2:04] significant we begin to pour out
[2:07] praise to you and thanksgiving and lord
[2:10] those are just the things that we are
[2:11] mindful of and conscious of and things
[2:13] that we have recognized
[2:14] surely lord there's so many things that
[2:16] you do on a daily basis
[2:18] and moment to moment to protect us and
[2:20] to keep us and already making provisions
[2:23] in the future for us in the present time
[2:26] that we're not even aware of so we just
[2:27] give you thanksgiving
[2:29] to be something lacking right now in our
[2:31] lives whether it be physical or
[2:32] financial or emotional
[2:34] we can just thank you knowing that
[2:37] you're already setting things in motion
[2:39] to meet that need
[2:40] and though we may not see it now lord
[2:42] may we just believe by faith that it's
[2:44] coming
[2:45] i ask that you encourage the people
[2:46] tonight as they have gathered together
[2:48] not for church lord but for
[2:50] communion with you may you commune with
[2:52] them through the word
[2:53] may you speak to them and encourage them
[2:54] and comfort them we ask that you take
[2:57] the words which we've read tonight
[2:58] and just unfold them to us as a in a way
[3:00] that only you can
[3:02] bless us now we pray in the name of the
[3:03] lord jesus christ amen
[3:06] and you may be seated so the
[3:09] statement that we've been working from
[3:11] is from the rapture when brother
[3:12] branham's identifying
[3:13] the shout voice and trump and he refers
[3:16] to
[3:17] the shout as the message or a message
[3:20] and you know he talks about a messenger
[3:22] and then he says he makes the statement
[3:24] the living
[3:25] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[3:28] and uh it's he doesn't quite say that
[3:32] um in that those details really anywhere
[3:34] else that's specifically the living
[3:36] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[3:38] but you'll find there's a number of
[3:39] different places and we'll touch on a
[3:40] few of them tonight
[3:42] where he's using this thought of a
[3:45] birthing forth and a bringing forth of
[3:47] the body of christ
[3:48] and coming on the scene for the bride
[3:51] and so he
[3:51] uses his phrase the living bread of life
[3:54] bringing forth it's from this living
[3:56] bread of life
[3:57] and the characteristics and the dynamics
[3:59] of this living bread of life that brings
[4:01] forth the bride
[4:02] and i personally have been looking at
[4:04] this phrase the living bread of life
[4:06] bringing forth the bride
[4:08] and identifying how it's portrayed in
[4:10] ruth so when we begin in verse 1
[4:12] and begin to go just very methodically
[4:14] through each verse we can see
[4:16] that there's a bringing forth of ruth
[4:17] there's a coming of ruth out of moab
[4:20] into into bethlehem judah and
[4:23] this is this is portraying even our
[4:26] journey as individuals
[4:27] and we see this beautiful type of the
[4:29] bride in
[4:30] roof and when he says this phrase
[4:32] bringing forth i was pondering the
[4:34] meaning of this phrase this week
[4:36] and it means to give birth to so it
[4:38] could be to bring forth i would suggest
[4:40] even a birthing or
[4:42] to produce the bringing forth is to
[4:44] produce or to give
[4:45] rise to so something raises up as the
[4:47] result of something
[4:49] and it even speaks of an introduction if
[4:51] something brings forth something they're
[4:53] introducing it they're forerunning it if
[4:54] something is
[4:56] bringing forth they produce it or they
[4:57] give birth to it they give
[4:59] rise to it so it's the living bread of
[5:01] life
[5:02] that produces the bride it's the living
[5:05] bread of life that's
[5:06] bringing giving rise to the bride
[5:09] and in john chapter 6 verse 35 and we
[5:12] looked at several of these scriptures at
[5:14] the outset and jesus said unto them
[5:16] i am the bread of life they're looking
[5:18] to natural bread that may feed the
[5:20] natural body
[5:20] now he begins to speak in the spiritual
[5:22] sense i am
[5:24] the bread of life he that cometh to me
[5:26] shall never hunger
[5:27] and he that believeth on me shall never
[5:29] thirst so christ is the one that
[5:32] satisfies the thirst christ is the one
[5:34] that satisfies the hunger and we know
[5:37] that food is an attraction
[5:39] i don't know in our church experience
[5:40] and i look out upon a congregation
[5:42] that's probably spent
[5:43] um all their lives um if not most of
[5:45] their lives in church and you'll
[5:47] find that there's certain times when you
[5:49] have a church function and there's
[5:50] people that'll show up when there's a
[5:52] when there's a meal that never come
[5:54] otherwise
[5:55] and i've i've had church experiences
[5:57] where you could have a church service
[5:59] and a meal afterwards and people
[6:01] actually show up for the meal not for
[6:02] the church service
[6:04] or you could have a wedding they don't
[6:05] come for the wedding but they come for
[6:06] the wedding reception because there's
[6:08] free food
[6:09] and so food can be quite a tremendous
[6:11] attraction can i get an amen
[6:13] food can be a great attraction and so
[6:15] there is
[6:17] christ then in that kind of that thought
[6:18] process he says i am the bread of life
[6:21] and since it's not a bread that everyone
[6:23] desires and it's not a bread that
[6:25] everyone's
[6:26] aware of yet to the elect they
[6:29] recognize and through their own hunger
[6:31] that they have the spiritual hunger that
[6:32] they have
[6:33] him being the bread of life and him
[6:36] being the
[6:36] water this well of living water he
[6:39] becomes an attraction and that's what
[6:41] causes them to come forth
[6:42] there's no bread there's no well then
[6:44] they just remain in their state of need
[6:46] in their state of desperation their
[6:48] state of crying out but what we can
[6:49] begin to identify and recognize is that
[6:52] christ
[6:52] the bread of life appears makes himself
[6:55] known
[6:55] calls to your heart and it's it's that
[6:58] that brings the bride out of you
[7:00] we can look at our lives and say well i
[7:01] haven't always acted like the bride i
[7:03] haven't i've always acted like
[7:05] i acted like the elect but it was in you
[7:08] the election was always in you bride
[7:09] material is
[7:10] in you the calling is in you and but
[7:12] what it takes to bring that out of you
[7:14] is christ
[7:15] and so if there's a little bit too much
[7:17] of you that you see these days and you
[7:18] look in the mirror and you don't like
[7:19] what you see
[7:20] then let's stop looking at natural
[7:22] things look to supernatural things look
[7:24] more to the word
[7:26] as brother israel poe would say you know
[7:28] read the bible man
[7:30] get into the word of god and that's
[7:31] going to bring out the deity in you
[7:33] it's going to be the it's going to be
[7:34] what brings it out so christ says
[7:36] i am the bread of life he that cometh to
[7:39] me so it's a draw it's an attraction
[7:42] it's what brings you forth and so it's
[7:44] christ when brother bram says the living
[7:46] bread of life
[7:46] bringing forth the bride there has to be
[7:48] a manifestation and a revealing of
[7:51] christ
[7:52] in order to bring forth the bride that
[7:55] has to be
[7:56] that that's what draws her forth and
[7:58] just a way of trying to help you to
[7:59] understand
[8:00] and i know that this has been expressed
[8:01] to you before that even in our
[8:03] our western uh wedding uh ceremonies
[8:06] it's the bridegroom that makes his
[8:08] appearance first and that lets you know
[8:10] ceremony's on it's begun there's times
[8:13] you can wait and wait and wait and wait
[8:14] and wait
[8:15] and you know when is this thing's going
[8:16] to kick off when did this thing begin
[8:18] but as soon as the bridegroom comes
[8:19] forth from that chamber and takes his
[8:21] position on the platform
[8:22] you know that things have been set in
[8:23] motion and if he's not there at the
[8:26] platform
[8:26] she's not going to be coming forth the
[8:28] bride is not going to come forth down
[8:30] the aisle
[8:31] and so it's him his presence is the
[8:34] bridegroom
[8:35] that becomes the draw and the attraction
[8:37] for the bride to come forth and so it's
[8:38] christ
[8:39] that brings forth the bride now if
[8:42] you'll look in ruth chapter 1
[8:44] and we were skipping over verse 19 i
[8:47] guess in our slides and didn't
[8:48] necessarily uh wasn't trying to make any
[8:51] point in doing that but it says so they
[8:53] went
[8:54] until they came to bethlehem naomi ruth
[8:56] are coming to bethlehem
[8:58] and as they come they they come to the
[9:01] city
[9:02] people recognize them recognize naomi
[9:04] everyone recognizes
[9:06] recognizes naomi and and it said in such
[9:08] a way to where it would seem like they
[9:10] were together and there was a group
[9:11] even in some some of the writings and
[9:13] commentaries they say that they were
[9:15] coming back from the offering of a feast
[9:17] and they were coming back from
[9:18] uh from one of these festivals and as
[9:20] they came back and these people
[9:21] are all together there in the city and
[9:23] they see
[9:24] naomi coming and the people are moved
[9:26] and then the women say oh isn't this
[9:28] naomi
[9:29] and one of the things that stands out
[9:32] when you read this and i'm kind of maybe
[9:33] just backtracking on some of the things
[9:35] we discussed before
[9:37] i it really it kind of narrows it down
[9:39] to recognize
[9:40] that elimelech may have been one of few
[9:42] who fled
[9:44] even to the point where it was that
[9:46] their presence was missed and when they
[9:47] see them coming back
[9:48] they recognize them as coming back and
[9:50] she's identified as this naomi
[9:52] now verse 20 and naomi responded and is
[9:55] this naomi she said to them call me not
[9:57] naomi which that was beautiful or
[9:59] pleasant is what that name meant
[10:01] call me mara for the almighty and she's
[10:04] identifying god as being the one that
[10:06] has uh power and control over her and
[10:08] giving him
[10:09] uh the the liberty and the uh
[10:12] to to address her or to deal with her
[10:14] have dealt very
[10:15] bitterly with me so naomi which means
[10:18] beautiful pleasant she's saying my
[10:20] pleasantness
[10:21] has been turned to bitterness of soul
[10:23] don't call me naomi anymore that that
[10:25] evokes
[10:26] an image of somebody who's pleasant and
[10:28] somebody who is beautiful
[10:29] but i'm coming back bitter in soul
[10:31] because i've suffered
[10:32] great loss and she amplifies that in
[10:35] verse 22.
[10:37] uh excuse me for 21. i went out full i
[10:40] left with the husband and two sons that
[10:42] would would seem to be very wealthy for
[10:43] a woman and a family to have two sons
[10:45] and there's going to be this
[10:46] legacy that will be passed down i went
[10:48] out full and the lord notice she's
[10:50] talking about the lord the lord hath
[10:52] brought me home again
[10:53] md i left with a husband and two sons i
[10:56] come back with neither my husband
[10:58] nor my two sons i'm coming back empty
[11:00] and she's now
[11:02] i want you to this is something i want
[11:04] you to focus on she's
[11:05] recognizing the providence of god
[11:08] the almighty has dealt very bitterly
[11:10] with me see and she says
[11:12] so why then call ye me naomi seeing the
[11:15] lord hath testified against me
[11:17] and the almighty hath afflicted me she's
[11:21] recognizing the hand of god these things
[11:23] are by the hand of god
[11:25] if naomi could testify she could have
[11:26] said elimelech and i knew that we were
[11:29] disobeying god when we left we thought
[11:31] it would just be our first season
[11:32] but we've suffered greatly because of
[11:34] this so i'm coming back because god has
[11:36] judged me correctly he's testified
[11:39] against me he's afflicted me in our own
[11:40] disobedience and so she's recognizing
[11:43] the providence of god
[11:45] and it's him the lord notice this phrase
[11:48] the lord hath
[11:49] brought me home so it is the hand of god
[11:52] is the providence of god
[11:53] that is bringing her home and as she's
[11:56] bringing
[11:57] her home she's bringing ruth with her so
[12:00] i
[12:00] this is the connection we'd like to make
[12:02] the lord hath brought me home again
[12:04] but it's not just naomi it's ruth so if
[12:07] the lord's bringing naomi
[12:08] the lord's also bringing ruth and the
[12:10] next verse speaks to it verse 22 saying
[12:12] naomi returned
[12:14] and ruth the moabitess the lord hath
[12:16] brought naomi home again
[12:18] and the lord hath brought ruth the
[12:20] moabitess her daughter-in-law with her
[12:23] which returned out of the country of
[12:25] moab
[12:26] and this beautiful phrase that we're
[12:27] going to focus on some more tonight and
[12:29] they came to bethlehem
[12:31] in the beginning of the barley harvest
[12:35] and this is the phrase i'd like to
[12:37] amplify
[12:39] but as this is broken up into chapters
[12:42] and verses
[12:43] this verse 22 and this phrase they came
[12:45] to bethlehem in the beginning of the
[12:46] barley harvest
[12:47] this is the conclusion of this
[12:49] tremendous chapter
[12:51] which introduces the story of ruth
[12:54] so we read this love story we think of
[12:56] all the things that have been said about
[12:57] it more than just a love story but god
[12:59] reveals himself
[13:00] in this and it brings out something
[13:02] about the bride in the last days
[13:04] as this scene ruth begins with uh with
[13:07] disobedience and two three different
[13:09] funerals and
[13:10] and death begins and it comes upon this
[13:12] family as it's
[13:13] trying to come to this introduction of
[13:15] ruth this is probably
[13:17] this is the point that kind of seals in
[13:19] the scene it sets the scene
[13:21] the story's been told now we can begin
[13:23] to focus more particularly on the events
[13:25] that take place because
[13:27] from the moment that it begins in verse
[13:29] 1 there's a lot of years that are
[13:30] covered but now
[13:31] we're going to begin to cover events
[13:33] that transpire within a very short
[13:34] period of time
[13:35] and the scene has been set and this
[13:37] phrase they come to bethlehem at the
[13:39] beginning of the barley season
[13:41] is this climactic conclusion of this
[13:43] introductory chapter
[13:45] and it's from this point on that we can
[13:46] say the events in ruth begin to center
[13:48] around what the harvest
[13:51] the things that you begin to read in
[13:52] chapter two and chapter three
[13:54] and even in chapter four are are events
[13:57] that are surrounded by
[13:58] and taking place during the harvest time
[14:01] so that gets our attention
[14:02] we're living in the harvest time ruth
[14:04] being a type of the bride we would
[14:05] it's very uh i guess maybe apparent to
[14:08] us or obvious
[14:10] that if she represents the bride things
[14:12] that would be taking place in her life
[14:13] would transpire during
[14:15] the harvest time because that's when the
[14:17] bride comes on the scene is during the
[14:18] rapture time of the harvest time
[14:21] and the harvesting of barley is it's
[14:23] going to identify here that they came to
[14:24] bethlehem in the beginning of the
[14:26] barley harvest there were several phases
[14:28] or stages
[14:29] to the barley harvest there was a time
[14:32] in which they would cut things down and
[14:33] they'd be gathered into
[14:35] and they'd be put into these sheaves and
[14:37] they would be and there's omers and they
[14:39] would be placed together
[14:40] and so there's a cutting down of the
[14:42] barley then there's an actual gathering
[14:44] of the
[14:44] barley and then there's a um there's a
[14:47] place in it on the threshing floor
[14:49] and on the threshing floor it would be
[14:50] um crushed and it would separate
[14:52] uh it kind of break up that husk or that
[14:54] that that shuck
[14:56] and then that would be winnowed into the
[14:57] wind and it would blow away the
[14:59] shock and the barley would fall to the
[15:00] ground and this was kind of a process
[15:03] of of harvesting the barley there was
[15:05] phases and stages to this harvesting
[15:07] process
[15:09] and and it's uh
[15:12] i know that we've expressed this and you
[15:14] recognize this so i
[15:16] i don't want you to think well my
[15:17] brother aaron really thinks this is
[15:18] really profound
[15:20] um i'm just maybe saying it for my own
[15:22] benefit but the phrase the beginning of
[15:24] the barley harvest
[15:27] it's an important context to recognize
[15:29] that and focus on that in order to
[15:30] understand
[15:32] the type of ruth for us
[15:35] as we could say that orpah who
[15:37] represents the laodicean church
[15:39] represents that nominal believer that
[15:41] lukewarm
[15:42] church she is separated from ruth who
[15:45] represents the bride
[15:47] that has just happened in ruth chapter
[15:49] one by the end the end of chapter one
[15:51] and so now ruth is coming to uh to
[15:54] bethlehem jude at the time of the barley
[15:55] harvest and she's already kind of going
[15:57] through this process herself
[15:59] even in the story of ruth but then also
[16:01] for the bride as we can see that there's
[16:02] going to be a
[16:03] separation from the shock for the bride
[16:05] there's going to be a the bride is going
[16:07] to
[16:07] be made manifest this is now ruth that
[16:10] is brought forth in chapter two and the
[16:11] story is going to focus on her
[16:13] and unfold more particularly upon her
[16:16] and the message this day this scripture
[16:18] is fulfilled
[16:20] he says now we find out the condition of
[16:22] the world we see where the church normal
[16:25] he uses that phrase actually of orpah
[16:26] the church normal we might think well
[16:28] he's talking about nominal and
[16:30] yes the normal church the nominal church
[16:33] uh the church organization
[16:34] denomination we see where they are they
[16:37] are identified they have made themselves
[16:39] known they have
[16:40] they have identified that they want to
[16:42] go back to what they were they don't
[16:43] want to follow the word of the hour we
[16:45] see where they're
[16:46] where the nations are and we see that
[16:48] this day
[16:49] these promises is fulfilled
[16:52] now but in this this day there is to
[16:55] come a
[16:55] super royal seed of abraham so ruth is
[16:59] ruth is represents this grain this seed
[17:01] that's exactly what it would be
[17:03] would be a royal bride to the royal
[17:05] promised son
[17:07] you know this this book is going to come
[17:09] to a union a marriage
[17:10] ruth is going to marry boaz and so here
[17:12] we see a royal seat of abraham we see
[17:14] the church world we see orpah
[17:16] we see the nominal world we see the luke
[17:18] 1 word we see the make-believer an
[17:19] unbeliever
[17:20] but there's to be a royal seed of
[17:21] abraham a royal bride to the royal
[17:23] promised son
[17:24] he says as i spoke last night it won't
[17:27] be a natural seed
[17:28] it'll be a spiritual seed he says there
[17:31] is to
[17:32] be a spiritual bride raise up
[17:35] if there's going to be a spiritual bride
[17:37] raise up there's got to be something to
[17:39] give rise to her got to be something
[17:41] that brings her forth the living bread
[17:43] of life
[17:43] bringing forth the bride there's to be
[17:45] spiritual bride raise up which will be
[17:48] the royal seed
[17:49] of the royal faith of abraham's royal
[17:51] son
[17:52] there is to be a spiritual bride raise
[17:55] up
[17:56] she is to come on the scene in the last
[17:58] days
[17:59] and the time and the place is the
[18:01] promise that's given to her
[18:03] so this is what we see in ruth ruth
[18:06] comes on the scene
[18:07] and no one and i don't know how news
[18:10] necessarily traveled in those days i
[18:11] often marvel
[18:12] at how you're reading a story in the old
[18:14] testament and something takes place and
[18:15] they're able to get a message to someone
[18:17] very precisely at just the right time
[18:19] and so they had a way for things for
[18:21] messages to be conveyed
[18:23] i know sometimes for us we think man
[18:24] what would we do if we didn't have cell
[18:26] phones when we landed at the airport
[18:27] well we did it for decades
[18:29] and you just happen to find the person
[18:31] you're looking for you are able to
[18:32] convey the information you need to
[18:34] convey
[18:35] and so i don't know how information
[18:36] traveled then i wasn't there present to
[18:38] know
[18:39] but we don't know that there had been
[18:41] maybe much knowledge of what was taking
[18:43] place with naomi and elimelech
[18:44] so it wouldn't be that everyone's
[18:46] expecting ruth to show up not everyone's
[18:48] expecting oh wow we knew this would
[18:50] happen and we knew this is the way that
[18:51] it would be and we made everything ready
[18:53] but she comes on the scene and she's
[18:56] making her appearance in ruth chapter
[18:58] two which
[18:58] at the end of chapter one and into
[19:00] chapter two and it's a type of the
[19:02] spiritual bride that's raising up
[19:04] she has to come on the scene she is to
[19:07] come forth in the last days
[19:09] and the time and the place is her
[19:11] promise
[19:12] so there's a promised place for the
[19:14] bride to come to there is a promised
[19:16] time
[19:17] for the bride to come on the scene and
[19:19] in the book of ruth it's at the
[19:21] beginning of the barley harvest
[19:23] that ruth comes forth and it's at the
[19:26] harvest time that the bride comes forth
[19:29] the beginning of the barley harvest
[19:30] would have been in the early spring and
[19:32] that might seem a little bit
[19:33] counterintuitive to how we recognize
[19:36] our harvest times but there was a
[19:38] planting in the fall and the fall rains
[19:40] and then the beginning of the barley
[19:41] harvest would have been in the
[19:42] springtime there in israel
[19:44] and when the this phrase is used and i
[19:47] can't go into
[19:48] i can't even begin to scratch the
[19:49] surface as a matter of fact i wouldn't
[19:51] even try to imply
[19:52] that i'm skipping the surface let's just
[19:53] say i'm kind of pointing to the surface
[19:56] saying hey this is identifying a very
[19:58] very deep pool there's a lot of stuff
[20:00] here
[20:01] and using the phrase that she comes they
[20:03] come to bethlehem judah at the beginning
[20:05] this phrase
[20:06] the beginning the barley harvest
[20:08] immediately draws certain feast days
[20:09] into view
[20:11] that if this is the time that they're
[20:12] coming even though the scripture is
[20:13] silent about it
[20:15] it's kind of pointing to the season that
[20:17] ruth would be coming forth
[20:18] and in doing so i want to take just a
[20:20] few moments tonight
[20:22] and just point to the fact that this is
[20:24] the truth that's being highlighted
[20:26] and being emphasized if the lord would
[20:27] lead us to go deeper into it i know that
[20:29] i would certainly be excited about it
[20:31] but i don't pursue my own uh my own
[20:34] agenda and even the things that i want
[20:36] to study
[20:36] when it comes to the word of god you all
[20:38] have done a tremendous job in praying
[20:41] uh in such a way that burdens me and i
[20:42] know that's the direction i need to go
[20:44] and it's not the way i'm wanting to go
[20:45] i'm not throwing darts coming up with
[20:47] something
[20:47] i'm not playing divining by the bible
[20:49] and just flipping things open your
[20:51] prayers
[20:51] burdened the servant's heart and he and
[20:54] he goes by that burden and so if that
[20:56] would be the
[20:57] what lord would want to do we'll get
[20:58] into it but i want to just point to and
[21:00] i feel led to just
[21:01] point to these feasts point to this
[21:03] season and point to this time
[21:05] and begin to get us to think man there's
[21:07] a lot that's represented in these things
[21:09] that have this uh relevance to the story
[21:11] of ruth and the relevance to us as a
[21:13] bride
[21:14] and so these feasts that would come into
[21:16] view at the beginning of the barley
[21:17] harvest
[21:18] the feast of the passover would have
[21:20] been in the beginning of the year for
[21:22] them the first month being
[21:23] nissan which corresponds to our march or
[21:25] april but in the in the scripture
[21:27] in the 14th day of the sun they began
[21:30] they had the feast of the passover
[21:33] and we know that was instituted in the
[21:35] exodus that when the death angel was
[21:37] going to be
[21:37] passing through is egypt they had to
[21:41] apply the token upon the doorpost and
[21:43] the lintel they had to be
[21:44] in inside dressed a particular way and
[21:46] they had to draw
[21:47] a lamb without blemish of one year and
[21:50] they had to roast it
[21:52] and they had to serve it eat it and eat
[21:54] everything of it
[21:55] and they were eating the lamb and that's
[21:56] why it's called the paschal lamb or the
[21:58] passover lamb
[21:59] and as they were eating it the death
[22:01] angel went through egypt and smote
[22:03] everyone who did not have the token
[22:04] applied
[22:05] and god said this will be the beginning
[22:07] of months for you this is going to be a
[22:08] memorial to this is going to begin your
[22:10] calendar
[22:11] and that began their calendar he says
[22:12] this is a feast that you'll keep through
[22:14] all generations
[22:15] so it was instituted and it became a
[22:17] permanent feast for them
[22:20] and so this feast would have been
[22:21] celebrated about that this time that
[22:23] ruth is coming
[22:24] at the beginning of the barley harvest
[22:26] the feast of the passover is celebrated
[22:28] in that time
[22:30] and then the on the 14th day of the sun
[22:32] they would have the feast of the
[22:33] passover then the very next day on the
[22:35] 15th of the sun they would have the
[22:37] feast of unleavened bread
[22:38] and it would begin that day that sabbath
[22:41] would begin
[22:42] the feast of unleavened bread and that
[22:43] would be kept for seven days
[22:45] for seven days they would eat unleavened
[22:48] bread we find that also in the exodus
[22:50] they were to get
[22:51] all the yeast out of their homes and
[22:53] purge themselves of all the east and for
[22:54] seven days they would eat unleavened
[22:56] bread
[22:57] so this is instituted in their feast you
[22:59] have the feast of the passover
[23:00] then you have this feast of unleavened
[23:03] bread that comes next and they would
[23:04] observe that on the 15th
[23:06] and then the day after after the
[23:10] as it would and i don't want to get
[23:11] maybe into the all the different ways
[23:13] that these
[23:14] the calendar could fall but in the
[23:18] in the way that it was designed and
[23:20] celebrated you have on the 14th
[23:22] the feast of the passover the 15th of
[23:24] nisan you'd have the the feast of
[23:26] unleavened bread
[23:27] and then the day after that after that
[23:29] sabbath day they would have the feast of
[23:31] the first fruits
[23:33] and what they would do is the first
[23:35] grain that is harvested would be brought
[23:37] to the temple and offered on the altar
[23:39] on the sunday after that sabbath of the
[23:41] feast of the unleavened bread
[23:43] so you'd have a feast of the passover
[23:45] feast of unleavened bread
[23:46] and then on the sunday you'd have they
[23:48] would come and they would offer the
[23:49] first grain bring it into the temple
[23:51] it'd be offered
[23:52] and they'd make this offering on that we
[23:54] call it sunday
[23:55] but it would they would call it the day
[23:56] after the sabbath or the first day of
[23:58] the week the day after the sabbath
[24:00] they would make the offering of this
[24:01] first fruits or it'd be the feast of the
[24:03] first fruits
[24:04] so these are all these these spring
[24:06] feasts that we hear about and
[24:08] ruth is coming to bethlehem judah at
[24:11] this time at this time when these feasts
[24:13] are taking place
[24:14] or maybe even having just transpired
[24:16] that's what caught that's the time that
[24:18] ruth shows up now let's just read
[24:20] through leviticus chapter 23 verses 4 to
[24:23] 12
[24:24] and i'd like just to read it so you can
[24:26] see how the scriptures lay out the
[24:27] timing of these feasts
[24:29] and even the language that's used of it
[24:30] because in his message believers you'll
[24:32] immediately begin to identify
[24:34] that wow there are some types that are
[24:36] in their feast
[24:37] that mean something to us as gentile
[24:40] brain
[24:41] now remember as gentile bride we do not
[24:44] celebrate the feast
[24:45] nor are we bound by the feet the
[24:48] calendar of the feast
[24:49] but they're they represent types to us
[24:51] and sometimes they represent types on
[24:53] varying levels
[24:54] various levels to where we don't just
[24:56] try to make this calendar very very
[24:58] rigid and very very strict where on the
[25:00] day of pentecost
[25:01] uh when it had fully come the holy ghost
[25:03] was poured out and then we try to make
[25:05] all the feast work i mean
[25:07] by strict calendar from that moment on
[25:08] when the church was instituted
[25:10] well what feast was next and when was
[25:11] the trumpets and when were the
[25:12] tabernacles and and all these feasts to
[25:14] try to make them fit as a real
[25:16] rigid structure that god has to stay
[25:18] within for the bride that's not
[25:21] exactly how god deals with the gentiles
[25:23] but that is the calendar that god had
[25:25] given israel
[25:27] and there's types contained in them and
[25:29] that's what brother branham would do
[25:30] is he would identify the type but not do
[25:32] it in such a way that we try to
[25:33] constrain ourselves to certain
[25:35] uh numerics because actually sometimes
[25:37] when we do that we try to restrain
[25:39] ourselves to certain numerics we say oh
[25:40] no it can't be this it can't be this it
[25:42] can't be this
[25:43] because of numerology and you actually
[25:45] find that what you do is you actually
[25:46] cut yourself out of the promise
[25:48] he said no it has to be this it has to
[25:50] be that and god works in different ways
[25:52] and you go by truth and then the
[25:53] numerology lines up with it you don't
[25:55] just start with the number then try to
[25:56] find the truth
[25:57] same thing with the type find the truth
[25:59] then you see the type don't start with
[26:01] the type and try to pigeonhole
[26:02] a truth into it so leviticus chapter 23
[26:05] verses 4 to 12.
[26:07] these are the feasts of the lord this is
[26:09] actually
[26:11] being announced to them and laid out to
[26:13] them here in leviticus even holy
[26:15] convocations
[26:16] which ye shall proclaim in their seasons
[26:21] so there's a time and a place for these
[26:25] feasts in the 14th day of the first
[26:27] month that even
[26:28] is the lord's passover
[26:31] so the 14th day of the first month that
[26:33] even is the lord's passover
[26:35] and on the 15th day of the same month is
[26:37] the feast of unleavened bread unto
[26:39] the lord so you can see one begins on
[26:41] the 14th
[26:42] the other one takes place on the 15th
[26:44] the lord's passover feast of the
[26:45] passover feast of unleavened bread on
[26:47] the next day and then in the first day
[26:49] in seven days you must eat unleavened
[26:52] bread so this begins the feast
[26:55] of unleavened bread in its seven day
[26:56] process in the first day you shall have
[26:59] a holy convocation
[27:00] you shall do no servile work therein
[27:03] but ye shall offer an offering made by
[27:06] fire unto the lord seven days in the
[27:08] seventh day is a holy convocation
[27:09] ye shall do no servile work therein and
[27:12] the lord spake unto moses saying
[27:14] speak unto the children of israel and
[27:16] say unto them so this is
[27:18] uh that that's the feast of passover the
[27:20] feast of unleavened bread
[27:22] he says now and you can see that the
[27:25] the numbers there that they're lining up
[27:26] on the 14th and 15th and then kicking
[27:28] off those seven days
[27:31] and verse 10 speak unto the children of
[27:32] israel and send to them when you become
[27:34] into the land which i give unto you
[27:35] and shall reap the harvest thereof so
[27:38] this would have been a future feast
[27:39] since they weren't planting crops and
[27:40] harvesting
[27:41] there in the wilderness now he's
[27:43] instituting this feast that will come
[27:44] when they're placed in their promised
[27:46] land you shall reap the harvest thereof
[27:48] then you shall bring a sheaf of the
[27:50] first fruits of your harvest
[27:51] unto the priest and he shall wave the
[27:54] sheaf before the lord to be accepted for
[27:56] you on the morrow after the sabbath the
[27:59] priest shall waive it
[28:00] so you have the friday feast of passover
[28:03] or the 14th
[28:04] feast of passover 15th which would have
[28:06] been a shabbat or the sabbath
[28:08] that saturday they'd had the feast of
[28:09] unleavened bread and then tomorrow
[28:11] after the first day of the week or what
[28:12] we would call sunday
[28:14] they are to take a take the reap of the
[28:17] harvest and shall bring gnosis the sheaf
[28:19] of the first fruits of your harvest unto
[28:22] the priest and he shall
[28:23] wave the sheaf before the lord to be
[28:25] accepted by you so this is the wave
[28:27] sheath taking place
[28:28] on that sunday or on that day on the
[28:30] morrow after it says here
[28:32] on the morrow after the sabbath the
[28:33] priest shall wave it and ye shall offer
[28:35] that day when you wave the sheaf a he
[28:37] lamb without blemish of the first year
[28:40] for a burnt offering unto the lord
[28:42] and notice just how beautiful those
[28:44] symbolisms would be
[28:45] on the day that there's actually going
[28:47] to be a wave sheath of the first fruits
[28:49] of this harvest
[28:50] they're actually going to sacrifice an
[28:52] innocent lamb without blemish
[28:54] as a burnt offering and then you see
[28:56] these symbolisms that do what they
[28:58] represent
[28:58] jesus christ because you are you're
[29:02] bible students you're christians you
[29:03] you could you catch these things and
[29:05] probably already been thinking about
[29:06] them as we
[29:07] leaned into this in christ's first
[29:09] coming
[29:11] his death and resurrection unfold
[29:14] around these feasts could what what
[29:17] feast were they keeping
[29:18] in the night that he dipped the sop and
[29:20] they gathered together and they had
[29:21] their feast it was the feast of the
[29:23] passover
[29:24] and it was during that time that they're
[29:25] having this feast and there's
[29:27] uh there's a lot more details to it and
[29:29] how
[29:30] trans begin in the evening and continue
[29:31] all the way on to another evening and
[29:33] we're not going to get into the details
[29:35] of that
[29:35] at least i'm resisting the urge to do so
[29:38] uh but i want to just kind of focus on
[29:40] the fact that we realize in the
[29:42] scripture
[29:43] that these these events in the
[29:45] crucifixion of jesus and his
[29:46] resurrection
[29:47] are taken around this happening during
[29:49] this time period
[29:52] and so these things transpiring during
[29:54] this time period we see christ
[29:56] participating in the feast of the
[29:57] passover we see that he is crucified
[30:00] and he is buried and then they would
[30:02] have been having the feast of unleavened
[30:04] bread
[30:04] and then on that sunday catch this on
[30:07] that day
[30:08] after the morrow on that first day of
[30:10] the week for them which would have been
[30:12] sunday which we call that what
[30:14] resurrection day on that day that he's
[30:17] resurrected at the very time
[30:20] that they are going to be doing this
[30:21] wave of the first fruits
[30:23] christ resurrects from the grave on the
[30:26] first day of the week
[30:27] and he's resurrected on the very day
[30:30] that they're offering the first fruits
[30:33] in the harvest and that's why paul
[30:36] writes in first corinthians 15 20
[30:38] but now is christ risen from the dead
[30:40] and notice the language he uses
[30:42] and become the first fruits of them that
[30:44] slept
[30:45] the first fruits of them that were
[30:47] planted in death now christ
[30:49] is raised and not just on any day he's
[30:51] raised on the day of the feast of the
[30:53] first fruits
[30:54] and they're there doing this offering
[30:56] and this waving of the first fruits
[30:58] there in the temple
[30:59] and the priests are offering this this
[31:01] this wave offering while they sacrifice
[31:03] this lamb
[31:04] and so here christ paul recognizes that
[31:06] christ comes
[31:07] fulfilling that type and christ is the
[31:10] first fruits he's using a phrase that's
[31:12] connected
[31:13] with the old testament feast christ is
[31:16] the first fruits of the resurrection
[31:18] the firstborn among many brethren he's
[31:20] the proof he's the evidence
[31:22] that of eternal life he's the he is
[31:24] actually now
[31:25] fulfilling these great types and these
[31:27] feasts and so this is how
[31:29] christ's ministry is cl is kept
[31:33] in the climax of his ministry and then
[31:35] it would have been seven sabbaths or 50
[31:37] days from that time that you have what
[31:39] the feast of pentecost
[31:40] and when the day of pentecost has fully
[31:42] come then the holy spirit is poured out
[31:43] in the church's birth and you can see
[31:45] all these different things
[31:46] that begin to line up at this time and
[31:48] so this is christ
[31:50] climax and capstone of his ministry it
[31:52] happened in the feast of the passover
[31:54] the feast of unleavened bread
[31:55] his resurrection on the time of the
[31:58] feast of the firstfruits
[31:59] and that would have been at the
[32:00] beginning of the barley harvest
[32:03] and so it's no coincidence that ruth
[32:06] would come to bethlehem judah at this
[32:09] very time
[32:11] and at this very place that she would
[32:13] come to bethlehem the very place that
[32:15] this bread of life was to be born
[32:17] the very place where this lamb without
[32:19] slaughter blemish was born and would
[32:20] be born a baby born to die to be offered
[32:23] as a sacrifice
[32:24] she comes to the place of his birth at
[32:26] the very time
[32:28] in the very season in the uh that he was
[32:31] uh walking through that
[32:33] place of dying out for whose sake our
[32:35] sake
[32:36] for the bride's sake so it's no
[32:37] coincidence she comes on the scene at
[32:39] that time
[32:40] into that place brother branham in the
[32:43] message god's only provided place of
[32:45] worship
[32:47] there was a very lengthy statement i was
[32:49] looking at to read but then i thought
[32:50] well i'd like to read a little bit more
[32:52] from the message it is the rising of the
[32:54] sun so i've tapered this
[32:56] this reading down a little bit and he's
[32:59] making the connection of the seven days
[33:02] of of eating no leaven or having
[33:04] unleavened bread for seven days and kind
[33:06] of making it the connection to the seven
[33:07] church ages
[33:10] and the climax that transpires in at the
[33:12] end of those seven church ages so he's
[33:13] talking about seven days and he's
[33:14] reading from
[33:15] the exodus the seven days seven days
[33:17] with no eleven and he's making the
[33:18] connection back to
[33:20] with the church ages and he makes this
[33:22] statement as he reads in the scripture
[33:24] and there shall be no leavened bread
[33:25] seen in thee in all thy coast
[33:27] seven days and he says the sacrifice
[33:30] here is a type
[33:31] the bride coming forth from the
[33:33] sacrifice which is christ
[33:36] so what's what what's being represented
[33:39] at the time of the feast of passover and
[33:40] the feast of unleavened bread and the
[33:41] feast of the first fruits
[33:43] is not just christ fulfilling
[33:47] th this great work in this first pla you
[33:49] know just dying as a sacrifice
[33:51] but he's doing it as the first step and
[33:53] the first stage of redemption
[33:56] and that your your sins are atoned for
[33:58] in that and it represents you and you're
[34:00] in there and so he makes the connection
[34:02] the sacrifice is a type
[34:04] and he said uses the phrase the bride
[34:06] coming forth
[34:07] so because of the sacrifice the bride
[34:10] comes forth and then he continues in the
[34:11] scripture neither shall there be
[34:12] anything of it the flesh
[34:14] which thou sacrificed the first day at
[34:16] even so the bride coming forth from the
[34:18] sacrifice which is christ
[34:19] he says and remember how we just went
[34:21] through the church ages
[34:22] the messenger to the church always comes
[34:24] just at the dying of the
[34:26] other church age always this is a very
[34:30] important phrase the dying of pentecost
[34:33] brings forth the rapturing of the bride
[34:36] now the dying of pentecost refers
[34:38] specifically to the laodicean church age
[34:40] which brother ben called the pentecostal
[34:42] age
[34:43] and it's representative that that move
[34:45] that organized genuine move of god that
[34:47] that begins at the beginning of the
[34:48] laodicean church age
[34:50] that organizes and what they die out so
[34:52] it's within the laodicean church age
[34:54] that you have this last
[34:55] order of the reformation that they fall
[34:57] away from very quickly 10 to 15 years
[35:00] they've all
[35:00] already fallen away from it and they've
[35:01] organized and that's why there had to
[35:03] come a prophet who would bring a
[35:05] restoration
[35:06] of even that pentecostal move that had
[35:08] been lost so when brother brahm says the
[35:10] dying of pentecost brings forth the
[35:12] rapturing bride
[35:13] that is not a death of the pentecostal
[35:16] experience
[35:17] which the pentecostal experience is to
[35:19] be born again by the baptism of the holy
[35:21] ghost
[35:21] it's not a death of a promise that was
[35:23] given to the church but it relates
[35:25] specifically to this dispensation
[35:27] and the nominal church the pentecostal
[35:30] age the laodicean church age that
[35:31] descends in absolute chaos and complete
[35:33] darkness
[35:34] but as that dies out what does it bring
[35:37] forth
[35:37] the rapturing of the bride so as the
[35:40] laodicean age descends in the chaos and
[35:42] as they go down into darkness and
[35:43] blackness and god draws it out to
[35:45] there's absolutely
[35:46] no light it's a complete blackout of the
[35:49] church
[35:50] and it's really really dark at the very
[35:52] time that that's happened and there's
[35:53] gross darkness of the people
[35:55] that he raises up something and there's
[35:57] a man here who can turn on the light
[35:59] and it brings forth what a rapturing
[36:01] bride
[36:02] a bride comes forth she comes on the
[36:05] scene in the last day she's the one that
[36:07] begins to rise up
[36:08] the diner luther brought forth wesley
[36:10] the dying of wesley brought forth
[36:12] pentecost
[36:12] the dying of pentecost brings forth the
[36:14] message now
[36:16] as that dies a message comes forth what
[36:18] is the shout it's the message
[36:20] it's a messenger it's the living bread
[36:22] of life a shout
[36:23] bringing forth the bride the dying of
[36:26] pentecost brings forth the message now
[36:28] here it's right here patterned all
[36:30] through the scripture there's not a
[36:32] scripture in the bible but what hooks
[36:33] write one with the other
[36:35] all these types and we see the type in
[36:38] the book of ruth at the end of chapter 1
[36:40] ruth comes to bethlehem judah at the
[36:42] beginning of the barley harvest why it's
[36:45] harvest time
[36:47] there's something that's transpiring
[36:48] this time it's christ many years later
[36:50] who it would come from
[36:52] her very lineage boaz and
[36:56] obed and jesse and and david and the
[36:59] very lineage christ the messiah comes
[37:01] and then he is going to be fulfilling
[37:04] all these tremendous types
[37:05] that ruth just steps right into the
[37:07] drama that foreshadows it
[37:10] here's the bride in type a gentile woman
[37:13] stepping into bethlehem judah at the
[37:16] harvest time
[37:17] and laid many many years later christ is
[37:20] going to be born in bethlehem what is it
[37:22] representing
[37:23] it's foreshadowing that christ the word
[37:26] brings forth the bride
[37:29] abraham uses very same language and it
[37:31] is the rising of the sun
[37:34] i know this is a very lengthy uh
[37:37] statement that we're reading to you
[37:39] and if it helps you just to persevere
[37:42] through it
[37:43] i'm i think i'm really going to finish
[37:45] super early tonight
[37:47] and uh i'm just maybe saying that as a
[37:49] positive confession
[37:52] and it is the rising of this if i go
[37:55] longer than what i'm thinking i think
[37:56] it's super early i guess it's kind of
[37:57] ambiguous i'll just blame it all on you
[37:58] you just pull too good
[38:01] he says it was the first corn of god's
[38:03] wheat that had been raised from the dead
[38:05] god's first corn of wheat how about
[38:07] christ
[38:08] by god's quickening power god had
[38:11] quickened his life
[38:12] raised him up from the dead and he was
[38:14] the first fruits of those that slept the
[38:17] first fruit
[38:18] he was that sheaf what did we find in
[38:20] leviticus chapter 23
[38:22] that there is a wave sheep which is the
[38:25] first fruits now there's a subsequent
[38:26] wave of offering that takes place again
[38:28] and you can see the types of that how 50
[38:31] days later there was another loaves two
[38:33] loaves that are waved over the people
[38:35] and these things are done again so
[38:36] there's going to be another wave sheath
[38:38] so if you look at christ as being the
[38:40] first fruits in leviticus 23
[38:42] as the one who is waved as the first
[38:45] fruits there's still
[38:46] another wave that comes and he says
[38:48] that's why they had to wave that sheath
[38:50] for it was the first one that come to
[38:51] maturity
[38:52] and it was waved as a memorial
[38:54] thanksgiving to god believing that the
[38:56] rest of them would come
[38:57] it was a sign and today because he was
[39:00] the first son of god to come to full
[39:02] maturity to be in god
[39:04] he was plucked up from the earth and is
[39:06] waved over the people oh what a glorious
[39:08] lesson
[39:09] by the quickening power the first one
[39:12] although he had been typed and many
[39:14] times as we'll see later that he was
[39:15] type
[39:16] but this was really the first fruit of
[39:18] them that slept
[39:20] he was waived over the promised seed
[39:22] that had
[39:23] promise of life he was waived at the day
[39:26] of pentecost
[39:29] he says when there would come a sound
[39:31] from heaven like a waving
[39:32] mighty rushing wind and was waved over
[39:35] the people the pentecostal people is up
[39:36] at pentecost
[39:37] waiting for the blessing to come so this
[39:40] is him identifying how that
[39:42] christ even on the first the the feast
[39:44] of the first fruits there was a wave
[39:45] offering
[39:46] 50 days later there was another offering
[39:48] that would have been made on the feast
[39:49] of pentecost
[39:50] two loaves waived by the priest and so
[39:52] you can see how brother branham is even
[39:53] saying
[39:54] even on the day of pentecost we could
[39:55] see this type of the wave sheath
[39:58] over the people christ is waved he's the
[40:01] for god's first corn of wheat the first
[40:03] fruits of them that's left
[40:05] slept he was waived at the day of
[40:07] pentecost so who is the wave sheath
[40:09] christ he's the wave sheep and then he
[40:13] says
[40:14] catch this and to be waved again we
[40:16] realize in the last day according to
[40:18] luke 17 30.
[40:20] now this is a prophet showing us again
[40:23] not that we try to stick to this real
[40:24] rigid counter say oh okay well then if
[40:26] he was waved again on pentecost
[40:27] let's try to make all the dates fit
[40:29] again so what's what's seven sabbaths
[40:31] seven church ages since the day of
[40:32] pentecost what feast are we in you're
[40:33] gonna find you're in the middle of
[40:34] nowhere
[40:36] and well this doesn't fit where does
[40:38] this work i don't know what's going on
[40:39] here
[40:39] no i mean don't try to just you don't
[40:41] take the type that oh we're in the
[40:43] exodus and we cross the red sea and so
[40:45] once we've crossed the red sea
[40:47] uh here we are and then once we cross
[40:48] the jordan river here and you try to
[40:50] just
[40:50] take the story of the axis and type it
[40:52] all the way out until you get the end of
[40:54] the book of malachi
[40:55] you're not going to fight you're not
[40:56] going to be able to follow that all the
[40:57] way through so you take the you
[40:59] see the truth and you see these types
[41:00] that sometimes multiple ways that they
[41:02] can apply
[41:04] so now we realize it's going to be waved
[41:06] again according to luke 17
[41:08] 30. we've been looking at this very
[41:09] scripture through several of these
[41:10] services
[41:11] because how the parallel of the days of
[41:14] lot
[41:15] and the day when the son of man is
[41:17] revealed and he reveals himself to
[41:18] abraham and his group and there's sarah
[41:21] which represents the bride and all these
[41:23] promises given to sarah and all these
[41:25] types of
[41:25] lot and his two daughters and their
[41:27] connection to moab which was
[41:29] came from lot with one of his daughters
[41:31] and how you see ruth the moabitus
[41:34] and what's going to change her from
[41:36] being a moabite it's going to be
[41:37] boaz it's going to be the kinsmen
[41:40] redeemer it's going to be this christ
[41:42] figure it's going to be the messiah so
[41:44] there's going to be another wave sheep
[41:46] according to luke 17
[41:48] 30 it is the revealing of the son of man
[41:50] that brings forth the bride
[41:53] this connection of the feast days to
[41:55] this and the very time that ruth is
[41:57] coming to bethlehem judah and now
[41:59] brother brown connects luke 17 32 it
[42:01] says in the
[42:02] day the son of man he says again in the
[42:05] day that the s-o-n of man will be
[42:07] revealed
[42:08] or waived again over the people
[42:11] so it's not a son of man that's waved
[42:13] it's christ the word he's waved over the
[42:16] people
[42:16] now who is the son of man in the
[42:18] beginning was the word and the word was
[42:20] with god and the word was god
[42:22] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[42:24] among us and if all the teaching that we
[42:26] have and confirmation of the word of god
[42:28] by
[42:29] word of god buy signs by wonders we see
[42:32] today
[42:32] that in the book of luke the 17th
[42:34] chapter the 30th verse
[42:36] and malachi 4 and the different
[42:38] scriptures that we are acquainted with
[42:40] that
[42:42] that word again is waived over the
[42:44] people
[42:46] this is what's happening at the very
[42:48] time that ruth comes to bethlehem judah
[42:52] that the feast of leviticus 23
[42:55] the feast of passover the feast of
[42:57] unleavened bread the feast of the first
[42:59] fruits where there's a wave offering
[43:00] over the people
[43:01] these are the things that are
[43:02] transpiring in the time that ruth comes
[43:05] to bethlehem judah and so it's no
[43:07] coincidence that she does that because
[43:08] when brother brown's identified the
[43:10] bride coming on the scenes in the last
[43:12] days he said there's another wave chief
[43:15] there's a wave chief the word again is
[43:17] waved over the people
[43:18] that the dead traditions of man is dead
[43:21] just like ruth's first husband was and
[43:24] the son of god is alive again with the
[43:26] baptism of the holy spirit right among
[43:28] us
[43:29] and is this phrase is important giving
[43:32] us
[43:32] life so the revelation of the son of man
[43:35] is life-giving it's what quickens the
[43:38] bride quickening power snatches us from
[43:40] death to life
[43:41] as christ was the first one to raise
[43:43] from all the prophets and so forth
[43:44] although typed in many places
[43:46] he was the first fruits
[43:50] of those that slept you familiar with
[43:53] this phrase
[43:54] in the bride coming of christ
[43:57] coming out of the church there'll have
[43:59] to be a sheaf wave again in the last
[44:01] days
[44:02] regardless of where you want to put the
[44:04] comma here it's all saying the same
[44:06] thing
[44:07] in the bride coming of christ the coming
[44:09] of christ unto the bride
[44:10] or the bride coming of christ however
[44:13] you look at it it's all the same thing
[44:14] in the bride the coming of christ as she
[44:16] comes out of the church
[44:18] as she separates from orpah as she comes
[44:20] into the promised land as she comes into
[44:22] her harvest time
[44:23] as she comes to bethlehem judah there's
[44:25] a wave sheep that's being offered why
[44:27] because it's time for ruth to be married
[44:29] to boaz
[44:30] it's time for the reveal of the son of
[44:32] man it's time for the bride to be united
[44:35] with their head
[44:36] it's time for the marriage so there will
[44:38] be in the bride coming of christ
[44:40] there'll be a sheath waved again in the
[44:42] last days and that
[44:44] brings forth the bride for her union
[44:47] waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf
[44:49] the first one that come to mature
[44:51] the first one that proved it was wheat
[44:52] that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah
[44:55] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[44:57] it was waived over the people
[44:59] and the first time they'll come forth
[45:01] for
[45:02] the bride age it's a phrase he doesn't
[45:05] use very often but he uses it i think
[45:07] eight times just in the last few months
[45:08] of his ministry
[45:09] for the bright age for a resurrection
[45:11] out of dark denominationalism
[45:14] there's got to be a resurrection she
[45:17] comes to the
[45:18] uh to bethlehem judah at the time of the
[45:20] barley harvest the feast of the first
[45:22] fruits the sign of a resurrection
[45:23] bypassing death
[45:24] life has come forth this is a harvest
[45:27] this is a tremendous time
[45:28] they'll come forth for the bright age
[45:30] for a resurrection out of dark
[45:32] denominationism
[45:33] will be a message what is the message
[45:35] it's the shout
[45:37] what is the shout it's christ the living
[45:39] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[45:41] that the full maturity of the word has
[45:43] returned back again in its
[45:45] full power and being waved over the
[45:48] people
[45:48] by the same signs and wonders that he
[45:50] did back there
[45:53] that's fantastic that's beautiful
[45:57] this is the time that we're living in
[45:59] these are truths that we desire that god
[46:00] would make alive just by revelation and
[46:02] to fully understand
[46:04] these events are transpiring let's not
[46:06] live in a someday mentality all this is
[46:08] going to happen someday this is going to
[46:09] happen sunday
[46:10] if there's going to be if there's going
[46:12] to be something that happens someday
[46:15] that's going to happen but if you're
[46:18] ever going to make it to someday
[46:20] you got to recognize what god's done in
[46:21] this day and you've got to have a full
[46:23] revelation of this day to make it to
[46:25] someday
[46:25] so if there's some day promise that's
[46:27] coming we still got to recognize the
[46:29] promise for this day
[46:31] because he's got to give us a word for
[46:32] this day to get us to someday
[46:34] and if you want to make it to the
[46:35] millennial day you've got to recognize
[46:37] this day in its message
[46:38] if you want to be there at the meeting
[46:39] in the air you've got to catch the
[46:40] revelation of christ
[46:42] here on earth today if you want to be
[46:45] with him one day when he returns back to
[46:46] earth
[46:47] in a corporal body and sets his feet on
[46:49] earth in that coming of jesus christ
[46:51] which all believers believe in
[46:53] and you want to be a part of that coming
[46:55] then you've got to recognize the reveal
[46:56] of the son of that man
[46:58] in this state that you're living in for
[47:00] all believers in every age who are going
[47:02] to be a part of that great coming back
[47:04] in return of the bride to the earth as
[47:05] christ comes the third time
[47:07] with his bride you have to have caught
[47:09] the word for your day
[47:10] to be a part of that descending
[47:14] and so these things are a part of us
[47:15] recognizing who we
[47:17] are and ruth and this is the grace that
[47:19] we could give to a lot of people ruth
[47:21] had no idea who she was when she showed
[47:22] up that day
[47:24] she showed up at the beginning of the
[47:25] barley harvest and she'd say now naomi i
[47:27] don't know if you recognize this
[47:30] you know kind of poor naomi you know you
[47:33] don't realize this but let me tell you
[47:34] something
[47:35] i'm coming back as a gentile i'm a
[47:37] moabite but i'm coming back
[47:40] on the very time some speculate that she
[47:42] shows up after they are coming back from
[47:44] this wave offering this offering of the
[47:46] first fruits
[47:47] and she's coming back at this very time
[47:48] and everyone sees her
[47:50] after they've just seen this great drama
[47:52] portrayed the sacrifice of a lamb
[47:54] the waving of the first fruits and all
[47:56] sudden a gentile woman shows up that's
[47:58] going to marry boaz
[48:01] and comes on the scene right up because
[48:03] there's no way you ever get to a gentile
[48:05] bride unless the lamb is slain
[48:06] and he's resurrected and he sends his
[48:08] spirit back and ruth is showing up right
[48:10] at that very time
[48:11] and ruth just said i don't know if you
[48:12] caught this if you're spiritual you'll
[48:15] cop this
[48:15] i'm a gentile there's going to be a
[48:17] messiah
[48:18] who's going to have all these gentile
[48:20] women in her lineage i'm going to be one
[48:21] of them
[48:22] and i'm going to marry a man who's going
[48:23] to be in that line and i'm going to be
[48:25] part of this great
[48:27] the messiah that's going to come forth
[48:28] and he's going to be sacrificed at the
[48:30] time of the feast of the passover and
[48:31] the feast of unleavened bread he's going
[48:32] to be resurrected on this very time the
[48:35] feast of the first fruits
[48:36] and they're all coming back and they're
[48:38] like whoa what's going on
[48:39] and hey here i am where's my bow as
[48:44] maybe she wouldn't have known it was a
[48:45] boaz but she was she was looking for her
[48:47] bridegroom
[48:48] i'm going to i want to get married
[48:49] because i know this has got to happen
[48:50] she didn't know
[48:52] i i neither did we really right
[48:56] we let me just think about how much
[48:58] we've enjoyed in the message of the hour
[49:01] how much has been revealed to us think
[49:02] back of all the uh
[49:04] let me just maybe by show of hand how
[49:06] many of you have been
[49:07] feeding on this word of god for more
[49:09] than 30 years show your hands it's okay
[49:11] look at this more than a dozen of you
[49:14] jack you're not quite 30 yet
[49:16] been feeding on this word of god for
[49:18] over 30 years
[49:19] and when you begin to feed on it you
[49:21] loved it
[49:22] it was life to you you rejoiced in it
[49:26] and it was unfolding and it's led you
[49:28] and guide you then you're here today
[49:30] go i had no idea at the time
[49:33] really how beautiful and full it would
[49:35] be today and it's
[49:36] unfolded for you and it's grown and it's
[49:39] gotten deeper and richer
[49:41] and there's a point at which many of us
[49:42] realize wait a minute whoa
[49:44] this is what this is it's more than
[49:47] god's sin of prophet it's more than one
[49:49] day there's going to be this and one day
[49:50] there's going to be that
[49:51] this is the fulfilling of the word of
[49:53] god in the last days
[49:54] he made a promise that he would do this
[49:56] he made a promise he would reveal
[49:58] himself
[49:58] and this is it this is the time the
[50:00] rapture's on and i'm living in that time
[50:02] i'm living in that season
[50:05] oh and ruth didn't know it that day and
[50:07] maybe we don't fully understand it
[50:09] but what my prayer is oh god help us to
[50:11] see help us to recognize
[50:13] help us to walk in every step in every
[50:15] face help us to trust
[50:17] maybe even more that ruth did that no
[50:19] matter what
[50:20] circumstances no matter how much loss
[50:22] we've suffered
[50:23] no matter how much pain we're feeling
[50:25] there is a field to boaz
[50:27] there is a provision there is a ministry
[50:30] there are keepers
[50:31] and there is a lord of the harvest that
[50:33] will see you through to the end
[50:37] that he will care for you he will
[50:38] provide for you he'll give you all the
[50:40] things that you have need of
[50:42] even if we can't recognize where we fit
[50:44] in that maybe we could just say at this
[50:46] very moment if we could have talked to
[50:47] ruth
[50:48] we knew what was happening and why naomi
[50:51] was over there going oh
[50:52] call me maura call me maura we could
[50:54] come by and we would just we can't give
[50:56] the story away but just say something
[50:57] say
[50:58] roof i know it may seem really really
[51:00] unlikely
[51:02] you know maybe you don't feel like much
[51:04] but it doesn't matter that you're a
[51:05] moabite
[51:06] there's a promise for you just stay
[51:09] faithful
[51:10] there's a promise for you don't worry
[51:11] you don't fret there's a promise
[51:14] we could do that we might be all excited
[51:16] and try to tell the whole story
[51:18] you're not going to believe this but
[51:18] you're going to go out you're going to
[51:19] start gleaning you want to tell the
[51:20] whole story
[51:21] but you can just be encouraged today
[51:22] god's got your back
[51:24] he's going to take care of you and it's
[51:26] ruth coming on the scene at the
[51:28] beginning of the barley harvest
[51:32] and what was it that we read in the
[51:33] scripture that caused naomi to
[51:36] return it said that she had heard that
[51:39] the lord had visited his people
[51:42] and giving them bread so when she shows
[51:45] up
[51:46] it's the beginning of the barley harvest
[51:48] what could we call that
[51:50] vindication that's vindication that the
[51:54] lord had visited his people
[51:56] and giving them bread if she showed up
[51:58] and there was no barley harvest
[52:00] then your question is i thought i heard
[52:02] that the lord had visited his people and
[52:03] given him bread
[52:05] but she shows up and the very harvest of
[52:08] that barley is the proof
[52:10] that the lord himself had visited
[52:11] bethlehem judah
[52:13] and was giving them bread brother
[52:16] abraham says in the message christ is
[52:17] the mystery of god revealed
[52:19] and brother mike if you could come to
[52:21] the piano we'll close on this statement
[52:24] and christ is the mystery god revealed
[52:27] he said his body was not held in the
[52:29] grave
[52:31] because on that day after tomorrow the
[52:32] day after that sabbath
[52:34] at the very time that they're going to
[52:36] be offering the feast of the first
[52:37] fruits
[52:39] he ra he rose in that resurrection
[52:42] his body was not held in the grave
[52:45] recognized with
[52:46] him in the resurrection same as he has
[52:48] now listened which means this so now we
[52:50] are
[52:50] recognized in the resurrection right
[52:52] that's kind of the language he's using
[52:54] here and i know
[52:54] maybe the way i cut it off it may seem a
[52:56] little clunky
[52:58] but now we are recognized with him in
[53:00] the resurrection
[53:01] we are the same as he is now and he says
[53:03] which means this his word
[53:05] which he is has begun to be risen
[53:10] the word which he is has begun to be
[53:13] risen and what does he say in this
[53:14] message
[53:15] she is risen
[53:19] so the word which he is is a she
[53:22] and she has begun to be risen why
[53:24] because she's to come on the scenes in
[53:26] the last
[53:26] scene in the last day the living bread
[53:28] of life giving rise to
[53:30] the bride he says the word that came
[53:33] down through the age of luther wesley
[53:35] see
[53:36] has began to raise up to its power
[53:39] there it begin to move the move is on
[53:42] for the bride
[53:43] that's thus saith the lord then it moved
[53:46] a little more and now it's coming up to
[53:48] identification i remember how we read a
[53:51] moment ago how we said that the life
[53:53] it's proof that the life is coming in
[53:55] and giving life
[53:56] uh to the body and this like trying to
[53:58] find just exactly how he says it
[54:00] he says it's coming giving life this and
[54:03] it is giving
[54:04] us life is the phrase he says it's
[54:06] coming up to the identification
[54:08] now to the life in the body
[54:12] now that life is coming to the body
[54:14] through the head he says it's a
[54:15] vindication
[54:17] is a vindication of the rapture is at
[54:19] hand
[54:21] it's vindication that the lord has
[54:24] visited his people
[54:25] and giving them bread it's harvest time
[54:29] christ is a mystery god revealed what
[54:30] he's teaching this sermon is
[54:32] it is rapture time when you see the
[54:36] capstone uniting with
[54:38] the body he's declaring that now is the
[54:41] time of the harvest
[54:42] now is the rapture time now that you see
[54:44] the headstone revealing himself
[54:46] now that you see the capstone coming to
[54:48] the body it's the vindication the
[54:50] headship of the church
[54:51] is the vindication that the rapture is
[54:53] at hand
[54:55] when you see the headship in the body
[54:57] becoming one
[54:58] and the fullness of the measure of his
[55:00] manifestation
[55:02] shows that the body is about to be
[55:03] received to the headship
[55:05] he has begun to give life unto his body
[55:10] the one that he has redeemed
[55:13] this is a heavy statement the
[55:14] mediatorial work is done
[55:17] he's bringing his life to body
[55:20] into vindication for the rapture
[55:24] he's bringing life to his bride
[55:28] the living bread of life the life giver
[55:32] that life messenger the revealing of the
[55:34] son of man
[55:36] quickening power let's see is coming
[55:38] quickening power opened up those seals
[55:40] quickening power snatched us from death
[55:41] to life being made alive what a
[55:43] resurrection this
[55:44] is life coming to the body
[55:48] he's bringing his life to the body in a
[55:50] vindication
[55:51] for the rapture
[55:55] proving that the lord has visited his
[55:57] people
[55:58] and giving them bread vindication
[56:02] now let me just say this i i want to
[56:03] just throw this disclaimer in there
[56:05] a lot of people can take this phrase the
[56:07] mediatorial work is done
[56:09] and try to slam this period down and
[56:11] says oh that means there's no mercy then
[56:13] if that's so we're playing church
[56:16] we're just we're in the tribulation time
[56:18] just pretending
[56:21] but there's a lot of people who've taken
[56:23] these things and made them into
[56:24] something they're not so don't
[56:26] don't make the same mistake
[56:29] but he's identifying a special
[56:30] dispensation
[56:34] fullness life
[56:37] headship body vindication
[56:42] for the rapture
[56:45] and that's just pointing
[56:50] to the deep waters not even skimming the
[56:53] surface
[56:54] not even scratching the surface that's
[56:56] just saying this is what's meant
[56:59] this is what's underneath the phrase
[57:02] that roof came to bethlehem judah at the
[57:05] beginning of the barley harvest
[57:07] i know we're a lot further in the
[57:08] journey of ruth ourselves personally
[57:10] even as a
[57:11] as believers today the revelation you
[57:13] have of this message is much further
[57:15] than what it would have been
[57:16] for ruth even if she arrived on the
[57:18] morrow after the feast of unleavened
[57:20] bread
[57:20] and she's there in bethlehem jude at the
[57:22] time of the feast of the first fruits
[57:24] we've advanced further than
[57:27] maybe this specific instance in ruth's
[57:29] life wouldn't it
[57:30] beautiful just to revisit the things
[57:33] that god's done for you
[57:35] to see yourself in the book of ruth we
[57:38] are at harvest time church
[57:40] so our minds are on the rapture
[57:43] that's our goal let's stand tonight
[57:45] together
[57:48] [Music]
[57:52] oh how beautiful it is to serve him
[57:57] in the rapture time rapture season what
[58:00] excitement anticipation it can begin to
[58:02] build for us to think
[58:04] that there's a a promise that we're
[58:07] living under now that speaks of
[58:08] translation
[58:10] that speaks of change that we have
[58:13] received power to bind
[58:15] death that's the power that's present
[58:17] that's resonant within us now that's
[58:18] that's the direction that we're headed
[58:20] then i can believe for all things you
[58:23] you can believe for all things tonight
[58:25] our gracious heavenly father thank you
[58:27] for your presence that's been amongst us
[58:28] this evening
[58:30] thank you for the many lord that are
[58:31] here tonight that have gathered together
[58:34] in anticipation of hearing your word
[58:38] and with the desire to participate in
[58:40] worship
[58:42] and lord as we've delivered a very
[58:43] succinct and very narrow thought tonight
[58:46] of
[58:47] the time that ruth came to bethlehem
[58:49] judah and how it was at the beginning of
[58:51] the barley harvest
[58:53] i'm just mentioning lord
[58:56] by way of observation how that it would
[58:59] have been a time of the feast of the
[59:00] passover and the feast of unleavened
[59:02] bread and the
[59:03] feast of the first fruits and then to
[59:06] see how
[59:06] christ is interacting with these very
[59:10] same feasts
[59:11] and bringing forth the actual
[59:15] substance of what those things
[59:17] foreshadowed
[59:19] he's not the type he's the substance of
[59:23] what those things foreshadowed
[59:26] and he comes on the scene he comes to
[59:28] the feast
[59:31] he's sacrificed as a lamb his body is
[59:34] broken and his blood is shed
[59:38] and then he rises on that first day of
[59:41] the week
[59:43] tomorrow after the feast of unleavened
[59:46] bread
[59:47] [Music]
[59:52] it is the first fruits of them that
[59:54] slept
[59:58] and when god raised christ from the dead
[1:00:00] we were raised with him
[1:00:04] and we're identified with that
[1:00:07] lord we're taught that the body follows
[1:00:08] the head
[1:00:11] and we're thankful in this hour that we
[1:00:12] have received
[1:00:14] the headship of the word and lord i know
[1:00:17] that that could sound like some really
[1:00:20] awesome ear tickling message theology
[1:00:23] but lord
[1:00:24] it's not academia it's not history
[1:00:28] it's not types and shadows it's a
[1:00:30] revelation that gives us bread that we
[1:00:32] need for monday mornings
[1:00:34] it's a revelation that gives us strength
[1:00:36] we need for thursday evenings
[1:00:39] lord it's a revelation that helps us to
[1:00:40] be the men that we ought to be the
[1:00:42] ladies that we are
[1:00:43] the husbands and wives that we desire to
[1:00:45] be the mentors and the leaders and
[1:00:47] uh the parents to our children and the
[1:00:50] brother and sister
[1:00:51] that we ought to be to one another the
[1:00:53] the man of integrity that we ought to be
[1:00:55] within our community
[1:00:56] the the one that's a a a benefit to
[1:01:00] society lord these things are so much
[1:01:02] beyond
[1:01:03] head knowledge and theology lord it's
[1:01:05] real doctrine for the soul
[1:01:08] to make us the overcomers that we so
[1:01:10] crave to be
[1:01:12] lord it's my desire that as we see
[1:01:14] ourselves in the book of ruth it would
[1:01:15] help us to see you and what you are to
[1:01:17] us in this story
[1:01:19] so it brings us real close to you bless
[1:01:22] us tonight
[1:01:23] lord we pray for sister esther that
[1:01:24] you'd bring her a complete
[1:01:26] total deliverance for brother ryan may
