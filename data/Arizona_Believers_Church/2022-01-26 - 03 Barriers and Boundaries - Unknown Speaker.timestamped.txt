[0:00] continue on the subject of barriers and
[0:02] boundaries. And again, tonight we're not
[0:04] going to have much time maybe to recap
[0:06] the first couple services, but I think
[0:07] this can stand alone, but I really
[0:09] desired that we could just concentrate
[0:11] for the moments that we do have together
[0:13] this evening uh on this subject matter.
[0:16] Zechariah chapter 2 and verse one,
[0:20] it says, I lifted up my eyes again and
[0:23] looked and behold a man with a measuring
[0:25] line in his hand. Then said I, whether
[0:29] goest thou? And he said unto me, to
[0:30] measure Jerusalem, to see what is the
[0:32] breadth thereof, and what is the length
[0:33] thereof? And behold, the angel that
[0:36] talked with me went forth. And another
[0:37] angel went out to meet him, and said
[0:39] unto him, Run, speak to this young man,
[0:42] saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as
[0:45] towns without walls, for the multitude
[0:48] of men and cattle therein. For I, saith
[0:51] the Lord, will be unto her a wall of
[0:52] fire round, and will be the glory in the
[0:55] midst of her. Wow. Praise the Lord.
[0:58] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:03] [clears throat]
[1:08] I just I'd like to give maybe some uh
[1:10] comments here at the outset just to
[1:12] reset some of the things we've been
[1:13] talking about. Just some maybe some
[1:15] phrases so that we're all on the same
[1:17] page. And we recognize this in the word
[1:20] of God. And I believe brother Brandham
[1:22] does a masterful job in many different
[1:23] instances to express this characteristic
[1:26] of God. But God is a God of boundaries.
[1:29] And what we could say that we're looking
[1:31] at is a God who is a God of boundaries.
[1:34] But yet uh if I could put it this way,
[1:36] it's paradox. I think in my mind, I keep
[1:38] seeing different paradoxes and maybe
[1:40] you'll see it the same way. But we're
[1:42] tapping into God's God's unlimited
[1:44] resources by respecting his boundaries.
[1:47] And so there's something unlimited about
[1:48] God. But yet we can't even begin to
[1:50] grasp him unless we recognize him. How
[1:53] he limits himself. And God, what made
[1:55] God so great is he could humble himself.
[1:57] He can make himself so small. And so
[1:59] that's uh maybe part of what our thesis
[2:02] statement is is God is a God of
[2:03] boundaries. And yet he's a God that's
[2:05] unlimited. And that's probably what
[2:06] we're going to be looking at tonight is
[2:08] this boundless God. and how that if we
[2:11] want to experience this God, if we want
[2:13] to uh uh enjoy all that he has for us,
[2:16] we're going to have to respect his
[2:17] limits. And I think that might again
[2:19] sound to be a little bit odd to say God
[2:20] has a limit, but yet the hopefully this
[2:22] word will kind of set us straight in
[2:24] that. And God is the one who sets
[2:27] boundaries and he respects boundaries.
[2:30] This is the nature of God. It's a
[2:31] characteristic of God. And I want you to
[2:32] be able to recognize that God is one
[2:34] that sets boundaries, but then God is
[2:36] also one that's going to respect
[2:37] boundaries. And it's Satan that sets
[2:40] barriers. Satan sets barriers and he
[2:42] disrespects boundaries. So respecting
[2:46] boundaries is a characteristic of God.
[2:48] Uh disrespecting boundaries is a
[2:50] characteristic of Satan. And so God is
[2:52] one who sets boundaries. But it's the
[2:54] devil who sets barriers. The the devil
[2:57] really doesn't have a say in limits. He
[2:58] doesn't really have a say in terms of
[3:00] how far something can go. He doesn't He
[3:02] can only pervert. He cannot create. So
[3:04] God can establish a boundary. If if the
[3:07] devil sets something up and he's setting
[3:08] up a wall or he sets some bull work up
[3:10] or he's building something, you might as
[3:12] well just call what he's building a
[3:14] barrier because he can't set boundaries.
[3:16] It's not in Satan's character. And on
[3:19] Sunday, we were looking at different
[3:20] instances in the scripture and asking
[3:22] ourselves, is this a boundary or is it a
[3:24] barrier? And we could find that God's
[3:27] boundaries
[3:29] are Satan's barriers. In other words,
[3:31] God sets a boundary by his word. And
[3:33] this is something that becomes a barrier
[3:35] to Satan. It limits Satan's access to
[3:38] you. And we know that there's a hidden
[3:40] life of Christ that you can be so deep
[3:41] in Christ that the devil doesn't know
[3:43] how to get to you. That the devil can't
[3:45] get to you. And so there is something
[3:47] that limits Satan's power. There's
[3:49] something that limits his access to you.
[3:51] And that wouldn't be a cage to you or
[3:53] wouldn't be bondage to you. It would be
[3:55] a protective barrier of God's word.
[3:58] So God's boundaries are protective
[4:00] barriers to the enemy. to you when you
[4:03] look at it. Don't ever look at the word
[4:04] of God as a barrier. Don't ever look at
[4:05] it as a wall or a chain or or something
[4:07] that's holding you in. But God's
[4:10] boundaries are protective barriers to
[4:11] keep us safe, keeping something out. And
[4:14] it's ensuring the right kind of nurture
[4:17] so that we can grow to what he's called
[4:19] us to be. We want to be 100%. Whatever
[4:21] it is God's called us to be, we want to
[4:22] be 100% hundo as we say in my hood. And
[4:26] that's what we want to do. We want to
[4:27] grow to to 100 and we want to express
[4:30] all that God wants us to be. And we're
[4:32] not going to be able to do that except
[4:33] in our place. We're only going to be
[4:35] able to do that where God has called us
[4:36] to be. And so the paradox is that God
[4:40] uses boundaries to express his unlimited
[4:43] power in his boundless love. So God is
[4:46] unlimited. And and we're just going to
[4:48] emphasize that over and over again
[4:50] tonight. God is unlimited, but yet he
[4:52] uses boundaries to express his unlimited
[4:55] power. He's going to use boundaries to
[4:57] express his boundless love. In Job 36:es
[5:01] 22-23
[5:04] he says and Elohu I believe speaking
[5:06] says behold God exaltth by his power who
[5:09] teaches like him who hath enjoined him
[5:12] his way or who can say thou hast wrought
[5:15] iniquity. This is a lesson in which
[5:17] whatever God says is truth whatever he
[5:19] does is just right. This is the nature
[5:22] of God. No one can say you what you have
[5:24] done is iniquity. What you have done is
[5:25] unfair. God is not bound by our sense of
[5:28] fairness.
[5:29] Whatever he does, he has he's just to do
[5:31] it. He's right in all of his ways. And
[5:34] and the what's expressed in verse 22 and
[5:36] in verse 23 kind of amplifying is God
[5:38] exaltth by his power who teacheth like
[5:41] him. God's power in other words is
[5:42] unlimited. He needs no teachers. He
[5:45] cannot be guided. He cannot be
[5:47] prohibited. He cannot be led to do
[5:49] something nor can he be stopped from
[5:50] doing something. This is a verse that's
[5:52] kind of expressing that God is unlimited
[5:55] in his power. No one can stop him. No
[5:57] one can guide him. No one can tell him
[5:59] what to do. Brother Brandham says in one
[6:01] place, if you don't know all things, you
[6:03] have a limited god. So he's talking
[6:05] about his uh power to predestinate, his
[6:06] power to elect, his power for a nation
[6:09] by fornowledge. If you don't know all
[6:10] things, you have a limited god. You've
[6:13] made him finite like you and I. But God
[6:16] is unlimited.
[6:18] God's power, God's knowledge,
[6:20] everything. He's the omnipotent. This is
[6:22] what God is. He is He is omnipotent. He
[6:26] is unlimited. His power, his knowledge,
[6:28] everything. It's all powerful. It's all
[6:30] knowing.
[6:32] A very familiar uh series of sermons
[6:34] that Brother Brandham preached to us.
[6:35] Absolute and absolute, a absolute. Those
[6:37] sermons where brother Bram's preaching
[6:39] about the absolute. Brother Brham says
[6:41] God is the absolute.
[6:43] So the word is the absolute. And we see
[6:45] these expressions and these phrases. But
[6:47] brother Brandham begins these sermons by
[6:50] defining what an absolute is. And he
[6:53] uses Webster's definition. And that
[6:55] definition, I looked it up in the more
[6:57] modern uh Webster's dictionary, and it
[7:00] means completely free from restraint.
[7:02] And there's several different
[7:03] definitions that are given for it, but
[7:04] completely free from restraint. No
[7:07] restriction, no exception, uh no
[7:09] qualification. Say he's the absolute
[7:11] best. That means there's no one like him
[7:14] or he's the that's the absolute best
[7:17] thing I've ever tasted. You're not qual
[7:18] there's no qualification. There's no
[7:20] restriction. There's no no limitations
[7:22] on it. So to be completely free from
[7:24] restraint, God is the absolute. And
[7:27] brother Bam says this in an absolute. He
[7:29] says Webster says it's perfect in itself
[7:31] and speaking of an absolute unlimited in
[7:34] its power primarily an ultimate. See
[7:37] unlimited in its power, perfect in
[7:39] itself. And it really is an ultimate.
[7:41] the word absolute and and I I wanted to
[7:43] use this statement because what he says
[7:44] next and I like to say this and trust
[7:47] that you'll catch these words because
[7:49] I'm not a trained clergyman in how to
[7:51] and the psychological way to bring a
[7:53] fascinating something that would hold
[7:55] the people. The only thing I do I'm so
[7:58] glad that he could say that and be
[7:59] honest. He's not a clergyman who uses
[8:01] psychology to bind us and to hold us. He
[8:03] says, "The only thing I do is try to do
[8:05] the best that I can on account of the
[8:07] friends that Christ has given me, and I
[8:09] want them to see what my thought is
[8:12] about Christ." Isn't that beautiful?
[8:14] These these sermons he preaches on an
[8:16] absolute and what he's speaking here on
[8:19] an absolute. He's defining that is
[8:21] something unlimited in its power. An
[8:22] absolute is something that's not
[8:24] restrained or restricted. There's no
[8:25] qualification. You cannot qualify God
[8:28] the absolute. He says, "I want you to
[8:30] see." Now, I'm kind of paraphrasing. I
[8:32] want them to see what my thought is
[8:34] about Christ.
[8:36] To say that God is the absolute. The
[8:38] word is the absolute. Christ is the
[8:40] absolute. He's trying to convey to us
[8:42] his thoughts about Christ. So, even
[8:45] using this definition that he pulls from
[8:47] Webster to use this phrase perfect in
[8:49] itself, unlimited in its power. He's
[8:51] wanting us to know something about
[8:53] Christ. So, we could Christ who is the
[8:54] word is limitless in his power. It goes
[8:58] beyond all human bounds.
[9:01] There's no there's nothing that we could
[9:03] construct to keep God out as it were. Uh
[9:06] there there's no nothing no framework
[9:07] that we could use to to limit God or to
[9:10] bring him down or to lift him high. He's
[9:12] not restrained by these things. Brother
[9:14] M says regardless of the price, this is
[9:16] kind of just encouraging the believer.
[9:17] Move on. Keep going on with God. Deeper
[9:20] waters, deeper experiences, more love.
[9:23] There's no limit to it. It's unlimited.
[9:26] That's what he's saying about the word
[9:27] you believe him. The experience you've
[9:28] had with Christ, we can look back say
[9:30] this has been a really good 32 years. It
[9:32] gets better.
[9:32] Amen.
[9:33] And if anybody's kind of experiencing
[9:35] some doldrums, it seems like it's kind
[9:36] of planed out and you're and maybe
[9:38] you're just kind of caught where it's
[9:40] not growing right now. Don't fret. Don't
[9:42] worry. It does get better.
[9:44] No matter where you what you've
[9:46] experienced in God, it gets richer. It
[9:47] gets deeper. Deeper experiences more
[9:50] love. There is no limit. It is
[9:52] unlimited.
[9:54] So if we could say that about God just
[9:56] in these few things, Job talking about
[9:58] how God's power is unlimited. No one can
[10:00] guide him, no one can prohibit him.
[10:01] Brother Ram says God is unlimited. And
[10:04] he says God is the absolute perfect in
[10:06] himself unlimited in his power and
[10:09] there's no limit to God to to deeper
[10:12] waters, deeper experiences, more love.
[10:14] It's unlimited. Then I then I want you
[10:17] to think about the term barrier as we've
[10:20] defined them separately. A boundary is
[10:22] something that sets the further extent
[10:24] of something. It's what sets the limits
[10:26] of something. But a barrier is anything
[10:28] that obstructs an entrance. And so let's
[10:32] look at a barrier is anything that
[10:33] obstructs the entrance into God's
[10:35] unlimited word. These things that we're
[10:37] talking about God. God is unlimited. God
[10:39] is boundless. These are the things are
[10:40] God's character. So a barrier would be
[10:43] something that keeps you from deeper
[10:45] waters, deeper experiences, more love
[10:47] because there's no limit to it. That's
[10:49] what a barrier, we're using barrier to
[10:51] kind of phrase anything that obstructs
[10:53] our going forward in or experiencing or
[10:55] even entering into God's unlimited word.
[10:58] A barrier is any any obstacle that
[11:00] hinders or impedes our enjoyment of
[11:03] God's promises. Just taking this phrase
[11:07] a barrier and it's anything that
[11:09] obstructs, it's an obstacle, something
[11:10] that impedes anything that keeps you
[11:12] from entering into or fully enjoying the
[11:15] promises of God. Then we could say the
[11:18] promises of God are the boundaries. Just
[11:20] as God gave Israel these these
[11:22] boundaries that they were to possess.
[11:23] Just as God gave Adam certain boundaries
[11:25] and certain limitations not to limit him
[11:28] but to give him a framework to express
[11:30] himself. Uh God God barriers work
[11:33] against God's boundaries.
[11:37] Now if you could turn look with me at
[11:39] first Kings chapter 8 verse 27.
[11:42] I just want to use this very quickly but
[11:44] kind of pull a thought out of it that so
[11:47] uh I I believe is very astounding
[11:50] and the question is being pondered but
[11:52] will God indeed dwell on the earth who's
[11:54] the building of the temple the desire to
[11:56] build the temple behold the heaven and
[12:00] heaven and heaven of the heavens cannot
[12:02] contain thee isn't that an interesting
[12:04] phrase as it's being expressed it's the
[12:07] heaven of heavens cannot
[12:11] heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot
[12:13] contain thee. And then the question is
[12:14] how much less this house that I have
[12:16] built.
[12:19] Heaven and heaven of heavens cannot
[12:22] measure thee. It cannot hold you in.
[12:24] You're just this limitous limitless god.
[12:26] You fill all time and space. Your
[12:28] expanse is as far as the universe is.
[12:30] And then beyond that, how can it measure
[12:32] you? How can it hold you in? He says,
[12:34] "How much less this house then? I'm
[12:36] building you this house. How is this
[12:38] going to be something that contains
[12:39] you?"
[12:40] And now, as we mentioned on Sunday,
[12:42] boundaries are something that mark
[12:44] jurisdictions.
[12:46] And so, you look at a property line. A
[12:47] boundary is given to mark the end of a
[12:49] property. And so, that would tell um the
[12:52] city or or maybe a trespasser or your
[12:55] neighbor that this is my responsibility.
[12:57] You're not to cross this or you can't
[12:58] grow something or build something. or in
[13:00] a lot of the HOAs or the city
[13:02] governments that we're subject to uh
[13:04] boundaries of what forms the area that
[13:06] they're going to find us if the weeds
[13:07] get over three and a half inches even
[13:09] that half you got to make sure you knock
[13:11] it down. Why? Because you're responsible
[13:13] for it and there's these bound it's a
[13:14] jurisdiction that you have control over
[13:16] it. It identifies city governments and a
[13:19] and the extent of the power and
[13:21] authority for those who are in charge.
[13:22] It it speaks of responsibility.
[13:26] And so this God who fills all time and
[13:28] space, but now Solomon's saying, "I want
[13:30] to build this house. I'm going to build
[13:31] this house, but how is it that it can
[13:33] contain you? How is this? How can this
[13:35] be something that marks your borders or
[13:38] your boundaries?" Brother Bam says, "And
[13:40] how can I overcome?" He says, "As Christ
[13:42] is the rule," and he's quoting from,
[13:43] "Will I revelation 3 will I grant to sit
[13:46] with me in my throne?" As Christ is a
[13:48] ruler, throne ruler at this time of the
[13:51] complete domain of God. So will the
[13:53] church be with him. The bride be with
[13:56] him in his throne in the entire domain.
[13:58] Not on my throne but in my throne. See
[14:01] where his domain reaches. A throne is
[14:04] over a domain. And a domain reaches just
[14:07] as far as its boundary boundaries do.
[14:10] And this is from eternity to eternity.
[14:14] Notice in in first kings it's looking at
[14:16] a god and says the heaven and heaven of
[14:19] heavens cannot contain you. Brother
[14:21] randomly speaking about a dominion and a
[14:24] throne and how we'll reign with him in
[14:26] his throne. Not on the throne but in his
[14:27] throne. He says that's the domain of God
[14:30] and his domain goes as far as his
[14:32] boundaries. And his boundaries are from
[14:34] eternity to eternity. In other words, it
[14:37] doesn't know an end. His kingdom shall
[14:40] know no end. HIS GLORY SHALL KNOW NO
[14:42] BOUNDS. HIS MAJESTY AND POWER IS FOREVER
[14:45] AND EVER. To even think that as God
[14:48] unfolds himself, you could give him an
[14:50] eternity and not all of him has
[14:52] unfolded.
[14:52] Amen.
[14:53] Because this is just the the character
[14:55] of God. But if you catch what the the
[14:58] writer in First Kings is referring to
[15:00] and what Psalm is expressing, how much
[15:03] less this house that I have builded,
[15:05] this boundless God is still willing to
[15:08] be contained within a boundary.
[15:11] He's still willing to identify in a
[15:13] place that he'll put his name in a place
[15:14] that he's going to bury in his presence
[15:17] will dwell. And he even speaks how there
[15:19] between the cherubam will I will I come
[15:21] and dwell and I'll make myself known.
[15:23] This is a God who fills all time and
[15:25] space and the heavens cannot contain.
[15:27] Yet he's willing to come down in an
[15:29] expression so that he can be felt. An
[15:31] expression to a prophet Moses so he can
[15:33] be seen. an expression there behind the
[15:35] badger skins and there in the holiest of
[15:37] holies so that he can be there upon the
[15:39] altar of God and upon the mercy seat to
[15:41] declare his presence in in amongst
[15:44] Israel. This is part of God's desire.
[15:47] Now, if you could again just uh you're
[15:48] doing wonderfully in and concentrating,
[15:51] but focus with me as we look at
[15:53] Zechariah chapter 2:es 1:5. Just be very
[15:57] deliberate in how you process the words
[16:00] that I'm using tonight. And Zechariah
[16:02] chapter 2 1:5 he says, "I lifted up mine
[16:05] eyes again and looked and behold a man
[16:08] with a measuring line in his hand." So
[16:11] he's got his he's got his tape. He's
[16:12] going to go measure. He says, "Then said
[16:14] I, with thou goest thou?" And he said
[16:16] unto me to measure Jerusalem to see what
[16:19] is the breadth thereof and what is the
[16:20] length thereof.
[16:22] This timing of
[16:25] um Zachchariah is a distressing time.
[16:28] You have these fugitives who've been
[16:30] taken out of Jerusalem uh in Babylon and
[16:34] their captives and even those that would
[16:35] be returning would come to see that
[16:37] Jerusalem is far from the glory that it
[16:39] once held. She her walls are torn down.
[16:41] She's a city in ruin. So it's a very
[16:43] distressing time. But this one is going
[16:45] to go forth to measure Jerusalem. And
[16:48] behold, the angel that talked with me
[16:50] went forth, and another angel went out
[16:51] to meet him, and said unto him, now this
[16:54] is to be a word of encouragement to
[16:56] those who are going to see a city in
[16:58] ruins. Ron, speak to this young man,
[17:00] saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as
[17:03] towns without walls. This is an
[17:06] interesting phrase to the people at this
[17:08] time. You would not have a town without
[17:10] a wall. You would not have a Jerusalem
[17:12] without walls. You would not have a city
[17:14] without walls. It was unknown, unheard
[17:16] of in this time that there would
[17:17] actually be walls as it says uh for the
[17:19] multitude of men and cattle therein. Say
[17:21] if you're going to have men, if you're
[17:22] going to have cattle, you need walls.
[17:23] You need barriers. You need things to
[17:24] keep them in. But the scripture saying,
[17:26] "Jerusalem shall be inhabit inhabited as
[17:29] towns without walls for the multitude of
[17:31] men and cattle therein. For I, sayeth
[17:33] the Lord, will be unto her a wall of
[17:36] fire round about, and will be the glory
[17:38] in the midst of her." God gives
[17:40] Zachchariah a vision. And through these
[17:42] words that are spoken, he's given them
[17:44] this vision of a spiritual city without
[17:46] walls. Restoration of Jerusalem to fit
[17:49] these parameters never actually happened
[17:51] literally in the times of Israel and
[17:53] even the times of restoration of the ne
[17:55] under Nehemiah. But yet God is saying
[17:57] Jerusalem shall be inhabited as a town
[17:59] without walls. Think of this in a
[18:01] spiritual sense, something without
[18:03] borders. A city without boundaries
[18:06] speaks of the boundless word of God. To
[18:08] say that Jerusalem will be inhabited as
[18:10] a town without walls, without borders or
[18:12] or without these physical boundaries is
[18:15] talking about the unlimited power of
[18:16] God. Even speaking about the bride,
[18:18] which in a spiritual sense you can't
[18:20] measure. We cannot measure the things
[18:23] that God God is doing in our midst right
[18:25] now. If we tried to measure it, quantify
[18:27] it, qualify it, we'd find ourselves on a
[18:29] fool's errand because man cannot measure
[18:32] quantify or qualify the greatness of
[18:34] God. So, he's talking about a city
[18:36] that's not going to have boundaries.
[18:37] It's speaking about a God which is
[18:38] boundless who has unlimited power and is
[18:41] saying that God is going to be around it
[18:43] but also within it.
[18:46] And to say Jerusalem shall be dwelt in
[18:48] as a town without walls, it's painting a
[18:50] picture of an open city
[18:53] uh capable of endless expansion,
[18:56] a city without need of defenses to keep
[18:59] others out. But in order to contain it
[19:01] all, it must not have any walls.
[19:04] But it says God would be the wall of
[19:06] fire about the inhabitants. So not only
[19:08] is he in a wall about them to protect
[19:11] them, but he's also dwelling, his glory
[19:12] is dwelling in the midst of them, within
[19:15] them.
[19:17] As this one is running forth with a
[19:19] measuring line in his hand to measure
[19:20] Jerusalem to see what the breadth
[19:22] thereof is and the length thereof, it
[19:24] was something that could not be
[19:25] measured, something that could not be
[19:27] limited, something that couldn't be
[19:29] contained. Uh uh but yet it would be
[19:32] something with a boundary.
[19:34] So, on one hand, and I know I'm kind of
[19:36] expressing a paradox, on one hand, it
[19:38] doesn't have any walls. It doesn't seem
[19:40] to have any limits. It speaks of this
[19:41] unlimited God, but yet God says he's
[19:43] going to be a WALL OF FIRE ABOUT HER.
[19:45] YET, IT STILL HAS a boundary.
[19:48] And what I'm wanting to kind of zero in
[19:49] on is this paradox of finding the
[19:52] borderline
[19:53] into an infinite God.
[19:56] A a place where you can enter into where
[19:58] this God is. A place that you can find
[20:00] where he dwells. Even though he he is
[20:03] great and he extends beyond all
[20:04] boundaries or barriers and he's perfect
[20:06] and unlimited in his power and all these
[20:08] things we've been expressing about this
[20:10] BOUNDLESS GOD, THERE'S A WAY THAT we
[20:11] have to find the borderline where God is
[20:14] and find where he dwells and where he
[20:16] manifests himself in order to know him.
[20:21] In Isaiah chapter 61, it says, "Thus
[20:23] sayeth the Lord, the heaven is my throne
[20:26] and the earth is my foottool." In a way,
[20:29] it kind of measures his domain and his
[20:30] kingdom. The earth is my foottool but
[20:33] heaven is my throne. Where is the house
[20:35] that you build unto me and where is the
[20:37] place of my rest? IN OTHER WORDS, HOW
[20:40] CAN GOD be contained?
[20:42] How is it that God could dwell in a
[20:45] house?
[20:47] It it almost in one sense I think the
[20:48] scriptures even go to such lengths even
[20:50] as it's expressed in first kings 8. How
[20:52] is a how is a temple gonna tabernacle
[20:55] God? How is God gonna dwell behind
[20:57] tents? How is he going to make himself
[20:59] known within a physical building? Why
[21:01] would he constrain himself or limit
[21:03] himself? So, how can God be contained?
[21:05] How can he dwell? Uh where's the place
[21:07] of my rest? What kind of what how is he
[21:09] going to build me? But yet, God chooses
[21:11] boundaries to show his glory.
[21:14] He could have chosen the amphitheater of
[21:16] the sky alone to declare himself. He
[21:18] could have just uh let it rest in in in
[21:21] astronomy to try to figure it out or
[21:22] even science and technology to look at
[21:24] the expanse of the universe and to
[21:26] believe that God has created and then
[21:28] see his magnitude and his greatness and
[21:30] his glory. But yet God chooses to
[21:32] confine himself and to dwell into
[21:34] something in order to make himself
[21:36] known.
[21:38] God is the absolute. He's unlimited.
[21:40] He's omnipotent. There's no limit to
[21:42] him. He is it's us that limit him. It's
[21:46] us that limits his power. It's us that
[21:48] limits his presence. It says in
[21:50] Colossians chapter 1 19, for it pleased
[21:53] the father that in him, speaking of
[21:54] Jesus Christ, should dwell should all
[21:57] fullness dwell.
[22:00] This is remarkable
[22:02] that in Jesus Christ there's something
[22:04] that the fullness of God dwelt in him.
[22:08] Colossians 2:9, for in him, speaking
[22:10] again of JESUS CHRIST, DWELLETH ALL THE
[22:12] FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD, in a bodily
[22:14] image, in a corporal image, for in him
[22:16] dwelleth ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE Godhead
[22:19] bodily. Bodily, this body uh uh
[22:22] contained the fullness of the Godhead.
[22:26] And and I I'd like to touch on it in uh
[22:30] in more time. We recognize that Christ,
[22:33] WE'RE TAUGHT THAT JESUS CHRIST HAD God
[22:35] without measure.
[22:37] And we have him by measure.
[22:40] But that doesn't limit God.
[22:44] It's an expression of truth. It's
[22:46] expression of reality. But yet it's not
[22:47] limiting God. But in Christ dwelt all
[22:50] the fullness of the Godhead in a body in
[22:53] the body of Christ. And it pleased the
[22:54] father. His son all the fullness OF GOD
[22:58] WOULD DWELL. SO GOD IS so great. Who the
[23:02] heaven and the heaven of heavens could
[23:05] not contain him. BUT YET THE A BODY HAD
[23:08] BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM to express himself
[23:11] through. And this GOD THAT FILLS ALL
[23:14] TIME AND SPACE, THAT IS ETERNAL, THAT
[23:15] HAS NO BEGINNING AND NO END, would
[23:17] actually choose a SON THAT WAS BORN of a
[23:20] woman that they SAY, "WE COULD GO BACK
[23:22] TO THIS TIME WHEN YOU WERE BORN. WE
[23:23] COULD WE KNOW YOUR FATHER, WE KNOW YOUR
[23:25] MOTHER, WE KNOW YOUR BROTHERS, WE KNOW
[23:26] YOUR SISTERS. THEY'RE ALL STILL YET WITH
[23:28] US. and these we know. BUT YET GOD
[23:30] CHOOSES TO HUMBLE HIMSELF AND CONDESCEND
[23:33] TO DWELL WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A MEEK
[23:35] AND LOWLY. AND LET'S JUST READ IT HOW
[23:37] THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK OF IT. AN UNCUMBLY
[23:40] RE A MAN WHO IS WITHOUT ANY BEAUTY,
[23:44] despised and rejected. God chose to to
[23:48] constrain himself and humble himself
[23:50] within those those terms. And what's the
[23:53] danger of mankind? Are always looking
[23:54] for something great.
[23:56] And in looking for something great, you
[23:58] look right over the top of it.
[24:00] Everyone's looking, oh, that seventh
[24:01] seal. Oh, the third pull. Oh, that these
[24:04] things. IT'S GOING TO BE SO AMAZING. And
[24:07] you're looking right over the top of it
[24:09] because it's in simplicity.
[24:13] Now, with with that as a kind of a
[24:15] building block, I want to take a little
[24:16] bit of a turn here and express this that
[24:21] God is a God of boundaries. And then God
[24:23] chooses to now bind himself or bind to
[24:26] be bound within the framework of Christ.
[24:29] And then we we recognize now he's in his
[24:31] body which is the church. He's in his
[24:33] bride. But in looking at God as having
[24:36] boundaries, a boundary doesn't
[24:38] necessarily mean you cannot ever enter.
[24:41] Are you listening? If there's a
[24:43] boundary, A BOUNDARY ITSELF DOES NOT
[24:45] MEAN YOU can never enter in. If you put
[24:47] up a boundary, that doesn't mean no
[24:48] entrance whatsoever at any time. But a
[24:51] boundary will have an appropriate place
[24:54] of entrance. You put up a wall and what
[24:56] do you put there if you want people to
[24:57] enter? A gate.
[24:59] You build a house. A house has four
[25:01] walls at least. And you'd find that if
[25:02] you want to ever get into that house,
[25:04] you're going to have doors.
[25:06] Right? So, we recognize that when it
[25:08] comes to boundaries, boundaries have
[25:10] entry points. And and that's what this
[25:12] boundary is declaring. You have a wall,
[25:14] but then you have a gate. And it's
[25:15] telling you don't climb over the wall.
[25:18] Don't dig under the wall. Don't tear
[25:20] down the wall. come through the gate.
[25:23] And so THERE'S THIS IS HOW THAT IT
[25:25] WORKS. When you look at a boundary, the
[25:27] boundary itself is not a barrier, but it
[25:29] the boundary if it's to be entered into,
[25:32] it's going to have an appropriate place
[25:33] where you approach it and enter in. For
[25:36] example, when you come to someone's
[25:37] house, IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT IF
[25:39] THEY'RE HOME, YOU DON'T GO PEEKING in
[25:41] windows,
[25:42] right? You could take this to examine
[25:45] your own personal relationships just
[25:46] using this allegory of peeking in
[25:48] windows. You don't you don't go peeking
[25:50] in windows. Well, I wonder if they're
[25:51] home. Well, well, let's just go around
[25:52] the back and peek in the window. No, you
[25:54] knock on the door.
[25:56] You don't just open the door and say,
[25:58] "Hey, is anybody home? Are you here?"
[26:00] YOU RESPECT THAT BOUND, THAT BORDER
[26:02] THAT'S put there. And the door is put
[26:04] there as an appropriate place to gain
[26:06] entrance into this HOUSE THAT IS WALLED
[26:09] AND THIS HOUSE THAT HAS THESE BOUNDARIES
[26:11] BECAUSE THAT'S respecting those
[26:14] parameters that been put in place. THE
[26:15] PRIVACY, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT.
[26:17] I'm wanting you to think how THAT IF GOD
[26:19] HAS A BOUNDARY, he's a God THAT IS
[26:21] ACCESSIBLE, BUT YOU can only access him
[26:24] through his entry points.
[26:26] You're not going to be able to beat on
[26:27] the wall and God's going to say, "Okay,
[26:28] fine. I'll tear down the wall."
[26:30] You're not going to try to run high run
[26:32] fast enough to be able to leap over it.
[26:33] You're not going to dig deep enough to
[26:35] get under it. If you're going to get
[26:36] access and come inside the boundaries
[26:39] and the PROTECTIVE HAVEN OF GOD'S WORD,
[26:40] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND THE PLACE
[26:42] WHERE YOU CAN ENTER IN.
[26:44] And in John chapter 14, I really would
[26:46] like for you to ponder that a little bit
[26:48] more in terms of uh uh these things
[26:50] where you have there's things that we
[26:52] just respect and they're boundaries. I I
[26:55] just feel maybe to make reference to
[26:57] this. Um when when you visit someone's
[27:00] home and you need to wash your hands,
[27:02] you don't ask him, "Where's the master
[27:03] bathroom?" Right?
[27:07] Right.
[27:08] Please tell me you're not all like my
[27:10] brother.
[27:11] that there's just there's just certain
[27:13] THINGS YOU WOULD RESPECT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
[27:14] THAT'S the master bathroom. Where's the
[27:16] guest bathroom? I'd like to use the
[27:17] guest bathroom. And and there's certain
[27:19] things you just don't take the liberty
[27:20] TO DO IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME THAT YOU
[27:22] MIGHT otherwise uh do in your own home.
[27:24] And some people say measure
[27:26] better ponder that before you sell it
[27:28] somebody that oh this is my house. I can
[27:31] do whatever I want. And then they'll
[27:32] just take advantage of it. But we
[27:33] realize that we find ourselves
[27:35] respecting certain things about homes
[27:37] because there's there's parameters.
[27:39] There's frameworks. There's there's a
[27:41] the right way to do something.
[27:44] In John 14:6, Jesus saith unto him, "I
[27:47] am the way, the truth, and the life. No
[27:50] man cometh unto the father but by me."
[27:55] He's speaking of an everpresent God and
[27:58] how you can access him.
[28:00] In other words, this is a God who feels
[28:02] all time and space. THIS IS AN ALL
[28:03] KNOWING GOD. This is an omnipotent God.
[28:05] This is a God that knows our thoughts.
[28:06] This is a God THAT KNOWS JUST HOW MANY
[28:08] time a sparrow is going to flap its
[28:09] wings. He knows how many times you're
[28:10] going to bat the eye. He knows how many
[28:12] apples are in the seed. This is a God
[28:14] that knows everything. And this is a God
[28:16] that's just pervasive in everything. And
[28:18] so you think, well, if God's just there,
[28:20] then I can just reach out and touch him,
[28:22] right? I should just be able to have
[28:24] access to this God at any moment, at any
[28:26] time. But Jesus is saying, I am the way.
[28:29] I am the truth and the life. No man can
[28:32] come to this limitless God. No man can
[28:34] begin to KNOW THIS GOD EXCEPT I REVEAL
[28:37] HIM FIRST. and you know HIM FIRST AND
[28:40] COME TO HIM FIRST by me.
[28:43] He's speaking about access to this
[28:45] boundless God.
[28:47] So God's boundaries as we've elicited
[28:49] God has boundaries and he's within the
[28:51] bounds of his word. He has an interest
[28:53] entrance.
[28:54] You just need to find the appropriate
[28:56] place to enter.
[28:58] That's why just not every church is an
[28:59] entrance into Christ.
[29:02] In John chapter 10 7-10, then said Jesus
[29:05] unto them again, verily, verily, I say
[29:07] unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
[29:11] So God has boundaries and God has walls
[29:13] and God sets parameters. Thank God
[29:15] there's a door. Otherwise, it'd be this
[29:18] walled God, this this bordered off God,
[29:20] THIS CLOSED OFF GOD. I'VE GOT NO WAY TO
[29:23] ACCESS HIM. I GOT NO WAY TO COME TO HIM.
[29:24] I GOT NO DAYSMAN UH THAT can bring me
[29:26] INTO AUDIENCE WITH GOD AND PUT ME IN THE
[29:28] PRESENCE OF THIS GOD AND introduce me
[29:30] and allow us to communicate. BUT CHRIST
[29:32] BECOMES THE ONE WHO IS THE WAY TO THE
[29:34] FATHER. AND HE SAYS, I AM THE DOOR OF
[29:36] THE SHEEP. All that ever came before me
[29:39] are thieves and robbers, but the sheep
[29:40] did not hear them. I am the door. By me,
[29:45] if any man enter in, he shall be saved
[29:48] and shall go in and out and find
[29:50] pasture. It's by Christ. THIS IS THE
[29:51] ONLY PLACE YOU'RE FED. THIS IS THE ONLY
[29:53] place you're led. This is the only place
[29:54] you find the comfort and safety and the
[29:56] rest and the nurture of the shepherd.
[29:58] The thief cometh not but for to steal
[30:00] and to kill and to destroy. That's why
[30:03] you need a shepherd who stands Christ
[30:05] even in this image of a shepherd the
[30:07] door of the sheep. I am come that they
[30:09] the sheep might have life and that they
[30:11] might have it more abundantly.
[30:14] This is Christ then who becomes the
[30:17] entrance into this limitless God.
[30:20] I I realize maybe I'm just taking these
[30:23] um little mini thoughts and building
[30:25] them together and we could amplify that
[30:28] to to a much larger extent. But here's a
[30:31] God then that is without limits. But
[30:34] then God is going to make himself
[30:36] available to us and it's going to be
[30:38] through Jesus Christ. That's the access.
[30:40] That's the door. That's the point of
[30:41] entry. That's the door, the gate into
[30:43] within the boundaries of God.
[30:47] But it's Satan who wants to put up
[30:49] barriers to the entrance into this word.
[30:53] Why? The word keeps Satan out. So if you
[30:56] ever can get in the word, he can't get
[30:58] to you. So what Satan wants to do is
[31:00] just kind of keep us huddled on the
[31:01] outside. He wants to have barriers from
[31:03] you entering into the word. And we are
[31:06] living in a time where all man-made
[31:09] barriers are torn down.
[31:12] If I could put it this way, if there's
[31:13] any man-made barrier holding you back,
[31:16] it it's uh it's a bluff.
[31:20] If there's any man-made uh um uh
[31:24] structure or system or framework that's
[31:27] keeping you from entering into
[31:28] everything in God's word, it's something
[31:30] that God has already made lifeless.
[31:33] It it it's lying to you. any kind of
[31:35] intimidation, any kind of fear, any kind
[31:37] of manipulation, control or abuse that
[31:39] would bind God's people to a personality
[31:41] or to politics or some system. They're
[31:43] all lifeless. They're all blust because
[31:45] God's word has been made fully available
[31:47] to his bride. And the only thing that's
[31:49] keeping you back is NOT TIMING, IS NOT
[31:51] PROPHECY. Because we can look at so many
[31:53] things in God's word and says, "Yes, it
[31:55] was an ONCOMING PROMISE, BUT NOW IT'S
[31:57] HISTORY. NOW IT'S BEEN FULFILLED." If if
[32:00] I could put it this way, the church is
[32:02] no LONGER RESTRAINED BY PROPHECIES
[32:04] WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SEVEN church
[32:06] ages. But we've arrived at a time where
[32:08] EVERY PROMISE THAT GOD HAD TOWARDS HIS
[32:10] BRIDE AND TOWARDS UH THE CHURCH FOR A
[32:13] RAPTURE HAS BEEN POURED OUT UPON HER.
[32:15] AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS BEING
[32:17] WITHHELD FROM US BY GOD. AMEN.
[32:19] AND SO IF SATAN IS THE LI IS SAYING THAT
[32:21] GOD HAS WITHHELD HIMSELF, GOD HAS
[32:23] WITHDRAWN SOMETHING, GOD IS HOLDING
[32:25] SOMETHING FOR AN EIGHTH MESSENGER, GOD
[32:26] IS HOLDING SOMETHING BACK FOR ANOTHER
[32:27] REVIVAL, THOSE ARE ALL LIES OF THE DEVIL
[32:30] BECAUSE GOD HAS POURED OUT ALL THE
[32:32] BLESSINGS AND BENEFITS WE NEED TO
[32:34] TOTALLY OVERCOME Leodysia and actually
[32:36] take a step out of here and do a body
[32:38] change.
[32:39] It's all available to us there. There
[32:41] are no God-given barriers to that. There
[32:44] is no God God-given boundary to that. It
[32:47] says, "Nope, that door's closed. You got
[32:48] to wait for prophecy."
[32:51] When we look at the at the time when the
[32:53] children of Israel gathered into the
[32:54] upper room, excuse me, when the
[32:57] disciples gathered into the upper room
[32:58] and he said, "Go there, tarry there
[33:01] until what?" Till the fullness of time
[33:03] would come, until the day of Pentecost
[33:04] was fully come. What? That was according
[33:07] to a boundary that God HAD SET BY HIS
[33:09] WORD. And the promise would come at that
[33:12] time. They couldn't pray it down
[33:14] beforehand. AND THEY COULDN'T STOP IT IN
[33:17] THAT MOMENT WHEN it came.
[33:19] And so once that came, brother Brandham
[33:21] teaches us that from that moment on,
[33:23] every age is the age of the Holy Ghost
[33:25] to the believer
[33:26] because now the promise had been given
[33:28] because the time came. We're also living
[33:31] in a time when the time has come. There
[33:34] is no more delay. We're not looking at
[33:35] our clocks. Listen, we know that Israel
[33:38] is a time piece. ISRAEL IS A CALENDAR,
[33:40] BUT DON'T BE LOOKING AT HER to signal TO
[33:42] US THAT IT'S TIME TO GET OUT OF HERE.
[33:44] WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE SIGNS. WE'VE
[33:46] ALREADY HEARD THE VOICE. WE KNOW IT'S
[33:48] THE RAPTURE TIME. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE
[33:50] LIVING IN A TIME WHERE WE'VE GOT TO GET
[33:51] OUT OF THE WAY FOR GOD TO DO WHAT HE
[33:52] WANTS TO DO TO ISRAEL.
[33:55] SO, we don't we're not we're not, well,
[33:57] is Israel going to get this done? Is
[33:58] Israel going to get that done? There's a
[33:59] lot of fun things to talk about when it
[34:01] comes to Israel, but our eyes have to be
[34:03] on the word for us.
[34:04] What a beautiful uh uh parallel that
[34:06] brother Brown brings in recognizing your
[34:08] day and its message. And he's talking
[34:09] about Israel and like recognize your day
[34:12] and its message. If these are the things
[34:14] that are going to be turning to the Jews
[34:16] very shortly, then there's got to be
[34:17] something in the word of God for the
[34:19] bride that he's doing to bring Christ to
[34:23] Israel.
[34:25] One of those sermons that has that dual
[34:26] meaning to us is feast of the trumpets.
[34:29] And because the promise of today,
[34:32] listen, we can go beyond all barriers
[34:33] into the boundless word of God. We can
[34:36] go beyond all barriers into the
[34:38] boundaries, the confines of an unlimited
[34:40] God. and feast of the trumpets. He says
[34:43] the church world rejects Christ and he's
[34:45] put on the outside. Remember that image
[34:47] and the same seal when it's opened to
[34:50] show Jesus on the outside of the church
[34:51] trying to get back in. At the same time,
[34:54] the trumpet sounds for the Jews and the
[34:55] Jews recognize the atonement. Says,
[34:57] "Glory, hallelujah, oh my." There's a
[34:58] lot that he's expressing in this season
[35:01] and these events that take place under
[35:03] that seal. He says, "The Holy Spirit,"
[35:05] this is the part I want you to see. the
[35:06] Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[35:09] denominational rivers for almost 2,000
[35:11] years. So, there's actually been
[35:13] something holding him back.
[35:16] And he says, "But is to be loosed in the
[35:18] evening time by the evening time
[35:20] message." We've received a message that
[35:23] has removed whatever was holding him
[35:25] back. Removed whatever prophecies,
[35:27] whatever scripture, whatever man-made
[35:28] barriers, whatever chains, whatever it
[35:30] is has been holding him back. these
[35:31] denominational RIVERS HOLDING BACK
[35:33] CHRIST. HOLDING BACK THE HOLY SPIRIT,
[35:35] THE HOLY SPIRIT BACK in the church
[35:37] again. He's saying the church world
[35:38] rejected Christ. But now the Holy
[35:40] Spirit, Christ himself revealed in human
[35:42] flesh in the evening time.
[35:45] This is this is this is signaling to us
[35:47] that we're coming to the supreme
[35:49] expression, the full expression of Jesus
[35:51] Christ in his bride. as for in Christ
[35:54] dwelt the FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD
[35:55] BODILY. NOW HE'S POURING HIMSELF FULLY
[35:58] INTO HIS BRIDE FOR THAT FINAL RIDE, FOR
[36:00] THAT FINAL MANIFESTATION, FOR THE FINAL
[36:02] EXPRESSION.
[36:04] And this is what we have access to.
[36:07] I I wanted to read that statement so I
[36:09] could say this. There are no prophetic
[36:11] boundaries or no scriptural borders that
[36:14] are holding us back from walking fully
[36:15] in the word of God.
[36:18] We could not exist in 1882 and saying,
[36:21] "Oh my, let's just manifest 108-11. Oh,
[36:24] let's be let's let's rejoice in and and
[36:26] and Malachi 4:5 and 6." There's things
[36:28] that we would have just been playing
[36:30] church.
[36:32] Uh we would have just been assuming we
[36:33] could Jesus would say anything that's
[36:35] been before me has been a thief and a
[36:36] robber. But then once this day, this
[36:38] scriptur is fulfilled, that opens up a
[36:41] whole new land for us to walk into.
[36:45] It opens up a whole new uh uh the the
[36:47] the promised land of the son of man.
[36:49] THAT'S THE BORDERS. THAT'S THE
[36:50] boundaries where all things are
[36:52] possible. That's what we've walked into.
[36:54] It says in Hebrews chapter 6:es 1:3,
[36:57] Paul says, "Let us go on into
[36:58] perfection.
[37:00] Not laying again the foundation, leaving
[37:01] the principles of the doctrine of
[37:03] Christ, not going beyond them. They're
[37:04] the foundational elements, but let us go
[37:07] on to the perfection of the building.
[37:08] Let us go on to the fullness of the
[37:10] structure." And notice what he says in
[37:12] verse 9. And this will we do if God
[37:15] permit.
[37:17] So we could go on unto perfection. What
[37:19] God lets opens up the gate or opens up
[37:23] the door to go into it. All the churches
[37:27] can just gather up and all the believers
[37:29] can gather up and wait there for the
[37:30] entrance into the capstone. But they
[37:32] JUST HAVE TO PILE UP AND PILE UP AND
[37:33] PILE UP. ALL STAND IN LINE UNTIL GOD
[37:35] PERMITS.
[37:36] Something that God allows. What does it
[37:39] mean? that God has a boundary that you
[37:42] can't cross until it's time for it to
[37:44] open up.
[37:46] And the message going beyond the camp
[37:50] says it's when the plane has got so
[37:52] fast, he's talking about how these
[37:53] planes flying around, they just rattle
[37:54] the windows. Says when the plane has got
[37:56] so fast that it crosses its own sound
[37:58] called the sound barrier.
[38:00] And when it goes beyond its own sound
[38:02] barrier, it's almost unlimited what
[38:04] it'll do because it's it's pushing past
[38:07] these resistance. It's breaking through
[38:08] something is just kind of the image that
[38:10] he's taking in. And I think in there
[38:12] that we get a lesson when we go beyond
[38:14] our own sound barrier into the word of
[38:18] God, then it's unlimited what God can do
[38:21] with a man that's ready to go beyond the
[38:23] camp, the camp of man. That is
[38:26] why because if man set something up,
[38:28] that's a barrier. It always just always
[38:31] ask who built it. I think brother
[38:33] Michael, you even expressed it this way
[38:35] when we're fellowship. If there's
[38:36] something that's been built, ask who put
[38:37] it there. If man put it there, just go
[38:39] right around it.
[38:41] I if if if man built it, if man did it,
[38:44] then you said that's a barrier. Because
[38:45] that's what man does. He puts up
[38:47] barriers. But if God put it there, it's
[38:49] to be respected. We're talking about the
[38:50] word of God and the things that keep us
[38:52] from the word. It's to be respected.
[38:53] It's to be honored. He says when we go
[38:55] beyond our own sound barrier to the word
[38:56] of God, then it's unlimited what God can
[38:58] do with the man that's ready to go
[38:59] beyond the camp, the camp of man that
[39:01] is. Now we see that going beyond the
[39:02] camp, going beyond this, THAT'S THE TIME
[39:04] THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. LET'S GO BEYOND
[39:06] our denominational camps. Let's go
[39:07] beyond our clicks. Let's go beyond OUR
[39:09] POLITICS. GO BEYOND our pretense. Go
[39:11] beyond all these things of man that have
[39:13] made us feel real comfortable in the
[39:15] message, the cultures that we've
[39:16] created, AND GO BEYOND IT. Because those
[39:19] things may have seemed to be
[39:20] protections, BUT WHAT THEY BECAME is
[39:22] barriers.
[39:25] And it's the man-made barriers that made
[39:27] us vulnerable to something creeping in
[39:29] and bypassing ALL THE STRICT CONTROLS.
[39:31] AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TO, they can create
[39:32] this cult that everyone's just, "Yes,
[39:34] sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir." But all it
[39:36] takes is for someone to slip around
[39:37] behind those man-made controls and sew
[39:39] something into PEOPLE'S SPIRITS. AND
[39:41] THAT'S WHAT CAUSES THEM TO DISBELIEVE
[39:43] AND TO STUMBLE.
[39:46] We got to go beyond man-made barriers
[39:48] into the boundaries of God's word
[39:50] because that's the only place of safety.
[39:52] and the message perseverant. Brother
[39:54] Jared, I believe this is the one that
[39:55] you listen Saturday night mentioning how
[39:58] these sermons would be perfect to listen
[40:00] to. He says, ' AND MAYBE THERE'LL BE
[40:02] SOMEONE, he's praying in this service
[40:03] that God could come and do something
[40:05] that he's done before. If he could
[40:07] manifest himself in a way that shows
[40:08] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[40:10] forever. He says, MAYBE THERE'LL BE
[40:12] SOMEONE WITH FAITH enough to break
[40:13] through that barrier yonder, that sound
[40:15] barrier. Says that sin barrier, that
[40:18] unbelieving barrier yonder. break
[40:20] through that to where all things are
[40:22] possible.
[40:23] You recognize how he's using this kind
[40:25] of language. I want you to think very uh
[40:27] uh personally about this THAT ALL THINGS
[40:29] ARE possible but there's barriers that
[40:31] keeps you from it.
[40:33] There's barriers that keep you from
[40:34] coming into all things all things. Now
[40:37] there can be certain boundaries. You
[40:39] can't say ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE
[40:41] NAME OF WILLIAM BRANDOM,
[40:44] RIGHT? That's not the gate.
[40:47] That's not the door. It's not press play
[40:48] and obey and all of a sudden we're all
[40:50] just
[40:52] energized. No, that's not how it works,
[40:55] right? What the tape say. We'll say
[40:59] exactly how we preached it AND HOW WE
[41:00] TAUGHT IT. What what we see in the word
[41:02] of God is THERE CERTAIN WAYS. HERE'S THE
[41:04] WORD OF GOD. IT'S AVAILABLE FOR YOU, BUT
[41:05] you got to come through the right
[41:06] channel.
[41:08] But then there's other things that he's
[41:09] saying are a barrier to all things are
[41:12] possible. GOT TO GET PAST THE SIN
[41:14] BARRIER, the unbelieving barrier to
[41:15] where ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. IS
[41:17] GRANITE. LORD, WE'RE TOLD THAT WHEN THAT
[41:18] PLANE passes that sound barrier, it's
[41:21] limited in SPEED AND POWER. GOD, IF WE
[41:24] COULD JUST BREAK THROUGH THAT POWER OF
[41:26] UNBELIEF, miracles and things and
[41:28] promises OF GOD ARE UNLIMITED. FOR ALL
[41:30] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO HIM THAT
[41:32] BELIEVETH.
[41:36] Praise the Lord. All things are possible
[41:38] beyond the barrier, the man-made
[41:40] barrier, the satanic barrier, the
[41:41] unbelief barrier, your own personal
[41:43] sound barrier of your own words.
[41:45] Your own confession can become a
[41:46] barrier. Your own negative confession,
[41:49] your own words, your own, well, I think
[41:50] it's this way. And what you've done IS
[41:52] YOU'VE JUST PUT up a roadblock.
[41:54] Your thoughts, your ideas, THEY ALL
[41:55] BECOME SOUND BARRIERS. All the words
[41:57] you've ever said. And maybe some of us,
[41:59] what we NEED TO SAY, LORD, I'VE BEEN
[42:01] SAYING A LOT OF STUFF FOR a long time
[42:03] that's become a sound barrier to me. And
[42:04] God, by faith, I want to break through
[42:06] my own sound barrier, my own negative
[42:09] feedback, my own negative comments, my
[42:11] own negative, all the things I've been
[42:12] SPEAKING UP THIS GREAT BIG bank of
[42:15] unbelief that's keeping me from walking
[42:18] INTO ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE AND SAY,
[42:20] "OH, GOD, WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME
[42:22] WHERE I CAN BREAK PAST MY OWN SOUND
[42:24] BARRIER?"
[42:26] CAN ANYBODY RELATE HOW YOUR OWN WORDS
[42:28] AND
[42:30] YOUR OWN CONFESSIONS
[42:32] A BARRIER TO YOU WALKING IN THE VERY
[42:34] PROMISES OF AND YOU CAN SAY GOD I CAN
[42:36] BREAK THROUGH BY YOUR STRENGTH AND BY
[42:39] YOUR REACH MY OWN SOUND BARRIER perfect
[42:42] peace CAN BE MINE HEALING CAN BE MINE
[42:45] JOY CAN BE MINE DON'T LET MY OWN WORDS
[42:48] BE A BARRIER TO ALL THINGS ARE possible
[42:55] Now in Mark chapter 10 verse 27.
[42:58] Oh, this is so beautiful. And and if it
[43:01] doesn't sound beautiful to you, it's my
[43:02] fault. I'm just doing a horrible job.
[43:04] But this is beautiful. In Mark 10 27, it
[43:08] says, "Jesus looking upon them saith,
[43:10] with men it is impossible,
[43:13] but with God,
[43:16] but not with God, for with God all
[43:18] things are possible.
[43:25] With men it is impossible.
[43:28] What a statement.
[43:30] Not even talking about probability.
[43:31] Talking about possibility. It's
[43:32] completely impossible. But not with God.
[43:35] For with God all things are possible.
[43:40] I could put it this way. God can do
[43:41] whatever he wants.
[43:43] Right? We all agree God can do whatever
[43:47] he wants. He's God.
[43:50] He can do whatever he wants whenever he
[43:52] wants to. That's it's his power. It's in
[43:55] his providence.
[43:57] But by his own character, he chooses to
[44:00] work in a certain way.
[44:03] We could you imagine if we just all we
[44:05] just kind of if we were and this well
[44:07] you don't have to just look at the world
[44:09] that believes in a god but doesn't
[44:11] believe in his word,
[44:13] right? They believe that there's a god
[44:15] out there. And so you get over 9,000
[44:18] different interpretations of who Jesus
[44:19] is. And then you go beyond that and you
[44:22] have all these other religions and
[44:23] thoughts and all these other ideas. And
[44:25] hey, and you know what? The the satanic
[44:28] temple or the church of Satan is just a
[44:29] parody of all those other religion or
[44:31] all those other Christian churches and
[44:33] denominations. It's we all criticize the
[44:36] temple of Satan or whatever and we cast
[44:37] them out as being these devil
[44:39] worshippers. But you know, you're the
[44:41] one that literally believes in the
[44:42] devil, right? Not the church of Satan.
[44:45] the Satanic Temple. Christians are the
[44:47] ones that literally believe in a devil.
[44:49] They do it as a parody
[44:51] of Christians. They do it as a parody of
[44:54] all the Christian denominations that
[44:56] want to be activist and THEY WANT TO
[44:57] FIGHT THIS AND DO THIS. SO, THEY JUST
[44:58] SET UP their own par say, "We ought to
[45:00] have a right to do this, TOO."
[45:02] LET'S NOT BE SUCKED INTO the parody
[45:06] of Christianity and this fight that's
[45:08] being WAGED AMONGST ALL THESE OTHER
[45:10] THINGS OUT THERE. THEY'RE JUST A
[45:11] DISTRACTION. WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN
[45:13] GIVEN A WORD. We're not just kind of
[45:15] left on our own. WELL, WE KNOW THERE'S
[45:17] ACTUALLY a God, so let's just do it in
[45:18] the best we can. And well, you he spoke
[45:20] to you that way. Oh, that's really good.
[45:22] That's interesting. Well, he spoke to me
[45:23] this way. And we all just kind of
[45:24] believe in the divine and we're trying
[45:25] to find our way around this world and
[45:27] we're just going to pick the person that
[45:28] we think that has the most wisdom and
[45:30] follow their precepts. We have been
[45:32] given a word and God has IDENTIFIED
[45:34] HIMSELF WITH HIS WORD AND HE'S FULFILLED
[45:36] HIS WORD TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE KNOWN. SO
[45:38] EVEN THOUGH GOD COULD DO WHATEVER HE
[45:40] WANTS, HE CHOOSES TO be bound by his
[45:43] word.
[45:45] With men it is impossible, but not with
[45:47] God. For with God all things are
[45:49] possible.
[45:52] In Mark chapter 9 verse 23, Jesus saith
[45:54] unto him, "If thou can't believe, all
[45:56] things are possible to him that
[45:58] believeth."
[46:00] So all things are possible with God.
[46:03] But for us,
[46:05] we can only access that if we believe.
[46:10] God can do whatever he wants, but the
[46:12] only way that we're going to enjoy what
[46:14] he does is if we believe.
[46:16] If you can believe, all things are
[46:18] possible to you if you believe. Brother
[46:22] said there's no limit to the faith of
[46:23] God that he left for his church because
[46:25] he said all things are possible to them
[46:26] that believe. He says it's not limited.
[46:30] All right. Now, I don't know if you're
[46:31] going I'm just being which way are we
[46:35] going, brother Aaron? You're trying to
[46:36] lean into the turn and then I go the
[46:37] other way. It's a paradox, isn't it?
[46:40] He's unlimited, but he's limited. But
[46:42] he's unlimited.
[46:45] It's the way that God is. I think
[46:47] brother Jason was talking about paradox.
[46:48] It's true, but it's not. But yet, it is,
[46:51] but it's not. Paradoxes can be resolved
[46:54] in different ways. We'll find that with
[46:55] God, they all resolve themselves to be
[46:57] true.
[46:59] But we think about this, God can do
[47:01] whatever he wants. God is unlimited. The
[47:03] power of God, the the expanse of God.
[47:05] But I want you just to in your own
[47:07] finite way just to acknowledge this is a
[47:09] God that's beyond grasp. He cannot be
[47:11] contained. But yet then God is willing
[47:13] to be understood.
[47:15] He's willing to make himself known. But
[47:17] then he says all things are possible but
[47:19] to them that believe.
[47:21] Why? And he says faith is unlimited.
[47:25] All things are possible to them that
[47:26] believe. He says it's not limited. There
[47:28] is no limit to the faith of God that he
[47:29] left for his church. But God's not a
[47:31] genie in the bottle.
[47:34] like, "Oh, look what I found." God is
[47:36] not a fairy godmother
[47:39] where he's just accessible on our whims.
[47:41] Oh, I want God. Let me go get the
[47:42] bottle. Oh, I want God. Fairy Godmother
[47:44] appear. And we got to do some just hold
[47:46] our hands a certain way and kind of
[47:47] blink and here he comes. God's not that
[47:48] way. He's not obedient to our whims as a
[47:51] genie in the bottle. I'll grant you a
[47:52] wish. Any wish you want, I'll give it to
[47:54] you. That's not how God works. That's
[47:57] not how his word works.
[47:59] Ban writes this in the church age book
[48:02] in chapter 4. He says,"I wonder if we
[48:04] are sufficiently impressed with the word
[48:06] in our midst."
[48:08] I love that statement. He says, "Let me
[48:10] give you a thought here. How do we pray?
[48:13] We pray in Jesus name, don't we? Every
[48:15] prayer is in his name or there isn't any
[48:17] answer."
[48:19] Yet in 1 John 5:14, we are told, "This
[48:21] is the confidence that we have in him,
[48:23] that if we ask anything according to his
[48:25] will, he heareth us. And if we know that
[48:27] he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know
[48:29] that we have the petitions that we
[48:31] desired of him. Now we ask, what is the
[48:34] will of God? There is only one way to
[48:37] know his will, and that is by the word
[48:40] of God. LAMENTATIONS 3:37, WHO IS HE
[48:43] THAT SAITH, and it cometh to pass when
[48:45] the Lord commandeth it not? He says,
[48:47] there it is. If it isn't in the word,
[48:49] you can't have it.
[48:52] Just accept it. If it isn't his word,
[48:55] say, "I don't want it." Right? There's
[49:00] nothing in his will that I fear and
[49:03] nothing out of his will that I want.
[49:06] Nothing in his will that I fear, nothing
[49:08] out of his will that I want. We're not
[49:10] neutral in this. Ah, it doesn't matter,
[49:11] Lord. Your will, devil's will, it
[49:13] doesn't really matter. I'm neutral.
[49:14] Wrong. I am not neutral. I want your
[49:16] way, God.
[49:18] If it isn't in the word, you can't have
[49:20] it. No. Right. God's not you can't have
[49:24] it. If it's not in the word, this is
[49:26] this is a limit. If it isn't in the
[49:29] word, you can't have it. And we
[49:32] shouldn't go, "Oh,
[49:34] yes. Thank you, Lord. I'm not going to
[49:37] get anything THAT'S NOT YOUR WORD.
[49:39] THAT'S MY DESIRE. IF IT'S NOT IN THE
[49:41] WORD, I DON'T WANT IT. If it isn't in
[49:42] the word, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT." SO, WE
[49:44] CAN'T ASK UNLESS it's in the word. And
[49:46] we can't petition or ask unless it
[49:47] unless it's in his name. He says, "There
[49:49] it is again. Jesus, the name is the word
[49:51] will." You can't separate God and the
[49:53] word. They are one.
[49:55] What has brother Brandham done? And I
[49:57] believe maybe IN JUST A SUBTLE WAY, HE'S
[49:59] SAYING we pray in the name of Jesus and
[50:02] whatever we we can't have what we ask
[50:03] unless we ask it in his name. But then
[50:06] the Bible SAYS WE HAVE TO ASK ACCORDING
[50:08] to his will.
[50:10] God is not he's NOT GOING TO BE HE'S NOT
[50:12] A CLOWN. HE'S NOT JUST GOING TO CLOWN
[50:13] for us. Lord, give me the best job and
[50:15] Lord, give me this money and Lord, I
[50:16] want her to be my wife. I ask it in the
[50:18] name of Jesus and I'm going to confess
[50:19] it. Did you know God told me that I'm
[50:21] going to marry you?
[50:22] Right? We don't do that BECAUSE THAT'S
[50:24] NOT THE WAY THAT IT WORKS. THERE'S A way
[50:26] speaking of boundaries. Come on,
[50:27] somebody.
[50:30] If it's in the word, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.
[50:33] BROTHER BRANDHAM IN A VERY SUBTLE WAY IS
[50:35] IDENTIFYING BOUNDARIES.
[50:37] Identifying the parameters, THE THINGS
[50:39] WE OUGHT TO BELIEVE FOR, the things that
[50:40] we can find safety, the things that GIVE
[50:42] US SHELTER, AND HE'S IDENTIFYING THE
[50:44] PROPER APPROACH to God.
[50:46] I I I hope that this COULD JUST BE
[50:48] EXPOUNDED UPON IN THE FUTURE SERVICES. I
[50:50] I want to wind this down.
[50:52] He's these things that we've used even
[50:55] through the deliberate use of these
[50:56] scriptures and quotations tonight. We're
[50:59] identifying the characteristics of Jesus
[51:01] Christ
[51:03] that he himself is confined
[51:07] in just using our language. He has
[51:10] limited himself. He's he's chosen to
[51:12] place his name in something that is uh
[51:14] that is seems to have bound bounds.
[51:18] So it's his character to do this and
[51:20] it's also identifying how that it's the
[51:22] character of Christ to respect
[51:23] boundaries.
[51:26] It's just something about him.
[51:29] Now my closing scripture in Revelations
[51:31] chapter 3, well I just realized I have
[51:33] another one I may want to read. So one
[51:35] of my closing scriptures, Revelations
[51:37] chapter 3, verse 20.
[51:45] Behold, I stand at the door and kick it
[51:48] down.
[51:51] That's what the lessen Bible says,
[51:53] right?
[51:55] Behold, I stand at the door and I begin
[51:57] to pe I walk around back and I peek in
[51:59] the window. I check to see if there's
[52:00] any other doors that are unlocked. No.
[52:02] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[52:04] What a gentleman.
[52:07] Here's a door. It's shut.
[52:09] You know the B brother B says he's a
[52:11] fugitive in his own church. He's been
[52:13] kicked out of his own church. But
[52:15] because the door's been shut to him,
[52:17] he's going to knock.
[52:19] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[52:21] If any man hear my voice
[52:24] and open the door, I will come into him
[52:29] and will suck with him and he can suck
[52:31] with me.
[52:33] This is God following an order. This is
[52:35] speaking something to us about God's
[52:37] nature, his character, that if a door is
[52:39] closed,
[52:41] he's going to knock. Is he able to kick
[52:44] the door down? I mean, this isn't
[52:46] philosophy. Can God create a rock so
[52:48] heavy that even God can't lift it? Yeah,
[52:51] we're not the sophist, you know,
[52:52] pondering, you know, all hopping on
[52:54] goofballs. Think about how big God is
[52:56] and whether or not he could create a
[52:57] rock too big for himself to carry. This
[52:59] is reasonable. Could God not in this
[53:01] sense just kick the door down? Couldn't
[53:04] he just go scatter moosh and the walls
[53:06] fall away? Right? He could just do
[53:07] whatever he wants. But he says, "I stand
[53:10] at the door and knock. If any man hear
[53:14] my voice and open the door, I'll come
[53:16] into him and we'll s with him and he
[53:18] with me." He's not even beating on the
[53:20] door. He He He's not yelling, but it's
[53:24] in such a way to where he's you there
[53:27] will you open to me for a still small
[53:30] voice. Meanwhile, lightning and
[53:33] earthquakes and thunders and all these
[53:34] revivals shaking the world. And he's
[53:36] just there knocking the still small
[53:38] voice.
[53:40] And if any man will hear that
[53:42] gentleness,
[53:44] hear that that that that meekness of
[53:47] Christ, the simple way that he comes,
[53:50] he'll if you'll open the door to him, he
[53:53] comes in.
[53:54] This is Christ respecting a boundary.
[53:57] The door was put there for a reason.
[53:58] They say, "Well, it was to keep them
[53:59] out." But it's there. And that's the
[54:02] point where you can have fellowship.
[54:03] Brother Bram says in the message, Jesus
[54:05] at the door, and that's the way it is.
[54:07] Notice how he phrases this. The latch is
[54:09] on the inside. Christ knocks at the
[54:11] door, but you have to open the door. He
[54:14] will not against your will.
[54:18] He gives you the ability to let him let
[54:20] him in. But he will, if I can say it
[54:22] this way, he cannot
[54:24] force himself in.
[54:27] for there's no latch for him to come in
[54:29] by. You must open the door.
[54:34] You've got to do it. You've got to open
[54:37] the door. The fact that there's no latch
[54:40] there show it speaks of how he will not
[54:42] do it against your will. HOW MANY TIMES
[54:45] DO WE PRAY, "OH GOD, IF YOU WILL, GOD,
[54:47] IF YOU WILL, GOD, IF YOU WILL, GOD, IF
[54:48] YOU WILL, GOD, HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP,
[54:50] HELP, HELP, HELP." AND WE'RE ALWAYS
[54:52] ASKING. HE SAYS, "WELL, I'm kind of
[54:53] standing at the door knocking. You just
[54:55] need to open it up.
[54:59] And if I could say it this way, you'll
[55:00] never find a door if you don't know
[55:02] anything about boundaries.
[55:04] You could be knock you could be
[55:06] listening for him at a wall. You could
[55:07] be listen for him here. God want running
[55:08] up and down a wall. Run up and down a
[55:10] wall. But you find him at the door.
[55:13] And I say this, we invite the musicians
[55:15] to come. I want to say this in closing.
[55:18] As it says in Matthew chapter 7, verses
[55:21] 7 and 8, ask and it shall be given to
[55:23] you. Seek and you shall find.
[55:26] Knock and it shall be open unto you. You
[55:29] have to be asking, seeking, and
[55:32] knocking. For everyone that askketh
[55:34] receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,
[55:36] and to him that knockketh it shall be
[55:37] opened. You find the door. The knock is
[55:40] at the door. It's not pounding on a
[55:42] wall. It's not just yelling into the
[55:44] abyss. It's not just screaming, hoping
[55:46] that something is transforms and
[55:48] something transpires, but identifying
[55:50] where he is and and coming to him and
[55:53] identifying him at the door. And I love
[55:55] the image that brother Brad this picture
[56:02] and if you could still stay with me here
[56:06] as I close this if you could be very
[56:08] very personal in your own hearts now.
[56:12] If you have a need maybe you could just
[56:14] present it before the Lord at this very
[56:15] moment.
[56:18] He says he will not come in against your
[56:21] will.
[56:23] He cannot force himself in
[56:28] the says in another place he won't force
[56:29] you to do it.
[56:33] I said tonight open up and let him in.
[56:39] Lord, if I'm a house,
[56:43] if I am defined by certain parameters
[56:46] and boundaries
[56:48] and Lord, I'm all yours.
[56:51] every room,
[56:53] every door.
[56:57] I've pondered this now for weeks and
[56:59] I've come to realize
[57:01] he's the only [music] that we can truly
[57:03] trust with full access.
[57:07] And so [music] things happen in life
[57:11] to cause us to withhold [music] consent
[57:14] from Christ.
[57:16] Satan had us deliberately try to put us
[57:19] into circumstances that freeze us up and
[57:23] trigger [music] us and lock us up to
[57:25] where I I I I I want I want to withhold
[57:28] my consent. I do not want to allow I do
[57:31] not want to give permission.
[57:34] But tonight he's knocking at a door in
[57:36] your heart. And you have to give him
[57:39] permission.
[57:41] You may be huddled up in the corner of
[57:43] that closet with the door barred shut,
[57:45] saying, "Lord, if you love me, kick the
[57:46] door down, [music] but he wants you to
[57:49] trust him to unlock the door and let him
[57:52] in."
[57:57] Say to him, "This is your vessel, Lord.
[58:02] I give to you my body, which [music] is
[58:04] my reasonable servant.
[58:07] Possess me to the limits, Lord.
[58:11] Fill up all the boundaries.
[58:16] Maybe you could ask it this way.
[58:19] Lord, what is it that's keeping you from
[58:21] loving me?
[58:24] He loves you,
[58:26] but there's something the door that
[58:28] stands [music] between you and his love.
[58:32] And in there
[58:34] and there, he's knocking at that door.
[58:37] And it's that door you have to open
[58:39] [music] to experience the love that you
[58:42] you're l you you want to feel because
[58:45] again he's he's a he's that [music]
[58:46] gentleman. He's he he he's honoring
[58:48] something. He's respecting something and
[58:50] even because of what maybe you've gone
[58:52] through [music] in life. He's not just
[58:53] going to force himself through that.
[58:54] He's just waiting for you to come to
[58:56] that place of trust. What do you find?
[59:00] And I admire it when [music] people have
[59:01] that kind of nature. You take a dog
[59:02] that's been abused and and they're
[59:04] skittish and they're very fearful.
[59:06] There's a way that people know how to
[59:07] approach that dog. And sometimes they
[59:09] get all they get their fur up, they
[59:11] growl and they're going to dip at you.
[59:13] But there's a way that [music] you just
[59:14] humble yourself and make yourself
[59:17] available in a non-threatening way that
[59:20] [music] eventually. Am I getting it
[59:22] right? I'm not a dog whisperer.
[59:24] And you make yourself available and v
[59:26] vulnerable in a non-threatening way. And
[59:28] it breaks down the dog. Even though
[59:30] abused for years and so many bound up
[59:33] and so fearful, it it recognizes I can
[59:35] trust. He's demonstrating trust. This is
[59:38] someone I can approach. I I'm I'm
[59:40] sensing something different. And it
[59:41] calls to that one. And that dog begins
[59:43] to let down its defenses and comes to
[59:45] the hand that's being extended in a
[59:48] non-threatening way. A and that dog
[59:51] longs for that connection. It longs
[59:53] [music] for that kind of nurture. It
[59:54] longs for those affections. It's it's
[59:56] kind of nature. It's it's in its nature.
[59:58] And if we could just kind of flip that.
[59:59] Maybe we've been through so many things
[1:00:01] in our lives where we find oh speaking
[1:00:04] back a little bit scared unwilling and
[1:00:06] we're wanting God to blow right past
[1:00:08] that and just kind of snatch us. Just
[1:00:10] grab a HOLD OF ME. TAKE ME GOD. BUT
[1:00:12] YOU'RE AFRAID of that. You've
[1:00:14] experienced way too many situations
[1:00:16] where people have taken advantage and
[1:00:18] taken control and misused the word of
[1:00:20] God. REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID ON SUNDAY.
[1:00:21] This message has been used to abuse and
[1:00:24] to control and has profaneed the name of
[1:00:26] God and God to lift back up and restore
[1:00:29] confidence and faith in this word. And
[1:00:31] he's not going to do it with the same
[1:00:32] kind of arrogance and assumptions that
[1:00:34] have brought the people to a place of
[1:00:36] reservation.
[1:00:39] And so he's present here tonight making
[1:00:41] himself available to you. And he's
[1:00:43] searching wanting us to search our
[1:00:45] hearts and say, "Lord, I know that you
[1:00:46] love me and you want to love me. So,
[1:00:50] what is it [music] I'm using to keep you
[1:00:52] from loving me?
[1:00:55] I realized [music]
[1:00:56] in a very personal way just how much
[1:01:00] love I have in my heart for my family
[1:01:02] and all the [music] barriers that keep
[1:01:04] it from coming out.
[1:01:06] The love is true. It's genuine. It's
[1:01:09] full. It's faithful. It's rich. But I
[1:01:11] find things sometimes in my life just
[1:01:13] don't let it come out the way that I
[1:01:14] want to. And I purpose [music] in my
[1:01:17] heart, let every barrier be removed.
[1:01:19] Anything that keeps me from loving my
[1:01:22] wife the way that I ought to. [music]
[1:01:23] Anything that keeps me from loving my
[1:01:24] children the way they ought to. Because
[1:01:26] the love is genuine. The love is real.
[1:01:28] But it's [music] just the barriers that
[1:01:29] keep it from coming out.
[1:01:32] What's keeping you from loving him?
[1:01:36] [music] Brother Vanaman message going
[1:01:37] beyond the camp. Maybe just bow your
[1:01:39] heads as we read this in closing.
[1:01:41] And going beyond the camp, he says they
[1:01:43] were on their road talking about Israel
[1:01:44] in the Exodus and the coming out of
[1:01:46] their rapture [music] from Egypt into
[1:01:48] the promised land. And they were on
[1:01:49] their road by a vindicated light, a
[1:01:51] vindicated prophet with signs and
[1:01:52] wonders that God was in the camp and
[1:01:54] they were on their road.
[1:01:57] They had a pillar of fire. They had a
[1:01:58] prophet. They had mana. They had living
[1:02:01] waters. [music] They had changed
[1:02:03] campgrounds.
[1:02:05] He said they had changed changed
[1:02:07] campgrounds. They had to do it. They
[1:02:11] could see those things. [music] And
[1:02:17] sometimes we have to change where we're
[1:02:18] camping.
[1:02:22] [music] If you want to see the sunrise,
[1:02:23] make sure you're camping on the right
[1:02:24] side of the mountain.
[1:02:26] If you want to see the [music] sunset,
[1:02:27] you want to make sure you're set camping
[1:02:29] on the right side of the mountain.
[1:02:30] Sometimes you have to change your
[1:02:31] position to see the [music] scene that
[1:02:33] you want. He said they had changed
[1:02:35] changed campgrounds. They had to do it.
[1:02:37] They couldn't see those things in Egypt.
[1:02:39] They had to change the campgrounds in
[1:02:41] order to see the supernatural. [music]
[1:02:44] So will the people of this day have to
[1:02:46] change the camp. You'll have to change
[1:02:48] your campgrounds, go beyond that camp
[1:02:51] [music] to where all things are
[1:02:53] possible. Oh, may it be an encouragement
[1:02:56] to all those who are here to hear my
[1:02:57] voice tonight [music] that if you
[1:02:59] haven't been experiencing the
[1:03:01] supernatural, if you haven't been
[1:03:03] experiencing all things ARE POSSIBLE,
[1:03:05] THEY STILL ARE POSSIBLE. THE
[1:03:07] SUPERNATURAL IS STILL PRESENT HERE
[1:03:08] AMONGST US. BUT IT'S THE MAN-MADE
[1:03:10] CAMPGROUNDS. It's the HOAs. It's all the
[1:03:13] campgrounds. ALL THE ALL THE MAN-MADE
[1:03:15] BARRIERS THAT HAVE KEPT US FROM ENJOYING
[1:03:17] AND SEEING THE SUPERNATURAL. BUT OH GOD,
[1:03:20] I DESIRE TONIGHT TO GO BEYOND THE CAMP.
[1:03:23] SO I'M PICKING UP MY FAITH. I'M PICKING
[1:03:25] UP MY DESIRES. I'M PICKING UP MY
[1:03:27] EXPECTATION AND I'M MOVING INTO THE
[1:03:30] place where all things are possible.
[1:03:33] I won't sit here any longer. We've
[1:03:36] compassed this mountain long enough. I'm
[1:03:38] changing campgrounds. I'm getting OUT OF
[1:03:39] THE MAN-MADE CAMP. I'M GOING BEYOND THE
[1:03:42] BOUNDARIES THAT HAVE BECOME A BARRIER TO
[1:03:44] THE WOMB OF GOD. AND I'M GOING TO walk
[1:03:46] in his present move
[1:03:49] into where all things are possible.
[1:03:52] [music] Could you tonight in your own
[1:03:54] heart
[1:03:56] say, "Lord, I believe in you."
[1:04:01] And in believing Lord,
[1:04:04] I'm [music] I'm answer tonight. The
[1:04:07] knock door.
[1:04:11] I'm lifting your hands [music] and say,
[1:04:13] "Here I am. Take all of me,
[1:04:17] Lord. I'm all yours tonight.
[1:04:20] I'm withholding nothing, Lord.
[1:04:22] I'm not going to let [music] any barrier
[1:04:25] keep you from
[1:04:28] whatever is keeping I I I guess maybe I
[1:04:30] could read it. I [music]
[1:04:32] if I had this on my heart to use, I
[1:04:34] think I will use it.
[1:04:37] I have it in my this
[1:04:41] for one of the future services. He says,
[1:04:43] Lord, thou known me.
[1:04:48] 139, thou knowest my downsitting and my
[1:04:50] uprising. Thou understandeth my thought
[1:04:52] a far [music] off. Thou compasseth my
[1:04:54] path in my lying down, and art
[1:04:56] acquainted with all my ways. For there
[1:04:58] is not a word in my tongue, but
[1:05:02] thou hast me behind and before and laid
[1:05:05] thy head upon [music] me. You've hemmed
[1:05:08] me in, Lord, is one trick.
[1:05:16] It is high
[1:05:18] [music]
[1:05:19] with go from thy.
[1:05:24] If I ascend up into heaven, thou art
[1:05:26] there. If I make in hell, thou art
[1:05:29] there. If I take the wings of the
[1:05:31] morning, dwell in the uttermost part of
[1:05:33] the sea, even there shall thy hand lead
[1:05:35] me. [music] In thy right hand shall hold
[1:05:37] me. If I say, Surely the darkness shall
[1:05:39] cover me, even the night shall be light
[1:05:42] unto me. Yay, the darkness hideth not
[1:05:46] from thee, and shineth as the day. The
[1:05:48] darkness and the light are both a light
[1:05:49] [music] to thee. For thou hast possessed
[1:05:52] my reigns. Thou hast covered me in my
[1:05:54] mother's womb. Could you accept that
[1:05:56] [music] for yourself tonight?
[1:05:58] I
[1:06:01] fear and wonderfully [music]
[1:06:04] made and marvelous are thy works and
[1:06:08] that [music] my soul knoweth right well.
[1:06:13] I say trust him [music] tonight. Trust
[1:06:14] him with everything that is in you for
[1:06:16] the healing you crave, the peace you
[1:06:18] desire, that your foot [music]
[1:06:21] where you could feel that you're
[1:06:23] standing on a solid place. So
[1:06:29] ahead,
[1:06:31] would you pray with
[1:06:34] sleep right? Be afraid to lift [music]
[1:06:37] your voice if you must, but let your
[1:06:40] voice be heard. Gracious heavenly
[1:06:42] father.
[1:06:45] Lord, as we lifting up our hands and our
[1:06:48] hearts to you tonight, our heart's cry
[1:06:50] is Lord, [music] come fill your vessel,
[1:06:53] Lord.
[1:06:54] If it is your desire to fill [music]
[1:06:56] every fiber of this being, Lord, I don't
[1:06:58] want to hold anything back from you.
[1:07:02] Lord, our relationship is not one of an
[1:07:04] acquaintance. Lord, I do not want you to
[1:07:06] come and visit my house and be a
[1:07:08] wallflower.
[1:07:09] I do not want you to be a Jesus with
[1:07:11] dirty feet. Lord, not only do I welcome
[1:07:15] to the but Lord private
[1:07:20] to the secret [music] place.
[1:07:22] I welcome you, Lord.
[1:07:25] Lord, we find it so difficult to be
[1:07:27] honest with one another.
[1:07:30] Lord, some of us are in relationships
[1:07:32] where love
[1:07:36] by words. It's coded in actions [music]
[1:07:38] and sometimes
[1:07:40] are almost u
[1:07:44] cryptic.
[1:07:46] It's so hard to discern how one feel and
[1:07:49] then we crave it and we long it
[1:07:51] expressed
[1:07:53] certain measures.
[1:07:56] It can [music] just be withheld from us.
[1:07:58] And Lord, even we ourselves may be able
[1:08:00] to recognize just how hard it is to love
[1:08:03] when we want to.
[1:08:05] And we want to say things and we want to
[1:08:07] express things and we want to have
[1:08:08] liberty to do things, but so many
[1:08:11] barriers are built up in the natural
[1:08:13] that keeps us from it.
[1:08:16] Lord, I believe that
[1:08:19] you are a God that can blow past any
[1:08:23] barrier,
[1:08:26] overcome any barrier,
[1:08:29] push past any obstacle, any impediment,
[1:08:32] any
[1:08:36] Lord, the last thing that remains
[1:08:38] [music] is my consent
[1:08:41] and my permission.
[1:08:43] Lord, if I could not go on to perfection
[1:08:46] unless [music] you permitted it, Lord,
[1:08:48] you will not come in and to perfect me
[1:08:50] unless I permit it. And oh God, I give
[1:08:54] you consent, Lord. It's not ambiguous,
[1:08:58] Lord. I'm not just sending signals. I'm
[1:09:00] saying, GOD, YOU CAN HAVE ALL OF ME
[1:09:02] TONIGHT, LORD. EVERY PART, EVERY
[1:09:05] AMBITION, every thought, every deed,
[1:09:08] every action, EVERY POSSESSION, LORD.
[1:09:11] EVERYTHING, it's yours.
[1:09:15] [music]
[1:09:15] A and and I give it to you to use it as
[1:09:18] you would see fit. Lord, I do not say
[1:09:22] that I have received this gift. Let me
[1:09:24] use it for your glory. But Lord, that
[1:09:26] which you have given me, I give it back
[1:09:28] to you. May you use it for your glory.
[1:09:31] Lord, my my wonderful children, the four
[1:09:33] of them and their character THAT IS
[1:09:36] BEING BUILT AND all the potential that
[1:09:38] they have. Lord, my wife and I dedicated
[1:09:41] them to you at an altar of at the time
[1:09:43] of their birth. Lord, once again, if
[1:09:46] [music] I have taken control at all, I
[1:09:48] GIVE IT BACK TO YOU unreservedly because
[1:09:51] I trust you, Lord. I do so with my
[1:09:54] marriage. I DO SO WITH MY MIND. I DO SO
[1:09:56] WITH my finances. I DO MY TIME, LORD. I
[1:09:59] HAVE NOTHING. NOTHING in my possession.
[1:10:02] Nothing in the recesses OF MY MIND.
[1:10:04] NOTHING IN A IN AN ENCRYPTED FOLDER.
[1:10:06] LORD, YOU HAVE THE KEY. YOU HAVE THE
[1:10:09] PASSWORD. YOU HAVE THAT WHICH UNLOCKS
[1:10:12] WHO I AM. OH GOD, IF ALL YOU WERE
[1:10:14] WAITING FOR WAS THE CONSENT, LORD, I
[1:10:17] GIVE IT TO YOU TONIGHT.
[1:10:21] And I ask you, FATHER, I WELCOME YOU,
[1:10:24] LORD. RATHER, I welcome you.
[1:10:28] I welcome you to come in Lord.
[1:10:33] Thank you Jesus. [music]
[1:10:36] Thank you Jesus.
[1:10:38] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:10:40] [music] pray.
[1:10:42] Amen.
