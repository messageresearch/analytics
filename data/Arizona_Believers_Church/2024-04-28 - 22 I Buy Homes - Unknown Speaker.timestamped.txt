[0:00] on Wednesday night we were speaking on
[0:02] housed but homeless I want to give a
[0:04] quick review on that it does TI tie into
[0:07] where we were last Sunday on the
[0:09] unhoused and the homeless we kind of use
[0:11] that phrasing just to break up the fact
[0:14] that uh you can be unhoused and you
[0:16] could be homeless or you could be uh
[0:19] unhoused but yet have a home and some
[0:21] sense of community and we were focusing
[0:23] more on the idea that you can have a
[0:25] house but still not have what really
[0:27] makes a home and that was our thought on
[0:30] Wednesday night on housed but homeless
[0:32] and how that brother brandham begins to
[0:34] identify what a home is and what home
[0:36] life should be and what makes a house a
[0:38] home uh those a lot of that was just
[0:40] review principles for us and we're kind
[0:42] of arriving at this thought that we're
[0:44] not having a housing crisis but we have
[0:46] a home crisis and where we are homeless
[0:49] is there's less love there's less
[0:51] support there's less togetherness and
[0:53] there's less closeness and brother
[0:55] Brandon begins to look at this in his
[0:56] day and age and see that everyone's off
[0:59] doing something else in some of the
[1:01] family activities of prayer and reading
[1:03] the Bible and this togetherness is lost
[1:05] and being divided and being fractured I
[1:08] even think in some ways um everyone
[1:10] being at home all the time whether it be
[1:13] uh homeschool and working at home and
[1:15] let me just say this now as a church we
[1:16] don't have uh any kind of homeschool
[1:19] agenda uh matter of fact I think you
[1:21] should be more prayerful about
[1:22] homeschooling and maybe even you should
[1:24] about sending kids to school uh because
[1:26] it's not just it's not for everyone so
[1:28] if I mention homeschool just because we
[1:30] do it doesn't mean you should doesn't
[1:31] mean it's the right way uh the right way
[1:33] is how you feel led and God will bless
[1:36] you in either one of those public school
[1:38] private school homeschooling just let
[1:40] the Lord have his way and he will watch
[1:41] out over you let me just say it if your
[1:43] kids go to public school God's Great
[1:45] there too he can keep and they can
[1:47] educate them they can keep them they can
[1:48] have a testimony and they can win souls
[1:50] by their witness at school and I'm just
[1:53] thinking in this way that sometimes
[1:55] since we're always at home together and
[1:57] the mother's at home teaching the kids
[1:59] the dad at home working uh always
[2:02] together that the fact that we're always
[2:03] around each other we take that time for
[2:05] granted so there's no real quality time
[2:07] together always in one another's
[2:09] proximity but never never really in one
[2:11] another's presence and so it's just that
[2:13] kind of day and age to the advancement
[2:15] of technology and the things that uh we
[2:17] appreciate and enjoy can just fracture
[2:19] us and we have less time together less
[2:22] love less support and that's where I'd
[2:23] say we're homeless because we have less
[2:26] home and I want to uh
[2:30] I'd like to be get get into some very
[2:32] specifics and you probably hear me say
[2:34] that a lot and you're wondering when am
[2:35] I when am I going to get specific but uh
[2:39] practically how are we settling for just
[2:42] having a house but not having a vision
[2:45] for home life where we're so busy making
[2:48] sure we have the house and the house
[2:50] paid and the car and all these things
[2:51] we're so busy about those natural things
[2:53] that we've never really taken time to
[2:55] have a vision for home life for
[2:57] relationships and for life outside of
[2:59] the home for our children and what would
[3:01] that look like and so we should ask
[3:03] ourselves what should a home look like
[3:05] what should it feel like what ought a
[3:07] home provide what are the things that a
[3:09] home should provide because a house
[3:11] gives us Shelter From The Elements a
[3:12] house gives us a place to keep our
[3:14] possessions a house gives us a place to
[3:16] lay our head uh those are tangibles what
[3:19] are the intangibles that home ought to
[3:21] provide that are missing so that we're
[3:23] essentially housed but homeless if
[3:25] they're not there and if I could say
[3:28] this this is our been kind of the
[3:31] driving inspiration is a vision will get
[3:35] us out of homelessness a vision will get
[3:38] us out of homeless revelation of God's
[3:40] will will get us out of homelessness
[3:42] that if we follow in in God's will
[3:44] sometimes we can find ourselves in
[3:46] places where we have certain things that
[3:48] are provided but it doesn't feel like
[3:49] homes so what do we need we need God's
[3:51] will to find home to be at rest to be at
[3:55] peace and so that applies to the
[3:58] individual applies to families and
[3:59] applies to a church you could you ought
[4:01] to be finding um that in your own
[4:03] individual lives we need to find that as
[4:05] a family and as a church uh there needs
[4:07] to be a vision for that as well now
[4:10] let's look together at Proverbs chapter
[4:11] 24 as we're still we're transitioning
[4:15] now from how but homeless and I'll give
[4:16] you my title here just in a moment
[4:19] Proverbs 24: 3 and 4 through wisdom is a
[4:23] house builded and by understanding it is
[4:27] established and by knowledge shall the
[4:29] Chambers be filled with all precious and
[4:31] pleasant riches if you take notes write
[4:33] those three words down wisdom
[4:36] understanding knowledge somewhere in a
[4:37] column maybe depending on how you do it
[4:39] maybe even just right there you could
[4:41] underline them uh uh and put a box
[4:43] around them something just to say these
[4:45] are three words uh that we want to be
[4:47] listening for today because wisdom
[4:49] builds the house understanding is what
[4:53] establishes it and is going to if you
[4:56] want to say frame it or erect it uh in
[4:59] in such a way to held together and then
[5:01] knowledge is going to um put the things
[5:05] in it that make it happy and pleasant
[5:07] and precious and so wisdom we could say
[5:09] is the foundation of the home
[5:11] understanding Builds on that wisdom and
[5:13] then knowledge is going to fill it and
[5:15] if we're looking at ourselves as
[5:16] individuals or as a family as a church
[5:18] we realize that we W uh the fear of the
[5:20] Lord is the beginning of wisdom faith is
[5:22] that fear that reverence and respect and
[5:24] so we see that we're established on a
[5:26] basis then God wants to give us
[5:28] understanding so that we grow and
[5:30] knowledge and understanding and
[5:31] Revelation and through that and then
[5:33] knowledge of the Divine knowledge of the
[5:35] Holy those things begin to fill us up to
[5:38] where there's No Vacancy and there's no
[5:40] nothing that is empty so wisdom builds
[5:43] understanding establishes knowledge
[5:45] fills now that's uh that's one of the
[5:47] key Parts there for this morning now my
[5:50] title is I'm quoting the devil I buy
[5:55] homes anybody ever seen the Billboards
[5:57] We Buy Houses all right well there's
[6:00] another company you may not have heard
[6:01] of and it's I buy homes and I'm quoting
[6:04] Satan and so we've used this for
[6:05] dramatic effect this title slide and if
[6:07] it seems a little dark to you this was
[6:09] less dark than the other ones I came up
[6:11] with we did a little uh testing at home
[6:13] a little marketing and we found that
[6:15] this one would result in fewer uh
[6:18] nightmares um and the cartoon one just
[6:21] wasn't pulling it off so this is Satan
[6:24] as a a home buyer and when I say I buy
[6:28] homes I'm quoting the devil today and I
[6:30] I'm wanting to do this in a way to kind
[6:31] of get your attention and get you
[6:33] thinking because this is what I'm want
[6:35] us to think about is how Satan tricks us
[6:38] into selling our homes am he tricks us I
[6:43] how many of you have are are living in a
[6:45] house that's worth several hundred, and
[6:47] you get a letter in the mail saying
[6:48] we'll buy your house for
[6:50] $36,000 and it's as if we're going to be
[6:52] like okay cash offer let's do it and so
[6:57] that's and and you think it's crazy but
[6:59] guess what the devil lets us sell our
[7:01] homes for much less and so there's some
[7:05] extreme extremely practical principles
[7:08] in here for us to glean from as we use
[7:13] this for maybe dramatic effect you could
[7:15] call it clickbait I don't know if that's
[7:16] what brother Elliott called it but there
[7:19] there it might be just to get your
[7:20] attention but I want to get your
[7:22] attention with this Satan is looking to
[7:24] buy a home and are you in the
[7:27] market and think of some real practical
[7:30] things but first I want to lay a
[7:31] scriptural basis or some footing before
[7:33] I go further into our uh maybe the
[7:37] responsibilities of home life and how
[7:38] those things can be eroded but as we go
[7:40] forward let's just glean some practical
[7:42] ways to do better to build the house of
[7:45] the Lord individually as families and as
[7:46] a church so though I'm wanting to look
[7:48] into the scripture maybe use some
[7:50] doctrinal things and and a particular
[7:52] principle that we might say is a type on
[7:54] how Satan works and the way he's done
[7:56] things before uh we're do glean practice
[7:59] iCal principles by looking at a
[8:00] situation in the scripture say oh that's
[8:02] how Satan worked then I wonder if he
[8:04] works the same way today uh in a not in
[8:08] the same way he did on that scale but
[8:09] maybe in a smaller scale in my own life
[8:11] and so I want to draw
[8:13] inspiration from God's original home for
[8:16] mankind and that would be Eden that God
[8:19] created the heavens and the Earth and
[8:21] then he brought forth creation upon the
[8:23] Earth and then he and he establishes um
[8:26] Eden and then he begins to uh bring
[8:30] things forth and if I could say this and
[8:31] I want to read a couple statements from
[8:33] Christ as a mystery of God revealed Eden
[8:35] is a preview of God's ultimate home
[8:38] where God is resident with man and we've
[8:40] seen that image uh back and forth quite
[8:42] a bit through a number of different
[8:43] sermons brother baham says and Christ is
[8:45] the mystery of God revealed there's a
[8:47] number of statements I do not have on
[8:48] slides today because I want you to be
[8:50] listening uh as the Lord would lead you
[8:53] to listen and grab a hold of things and
[8:54] not so much reading he says watch
[8:57] Redeemed by Christ the second Adam going
[9:00] back home to Eden with his Fallen wife
[9:03] redeemed back home again so there's Eden
[9:06] is
[9:07] home there's something embodied in Eden
[9:10] that God created that is home that's
[9:11] Christ in the church today taking his
[9:13] wife back see the threefold mystery now
[9:17] God manifested in Christ Christ manifest
[9:19] in the church altto together to bring
[9:21] back the original Adam and Eve again man
[9:24] and woman which are one made out of the
[9:27] same blood and Same Spirit and
[9:28] everything else
[9:30] now in those principles that we should
[9:32] be familiar with how in Christ's mystery
[9:34] of God revealed how that that three-fold
[9:36] mystery of Christ God being revealed in
[9:39] Christ and how that relates to Christ
[9:42] the fullness in Christ Christ in his
[9:43] bride the third part going back to Eden
[9:47] it's it's phrased with home that's where
[9:50] home is going back home he says it this
[9:52] way making his mystery known to his
[9:53] bride tree Redeemed by Christ the second
[9:56] Adam going back home to be restored back
[9:59] to the original Eden free from Death
[10:01] sickness sorrow shame going back with
[10:04] eternal life so there's Eden represents
[10:07] home for us Eden represents something
[10:09] very precious to us something uh that
[10:12] what God was foreshadowing and
[10:14] expressing because when we talk about
[10:16] going back to Eden we're not time
[10:18] traveling back in a but what we're doing
[10:21] is we're traveling out of time back into
[10:22] eternity and remember God has promised
[10:25] us a future home not just a future house
[10:29] right right right so it's a home there's
[10:32] something about home brother brandham
[10:33] talks about God's future home and the
[10:36] future home of Christ and his bride and
[10:38] and when a man chooses a wife it speaks
[10:40] of his vision for home not the type of
[10:43] house he's going to build but the kind
[10:44] of home life he's going to have and so
[10:47] Eden represents and holds for us an
[10:51] image and a type of what home should be
[10:54] or how God wanted to structure home and
[10:56] it's it's just embodied in a lot of
[10:58] different details and elements but let's
[11:00] just turn to Genesis chapter 2: 8 I find
[11:03] myself always preaching from and drawing
[11:05] inspiration from the first three
[11:07] chapters of the
[11:10] Bible and it says and the Lord God
[11:13] planted a garden Eastward in
[11:15] Eden there he put the man whom he had
[11:18] formed so he places Adam in a home he he
[11:24] creates Eden then he plants a garden in
[11:27] Eden and there in the garden
[11:29] he puts the man he places him there and
[11:33] Eden was an extensive region it was not
[11:35] just it didn't just uh wasn't just the
[11:37] garden but it was this region of Great
[11:39] Beauty and great resources and uh and
[11:43] you know the planting and the soil and
[11:45] the the temperature everything just
[11:47] perfect and so this Eden was a pleasant
[11:50] place it was a great expanse of of uh
[11:54] just wealth and beauty and then God
[11:56] plants a garden this Garden is a happy
[11:59] Paradise for man and when he places man
[12:02] there he desires to essentially train
[12:05] the man God as the parent God as the
[12:08] father and with his parental care is
[12:11] going to bring Adam up and going to
[12:13] train him and equip him and place him
[12:16] and then for the purpose of handing off
[12:18] what he's created to Adam so God left
[12:21] this Legacy of his own creation to Adam
[12:24] which we see is what happens throughout
[12:26] the Old Testament we see over and over
[12:28] again that father's build the son is a
[12:30] builder of the family name and the
[12:32] father has an inheritance that or a
[12:35] kingdom that is inherited by the sun and
[12:38] it just keeps perpetually repeating
[12:39] itself and that was the idea that God
[12:41] had in the very beginning as he plants
[12:44] man in Eden Adam is under his parental
[12:47] care and it's beautiful to see how that
[12:49] God is going to work with Adam even
[12:51] before he brings the woman out of him
[12:54] because Adam's got to have a vision and
[12:56] a placing for his own life before he can
[12:58] bring the woman out of him and that she
[13:01] can have a place amen so God created a
[13:04] home in Eden and we know that he created
[13:06] it by the spoken word and it was
[13:09] governed and cultivated and protected by
[13:12] his spoken word amen in Isaiah chapter
[13:15] 32: 18 this scripture has has been one
[13:19] of our partner scriptures in this series
[13:20] and my people shall dwell in a Peaceable
[13:23] habitation and ured dwellings and in
[13:26] quiet resting places this home home in
[13:29] Eden is the first embodiment when it
[13:31] comes to mankind living and dwelling his
[13:34] first Peaceable habitation was the
[13:36] Garden in Eden God had made a home in
[13:39] Eden this was the Garden of God's
[13:41] delight and we even find in the Bible
[13:44] that God would come down in the cool of
[13:45] the day and walk with Adam it wasn't
[13:48] just a one-time occurrence as we reading
[13:50] in Genesis chapter 3 where that day God
[13:52] all of a sudden showed up but he came
[13:54] walking in the cool of the day as he
[13:56] often would have and God's presence
[13:58] amongst them so it's a garden of God's
[14:00] Delight it's a Peaceable habitation it
[14:02] was a sure dwelling it was a quiet
[14:05] resting place amen when brother brandham
[14:08] says that we're going back home to Eden
[14:09] we're reading scriptures that tell us
[14:11] this is God's framework this was God's
[14:13] foundation and his this was his home
[14:16] that we're going back to and we call it
[14:19] future
[14:20] home but then we know that mankind Falls
[14:23] and through sin and unbelief mankind is
[14:26] is going to leave this Garden
[14:29] and we know he doesn't leave the world
[14:31] he doesn't leave the Earth but he leaves
[14:33] something that was present on Earth in
[14:36] Genesis chapter 3: 23 to 24 and we
[14:39] touched on these things when we were
[14:41] preaching on the kingdom and um a lot of
[14:43] other different places where we've
[14:45] looked at this and when we go back over
[14:48] this I'm I'm not just wanting to repeat
[14:51] it so that we better understand Genesis
[14:53] chapter 3 and the repetition of these
[14:55] particular verses isn't so that we can
[14:57] have them memorized but to be making
[14:59] constant application of things that were
[15:01] written beforehand to our present lives
[15:03] in the hopes that God can Enlighten us
[15:06] to our present situation and his
[15:09] presence and so there's things that we
[15:11] can learn from these things says
[15:13] therefore God sent him forth from the
[15:15] Garden of
[15:17] Eden to till the ground from whence he
[15:20] was taken so he drove out the man and he
[15:23] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[15:26] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[15:28] turned every way to keep the way of the
[15:31] tree of life we could say this is Eden
[15:34] Lost Paradise Lost this is Adam and the
[15:37] woman at this point when God sent him
[15:40] forth from the garden so now as he
[15:42] leaves the garden he's still in Eden
[15:45] he's still in this he's still somewhat
[15:46] near uh to where the garden was but he's
[15:49] going to be kicked out of this uh Happy
[15:51] Paradise is now lost and Adam is kicked
[15:55] out and if I can say this Adam and the
[15:56] woman become homeless
[15:59] and I know that you say well that may be
[16:00] a little bit contrived but just bear
[16:01] with me Adam and the woman now are
[16:03] kicked out of their
[16:06] house of of of the garden kicked out of
[16:09] the home that was and now they find
[16:11] themselves in a very hostile world as
[16:14] God describes it in these prior verses
[16:17] but then God does something where he
[16:19] places cherubims with flaming
[16:21] swords east of the Garden of Eden so it
[16:25] it shows that there's a garden the
[16:27] angels are east of it man kind has been
[16:29] banished out of it it says to keep now
[16:32] think of this phrase to keep the way of
[16:34] the tree of life now when we think of
[16:38] the way of the tree of life I think our
[16:40] initial thought and it's not incorrect
[16:42] necessarily is that there would have
[16:43] there's like a road and now there's a
[16:45] toll booth and there used to be a road
[16:47] through there and now the bridge has
[16:48] been torn down but the way of the tree
[16:50] of life it's the tree of life so this is
[16:52] something Central to living this is
[16:55] something Central to life and it's not
[16:58] just a a path or a literal path but it's
[17:01] the correct path for Success it's the
[17:03] the right way to live it's the only way
[17:05] to have life so the way of the Tree of
[17:08] Life speaks of a a vision an
[17:10] understanding of life it speaks of real
[17:12] living and it is something Central to
[17:15] True success the Bible says in Proverbs
[17:18] chap 22:6 train up a child in the way he
[17:21] should go and when he is old he'll not
[17:23] Depart of it depart from it so when it
[17:26] says the way of the tree of life it's
[17:27] more than a path but way of life a
[17:30] manner of living that keep the way of
[17:32] the tree of life it's not just a road
[17:34] but it is a way of life and now when it
[17:37] says that they have been kicked out of
[17:38] the garden and there's Cher bums there
[17:41] to keep the way of life in other words
[17:43] there's a way to live that cannot be
[17:46] corrupted there's a right kind of living
[17:49] that is now going to be kept but in
[17:51] being kept it's not necessarily easily
[17:53] accessible by mankind or even understood
[17:55] by mankind so how I want to basically
[17:57] say this is there has has been a change
[18:00] in the way of life that in the Garden of
[18:04] Eden there was a way of life and even
[18:06] though mankind had not partaken of the
[18:07] tree of life now God says he can't
[18:10] because there's no living he can't eat
[18:12] that and live as I want him to uh in his
[18:15] current condition so he's going to keep
[18:17] the right way to live and it's hidden
[18:19] it's a mystery it can only come one way
[18:23] well there's a lot that can be expressed
[18:24] in that but so there's now when mankind
[18:27] leaves the garden his way of life
[18:30] changes not going to live the same way
[18:32] he was living
[18:33] before and I I hope that's a principle
[18:36] that we could kind of grab on to and be
[18:38] a little bit
[18:39] sticky now in Genesis 4: 16-1
[18:45] 17 this is the way of life
[18:49] after the garden and even especially
[18:53] with this hybrid nature and Cain went
[18:55] out from the presence of the Lord and
[18:56] dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of
[18:59] Eden so we could see that his pride and
[19:02] his sin are driving him further away
[19:05] from God and further away from the way
[19:08] of the tree of life just and the way the
[19:11] scriptures describing it is there was a
[19:13] way of the Tree of Life there was a
[19:14] manner of living there was a condition a
[19:16] joy a happiness a pleasantness in the
[19:19] garden and when man sins he's left the
[19:22] way of the Tree of Life And now when
[19:25] Cain goes further he's getting further
[19:28] away of the way of the tree of life so
[19:31] he's still living but his manner of life
[19:33] is very different than the manner of
[19:35] life that we ought to have had or could
[19:36] have had if we in his presence or
[19:39] seeking his presence so Cain is running
[19:41] away whereas we could see the sons of
[19:43] Seth are essentially beholding Eden
[19:46] looking at the way of the garden and
[19:48] calling on the name of the Lord and
[19:50] identifying themselves with the way of
[19:52] the tree of life even though they can't
[19:53] partake in
[19:55] it I hope that I hope that I can paint
[19:58] the picture today and in in a way that
[20:01] God or I hope God can paint the picture
[20:03] to you and if he has to use my words as
[20:06] a brush may his Spirit just be the color
[20:08] to to help this be very Vivid to
[20:11] you so Cain's going further away from
[20:14] the right kind of living he's going
[20:15] further away from what the Garden in
[20:17] Eden represented and it says and Cain
[20:19] knew his wife and she conceived and bear
[20:21] Enoch and he build it a city and called
[20:24] the name of the city after the name of
[20:26] his son Enoch now in looking at
[20:33] this looking at this
[20:35] before we saw how that this
[20:38] city the even the word that's being used
[20:41] here it was it's a a city is a place not
[20:45] just a Dwelling Place not just an
[20:46] encampment but it had these
[20:48] characteristics to where it was always
[20:51] uh it was always on guard in a
[20:53] wake it was a place guarded by waking or
[20:56] by a watch so when Cain built the city
[21:00] it wasn't uh Without Walls and and just
[21:02] anyone who wanted to come and there was
[21:05] peace and there was rest and there was
[21:06] kind of this uh security and just
[21:09] believing we all we're all related we're
[21:11] all family and whenever someone says
[21:12] we're all family we all go but there's
[21:15] uh it was just this idea of everyone
[21:17] being being together it didn't exist so
[21:21] he had to build up walls why because of
[21:23] fear and so because of tear and because
[21:26] of fear he wanted to protect him himself
[21:29] and he wanted to protect his family and
[21:31] he was afraid of consequences and so he
[21:33] had to build a city to kind of give
[21:35] himself some security so without rest
[21:38] and joy he was now scheming ways to
[21:41] bring happiness to bring quietness to
[21:44] bring security and if I could say this
[21:46] to kind of quiet his
[21:48] fear he's getting further away from the
[21:50] manner the way of living and in order to
[21:52] make himself feel better about himself
[21:55] and to save himself from himself and to
[21:57] quiet his fears because this is his way
[21:59] of trying to come up with a Peaceable
[22:00] habitation ass sure dwelling a quiet
[22:02] resting place let's build a fortified
[22:04] place with watch and guards so we can
[22:06] kind of go ah rest at night so this was
[22:10] his own ways of trying to scheme
[22:12] happiness and and and this is Mankind's
[22:16] uh Instinct after the fall when he's
[22:18] gotten away from the garden when he's
[22:20] when now that he's homeless he's got to
[22:22] figure out a way to encamp himself to
[22:24] protect protect what he has and to fend
[22:27] for what he wants
[22:30] now that's in the image of Cain it's
[22:32] going to be important to come back to
[22:34] that here in a little bit if I could say
[22:36] this the world was no longer Adam's
[22:39] home when you begin to see that there's
[22:41] cities being dwelt and there's fear
[22:43] that's coming upon Mankind and there's
[22:45] this division h a and there's a
[22:48] differences in visions and and
[22:52] intent the world is no longer Adam's
[22:54] home despite the fact that he still
[22:57] lived in it
[22:59] so when Adam and the woman sinned it
[23:01] wasn't that they all of a sudden just
[23:02] started floating in space and now
[23:04] they've been come untethered from the
[23:05] earth and now they don't they need to
[23:07] you know they float to another planet
[23:09] that they can house themselves on they
[23:11] still live in the place that they were
[23:13] from they still lived in the the world
[23:15] that one that we were given dominion
[23:16] over they are there living in a house
[23:20] but again this is just my the benefit of
[23:23] repetition for myself they still didn't
[23:25] have a
[23:27] home now we could skip all the way ahead
[23:29] to Revelations chapter 5 and this is
[23:32] like a real leap this is going really
[23:36] really
[23:37] far a Quantum Leap would have been to go
[23:40] to verse 18 in Genesis 4 but this one is
[23:43] a real big leap Revelations 5: 7-10
[23:47] we're now looking at God addressing the
[23:50] fact that Adam is homeless not just Adam
[23:53] but us mankind
[23:55] humanity and the scene is Before the
[23:58] Throne of of God and he has a book in
[24:00] his hand which is sealed with Seven
[24:02] Seals and verse 7even speaks of the Lion
[24:05] of the tribe of Judah who was as a lamb
[24:07] he came and took the book out of the
[24:09] right hand of him that sat upon the
[24:11] throne and when he had taken the book
[24:14] The the four Beast and the four and 20
[24:16] Elders fell down before the
[24:19] lamb having every one of them
[24:22] Harps and golden vials full of odors
[24:25] which are the prayers of
[24:27] saints as soon as the book is in the
[24:29] hands of
[24:32] Christ the four beasts and the four
[24:34] and20 Elders are immediately reacting to
[24:37] it and then upon this physical
[24:41] reaction of of themselves where they
[24:45] they they they fall down and then now as
[24:48] they have fallen they're going to raise
[24:49] their voices and they sung a new song
[24:52] now this is new this is there's a
[24:54] newness to it saying Thou Art Worthy to
[24:56] take the book and to open the seals
[24:57] thereof now that's the event that
[25:00] prompts the falling down and the lifting
[25:02] up of this new song and this is the
[25:06] effect or this is more descriptions of
[25:08] him for thou was slain and now the
[25:10] effect and Hast redeemed us to God by
[25:13] thy blood out of every Kindred and
[25:15] tongue and people and Nation that's the
[25:17] effect of the sacrifice of the Lamb so
[25:21] as it's describing more what he has done
[25:23] now the full impact of the book being
[25:26] taken and the seals being loosed and
[25:29] Hast made us under our God Kings and
[25:32] Priests and notice this and we shall
[25:35] reign on the
[25:37] earth that's that phrase that the I
[25:41] thought the Lord directed me to that
[25:42] when you look at Adam as king and as
[25:45] ruler of the whole earth given Dominion
[25:47] power over everything he loses that
[25:49] through the fall and from that moment
[25:51] there has never been a king like that
[25:55] over the whole earth never been one that
[25:58] could say I'm rightful this is mine I'm
[26:01] I have dominion there's none that had
[26:03] that full Authority and power as a as a
[26:06] man a man from that time but now after
[26:09] the seals are open and the events that
[26:12] unfold there under and the things that
[26:13] are loose there under it says we shall
[26:15] reign on the
[26:17] earth Reign on Earth not it says as
[26:20] Kings and Priests not as mortal Kings
[26:24] have reigned in the past because they
[26:25] could say uh King James could say well
[26:28] I've I'm not talking about LeBron I'm
[26:29] talking about King James could say i'
[26:31] I've I reigned on our Earth I was a king
[26:34] and this King I've reigned and and they
[26:36] could all say rained on Earth say well
[26:37] technically yes that's true but not like
[26:41] this they shall reign on the earth in
[26:44] full possession with full legal
[26:47] Authority not just a title that they're
[26:51] a king and not just some subplot not
[26:54] just loyal followers but there would be
[26:56] this is if I could say this this
[26:59] is this is home coming back to
[27:03] Earth Earth becoming a home
[27:06] again when mankind fell God so God
[27:11] is God has the parent has a son creates
[27:15] a son Adam and he says I give this to
[27:18] you but when he deed it to Adam there
[27:20] was a c there was a claw in there that
[27:24] if he did something that he was going to
[27:26] lose right that there there was a clause
[27:29] in the deed there was this restrictive
[27:31] covenant in what did he given uh it was
[27:33] we know that it was a conditional
[27:35] Covenant and so when we think in terms
[27:37] of uh the disposition of property or
[27:41] bequeathing this to Adam there there was
[27:43] something in there that could
[27:46] undo the inheritance and so when Adam
[27:49] lost it follow me this is an important
[27:52] part when Adam lost his kingship in full
[27:56] ownership over the Earth
[27:58] he couldn't give it to
[28:01] Satan the the title the right the power
[28:05] the legal ownership of Eden the legal
[28:07] ownership of the earth went back to
[28:09] God so Adam forfeited his right in
[28:13] ownership according to the word of God
[28:16] back to God the Creator the original
[28:18] owner when he
[28:20] fell and once this happens Adam doesn't
[28:24] he's not evicted from the earth he's
[28:26] evicted from the garden right but he
[28:28] still remains with a promise and certain
[28:31] covenants on the earth with the Earth as
[28:34] a house but it had lost its Heavenly
[28:36] character and Mankind no longer had if I
[28:40] could say it this way he no longer had
[28:42] the full title and authority over the
[28:47] world and this is what's happened in
[28:49] Revelations chapter 5 when the response
[28:52] of the 420 Elders is we're going to rain
[28:54] on the earth they're realizing now
[28:57] they're being brought got back to a a
[28:59] position that Christ foreshadowed when
[29:02] he was on Earth because he controlled
[29:05] everything he was showing that what Adam
[29:07] lost in the fall was being restored back
[29:09] to
[29:11] Mankind and that's why Satan tries to
[29:13] preempt it by saying I'll give you the
[29:15] kingdoms I'll give them to
[29:17] you because he wanted him to do it
[29:20] without actual
[29:24] title Revelations chapter 5 part two if
[29:27] I can this Adam paid the price and lost
[29:31] it so Christ needed to pay the price to
[29:33] get it back so now looking at these
[29:36] verses here in Revelations chapter 5
[29:37] part two our Kinsman is handed the seven
[29:39] sealed book of redemption oh good I got
[29:41] this one here from the original owner
[29:43] when we lost it in the Garden of Eden
[29:45] through Adam it went back to the
[29:47] original owner that's plain brother
[29:50] brand when he's preaching uh the this
[29:52] the church ages he's preaching these
[29:53] things in 1961 our Kinsman is handed the
[29:57] seven sealed book of redemption from God
[29:59] so God had it that's who had it but it
[30:03] went back into the hands of God after
[30:05] Adam lost it so when Adam held was on
[30:08] Earth God said Adam you are God on Earth
[30:12] the Earth is Yours just as the heavens
[30:14] are mine just as Heaven is mine so Adam
[30:17] has it and just by way of dramatization
[30:20] when Adam sinned God came back and when
[30:22] he's banishing him out of the garden
[30:24] he's saying Adam I need the deed back I
[30:28] I I you need to give me all that back
[30:29] what I told you the day you eat you're
[30:32] going to Forfeit certain rights give it
[30:34] back to
[30:36] me and again I'm just dramatizing maybe
[30:38] the devil's thinking wait a
[30:41] minute I I I seduced I wanted to I
[30:45] wanted to get access to that I wanted to
[30:48] own that but it goes back into the hands
[30:51] of the of the original
[30:53] owner and so Satan cannot get to it
[30:57] though I believe he wanted it and he was
[30:59] after
[31:00] it and so there's something that um he
[31:03] misses out on but stay with this now
[31:06] because notice what he
[31:08] says he says but there's been a poacher
[31:11] on the
[31:12] land a squatter and that's
[31:16] Satan he's come over he's a poacher the
[31:19] Earth don't belong to him belongs to God
[31:24] but he's a poacher a squatter he goes
[31:26] man I how I could say say something
[31:28] right now but I better
[31:32] not man I wish you would have said
[31:35] it it might have had something to do
[31:37] with squatters a squatter is one who
[31:39] unlawfully inhabits a land or dwelling
[31:43] one who occupies a squatter is one who
[31:45] occupies without legal
[31:48] title it's used in reference reference
[31:51] to homeless
[31:52] people who inhabit buildings they don't
[31:55] own or structures they don't own and
[31:57] that's why by a place when one it
[31:59] doesn't own something and they live
[32:02] there they're squatting and where they
[32:04] live is called a squatted it's just kind
[32:06] of legal terms there I'm being serious
[32:08] it's called a squage not a cottage maybe
[32:12] if you say it fast enough people think
[32:13] you live in a cottage oh we got a nice
[32:14] squage in the The Hamptons this year I
[32:18] think a cottage in the Hamptons that's
[32:21] nice the Earth didn't belong to him it
[32:23] belonged to God but now he's a poacher a
[32:26] squatter he said is the title deed of
[32:29] our Redemption this seven sealed
[32:31] book it's the title deed when we go back
[32:34] to Revelations 5 we're dealing with in
[32:36] type title deed and transfer of
[32:38] ownership and rightful title you wait
[32:40] till we get into those seals he breaks
[32:41] the seals reveals gives us his
[32:44] inheritance to his people he gives the
[32:46] inheritance that he inherited becoming
[32:48] the kinsman redeemer and freely gives it
[32:50] out to us it all belonged to him he was
[32:53] the one who redeemed but instead of
[32:56] keeping in himself he gives it back back
[32:58] to the
[32:59] people that's his love for
[33:02] us I I hope that we can draw in type
[33:06] that if one day this world that became
[33:08] the domain a a a squage for the devil
[33:13] because man had lost his full title
[33:15] right and Authority in other words the
[33:17] devil was there squatting and we like
[33:19] well devil you don't belong here you
[33:20] shouldn't be doing this he's like prove
[33:21] it to me you like
[33:23] well there's Cloud on title I I can't
[33:25] really exactly uh uh uh I don't know how
[33:28] to enforce my claim I don't know how to
[33:30] prove it but now at the open of the
[33:32] seals and this book coming into the
[33:34] hands of our kinsman redeemer he's
[33:36] wanting to give it out to us so that we
[33:39] can understand that this entire Creation
[33:42] in world was made for us it's our legal
[33:46] right and possession and if that is so
[33:49] of it all how much more of my individual
[33:52] life my family and our church
[33:56] amen that's his love for us and then he
[33:58] says oh Satan the possessor of it now
[34:03] the
[34:04] squatter so he's a possessor of it now
[34:07] just a possessor and I know people think
[34:08] nine1 of the law is possession and I
[34:11] still don't even really know what that
[34:12] means
[34:13] necessarily but it's you I think in
[34:16] other words it conveys the idea that if
[34:18] somebody has something the law is on
[34:20] their side most
[34:21] likely that that's going to be that's a
[34:24] hard thing to
[34:26] rebut and so when brother brandham calls
[34:28] the devil a
[34:30] squatter he's living somewhere that he
[34:32] doesn't
[34:33] own and he makes reference to title deed
[34:36] he makes reference to abstract he makes
[34:38] reference to deed and you'll find in
[34:40] legal terms they're all different things
[34:44] and but yet at the end of the day
[34:45] they're all for the purpose of
[34:47] identifying who's the rightful owner or
[34:49] to convey ownership and here in the way
[34:52] that he describes it he's saying this is
[34:54] the title
[34:55] deed given to his
[34:58] people so a a title deed is a legal deed
[35:01] it's a legal document which constitutes
[35:05] the evidence of the right of
[35:07] ownership so the title deed is not just
[35:10] going to say God on it if he's conveying
[35:13] it to us as an inheritance that's going
[35:16] to have your name on it you are going to
[35:19] be on that title deed as the one who has
[35:22] a lawful right to inhabit and to
[35:24] possess full right and authority over it
[35:28] when the deed went into the hands of
[35:30] Adam there was a restrictive covenant
[35:32] that unless he used it for these
[35:34] purposes he the ownership had to revert
[35:36] back to God anybody familiar with these
[35:38] terminologies in actual real estate law
[35:40] brother John of course and that there's
[35:42] ideas where you can sell somebody land
[35:45] and you can say uh Elliott you can use
[35:48] this for as long as you want for a house
[35:51] but as soon as you turn it into a hockey
[35:54] arena ownership reverts back to me and
[35:58] those are true restrictive covenants I
[36:00] think Phoenix is probably looking for a
[36:02] new hockey team now but there's ways
[36:04] that you can make sure that something
[36:06] never happens on that land and it's
[36:08] legal to do it such that if something
[36:10] happens boom it goes right it's deed
[36:12] restrictions boom goes right back uh
[36:15] there's some sort of reversion of what's
[36:17] taking place and unwinding of the
[36:18] transaction or there's another
[36:19] conveyance to the estate or the those
[36:21] that would be the rightful heirs so the
[36:24] title deed brother B is saying is this
[36:27] legal Authority it constitutes evidence
[36:30] of the right of
[36:32] ownership but Satan right now has
[36:35] possession but what he doesn't have is a
[36:38] title what he doesn't have is any deed
[36:41] evidencing a
[36:43] right he can't produce a title that he
[36:45] owns it and in the absence of a a title
[36:48] because you could have a title it says
[36:50] well there's
[36:51] no my name's not on the title but here's
[36:54] a deed where the person who's on the
[36:55] titles conveyed it to me right right
[36:58] there's different orders of preferences
[37:00] that if and you got to know what what it
[37:02] is in the state you live in cuz somebody
[37:03] could sell you a property and then sell
[37:05] it to somebody else and whoever gets
[37:06] there first and files is the one that
[37:08] owns it and so the title could show a
[37:11] name you could have a deed that shows
[37:13] your name and the name on the title has
[37:16] deeded it to you and say I have a deed
[37:18] and that needs to be filed right that
[37:21] would need to be filed to show that the
[37:23] one who had proper title has now
[37:25] conveyed it to you
[37:27] you didn't know you were going to get
[37:29] your CL or your real estate agent
[37:31] license credits for the year and let's
[37:34] all go take our test
[37:35] later there's a lot in here that you can
[37:38] draw from but Satan has possession but
[37:41] the title doesn't have his name on it
[37:43] and he can't show you any deed anywhere
[37:45] where he got it Revelations 20: 1 to5
[37:49] now says and I saw an angel come down
[37:53] that's verse one there though I missed
[37:55] the one and I saw an angel come down
[37:56] from heaven having the key of the
[37:58] bottomless pit and a great chain in his
[38:00] hand and he laid hold on the dragon that
[38:03] old serpent which is the devil in Satan
[38:06] this sounds like it was written by a
[38:08] lawyer you want to properly identify the
[38:11] party right you don't want there to be
[38:14] any ambiguity as to who is going who's
[38:17] going to be be dispossessed you want to
[38:19] be able to know with clear sufficiency
[38:22] and establish the burden of proof that
[38:24] he's the one he's the one this is
[38:27] happening to and bound him a thousand
[38:30] years this is the
[38:31] squatter the world is no longer his
[38:34] squage he the poacher has been kicked
[38:37] off and cast him into a bottomless pit
[38:39] and shut him up and set a seal upon him
[38:43] that he should not that he should
[38:44] deceive the Nations no more till the
[38:46] Thousand Years should be fulfilled and
[38:48] after that he must be loosed a little
[38:50] season but now the squatter is
[38:52] dispossessed he's taken away he's been
[38:54] removed he's been
[38:56] banished and and this is different than
[38:59] when Adam left too if we could think
[39:00] about that and I saw Thrones and they
[39:02] sat upon them and judgment was given
[39:05] unto them and I saw the souls of them
[39:06] that were beheaded for the witness of
[39:07] Jesus and for the word of God and which
[39:09] had not worshiped the Beast neither his
[39:10] image neither had received his Mark upon
[39:12] their foreheads are in their hands and
[39:15] they lived and reigned with Christ a
[39:17] thousand
[39:18] years now this is that symmetry to
[39:20] Revelations chapter 5 now Christ the
[39:23] squatter is gone now we live and rain on
[39:28] Earth in a Peaceable habitation without
[39:32] the threat of an enemy in a sure
[39:34] dwelling and quiet resting places
[39:36] because the squatter the deceiver the
[39:38] enemy has been
[39:41] dispossessed and the rest of the Dead
[39:44] live not again until the thousand years
[39:45] were finished this is the first
[39:48] resurrection this is taking back full
[39:53] possession in Revelations chapter 5 part
[39:56] two again brother Bram says Satan is a
[39:59] squatter he don't legally own this and
[40:02] he's had 2,000 years of fuss whether he
[40:04] owns it or somebody else owns
[40:06] it but Christ came as the kinsman
[40:08] redeemer and redeemed it back to us are
[40:11] you are you able to kind of enter into
[40:13] Fellowship around the reality of the
[40:16] world being something that God created
[40:18] that he wanted us to have and fully to
[40:22] possess fully and it was the the the
[40:24] legal possession and rulership and
[40:26] ownership and full authority of it was
[40:28] lost but that power didn't necessarily
[40:31] wasn't necessarily stolen and assumed by
[40:34] Satan he could Forge AED all he wants
[40:36] and he could fabricate all sorts of
[40:37] paperwork and create thousands of
[40:39] denominations to try to prove it but the
[40:41] reality is God has it but God all along
[40:45] Redemption was to give it back to
[40:48] us not that it would forever be Satan's
[40:52] or forever ruled by sin but God had
[40:55] legal title passed back to him he was
[40:57] proactive he knew what was going to
[40:59] happen so he structured it such a way
[41:00] that Adam the day you sin is the day
[41:02] that the devil owns the
[41:04] world it was no that day happens there's
[41:07] things you lose but God was not going to
[41:09] lose the
[41:11] world and he redeems it back to
[41:16] us but Satan possesses
[41:19] it but you know after a while this great
[41:22] fight's over he'll be cast into the Lake
[41:24] of Fire he'll be done away with and all
[41:25] them who worships with him but the SS of
[41:28] Salvation will come with
[41:29] Christ that's gonna come and he says now
[41:32] he's a
[41:34] squatter we got a new name for the devil
[41:36] you
[41:38] squatter it's what he
[41:42] is don't let him make your heart a
[41:47] squage don't him don't don't him don't
[41:51] him let don't let
[41:54] him turn your house into his squaded
[41:59] and God forbid that he would ever turn
[42:00] our
[42:01] church into a
[42:05] squage in 2 Corinthians chapter 4:4 in
[42:08] light of the fact that he's a poacher
[42:09] and a squatter what has he been able to
[42:12] do Paul even says this of the devil in
[42:15] whom the God of this world hath blinded
[42:18] the minds of them which believe not lest
[42:20] the light of the Glorious gospel of
[42:22] Christ who is in the image of God should
[42:23] shine unto them I know that it's worthy
[42:25] to focus on how he has blinded the minds
[42:28] of them that don't believe uh unless the
[42:31] because if they don't believe then the
[42:32] light can't shine in Christ who is in
[42:35] the image of God cannot have the Impact
[42:37] deep within the soul so he wants to put
[42:38] up these barriers he wants to Blind the
[42:40] eyes but notice don't gloss over this
[42:43] this is where brother b gets the God of
[42:45] this evil age from and whom the God of
[42:47] this world there's an actual phrasing to
[42:51] where the God of this world where Satan
[42:53] has made this world his own yes now
[42:57] despite the fact that the literal Earth
[42:59] and the literal world and all that is in
[43:01] it he doesn't have he doesn't have
[43:02] creative power over and nor did he have
[43:05] legal title over it but he's made it his
[43:08] own to where it's now called Satan's
[43:12] Eden on and located in an atmosphere and
[43:16] on a ground that are spoken word
[43:18] attributes of God he has been able to
[43:21] establish Satan's Eden he has made it in
[43:23] other words in a perverted sense his
[43:26] home right brother B teaches us that
[43:29] God's Eden was established in
[43:30] righteousness and Satan's Eden is
[43:32] established in sin and that's where he's
[43:35] at
[43:36] home it says in Revelations 17: 18 and
[43:39] the woman which thou sawest in that
[43:41] great city which reth over the kings of
[43:44] the
[43:45] earth so here is this image of Babylon
[43:48] and this cruel woman beautiful but yet
[43:49] cruel and and all the images that uh
[43:52] associate with Babylon in that Kingdom
[43:55] of the world it says it Reigns over the
[43:58] kings of the earth so he through the
[44:00] woman and through
[44:02] Babylon Reigns over the
[44:06] kings of the Earth but not over the
[44:10] Earth in the same way that we would rule
[44:14] he has to rule by
[44:16] proxy he has to rule by controlling all
[44:19] these little things and the Kings
[44:21] themselves are not the rulers they're
[44:22] being uh reigned and ruled over by sin
[44:25] and by unbelief and by demonic powers at
[44:27] the allowance of God to fulfill his
[44:29] perfect will but this woman Reigns over
[44:32] the kings of the earth not she could not
[44:35] actually Reign Over the Earth in the
[44:37] same way that we are made Kings and
[44:39] Priests to Reign Over the earth and the
[44:41] way that we will in that thousand years
[44:43] to reign with Christ a thousand years
[44:45] it's not the same thing it would be
[44:47] foolish to equate what they do on Earth
[44:49] today as mortal Kings and as these kings
[44:52] that the woman Reigns over on the earth
[44:55] because he cannot truly Reign on Earth
[44:59] because it's not his
[45:01] right he reigns over the Kings but he's
[45:03] a squatter on the
[45:06] earth now
[45:09] that's that
[45:11] is uh this is a junction point and I'm
[45:14] probably right at that point where I
[45:16] could stop and make some
[45:17] fans that's not my side gig in other
[45:20] words get some people on my side Paul
[45:23] was a Tent Maker brother Aaron makes
[45:25] fans
[45:30] but the question then is this because
[45:32] that I this is way this is the way it
[45:34] works in my mind so now as we've gotten
[45:37] to this point I hope we can see this
[45:38] picture of the garden is home in Eden
[45:42] man has full right title and possession
[45:44] of the whole thing and the garden is
[45:47] especially his home God visits there
[45:49] it's a beautiful place then through sin
[45:54] the title of the whole world and home is
[45:57] lost by Adam great channels become
[46:00] clogged he's pushed out of the garden he
[46:03] now lives in the world and the the way
[46:06] the world has gone is it's got more
[46:07] worldly more sinful more sinful why
[46:09] because God took 6,000 years to make his
[46:11] Eden and to place man there Satan ever
[46:14] since then has been building his home
[46:16] building his Eden but he does it without
[46:18] full right legal possession he's a
[46:20] squatter so he's turned the world which
[46:23] is Adam's house now but should have been
[46:25] his home he's turned it into his own
[46:26] home
[46:27] home and so as we went further into the
[46:30] time we're living in now Revelations
[46:31] chap 3 the L to seen age would perfectly
[46:33] encapsulate this was drawn to it but I
[46:35] realize there's a lot of repetition in
[46:37] that for us then we've already looked
[46:39] forward to the time when possession is
[46:42] taken away from Satan he's thrown in
[46:45] jail and therefore we whose names are on
[46:48] the title not by proxy but full legal
[46:51] right and authority to the Earth we will
[46:53] reign over the Earth forever amen
[46:55] especially in that thousand year period
[46:57] and the condition that it'll be in just
[46:58] to demonstrate uh that possession and
[47:01] full right and title so I'm going to
[47:04] back up how did
[47:07] Adam go from house and home to housed
[47:10] and
[47:12] homeless how how did this happen why did
[47:16] this happen it's important to look at
[47:18] this because after all we're driving
[47:20] this point home for ourselves
[47:22] individually as families and as a church
[47:24] and how that we can be housed but not
[47:26] really be in the perfect will of God in
[47:28] 1 Peter 5: 6-1 let's look at as the
[47:32] Bible said the dragon the serpent the
[47:34] devil Satan in legal terms sufficiently
[47:37] identifying by his meats and Bounds and
[47:38] physical description we for sure that
[47:40] we've identified the squatter the
[47:43] poacher he says humble yourselves
[47:45] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[47:47] that he may exalt you in due
[47:49] time casting all your care upon him for
[47:54] he carth for
[47:55] you beautiful words humble yourselves
[47:58] under the mighty hand of God so key
[48:02] submit yourselves therefore to God
[48:04] resist the devil and he'll
[48:07] flee resistance without submission is
[48:09] futile if you don't submit to God your
[48:12] resistance will give up so first humble
[48:15] yourselves that you may be exalted cast
[48:18] your cares your anxieties unburden
[48:19] yourself he
[48:21] cares be sober be vigilant now this is
[48:24] our responsibility we are to Humble
[48:25] ourselves and cast our cares upon him so
[48:28] he's got to give us the mighty hand to
[48:30] Humble ourselves too we got to cast our
[48:32] cares upon Him and Trust to him and now
[48:34] we have to be V sober be vigilant
[48:36] there's a lot of amplification we can
[48:37] give to that but why because your
[48:39] adversary your enemy the squatter the
[48:42] poacher the devil as a roaring lion
[48:44] walketh about seeking whom he may
[48:47] devour if I could say this drawing from
[48:49] the knowledge that you have in the
[48:50] scripture thou Hast been in the Garden
[48:53] of Eden Satan was in the garden looking
[48:54] for a house to make a home right that's
[48:58] what Satan was doing he is a he is
[49:00] always looking always seeking always
[49:04] wanting to take advantage your adversary
[49:06] the devil is
[49:08] always working an
[49:11] angle he's walking about seeking whom he
[49:14] may
[49:15] devour he's wanting to consume he's
[49:17] wanting to take up he was on Earth
[49:20] looking for life he was on Earth looking
[49:22] to create he was on Earth looking for
[49:25] access to possess
[49:28] I I'm forgetting the name of the book
[49:30] now but I read a book I don't know if I
[49:32] should say it but I read a
[49:34] book The only reason I don't want to say
[49:36] it is because I believe that they made
[49:37] it into a movie and I wouldn't want
[49:38] anyone to try to go out and watch the
[49:40] movie a number of years ago I read an
[49:42] excellent book and now I'm going to have
[49:44] to change the names and change the
[49:46] places and in a very small country in
[49:50] Eastern Europe there was these tribes
[49:53] that had been dispossessed of their
[49:55] land and put in uh uh land which was not
[50:00] farmable and you couldn't it was just
[50:01] Rocky hard rough land and so these these
[50:05] these bands of people were put on this
[50:06] land that the the rulers of that day
[50:09] felt were
[50:11] insignificant well they discovered gold
[50:13] in them Hills
[50:14] essentially and now all of a sudden that
[50:16] land became very very valuable and this
[50:18] demeaned belittle tribe now became the
[50:21] richest people in the land because of
[50:24] the gold they owned in the land but
[50:25] being the biggest they were and those
[50:27] Eastern Europeans is they didn't think
[50:29] these minorities were smart enough to
[50:32] manage their Affairs so they were given
[50:34] trustees over their land to manage their
[50:37] finances and to manage their money and
[50:40] so one man came up with the
[50:42] idea that because all these families
[50:44] owned all these different plots with the
[50:46] gold in it and this man had the idea
[50:48] that if he could get his nephew if I
[50:51] remember correctly to marry one of these
[50:53] tribal
[50:54] women and he could systemat atically
[50:57] kill all of her heirs that eventually
[50:59] all the gold would be owned by his
[51:01] nephew why because where was I going
[51:04] with
[51:05] this this doesn't even make any sense
[51:07] anymore you know Cisco and Ebert gave it
[51:09] two thumbs
[51:14] up I'm having to look at where I
[51:18] was in other words this guy was like a
[51:20] roaring lion
[51:22] right and he was conspiring ways that he
[51:25] could get ownership and
[51:27] possession by Murder By Deceit by all
[51:30] sorts of means in a way that he could uh
[51:33] he could uh accumulate wealth because he
[51:35] wanted the greed was behind it and and
[51:38] and there was no there was nothing uh
[51:41] beneath him he was willing to do
[51:42] whatever it would took in order to kill
[51:44] and to murder entire families so that he
[51:46] could consolidate all the wealth and all
[51:48] the possessions into his hands and if it
[51:50] doesn't read like Satan's script I don't
[51:52] know what does it's exactly what Satan
[51:55] thought he could do in the beginning by
[51:56] getting to the woman he thought he could
[51:58] get to the man and by access to her he
[52:00] was hoping to be able to get access to
[52:02] all of it so it could be his and he
[52:05] could rule and Reign isn't that what he
[52:06] desired I want to exalt myself above I
[52:09] want to be the title holder I want full
[52:11] legal Authority I want to be
[52:14] God and so it's still Satan's ambition
[52:16] today as it was then he was in the
[52:19] garden looking for a house to make his
[52:22] own brother brandham says in Satan's
[52:24] Eden it's been and now is Satan esta
[52:26] lishing his kingdom in Earth that's
[52:28] exactly why he's doing it he wants to
[52:30] establish his own
[52:33] kingdom read this now as a businessman
[52:37] that's not a
[52:39] Christian he'll work every scheme he can
[52:42] to make you see something the wrong
[52:44] way let's not be too theological let's
[52:47] think daily
[52:49] living in every single way and I know it
[52:52] puts us on guard and we could be like
[52:54] well what's the use anyhow it's just all
[52:55] one big sh
[52:57] well it's not a bad idea to have some
[52:58] healthy skepticism but all the things
[53:01] the devil floats to us and the world
[53:02] floats to us and these things that are
[53:04] presented to us because he's working
[53:05] every scheme he can to make you see
[53:07] something the wrong way if he's got a
[53:08] person and a purpose and personal gain
[53:10] and making you doing that make you
[53:13] seeing it that way he'll show you
[53:16] everything he can and keep you off from
[53:18] the truth of it because he's got a
[53:20] feeling only for himself no matter how
[53:22] much he lies and cheats and whatever
[53:25] more he's got personal
[53:30] gain Satan has a business card it says I
[53:32] buy
[53:33] homes and he's going to knock on your
[53:36] door and he's going to try to work a
[53:38] deal and he'll use every scheme he can
[53:42] he'll lie he'll cheat he'll present
[53:45] things to you he'll show things to you
[53:47] manipulate control can contrive be
[53:50] religious you name he's going to do
[53:51] everything he can in a way to get you to
[53:55] sell the Bible says in 2 Corinthians
[53:57] chap 11: 14 and 15 I need to go quickly
[54:00] now it's 11:30 and I really uh um I I I
[54:05] think I might just close where we are
[54:07] stopping very very short of where I want
[54:09] to
[54:10] be but I want to do it in a way that's
[54:12] uh beneficial to you so remember that I
[54:15] wanted to expand more but Satan is a
[54:17] businessman who's in business to
[54:20] transact and and even when you're the
[54:22] one buying something or even when he's
[54:24] the one buying he's the one
[54:27] selling he he's got to sell you
[54:29] something first to get you uh to get you
[54:32] to sell to
[54:35] him is what the woman in the beginning
[54:38] this is what happened it says Satan
[54:39] himself was transformed into an angel of
[54:41] Light therefore it is no great thing if
[54:43] his ministers also be transformed as the
[54:44] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[54:46] shall be according to their works the
[54:49] appearance is a
[54:51] disguise his appearance is a disguise
[54:54] with the intent to deceive with the
[54:56] intent to lead astray he's got personal
[54:59] gain he's selling and he's also buying
[55:02] he's transacting for his own good you
[55:05] should ask yourself in any given
[55:06] situation when somebody offers you
[55:09] something or offers you something or is
[55:13] offering something for something you
[55:14] have or offering you something in
[55:15] exchange for something ask what's in it
[55:17] for
[55:18] them because it might seem to you
[55:21] apparent what's in it for you but you
[55:23] should ask what's in it for them and
[55:25] really what's in it for me like what am
[55:28] I really getting out of this you've
[55:29] offered me this car for free but why why
[55:34] are you doing this what are you getting
[55:35] out of this I had a situation here in my
[55:38] life recently where something was
[55:39] offered to me at um a couple years ago I
[55:42] think now something was offered to me
[55:44] and it was wow you should take it this
[55:46] is a fantastic opportunity and I was
[55:49] like no uh-uh I don't want it and then
[55:54] other events happened later on I
[55:55] realized it was a
[55:57] trap that had I done that the mess I
[56:00] would have been in or how I would have
[56:01] tried to get myself out of the
[56:02] consequences of it would have been a
[56:05] just would have very very difficult I
[56:07] believe God could have rescued me but it
[56:08] was his grace at the time for me to say
[56:10] nah I realize what's in it for me looks
[56:13] really really really good but even if
[56:16] you seem to be sincere in your heart and
[56:18] there's nothing in it for you I need to
[56:20] have
[56:21] wisdom that really what's going on here
[56:25] what's behind the scenes what's the
[56:27] motive and objective and I know we run
[56:29] the risk that when we leave church today
[56:31] and someone says Hey I want to take you
[56:32] to lunch my treat you're going to be oh
[56:33] whoa what are you up to right I and it's
[56:36] not just to make ourselves suspicious of
[56:38] one another if anything we need to get
[56:39] to know one another better spend time
[56:42] with one another get to know one another
[56:44] amen did I finish the story about that
[56:47] tribe in Europe are we satisfied where
[56:48] that went I think they ended up undoing
[56:51] it it's a phenomenal book now
[56:57] if he brother John if you could show my
[57:00] title slide I I need to start providing
[57:02] this maybe a little bit more accessible
[57:04] format if he only showed up like
[57:07] this and I use this to convey the image
[57:10] of this is what's happening but he
[57:12] doesn't show up with the
[57:14] horns you know when did he become a
[57:17] hornless devil where's the tail where's
[57:19] the Pitchfork where's the voice right
[57:22] come on I want you to smell like
[57:24] Brimstone I want you to have flies
[57:26] around you I want to know it's you Satan
[57:29] but he transforms he's transformed into
[57:31] an angel of Light his ministers
[57:33] themselves as Ministers of righteousness
[57:35] they're not righteous but they appear as
[57:37] it if it was only this easy when Lucifer
[57:40] himself old Satan the Devil the dragun
[57:42] the deceiver the poacher the squatter if
[57:44] only his business card said I'm the
[57:46] squatter I'm looking for a
[57:48] squage and we know no I don't know that
[57:51] I want my house to be a squage and he'
[57:54] be like give me that right I want the
[57:56] card back I only printed so
[57:58] many but but it's not this easy this is
[58:01] not his business card this is not his
[58:05] show on home and garden Network or
[58:08] whatever it is right even though maybe
[58:10] it make a good
[58:11] idea the he is in this
[58:14] business so now and I don't think I have
[58:17] these quotes my next scripture is Luke
[58:18] 16 brother John I'm going to come to it
[58:20] here in a moment but I'm going to work
[58:21] through this really really fast listen
[58:23] to these things that brother Bram says
[58:25] cuz we're asking how did how did Adam go
[58:27] from house and home to
[58:29] homeless in the second seal brother
[58:32] Brandon speaking of the church says she
[58:34] sold her birth
[58:37] rights her virtuous right of the word so
[58:41] this is a church that does it and then
[58:43] he's making the parallel that the church
[58:45] in NAA the church under the force of the
[58:48] Catholic church and this transaction
[58:49] with the Antichrist Spirit she sold her
[58:52] birthrights he says when ID did it she
[58:54] lost the creation whole creation fell
[58:57] under her what did Eve do as being
[59:00] co-equal with
[59:02] Adam she sold to the she sold her
[59:07] Birthright she sold her her rights to
[59:10] the word to
[59:12] Satan right now you're thinking wait a
[59:14] minute I think but she sold something
[59:18] right he can't have legal possession so
[59:20] she sold something he said in the third
[59:22] seal the very next day and E forfeited
[59:24] her virtuous rights and gave them over
[59:26] to Satan in the Garden of Eden and he's
[59:28] saying the church does the same thing it
[59:30] forfeits her Bible and then he says if
[59:33] you want to see what's coming so this is
[59:35] really important I'll slow
[59:46] down he
[59:48] says the church did the same thing when
[59:51] they forfeited the Bible for their
[59:52] Creeds and reasonings see how it types
[59:56] you just run those types you're bound to
[59:58] come out right if I've never seen myself
[1:00:01] and I saw my shadow coming I'll know
[1:00:04] just about what I look
[1:00:07] like this is critical to where I'm
[1:00:09] wanting to arrive if you want to see
[1:00:13] what is coming look at what has
[1:00:16] been now I'm wanting you to look at what
[1:00:19] Satan has done to understand what he's
[1:00:22] doing if you want to know what's coming
[1:00:24] look at what's been for for the old all
[1:00:27] the old things were Shadows of things to
[1:00:29] come the Bible said and what is he W us
[1:00:31] to understand the transaction in the
[1:00:34] garden where Eve lost creation when she
[1:00:37] sold her birthrights she forfeited her
[1:00:40] virtuous word the word of God when she
[1:00:41] sold the Bible and put a man in there
[1:00:45] that says the church has the rights to
[1:00:46] change anything they want to change
[1:00:47] they've done and the bride of Christ the
[1:00:49] Pentecostal bride sold her virtue at NAA
[1:00:52] just as Eve sold her virtue to Satan in
[1:00:55] the Garden of Eden so Eve had something
[1:00:59] to sell and Satan was
[1:01:04] buying and Satan
[1:01:06] bought her
[1:01:09] virtue now listen for some of these
[1:01:12] words three kinds of Believers brother
[1:01:13] Bram speaking of an organization great
[1:01:15] people yes sir they're organizers
[1:01:17] they're prosperous successful Smart in
[1:01:20] worldly wisdom just exactly like Satan
[1:01:23] did to Eve that little helpless woman so
[1:01:27] he had a he was shrewd he had a wisdom
[1:01:30] he had a gospel he came right to her and
[1:01:33] tried to sell her on the idea that she
[1:01:36] would be wiser than what she was and
[1:01:38] that's what she was looking for instead
[1:01:41] of staying right with the word said he
[1:01:43] wanted to to what the word said he
[1:01:45] wanted to sell her on the idea that she
[1:01:48] would be wiser and she bought his
[1:01:51] product and they still do the same thing
[1:01:54] today Satan is still selling
[1:01:57] products and the woman is still buying
[1:02:00] products because she was a
[1:02:04] byproduct he wanted to sell her on the
[1:02:07] men are buying products too because he
[1:02:08] brought forth a
[1:02:10] byproduct he came to her to sell her he
[1:02:13] sold her she
[1:02:17] sold he
[1:02:19] bought thinking man's filter and he's
[1:02:22] equating Eve and Judas together and how
[1:02:24] Judas sold for 30 pieces of silver sold
[1:02:28] their birthrights for a satisfaction of
[1:02:30] the taste of the knowledge of
[1:02:33] civilization that's exactly what Eve
[1:02:35] sold her birthrights for she sold it for
[1:02:37] a taste of science for a little taste of
[1:02:40] worldly knowledge so now you have
[1:02:41] worldly wisdom and worldly knowledge she
[1:02:43] sold it a little better church a little
[1:02:46] better class of people today it would be
[1:02:47] called now are you recognizing a pattern
[1:02:51] to the transaction you have the word you
[1:02:54] have the way of the tree of life you
[1:02:57] have a garden a happy Paradise you have
[1:03:00] protection and provision and everything
[1:03:02] that God wants to provide there's this
[1:03:04] word way of life where God is you're
[1:03:06] going to protect you he's going to give
[1:03:07] you pleasure all those things and now
[1:03:09] there's this wrestling cuz Satan comes
[1:03:11] and he wants to buy something and he's
[1:03:14] promising that in the transaction you'll
[1:03:16] get be better off you'll get out of
[1:03:19] debt you'll have a better job you'll
[1:03:21] have a better boss you'll have better
[1:03:23] this you'll have better that better
[1:03:24] opportunities he has want something he
[1:03:26] wants to sell you by worldly wisdom by
[1:03:28] worldly knowledge and he wants to give
[1:03:30] you a taste for something better in the
[1:03:32] first seal brother B was talking about
[1:03:33] an Assemblies of God preacher and he
[1:03:34] says that they were trying to get one of
[1:03:36] his children on a television show to see
[1:03:39] if he was smarter than the next man that
[1:03:40] would run for president and he said he's
[1:03:43] got a lot of wisdom so has
[1:03:46] Satan he tries to sell it Satan's trying
[1:03:49] to sell wisdom he sold it to Eve he sold
[1:03:53] it to us so Satan is selling in you
[1:03:56] wisdom and
[1:03:59] knowledge and as he tries to sell you
[1:04:01] this wisdom and knowledge you are going
[1:04:04] to buy it in exchange you've got to give
[1:04:08] him something so he is buying something
[1:04:11] from you and he's using
[1:04:14] knowledge and wisdom as that uh as part
[1:04:19] of the transaction it's part of the
[1:04:21] consideration it's part of the contract
[1:04:24] if you'll let me have this I'll give you
[1:04:27] this and this is what comes with it and
[1:04:29] begin think oh better better better
[1:04:32] better oh this is good in Luke Chapter
[1:04:38] 16:8 let's see who should I ask if I've
[1:04:40] run out of
[1:04:43] time or eyes are just D darting out of
[1:04:46] the
[1:04:49] room and the Lord commanded the unjust
[1:04:51] Steward I'm jumping right into the
[1:04:53] middle of a parable but something he
[1:04:54] says in here that stands out to me
[1:04:56] because he had done wisely and this is
[1:04:58] as it's presented in the attitude of the
[1:05:02] Lord he's used in a phrase that the Jews
[1:05:05] would have used for the CH the children
[1:05:07] of this world are in their generation
[1:05:10] wiser than the children of light now to
[1:05:13] the Jews they were the enlightened ones
[1:05:15] they're the ones that serve a God and
[1:05:16] they're the children of light and then
[1:05:17] there's this sense of the children of
[1:05:20] this world are
[1:05:21] wiser in their generation in other words
[1:05:24] they're Suited
[1:05:26] for the world that they are
[1:05:28] of you
[1:05:30] following they're wiser in their
[1:05:32] generation it's it's not necessarily
[1:05:34] implying a particular um progeny but
[1:05:38] it's children of the
[1:05:40] world are in the world they seek nothing
[1:05:44] but the world and they are suited for
[1:05:48] that as a Gentiles are suited to seek
[1:05:50] after clothing and Comforts and houses
[1:05:52] and lands this is just their their
[1:05:55] nature that way and this is a product of
[1:05:58] the transaction in the Garden of Eden
[1:06:01] that Satan set us on this path of
[1:06:04] accumulating resources and wealth and
[1:06:07] and possessions and pretense and the
[1:06:09] politics it's just swn into the hybrid
[1:06:11] nature of mankind that children of this
[1:06:14] world are suited for the world that they
[1:06:17] are of be the fact that you have a
[1:06:19] natural birth gives you an inclination
[1:06:21] to Natural Things and if you just follow
[1:06:24] that path you're Ed for how can I be the
[1:06:27] richest how can I possess how can I
[1:06:31] have but brother Bram said the woman
[1:06:34] swapped the word of God for personal
[1:06:40] knowledge then he says in the sermon
[1:06:42] lean not to th own understanding we find
[1:06:44] that Eve was easily persuaded by Satan
[1:06:46] from the
[1:06:48] word yeah we're we'll come to that here
[1:06:50] in a moment she was easily persuaded by
[1:06:52] Satan from the word and she leaned on
[1:06:54] her own understanding
[1:06:56] because Satan had projected something to
[1:06:58] her which wasn't to her real
[1:07:01] understanding of God she has a real
[1:07:04] understanding of God that suffices that
[1:07:07] should be anchoring right so then
[1:07:09] there's this uh present presentation of
[1:07:12] another understanding which contradicts
[1:07:15] this and she ought to have said I'll
[1:07:17] stick with the
[1:07:19] word but there is more going on here he
[1:07:21] projects he sells he wants to buy well
[1:07:24] I'll take this and you I'll give you
[1:07:26] that let's have some sort of exchange
[1:07:27] she
[1:07:29] swaps and he says that she had to have
[1:07:33] something else told to her by the enemy
[1:07:35] Satan and she believed it now we find
[1:07:37] the results of this it plunged the whole
[1:07:38] human race to death because the first
[1:07:40] mother on Earth leaned to her own
[1:07:42] understanding contrary to the word of
[1:07:44] God and it pledged the whole human race
[1:07:46] to death and he cares do you care he
[1:07:49] says we realize that it was reason
[1:07:51] common reason is that started the ball
[1:07:53] of sin rolling at the first place it was
[1:07:55] reasoning what reasoning against the
[1:07:57] word of God when God told Adam and Eve
[1:07:59] the day you eat thereof that day you die
[1:08:00] that settles it that's all of it and he
[1:08:02] fortified them against the enemy behind
[1:08:05] his word but when Eve listening to
[1:08:08] Satan's reasonings culture understanding
[1:08:11] education
[1:08:13] advancement see he has something to sell
[1:08:15] us and if you want to know what's coming
[1:08:18] look at what's been and be very
[1:08:21] practical in our own personal lives what
[1:08:23] is being sold to us ever been told hey
[1:08:26] just come sit down for an hour and
[1:08:28] listen to our spill and we'll give you
[1:08:30] five free nights at a resort in at Rocky
[1:08:34] Point and you're like let's do this just
[1:08:38] got to sit there for an hour good luck
[1:08:40] if it's an hour right and before you
[1:08:42] know it you're being forced and
[1:08:44] contriving to buy a time share I thought
[1:08:46] we're going to have five free nights now
[1:08:47] we're in bondage for the next 30 Years
[1:08:49] right you know how it is it's
[1:08:52] pressure it's pretense they pull on so
[1:08:54] many different things she stopped
[1:08:56] stepped out behind the word listened to
[1:08:58] Satan's reasonings did the thing that
[1:09:00] God said don't do be very practical
[1:09:02] about these things today that when God
[1:09:04] has a word for you to obey in order for
[1:09:06] you to not do it Satan has bargained in
[1:09:09] exchange and whether you realize it or
[1:09:11] not you're transacting with the devil to
[1:09:13] lose something and what you gain is to
[1:09:16] your
[1:09:18] disadvantage and if one reasoning this
[1:09:20] is this is I feel like I can just race
[1:09:22] to the finish line now if one reasoning
[1:09:25] listen list to one reason against the
[1:09:26] word of God caused all this chaos one
[1:09:29] reason against the word again won't take
[1:09:31] you back to the same place if one
[1:09:34] reasoning caused Adam to be
[1:09:36] homeless one reason against the word of
[1:09:39] God caused him to be homeless how much
[1:09:41] more observant and aware ought we to be
[1:09:44] on a daily basis about how we can become
[1:09:48] homeless cuz he how foolish it would be
[1:09:52] for God to bring man back upon the same
[1:09:54] basis he sent him out
[1:09:56] from in other words if he sent him out
[1:09:58] on the basis because he disobeyed why
[1:10:00] would God bring you back on the basis of
[1:10:04] Disobedience remember wisdom builds
[1:10:07] understanding establishes and knowledge
[1:10:09] fills each one of these places I could
[1:10:12] have read you so many more places
[1:10:13] brother Abraham saying it was wisdom
[1:10:15] that the devil gave the woman it was not
[1:10:19] uh understanding that the woman relied
[1:10:21] on and he gave her and it was knowledge
[1:10:24] that he sold her right and brother
[1:10:26] Brandman spoken words of the Original
[1:10:27] Seed she hybrid it brought the serpent
[1:10:30] in listening for wisdom understanding
[1:10:33] and
[1:10:35] knowledge the things that build a
[1:10:39] house the things that make a house a
[1:10:43] home so when Satan was in the Garden of
[1:10:46] Eden he wasn't just looking uh he wasn't
[1:10:49] looking in our minds let's be very he
[1:10:50] wasn't just uh you know you know feeling
[1:10:53] all Randy and wanted a relationship
[1:10:55] right we're being adults right he just
[1:10:58] wasn't wanting to go on a date he wanted
[1:11:01] to take possession he wanted to be God
[1:11:05] he wanted to be king and this is his
[1:11:07] method of operation he's going to sell
[1:11:09] you wisdom he's going to sell you
[1:11:11] understand he's going to sell you
[1:11:11] knowledge for the purpose of you
[1:11:13] exchanging your home for other elements
[1:11:17] and you think you're building a home you
[1:11:19] think you're getting ahead you think
[1:11:20] you're making progress and you're
[1:11:22] actually forfeiting virtue you're for
[1:11:25] fit in real wisdom real understanding
[1:11:27] real knowledge that is the manner the
[1:11:29] way of the tree of life and you're
[1:11:32] taking the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:11:35] Evil and you're building with wisdom and
[1:11:38] understanding knowledge and advancement
[1:11:39] and everything looks like it's clicking
[1:11:40] and everything's moving along but all
[1:11:42] along there's a little bit of an
[1:11:42] emptiness all along there's a lack of
[1:11:44] spiritual success all along there's an
[1:11:46] unwinding and unraveling and you need
[1:11:47] God to wake up your eyes and say wait a
[1:11:49] minute I've been
[1:11:52] had we listening for wisdom
[1:11:54] understanding and
[1:11:56] knowledge if you're wondering why I'm
[1:11:58] preaching so long my ears
[1:12:02] unstopped and someone's going why did I
[1:12:04] pray why did I even
[1:12:07] pray brother BR said having faith in all
[1:12:09] his word his seeds God brought an Eden
[1:12:11] of Holiness love and eternal life that's
[1:12:13] what God's Eden produced is Holiness and
[1:12:16] it brought an Eden of Holiness of love
[1:12:18] he said understanding Perfection eternal
[1:12:20] life wisdom knowledge understanding
[1:12:23] there Eve had Godly wisdom Godly
[1:12:25] understanding Godly knowledge and Satan
[1:12:28] wanted to sell a base wisdom a base
[1:12:30] understanding a base knowledge a
[1:12:31] perverted worldly so there's your you
[1:12:34] say well I don't want wisdom you better
[1:12:35] ask for it we talk about knowledge and
[1:12:38] understanding there's a worldly
[1:12:39] knowledge there's an academic knowledge
[1:12:40] there's a human head knowledge there's
[1:12:41] an intellectual faith those aren't the
[1:12:43] things we're talking about we're talking
[1:12:44] about wisdom understanding and knowledge
[1:12:46] with all you're getting get
[1:12:47] understanding right there's a wisdom of
[1:12:49] the Divine there's a knowledge of the
[1:12:50] Divine there's things we should be
[1:12:52] calling upon God for Revelation more
[1:12:54] than anything amen
[1:12:56] but brother BR said eve forfeited her
[1:12:57] virtuous rights he said eve sold her
[1:13:03] virtue so how did Adam become
[1:13:06] homeless because the
[1:13:08] woman engaged in a
[1:13:11] transaction in which she exchanged
[1:13:14] home for what she thought would build a
[1:13:17] better
[1:13:18] home for what she thought was better and
[1:13:22] in that transaction Adam instead of
[1:13:25] making her homeless and houseless Adam
[1:13:27] forfeited his own rights knowing that
[1:13:31] what they would lose would go back to
[1:13:33] God and it would set off a conse I don't
[1:13:36] know exactly all that he knew but it
[1:13:38] would set off a a domino effect and a
[1:13:40] consequence of events where now
[1:13:42] everybody's raging over
[1:13:44] possession and the world would no longer
[1:13:47] be home to the point to where we call
[1:13:49] ourselves pilgrims and strangers to this
[1:13:53] day tow dra an analogy in Matthew 12: 43
[1:13:57] to
[1:14:04] 45 look at this by way of an analogy I'm
[1:14:07] wanting to continue to build if you want
[1:14:09] to see what is coming look at what has
[1:14:10] been for all the old things were Shadows
[1:14:12] of the things to come Eve and a
[1:14:15] transaction lost her
[1:14:20] home man Humanity mankind the original
[1:14:24] lost it's home because Satan was buying
[1:14:27] the
[1:14:29] home I haven't quite made this point I'm
[1:14:32] certain I'll make it before it's over
[1:14:35] but in other words Satan was saying oh
[1:14:39] you can keep the
[1:14:41] house I just want the
[1:14:44] home you follow me sometimes we're
[1:14:47] looking more to the Natural Things to
[1:14:49] find out whether or not we're
[1:14:51] successful and Satan's like oh no you
[1:14:53] can keep that right I just want the
[1:14:57] atmosphere oh no no no you can keep that
[1:15:00] I just want the
[1:15:02] home right oh no no no you can have all
[1:15:05] that I just want your
[1:15:07] mind when the unclean Spirit has gone
[1:15:09] out of a man he walketh through Dry
[1:15:11] places seeking rest and findeth none the
[1:15:13] unclean Spirit
[1:15:15] does then he saith I'll return into my
[1:15:18] house it's asserting
[1:15:21] ownership Authority from when I came out
[1:15:25] and when he is coming and I like the
[1:15:27] wording here because in Luke it says I
[1:15:29] will return unto but now it says I'm
[1:15:31] going to return
[1:15:32] into so the difference here is uh when
[1:15:36] he is a man an unclean spirit is
[1:15:38] dispossessed of an individual I know
[1:15:40] this is really strong language in terms
[1:15:42] of demon possession and those things but
[1:15:44] there's a lot of ways that we could um
[1:15:46] bring that out in the scripture and the
[1:15:47] message of the hour to make it real
[1:15:48] personal for us and applicable on a
[1:15:49] daily basis but when and especially in
[1:15:52] light of a new birth experience when the
[1:15:53] unclean spirit is dis um dispossessed
[1:15:56] and he leaves and Lucas says I'll come
[1:15:58] unto my house and in a way we kind of
[1:16:00] get the idea that he comes back and he
[1:16:01] he kind of knocks on the door and he's
[1:16:03] just kind of checking in the windows but
[1:16:05] he says I'll come back into my
[1:16:08] house there's this this this idea that I
[1:16:11] have a right to this I want to come back
[1:16:14] into it and when I come out and when
[1:16:15] he's
[1:16:17] come huge phrase here this is why I'm
[1:16:19] point it from Matthew 12 he findeth it
[1:16:22] empty yet swept and gone
[1:16:25] garnished okay I want to come back to
[1:16:27] that phrasing empty swept and garnished
[1:16:30] then goeth he and taketh with himself
[1:16:32] seven other Spirits more wicked than
[1:16:33] himself and they enter in and dwell
[1:16:35] there and the last day of that man is
[1:16:38] worse than the first even so shall it be
[1:16:40] unto this wicked
[1:16:42] generation there's a lot of great
[1:16:44] principles that we could draw from this
[1:16:46] on a number of different levels but we
[1:16:49] understand this especially from the word
[1:16:50] of God in the message of the hour we
[1:16:52] understand how this is applicable to our
[1:16:53] individual spiritual Liv
[1:16:55] even with respect to religious spirits
[1:16:57] and certain things where you get cleaned
[1:16:59] up but you don't get the birth and you
[1:17:00] don't get filled but this is very very
[1:17:03] striking and hold to this look at that
[1:17:04] verse 44 as I look at this he comes back
[1:17:08] he enters in he finds it empty swept and
[1:17:13] garnished and he know there's something
[1:17:16] about the condition of the house where
[1:17:20] he feels perfect Liberty to go get some
[1:17:22] roommates
[1:17:24] and to come back it's almost as if now
[1:17:28] he has more room than
[1:17:30] before and he comes back because
[1:17:34] although the house was cleaned out it
[1:17:36] was never made a
[1:17:39] home the house was swept and garnished
[1:17:43] which means adorned or trimmed it was
[1:17:45] embellished to garnish it means to
[1:17:46] decorate beautifully to
[1:17:49] beautify so when it says listen this is
[1:17:51] what's striking it says it was empty and
[1:17:54] I think for us we think in terms of well
[1:17:56] the house is empty and he looked in he
[1:17:59] like nobody lives here there's no way
[1:18:01] anybody lives here I represented a
[1:18:03] client one time in Dallas and uh they
[1:18:05] were the landlords and owned a property
[1:18:08] and um and there was uh they they the
[1:18:12] people had just abandoned the house and
[1:18:14] for insurance purposes he had to
[1:18:15] re-enter the house just for because he
[1:18:17] couldn't get a hold of them it had been
[1:18:18] 30 days and so when he re-enters they
[1:18:20] file a big lawsuit it's going to be a
[1:18:22] big fuss and we went to mediation and
[1:18:24] they paid my client even though they
[1:18:26] sued him they paid us to go away at the
[1:18:29] end of the day but the whole one of the
[1:18:30] whole things with his issue was when he
[1:18:32] went and he was looking in the house he
[1:18:34] realized that though there were things
[1:18:36] in the house it wasn't lived
[1:18:38] in so when we and because there's
[1:18:41] something about a place that's lived in
[1:18:42] that's alive right so when we say it's
[1:18:45] empty I think maybe in our minds we
[1:18:47] think that someone's peering in and it's
[1:18:50] Barren but it was clean and beautified
[1:18:55] but beautified in a shallow
[1:18:58] way to where even when you were still in
[1:19:00] it even though it might have had couches
[1:19:02] and chairs and what was that what was
[1:19:05] the Home Interiors right had plenty of
[1:19:08] home interior parties and the sconces
[1:19:11] and the greenery fake and everything and
[1:19:14] the everything perfect but yet it was
[1:19:18] empty the Spirit came back in it swept
[1:19:22] and beautified but it's not a home
[1:19:25] it's not lived in the way that it should
[1:19:28] be and in that very moment when he found
[1:19:31] it empty it was a house that had not
[1:19:34] been made a home because it was
[1:19:36] filled but
[1:19:38] empty it was garnished
[1:19:41] accessorized but it felt empty and by
[1:19:45] knowledge shall the chambers be filled
[1:19:47] with all precious and pleasant
[1:19:49] riches because it wasn't filled by
[1:19:51] knowledge there wasn't a pleasantness
[1:19:53] there wasn't a happiness wasn't a there
[1:19:55] wasn't a feeling brother bam said the
[1:19:57] eve sold out to reasonings of wisdom and
[1:19:59] education he said knowledge is what the
[1:20:02] devil sold Eve so it was garnished it
[1:20:04] was beautified but it wasn't the kind
[1:20:06] that
[1:20:07] FS brother talks about how civilization
[1:20:10] is of the devil that's what Cain be to
[1:20:11] do in his building when he built a city
[1:20:13] a w a waking place there was a book that
[1:20:16] was published 13 years ago about western
[1:20:18] civilization and how that Western
[1:20:20] Civilization succeeded in some key areas
[1:20:22] that Eastern civilization didn't even
[1:20:24] have Concepts they didn't even have and
[1:20:26] how that now Eastern civilizations are
[1:20:28] beating the Western civilizations at
[1:20:30] their own game and listen to those
[1:20:32] Concepts they're so remarkable the
[1:20:34] concepts of competition science rule of
[1:20:37] law modern medicine consumerism and work
[1:20:39] ethic six things that made Western
[1:20:43] Civilization different than Eastern
[1:20:44] civilizations and these are the very
[1:20:46] things at the heart of the uh the uh
[1:20:49] transactions that we engage in today
[1:20:51] competition science rule of law modern
[1:20:54] message medicine is there any
[1:20:55] coincidence that the rule of law and
[1:20:57] moders Medicine are there together in
[1:20:59] that consumerism work
[1:21:02] ethic these are the things that this
[1:21:05] devil is
[1:21:07] using in the transactions that we're
[1:21:09] engaging
[1:21:11] in I ask you with great soberness and if
[1:21:16] the length of this sermon kind of has
[1:21:19] inv evaded caused your attention span to
[1:21:22] to lessen to weaken and it the breath of
[1:21:25] this and maybe there's a lot here that
[1:21:27] we've been traveling down if it has doed
[1:21:30] you at all to this moment I plead with
[1:21:32] you to wake yourself up and to listen to
[1:21:35] this
[1:21:36] scripture in Mark chapter 8 these two
[1:21:40] scriptures Mark chapter 8: 36 to 37 I
[1:21:43] ask you how much are you willing to sell
[1:21:49] for is it for
[1:21:52] sale do you realize you don't even have
[1:21:54] to put it up for
[1:21:55] sale for there to be an offer
[1:21:59] made you don't have to get an actual MLS
[1:22:01] listing you don't have to go through
[1:22:02] certain
[1:22:04] channels but there's certain
[1:22:06] ways there are certain ways that the
[1:22:08] devil is making an
[1:22:11] offer I sister Elizabeth I have one some
[1:22:15] friends that everything in their house
[1:22:16] is for sale for the right price and I
[1:22:19] think at one time everything was for
[1:22:21] sale literally online like hey if they
[1:22:23] want our bed they want want to buy it
[1:22:24] for that price they can take
[1:22:26] it and in some ways our house our home
[1:22:30] is
[1:22:32] listed some ways it's for sale there's
[1:22:34] offers being made and I want to say this
[1:22:36] Satan will let you keep the house but he
[1:22:39] wants the
[1:22:40] home in Mark chapter 8: 36-37 for what
[1:22:44] shall it profit a man if he gain the
[1:22:46] whole world and lose his own
[1:22:49] soul what would it profit if you could
[1:22:53] have all the material wealth and all the
[1:22:55] material possessions and you could have
[1:22:56] everything the world has to offer but
[1:22:58] yet your soul you lose your
[1:23:01] soul or what shall a man give in the
[1:23:03] continuation of this what shall a man
[1:23:05] give in exchange for his
[1:23:08] soul the question that's posed is what
[1:23:11] value is there in the exchange what are
[1:23:14] you getting out of the transaction if
[1:23:16] you gain the whole world but your soul
[1:23:19] is
[1:23:20] lost and I ask it this way what value is
[1:23:23] it in the decisions we make where we
[1:23:26] gain of the world and worldly things if
[1:23:28] in the final analysis we lose
[1:23:31] home if we lose presence with our
[1:23:34] children we lose closeness with our
[1:23:35] wives there's there's a way that are
[1:23:37] we're transacting and doing business to
[1:23:39] where we're not supporting the ideals of
[1:23:42] home and the preeminence of the word and
[1:23:44] Christ isn't welcome and we're not doing
[1:23:46] what the word says but we're doing
[1:23:48] exactly what God said don't do in that
[1:23:50] transaction no matter how much you could
[1:23:52] show on the one C colum of the balance
[1:23:55] sheet how much have you lost in the
[1:23:59] other what value is there in the
[1:24:02] exchange if you gain the whole world but
[1:24:04] lose your home because he says what
[1:24:07] shall a man give in exchange for his
[1:24:08] soul if you lost your soul he's saying
[1:24:09] in other words if you lost your soul the
[1:24:12] whole world Listen the whole world is
[1:24:14] not valuable enough to buy it
[1:24:18] back think about that if you gain the
[1:24:22] whole world in exchange for your soul
[1:24:25] you cannot reverse that
[1:24:29] transaction if it was possible for me
[1:24:32] now to sell my soul in exchange for the
[1:24:35] entire
[1:24:36] world a and and in the transaction like
[1:24:39] oh you got five days it's the AutoNation
[1:24:41] guarantee right yep five days don't
[1:24:43] drive 250 miles five days you can bring
[1:24:45] it back it's as if it never happened you
[1:24:48] just give us the car back and we'll well
[1:24:51] I guess you didn't really give up
[1:24:52] anything in that case never mind let's
[1:24:53] go back to that tribe in Eastern
[1:24:56] Europe but in this transaction where you
[1:24:58] take you give your soul and you get the
[1:25:01] whole world in exchange and the whoever
[1:25:03] it is that's making the offer
[1:25:04] says if you if you want your soul back
[1:25:07] in five days just come back and just
[1:25:10] give me what I gave you the reality is
[1:25:14] what you've
[1:25:15] traded what you've received in the trade
[1:25:19] doesn't have the value and the Worth to
[1:25:21] get your soul
[1:25:22] back you can't buy buy it
[1:25:25] back even if you offered the whole world
[1:25:27] it's saying the devil's going to would
[1:25:29] say well I don't have your soul you just
[1:25:31] gave it up
[1:25:32] man and what are you going to pay what
[1:25:35] can you pay to get your soul back
[1:25:37] there's nothing in this world that's
[1:25:40] worth losing your soul over because
[1:25:43] there's nothing you can gain in this
[1:25:44] world that you could offer back to God
[1:25:46] where he would give it
[1:25:49] back I hope that helps you with this un
[1:25:52] an understanding of just how important
[1:25:53] spiritual things are and your salvation
[1:25:55] is in other words your soul was so
[1:25:58] valuable nothing in this world could pay
[1:26:00] the price there was only one price that
[1:26:02] could be paid and it's been paid by
[1:26:04] God's grace
[1:26:07] am Satan gets us bargaining all day long
[1:26:11] well Lord I'll do this and Lord I'll do
[1:26:13] that it's as if you're transacting for
[1:26:15] home which say it's the price I
[1:26:18] paid it's it's something I give wisdom
[1:26:21] knowledge and understanding that's
[1:26:21] what's going to give it I've already
[1:26:23] given it all for you I've already
[1:26:24] provide I've already paid for it these
[1:26:25] are things you don't have to transact
[1:26:27] with me Lord I'm going to do my best by
[1:26:29] God's grace I'm going to live clean for
[1:26:30] 30 days and if I could just live clean
[1:26:32] for 30 days Lord and and somehow some
[1:26:34] way do the right thing then Lord would
[1:26:35] you bless me and would you give me
[1:26:37] happiness and give me joy and give me
[1:26:38] peace he's saying that's a wrong wrong
[1:26:40] you're just bargaining with me like the
[1:26:41] devil bargained with you to give it
[1:26:48] up if you lost your soul and had the
[1:26:52] whole world you still couldn't afford
[1:26:53] your soul
[1:26:59] what price continue on this Lord will in
[1:27:02] the next few few services on on this
[1:27:04] analogy what price would you sell your
[1:27:06] home
[1:27:22] for brother bam is telling us what has
[1:27:24] been tells us what will be we could even
[1:27:27] say what is and he said if one reason
[1:27:29] against the word caused the chaos one
[1:27:31] reasoning cause
[1:27:33] man to
[1:27:35] Forfeit
[1:27:37] home then I believe it's faith that
[1:27:39] brings it
[1:27:40] back accepting the word of
[1:27:43] God and if I could just close with two
[1:27:46] other statements I'd like to read to you
[1:27:48] some quotations here from the message of
[1:27:51] the hour going back to Revelations
[1:27:52] chapter 5 part two that sermon brother
[1:27:54] Brandon was preaching that we've already
[1:27:56] read from Satan is a squatter he's a
[1:27:57] squatter brother BR says in the Old
[1:27:58] Testament if a man lost his inheritance
[1:28:00] and a squatter come on his land he could
[1:28:03] not hold it any longer for annihilation
[1:28:06] from the owner until 50 years in other
[1:28:08] words there's law there are certain laws
[1:28:11] that he's making reference to that if a
[1:28:12] man lost his inheritance and a man
[1:28:15] possessed it he can only possess it for
[1:28:16] so long because legal title was an
[1:28:21] absolute and any conveyance was by law
[1:28:25] only for a period of time and then once
[1:28:28] a certain juncture came it would revert
[1:28:29] back to the original owner in a way it
[1:28:32] mirrors God's the reality of how that
[1:28:35] God had planned it after 50 years the
[1:28:38] Year of Jubilee come by and the Year of
[1:28:41] Jubilee when the year of juilee come
[1:28:42] along then everything went back to its
[1:28:43] original beginning again I like that
[1:28:45] original beginning again remember going
[1:28:47] back home to Eden all slaves and went
[1:28:49] back to the original beginning if a man
[1:28:50] was Hing in the field and the trumpet
[1:28:52] sounded he heard it he'd throw down the
[1:28:53] hole and say I'm no more a slave I go
[1:28:54] back home to my family everything was
[1:28:57] given back if a squatter was on the
[1:28:59] ground he'd have to get off the ground
[1:29:01] that's all he got off the ground because
[1:29:04] the legal owner was coming
[1:29:06] back he had to give way he says
[1:29:10] hallelujah one of these days the kingdom
[1:29:12] of this world will fall and the legal
[1:29:14] owners will come in one of these days
[1:29:16] amen and there's this image in scripture
[1:29:18] how this Earth literally this earth is
[1:29:21] made for you and I to rain over whose
[1:29:24] names are on the title who God made it
[1:29:27] for the way that it originally was when
[1:29:30] God created the heavens and the Earth he
[1:29:32] was the owner of it as the one that
[1:29:33] created it but he created it for you and
[1:29:35] I amen he intended all along to hand it
[1:29:38] to his children to give it to this
[1:29:40] family and that's what God envisioned in
[1:29:42] the beginning there will be a day when
[1:29:44] we come back to full possession of
[1:29:47] everything that Adam lost there's coming
[1:29:49] a day when the kingdoms of this world
[1:29:51] will be the kingdoms of our God there'll
[1:29:53] be a day when we will rule and reign
[1:29:55] with him on the Earth all powers all
[1:29:57] principalities everything will be in
[1:29:59] that great not just a millennium but in
[1:30:02] the future home the entire Earth and all
[1:30:05] that is in it will be home to us again
[1:30:07] and I say this if that is true to that
[1:30:09] magnitude that it rings true today that
[1:30:12] when the bul has been given back to us
[1:30:14] in this hour he has made us owners he
[1:30:17] has given us a domain and he's wanting
[1:30:19] you to step up and say I am the owner
[1:30:24] amen and I'm coming home
[1:30:27] today the legal owner coming
[1:30:30] home I say purpose in your heart today I
[1:30:34] I say whether it be you brother Joel as
[1:30:36] being living on your own as a young man
[1:30:38] you brother Kenneth having a large
[1:30:39] family and everyone at home it doesn't
[1:30:41] matter if you're the smallest family in
[1:30:43] the church or the largest family in your
[1:30:44] church you purpose in your heart saying
[1:30:46] the legal owner is going home today and
[1:30:49] like well brother Aaron I'm just
[1:30:50] presently renting just kind of month-to
[1:30:53] month yeah you know what I'm talking
[1:30:54] about home talking about the atmosphere
[1:30:58] talking about applying the token uh
[1:31:00] there's things that we do in our homes
[1:31:02] to give God the premise to give God the
[1:31:04] glory to begin to think about the way of
[1:31:06] the tree of life and not the way of the
[1:31:09] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil not
[1:31:11] the way of competition science rule of
[1:31:13] law modern medicine consumerism and work
[1:31:15] ethic but come back to the principles of
[1:31:18] the way of the tree of life
[1:31:22] amen amen
[1:31:24] good our musicians if you could
[1:31:28] come this statement I taken some of
[1:31:31] these things and I was going to use them
[1:31:32] for another service I just felt
[1:31:34] compelled to bring these
[1:31:41] in brother brand is praying so if we
[1:31:43] could just bow our heads and and I want
[1:31:45] you to focus on the words that I
[1:31:50] use think in your heart
[1:31:57] am I transacting with the devil to sell
[1:31:59] my
[1:32:01] home there's possessions that aren't
[1:32:05] lost there's things that I have I
[1:32:08] haven't
[1:32:10] lost so what have I
[1:32:14] lost Adam and the woman leaving Eden
[1:32:18] bloody bloody image as it's described
[1:32:21] would could have walked out and still
[1:32:23] saw trees and fruit and animals and same
[1:32:26] sun
[1:32:28] and if you would have just listed things
[1:32:30] you'd say well what have we
[1:32:33] lost and to put it just in the
[1:32:35] nomenclature that I've chose to use in
[1:32:37] this service this series we started this
[1:32:39] year is they lost
[1:32:42] home it's very possible that in every
[1:32:46] way of natural
[1:32:49] life in its most General basic sense
[1:32:52] they were living the same lives
[1:32:55] but feeling was
[1:32:56] lost hope and comfort and belonging and
[1:33:01] possession
[1:33:03] familiarity you ever been in a place
[1:33:06] that You' been before and it seemed
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:10] strange you know this I'm trying to
[1:33:13] appeal maybe to children that that first
[1:33:16] time that you ever first time you went
[1:33:17] to your classroom this year at the
[1:33:19] beginning of the
[1:33:20] year when you went on that first day of
[1:33:23] school
[1:33:24] remember how strange the classroom
[1:33:27] seemed and how
[1:33:29] different how new everything was but
[1:33:31] after a
[1:33:33] while it's second nature it lost that
[1:33:36] feeling it's it's just it's so familiar
[1:33:38] to you don't think
[1:33:39] anymore well for Adam and the woman in
[1:33:43] some ways they're in the same classroom
[1:33:46] they're in the same place they're in the
[1:33:47] same workplace but now there's something
[1:33:50] missing they had sold their home
[1:33:55] but kept the
[1:33:59] house because there was something they
[1:34:01] couldn't keep in that transaction and it
[1:34:04] by God's grace it was something that
[1:34:05] Satan didn't
[1:34:07] own so he couldn't forever pervert it or
[1:34:09] destroy
[1:34:11] it and as I'm appealing to you as
[1:34:14] individuals and as families and
[1:34:15] certainly as a
[1:34:18] church There's issues of faithfulness
[1:34:25] issues of the atmosphere that we're Crea
[1:34:28] in our homes and at
[1:34:30] heart is the ways that we treat one
[1:34:32] another the things that we value having
[1:34:34] a
[1:34:36] vision and the burden that we have the
[1:34:41] burden that we have for one
[1:34:43] another brother banam says this as he's
[1:34:45] praying he says may not one who sit here
[1:34:47] tonight and heard the message may not
[1:34:49] one of them be lost because what we're
[1:34:51] talking about is home lost or
[1:34:54] homeless Eden lost from the least child
[1:34:58] to the oldest person may their holy
[1:35:00] desire be only for God in his
[1:35:02] word we know not what our hour may
[1:35:05] appear or what hour he may summon us to
[1:35:08] answer up yonder at the Judgment we
[1:35:10] don't know what hour he may as it was
[1:35:12] take our card from the rack and say it's
[1:35:15] homecoming time you've got to
[1:35:17] go God help us to keep
[1:35:21] pure Grant it Lord
[1:35:24] may we live till the coming of the Lord
[1:35:26] if it be possible and this is where I
[1:35:28] want you to anchor on this may we do
[1:35:31] everything that is in our power with
[1:35:34] love and
[1:35:36] understanding understanding that God is
[1:35:38] searching the world today finding every
[1:35:42] lost
[1:35:43] sheep this is the prayer at the end of
[1:35:47] Satan's
[1:35:49] Eden this is now get yourself right into
[1:35:52] the heart of of everything I've preached
[1:35:54] this morning on Satan's a squatter he's
[1:35:57] a poacher we we've in a way been
[1:35:59] dispossessed but we're coming back to
[1:36:01] our inheritance he says may we have love
[1:36:03] and understanding and may we talk to
[1:36:06] them with seasoned prayer of love and
[1:36:09] the word of God that we might find that
[1:36:13] last one so we can go home and get out
[1:36:17] of this old Eden of Satan here
[1:36:20] Lord that is our vision
[1:36:24] to have a life seasoned with the prayer
[1:36:27] of love and the word of God that we
[1:36:28] might be available to find the lost who
[1:36:32] are The Lost they're the homeless they
[1:36:35] are the ones that have lost home they
[1:36:36] may seemingly have everything else in
[1:36:38] life like oh well they're rich what do
[1:36:40] they need for me oh they've got this
[1:36:41] what do they need for me oh they have
[1:36:43] that what do they need for me oh they do
[1:36:44] this they do that but no what they need
[1:36:46] is
[1:36:47] home Lord but we can't do it with
[1:36:50] worldly wisdom and worldly understanding
[1:36:52] and intellectualism and knowledge of
[1:36:54] this message and just a bunch of hogwash
[1:36:56] and politics and pretense we needs a
[1:36:58] seasoned prayer of love so that we know
[1:37:00] how to talk to them with humility with
[1:37:03] love and understanding that it might
[1:37:05] find the lost so we can go
[1:37:08] home and get out of this old Eden of
[1:37:10] Satan here I believe in a in in a in a
[1:37:14] by type and in a small way you can today
[1:37:17] find rest in Satan's Eden underneath a
[1:37:20] rock you could find a home right where
[1:37:23] we are now in the middle of Satan's Eden
[1:37:24] we could recognize he's a squatter and
[1:37:26] he squatted all around us he's a poacher
[1:37:29] he's a liar he's a deceiver he tried to
[1:37:31] buy the home and he he couldn't afford
[1:37:33] the world so he just tried to buy the
[1:37:35] atmosphere he tried to buy the sky he
[1:37:36] tried to buy the regions and buy the
[1:37:38] people buy off the Kings but I realize
[1:37:40] now his days are numbered full
[1:37:42] possession has come back to me and I
[1:37:43] will take my stand right now in whatever
[1:37:46] domain I can whether it be as an eighth
[1:37:48] grader at a school whether it be as a
[1:37:50] teenager in the home or a mother with
[1:37:52] her children a single mother mother or a
[1:37:54] single father or traditional families
[1:37:56] however you want to look at it I am
[1:37:59] going to come back home today not just
[1:38:02] to a house to home as the legal owner
[1:38:04] and God I want you to give me love power
[1:38:08] love and understanding in the right way
[1:38:10] of life in the way of the Tree of Life
[1:38:13] to rescue those who have been
[1:38:14] overwhelmed by the tree of knowledge of
[1:38:16] Good and Evil so that we can all go
[1:38:20] home and then bring home back to Earth
[1:38:24] beautiful
[1:38:26] picture beautiful picture gracious
[1:38:28] Heavenly
[1:38:30] Father Lord I pray for these today that
[1:38:33] sit here having heard this
[1:38:36] word that they
[1:38:40] would Lord seek your
[1:38:42] face don't do what you said not to do
[1:38:45] but do what you said
[1:38:48] do and father my prayer my Earnest
[1:38:50] prayer is
[1:38:53] that their eyes would be open this was a
[1:38:55] foundational sermon Lord to begin to
[1:38:57] explore very
[1:38:58] practical everyday mechanisms and
[1:39:02] principles maybe not in granular Lord
[1:39:04] but maybe from a higher view Lord I want
[1:39:07] to explore the mechanisms of greed
[1:39:10] and the influences of
[1:39:13] media a lot of very specific things
[1:39:16] though they may not get a whole sermon
[1:39:17] or even multiple sermons or just there's
[1:39:20] things that we could practically
[1:39:22] consider that are part of Satan's
[1:39:25] transaction to get us to sell our
[1:39:29] homes and Lord by way of
[1:39:33] just I I just I pray Just Have Your Way
[1:39:36] in the people's hearts Lord
[1:39:39] today I would father that it would be
[1:39:41] encouraging even to those of us who feel
[1:39:45] especially rebuked maybe even targeted
[1:39:48] if that would be a word Lord there may
[1:39:50] even be some that think that I impr
[1:39:53] preaching this with personal knowledge
[1:39:56] directly to
[1:39:58] them what a challenge Lord in this very
[1:40:01] moment for anyone who would think that
[1:40:03] so Lord I pray if that would even be
[1:40:06] true May their response please
[1:40:09] you may even in that
[1:40:12] Dynamic the way of the tree of life
[1:40:15] would be what would come up with inside
[1:40:17] of
[1:40:18] them and be what would
[1:40:21] respond Lord we realize in our daily
[1:40:23] lives we're challenged with so many
[1:40:25] things and what's remarkable is our
[1:40:28] children so easily see past the Optics
[1:40:30] of playing
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:33] Church our children see so easily past
[1:40:36] the Optics of quote unquote honoring the
[1:40:39] message and so they're the ones that
[1:40:41] suffer the
[1:40:43] most when we merely play lip
[1:40:46] service through shallow actions and
[1:40:49] don't truly demonstrate in our hearts
[1:40:51] that we love the word
[1:40:54] and that we're faithful to the house of
[1:40:55] the
[1:40:58] Lord Lord I say do as you would see fit
[1:41:01] with love and a great passion for your
[1:41:03] word and with a deep love and empathy
[1:41:05] for these people father I pray that you
[1:41:07] would do as you see fit have your way
[1:41:10] Lord have your way but father forgive us
[1:41:14] for our sins forgive us for our
[1:41:16] trespasses Lord give us yet another
[1:41:18] opportunity to do what we can father
[1:41:20] have mercy on those that are Wayward
[1:41:22] have mercy on those who and stubborn and
[1:41:23] obstinate Lord have mercy for those who
[1:41:26] are in the path of the tree of knowledge
[1:41:28] getting further away from the the way of
[1:41:30] the tree of
[1:41:32] life oh God have mercy on
[1:41:34] them let them not suffer loss of
[1:41:38] house as well as
[1:41:41] home be merciful to them that they not
[1:41:43] squander their inheritance fully and
[1:41:46] completely but may they come back to
[1:41:50] [Music]
[1:41:51] you we love you father father bless your
[1:41:54] people I pray in the name of the Lord
[1:41:57] Jesus Christ
[1:42:00] amen amen praise the Lord I may be
[1:42:03] working myself back up to two hour
[1:42:05] sermons
