TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and um but i i feel like i'm very near just delivering this burden we have on this subject of i am an open book and i just want to jump right into it uh and some of these principles we've been fellowshipping on and all of us here i think have been in these services so you are really in tune to what we're wanting to share we took a statement from christ is the mystery of god revealed and it says and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and he's referring to the seven sealed book he's referring to the book of redemption so he says all that's in this book would be him we know christ even as the seals he's the there's a representation in christ and then he says for that's the believer the words in the book so we've been looking at how the bible has become a new book christ fulfilled the old testament the bride's going to fulfill the new testament christ was the written word made flesh of the prophecies to israel now the bride is going to be the full word made manifest in terms of the promise of the new testament and we've been looking at it in this sense that the believer is the interpretation of the written word today the believer today is the interpretation of the written word and we we're bringing a lot of that out of question and answers on the seals the map says don't interpret it don't interpret it don't interpret it we found that he taught later that the life is the interpretation how you live your life how you love your wives and how you raise your children and how you dress and how you act is going to be an interpretation of the word now if you look at colossians chapter 3 i just want to introduce this because i'm wanting to maybe expound upon it to a greater degree in future services and it it's been coming up in my study and kind of been pushing it off a little bit but i want to just read it now and have this scriptural thought in the forefront of your thinking tonight if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god that ought to be uh relevant to all of us if you've been risen with christ if you're born again by the baptism of the holy ghost and uh and you have had this new life inside of you then we ought to be seeking different things and have a different ambition and be desiring other things and things that are natural or earthly so it kind of you begin to set our gaze on the eternal and he says for year dead and your life is hid with christ in god now there's a lot there you are dead we could certainly expound upon that in many different ways how we have um died to the flesh we've died to the things of the world and there's a deadness to the old man but then he says your life is hid with christ so you're hid with christ where in god and and that's putting it in this putting the relationship and position and wanting us to think about where our life is but then he says it's hid with christ in god we know there's a beautiful ways to bring out the hidden life and the the secret life and these things that where your life is hid with christ and god then notice this next statement when christ who is our life so it says your life is hid with christ in god and then it says when christ who is our life so there's your life is hid with christ your life is christ it's really not a separate entity it's not a separate thing where there's just a collection of different lives there in god but he says your life is hid with christ in god so we can look at it this way if you've been risen seek things which are above because your life is there the true life that what you what you crave and what you long for and so he says you're dead and your life is hid with christ in god in christ when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory i want you to think very deeply about that i want you to think in ways that how can this become applicable and really what is this saying because your life which is christ is hid and and it's in god and he says when that life will appear it does something where ye shall appear with him also there's there's going to be something that bursts forth to life and it says in christ who is our life appear it means to make manifest what was hidden so there's a appearing of what was hidden something hidden something unseen and so christ who is our life and it's in colossians and even in the crisis the mystery of god revealed where brother brown's drawing from how that christ is the image of the invisible god and this colossians 1 15 and so he is christ who's the image of the invisible god christ who is the mystery of god that's where your life that is who is your life when he shall appear ye shall appear also with him you shall also appear with him in glory now glory we might think christ is in heaven when he appears we'll appear in heaven but the glory there is something different than a dimension but it's a character it's a it's an excellence of person now to uh just to kind of see what how these things tie together in the word of god and the seed does not air with the shock but the brain says but at the open of the seals revelations 10. notice what he just did there connected is open to the seals of revelations chapter 10. it's an important connection that he makes quite often so at the open of the seals in the fulfillment of revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again i believe he's he's it's it's deliberate that it's revelations 10 because there's the mighty angel comes down uh with the book open there's the sounding of seven thunders uh there's the symbolism of it being sealed up and then it's gonna be finished in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and then john goes to the one who has the book takes it eats it in what prophesies again so he's saying this is all at the open of the seals revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again if you're using the language of birth that means life comes forth the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god so to be vindicated there has to be a manifestation that's the interpretation in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth so just as christ fulfilled the promises in his day the forward's going to be born into manifestation today in its full strength as it was when he was here on earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on earth that's how you could see in the scripture that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished this it's going to be born into manifestation again it's going to be expressed it's going to be lived out and i i think on a wednesday night it affords us the opportunity sometimes just to make quick references to certain things we know that uh the open of the seals brought quickening power and brotherhood says one place to snatch us from death to life and it's this quickly empowered that brings the manifestation it's the quickening power is loosed upon the bride to bring forth life he says in one place the fullness of the word come into existence he says or the open of the seals so the opening of the seals is the full word coming into existence made available a loose it's being revealed and we know that manifestation follows revelation because we could all uh we could we could look at the message and can't argue that brother man taught the revelation of the seven seals has come but what need what is needed not just a revelation but a manifestation and so it's the revelation of the seven thunders i think it's even in a third seal where brother branham is saying there's no manifestation of god yet to stir the bride but he says i'll take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up so the reveal of the seven thunders brings a a manifestation of god or a revelation of christ to stir us up to life and he says if they even be risen with christ there's something that stirs us up something that animates us and brings us to an audience with christ and then christ is the mystery god revealed brother brahm is saying she is now risen the body of christ is now risen so there was some something transpiring then in that season that's very important to catch a hold of now that is just one portion of the sermon i want you kind of look at that as something you could just reference as kind of indicating what direction we're going now i want to drop back for some moments here and try to do it so very quickly so in my slides i think i just put up some key statements because i want to go very quickly through question and answers on the seals and i think we maybe took two services doing that so i'm not going to be an hour and 45 minutes reviewing it i just want to hit it real quick but the ram says and it was a little lamp talking about the interpretation they had of john or the messiah coming he's going to have that mile-long spear and pick off people from the hills of judea says it was but when it came he says it was a little lamb moving out among them meek and gentle pushed around this way in that way even john said go ask him is actually he the one so humble till that prophet missed it so the manifestation of the word of god in that day was even so humble that the forerunner wrestled with the manifestation of what he foreign there was i would say wrestling he rather eventually asked an honest question uh there is because it was the uh expected expectation versus interpretation as it was a little lamb humble meek and so humble to that prophet missed it so then he says you just go and these are just clips sound bites you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a christian life go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for christ and tell the people how you love him and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people because if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and then you're off the beaten track so if you're not living the life if you're not going to church if you're not burning for christ you twist yourself out into something else you're off the path you're off the way that you ought to be going the path that's going to lead you to the intended result so again just skipping around he says you just go ahead and just be humble and go right on with the same plain message now you say brother brandon we be in the church of the living god shouldn't we and why can't i and i ought to have he says no no right there's this expectation something great something fantastic all right we should be able to do this we should be able to do he says no no no whatever it is he's referring to he says just be humble go on with the same plain message then he said he's answering the question would the bride of uh of christ have a ministry before the rapture and he says his answer says sure absolutely she's going to have a a ministry he says sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the minister the hour it'll be so humble it's a great ministry but it's humble it says how many was here at the first last sunday remember what i preached on humility oh don't forget that i'm going to stop a minute to warn that again remember when god predicts anything great to happen the people are looking so far away by their wisdom till they miss what happens so when you're when god's going to do something great god's going to do something great god's going to do something everybody starts looking for something great and they look right over the top of it look right over the top of it when it happens because they're looking for some great ministry some some some powerhouse some move that's going to get everybody's attention and yet it just comes in a very simple way even though it's powerful and even though people's attention may beget it's not always everyone oh wow isn't this awesome and this wonderful is usually something simple and humble to where the people look right over it then he says speaking of the disciples they didn't the people and the first coming they didn't understand it even the disciples didn't get it that's right simplicity be humble go right down when god promises something big it is big in his sight and he says take that blade of grass remember he's talking about that blade of grass he says it has life in it it's so simple and humble and then he talks about a big man if a big man if he's a big man all right but if he's big enough that he can become simple he'll find god but if you don't become simple he'll never see him so you've got to become simple he says get humble just stay humble so that's our goal get humble and then stay humble what is it they say about humility it's a funny thing as soon as you think you have it you lost it and so you want to get humble and stay humble now i provided this statement um from question answers on the seals could i want us to start i want to see the these things together he says don't put your own interpretation to anything you just go on and live a good christian life because you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it if you put your own interpretation to it stop living the christian life you get off the beaten path you twist yourself out of what god has intended it for and god's intent is that the man would live by the word of god and that would be the word expressed so he says you gotta live a good christian life or you wind yourself away from the real thing you only wind your way again away from the thing and all you are conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it is happening and i know what it is it's been told to you before so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour we're living in a time where thee well we're will you just be real humble be a christian and try to live for god and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you he's not trying to distract from the truth he's not trying to say oh well you know do a little bit of a head fake to keep you from thinking he got real close to telling you what it was but he's given you the key to what it is he's really pointing us in the right direction that we're living in a great hour where there's going to be an interpretation there's going to be a great happening he knows what it is he's being very careful with his language he says so just live for god be a christian live honest with your fellow man love those who don't love you don't try to make any you see you do you only make it a mysterious something and mess the real program of god up so there's a way that we can act a way that we can conduct ourselves even with this sense that some great mysterious thing has happened and we mess the program of god up now whether you want to take it to mean that whatever god's program is you've upset his program or whether or not you mess the program of god up for your own life you getting out of cater which is living a good christian life upsets the continuity of what god is wanting to accomplish at the very time that these seals are being preached so he says if you're planting wheat plant your wheat if you're digging potatoes go on and dig them out if i knew he was coming tomorrow and i was a farmer i'd put my crop in today if you made me a farmer i'm going to stay right at my duty i think i have some of these statements there if i'm home potatoes it'll just be hohen just as hard as i can he says dig the potatoes and go to church and write on if it takes place in the morning you'll be found doing just exactly what you're supposed to be doing don't start he says when you do you twist the very thing away from the purpose that it's intended for so if you're planting wheat plant wheat if you're digging potatoes dig potatoes if you're a mechanic be a mechanic do what you're supposed to be doing and if you have this expectation and desire to see the coming of the lord he said just keep doing what you're supposed to do because that's the only way to get there keep doing what you're supposed to do because it's going to be through daily life daily living when you're doing what you're supposed to be doing do it at your post of duty consecrating your life to god whatever whatever it is you're asked to do whether a brother or sister in christ be at your post of duty because that is the only way you're going to come to that great climax in that meeting in the air if you're going to i think it was way that it had struck me one time and i preached on farmers i think farmers was even in my title and it was probably clickbait to a lot of people there's farmers in the rapture and what's strong is if you're going to see the supernatural it's going to happen while you're farming if we're going to go out and just stare stare on the horizon for something supernatural to happen you're going to miss it but if you'll just go back in the field and start holding that row start picking weeds planting potatoes harvesting wheat doing whatever it is you're supposed to do that's where you see the supernatural is when you're doing what you're supposed to do there was a time when israel was going to anoint its first king and a prophet was commissioned by god to go anoint a king and the prophet arrived and he said hey go get all your sons i want to anoint one of your sons to be a king and all the ones that showed up for the meeting and took a day off none of them were the king who was the king the one that was still out there in the field doing what he's supposed to do about his duty and i had to go get him out of the field to come and be anointed so if there's going to be an anointing come it's not because you've got some special appointment where you take your day off and it happens it's going to happen while you're doing what you're supposed to do every day as a christian so as we have these things kind of lined up before us now let's let's step forward to the seventh seal which was preached that evening and i want to read these statements to you to connect with the theme that was in question and answers on the seals that morning i had several other places from god hiding himself in simplicity all the way up through the sixth seal where brother-in-law's kind of using a similar language be humble stay simple but now let's just follow this this i don't even think i provided this quote so just listen to what i'm sharing with you and be very in tune to these elements that he's referring to because he's going to refer the third poll and and he's referring to actually right here where we start the vision that he had at the third pole which is a three-part vision and and he's the other parts with respect to fishing and lacing the booty and then he's carried away to this great cathedral and then there's a little room and you how many here are all familiar with that with those tellings he says just then he picked me up and he took me up and set me way up high to where a meeting was going on looked like a tent or a cathedral of some sort and i looked and there was a little box like little place over in the side and i see that light was talking to somebody above me and that light you see there on the picture so this is a pillar fire it world away from me like that went over to that tent and said i'll meet you there this will be the third pull and you won't tell it to anybody and that's why he's so careful can't tell to anybody can't tell if anybody can't tell to anybody right have you made you've all made that connection where brother ram is so reluctant to share more it's because of this commandment that he received at the time that this vision was given that pillar of fire which is the uh veiling god or declaring his presence goes into that little room and he says i'll meet you there and he says and that will be the third pull and brother he says and you won't tell it to anybody and in sabino canyon he said this is the third pool now this is intentional there's one here in 56 and when he first tells the story this will be the third pool now in 1963 he says this is the third pool so it's not a will be anymore it's important to understand that and he said there's three great things that go with it and one unfolded today he says yesterday one unfolded yesterday the other one folded today and there's one thing i cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language i really wanna i wanna share something with you but i don't wanna get started on it because it's a separate it's a whole separate line but i'll just say it i'll just say it to you all tonight if we have to cut the tape we'll do it how was that seventh church age ushered in gifts speaking in tongues so then what has to follow the interpretation what interprets it the life that's what we are the bride that is raised up in this bright age is the interpretation that follows the tongues and so he says in this he says there's an unknown language and he says it needs an interpretation remember what it takes to interpret it he says but i was standing right there and looked right straight at it and this is the third pull coming up and the holy spirit of god oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent and he says now i better stop right there i feel checked to say no more about it because he's right there he's right there at the seventh seal he's right there at this time of this great unfolding he's this is the third pool you must not say anything about it he says i feel checked to say no more about it and he says so just remember the seventh seal the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and i want you to know before i even note a word about that the vision come years ago and i i i forgot to bring my other set of notes right i have this sermon this excerpt printed out and you can see exactly where they stop it's right here in this area here where they stop and they published a different tape and so some of these things we're reading right now weren't even released to the public until after brother branham had passed away he said so just remember the seventh seal the reason they didn't reveal no one should know about it and he says and here it is just this other slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and god knows my heart i never one time thought of such a thing as that and here it was it's later than we think oh my just shows it's from god it fits exactly in the promises of god for the end time message you notice now for the end time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but didn't say anything about the seventh and the end time seal when it starts it will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible it says and remember revelations chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angels message all the mysteries of god should be known we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal a lot of if you'll notice the language that brother branham uses about the third pull is the same language he uses about the seventh seal it's even the same language he uses about the coming of the lord same exact language secret third pull mystery not public not known paragraph 305 just continuing they open to the seventh seal now how did i know the other day last sunday a week ago today when i was preaching on be humble be humble remember god deals in the little things so he's talking about this is the third pull this is the seventh seal and you could tell he's astounded by these things never in my life i thought this and this is this is the end time message it fits perfectly he says but last week i was preaching on be humble be humble remember god deals in little things i didn't realize what it really was talking about and now i see it it is in such a humble way you'd think that something like that would be revealed to the vatican but it comes just like john the baptist it comes like the birth of our lord and is stable glory to god soul help me the hour is at hand we are here he's looking at this tremendous event the seventh seal the open of the seven seals the the the interpretation of these seven thunders he says something like this that all the church will just look forward to that everyone is expecting to happen you'd think it would happen in the vatican some great cathedral something big and something worldwide known and great he says but it comes like john the baptist the forerunner it comes like the birth of our lord jesus in a stable he goes right back to forerunner and the coming of christ he said the hour is at hand we're here glory to god so help me we're here but he's saying be humble remember god deals in the little things he says this is what uh this is what he's arriving at even after he's preached this this far into the seventh seal so then he comes to the very end of the sermon he preached that evening he said there's no great man among us we're not great men not great women we're all brothers and sisters all the same in the same bracket i encourage all of us here in this church to look at one another as being the same if you've been serving the lord in this message for 40 years and someone else has only been serving them for four months look at one another as the same see yourself and the one who's coming up behind you when you look at someone who's been serving the lord for 40 years and you've only been serving them 40 months 4 months maybe look to something in them that you know you aspire to be or see yourself and one another don't look down on one another i was so overwhelmed uh this week with with the thought of just the the where god has manifested himself in this end time it's in humility it's in simple people it's in people that have been rejected and kicked out and despised and thought little of and never felt like they fit in that's where god's revealing himself that's where the truth is being revealed that's where it's really growing and and coming to preeminence he says we're no great he says one don't one don't make one greater than the other one not a thing at all to do no sir but we're all just human beings don't try to interpret the things don't try to do anything more than just live a close life give giving praise and honor to jesus christ he says everybody understand that now amen love him with all your heart he's in no way trying to downplay how significant these events are and the things that are coming up but in his in what he says he says something mysterious has happened and i know what it is whatever's beginning to dawn on his heart whatever is coming up he there's this sensitivity to encourage us and admonish us as christians keep living the life keep doing what you're supposed to do live close to god give praise and honor to jesus christ love them with all your heart now in the table if you were to research the message using the table and i'm not sure if it's paragraphed the same way on in the applications we have on our tablets our cell phones but in the seventh seal the portion that was added the next day it's paragraph 391 with the study version i use but it's it's a segment that's added after the fact he says now do you notice on the open of the seventh seal it's also in a three-fold mystery so he says earlier there's three great things that goes with it one unfolded today yesterday one unfolded today he says it's also in a three-fold mystery this one will speak or this one i have will speak and have spoke that it is the mystery of the seven thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it'll be right at the coming of christ because christ said no one knew when he would return just talk about the threefold mystery and how that it is the mystery of the seven thunders so christ said only god himself knew not even the angels no wonder it wasn't even written you see they hushed nothing take place then angels don't know it nobody knows when he's coming but there'll be seven voices of these seven thunders that will reveal the great revelation at that time so i believe to to us who if we don't know it and it won't be known until that time but we revealed in that day in that hour that it's supposed to be revealed in so if we don't know it now we don't know if it's not known until that time but it will be revealed in that day now when it's supposed to be revealed in i don't have it here in front of me i don't believe so but he makes the statement that it's not yet revealed but it's moving into that cycle because what he said the night before he's preaching it this part it hasn't been revealed yet but it's moving into that cycle he said so the thing for us to do is try to figure it out so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before god and serve him and do all that we know how to do and live good christian lives right at this time what he's thinking about the things he's saying boom boom boom boom it's building this expectation of seventh seal revelations 10 revelations eight one all these big things he says so the thing for us to do i mean you sir surely it would be uh something significant right give the pastor the keys to your house because if the rapture comes you're not going to need it right do all these do all these things get rick something great happen sell the farm you know um stop stop stockpiling and get ready sell everything just kind of wait um everybody put on their sweatsuit and drink the kool-aid and wait for the ufo to come because it's going to happen any moment he says no just live good christian lives be reverent before god here now we find that the sixth seal is open to us we see it and we know that the seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrives now there was some reason that god let these seven voices be thundered you just take that in your mind the reason why he lets it be thundered we find christ the lamb took the book in his hand so he and he opened that seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it again this is what he's recording and replaces uh the portion that he ministered on the night before and if you go back and listen to the part that he originally took out all he's really what he's saying is this was the tent vision i had this is fulfilled this fulfills the tent vision and he feels like he said too much so he kind of wants to retract it and back up a little bit so as to not make too many public direct connections to that so he says it's a hidden mystery uh no one knows it but it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about this seventh thunder mystery so you see it's connected together so brother brahm is making the connection himself that's that much we have an understanding of it today but because the rest of it is all unfolded but this is not unfolded but setting in my room i seen it unfold to this seven thunders now that's as far as we can go right here and now i trust he's brought you right up to the very moment where it's like okay this is what we've all been waiting for this is the moment peel back the curtain speak to us plainly brother branham so he says now this is as far as we could go and now i trust that each and every one of you will figure it out serve god and do that which is right and love him with all your life and serve him and god will take care of the rest god will take care of the rest if there's a reveal and if there's an unfolding if there's a manifestation if there's a truth that's to be quickened to you he even says it earlier if you're to know it he's going to reveal it to he's going to share it with you he's going to um he's going to pour out this understanding and release these things to us so he says just serve god love him do that which is right and god will take care of the rest and i'll say this if you're not doing this serving god doing that which is right and loving him with all your life and serving him then nothing the rest isn't being taken care of it doesn't mean god's not going to do his part but you're going to be left standing not walking in the vision not fulfilling the part that god has for you and if you feel that some things are withheld from you and you're not quite getting the understanding of the blessing that you desire don't try to press harder to figure out all the types and start counting your steps to see if you can add have a bunch of threes and sevens in it no just get to the place where you can serve god do that which is right and love him with all your life and servant and god will take care of the rest and i want you to try to gather a lot of these things in your mind over these last few services uh the following sunday wednesday this sun this wednesday night kind of gather all these things together think of how this all ties together because it's almost as if there's he's running two different things it's almost as if he's teaching a class on the seventh seal but then he's kind of going back to a sunday school class something very simple and it's like real i really want to get in these mysteries ah but you really can't handle it so just live a christian life and it would almost seem like there's these different different things he's emphasizing and and there's i know there's those of you here that know it that there's you've sat under pastors and you've known ministries that have basically taken these statements i've shared with you about the seals and said see god doesn't want you to know it you can't understand it forget about it let that book collect dust on the shelf and thought nothing of it not realizing that what brother brandon was doing was not trying to separate the two but bring him together he kept mentioning them side by side not to create a dichotomy but to unite them together and being this fusion between whatever the seventh seal is whatever these thunders reveal whatever is behind that veil and the life that you're living whatever's hidden in your life come together and unite together it all ties to think of how it ties together the simple humble manifestation of god by living the life and he and he brings it right to revelations chapter 8 verse 1. and i i know that i'm sharing quite a bit with you and it may seem to be very compact and very dense but i believe you can digest this in revelations chapter 8 verse 1. and you won't even need an enzyme to do it revelations chapter 8 verse 1 this is the seventh seal and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour that's it that's all it says the seventh seal is hidden within this language there was silence in heaven about the space of and a half hour seven stills opened and now it's represented symbolically in this saying silence in heaven about the space of a half hour there's a lot of things that could be shared on this i think there's different ways that you can use it as uh um it may be a shadow or a type or try to use some sort of example or an allegory in a way of just trying to bring out the full truth of this and so i think it's i don't i don't want to make i would i'm always careful in the way that i express things i don't want to be so come across as so dogmatic because this is the only way you can see it period this is it this is the only way you can see it uh but because there's different ways that you could express the same truth and he says when the seventh seal opens there's silence in heaven about the space of a half hour and in the sard when brother man preaches the sardisian church age listen to this statement do i have that quote there from the sardisian church age it would be right after revelations 8 chapter 8 verse 1. i may not have put it in there so listen so this is what he says and um i can still remember the first time this really came to my conscience i heard brother lonnie jenkins share it so i can still hear it in his voice and boy did he get me back later he says and the bible says someone thought i was referring to brother michael when i said that no it happened in a men's meeting where after i had spoke he came across the next morning says well it's not exactly going to be that way and that's how he got me back so he says and the bible says that the heavens were empty for the space of a half hour now the brother branham is now he used the language the heavens were empty for a space of a half hour he's clearly referencing the open of the seventh seal revelations 8 1 and he says this statement where is this big foul of god then what an interesting question heaven is silent and he takes it and again just think of how i think it holds weight i mean there's there's something to this i'm not building some new doctrine around one little question where is this big fellow god then but it impresses the prophet to make this connection that when the heavens are silent he says the heavens are empty and he says where is the big fellow god then where's god where's this big fellow god uh-huh see he's in christ so the heavens are empty or the heavens are silent where's god he's in christ maybe we just want to debate all day well the heavens aren't empty and this is the reason why their heavens are silent but he's wanting us to think about where god is and he says he's in christ remember your life is hid with christ in god and he says where is where is the god where's this big fellow god he's in christ so now where's christ so where's this where's this big fellow god where's christ i want to know where christ is where is he at the open of the seals where is he found bringing you right up to the right up just go on and keep living a simple life and he says so we're wanting to know where christ is if god is in christ where's this big fella at the time of the seventh seal being opened well god is in christ where's christ remember the seventh seal brother said it unfolds in a three-fold manner he said did you notice at the opening of the seventh seal it's also in a three-fold mystery is what he says when brother branham describes i can't remember now just off the top my head where it was he said it was the next few services after he preached christ is the mystery god revealed he described the sermon this way pointed back to what he preached and he described it this way he preached on the threefold revelation of jesus christ being god's hidden secret from the foundation of the world so christ is the mystery god revealed the summary is it's the threefold revelation of jesus christ being god's hidden secret from the foundation of the world so there was a hidden secret a mystery of god in his heart heart purpose of god in the back part of god's mind and it unfolds in a three-part manner all through jesus christ and he says i'm trying so in christ and mr god revealed he says i'm trying to bring you the three-fold revelation or mystery of god the revel and i'll just i'm skipping through several statements now the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret and by the person of indication vindicated word by his original headship so he's trying to bring you the third threefold revelation he makes the statement the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret this is what he's preached on and christ is the mystery god revealed this is just a few several months four months or so after the preaching of the seven seals what i'm wanting to emphasize and you can see here is that christ is in his bride christ in his bride is part of the unfolding of this great threefold revelation because he said it's a three-fold revelation three-fold revelation of jesus christ revelation threefold mystery the secret and he says so notice some of these bullet points christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery now cried the first part of that threefold mystery was jesus christ fulfilling the old testament being the interpretation of the written word that's the first part that's the first uh unfolding of the threefold mystery of christ but now the next part christ in the church and that and he says taking his wife back and so we know there's a restoration to eden see the threefold mystery now listen he says it this way god manifested himself in his body christ now you see the threefold beautiful thing christ in his body the church vindicating his promised word like god did through christ threefold mystery the the the seventh seal is in a three-fold mystery this mystery of christ is in a three-fold mystery and he says it's in in his body christ now in his body the church vindicated his promised word he describes that second fold this way to have the preeminence in his bodies of believers that is his bride that he might live in people what's the second fold of the threefold mystery to have preeminence in his body of believers his bride that he might live in the people he says what's this threefold purpose manifest himself in jesus christ to come into the body by jesus christ to have the preeminences part of this three-fold mystery and he's using the same language here in the christ is a mystery god revealed now paragraph 210 and that we could look at this together he says do you get it if you fail come back to this tape again i don't know how much longer i'll be with you remember this is the truth of thus saith the lord it's the truth it's the scripture like the seven mysteries of the seven last seals the mysteries of them the seals have been broken every age come down and there they left a lot of scattering and god not willing to be scattered he comes back and picks up those things those doctrines they started and brought it out and revealed the whole thing same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of christ how he was god's threefold purpose for the church oh my letting him out reveal if i finish this series tonight i'll make reference too the very initial inspiration that struck me is how brother branham makes reference to the book being sealed and you were sealed and so you were sealed in that book with those seals and the holy spirit being held back for two thousand years but at the open of seven seals christ the holy spirit is loosed again and what did that do it loses you it it whatever is holding you back whatever's restraining you there's no reason why the anthem is only believe all things are possible this is the only age where you can actually have the the faith to believe in a body change he said what do you mean by that well it wasn't given any other age and everyone who's passed on can tell you yeah i obviously didn't have the faith right because it wasn't given for that hour in this hour you have to have more faith than ever given ever it was given any other age and that's power to change your body so he says he comes back revealing the mystery of christ how god's threefold purpose for the church oh my letting him out he says reveal that's what's happening he says like those seven mysteries the seven last seals he comes back the same thing he's doing now is revealing the mystery of christ that's the same thing he's doing now again paragraph 377 i like that three seven seven he said now he's sanctified with his spirit and blood at church that he might make every promise in the last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up these other fellows has left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the seven seals he is expressing himself well there it is all the mystery of the seven is hills he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then express himself through the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them you're only going to be the word when you let the word go through you it's got to be some process of the word going through you becoming a part of you so he wants to the threefold manner of his expression the first is expressing himself the second fold of his threefold manifestation first christ himself in christ then himself through the church becoming the word as you let the word go through you again we're this is how you're the open book paragraph 5 15. he is the first fruits of the resurrection is that right then what is he he is the head of the body which is his church bride then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery you're part of the mystery it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of god's mystery how god revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he reveals his church and raises it up by the same word it's part of his threefold mystery he's pointing to god in christ manifesting himself god declaring himself through the flesh of his son jesus christ he revealed himself in christ and raised christ up by the word so now he reveals himself in his bride and will raise her up by the same word it's part of the threefold mystery i know you've heard these things before i just want you to i want these to become more pronounced and connected with what brother brown was saying when he preached the seals and that humility that simplicity that living the life paragraph 5 29 and the word in god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message into the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden the threefold mystery of god his body like the seven mysteries of the seven last seals he said he came and he told me when he comes and takes the book he said it's the same thing he's doing now he's making this allusion to he's alluding to christ coming and taking the book in the word in the bible in the symbolic form he says the same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of christ it's the same thing in the revelation of the mystery the three-fold mystery you're a part of it you have to believe you're a part of it out there's there's those that would come along and try to make it all brother branham that this is all fulfilled in brother branham and and i believe that they've kind of gone off into a ditch and then there's some people that want to pull you out of that ditch right into another one and leave brother branham out of it but if you'll notice i'm not quoting brother long jenkins i'm quoting the message he preached i'm not quoting another another prophet another somebody else god raised up uh we're all the minister of god come back to this voice come back to this message because this is what's pointing us to these things and there's some that maybe while you i wish you didn't read so many quotes or uh maybe can't you just bring these things through the bible you know we could preach the word of god using whatever means we we have but i know whom i'm speaking to and it's important for me to at least at this time in this moment for us to become so rooted and established in what we've been taught and what we've been given because what's most important is what was delivered is translated into a lived life so he reveals his church and raises them up by the same word amen the word of god in his church today the threefold mystery of god his body now brother brahms finished the sermon and he's preaching he's coming he's beginning to sing i think it's take the name of jesus with you and he's singing this song right before he sings now the threefold great mystery of revelation has been revealed it has been threefold purpose of his great mystery of revelation has been revealed he's the main one that's the one just earlier that summer he's preaching and he makes a reference he says i'm going to be preaching on the threefold i think he says the threefold revelation he says i've worked out the first one and he says i'm working on the second one now bringing all the scriptures out and he says now the threefold purpose is great mystery revelation has been revealed he's the main one that's the one he says it's the revelation it says eternal is god's word is eternal it's at the end of the service while the worship is going on but the threefold purpose of god's great mystery is revealed god manifested in christ christ manifests in the church we look back historically to see god manifested in christ but now it's the same god or the same christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost eve back to the original condition the garden eden there's your three-fold purpose several paragraphs later in paragraph 6 35 the threefold revelation hope and joy of heaven revealed in him and he sings precious name oh how sweet hope of earth and joy says what the hope of earth and joy of heaven what a beautiful visual at this very time of the third pole this great union of heaven and earth coming together hope of earth and joy of heaven everything is manifested in christ god the church everything else is manifest in christ the bible is christ the bible is the written word which he is the word it's manifestation what the written word its manifestation is the evidence of the life coming into the flesh of the word to manifest it oh isn't it wonderful do you realize just how closely this language fits with what he's preaching in the seventh seal and the things he's alluding to in the question and answers on the seals the bible is christ the bible is the written word but the manifestation of it is the evidence of the life coming in the flesh of the word to manifest the evidence of the written word is life coming into the flesh to manifest the word now you see how the bible became a new book when the seals were opened not so much becoming a new book because when you read it you see it differently but when you receive it you live it differently when it becomes a new book now the whole truth of it's being unveiled now the seals are tore off of it the life is being loosed under it now now now there's a life that's resonant in the body if you could kind of maybe catch it in this way you'll realize that um the the it it's always pointing to the rapture and so the life as it had moved through the carriers as it moved to the church age they always experienced what revival death revival death now at the open the seals we're snatched from death to life there will be no other cycle this is it so the opening seals makes the bible a new book the it's the fulfilling of the word of god in the last days the bible's christ the bible's the written word now it's christ in his bride fulfilling and living out this written word so i'll close with this statement i don't have it first slide i want you just to uh listen to these words i've read the statement for christ the mystery at the very beginning where he says all that's in the book is the believer he says now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed so now he's looking right at revelations 5 and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb now can we get the image then of revelations 5 and the lamb coming to take the book and yes we're all i think we're all familiar with just such significant strong language is used of that event what it signifies and whether you're looking at the breach or sirs is this the time and what it would have meant to the prophet and what it symbolized and stood for as he neared that great event and now we're hearing him at in the time in the season of these things transpiring and how he's he's taking in the magnitude of these things but he says do you see the seals i feel like this is all building this is all building to this do you see the sills and so he walks us to the paces he was through in this mediatorial work but someday he comes to get this book and he's walking through revelations chapter five it's that open book in five that comes down in revelations 10 it says in one place revelations 5 comes to revelations 10 7. and so he says all that's in that book he come forth this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world do you have it in the image now what's happening when he was slain islam and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there it's a taking of the book it's a loosing of the seals it's the bible becoming a new book and don't get weird be a christian do what is right honor one another live for god live clean live pure become more zealous for truth you think all these seals are open these seals are open these are great mysteries the bibles become a new book then live a new life live close to god desire to see souls saved live above the things of the world because that's the interpretation of the word of god in this last days if you're ever going to triumph over death you're going to start walking in the word of god and you've been given power to bind him death the greatest therefore all the way to the least let's stand today
