TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our gracious heavenly father we're so uh uplifted today by the worship lord we're encouraged by your presence that is with us and lord we pray that as you have been faithful to inhabit these praises to honor your word that where two or three are gathered in your name you are in our midst we ask now father that you would come and break the bread of life to us lord if we were to pull each heart we could give different reasons as to why we're here different paths to get here different experiences that have brought us to this place we could even have different expectations this morning different prayers different hurts and different wants but lord the reality is at the end of the day at the end of the analysis once all the polling is done and all the questions are asked and all the pathways are examined all the needs and wants are placed before you the reality is father it all meets in you lord everything that we have need of is in you everything that we desire is only satisfied in you lord even our pathway today to be to this place experiences needs and wants and desires that have led to this moment it's led to you so now father with this understanding that the supernatural sets before us we humble ourselves to hear from you we ask that you take control of this service for your glory lord rightly divide the word of truth to our hearts and may we all now father just purpose in our hearts to join in together in this service knowing that it'll be beneficial for us but also father realizing that you could have a very specific message for one person and if it were to lighten the load or to deliver strength and encourage save a soul lord it's worth every effort so father we surrender ourselves to you now praying that you take control of this service for your glory we praise your name we bless you bless your people father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen if you could take your bibles and turn to genesis chapter 2. we're going to read one verse there genesis chapter 2 verse 18. genesis chapter 2 verse 18. and it says and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him so short i'd like just to read it again this is my emphasis or my inspiration is uh solely from this verse and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him amen you may be seated i'll give the the disclaimer right off the bat this is going to be very very simple and very focused and i was extremely directed to this particular subject and i feel that i couldn't get away from it so i wanted just to approach it and as i thought about it in my heart in terms of what the the emphasis was from the spirit or what the lord was dealing with me in my heart what my burden was i felt that it certainly at the very minimum it should encourage us or inspire us to greater brotherly kindness and to have a deeper empathy for others being able to relate to them and understand how god has made man and the different circumstances one might be in and also i believe it would be a comfort and an encouragement or health to those who are searching for healing maybe a sense of belonging or just even understand themselves and how that there's a need deep within man that god wants to meet and uh sometimes we're not even mindful of the forces that drive us or the things that influence us and so i want to be very focused and very specific today yet very simple on the subject still continue on the family but the subject that the lord's been dealing with me on this past week was loneliness and if you just want to look at verse 18 again it says in the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him and so we've looked at how already how a picture of god is unfolding in the beginning god created and we've arrived to this expression of a family and this was god's the momentum of god from the beginning was leading to this particular expression and this expression of male and female the expression of man and woman the embodiment of husband and wife and the family were an expression of god so it was actually god's desire and even the person of god that was being expressed in this image we see of the masterpiece family and adam and the woman but i want to look at this statement uh it's kind of taking a step back before this expression further unfolds he says it is not good that the man should be alone this is a very striking statement as god actually vocalizes his sentiment god is giving his opinion or his judgment about something we look back through the scripture and we see that god to this point had spoken to create he had spoken to bless or to command and the scripture expresses that god saw that it was good so it was giving us insight to god's sentiment and so god would speak and something would be or god would bless or command and it would be so or that would be a blessing upon the creation and then it said god saw that it was good so it gives us insight to what god is thinking what his opinion and judgment is but here god declares something and it's the first declarative statement if i could use it that way that discloses how he's feeling or what he's thinking or his opinion or judgment of creation and it's not uh it's not rosy or flowery as you might think this is great attaboy everything's looking wonderful but he says it is not good that man should be alone so first time god speaks in terms of not commanding not blessing not creating but god is just speaking his sentiment or his judgment about his creation and it is it is not good that man should be alone that means i thought it was interesting that the hebrew word is bad it is not good that man should be bad and so it's bad to be alone in other words is what god was saying but it means to be by itself or to be besides to be separate from and it comes from the root to withdrawal to separate or to be isolated and so god looks at man and he identifies he expresses this sentiment this is not good for man to be alone and it's the feeling of being forsaken it's the feeling of feeling it's a feeling of missing out or feeling like you don't belong you don't fit in and and seeing something something expressed or something identified and you yourself not having the same companionship or the same camaraderie or fellowship and god places this of this expression it is not good for man to be alone in verses 19 and 20 it says in the lord god command cause to grow out of the ground all the beasts of the field and and adam was commissioned to go and name all the beasts and all the cattle and all the fowls of the air and it says at the end of verse 20 is adam was naming everything it says and there was not found a help meet for him now this this what we would have seen is adam would have named all the animals and named all creatures he would have seen male female male female he would have seen that there was companionship there was multiples of these creation it wasn't just singular it wasn't just one so adam would have even would have been been viewed differently than the rest of creation and perhaps himself maybe he was feeling like hey wait a minute everybody else has got a friend everybody else has got a crew i'm the only one you know i don't have anybody to hang out with i don't have anybody who's like me i don't have he saw something expressed in creation that he himself would have felt a loneliness and emptiness maybe something a feeling of being forsaken and so god looks at it and he expresses the same sentiment not because he's kind of guessing what adam felt but he's empathetic because god is the lonely god dwelt alone dwelt by himself no contemporary no equal none that would that could enter into fellowship and harmony with god completely and so loneliness is the first thing that god declares is not good and if you look at verse 17 how it says it speaks of eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil it says the day that you eat it that day you'll die it suggests that loneliness is second only to death uh because he says hey if you eat this you're gonna die and it's not good for man to be alone it creates maybe a hierarchy of the worst things one to die number two to be alone and maybe the worst would be to die alone but he's expressing these things and i think it's just very uh it was very striking to me there's there's different levels that we could express it in and i want to be very specific as i said the man could not be alone or should not be alone in order to fulfill the commandment he was under in order to be fruitful and multiply there had to be female there had to be an expression of this gender in order for him to fulfill his commission to bring forth to be fruitful multiply and then also to replenish and subdue the earth it was something that would be done together as a family as a couple as husband and wife but there's more that's meant in god's conviction of a man's need and necessity for companionship it's not well man can't get the job done without the woman but it spoke deeply to something about the man when he says it is not good for man to be alone it's not good for man to be only himself and since it's not good for men to be only himself i will make a counterpart of himself i will make a help like himself and and i want to get into more of what this word help me means but before exploring who this help me is this one who is like him to help him i want to consider the premise upon which god bases the expression of the woman in other words god just does not say and he caused adam to go into a deep sleep and he took out took a rib and he he brought forth a woman made he a woman and closed up the flesh thereof and brought the woman unto the man he says that he gives this expression this utterance before he does it so it's the very premise it's part of his inspiration it's part of his reasoning and as to why man needs the woman he says it is not good for men to be alone so i will make him to help me so i don't i want to look at that foundation of that premise even god's justification for creating the woman because god reveals something about our nature as humans we say well that was true about adam in genesis chapter two well it's still true about man today and so not only is he revealing something about our nature as all nature as humans but he's showing us his divine nature it was something that god could relate to it's something that god uh shared an affinity with adam in that regards so it speaks about something in god's divine nature but also his desire for us uh um it wasn't god just remarking look at that guy he's all alone but it was god saying i know this is not good i know how he feels there's something about the man and the way that i made him and and so god can relate to that so it reveals something about god and it also shows that god has a desire for us to meet the needs that we have and in a simple way we can say that god created the man as a social creature more than any of the other animals even though we would see that a serpent was an upright beast that could talk he created the man to be a social creature and i want to make some of these statements in the beginning though i i could see how they might be more appropriate at the end but the full the full maturity of adam the full expression of who he was and all that he could be required help required companionship it was it was necessary that the woman come forth and this is true of adam and it holds true today our full character uh the potential that we have within us cannot be developed just by solo labor you can't just go at it alone you can't just do it by yourself you can't you're not just set off on your own and being by yourself and being alone and doing all on your there's no way that the full potential of your being the everything that you're to accomplish and even your full character cannot be developed by just working by yourself and and i don't mean just being self-employed or being a solo practitioner but anybody who is who's in a trade where they work by themselves really there's an upside to it and there's a downside to it being a solo practitioner you you don't have the the um the exchange and the counseling and the the checks and balances and so there's an upside to those things there's a downside to it but i'm looking about in life in life and who you are and who god wants you to be and the fullness of your potential and your full character cannot be developed just working on your own or going at it alone because we we realize that solitude is important to an individual prayer meditation getting alone but we cannot correctly grow in mere solitude and i mean i think you could probably get some real hearty amens at this thought loneliness cannot produce a full life loneliness cannot cannot produce proper service what we're called to do and so i would place it in this context as we're examining the subject of it is not good for man to be alone the perfection of our character requires the responsibilities as a family member responsibilities we have as a family member the perfection of our character required this responsibility that is borne by the fact that you are a son or a daughter perfection of our character requires the responsibilities that you hold as a spouse or as a parent and is through those relationships that our character is perfected and so we're the perfection of our character is impossible without friendships it's impossible without without the relationship as an employer or employee or or neighbor or a citizen all those relationships that we share with others between people or among people are necessary for the perfection of our character be very very difficult to make the argument that a man had perfect character and he loved his wife and was upright but he was a horrible neighbor right or he was he was a horrible citizen didn't pay his taxes cheated everybody in government and things you think well this is there's something incongruent so it's the whole picture it's more than just being good at one thing but it's developing into the person that god would want you to be and so true happiness or even personal fulfillment joyfulness is found in proper relationships true happiness and fulfillment in life is found in healthy relationships in with family and friends and i might just refer to it as relationships and suggesting that this in family relationships and it's in friendships but really it's uh it's just in these strong relationships reveal character it promotes character it helps our character and and it really promotes the fullness of life to be in a position to live for somebody else it says in ecclesiastes chapter 4 verses 8 to 12 it says there is one alone and there is not a second so the preacher here as it is mentioned is giving us a picture that he as he views something he sees one man he sees them all by himself there's not another person and this is his conclusion he have neither child nor brother yet there's no end of all his labor neither is his eyes satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom do i labor and bereave my soul of good this is also vanity yea it is sore travail for a man to be by himself with no no other relationships no child or brother no heir and and continues to labor continues to work and accumulate wealth he's saying and never has the thought of the question of who am i doing this for who who is this going to be left to he's making this statement that this is vanity this is sore travail this is no way to live what what reward is there if a man labors and accumulates riches but has no one to share it with uh where's the where's the real unction and inspiration to do something and do something right if you're not doing it for someone else then if i just work alone and i just i get a paycheck and and all i do is i deposit into a bank and i and i can't live long enough to spend all of it it's just for you the writer is saying this is vanity and he's also saying that this is something that really would be a labor and a bereavement to one's soul to not be able to share the fruits of his labor and so he continues to or better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow there's each one of these principles could be expounded upon or amplified in great detail two are better than one it is not good for man to be alone it is not good for a man to not have companionship or one laboring together with him and he says when there's two there's a greater reward for your labor you say well i want the whole paycheck i don't want to share it well the scripture is saying that if you work and you have fruits of your labor it's a greater reward to be able to share it he says for if they fall and then he gets into the other elements of this if you fall there's one to lift you up a man working by himself when he makes a mistake when he falls when when his labor is singular when his reward is only shared with himself there's not one there to lift him up when he falls down but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken i i'd love to maybe spend more time on each one of those principles but in one sense i would say this that really what's lifted up to us when we read this is the beauty and strength of family and friends the beauty and strength of having somebody with you and somebody by your side and somebody to labor with you someone who can be there when you fall down and someone who can warm you when you're cold and someone who could fight with you when you have somebody attacking you and so it's really lifting up the beauty and strength of relationships but what what it uses to do so is the contrast of the emptiness of loneliness and the downside of being yourself so it creates a picture on one hand he's painted a beautiful picture but he's having to use some ugly colors to do it to get this to understand that on one hand when you're just one and you're all alone when you fall you can't pick yourself up when you're prevailed against you have no one to fight with you when you lay alone you have no heat and uses all these different examples just to kind of state the obvious we say yep you know what that's right it's not good being alone and so with with um these things kind of just all being foundational maybe very simple i still want to try to maybe move forward a little bit in this but this is a human need this isn't not this isn't just what christians need this isn't just what uh what certain types of people need this is a human need across humanity and it was inherent in the man that god had created that when god had created him the first sentiment and judgment man god gives about him is that it's not good for him to be alone so this was something that was inherent in man this was not the result of his of something he had done this was not something as a result of something adam had said or something he had been exposed to well you've just been online watching too many movies that's why you feel lonely god said hey this is inherent in the man that i created this is something about him this is a human need now i want to kind of give a little bit of a caveat here this does not suggest that any companion or any crowd satisfies our need for relationship god didn't say it's not good for man to be alone just find someone to hang out with find something to call a friend even if it's a volleyball and you call him wilson you just need somebody there was more to it it had to have a deeper connection a deeper expression and so he was not just it's not let's not take from this well i just need somebody and i don't want to be alone so i want to find something uh there's a real caution in that because it's a human need but since it's such a important need you have to be very careful how you satisfy it because relationships can be harmful amen i'm amen and myself now relationships can we call them today toxic and it's about time we found a proper word for it and we say well i don't like that person they're unfriendly i don't like the way they make me feel and after a while we finally figured out you know what that's called it's called toxic it's corrode it corrodes your your attitude and your spirit and it harms you and it hurts you and i was pondering it and i and i realized that this is maybe one way i'll put it now god's answer to adam's loneliness was a help me not a cellmate it was somebody that they were that he could work to get someone that would understand him someone that he would enjoy the company of and not just somebody he was stuck together with and so there there's more to it than just having a crew there's more to it than just having people you hang out with it's more than just having one thing in common and we all like to get together at this at this restaurant to watch the buccaneers play because we're all buccaneers fan it's the only thing you have in common it's more to it than that in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners and it's a it's a statement i guess that uh may seem a little bit cryptic like the talking bad will corrupt whether or not you you know know where to put the fork on which side of the plate and things like that but it means bad company corrupt corrupts morality evil communication corrupts good manners and the the manners there is ethos it's a moral character the state of being so bad company ruins your ethos i thought about this and just what that really meant and you think about it maybe that's a word that might not be very familiar but it ruins your sentiments it ruins your nature it ruins who you are it perverts it it distorts it so bad company the wrong kind of relationships the wrong kind of friendships the wrong kind of uh conversations or interactions in relationships corrupt your character and corrupt who you are your sentiments your nature your opinions your judgments your ethos and so relationships that weaken or discourage us are not a support i mean i could get an amen or a duh right it's very very obvious but i want you to ponder this a relationship that uh that discourage you a weight relationship that brings you down is not a compliment or a help because god in the beginning gave adam a help me this helped me was one who supports one who aids him one who helps him one that's complementary so true relationship is one that is supposed to be complementary a true relationship is one that strengthens you any relationship that weakens you and tears you down and belittles you or makes you feel uh unimportant or oppressed in any way is not the kind of relationship that god says man needs he says it's not good for men to be alone hey just get you one even if they're horrible and abusive just get you and that's not what god is saying because those kind of relationships that oppress us that are controlling or demeaning are not complementary relationships why because unhealthy relationships do not cultivate the best in you they bring out the worst in you they're not the ones that provoke your good instincts they're not the ones that emphasize uh what's best for you and listen since we're all family here and nobody knows who we're talking about we've seen relationships we think that person they married doesn't balance them out the right way so they're both exactly the same they're both they're both lazy so they always sleep in he needed somebody that would get up at six in the morning get him out of bed right or he's completely clueless he really needed to marry a wife that was very sensitive because when they're both clueless it's like double the trouble and we've we've seen that before in relationships where it's like man there needed to be some balancing there and it's not that the the opposites and he's he's mean and she's sweet the kind of attraction that we talk about the good and the bad but the complimentary i think that's really what what should be meant when we say opposite attracts as well that guy's a liar and she's truthful and they really love each other but one that's complementary to you that's how relationships ought to be complementary supportive and so unhealthy relationships don't bring out the best in you and don't help you with your weaknesses what typically happens in unhealthy relationships is they put you down or they bind your best they hold it back unhealthy relationships are usually characterized by one feeling threatened by the best in you so they want to undermine it and destroy it and weaken it and defile it or pervert it and keep it covered up and it causes you to question your worth it causes you to question your value and so relationships that do that are often manipulative abusive controlling and and it's not this it's more of a dependency uh maybe it's characterized a lot of times in teenage love where one you're infatuated with the other person what does it read jealousy controlling where were you i just went to the bathroom you were gone for five seconds now just to express it in the sense that because there's uh there's other ways that relationships are good for us not just in a complementary sense but in a sense that it challenges us relationships that challenge us or convict us or hold us accountable we should not consider them unhelpful or unsupportive those are the kind you need you need the kind of friendships that that bring a conviction or or encourage you to do better ones that will hold us accountable ones that will challenge us not ones that control us and put us down but ones that are willing to get beneath us and help us in our weakness and in our inefficiencies and the things that we don't do well so just because a relationship challenges us just because a relationship says hey you shouldn't have done that you should say you're sorry doesn't mean well you're toxic i don't have anything to do with you i can't lie and get away with it so there's a there's a there's a health to a relationship that can even be challenging sometimes make us feel like well i didn't do right i didn't do the right thing that's the kind of relationship that can be complementary and those are the kind of relationships that can be helpful in proverbs chapter 27 verses 9 and 10 we'll skip a little bit before we get to verse 10. but verse 9 proverbs chapter 27 verse 9 ointment and perfume rejoice the heart there's your justification for buying perfume doesn't say anything i guess a cologne could be an ointment does doterra use this phrase or young living ointment and perfume perfume rejoice the heart so does the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel and so today we're a little bit too macho to call it the sweetness of a man's friend uh but it the scriptures speak in a particular sentiment that's very wonderful the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel rejoices the heart speaks of the beauty of a true friendship a true relationship where there's hearty counsel sincere advice from the heart that when someone's honest with you and they're sincere and they share something with you it rejoices your heart to hear it when it's honest when it's sincere when it's not manipulative when it's not selfish right it rejoices someone it feels good to know that someone opens up to you and shares something to you and the scripture certainly suggests that it can be something that's very direct something very open very frank but it's something that rejoices a man's heart just as an ointment or perfume a man when he has a friend who by hearty counsel on his counsel can share things with them and sentiments to him it's a sweetness to the man in proverbs chapter 27 verse 6 just going a few verses back it says this faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful i talk about how this the the open rebuke is better than secret love and it says that a faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful it's a friend that you can trust to be honest even if it's going to hurt a little bit faithful are the wounds of a friend it's it's better to have a friend that will be honest with you and even the wounding and the hurting and the defense that may be caused in sharing it it's better than the vain flattery why because the friend is honest with you to help you but the the kisses of an enemy have selfish motive behind them sure you've heard it before there's a difference between a leader and a manipulator a leader encourages teach encourages you teaches you guides you so the in the journey and the results of the leadership and the guiding accomplishes something for your benefit because jesus says the student shall be as his master he says no one's greater than the teacher no one's greater than the master but through teaching instruction and discipline the master's objective is that the student would become as the master that's a leader but a manipulator wants to control you for his own benefit and do it in such a way to where you can never be as him you'll always need them this is exposes toxic leadership styles and so the scripture speaks to it and says it's better to have a friend who'll be honest with you this is a faithful wound who will open up their heart and be honest even if it hurts than the lies of an enemy that's just vain flattery to puff you up to control you or to get you to do something for their benefit and so these true relationships with family with friends are to be treasured and valued they should not be taken lightly and and they're ones that when you have them you don't have very many of them and so continuing in verse 10 of proverbs 27 it says thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake not that shows just how powerful friendship is if your if your father had a friend who the sweetness of it rejoiced his heart by hearty counsel if your father had a friend who was faithful to him and was honest with him and one that stuck with them he said if your father had a friend like that don't abandon him that's how powerful and important these true relationships are that you would give reverence and respect to the relationship that your father had in a friendship that your parent had because that's how valuable these things are so he says don't forsake your own friend don't forsake your father's friend don't abandon true friends then it says neither go unto thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity and it's it's it's kind of just odd construction i i know that i meditated on prayed on it studied it and in times past you look at this and try to understand what's the scripture saying but it's saying that true friendships are to be valued don't abandon don't forsake don't be distant from your friends maintain those relationships your father's friend forsake not and don't be distant and aloof and all by yourself then when you need help you show up says exactly says neither going to thy brother's house on the day of the calamity don't be distant and uninvolved and only show up when you need help hey brother you're a brother right you know we're family family sticks together it's like where have you been family sticks together do you want to give me my car back you borrowed five years ago is that why you're here i haven't seen you since you went out to get milk and never came back and but now when you need help oh you need more milk and that's what the scripture's speaking about that that don't just be distant aloof don't be somebody who's only there and wants to make the promote the relationship and be friendly and be kind when you need something and i'm sure you've all said it maybe you've already said it in 2021 okay what do you want you can just tell by the way they're treating you that they they're about to ask a favor you never call me what do you want that's the human nature proverbs is dealing with and then it makes the statement to me that just opens the door in a beautiful way for better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off so he's saying stick close to true friends true friendships and he uses this contrasting example of how you can have true friendships and then the brother that shows up whenever he needs help that your friends have been there through thick and thin your friends have been there for you value those don't forsake them and then your brother shows up whenever he needs help and he's just pointing out the fact that the ties of blood may be less reliable than those of true friendship it's not saying that we ought to disdain them or we ought to weaken them or we ought to forsake our brother but rather it's saying that there's a there is better is a neighbor who is close in heart better as a neighbor who's there with you in spirit than one a family member whose heart is distant from you and we've we can experience this in life that our family oftentimes will let us down but our friends don't or certain friends don't he's saying that the the loyalty of blood and the affinity that family ought to have each other says this has been corrupted these standards have been broken the the way that even you look at the old testament how the scripture was written in the laws in israel how that a brother would look after his brother's family and have obligations to his wife and to his children why because that's what family did but now the proverbs begin to speak how this this understanding and this offended in this closeness and the real meaning of family is getting watered down and so there's friends that are there for you and that there's ties of friendship and affinity and there's a neighbor who's closer in heart closer in spirit and nearer to you to help you than the family member whose heart is distant from you who's not caring or supportive or empathetic of what you're going through proverbs chapter 18 verse 24 and again i'm i'm using what i'm doing in case you haven't figured it out what i'm trying to do is highlight with other scriptures what god said about man in the beginning he said it's not good for man to be alone these scriptures in ecclesiastes and corinthians and proverbs 27 and 18 and 17 different places we'll read is is just later on expressing the dynamics of the different facets of how it's not good for man to be alone and what this togetherness and relationships are accomplishing for the man this is what god saw in the beginning proverbs 18 24 says a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother this is uh i i wanted to i was going to say a misunderstood scripture but maybe we could just say it's interpreted differently and we most often read this that if you want to have friends be friendly now that's true right if you want to have friends be friendly and that's how this scripture is often uh interpreted or expressed is that a man who hath friends must show himself friendly but in the language that's used and a lot of other some other translations actually render it this way even in other languages that it it speaks it this way it's touching on the danger of someone wanting to have a lot of friends because if a man wants to have a lot of friends if a man is going to have friends and speaks of a multitude of friends or a lot of friends then he's got to show himself friendly and so there's a danger in having a lot of shallow friendships there's a danger in even the weakened bond of family and saying the man with too many friends is only increasing the chances that he will be hurt broken or used by those friendships because a man who wants to have a lot of friends has got to be really friendly and so it can get to where it's more surface you want to be friendly you want to have friends hey i'll treat you to dinner hey i'll do this let's do that and you want to be the guy hey hey hey you know everybody's great everybody's friendly hey how's it going i remember your name hey let's go out to lunch hey i'll get your lunch hey i like those shoes where did you get those shoes i tell you what i'm going to buy another pair i'm going to get you one in brown and it's like this kind of he just wants to be a buddy wants to be a friend they say a man who wants friends a man who has a lot of friends to meet the need of companionship and friendship is making himself vulnerable to be used because he's spreading himself so thin and it's so many shallow relationships the chances are you're going to be taken advantage of you're going to be used you're going to be let down you're going to be rejected why because a man wants to be friendly wants to have a lot of friends so it's touching on on the danger of not having true meaningful connections with people a man that have friends must show himself friendly so it kind of raises this specter of a man with many friends is in danger of ruin but that says there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother there's you can have a lot of friends and a lot of shallow friendships and those friends most likely will not be there for you when you need them but a real friend though he may not be many he sticketh closer than a brother he had he tears to you clings joins to stay close by you sticks closer than a brother the many friends the man who have friends plural must show himself friendly those friends may forsake you when it's convenient for them or when it's inconvenient for you but there's a friend whose loyalty and faithfulness is made known when it counts so you can take this man who has many friends he may have many friends and he showed himself friendly but then something happens and in a time of need and when he's in trouble all the many friends begin to run away but there's that one friend that starts running in there's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother there's a friend who the real value of that friendship is made known when it counts in uncertain times in times of calamity or different difficulty the genuine friend is the one that reveals himself they're the ones that stick sticks their neck out they're the ones that calls they're the ones that say what can i do to help they're the ones that says i know this doesn't look good this is a pretty nasty situation let's figure this out the bible says in proverbs 17 17 and it's uh i was just looking at all these scriptures last week and i was in my mind i was putting them in categories and i felt you know if this was a puzzle none of these pieces would fit and and and i just realized that the real the what made the pieces fit is there's a true image of a brother and there's a true image of a friend but then the false the the failure of a brother um is is contrasted by the success of a true friend the value of a true friend and so it's it's not to suggest that in the end friendship is better than family but that when something fails to meet expectations when something fails to meet its purpose into what it's suited for that's when you really value the true relationships that god gives you because this says a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity now i want to say this at the outset as i read this a true friend becomes a brother during the time of trouble and i'll try to express it because it's pointing to to relationships and even the failure of family duty and so the bible's making a distinction among different types of relationships you could say a man who has many friends has shallow friends or just has as buddies or has people he knows or acquaintances but then there's friends that are real genuine friends and so it's giving you these categories of people these kind of acquaintances people are at arm's length they won't be there for you when you need them necessarily and that's not a judgment on them it doesn't have to be a judgment on them but you're saying these true friends they can be there for you and listen this isn't td jake's theory on three kinds of friendship by the way you know try to avoid that but it's just scripture pointing out there's different types of relationships he says a friend loveth at all times a real friend's gonna love you through good and bad through thick and thin so it says a friend a true friend loves at all times things are going bad they love you things are going good they love you but it says a brother is born for adverse in other words a brother's love is especially known when things are bad friend loves you when things are good a friend loves you when they're bad but this kind of brotherly love is something that really manifests when things go wrong and this is how a friend can be one that sticks closer than a brother and so there's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother because a brother has a duty and when a friend fulfills the duty that even a brother has and the brother doesn't that's the friend that sticketh closer than a brother she even catch the true purpose of a family it says a brother is born for adversity how many have ever quoted this saying friends love me at all times but my sibling was born for fighting has anyone quoted it that way before i've i've heard it quoted that way i think i've probably quoted that way before friends love you at all times but brothers are born for or for strife and they're born for adversity and you're born fighting you're born disagreeing it's the sibling rivalry and they found that for children and toddlers and even into adolescence they learn at a very early age that they can treat their sibling any way they want and they're still there they don't go away i took the toy away from them and they they still force him to play with me i wake up in the morning they're still there at breakfast and they think i can say whatever do whatever i want cheat lie still take grab do it a punch kick and they still have to be my friend and then they try it at school and that person never talks to him anymore and they realize okay well i can't do this to everybody not everybody's like this guy at home who i can't get rid of and that's why sibling rivalry and the way siblings can treat each other sometimes worse than the way they treat other people because there's the consequence there's real consequence in the real world mom and dad are going to force you to be best friends you're all wearing gingham this morning to church i don't care if you don't want to look like your brother right you're forced to do it oh great they're all wearing gingham today bad bad timing so a brother is born for a diversity it means a brother is born think about how powerful this he's brought into this world for hard times not to cause him but to be there for you during it that god gives you that brother one that is born you can say even a son in the family is born god can say well it's not good that he doesn't have a brother he should have a brother why because the brother is born for hard times this is by god's design this is this is a brother's purpose a brother's purpose you want to have a you want to know what you're meant for jack you want to know what you're meant for press do you want to know what a brother's purpose is you're there to be there for your siblings you're there to be there for your sister you're there to be there for your brothers a brother's purpose is to help your your family when they need it and you say well what about me well that's what they're there for for you this is part of god's design a brother is born for adversity he's born for the hard times his very purpose is fulfilled that when you need help he's there to help you if a brother forsakes an adversity then he does not fulfill the purpose for which he was born into this world that's exactly what the scripture is saying a brother is born so that he would be there for you when you need him and so a brother who's not there when you need him has not fulfilled his purpose for being born now some of you young people if you're creative you can use this to your advantage in the next week in genesis chapter 4 verse and the lord said unto cain well maybe we could give a little bit of background cain just killed his brother and then god comes to cain and he says where is abel thy brethren and now notice how cain in this uh mode of self-justification and guilt says i know not so he lied and he says am i my brother's keeper and i was wondering is this the first instance of gaslighting i mean like the way that he he comes off at god is pretty uh pretty bold i don't know are you crazy what am i supposed to look after my brother and it's kind of like well yeah what are you asking me that that way for like i'm crazy for thinking you should have looked after your brother i'm crazy for knowing that you murdered your brother and he says i i don't know where he is am i my brother's people am i responsible to look after my brother am i responsible to protect and care for him listen the question's not answered but you should know that when cain asked this he asked it very dishonestly because by virtue of birth he had an obligation to his brother to protect him and care for him he certainly should not have killed him right we maybe we can all agree on that but the point i would really like you to to understand and let it hit you and be in heart a brother is born for a difficult time a brother is born for the times when you need somebody to be by you even if it's just their presence their conscious presence to be standing there by you saying hey i'm with you you got a job to do i'm here hey i can't help you but i just want you to know i'm right here with you and just the moral support that can be there the knowing that there's there's there's no judgment coming and even if there's a difference opinion like man i would have never done it that way but hey don't worry about i'm here buddy i'm here to help you cain had that responsibility he says am i my brother's keeper yes you are you are his keeper you are tasked with looking out after him your task that that making sure you protect him and care for him because the family was structured to look out after every member the family unit was one in which all the members would feel safe it was one in which all the members would feel you useful it was one in which all were cared for emotionally and physically it was something that the family the household was to do they were kept safe they were protected from elements protected from assailants all those different things they were cared for not just physically but also emotionally that's what family meant and was meant to be in the beginning and so when it says that god gave adam a help me god gave the man someone who is like him to help him considering god's divine purpose for him he gave it to him to meet a need and brother brandon makes a statement in the sermon the law having a shadow and he's describing just how beautiful the woman was and how strong and handsome adam would have been and there's there's some there would maybe be differences in terms of what what you would consider beautiful and what uh you would uh how you would describe the man and how you would describe the woman but he was i believe in one place he's making reference to how an artist drew adam and the woman up is the most horrible ugly awful looking creatures and the point was no these would have been beautiful specimens and and beautiful not in a worldly sense but just in in a god-given beauty and a natural beauty there would have been a radiance to them and so brother graham's describing this woman coming forth and we know the bible says and he brought her unto the man he says when adam looked at her listen to this statement when adam looked at her it put such a shock that still lives in mankind when this beautiful woman was first seen by the man it's as if something it something shocked him and now something in his dna something in his nature has now been triggered something has happened within the man he says and it still lives in mankind today before that adam would have never known those feelings before that adam would have never been able to understand those feelings if he had them before that adam would have never been able to imagine or have be conscious of certain certain things but now when he sees the woman it puts a shock in not just adam but mankind if you could even look at it these two i'd like to say omnipotence but these two pieces of this beautiful picture being introduced together there's something that was imprint that was left in humanity there was something that shook and reverberated both in man and woman that that still resides within humanity today and i would say that it speaks to a man's attraction for a woman that's the way that god it was done that's how it happened in the beginning that's the shock that was within humanity in the beginning and it speaks to that but it's not just the attraction to the woman that still resides within mankind today but it was a need it put such a shock that still lives in mankind today it was the kind of shock that when man was struck with this image he could never be the same alone again it was a shock to which now he knew he needed true family now he knew he needed friendship now he knew he needed companionship adam could have never gone back to the way it was before because of this need and it's because of that need you see that adam does not abandon his wife because in the beginning the malachi says why did he just make one one man one woman and it speaks on the subject of marriage and divorce it's because when adam when his wife failed or when she sinned against him he did not have another one that he could take there was only one so his need for companionship his need for harmony his need for satisfaction could only be met through redemption so we act to redeem her from his need to have her listen pride is is such a filthy nasty thing to where we don't want to admit that we're vulnerable we don't want to admit that we're needy we don't want to admit that we i i need you i can't live without you and sometimes we gotta kind of want to posture a little bit say hey babe i don't need you i i i i can make a living in a better one without you and we may not put it in those crude terms but sometimes we can act and live in such a way to where it's like hey i'm the man i'm the one that brings home the bacon i'm the one that bought the house i'm the one that makes the car payment i i i could get rid of you tomorrow and i could pay someone to to come clean my house and wash my clothes ever heard of uber eats babe i can eat three meals a day i don't need you right and we don't want to admit the truth is honey i need you god didn't make me to live without you maybe i could look this way and say it god didn't make me to live without you if he wanted me to live alone then i would see this pattern in scripture that this is the way that god placed it this is the way that god desired it to be now maybe someone said well what about paul when he said you know there's a pretty good scriptural argument that paul may have been a widower because for him to have taken those places he did at the sanhedrin the requirements were to be married so we can debate that all day long if you want to use paul saying i would that you'd be like me but it's the sum this shock that mankind felt is still deep within us what is it it's a longing to fit in it's a longing to be understood it's a longing to be loved it's a longing to belong to feel whole at that moment when adam saw the woman this shock that reverberated within him that still is exists within mankind there's basically adam could never feel complete if she left god said just took her away and he'd be like wait a minute what just happened and god's like oh nothing it was it was beta we want to go back we want to try that again we're not ready to roll this out it's not for public distribution yet and he's starting adam's like wait a minute i'll take the beta i mean what are you doing i can't i can't live with i can't i can't ever be the same after that moment and he would have been chasing that his entire life like wait a minute wait a minute and this is something that happens to all it still resides deep within mankind adam would have never felt whole if the woman disappeared there's a feeling of completeness to be needed even to be useful and it's so essential and so necessary that god promises to meet that need himself this is what's beautiful it's so essential and so necessary that god acknowledges that through circumstances and because of the and because of sin that one could be in a situation to where they are deprived of children they're deprived of companionship they're deprived of a spouse and god says this is so necessary for one to feel whole and complete that i will promise that i will give you that satisfaction through myself and then the real beauty of it is he says he brings it to the manner in which he most often does it himself is he does it through relationships he says you you need a brother i'll be your brother how lord i'm going to give you a friend you need a family i'll be your family how lord i'll give you one psalm 68 verses 5 and 6. we mentioned this in the last few services and so if you feel like you've already got it figured out you can kind of check out for a few minutes but psalm 68 verses 5 and 6 this is god speaking of god as it says at the end of this first verse a father of the fatherless and the judge of the widows is god in his holy habitation i want to read verse 6 as well god saideth the solitary families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land so it says the kind of the the the center of this this will of the father the followers judge of the widows set of solitary families brings out those that are bound with chains kind of the center of that is god in his holy habitation it creates this image the hebrew words that are used it's god in his home god in his position god in his calling god fulfilling his purpose is these things god in his holy habitation is a father to those who need fathers god fulfilling his purpose god fulfilling what he is and is expressing his attributes he is a father to those who are orphaned he's a father to those who are abandoned he's the father to those who've been forsaken he is protector and provider and comforter to those who do not have a father the bible is explicitly stating that we can say a man has a need for a father he has a need for that kind of relationship in those who've been orphaned abandoned rejected estranged and are no longer protected and comforted and provided by that fatherly relationship he says i will be that to you i will do it god is a defender of those who have no husbands it doesn't mean a judge of the widows where he sits back like this is a beauty competition well i'll give her an 8 out of 10. that's not what judge of the widows means it means a protector a defender he is someone that's going to come to her aid into her defense god is a defender of those who have no husbands he's a protector he's a friend is even how some translations render it i found a couple uh translations called him the right ruler of the widow the right kind of rule the right ruler that she ought to have had the right ruler that the the kind of husband that she deserved the champion friend is the word that's used he's going to be a judge the champion friend one who will champion her cause look at her needs look at her weaknesses look what she's lacking and be there to meet those needs do we not see this type time and time again in the scripture and in the old testament that god is mindful of them than that god is it comes to their aid and comes to their defense god in his home in his position as a father of the orphan and the abandoned god is a defender and a protector the right ruler the champion friend of the widows those without husbands thus he makes a home he sets the solitary families he makes a home for the lonely those that are all by himself and makes them part of something he said at the solitary families he takes them and makes them part of a family and then the next verse is is directly tied to it he bringeth out those which are bound with chains he takes the bound and broken by the hand and leads them to a place of liberty and prosperity he loses them from their difficulty loses them from their downtroddenesses takes them out of the bondage that they're once in he says i'm going to take you by the hand and i'm going to set you in a family i'm going to give you the proper kind of relationships i'm going to improve your well-being he sees the broken and he sees the needy and as a man in his place and in his position he takes you by the hand and leads you out of that brokenness this is part of god this is part of god's character this could have been written of god in genesis 1 1. in the beginning was god who in his holy habitation had the characteristics and the attributes to be a father to those who had none to be a husband to those who had none to put people who had no family and placement families and to take those were broken and downtrodden rejected and wound and bruised and scattered to take them by the hand and lead them to liberty to break the bar the chains that bind them and set them in a place of prosperity it could have said that about god in genesis 1 1. and this is why god instinctively declared when he saw adam all by himself it's not good for a man to be just by himself god did not want adam to feel that way neither does god want you to feel alone neither does god want you to feel abandoned neither does god want you to feel rejection now i realize that any time you preach you know you want to preach you're going to preach for eight hours so you can always throw the qualifiers out there you know and kind of reign it in god uses our emotions to get our attention and we could suffer rejected because god wants us to feel that but not because he wants us to be rejected but because he's wanting us to come to something he's wanting to teach us something so he uses the rejection he uses the hurt feelings he uses our emotions it's the sorrow that's quicken inside of us that leads us to a place of repentance it's the it's the pain of guilt and conviction that causes us to say we're sorry to somebody else it's the feeling that you heard somebody that caused you to humble yourself so emotions and feelings are fine he said well god doesn't want you to be ejected it's the same sense that paul says you may be cast down but not forsaken you may feel the being cast down but god does not want your final state and your characterization and your general existence to be one of being dejected and alone and hurting and abused i mean you think about it to be alone and be i feel lonely is probably the most devastating of emotions especially the unrequited love when there's feelings there's something has been expressed you you share how you feel you put your you lay yourself down on the line you you're wanting to work on something you're wanting to promote something and and you put your heart into it and you're in love and you try to you try to see that this thing can be successful and then you're met with rejection that's the greatest hurt that a natural man can feel or a natural woman could feel and that's why the devil prays on those emotions that's why he kind of uses those insecurities and the fears of rejection to cause us to enter into the kind of relationships that aren't healthy and don't promote the best you the devil preys on those feelings i don't want to be abandoned i don't want to be rejected that sense of loneliness and the devil working on that leads us to the wrong things but god says i want to meet that i want to satisfy that myself and so we're moving moving moving along rather well today it's almost 11 30. let me just try to put this in some some terms that might just give us some conclusions to go forward a true family gives us a sense of identity and would give us a sense i'm proud to be identified with this family that there's there's the kind of harmony the togetherness and what we support and what we do and how we live our lives it gives a an individual a sense of belonging and identity family satisfies that shock part of that shock and that longing deep within mankind and man within the confines of that family and woman in the confines of that family a son and daughter grow and mature and they find their identity and their satisfaction and their joy and their belonging in that family but then they mature to a point to where now there's another need that needs to be fulfilled and that can't be fulfilled alone within that family so what does god do he makes another one so that shock is always met that shock deep within mankind is always met through these relationships and i want to say this that true a true church functions in a similar way it's a place where we should feel at home it's a place that we feel that we belong listen if you won't eat at a restaurant because you're uncomfortable and you're not certain how it's being prepared and you don't like the people that serve you and everyone's rude and they don't ever let you sit where you want and you just hey right if you're dissatisfied where you're going to lunch and you don't like the people then don't go to lunch there and if church is a place you're not comfortable don't keep forcing yourself to go to an uncomfortable church church shouldn't be that way right that's not what church is for is a place to always be uncomfortable now i know there's a lot of preachers that say that and one i can't remember who it was that said it we're going back hundreds of years now he says the goal of ministry is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comforted i don't know if i buy into that necessarily but i get the point but something about church should be a place where you feel safe enough to be corrected you feel safe enough to be afflicted like you can trust the person who's afflicting you okay i know you got a plan in this you know i know there's a purpose in this so afflict away and so church should have the same feelings where you have a sense of identity and belonging and you feel sheltered and the bible says this speaking to the believer in galatians chapter 6 verse 10 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household to faith so the first one is you have to do good unto all men that we are all as believers under a responsibility a christian is responsible for doing good unto all men we don't ask their political affiliation first to determine whether or not we should be good to them right you do good unto all men how you treat others is how you treat christ this is something that we're taught from the scripture it's something we ought to know from the beginning that there's no room for being bitter being vengeful being inspiteful being nasty to anyone do good unto all men but paul makes this distinction especially unto them who are of the household of faith in other words those that belong to the family of faith the household it means related by blood or of the same house so those who are in the faith relate to one another as family and are considered a family and therefore when we gather us into church we should promote the virtues of family you should have a sense that we are family not just a connection of individuals that are a group of individuals that are loosely connected to something like we think we all believe the same notice what he teaches timothy first timothy chapter 5 verses 1 and 2 rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father and the younger men is brethren the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity first timothy chapter 5 verses 1 and 2 again rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father so we could take time to say how there's a way that you should approach an elder but what is paul saying that elder is like a father to you and the younger men are like brothers to you treat the elder women as mothers treat the youngers as sisters with all purity it's it's paul actually saying those that you fellowship with those that are in this household of faith are to you the old elders are fathers to you treat them as such those that are younger they're brothers those that are aids the mothers the sisters and those we all look at one another as brother and sister and the true meaning of brother and sister children of god should not be lost in the repetition like the formality of because we so brother jeff or our brother randy we use these title brothers and people think well why do you and sometimes i think it sounds odd to people brother who or you say brother branham why do you call him brother brown so i'm just following the pattern of scripture where and they called him brother saul and they called one another in scripture they said brother they that was the way that they referred to one another and it ought not to be just a sign of respect in terms of saying mr mcgear or mr that or misses that but rather it should be a reminder to us that this is how i view you that in christ you are my brother in christ you are my sister and that in doing so it creates the feeling of family and promotes the virtues of family and creates obligations to one another as family through christ we can be the friends that stick closer than a brother through christ we can be those that stick closer than blood relation or relatives we can be the brother and the sister to one another that we need and maybe we don't have through the fl through the flesh now james chapter one verse 27 it says pure religion because if you if you think of it god has expressed what his nature is to be a father to the fatherless a judge of the widows he said at the solitarion families this is what god wants to do then we see that god has given us a church family so we can see how god uses these different things to meet these needs to satisfy these things and i'm having to go quickly and maybe not expanding on some of these as i would like to but now notice the duty that james imposes upon us as christians pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows and their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world this is not an either or you're not choosing your religion here pure religion undefiled before god and the father is to is the and to visit the fatherless and the widows and their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world many can do a good job of appearing to be unspotted from the world but fail on the first point pure undefiled religion means sincere genuine not hypocritical actually makes reference to a diamond being free from any flaw or water being pure from any impurities that's what pure religion undefiled before god something that is genuine and free of flaws is manifested in visiting the fatherless and the widows and their affliction and keeping yourself unspotted from the world and this is not just ceremony where we're going to have a food banker we're going to do this or we're going to do that but james imposes a divine duty and the fulfillment of the gospel on these very things that if your religion is going to be pure and undefiled before god if you're going to be in the service of the gospel if you're going to satisfy the requirements of the christian church then you must visit the fatherless and the widows and their affliction in other words our religion our belief our convictions is made known by our acts of holiness in the way that we dress the way that we live keeping unspotted from the world but also in our acts of mercy how we treat those who are in need to visit the fatherless to visit the widows says in their affliction is to look after them to help them to care for them as paul would say do good unto all men especially those of the household of faith then there's a divine duty task the the the church member the church itself the local body us as christians have a responsibility to express this nature of god to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction to minister to those who are deprived of one of the most basic necessities of man are humankind companionship friendship provide those look after those who need it most and where they need it most he's saying visit the needy visit the afflicted but he refers to the fatherless and the widows why this is the nature of god i'm a father to the fathers i'm a defender of the widow so he tells us to visit them in their affliction isaiah chapter 1 verse 17 learn to do well seek judgment we can like those first two right i want to learn and i want to i want to have a lot of opinions learn to do well seek righteousness relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless again that means defend them look after them plead for the widow to judge the fatherless is not to condemn them but actually to defend them to be the champion for them relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow this is a necessary admonishment why to resist the hurtful sinful tendencies we have from fallen flesh in the perfect family in the divine order in the beginning the masterpiece family these things would have been instinctive these things as adam even expressed and portrayed that this is something that he would have done instinctively but this is a necessary admonishment to resist these hurtful tendencies to judge to restrain to resist to not help because of the fall it's pride that enters in that causes these things it's insecurities it's bitterness there's histories there's all sorts of things that influence it but god is saying that we ought to relieve the oppressed judge the father's plead for the widows is is my emphasis on that is my instruction that we ought to do that this bible's plainly saying that we should but my point is to identify in scripture how that when god said it's not good for men to be alone these are all the reasons why god says these things that's why he says what he says in ecclesiastes that's why he says it in the book of proverbs in psalms in galatians and timothy in james and isaiah because it's not good for man to be alone god through these verses that we read in psalms and timothy and galatians and james isaiah he's taking great care to see that that vulnerability in mankind is not exploited it is not good for a man to be just by himself when god says that it's almost as if he exposes the most tender part of a man's heart a lot of things he could have said about man not being good about this or good about that but he says it's not good for man to be alone he identifies a vulnerability in a weakness that sometimes we're not willing to admit that's why loneliness hurts as much as it does that's why abandonment and rejection hurt as much as it does and let me say this that's why toxic relationships are even worse than having none because it it exploits that weakness and that vulnerability it takes advantage of that need the wounds of the abuse and alienation from family and the hurts that we experience from friendships can lead the deepest scars and i would say this that as christians as a church we must take great care that we not repeat the failures of some families brother brown says you know we need one another right now more than we ever did in all the history of the world is right now real royal believers we need each other this is another place where we're truly in the battle and we need each other more than we ever did in all times he says we need christians we need each other now more than ever that's what we need this is this is a need within us we have not matured to the state of independency from one another because what is our maturity marked by scripturally a greater dependence upon god i'm depending on him to fulfill his word from start to finish this must be an increasing characteristic inside of where i am dependent i'm not becoming more independent by virtue of my my revelation i'm not becoming more independent by virtue of my age and my experience but i realize the longer i live the more i need you the more we need each other the more mutually dependent we become on each other he said right now that's what we need we need christians we need real royal believers we need people who are not selfish we need people who are sacrificing we need people who are willing to love and willing to to lay aside differences and willing to embrace one another to see that things things can be done and accomplish where people need it i want to read the scripture again in closing it is not good genesis 2 18 it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him a help meet one that complemented him one he identified with complimented him sure adam you look good today right but just one that was was aided him was fit for his purpose and his use and the job that he had someone he identified with bone of my bone flesh of my flesh someone he was connected to someone that understood him and this need still res exists within us and it's a need that cannot be satisfied by mere company with people it's a need for something genuine that's why god said i'm going to give you a help meet and if i could say it in this way and try to find a find just the right way to say it god designed that need when he looked at man and said it's not good for man to be alone god made him that way god made adam with this longing to be loved god made man with this longing for companionship this longing to be understood god made that desire inside of you to belong the need to feel loved you're craving for acceptance god made that desire can we acknowledge that we have it to some varying degree some may be more than others but could we all admit that deep down inside of us that if i'm using the wrong language to describe it is there something that you as an intelligent person can say he may not be saying exactly the way that i would say but yes something's being identified deep inside my person some shock that still resides within me as a man or a woman a boy or a girl i have that need god made that need and having created that need in mankind he's the one that knows how to meet it and he's mindful of that need and i would want that to be the take home through all these scriptures i've read is god has allowed the bible to be written in such a way by the inspiration of god that we can kind of take it in this context we place it in today say look god knows my human condition god knows what i'm going through god knows how i feel god knows how i'm i when i what i'm thinking what i'm acting god knows what these things feel like and he's mindful of these things this very need life has a way of perverting that life has a way of creating complexes and certain things happen to cause us to hold back from making true relationships and we're reluctant to form new bonds we're reluctant to trust again we're reluctant to test to take a step forward and be a part of something because of things that have happened before and that's something that god's going to have to resolve in your heart because he wants you to fit in he wants you to belong he wants you to have true proper healthy relationships because god looks at you and i can say this in john chapter 14 verse 18 he can look at you no matter where you are right now he says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you comfortless is the word that means bereft of parents bereft of a father fatherless i will not leave you without this kind of relationship i will come to you i will come to you if you could just bow your heads for a moment all right let's just stand to our feet it is not good that the man should be alone so i'll give him somebody for him and then god repeats it to jacob abraham and constantly throughout scripture i won't leave you until i've accomplished what i've said it's said in the old testament it said in the new testament i'll never leave you nor forsake you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you there's a part of us that may even feel as if there's none that can relate as a young man i remember before i served the lord my emotional struggles and the things i felt the things i experienced that when i began to serve god there was a scripture that god made alive to me by revelation that gave me great comfort so when jesus was hanging on the cross there's the man alone again [Music] adam in the beginning was a man who dwelt alone now christ misunderstood crucified not even fully understood by his disciples even as he sat there on the cross die and he's saying behold thy mother behold thy son and joining families together and causing those to be united being rejected by one on his uh uh to his left and just the persecution and the suffering rejected by those that he came to and as if the hurt wasn't bad enough then darkness was felt over the face of the earth from noon to three o'clock it says there was darkness upon all the land and we know by what jesus cried and expressed that this was symbolic of god turning his back on his son and could you imagine jesus even at 12 years old say i must be about my father's business and that communion he had with the father well i only do i only do what the father tells me to do i only say what the father tells me to say in some 33 years of life he always had this consciousness of the father the father the father in obedience to the father's will he takes this cross and carries it to golgotha and he's there hammered to a cross and bleeding out and dying still crying out to the father but then darkness covers the earth and god whose characteristic is light god forsakes them god turns his back on him and he cries my god my god why hast thou forsaken me we're not guessing just at the darkness what it meant we know by the fact that jesus christ cries it out deep within himself i have been forsaken by god god my father why why have you turned your back on me you think my what an instance what a moment and the picture we see is once again the man the second adam is all alone and why why would god do such a thing why would god bear this why would god do this he did it so that you and i in the atonement would have something that meets our rejection something that would meet our loneliness something that would atone for our hurts and our pains at the hands of others and he say i can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities i have felt forsaken i have felt the love of the father turned away from me and i bored that for you on the cross that you could look to me and you could come to me and i'll do the rest [Music] it's so deep within god's nature for you to feel this that through his son he atoned for rejection where's my atonement where's my relief where's my redemption there on the cross that day he paid the price for it so that you wouldn't have to live with it forever [Music] the bible matthew chapter 18 he's talking about little ones he says if a man had a hundred sheep and one of them went astray does the shepherd not leave the ninety and nine and go into the mountains and seek the one that went astray why does he do that he's not hung up on hundreds right it's not the number of a hundred why did he do it because the number one it was enough that it was just one the thought of one being alone in the mountains the one thought of one being vulnerable the thought of one not being a part of the fold was enough to cause the shepherd to go after him and he said if it be so that he find it verily i send you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the 99 which went astr not astray there's an old hymn that's written are the 99 not enough why is it you would have to go and chase after the one because god says it's not good for that one to be alone it's not enough that i have 99 and know that there's one who's all alone [Music] that's the nature of god that's the instinct of god i want to make the invitation to you today to come to him and in in your in your weakness and your vulnerability even in your hurts of rejections past and ask god to begin to heal and to satisfy that you might find your contentment within him so that you can fully enjoy the relationships he's given you to satisfy that need deep inside of you some of us have been unable to be satisfied in the very relationships he's given us because we still hold on to the pain of rejection deep within our past and we still build walls even with spouses even with people that love us even with people that are reaching out their hands to help us we still look back to things that have happened in our past and we're unwilling to take a step forward so i'm not the one holding my hand i'll say hey trust me trust me as your friend trust me as a minister trust me as a man of god i'm saying come to him let him do the rest just come to him and let him look out after you let him care for you let him work on your needs let him reveal himself to you as a father let him reveal himself to you as a husband let him reveal himself to you as a friend as the comforter and then by trusting him and seeing he'll fulfill his promises [Music] they can make you to be that sister and that brother that others need we were having dinner here recently and with some some friends and it was the course of the conversation i don't exactly remember but i can still just remember the moment and it was sister nicole that said it and she was speaking i believe just about the the of of a believer and a christian and she said it's like the it's like that statue of liberty that's the the same that's inscribed on the statue of liberty it's called the a poem was written sonnet was written the new colossus was the name of it and this lady liberty was called the mother of exiles the scattered the rejected those who no longer felt at home in what was called their home country who went seeking for a better place and the inscription closes with this keep ancient land your storied pomp christ she with silent lips give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the homeless temptest lost tossed to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door i say that's what i want to do today is to lift this up christ stands come unto me all you are burdened and heavy laden and i'll give you rest i will not leave you comfortless and i desire that as god has raised up a new church may we not be a new colossus but may we become a sister of exiles may we be those who can point to liberty in christ jesus and say you can keep your story pumped but give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore sinned the homeless and the tempest tossed we'll take them we'll take them if you have a caste system we'll take the lowest cast if you have those that are no longer desirable we'll welcome them why we believe in a god who can we believe in a word that is powerful we believe in a healer we believe in a deliverer we believe a god that is greater than any spirit any change that bind i'm not afraid of a circumstance i may not have the wisdom for it i may not have the understanding i may not be able to answer all of your questions my goodness the things that we're facing today are so complex that they're the complexities of them the complications of them we don't have all the answers but i thank god we have one who is the answer who could make so much sense of life to where the question's irrelevant give us so much purpose and belonging that the very thing we crave for the very thing we long for the very thing that we thought mattered the most in life through him it now finally has perspective and relevance and we just relax we say lord i love you this is great and so i i share these things so that you understand there's an almighty god it says the lord god said your jehovah elohim said i know it's not good that you're alone so i know you've had your heads bowed would there be a hand that would want to raise and say lord i'm coming home to where i belong i'm just coming to you today lord our gracious heavenly father lord it's it's not an emotional trick of a public speaker to take something that is common to everyone who stands here today and begin to speak on it in such a way to conjure up emotions and feelings and sentiments to only capitalize on them in the end but lord it was you it was you today that cut away layers and scars and complexes and got right down way deep in our hearts and said the reason you feel the way you do is because i made you with a need and that need has been misused and manipulated and abused and deep inside you i made you that way and the misuse of it has caused these things but i stand as one today he expresses this god expressed this you expressed this lord it is not good that man should be alone i will make for him [Music] a help meet for him today lord we come to you with our scars and our wounds our complexes and our fears [Music] our misunderstandings of yesterday and our questions of tomorrow we stand before you we say lord i accept you as the comforter as the father as the right ruler and champion friend i'll find my friendship this longing lord i will find that it begins to be satisfied in this step of coming to you [Music] and saying lord this is a need that transcends my natural abilities this is a need that transcends my nature as being a mcgeary lord this is a need that you placed in me as a human being and i said god you alone know how to fulfill it you alone know how to heal it and i surrender myself to you today and lord his hands are raised if we can't even understand what it means we don't even know what it represents and and just exactly what i'm doing but lord i feel i'm taking a step to you today as someone real someone mindful may that be the step that's taken lord i could just take this one step and may you lord as being expressed as that father the prodigal may you come running lord to the hurting to the lost to the huddled masses lord may you come running [Music] and meet these needs that we have lord may we take this understanding to better relate to those who are amongst us the hurts that people feel the way that people sometimes develop a an exterior lord and an uprightness and shoulders back and a real sternness because they've had to learn to fend for themselves they've had to learn to speak up for themselves they had to learn to stand on their own two feet lord i pray that you give us a grace to get beneath those who don't even know they need help so that we can help them may we be this light by the golden door welcoming your children home i commit us as a church to you these people to you with hands raised and hearts open in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
