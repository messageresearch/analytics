[0:01] let's turn in our bibles to hebrews
[0:03] chapter 12
[0:06] verses 1 to 3. might have lost a little
[0:09] bit of my time today but
[0:11] um we know that we'll have
[0:15] opportunity to gather again and uh and
[0:18] pick up on these things if necessary if
[0:19] we need to cut it short
[0:22] hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3
[0:25] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[0:27] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[0:30] let us lay aside every weight and the
[0:33] sin
[0:33] which doth so easily beset us and let us
[0:36] run with patience the race that is set
[0:38] before us
[0:40] looking unto jesus the author
[0:43] and finisher of our faith and that faith
[0:47] we know here
[0:48] is even a divine faith that we that we
[0:50] can possess and participate in
[0:52] not necessarily our own intellectual
[0:54] faith author and finisher of our faith
[0:56] who for the joy that was set before
[0:58] him this is the phrase we're very drawn
[1:00] to who for the joy that was set before
[1:02] him
[1:02] endured the cross despise in the shame
[1:05] and is
[1:05] set down at the right hand of the throne
[1:07] of god so he
[1:09] for the joy which was set before him
[1:10] despised the shame disregarded it
[1:13] brushed it off set it down and it sat
[1:15] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:16] god for consider him
[1:17] that endured such contradiction of
[1:20] sinners against himself
[1:21] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[1:23] minds
[1:24] amen god bless you you could be seated
[1:27] this morning
[1:28] my title today and continue on the
[1:30] subject of pure joy is victory ahead is
[1:32] victory now
[1:34] and i originally god had dealt with my
[1:36] heart in
[1:37] just really in a very enthusiastic and
[1:39] excited about the prospect of victory
[1:42] and that where there's challenges and
[1:44] we're going through something and we're
[1:45] facing difficulty we ought to look at it
[1:47] as an opportunity
[1:48] to experience a deliverance to
[1:49] experience a victory and to see god come
[1:52] on the scene and do something tremendous
[1:54] so a challenge is an opportunity to
[1:56] experience victory a challenge is an
[1:57] opportunity
[1:58] to rejoice in overcoming and
[2:02] on the subject of pure joy this the pure
[2:05] joy is the joy of the lord that that's
[2:07] what it is when
[2:08] i talk about pure joy i'm not talking
[2:09] about a human emotion or an excitement
[2:11] as a human but i'm talking about the joy
[2:12] of the lord so it's not something that's
[2:13] solely characterized
[2:15] by human emotion or our human
[2:17] experiences but it's something divine
[2:18] that comes from god
[2:20] and pure joy is not the absence of
[2:22] uncomfortable emotions or the absence of
[2:24] negative emotions
[2:26] uh pure joy is not the immunity from
[2:27] sadness or not being able to feel pain
[2:30] but pure joy is the product of purpose
[2:32] that where there's a purpose
[2:34] you derive fulfillment you derive
[2:36] satisfaction from fulfilling the purpose
[2:38] and that gives us joy so our the joy of
[2:40] the lord is going to be found
[2:42] in submitting to surrendering to
[2:44] recognizing and accepting
[2:46] his purpose and the and the will the
[2:48] desire that he has
[2:49] for you and for your for your life and
[2:52] so
[2:52] as we can say it this way that if we're
[2:55] going to experience
[2:56] joy we don't want to pursue happiness or
[2:59] pursue things that make us happy or
[3:01] pursue things for
[3:02] the the sole purpose of being excited
[3:04] but we want to
[3:05] we want to pursue purpose and in
[3:07] pursuing god's purpose the product or
[3:09] the outcome of that is going to be
[3:10] his joy and if we're pursuing purpose
[3:13] that means we're not going to run away
[3:14] from pain
[3:15] and sometimes to fulfill purpose you got
[3:17] to experience things that are
[3:18] uncomfortable to pursue
[3:20] purpose and to fulfill the will of god
[3:21] in your life you have to face things
[3:22] that are difficult and and be challenged
[3:24] and suffer
[3:25] so as we're running towards our destiny
[3:27] that we're willing to face the pain
[3:28] we're willing to endure difficulty
[3:30] because we know it's worth it
[3:32] now the last two services we spoke on
[3:34] the subject of num
[3:35] and in looking at the subject of num it
[3:37] was meant to provoke
[3:39] uh the appropriate level of feeling for
[3:41] those who are losing it
[3:42] and and there's been many that have
[3:44] provided some feedback and expressed
[3:46] just how direct it was
[3:47] and i believe that was god dealing with
[3:49] you in a very special way
[3:50] that it's very easy for us for
[3:52] particular individuals through their
[3:54] life experiences church experiences
[3:56] relationships and
[3:57] business experiences a lot of different
[3:59] things that we can go through to where
[4:01] we experience emotional numbness we
[4:03] become numb to things
[4:05] and then there's a way that it turns
[4:07] into spiritual numbness because we
[4:08] become so unaffected by things because
[4:10] we're trying to protect our emotions and
[4:12] our hearts
[4:13] that god who wants to deal with us in
[4:14] our emotions and wants to give us the
[4:16] fruits of the spirit
[4:17] and wants us to enjoy certain things
[4:19] we're unable to enjoy the fullness of
[4:21] the christian life
[4:22] because of that numbness and and so i
[4:24] was dressing something very very
[4:26] specific
[4:27] but i want to read in second corinthians
[4:29] chapter 5 verse 7
[4:31] the bible says for we walk by faith not
[4:33] by sight
[4:34] and it's a parenthetical phrase that
[4:36] paul inserts into the larger
[4:38] point that he's making but it's inserted
[4:40] by the translators in such a way
[4:42] that this statement could be taken
[4:44] outside of the context and it remains
[4:46] the same
[4:47] and so it adds some clarity to where it
[4:49] is in the chapter but we look at this it
[4:52] says for we walk by faith
[4:53] not by sight let's take sight to
[4:55] encompass all our emotions
[4:58] that we do not walk by physical emotion
[5:00] or physical sense we walk by faith
[5:03] brother brahma says we don't go by
[5:04] feelings we go by god's word
[5:07] and so though we were addressing
[5:09] emotional numbness
[5:10] and and how we can become very
[5:11] emotionally numb or even spiritual numb
[5:14] uh i want to say this faith is not being
[5:17] emotionally numb
[5:19] that we can become so emotionally i'm
[5:20] unaffected all this is real faith no
[5:22] you've just become numb
[5:23] so faith is not becoming numb or void of
[5:26] feeling or void of emotion
[5:28] faith has some sense to it faith has a
[5:30] sense faith
[5:32] with faith you experience joy you
[5:34] experience happiness you experience a
[5:35] life
[5:36] full of the fruits of the spirit and so
[5:38] we need to be balanced
[5:40] that in dealing with being numb the
[5:42] object wasn't to
[5:43] uh take us from being emotionless to
[5:45] just a bunch of wild fiery no
[5:47] and and become emotional creatures which
[5:50] is brother here and i'm just crying all
[5:51] the time or
[5:52] i'm just laughing all the time and just
[5:53] become i may be emotionally ecstatic so
[5:56] we're not pushing you to be emotional
[5:59] but we are dealing with a hardness of
[6:00] heart and a and a callousness
[6:02] and a disconnectedness or even an
[6:05] indifference that we can begin to
[6:06] experience
[6:07] through the things that we go through
[6:08] and provoke the appropriate level of
[6:10] feeling
[6:11] but let us be certain that what we do as
[6:13] christians is we walk by faith not by
[6:15] our emotions
[6:16] and be and and be conscious that god
[6:18] uses emotions and will deal with
[6:20] us in the realm of emotion so we need to
[6:22] be sensitive
[6:23] sensitive enough so that god is dealing
[6:24] with us properly and sensitive enough so
[6:27] that we can enjoy being christians
[6:30] there's not a better life to live than
[6:31] living the christian life
[6:33] now in hebrews chapter 12 we'll look at
[6:35] verse 2
[6:36] it says looking unto jesus and now we're
[6:40] now we're taking a step further in this
[6:41] looking unto jesus the author and
[6:43] finisher of our faith so there's a
[6:45] process he's the beginner
[6:47] and he's the perfecter so it starts it
[6:49] goes through the process and it's
[6:50] perfected
[6:51] who now this is the one that we're
[6:53] looking unto who for the joy that was
[6:55] set before him this must have something
[6:57] to do with the perfecting of our faith
[6:59] who for the joy that was set before him
[7:01] endured the cross despising the shame
[7:04] and is set down at the right hand of the
[7:06] throne of god
[7:07] so jesus christ endured death and
[7:10] despised shame
[7:12] because of the joy that was set before
[7:14] him
[7:15] so it says look unto jesus now there's
[7:17] something about christ and his example
[7:19] that he wants us to ponder and to
[7:20] consider
[7:21] he was able to endure death and despise
[7:23] shame because of a joy
[7:25] set before him so think of it this way
[7:28] and these phrases
[7:29] i think will help us as we carry forward
[7:31] in this his present circumstances
[7:33] versus his future circumstance so in his
[7:36] present circumstances
[7:38] you can say that he was suffering as the
[7:40] next verse says
[7:41] such contradiction of sinners that's
[7:43] bitter hostility
[7:44] so he was experiencing bitter hostility
[7:46] he was experiencing
[7:48] shame and he experienced death so that
[7:50] was a that was a circumstance that he
[7:51] was enduring he was
[7:52] enduring the cross despising the shame
[7:55] suffering
[7:56] this bitter hostility that was what he
[7:58] was presently going through
[7:59] but his future circumstance the bible
[8:02] says is he's now set down at the right
[8:04] hand of the throne of god
[8:05] so the verse affords us the ability to
[8:08] look at a circumstance that jesus was in
[8:10] and while in that circumstance he was
[8:13] forward looking to a joy that was set
[8:14] before him
[8:15] and then it tells us that he's now
[8:17] sitting at the right hand of the throne
[8:18] of god
[8:19] so pondered that how that this is his
[8:22] future circumstance versus his
[8:24] present circumstances he could endure
[8:27] the bitter hostility
[8:28] he could endure the death he could
[8:30] disregard the shame
[8:31] and the humility of the manner of that
[8:34] shame the manner of the death the manner
[8:36] and the humility of dying that dying on
[8:38] the cross was the most horrible
[8:40] death that you could have it wasn't that
[8:42] he died in an accident it wasn't that he
[8:43] died of old age
[8:45] it wasn't even that he was murdered in
[8:46] his sleep but to be hung on a cross
[8:48] was a despicable shaming event that was
[8:51] meant to humiliate
[8:52] and jesus was able to endure such
[8:54] contradiction of sinners endured the
[8:56] death and even disregard the shame
[8:58] and the humiliation of the manner of the
[9:01] dead
[9:03] now he did not consider those things in
[9:05] themselves
[9:06] as a joy but he can look over those
[9:10] things to the joy beyond it
[9:12] so it wasn't this this attitude this you
[9:14] know sadist added to oh
[9:16] i just love being you know inflicted
[9:17] with pain isn't this awesome
[9:19] you know isn't this misery a wonderful
[9:21] it wasn't that he
[9:23] saw the cross as a joy it wasn't that he
[9:24] saw the humiliation as a joy
[9:26] it wasn't that he saw the suffering as a
[9:28] joy when the cataline tells was being
[9:30] whipped into his back and his flesh is
[9:32] being torn from his body
[9:33] it wasn't that jesus enjoyed that
[9:37] i don't think that any of you ever
[9:38] thought that he did but
[9:40] ponder this when we talk about being
[9:42] joyful
[9:44] it doesn't mean that you have to derive
[9:46] some pleasure from the pain
[9:47] or derive some pleasure from the fact
[9:50] that you reject
[9:51] oh i love it when people hate me oh i
[9:53] love it that when people beat me up and
[9:55] they inflict pain and
[9:56] i hope i go home today and they've
[9:58] stolen my laptop wouldn't that be
[9:59] awesome
[10:01] that's not the kind of attitude that we
[10:02] have we think well that person's got a
[10:04] mental disorder
[10:06] and so it wasn't that jesus enjoyed
[10:08] those things or regarded those things
[10:10] themselves as a joy
[10:11] but he looked over those things to a joy
[10:14] beyond it
[10:15] so now there's there's a there's
[10:17] something that happens when he does that
[10:18] so he's going through pain and suffering
[10:21] there's shame there's humiliation
[10:22] there's bitter contradiction
[10:24] this is really a death but as he looks
[10:26] beyond it to the joy that is set before
[10:29] him
[10:30] it it flips back reverts back
[10:34] to to this present situation and the
[10:36] future
[10:37] joy that he knows is going to be there
[10:39] takes away the power
[10:41] of the present pain
[10:44] the future joys he's looking forward to
[10:46] the joy and he knows there's a joy
[10:48] coming
[10:48] it has it has this ability for christ
[10:51] now to almost
[10:52] re radiate back to him and take the
[10:55] sting out of what he's going through
[10:58] it took the power away from the
[11:00] rejection it took a power away from the
[11:02] suffering
[11:03] so christ was upheld
[11:07] despite the terrible emotional and
[11:09] physical suffering that he was going
[11:11] through
[11:12] he was upheld despite everything that he
[11:14] was enduring
[11:17] because he held something in view during
[11:19] his torment
[11:21] so he was being tormented he was
[11:23] suffering he he can be touched by the
[11:24] feeling of our infirmity so it wasn't
[11:26] that when jesus if we held
[11:28] a lighter to jesus's hand and begin to
[11:30] burn him he's like yeah that feels good
[11:32] i don't know what you're talking about i
[11:33] know what pain is
[11:34] he knew what pain was but in his torment
[11:37] he held something in view
[11:38] and with that in view he could rejoice
[11:40] presently
[11:42] in the purpose of his suffering he knew
[11:44] that what he was going through wasn't
[11:46] without purpose
[11:47] he knew that and this is where i i just
[11:50] feel
[11:50] i need to allude to this i wasn't
[11:52] planning on maybe breaking this part of
[11:53] the scripture down
[11:54] but jesus as he's suffering he knew that
[11:57] through his sacrifice
[11:58] it was going to bring many sons into
[12:00] glory so he could say it's all worth it
[12:02] every pain
[12:03] every agony even the rejection of his
[12:05] father he knew was going to bring many
[12:07] sons into glory
[12:08] paid the sacrifice for for mankind sin
[12:12] and actually avenge god's anger upon
[12:15] the elect that it would all be satisfied
[12:17] it would all be
[12:18] it would be justice and it would be play
[12:20] god's wrath towards us would be
[12:22] placated in himself so he knew it was
[12:24] going to accomplish something great
[12:26] and knowing that it provided him a
[12:28] solace it provided him a comfort
[12:30] it even provided him a joy in what he
[12:33] was suffering
[12:35] so the purpose of the suffering he knew
[12:36] look i'm not just being crucified
[12:38] and being made a political figure i
[12:41] heard a song one time
[12:42] it was written many years ago how that
[12:44] the crucifixion and i think maybe the
[12:46] language might be a little off-putting
[12:47] but the idea was that not not swear
[12:50] words or anything
[12:51] it's an incredible rap song no it was it
[12:54] was just a christian song that was
[12:56] written that
[12:57] the way in crucifying christ they didn't
[12:59] mean to but they made him a celebrity
[13:02] we may not use the celebrity but in
[13:04] crucify him they proved he was the
[13:05] messiah
[13:07] and so it was their their what they were
[13:10] doing he knew there was a purpose
[13:11] he wasn't just a puppet he just wasn't
[13:13] the fall guy he wasn't the scapegoat
[13:15] in that ah these things are just wait we
[13:17] found a guy to quell a rebellion and
[13:19] now everyone was respect us no they were
[13:22] accomplishing something very very great
[13:23] he knew his death was for a purpose
[13:25] and it helped him so as we're looking to
[13:28] jesus
[13:29] something about his future this is the
[13:31] part i just want you to catch because
[13:32] this is really my
[13:33] whole thought i'm just going to keep
[13:34] repeating myself for the remainder of
[13:36] the service there's something about his
[13:37] future
[13:38] change something about his present
[13:41] something about his future was enough to
[13:43] change what was happening presently
[13:46] so my my title is victory ahead
[13:49] is victory now if you believe
[13:53] if you believe that ultimately we're
[13:55] going to win let me ask
[13:57] show hands if you believe you're going
[13:58] to ultimately win then if you know for
[14:01] sure you're going to win then you are
[14:03] winning
[14:07] because you're you're not going to lose
[14:10] so
[14:10] even in sports if we knew the end and we
[14:12] knew the outcome and you know that in
[14:14] the end this team wins
[14:16] and you find out that at the beginning
[14:17] of the game they were down by so many
[14:19] runs or they
[14:19] had gotten behind by this this many
[14:21] points you could say well they're losing
[14:23] no they're not
[14:24] they're on their way to winning
[14:27] the score may be upside right upside
[14:29] down right now it may not look like
[14:30] they're winning but
[14:31] we know they are going to win so this is
[14:34] just a process
[14:35] in the result of winning come on sports
[14:39] fans or somebody
[14:41] if you know as the bride of jesus christ
[14:44] if you
[14:44] know that there's victory ahead and we
[14:46] just believe one day there's going to be
[14:48] victory one day there's going to be
[14:49] victory
[14:49] then it's victory now then no matter how
[14:52] bad it looks no matter how hard it is no
[14:54] matter how
[14:55] difficult things are then i believe we
[14:58] are winning
[15:03] why because we believe that we walk by
[15:05] faith not by sight
[15:07] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 for
[15:09] we walk by faith
[15:10] not by sight well let's just acknowledge
[15:13] this is not humanly rational
[15:16] if we went outside right now if we went
[15:17] to the park and we just started talking
[15:19] to people
[15:20] and we said oh well i just go by faith
[15:22] they'd be like
[15:24] you know they wouldn't really believe
[15:26] there's much value or merit in faith
[15:30] and so i understand that this statement
[15:32] really is the opposite of human instinct
[15:36] yeah put a blindfold on and try to get
[15:38] out of this room
[15:40] right and you realize that in this in
[15:43] the in a way that we rely so much on our
[15:45] senses for this scripture to say that we
[15:47] walk by faith not by sight
[15:49] we need to even stop being carnal even
[15:51] about the verse it's trying to tap us
[15:53] into something
[15:54] greater than physical sight
[15:57] now there's a statement and and i think
[15:59] it's something that is very very large
[16:02] a lot of different ways to approach it
[16:05] i'm sure you've heard the statement
[16:06] before
[16:07] perception is reality
[16:10] now i want us to ponder whether or not
[16:12] this is true
[16:14] and then if we if we feel that there is
[16:16] a truth to it we need to consider the
[16:17] true application or meaning of this
[16:19] phrase
[16:20] because to say that perception is
[16:22] reality perception
[16:24] is we we perceive by the input of our
[16:27] senses
[16:29] so if i closed my eyes then i could
[16:32] perceive that someone is singing or i
[16:34] if i if i if i use certain senses
[16:37] there's a perception that takes place so
[16:38] our senses
[16:39] send data to our brains and then our
[16:41] brains actually
[16:42] interpret the data and process it and
[16:45] you spit out an income
[16:47] an outcome they say well this is what it
[16:49] is data in and your brain says oh this
[16:52] looks like this this smells like that
[16:53] this is what it is
[16:54] and then we come to that conclusion so
[16:56] perception is the process
[16:58] of judging our senses our senses give us
[17:01] information our brain judges it
[17:03] and then we comprehend certain things to
[17:06] be
[17:06] so perception isn't necessarily an
[17:08] imagination but it's
[17:10] input and the brain judges the input and
[17:13] comes to a conclusion
[17:16] and in doing so there has to be a
[17:19] there has to be a contact that's made
[17:21] our senses have to be making contact
[17:23] with something
[17:24] and then our minds give it meaning does
[17:27] that
[17:27] does that make sense that there there's
[17:29] something have we
[17:31] have you perceived what i'm saying you
[17:33] know
[17:34] properly you hear something oh what did
[17:36] they say and it's
[17:37] it's i i guess there's a lot of things
[17:39] out there today it's amazing how the
[17:40] internet is made available to us a lot
[17:42] of
[17:42] uh a different phenomena to where you
[17:44] can hear a phrase and one person hears
[17:46] one thing another person hears another
[17:48] and then when they tell you what they
[17:49] heard you start hearing what they heard
[17:51] and they start hearing what you heard
[17:52] and then you can hear all there's
[17:53] certain phrases you can hear 10
[17:55] different things
[17:57] is the dress blue or is it gold is it
[17:59] this or is it there's different ways
[18:01] and you want to what is it really just
[18:03] tell me what it really is
[18:04] but what is it that's perception and
[18:07] there's certain ways that our minds can
[18:08] be tricked into perceiving certain
[18:09] things
[18:10] and so it's our senses are going out and
[18:11] perceiving it so in perception it does
[18:14] not necessarily imply actual knowledge
[18:17] for there to be perception there isn't
[18:19] necessarily a realization of what it
[18:21] really is well what is really being said
[18:23] because it can be said in such a way to
[18:24] make you think it's something else
[18:26] and and maybe i'll still use the slide
[18:29] so if anybody comes back and when i use
[18:31] this slide you all know what it
[18:32] what it what's coming so you could just
[18:34] sit back and watch everyone else fall
[18:36] for it
[18:36] but there's a way that you can put a
[18:38] phrase up on the board cover half of it
[18:40] and ask everybody what does it say
[18:42] and everyone will say ice cream is good
[18:46] because that's exactly what you're
[18:47] thinking it says remove the cover from
[18:49] it it's just random letters
[18:51] but the mind actually fills in the
[18:53] bottom part of the letters based upon
[18:55] the top part that it sees
[18:57] and our mind is really really good at
[18:58] doing that
[19:00] filling in the blank spots and your
[19:01] periphery that's just how the mind works
[19:03] and so there's a way that we perceive
[19:05] things
[19:05] but it doesn't necessarily mean it's
[19:07] real
[19:08] so perception is based upon senses an
[19:10] odor or a flash of light a noise a bump
[19:13] you know something that's tactile or
[19:14] taste these are ways that we perceive
[19:16] things
[19:17] but this is what the phrase perception
[19:21] is reality is saying
[19:22] what we perceive to us is fact
[19:26] what we perceive to us is truth
[19:30] if you if you say something and i
[19:32] perceive you to say
[19:33] to to say it what i perceive you to say
[19:36] is to me what you said they say that's
[19:39] funny you just said you like spaghetti i
[19:41] didn't say i like spaghetti you know i
[19:42] don't like spaghetti no i heard you say
[19:44] it
[19:45] right and it's all based upon perception
[19:48] i don't well
[19:49] and so what you perceive to you as fact
[19:51] truth or israel
[19:53] and when somebody thinks something to
[19:54] perceive something it can become so
[19:56] stubborn that really there's no amount
[19:58] of evidence that can
[20:00] sway them from the contrary the one
[20:03] example i really love of this is there
[20:04] was
[20:05] two conspiracy theorists they were with
[20:07] and they were really deep into the
[20:08] conspiracy theory
[20:10] of who who killed john f kennedy and
[20:13] just so happens they both died at the
[20:14] same time and they went to heaven
[20:16] you realize i'm telling a joke now right
[20:19] and they went to heaven and
[20:20] this they lived their whole lives just
[20:21] enamored with the jfk conspiracy and
[20:23] they believed it you know they just knew
[20:25] as a conspiracy it was probably the cia
[20:26] joined with the mob
[20:28] and it was cuba and it was russia and
[20:30] they all you know it was
[20:31] something really really nefarious the
[20:33] secret service was in on it the cia was
[20:35] in on it
[20:36] the you know everyone there's a big huge
[20:38] conspiracy
[20:39] and so they they get to heaven and peter
[20:41] says you know what
[20:42] we always let one person always let
[20:44] people ask one question
[20:46] before they enter in that they've always
[20:47] wanted to answer it and they both looked
[20:48] at each and said wow awesome this is
[20:50] that this is their chance
[20:51] so we want to know who killed john f
[20:53] kennedy both of us that's the one
[20:54] question we want to know
[20:56] and so they won't peter goes away he's
[20:58] going to go ask god and they were just
[20:59] so excited about what was going to
[21:00] happen they just knew this was going to
[21:02] be their chance to
[21:03] to find out the truth and peter comes
[21:05] back and says i've asked god who it was
[21:07] and god said that it was one shooter it
[21:10] was oswald he did it and he acted alone
[21:13] and the conspiracy theorist went
[21:18] this is way bigger than we thought
[21:24] did you get it there's not god's in on
[21:27] the conspiracy
[21:29] because what they perceived became so
[21:31] stubborn in their head
[21:32] it was their reality they weren't
[21:35] willing to consider any other reality
[21:37] and that's how perception becomes
[21:38] reality but it's misleading
[21:42] because perception only defines your
[21:43] reality not how things really are in
[21:45] fact
[21:49] perception does not change reality but
[21:51] this is where it's important to
[21:53] understand remember my
[21:54] my subject is victory head is victory
[21:56] now so we're dealing with our perception
[21:59] perception does not change reality but
[22:01] it influences our thinking and behavior
[22:03] within it
[22:05] so if if you if it really in this room
[22:08] right now you perceived it to be very
[22:10] hot
[22:10] then you might start fanning yourself
[22:12] and and trying to cool off a little bit
[22:14] because that's how you perceive it
[22:15] but if in reality it was frigid your
[22:18] your perception doesn't change
[22:20] the fact that maybe it's 67 degrees and
[22:22] you might think that is hot i don't know
[22:24] uh i i sometimes what the other day i
[22:27] guess
[22:28] jack woke up and said he thought it was
[22:29] christmas that's how cold it was
[22:32] i woke up and thought it was christmas
[22:36] but perception then though it does not
[22:39] change reality
[22:40] it can influence your behavior
[22:43] within the reality and that way many
[22:46] times sometimes people's behavior does
[22:48] not conform
[22:49] with what your perception of reality is
[22:52] why is everybody running away
[22:54] or why is it you remain calm why
[22:56] everyone else around you is losing their
[22:57] heads
[22:59] it has to do with perception therefore
[23:01] our perception
[23:03] of our circumstances dictates our
[23:06] condition
[23:07] within them
[23:10] so what we perceive about what we
[23:12] perceive about reality is going to
[23:13] determine whether or not we panic or
[23:14] determine whether or not
[23:15] we do this or whether or not we do that
[23:17] so it's our perception we can't say
[23:18] that perception is meaningless that well
[23:20] perception is reality that's not true
[23:22] reality's reality and what reality is
[23:24] that's what matters yes but
[23:26] for the individual how they're going to
[23:27] react and interact within reality
[23:29] their perception means a lot now with
[23:33] that said let me just kind of throw a
[23:34] little quick glance at this
[23:37] in the day and age that we're living in
[23:39] synthetic reality is the thing
[23:42] simulated reality is a thing virtual
[23:46] reality is a thing
[23:48] and we are more and more coming into a
[23:50] time when people can live
[23:52] almost the entirety of their social
[23:54] lives or the entirety of their lives
[23:56] caught up in a simulated reality
[24:00] with the filters that are available
[24:02] people can present themselves in a with
[24:04] a particular persona
[24:05] that they look a particular way that
[24:07] they have a particular lifestyle
[24:09] that they're rich or that they're
[24:10] extravagantly beautiful or that they're
[24:11] vacationing
[24:12] in a different place every week and they
[24:14] can actually begin to create a synthetic
[24:17] reality or a simulated reality or you
[24:19] can
[24:20] actually put on a headset and live in a
[24:23] virtual reality
[24:25] and you can immerse yourself in in games
[24:28] and
[24:28] and realities and role-playing and all
[24:30] these different things where people now
[24:32] are living
[24:32] in a simulated synthetic reality
[24:36] and that's that's the kind of life that
[24:38] we're living anymore where people would
[24:40] rather enjoy something simulated
[24:42] synthetic or virtual
[24:43] instead of just enjoy life
[24:48] and so that's that i just want you to
[24:49] think about that
[24:51] now in first john chapter 3 verse 16.
[24:55] i like i like the symmetry with john 3
[24:57] 16.
[24:58] but first john 3 16 because john 3 16
[25:00] for god so loved the world and now first
[25:02] john 3 16 hereby
[25:04] perceive we the love of god this is how
[25:08] we perceive his love this is how we know
[25:10] his love
[25:11] because he laid down his life for us and
[25:14] he says and he's dealing with brother
[25:15] love and we ought to lay down our lives
[25:16] for the brethren
[25:19] now when john uses the word perceive
[25:22] because
[25:23] when we say perception is reality i i've
[25:26] cast a little bit of aspersion on i
[25:28] realize maybe i've clouded it a little
[25:29] bit that maybe perception is bad
[25:32] if your perception is wrong then it's
[25:34] not reality
[25:36] and with the wrong perception you can
[25:39] act
[25:39] incorrectly within the reality
[25:42] then but if your perception's right then
[25:45] it ought to
[25:46] cause you to act correctly within the
[25:48] reality
[25:50] now so it's not it's not let's just
[25:52] become dull and not perceive at all we
[25:53] just want to have the right kind of
[25:54] discernment sensitivity but i want to
[25:56] make this point when john uses the word
[25:58] perceived it's not me
[26:00] speaking uh merely of perception or
[26:03] knowing facts it's something deeper
[26:06] to the the guinosko is the word that's
[26:09] used here
[26:10] and the word knowledge or gonosco that
[26:11] with this this word is used to a greek
[26:14] when they would use the word knowledge
[26:16] they would just be referring to facts
[26:19] but the knowledge of those facts didn't
[26:21] necessarily have to move one person's
[26:23] behavior
[26:24] a person's behavior one way or another
[26:26] so to to a greek or to a gentile
[26:29] you may know something but it would not
[26:31] necessarily affect your conduct
[26:34] so knowledge in that sense was
[26:36] inconsequential but to a jew
[26:38] if a jew uses the word knowledge as john
[26:40] here is saying hereby perceive we
[26:42] hereby we know knowledge we have this
[26:45] knowledge of the love of god
[26:46] to a jew true knowledge always
[26:48] manifested itself in conduct
[26:51] that if someone actually and truly knew
[26:53] something
[26:54] it had a practical outworking in their
[26:56] life
[26:57] so to a greek maybe some you could say
[26:59] that yeah i know the house is on fire
[27:03] and you can literally stay in a house on
[27:05] fire
[27:06] yeah i know this ship is sinking yeah i
[27:08] know our days are numbered yeah i know
[27:10] this isn't going to last very long but
[27:13] who cares a greek could do that but to a
[27:16] jew they would say no
[27:17] you don't really know buddy you don't
[27:20] really perceive you don't really have a
[27:22] have a grasp because if you really knew
[27:24] the house is on fire
[27:25] you would get out of there so when john
[27:28] says hereby perceive we the love of god
[27:31] if he's using in a way that is deeper
[27:34] than just maybe the knowledge of a fact
[27:37] so let me say it this way if we truly
[27:39] know as he says hereby perceive you the
[27:41] love of god because he laid down his
[27:42] life for us if we truly know he died for
[27:44] us
[27:45] while we were yet sinners and i took a
[27:49] whole page of my notes out but i still
[27:50] want to just kind of throw this out
[27:52] there
[27:52] think about this that he died for us
[27:57] and we look that's looking backwards he
[27:58] died for us those of us who were yet
[28:00] coming
[28:02] so he died then for people who were not
[28:05] even here
[28:07] so you who were coming influenced what
[28:09] was happening then
[28:12] and go all the way back and i want to
[28:13] substantiate this by scripture go all
[28:15] the way back
[28:16] when was the lamb slain before the
[28:18] foundation of the world
[28:19] why was it slain because something that
[28:21] was coming
[28:23] think about it that your your sins then
[28:28] provoke the need and the intent of god
[28:31] before
[28:31] there was ever a speck of stardust to
[28:34] slay the lamb
[28:37] you don't think your future should do
[28:38] something
[28:40] he said if we know that he died for us
[28:42] while we were yet sinners
[28:44] therein that is where the knowledge of
[28:46] his love lies that if we know that then
[28:48] we know his love
[28:51] and it ought to provoke and produce a an
[28:54] absolute standing
[28:56] it should produce a state of confidence
[28:58] it should give us a north star
[29:00] where we can always get our bearings
[29:02] straight we can always orient ourselves
[29:04] regardless of the current circumstances
[29:06] regardless of the situation that we're
[29:08] in
[29:09] there's something that we could point to
[29:10] and be tethered to and say i know that
[29:12] he loves me well how do you know that he
[29:13] loves me he sent his son to die for me
[29:16] now that may seem to be real shallow
[29:17] christianity brother aaron don't you
[29:19] know the seals are open
[29:20] what does the open of the seals
[29:22] vindicate
[29:23] it's the second part of redemption what
[29:25] was the first part that sacrifice
[29:27] you can't rub that sacrifice out and do
[29:29] away with it and think that we can just
[29:31] you know hit parade about the seals
[29:32] being opened they they mean nothing
[29:35] without the cross they mean nothing
[29:37] without calvary they mean nothing
[29:38] without salvation they're connected
[29:40] together you cannot divide them
[29:42] and so we still have a north star that
[29:44] we're connected to
[29:45] since i am connected with calvary that
[29:48] my name is made known
[29:49] in the open of that book if i don't have
[29:52] a connection to calvary the opening of
[29:54] the book means nothing to me
[29:57] so we have an absolute standing now i'm
[30:00] going to read
[30:01] uh two lengthy statements to you and
[30:04] this
[30:04] is this is part of the whole burden that
[30:06] i've been looking at in this subject of
[30:08] pure joy
[30:09] and i'd like to take time in looking at
[30:12] different parts of these statements
[30:15] brother banham says this and i hope i'm
[30:16] just able to kind of read through it and
[30:18] not get hung up too much
[30:19] how can god how can god be just in love
[30:22] and if he stands by and watches his
[30:24] people suffer
[30:26] okay fair question someone may wrestle
[30:28] with that may try to figure that out
[30:32] he began he reads the scripture malachi
[30:33] chapter one verses one to three
[30:35] that i wanted to come to this part this
[30:36] is the proposition how can
[30:38] he be just and love him if we suffer you
[30:41] see they could not figure out god's love
[30:45] trying to perceive it trying to make
[30:46] sense of it they thought that love meant
[30:49] no suffering they thought that love
[30:51] meant a baby with parental care
[30:53] they thought that if god loved them he
[30:55] would not let him suffer they thought
[30:56] that if god loved
[30:59] them then as a parent would want to baby
[31:01] and nurture and cuddle a newborn that's
[31:03] what the love of god would be always
[31:05] but god said that his love was elective
[31:07] love the proof of his love
[31:09] is election that no matter what happened
[31:13] think about this his love was proven
[31:15] truly by the fact that
[31:17] that they were chosen under salvation
[31:20] because god had chosen you to salvation
[31:21] through sanctification of the spirit and
[31:22] belief of the truth and that's quote in
[31:23] scripture
[31:24] then he says so we're chosen as
[31:26] salvation he may commit you to death as
[31:28] he did paul
[31:29] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[31:31] job that is his prerogative
[31:33] he is sovereign but it is all with the
[31:36] purpose
[31:38] this is this is where the perception of
[31:40] god's love gets
[31:41] unwound is i'm suffering but if it's
[31:43] disconnected with purpose then all
[31:45] you're going to get is suffering
[31:46] because it's just pain for the purpose
[31:48] of pain it's just suffering for the
[31:50] outcome of suffering it's tribulation a
[31:52] trial of torment for the sake of torment
[31:54] but brother i'm saying but he does it
[31:55] all with the purpose
[31:56] if he did not have a purpose then he
[31:58] would be the author of frustration
[32:00] and not of peace but jesus is the
[32:04] author and finisher of our faith and so
[32:07] our suffering and what we endure and
[32:09] what we go through has something to do
[32:11] with either the beginning of our faith
[32:13] the perfecting of our faith
[32:14] and the finishing of our faith
[32:16] everything that we go through
[32:18] god stands there as the great guide and
[32:20] shepherd and he's making movements and
[32:22] doing things to see that we get where we
[32:24] need to go
[32:26] and god's not one to over correct and
[32:28] end up in a ditch
[32:30] he knows just how to gently guide he
[32:31] knows just how to navigate he knows just
[32:33] what to do
[32:34] he's a kind shepherd it's a tender hand
[32:36] of jehovah he knows when he has to
[32:37] really put the pressure on he knows when
[32:39] he needs to ease up
[32:40] god knows what he's doing and so if
[32:42] you're committed to something
[32:44] and you're going through something and
[32:45] you're experiencing distressing emotions
[32:47] you're experiencing rejection
[32:48] you're experiencing physical pain we can
[32:51] believe and we must be certain of and
[32:53] know
[32:53] that number one he loves us and that
[32:56] what i'm going through is not god
[32:58] telling me he doesn't love me
[33:00] and the reason why we feel that way is
[33:03] because we think that god's love is like
[33:05] the love we've experienced from humans
[33:07] but let me say you do god a tremendous
[33:09] disservice
[33:10] if you think he loves like man
[33:14] he's not vindictive he's not emotionally
[33:17] abusive and manipulative
[33:19] i think so many of us have experienced
[33:21] narcissistic love in our lives
[33:23] and we just expect god to be that way
[33:25] that god is the great narcissist
[33:27] oh he's gonna he's gonna gaslight me now
[33:29] oh he's gonna give me he's gonna
[33:31] he's gonna give me the cold shoulder and
[33:33] he's gonna do this and he's gonna do
[33:34] that no
[33:35] do not attribute human emotion to god
[33:40] so i am confident then when i'm
[33:42] suffering he loves me
[33:43] number two that in the suffering he has
[33:46] a purpose
[33:48] so i have no further distress
[33:51] questioning his love for me and now just
[33:54] as
[33:55] jesus who for the joy was set before him
[33:57] was able to endure affliction because it
[33:59] had a purpose
[34:00] now it changes my perception of what i'm
[34:03] going through
[34:04] i'm still perceiving pain but i started
[34:06] saying no pain no gain
[34:08] right this is the stage that i'm in
[34:11] right now this is what i'm going through
[34:13] this is what's happening
[34:14] but all my even though i'm going through
[34:16] it i can look beyond it for the gains
[34:18] that are coming
[34:19] i can look beyond it for the joy that
[34:21] has come i can look beyond it knowing
[34:22] that there's a purpose in this
[34:26] because if we didn't have that all that
[34:27] it would produce is frustration and
[34:29] peace not and a lack of peace
[34:32] so then he makes this statement and this
[34:33] is a little bit later in the same
[34:34] chapter
[34:35] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[34:37] no signs of god's disapproval
[34:42] now let me just say this to many of us
[34:45] we have perceived these words
[34:49] all right i take it back i'm sorry our
[34:51] neighbors in the apartment next door
[34:54] and me just me today just pray for it
[34:57] brother aaron
[34:59] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[35:01] no signs of god's disapproval
[35:04] okay neither the bright skies and still
[35:06] water signs of his love
[35:08] and approval his approval of any of us
[35:12] is in the beloved
[35:14] he love his love is elective which he
[35:16] had for us before the foundation of the
[35:18] world
[35:19] okay this is something we have to be
[35:20] certain of he says does he love us
[35:22] oh yes but how shall we know
[35:26] we shall know because he said so he's
[35:29] the only parent that really can just
[35:30] continue to get away with that i said so
[35:32] i believe it i believe it i believe it
[35:34] and manifested that he did love us
[35:37] for he brought us to himself gave us a
[35:39] spirit placing us his son so it was made
[35:41] manifest in that
[35:42] he sent us unto die for us we're
[35:43] experiencing his love through the new
[35:45] birth
[35:46] and he says and how shall i prove my
[35:48] love to him now why did he have to go
[35:50] and ask that question
[35:52] i felt really good in knowing that the
[35:54] cloudy skies and storms of life are not
[35:55] a vindication that he hates me or
[35:57] doesn't
[35:57] isn't proof that he doesn't love me and
[35:59] i took some comfort in knowing
[36:00] that i just don't have to have bright
[36:02] skies and still waters
[36:04] as a sign of his love and approval that
[36:05] was wonderful knowing his love for me
[36:08] and just working on that part and
[36:09] accepting that was great but now
[36:11] how do i prove his love to him my love
[36:12] to him
[36:14] by believing what he said all right okay
[36:17] we're good
[36:18] should we just sing take the name of
[36:19] jesus with with us i mean
[36:21] should we stop there because this is the
[36:22] part that hurts and by conducting myself
[36:26] with joy admits the trials that he and
[36:28] his wisdom allows to come to pass
[36:35] so sorry lord
[36:40] i feel like i've been an eeyore most of
[36:41] my christian life
[36:44] just everything is always so bad
[36:52] by conducting myself now how is my love
[36:55] this goes back to how i've perceived
[36:56] this love
[36:57] now if i'm fully confident in it if i'm
[37:00] if if it's growing if the depth of it's
[37:02] growing
[37:03] i believe what he said all right now i
[37:06] have a responsibility here's
[37:07] here's here's the proof that i know his
[37:09] love and and that
[37:11] as as i know that he loves me i love him
[37:13] because we love him because he
[37:14] first loved us so there's a connection
[37:16] here i have to conduct myself with joy
[37:21] admits the trials that he and his wisdom
[37:23] allows to come to pass
[37:25] that's a lot there right there's a whole
[37:27] lot there
[37:28] now what i've learned in my life
[37:32] is that you never have to sit back and
[37:34] try to figure out if
[37:36] this trial is the one that he's allowed
[37:39] in his wisdom
[37:41] well how do i know this is the one he
[37:43] allowed in his wisdom to come to pass
[37:45] if it's happening he's allowed it
[37:49] so every trial is a trial that he and
[37:52] his wisdom
[37:53] has allowed to come to pass so don't let
[37:55] that verbage kind of qualify towards
[37:57] like well i'm just trying to figure out
[37:58] if this is his wisdom or not no
[37:59] if he's allowed it it's his wisdom that
[38:02] allowed it if you're going through it if
[38:04] you're suffering if you're sick if
[38:05] you've lost something
[38:06] if you're experiencing pain or
[38:07] distressing emotions somehow
[38:09] god for some reason has let the devil do
[38:12] that he has let you do that he has let
[38:14] things take place and happen
[38:15] i lost this this happened i've suffered
[38:17] this i've gone through this treatment
[38:18] i've gone through that
[38:19] all these different things god in his
[38:20] wisdom said i'm going to allow this to
[38:22] come to pass
[38:23] so we do not need to engage in this
[38:25] exercise of trying to figure out
[38:27] whether or not this is a trial i need to
[38:29] conduct myself with joy in
[38:30] every trial in his wisdom he's allowed
[38:32] to come to pass therefore in every trial
[38:35] i must conduct myself with joy
[38:38] but how in the world can i do that
[38:42] how is that even possible
[38:45] and there just seems to be some people
[38:47] that just wake up in the morning like
[38:49] oh is this great i love recessions
[38:53] you know it's an opportunity you know
[38:56] like every day is just by the dip to
[38:58] them right
[38:58] you know they're never catching falling
[39:00] knives it's just always hey you know
[39:02] this great this wonderful pandemic that
[39:04] just means
[39:05] time to garden and ever they're always
[39:07] just happy and oh well
[39:09] when one door closes there's always
[39:11] another one that opens and
[39:12] you know i'm pretty handy i can always
[39:14] put a window here and get out they're
[39:15] just
[39:15] that's just the way they are
[39:18] right they just live that way
[39:22] and then it seems like most of us were
[39:25] easily affected
[39:28] by negative things and bad things that
[39:30] are happening and pandemics and sickness
[39:32] and sorrow and we just
[39:33] we don't find ourselves in every
[39:35] situation like well isn't that wonderful
[39:38] i heard a story one time of this sister
[39:40] i think she was in flagstaff who never
[39:42] had a negative thing to say so they
[39:43] wanted to kind of
[39:44] trip her up one time and she said well
[39:46] what do you think about the devil she
[39:48] said oh
[39:49] he's a perfect adversary
[39:54] so let's let's focus on what he's saying
[39:58] here then
[39:58] my conduct
[40:02] admits the trials that he allows to come
[40:04] to pass
[40:06] ought to be one of joy
[40:09] therefore my joy is not the product of
[40:11] my current circumstances
[40:15] but it is a condition that is born from
[40:17] my future
[40:20] if if think of it and i'm just wanting
[40:23] to unpack what brother brown is trying
[40:24] to say here
[40:25] it's not that we look at what we're
[40:27] going through and derive this
[40:29] you know handwriting pleasure from
[40:31] licking the chops like all this is so
[40:32] great i can't wait till they come up
[40:33] with covet 21.
[40:36] that's not what we do and anticipate
[40:38] calamity and destruction and catastrophe
[40:42] and like that kind of chaos we just know
[40:45] that right now though things are chaotic
[40:47] and things are uncertain
[40:48] i'm looking beyond it to something that
[40:51] i know is certain
[40:53] there and there's something about that
[40:54] reality
[40:56] that can produce a joy in the midst of
[40:58] my current situation
[41:00] so my joy conducting myself with joy
[41:03] acknowledges that i'm in the midst of a
[41:04] trial
[41:06] but recognizes that since he's allowed
[41:08] it to come to pass he must have a
[41:09] purpose
[41:10] and then that purpose being forward
[41:12] looking and that purpose being in the
[41:13] future
[41:14] it bursts that purpose now burst forth
[41:17] into my present state
[41:18] and i can have joy knowing that there's
[41:20] a purpose in this
[41:23] look at this in the scripture in luke
[41:24] chapter 9 verse 62
[41:26] says jesus said unto him no man having
[41:28] put his hand to the plow and looking
[41:30] back
[41:30] is fit for the kingdom so we ought not
[41:33] to live our lives looking back on our
[41:34] past
[41:35] mistakes and our regrets and and if a
[41:37] man is always looking at the road behind
[41:39] him he's going to deviate his course
[41:40] going forward
[41:41] he's like man why is this row so crooked
[41:43] i can't figure out why
[41:45] because he's not looking ahead he's
[41:47] always looking at it but if he could
[41:48] just put his eyes
[41:49] on that row and stay at a fixed point on
[41:51] the horizon he could go in a straight
[41:53] line
[41:54] so this this introduces this thought of
[41:57] how that
[41:58] labor is conducted with the future in
[42:00] view
[42:03] anybody here have a job
[42:06] anybody here not getting paid for that
[42:07] job that's called volunteer work
[42:12] uh and are you getting school are you
[42:14] getting credit for that you know
[42:16] it's got to be some payoff right if
[42:19] you're not getting paid for your labor
[42:20] that's slavery that's bondage
[42:23] that's servitude there's there's no joy
[42:26] in that there's no
[42:27] if i'm just going out and and working
[42:29] for somebody and there's nothing in
[42:31] return
[42:31] then that i don't derive any benefit
[42:33] from that so the labor
[42:35] always looks forward not behind that's
[42:38] that's why sometimes contracts are
[42:39] structured the way that they are if you
[42:40] get paid up front then you got
[42:42] the payments in the past it's really
[42:44] hard to do the work
[42:46] knowing that there's not a payment
[42:47] coming you say well i gave you 10 grand
[42:49] to do the job why don't you do the job
[42:50] yeah but there's not 10 grand coming now
[42:54] and that's why they structure contracts
[42:55] the way they do it's to provide the
[42:57] incentive for the person to finish the
[42:59] job why
[43:00] because we be humans and we need that
[43:06] and so as jesus is using this image of a
[43:08] farmer the sower
[43:10] has the harvest before him as he labors
[43:14] in the winter in the spring and the
[43:15] summer
[43:16] so think of all these weeks and months
[43:18] all these days of difficult labor it
[43:20] begins even in the winter it continues
[43:22] into the spring
[43:23] and then through the hottest times of
[43:25] the year in the summer there's this
[43:26] tremendous
[43:27] labor and exerting and effort that's put
[43:30] into it
[43:30] and at the time there doesn't seem to be
[43:32] anything you're getting back
[43:34] all the labor that goes into disking up
[43:36] the field and removing the rocks and
[43:37] turning over the soil and
[43:39] doing this and doing that and then
[43:40] planting the crops and then watering
[43:42] them
[43:42] and making sure there's irrigation and
[43:44] making sure they're treated right and
[43:45] every day this great care and this
[43:47] effort
[43:48] and every day there's no immediate
[43:49] benefit of return
[43:52] but what does the farmer do he envisions
[43:54] the harvest
[43:56] and the harvest in view is what helps
[43:59] him
[44:01] plant and work in labor every day
[44:04] so the reality of the future changes his
[44:07] condition
[44:08] in his current circumstances the reality
[44:10] that there is a harvest
[44:12] the fact that there is going to be a
[44:13] harvest colors
[44:15] the days of the spring and gives those
[44:18] days meaning
[44:20] the reality of the harvest paints the
[44:22] days of the summer
[44:23] and gives you a determination and a
[44:25] purpose in working in the summer
[44:27] if there was no harvest then what's the
[44:29] real purpose of getting up that early
[44:31] what's the real meaning of doing this
[44:32] and doing that there has to be a meaning
[44:34] to it
[44:35] so it's the end result why labor why
[44:38] toil why fight why struggle
[44:40] because of the reward of the harvest and
[44:42] paul says in first corinthians 9 10
[44:45] he that ploweth should plow in hope
[44:49] i'm liking this to how we live in the
[44:51] midst of trials that we're going through
[44:53] we should go through them in hope he
[44:56] that thresheth
[44:57] in hope should be a partaker of his
[44:59] hopes
[45:01] so this is in using this image of a
[45:03] farmer one who labors should envision
[45:05] the harvest
[45:06] so that you are plowing in hope he who's
[45:10] threshing the grain
[45:11] thrashes in hope that he might be a
[45:13] partaker of the end result
[45:16] therefore if you plow in hope and you
[45:18] thresh in hope
[45:19] then you will not be sorrowful and you
[45:21] will not be sad
[45:22] or grieving in your labor but you'll
[45:24] know there's a payday coming
[45:26] there's a day coming there's a reward
[45:28] coming
[45:31] because the hope here is not this
[45:33] negative enemy of faith hope means faith
[45:36] it's actually translated to faith in one
[45:38] place it's expectation of good the word
[45:40] hope here means joyful
[45:42] confident expectation so if you're
[45:44] plowing
[45:45] in hope it serves as a motivator if
[45:48] you're thrashing in hope
[45:49] it serves as a sustainer hope actually
[45:52] at the time
[45:53] has an energy you're not actually eating
[45:57] the corn you're not actually eating the
[45:59] grain you're not in the in the moment
[46:01] benefiting from the harvest but you're
[46:03] actually getting an early return on it
[46:05] because the fact that it's going to be
[46:07] encourages you now oh no i'm in a plant
[46:10] i'm going to sow i'm going to work i'm
[46:12] going to labor how can you do that
[46:13] there's a reward coming
[46:14] you don't see the light at the end of
[46:16] the tunnel you don't see the payoff
[46:17] coming
[46:18] and that the the fact that there's
[46:19] something coming takes the sting
[46:22] of the labor away from it
[46:26] and that's exactly what is meant when
[46:28] who for the joy that was set before him
[46:31] it says the hope of christ was his
[46:34] source of joy
[46:35] and that is why we must look to him that
[46:38] is why we ought to
[46:39] consider him because here's christ
[46:42] enduring the shameful humiliation of a
[46:44] crucifixion
[46:45] enduring the bitter hostility of sinners
[46:48] and he for the joy who is which was set
[46:50] before
[46:50] was able to look past that and know in
[46:52] his present state
[46:54] that he was comforted by god's purpose
[46:56] and he could face it bravely
[46:58] didn't run from it
[47:02] the bible says in first corinthians
[47:03] chapter nine
[47:06] you feel me all right
[47:09] because this is this is fantastic stuff
[47:12] i well i think that that word kind of
[47:15] suggests maybe a fantasy it's wonderful
[47:18] stuff
[47:20] first corinthians chapter 2 verses 9 to
[47:21] 10. i i'd like to go quicker now
[47:24] but as it is you said quicker how can
[47:25] you do that
[47:27] but as it is written i have not seen nor
[47:29] ear heard
[47:31] neither have entered into the heart of
[47:32] men the things that god had prepared for
[47:34] them that love him
[47:36] we cannot use our finite minds we cannot
[47:38] use our natural senses
[47:40] to imagine eternity we cannot use
[47:43] the senses of our spirit and the senses
[47:45] of our flesh to grasp eternal things
[47:49] right this is what the scripture is
[47:50] saying eye hasn't seen ear hasn't heard
[47:52] neither has it entered our imaginations
[47:53] our thoughts
[47:54] the things which now god hath prepared
[47:58] for them that love him so preparation
[48:00] future forward looking
[48:02] for them that love him so i'm going to
[48:05] conduct
[48:06] how do i prove my love for him i conduct
[48:08] myself with joy it missed the trials
[48:10] that he and his wisdom allows to come to
[48:12] pass
[48:12] so now i cannot see nor ear hear
[48:16] neither can i imagine the things which
[48:18] god had prepared for them
[48:20] that love him so it's almost as if in
[48:22] one statement
[48:23] god has built up this wall to where we
[48:26] are just left
[48:27] knowing well there must be something
[48:29] he's prepared for me but i don't know
[48:31] what it is
[48:32] but it's only saying you don't know what
[48:34] it is by human effort
[48:36] or human endowment in verse 10 but god
[48:39] hath revealed them to us
[48:40] unto us by his spirit this is the part
[48:43] that you all you always have to read
[48:45] verse 10 if you're going to read verse
[48:46] 9.
[48:46] it says but god hath revealed them unto
[48:49] us by his spirit
[48:51] so of all the understanding of eternal
[48:53] life cannot be gained solely
[48:56] through the natural things around us and
[48:58] the things of natural life
[49:00] god still yet wants us to know them
[49:04] so he reveals them to us he reveals them
[49:07] to us by his spirit and the spirit
[49:09] searcheth all things yea the deep things
[49:11] of god
[49:12] so god if you love god he's prepared
[49:15] something for
[49:16] you so though you may be here presently
[49:18] in something
[49:19] there is a preparation in the future and
[49:21] god does not want that preparation to be
[49:24] a total mystery
[49:25] so he reveals it to you now
[49:28] consider this why would he reveal it to
[49:30] you
[49:33] so though we do not understand eternal
[49:35] life to the things that we're going
[49:36] through or through natural life
[49:38] but rather the things that he has
[49:40] prepared or the things that lay before
[49:42] us
[49:42] help us to understand why things are the
[49:45] way they are
[49:46] here we cannot understand
[49:49] eternity through this life but by
[49:52] understanding eternity
[49:53] we can understand this life
[49:57] let me try to say it just another way
[50:00] we're not going to be able to understand
[50:01] eternity better
[50:03] by what we're going through here but as
[50:05] you
[50:06] understand eternity better you can
[50:08] better understand what you're going
[50:09] through here though it's future
[50:13] though it's something just seems to be
[50:14] beyond the things
[50:16] that will be help us to understand why
[50:19] things are
[50:20] the way they are why does he reveal to
[50:23] us
[50:24] the things that are prepared so that the
[50:26] future changes our present
[50:30] so that you conduct you can conduct
[50:32] yourself with joy
[50:33] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[50:35] allows to come to pass how is he going
[50:36] to do it not from your past
[50:38] but from your future
[50:41] so he that plows plows in hope he that
[50:44] threshes
[50:45] does so in hope there's joy now because
[50:48] there's joy ahead
[50:50] if i know there's a land coming where
[50:52] this joy shall never end
[50:54] if there's joy ahead there's joy now
[50:59] it says in hebrews chapter 11 verses 13
[51:02] to 16
[51:03] talking about the heroes of faith these
[51:04] all died in the faith having not
[51:06] received the promises
[51:07] i i need to i just want to okay i want
[51:10] you to catch what he says
[51:11] but having seen them afar off think
[51:14] about everything they went through
[51:16] having not taken possession but seeing
[51:17] them afar off were persuaded them and
[51:19] embraced them
[51:20] and confess that they were strangers and
[51:22] pilgrims on earth for they that say such
[51:24] things declare plainly that they seek a
[51:26] country
[51:28] it was something still coming but notice
[51:30] what it did it pulled them through all
[51:31] sorts of tragedies
[51:32] they even died in the faith and death
[51:35] was not evidence of a lack of faith
[51:37] they died in the faith
[51:41] even now for a believer we look past on
[51:43] on tragedies and we look at how
[51:45] we've lost loved ones to terrible things
[51:47] whether it be suicides or accidents and
[51:49] we look back
[51:50] and we wrestle with it and we can we can
[51:52] grieve over it and try to haunt us but
[51:54] they there's people
[51:55] who die in the faith but god does it all
[51:58] with a purpose
[52:02] people who declare these things are
[52:03] plainly seeking another country he says
[52:05] and truly if they had been mindful of
[52:07] that country from where they came out if
[52:09] they were thinking about it
[52:10] and that's what they were looking for
[52:12] and that's what they cared about the
[52:13] country they left
[52:14] they might have had an opportunity to
[52:15] just go back but they weren't backwards
[52:18] looking
[52:20] they weren't they weren't mindful of
[52:21] what they left they looked to something
[52:22] where they were going to
[52:24] even everything that you lose here
[52:26] you've already won there
[52:28] because god restores a hundredfold in
[52:30] this life and the life to come
[52:32] so whatever i lose here i know i got
[52:34] more coming i can't wait to the
[52:35] the brush i need in heaven all right i
[52:38] ain't lost to one of them
[52:39] but there's something you may lose it
[52:41] here but you're looking forward to it
[52:42] there
[52:43] you know that whatever i've lost here
[52:44] i've already won there
[52:46] so though they left family they left
[52:48] homes they left this they knew
[52:49] everything that they lost
[52:50] they knew they were going to a land
[52:52] where there was family there was homes
[52:53] there was lands there was an inheritance
[52:55] and so they didn't look backwards and it
[52:57] says that but now they desire
[53:00] a better country that is a heavenly
[53:03] wherefore god is not ashamed to be
[53:04] called their god
[53:06] for he have prepared for them a city
[53:09] so they left one city looking for
[53:12] another city and even if they never
[53:14] found it they weren't wrong because god
[53:15] had prepared it
[53:17] and it was that kind of vision it was
[53:19] that kind of desire is that kind of
[53:21] looking forward that gave them the
[53:22] determination and the sustaining power
[53:25] they labored in hope to see what god had
[53:28] prepared
[53:30] so let me say this the reality of our
[53:33] eternity
[53:34] ought to impose itself on our present
[53:38] the reality of where we're going the
[53:40] reality of what we're called to
[53:42] the reality of what we will be the
[53:44] reality that we are going to be in
[53:45] perfectly healthy bodies
[53:47] the reality that we'll be in perfectly
[53:48] sound minds the reality that we will
[53:50] have a perfect and pure joy
[53:52] that reality ought to impress itself
[53:55] upon this reality
[53:58] and what is to be ought to change what
[54:02] is now
[54:05] it should impact how we feel impact how
[54:08] we act and interact with the things that
[54:10] are present
[54:13] brother branham says in things that are
[54:14] to be
[54:18] he says last night speaking over in yuma
[54:21] for the christian businessmen
[54:23] i spoke on the subject of the rapture
[54:25] now that might have been a strange
[54:27] subject to speak among at a banquet
[54:30] but most everyone there was christians
[54:34] and that's the way it is on these
[54:35] campaigns like this or in a church i can
[54:38] say now how many of you as christians
[54:40] probably every hand would go up you're a
[54:42] christian
[54:44] and so if we're christians
[54:48] i think we ought to be kindly notified
[54:50] ahead
[54:52] i think this is the reason why he
[54:53] preaches the rapture
[54:55] i'm so thankful for that message the
[54:58] rapture
[55:00] i think we should be notified ahead of
[55:01] time we don't have to just
[55:04] guess at it we are notified what our
[55:07] destination
[55:08] will be this
[55:11] so we're christians so he preaches the
[55:14] rapture everyone there was christians
[55:16] so i felt that christians should know
[55:18] what's happening
[55:21] and they should be notified what is
[55:22] happening
[55:24] and he says so we're notified what our
[55:25] destination will be and i want to speak
[55:27] on that tonight
[55:28] and the subject is going to be things
[55:30] that are to be
[55:32] now why would we need to know this is i
[55:34] just want you to catch this because i'm
[55:35] going to try to wrap this up
[55:37] sooner and i'm going to skip over a
[55:38] number of different things and we'll get
[55:39] to it another another time
[55:41] why would he preach things that are to
[55:43] be
[55:45] to people who are going through things
[55:46] now
[55:48] he says and now speaking last night on
[55:49] the rapture so tonight i want to speak
[55:51] on this subject things that would be
[55:53] that i might tie it together with last
[55:55] night's message
[55:56] now there's going to be a rapture we
[55:58] know that that's in the future to be so
[56:02] the the things that pertain there's
[56:03] things that are part of this rapture
[56:05] that's going to be
[56:06] so he's saying that i want to tie this
[56:08] in so things that are to be
[56:09] is a continuation of him preaching on
[56:11] the rapture
[56:12] because there's no question when he
[56:14] preaches the rapture what is the shout
[56:16] he identifies it there's things
[56:18] transpiring there's still things yet
[56:19] that are going to happen
[56:20] but we still need to know what will be
[56:24] why because what will be is what changes
[56:27] what is
[56:40] so god informs us beforehand
[56:44] and we ought to be notified beforehand
[56:45] what our destination will be
[56:49] he's tying this together the rapture
[56:51] seeing that this rapture
[56:53] is how he taught it he preaches things
[56:56] are to be
[56:56] why because things that would be have
[56:58] something to do with this rapture
[57:01] it's related it's connected and he uses
[57:03] this phrase that we ought to be notified
[57:05] beforehand what our destination will be
[57:07] like
[57:09] and in doing so the future
[57:12] impacts us presently
[57:16] try this with your your kids tell them
[57:19] someday this week get up we're going to
[57:21] the doctor you're getting vaccinated
[57:22] vaccine shots
[57:24] find out how quick they get out of bed
[57:25] right
[57:27] or just say come on get get up let's go
[57:28] we're leaving
[57:29] [Music]
[57:31] but tell them hey we're going to
[57:32] chick-fil-a
[57:35] you know then they're with their cow
[57:36] suits on er let's get this thing going
[57:44] because they know where they're going
[57:46] and all of a sudden it doesn't matter
[57:47] that it's so early
[57:53] so what happens think about this
[57:56] the destination
[58:00] determines their present conduct
[58:04] why he preaches the rapture then he
[58:06] preaches things that are to be because
[58:07] the revelation will cause
[58:09] the proper manner of preparation
[58:12] produces the proper expectation the
[58:14] proper enthusiasm the proper hope
[58:18] let me use this as an example if you're
[58:19] going to go on a trip you don't pay
[58:22] you don't pack based upon the weather
[58:24] where you are
[58:27] you pack based upon the weather where
[58:29] you're going
[58:32] and and that's why you could be and
[58:34] maybe brother loyal can testify to this
[58:35] you're up there in minnesota in the
[58:36] middle of the winter and you're at the
[58:37] airport and you see somebody in
[58:39] sandals and linen pants and a hawaiian
[58:41] shirt and you're like
[58:42] man we just got out of negative you know
[58:45] 32 below
[58:46] temperature and it's like you know
[58:47] exactly where this guy's going
[58:49] he's headed south not his life you know
[58:53] you know it's like an allegory of
[58:54] destruction coming oh he's
[58:56] he's wanting to go south for the winter
[58:57] he's going to go into hawaii people
[58:59] dress
[59:00] based upon where they're going people
[59:03] act
[59:04] based upon where they're going you see
[59:06] somebody who's all
[59:07] you know wearing all orange and their
[59:09] hands are behind their back and they're
[59:10] wearing these funny looking slippers
[59:12] why they're going to jail hey
[59:16] they dress and act where they're going
[59:17] but then you find somebody else who's
[59:19] dressed all
[59:20] you know restful and relaxed and they
[59:21] got their linen pants on and a hawaiian
[59:24] shirt and a a you know a nice hat and
[59:26] sunglasses
[59:27] they're prepared and ready for where
[59:29] they're going
[59:31] so you pack and prepare based upon not
[59:33] your point of departure
[59:35] the way things are but based upon what
[59:38] will be
[59:40] you prepare not for the way things are
[59:42] but for the way things are going to be
[59:44] why do you live that way the way things
[59:45] are going to be why do you act that way
[59:47] the way things are going to be
[59:49] why are you happy the way things are
[59:50] going to be
[59:52] i'm not going to live under the cloud of
[59:54] a pandemic i'm not going to live under a
[59:55] cloud of a recession i'm not going to
[59:57] live under a cloud of difficult things
[59:58] why
[59:59] things are going to be better
[1:00:02] that's what i'm living under and when
[1:00:05] someone's going on a vacation they get
[1:00:07] all excited
[1:00:09] i need to look and say hey man joe oh
[1:00:11] you're pretty happy today you're really
[1:00:13] throwing those boxes
[1:00:14] around man are you just you're just
[1:00:15] happy it's friday nope i'm going on
[1:00:17] vacation next week
[1:00:19] let's get this job done uh-huh
[1:00:22] it changes the way they work it changes
[1:00:23] the way they labor wow just what's
[1:00:25] coming
[1:00:26] what's next how much more are we to be
[1:00:29] as christians
[1:00:30] that if there's an excitement and
[1:00:32] there's an anticipation that overwhelms
[1:00:34] a person who's under positive
[1:00:35] expectation
[1:00:36] when they're going on a vacation then
[1:00:38] how much more
[1:00:40] should it be for people who are going to
[1:00:42] take a translation
[1:00:44] how much more should the things that are
[1:00:46] to be changed the way that things are
[1:00:47] now
[1:00:49] he says in john chapter 14 verses 1 to 3
[1:00:52] let not your heart be troubled
[1:00:54] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:00:56] that's the first part of proving our
[1:00:58] love to him
[1:00:59] but his subject is don't let your hearts
[1:01:00] be troubled in my father's house or many
[1:01:03] mansions this was his message to comfort
[1:01:05] a troubled heart
[1:01:06] oh don't worry you're not going to go
[1:01:07] through anything that's not what he said
[1:01:08] oh don't worry
[1:01:09] i mean they won't really agree with you
[1:01:11] but theologically you'll find some basis
[1:01:13] of fellowship and you'll all get along
[1:01:15] oh no they'll think it's wonderful that
[1:01:16] you're starting a church oh no no
[1:01:18] they'll
[1:01:18] they're right they'll be right there
[1:01:19] with you brother they're going to be
[1:01:21] they're going to support you they're
[1:01:22] going to lift you up they're gonna
[1:01:23] encourage you after all we're bride
[1:01:24] right
[1:01:25] you know he says he he doesn't tell him
[1:01:27] lies
[1:01:30] he says let not your heart be troubled
[1:01:32] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:01:34] no matter what you're going through here
[1:01:35] remember there's something there
[1:01:38] you're living for something that's next
[1:01:40] in my father's house or many mansions if
[1:01:42] it were not so i would have told you
[1:01:44] i go to prepare a place for you and if i
[1:01:46] go and prepare a place for you
[1:01:47] i'll come again and receive you unto
[1:01:49] myself now this phrase means something
[1:01:51] different to me right now
[1:01:53] for where i am there you may be also
[1:01:57] all sudden i didn't look at his future
[1:01:58] anymore
[1:02:00] i'm telling you now that i've gone to
[1:02:02] prepare a place for you
[1:02:03] and i've told you that now so that you
[1:02:07] wouldn't have
[1:02:07] i told you that that will be so that you
[1:02:09] wouldn't have troubled hearts now
[1:02:12] and that if you know that that's coming
[1:02:15] then no matter where you are you can be
[1:02:17] where i am
[1:02:21] if you can believe that's coming then
[1:02:23] you can have me
[1:02:24] where you are if you can say what a day
[1:02:28] that will be then what it changes the
[1:02:30] day
[1:02:31] that is if you're fully convinced that
[1:02:33] there's coming a day
[1:02:34] and what a day that will be and one day
[1:02:37] i'll see my savior face to face
[1:02:38] and you know that that's going to happen
[1:02:40] then shoulders that are slumped down
[1:02:42] and backs that are aching and hands that
[1:02:45] are becoming weak
[1:02:46] all of a sudden straighten up and say
[1:02:47] yes sir that's right
[1:02:50] one day i'm gonna see my savior face to
[1:02:52] face
[1:02:56] things that will be are supposed to
[1:02:58] change the way things are
[1:03:01] our future changes our present
[1:03:05] i think we're way too quick to reach
[1:03:07] into our past
[1:03:08] to define who we are
[1:03:12] given an opportunity right now we're
[1:03:13] going to let you go into a room and we
[1:03:15] want i want you
[1:03:16] to paint the picture of who you are tell
[1:03:18] me who you are
[1:03:19] i'm going to give you building blocks
[1:03:21] and you choose who you are you know what
[1:03:22] we'll do we'll go to the bin of our past
[1:03:25] and pull out all the blocks from our
[1:03:27] past
[1:03:28] to try to make sense of who we are we'll
[1:03:31] take the paint brushes and the canvas
[1:03:32] and all the paint from our past
[1:03:34] and that's what we want to paint the
[1:03:35] picture of who we are and you're using
[1:03:37] the wrong tools
[1:03:39] we shouldn't reach into our past to
[1:03:41] define who we are we should reach into
[1:03:42] the future
[1:03:44] reach into the future to grab the
[1:03:45] resources reach into the future to grab
[1:03:47] the building blocks
[1:03:48] reach into the future i'm going to use
[1:03:50] that paint i'm going to use those blocks
[1:03:52] i'm going to use those materials
[1:03:53] that past isn't who i am i was winning
[1:03:57] then though it made it look like i was
[1:03:58] losing but that's who i really
[1:04:00] am and that's what i'm going to use to
[1:04:02] paint this picture
[1:04:06] why not use faith why not use revelation
[1:04:08] to paint a different picture than even
[1:04:10] what you see now
[1:04:13] take the take the building blocks and
[1:04:15] the materials of the future
[1:04:16] and build a different present
[1:04:21] we can if we're convinced of it
[1:04:24] if you know it's there and you know
[1:04:25] you've invested in it
[1:04:27] it's an investment that pays daily
[1:04:29] dividends
[1:04:30] it's the best dividend stock you can buy
[1:04:33] every day multiple times a day
[1:04:37] you're getting a dividend of it from
[1:04:38] eternity
[1:04:40] we should begin to draw from them now
[1:04:44] we can get a return our investment now
[1:04:47] it says in first corinthians chapter 15
[1:04:50] verses 54 to 58 what's what's so
[1:04:52] beautiful in this i've skipped a number
[1:04:53] of different things
[1:04:55] there's just so much more to look at
[1:04:56] this and this to see this
[1:05:00] just a few more scriptures first
[1:05:02] corinthians chapter 15 verses 54 to 58
[1:05:05] this is how that once again we could see
[1:05:07] a scriptural example of how that things
[1:05:09] that are going to be
[1:05:11] changed the way things are so when this
[1:05:14] corrupts
[1:05:15] shall put on incorruption and this
[1:05:16] mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:05:18] then shall be brought to pass the same
[1:05:20] that is death
[1:05:22] is swallowed up in victory so paul looks
[1:05:25] forward to that moment that when
[1:05:26] everything when we are changed
[1:05:28] completely because there's going to be a
[1:05:29] translation of this flesh he's saying
[1:05:31] then it's going to be brought to pass
[1:05:32] then it'll be finally satisfied that
[1:05:35] death is swelled up in victory
[1:05:38] but notice paul's next statement he
[1:05:40] doesn't say just wait one day
[1:05:43] you're going to get what's coming to you
[1:05:44] no he actually says
[1:05:46] oh death where's your sting now
[1:05:50] oh grave where is your victory now
[1:05:54] oh oh but i thought that it's going to
[1:05:56] be death is going to be swamp and
[1:05:57] victory then
[1:05:58] okay but victory ahead is victory now
[1:06:02] if it's going to be defeated then it's
[1:06:04] defeated now if it's going to be
[1:06:06] overthrown then it has no power now
[1:06:09] this is exactly what paul says he's not
[1:06:11] saying oh one day you'll lose your sting
[1:06:13] one day you'll lose your victory it's
[1:06:15] gone now because he says the sting of
[1:06:16] death is sin the strength of sin is the
[1:06:18] law
[1:06:19] but thanks be to god who will
[1:06:22] give us the victory one day further down
[1:06:24] the road we're not sure when could be
[1:06:26] thousands of years through jesus christ
[1:06:30] that could be in the hiv bible but it's
[1:06:32] not in this one
[1:06:35] which give us us the victory through our
[1:06:38] lord jesus christ
[1:06:39] which who has given us it has been given
[1:06:43] yes one day everything will be fully
[1:06:46] summed up
[1:06:46] and it will happen that death is
[1:06:48] swallowed up completely in victory
[1:06:50] but that doesn't mean we don't have
[1:06:52] victory now because he has already given
[1:06:54] us the victory through jesus christ
[1:06:56] he says therefore my beloved brethren be
[1:06:58] ye steadfast
[1:06:59] unmovable always abound in the work of
[1:07:01] lord for as much as you know that your
[1:07:03] labor
[1:07:03] is not in vain in the lord in light of
[1:07:06] the fact that the victory ahead
[1:07:08] is victory now that it doesn't matter
[1:07:10] what may be
[1:07:11] here things that are to be changed
[1:07:13] things you can stand
[1:07:15] fast unmovable always abounded and
[1:07:18] fruitful in the work of the lord
[1:07:19] why because you know there's a reward
[1:07:20] coming
[1:07:23] you know your labor is not in vain
[1:07:27] do we believe that all things work
[1:07:28] together for the good
[1:07:30] do we really believe that
[1:07:33] then only things that can work for good
[1:07:36] can be
[1:07:40] if all things work together for the good
[1:07:43] then only things that can work for good
[1:07:46] can be
[1:07:48] there can be nothing in your life that
[1:07:50] can't be worked worked for good
[1:07:52] so don't worry don't fret don't be
[1:07:55] fearful
[1:07:57] tell eeyore goodbye
[1:08:00] i don't know if we need to be tigger or
[1:08:01] poo or what we would need to be in this
[1:08:02] scenario
[1:08:04] but we don't need to be or we don't need
[1:08:05] to be sad we don't be downtron
[1:08:07] oh woe is me i'm sad everything's
[1:08:09] horrible everything's miserable
[1:08:11] we can say you know what if it is
[1:08:14] then it will be good if it is
[1:08:17] then it will be good no matter what it
[1:08:19] is something's going to work with it i
[1:08:20] don't understand something's going to
[1:08:22] work with it
[1:08:22] so because whatever is can become good
[1:08:26] it's going to be worked somehow it has
[1:08:29] the potential for it has the promise of
[1:08:36] it things that will be change things
[1:08:46] brother branham says and things that are
[1:08:47] to be he says a real child of god is
[1:08:49] hungering and thirsting
[1:08:51] why if there's something in your heart
[1:08:53] telling you you want it
[1:08:55] and it needs there it shows there's
[1:08:58] something pulsating trying to pull you
[1:09:00] there
[1:09:01] there's a body there that this one is a
[1:09:03] type of here
[1:09:05] he says what are you using this one for
[1:09:09] to glorify the devil in the world and
[1:09:11] the fashions and things
[1:09:13] are you looking towards heaven there's
[1:09:16] something up there
[1:09:17] you're glorifying god with your life
[1:09:20] things that will be
[1:09:22] or changing things now
[1:09:25] because i'm not reflecting the world i'm
[1:09:26] not reflecting the devil i'm not
[1:09:27] reflecting a different destination
[1:09:29] i begin to reflect my destination
[1:09:33] and he quotes in my father's house are
[1:09:34] many mansions if it wasn't so i would
[1:09:37] have told you
[1:09:38] and i'll go and prepare a place for you
[1:09:40] and come again
[1:09:41] to receive you unto myself that where i
[1:09:44] am
[1:09:44] there you may be also things
[1:09:48] that are to be these things that are now
[1:09:52] are only potential calling for the
[1:09:56] things
[1:09:57] that is to be
[1:10:00] that creates this connection this is
[1:10:03] what i want to close on it the
[1:10:04] the brothers could come
[1:10:08] that if there is that we have
[1:10:12] the promise of things future
[1:10:16] that there we have a we should have a
[1:10:18] conviction and a confidence
[1:10:21] that he has made us assurances and that
[1:10:23] he will keep his promises
[1:10:27] there is a rapture there is going to be
[1:10:30] a translation there is a land beyond the
[1:10:31] river there is a body
[1:10:33] i've gone to repair prepare a place for
[1:10:34] you in my father's house are many
[1:10:36] mansions that is a new body
[1:10:40] if this wasn't so i would have told you
[1:10:41] that you don't have a place to go
[1:10:43] through paul even teaches it
[1:10:44] that if we didn't have something in the
[1:10:46] in the afterlife
[1:10:48] i'm trying to stay away from the rest of
[1:10:50] my notes that are here but if
[1:10:52] if we didn't have the promise of
[1:10:54] something after this he says we of all
[1:10:55] people would be
[1:10:57] the most miserable
[1:11:00] so let's invert
[1:11:03] if we didn't have that promise we would
[1:11:07] be the most miserable but since we
[1:11:10] do have that promise we should be the
[1:11:13] mostest happiest
[1:11:16] because we have that promise if we
[1:11:18] didn't we'd be the most visible but
[1:11:20] because we do we're the most happy
[1:11:22] why because of the promise because of
[1:11:25] the purpose
[1:11:26] because of the future things that will
[1:11:27] be changed the way that things are
[1:11:29] if a simulated reality a synthetic
[1:11:32] reality and a virtuality
[1:11:33] is changing the way that human minds
[1:11:35] think and interact
[1:11:36] and the reality that people live within
[1:11:38] then something that i know that is
[1:11:40] beyond real
[1:11:41] beyond real beyond real and more real
[1:11:44] than this world i'm living in now then
[1:11:45] let that
[1:11:46] open up let it radiate let it shine down
[1:11:49] and let it change the way i live in the
[1:11:51] way i act now
[1:11:54] and may i be convinced according to
[1:11:55] first corinthians 15
[1:11:57] that victory ahead is victory now
[1:11:59] victory ahead is victory now
[1:12:01] victory ahead is victory now joy ahead
[1:12:04] is joy now
[1:12:08] that are to be are calling to the
[1:12:11] potential
[1:12:12] of things now did you catch that
[1:12:16] things that are to be
[1:12:20] there's a call because the potential
[1:12:24] in things that are now
[1:12:28] in first peter chapter 1 verse 8
[1:12:31] speaking of jesus christ it says
[1:12:34] and having not seen you love
[1:12:37] and whom though now you see him not yet
[1:12:40] believing
[1:12:42] so though we have not met him
[1:12:45] in the air though we have not seen him
[1:12:47] after his flesh though we have not
[1:12:49] seen him we love him though we have not
[1:12:53] seen him we believe him
[1:12:56] we beloved him halloween love him
[1:12:59] because
[1:13:01] he because we believe his word how do we
[1:13:03] prove our love to him
[1:13:04] we've proven it because we believe his
[1:13:05] word so having not seen him we believe
[1:13:07] him
[1:13:07] that means we love him whom having not
[1:13:10] seen you love though you have not seen
[1:13:11] him
[1:13:11] you're believing you loved him it's
[1:13:13] proven by the fact that you
[1:13:15] believe him and he says ye rejoice
[1:13:20] though you have not seen them ye rejoice
[1:13:23] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:13:28] how could you have joy unspeakable and
[1:13:31] full of glory
[1:13:32] if you if if you did not have a
[1:13:35] revelation of him
[1:13:38] oh if i'm being kind of clumsy in how i
[1:13:40] deliver this
[1:13:42] listen you love him even though you
[1:13:44] don't see him and even though you have
[1:13:46] not seen him
[1:13:46] you still believe him and loving him and
[1:13:49] believing him
[1:13:50] you can conduct yourself with joy
[1:13:52] unspeakable
[1:13:53] and full of glory because he's revealed
[1:13:55] himself to you
[1:13:58] he has made himself known to you and
[1:14:00] that is your joy
[1:14:01] that is the impetus of praise that is
[1:14:03] the origin of our worship
[1:14:05] that is what i can say that in this
[1:14:07] there is good
[1:14:08] because i love him i believe his
[1:14:10] promises towards me
[1:14:11] and we are not waiting one day for joy

[1:15:48] some praise to him and some gratitude to
[1:15:51] him
[1:15:53] we pray we often we always try to pray
[1:15:55] to close the
[1:15:56] service and seal the things that have
[1:15:58] been ministered but let's just offer
[1:16:00] praise and thanksgiving together
[1:16:03] and and a prayer of praise and an
[1:16:05] offering however you would do it in your
[1:16:07] hearts
[1:16:09] joy unspeakable full of glory
[1:16:13] i'm challenging you today
[1:16:17] to not reach into your past to define
[1:16:19] who you are
[1:16:23] and to let you know that you have
[1:16:24] liberty to reach into your future
[1:16:28] to make who you are today we live under
[1:16:32] the bondage of our past
[1:16:34] don't get comfortable with that feeling
[1:16:36] don't become numb to the instinct to try
[1:16:38] to define yourself by your past
[1:16:40] go ahead and reach forward into the
[1:16:41] future and say i
[1:16:43] am what he's made me to be i am
[1:16:46] now what i'm going to be this is my
[1:16:49] promise this is my inheritance this is
[1:16:51] my destiny
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:55] you know when brother branham tells a
[1:16:56] story about that that slave
[1:16:58] conducted himself differently than all
[1:17:00] the others
[1:17:02] it was not just the fact of where he
[1:17:05] came from that caused him to act
[1:17:07] differently
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:09] but it was the fact that he was the heir
[1:17:10] to the throne
[1:17:12] so it wasn't just his past that changed
[1:17:15] his conduct
[1:17:16] but it was his future that changed his
[1:17:18] conduct
[1:17:19] he lived as one who believed he still
[1:17:21] had a right to that throne
[1:17:23] he lived as one who believed he was an
[1:17:25] heir to that throne
[1:17:26] he lived his royalty not as one who had
[1:17:28] it taken away from
[1:17:29] but as one that was coming back to it it
[1:17:31] doesn't matter what the devil seems to
[1:17:33] have taken away from you
[1:17:34] what you've lost what you've experienced
[1:17:35] what you've gone through what's been
[1:17:37] destroyed
[1:17:38] you serve a god that is a restorer that
[1:17:40] is a redeemer
[1:17:42] and i will not be defined by my past
[1:17:44] hurts by my past pains
[1:17:45] by my past estrangement by my past
[1:17:48] broken relationships but i will look
[1:17:49] forward to a god
[1:17:50] who is a redeemer who is a restorer who
[1:17:53] is a giver
[1:17:54] who is a granter who is a healer
[1:17:57] to a god who is a creator and i will
[1:18:00] serve him for that
[1:18:01] and i will praise him for that and i'll
[1:18:03] worship him for that and i'll use those
[1:18:05] materials to build who i am
[1:18:09] praise him praise and more hallelujah we
[1:18:11] thank you jesus
[1:18:14] thank you for your presence here with us

[1:18:27] gathered with expectation
[1:18:29] coming earlier traveling even great
[1:18:32] distances

[1:18:38] streets and the holiday rush
[1:18:42] that came lord even
[1:18:46] some changing holiday plans

[1:19:16] now joyous
[1:19:19] but we find joy in the purpose
[1:19:23] of what we're going through

[1:19:28] known the end

[1:19:32] know that this is how it was going to
[1:19:34] turn out we wouldn't have fretted we
[1:19:35] wouldn't have done this we wouldn't have
[1:19:36] done that and we say it
[1:19:37] so often in the natural lord well if i
[1:19:39] knew it was going to work out i wouldn't
[1:19:41] have done this i wouldn't have paid for
[1:19:42] that i wouldn't have done this i
[1:19:43] wouldn't have
[1:19:44] did that lord that we can
[1:19:47] when it comes to our spirits and our

[1:20:08] i know it's coming i'm not wrong to
[1:20:10] praise

[1:20:13] outcome of a game
[1:20:15] and someone's watching a rerun or
[1:20:18] recording
[1:20:19] they can say over and over and over
[1:20:21] again we win we win
[1:20:22] and they're just as confident and happy
[1:20:23] that they win and no change in the score
[1:20:25] what
[1:20:26] causes them to worry
[1:20:29] lord could it be that you've provided
[1:20:31] the ultimate spoiler so your bride
[1:20:33] wouldn't worry
[1:20:35] and you told us the way it will be
[1:20:39] so that we wouldn't be so worried and
[1:20:40] frustrated and upset in the life that
[1:20:42] we're living now and just trust you
[1:20:46] i pray lord that we could accept today
