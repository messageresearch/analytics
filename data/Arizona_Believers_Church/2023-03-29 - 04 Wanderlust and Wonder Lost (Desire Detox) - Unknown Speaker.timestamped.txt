[0:00] as I mentioned we're touching on again
[0:03] the subject of Wonder lust and wonder
[0:05] loss and I'll just revisit this slide on
[0:08] kids eat free I'm using this tonight
[0:10] this uh kind of in a segment of kids eat
[0:14] free because some of the things we're
[0:15] talking about tonight are very directed
[0:17] to parents for the benefit of our
[0:19] children and I think even our children
[0:21] could find that the things that are
[0:23] expressed tonight will be an advantage
[0:25] to them of some principles that they
[0:26] could pick up early on and my title
[0:29] specifically for tonight is desired
[0:31] detox
[0:33] and this will become clear to you as we
[0:35] go forward a desired detox and if we
[0:38] don't have time to finish tonight I feel
[0:40] comfortable just picking back up on
[0:42] Sunday morning and so just trust that
[0:44] you'll help me as we go forward in this
[0:45] if you want to jot that down for an
[0:47] overall theme tonight desire detox
[0:50] and brother John actually once once I
[0:54] get to the next scripture you could just
[0:55] take over from here I think it'll be
[0:57] self-explanatory but if I need to grab
[0:59] the will you're the captain and as a
[1:01] co-captain I'll just take over if I need
[1:03] to on the slides but I'll let you take
[1:05] it from there
[1:06] that I want to revisit uh coming back to
[1:09] life which we spoke on Sunday so as
[1:11] we're looking at Wonder lust and wonder
[1:12] loss uh there might be lost there might
[1:15] be some things that seem a little bit
[1:16] strange to those who haven't heard any
[1:17] of these Services yet but we're looking
[1:19] at finding rediscovering or discovering
[1:21] maybe For the First Time The Wonder of
[1:23] Christ in an age that is possessed with
[1:26] wonderlust and that wonderlust is that
[1:29] aimlessness that just desire uh to be
[1:31] driven by emotions and feelings without
[1:33] any real aim and coming back to life we
[1:36] were looking at how that the hope of
[1:38] real living and if we're really going to
[1:40] be living it's only found in Jesus
[1:41] Christ to have life to have reality to
[1:44] have things that are of substance uh
[1:46] it's only in Christ that we find that so
[1:48] coming back to life involved the theme
[1:50] of Hope and how that's where we find the
[1:52] real living and how that wonderlust it
[1:54] just leads to synthetic experiences it
[1:57] leads to things that have an illusion of
[1:59] fun or have the illusion of enjoyment
[2:01] but actually aren't enjoyment and we're
[2:04] touching on how all the available media
[2:06] that we have and the technology and the
[2:07] entertainment kind of creates that
[2:09] addiction to wonder after desire that's
[2:12] kind of the idea of wonderlust that I
[2:14] have this want I have this desire and
[2:16] I'm wondering after it I'm chasing after
[2:17] I'm trying to scratch a niche I'm trying
[2:19] to be satisfied and one thing that it's
[2:22] important to think about is these things
[2:23] that we enjoy so often whether it be our
[2:26] iPads our cell phones and the apps and
[2:28] social media these things have given us
[2:30] the illusion of control
[2:32] and that we think we're in control we
[2:34] think we're leading things but the
[2:35] illusion of control is the product of
[2:37] cleverly designed systems and they're
[2:39] designed to give you the sense that I
[2:42] can control this at any time I'm the one
[2:43] that determines my destiny I'm the one
[2:45] that's in control of it but actually
[2:47] they're giving you the illusion of
[2:48] control and that illusion of the control
[2:50] is very important for a human they need
[2:52] to know that they're in control and in
[2:54] order to control you they give you the
[2:55] illusion that you're in control
[2:57] you'll find that even some elevator
[2:58] buttons don't ever don't actually work
[3:00] but they're just there so you have the
[3:02] illusion that you're closing the door
[3:03] and the person that's walking down the
[3:04] hallway right and there's a there's a
[3:06] there's a button there telling you that
[3:07] it's going to turn the stop sign to a
[3:09] walk sign and it doesn't work at all
[3:11] it's on a timer but it's given there to
[3:13] satiate your desire to be in control and
[3:16] give you the illusion that you have you
[3:17] have power over something and so when we
[3:19] mentioned that and this theme of coming
[3:21] back to life I'm wanting you to think
[3:23] about
[3:24] influence and Ponder influence and the
[3:26] influence of things and we read this
[3:28] statement at the very I believe it was
[3:30] in the very first service uh to allude
[3:32] to the fact that we as human beings are
[3:35] made to be led by something and we might
[3:37] feel that I have a choice I have to say
[3:38] I have control there's a whole branch of
[3:41] the study of human behavior that says
[3:42] that we actually it's the illusion of
[3:44] choice that you haven't chosen anything
[3:45] your favorite color is the outcome of
[3:48] certain influences in your life where
[3:49] you wanted to go to school you didn't
[3:50] choose it it was already kind of
[3:52] determined by people in your life and
[3:54] things that are happening and so I want
[3:56] to just touch on how we are we are made
[3:58] to be led and brother Brahm says we have
[4:00] to be led he says God likened us unto
[4:02] sheep did you know a sheep can't lead
[4:04] itself
[4:05] so whether we think so or not something
[4:08] is leading us is the point I want to
[4:09] remember remind you of he'll wonder and
[4:12] stray away he just can't lead himself he
[4:15] has to have someone lead him the
[4:16] shepherd is supposed to lead the Sheep
[4:18] now that was back in the days of the
[4:19] Lord Jesus he was the Good Shepherd that
[4:21] led the Sheep but today we're living in
[4:23] another day everything has changed and
[4:25] perverted and he touches on the wrong
[4:27] leader and how the goat is leading sheep
[4:29] to slaughter and how the Sheep need to
[4:31] be led so something that'll lead them
[4:32] they'll just follow it without a leader
[4:34] they just wander off and so there's if I
[4:36] can say this you're you're made to be
[4:38] led but because you're made to be led
[4:39] you're susceptible to the wrong
[4:40] leadership
[4:41] because you want that you want headship
[4:43] you want you want someone to help you
[4:45] and to lead you and be a provider for
[4:47] you so you kind of you'll even give in
[4:49] to forces unknowingly that are leading
[4:51] you but it's the wrong kind of
[4:52] leadership he talks about how the wrong
[4:53] leader leads to death he says but Jesus
[4:55] he led them to life and held their hand
[4:59] and so he's the one that leads us to
[5:01] life it come unto me all ye who are
[5:02] burdened and heavy laden with all the
[5:04] things that encumbers come unto him and
[5:06] he'll give us rest to our souls he says
[5:08] but someone has to lead the Sheep so
[5:10] we're made to be led and so when we
[5:12] think that oh I'm in control of my own
[5:13] destiny and I'm making choices and these
[5:15] things don't control me I can put it up
[5:17] whenever I want to it's good to think
[5:20] about well what is leading you
[5:22] because we're made to be led now in
[5:24] James chapter 1 verses 14 and 15. again
[5:27] we're just reviewing some of these
[5:29] things on coming back to life it says
[5:30] but every man is tempted his character
[5:33] is tested when he is drawn away of his
[5:36] own lust his own wants and desires and
[5:38] enticed then when lust hath conceived to
[5:41] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[5:43] finished bringeth forth death so there's
[5:45] the outcome of the process that we are
[5:48] our character is going to be tested when
[5:50] of our own desires we're drawn away by
[5:52] your own want you're drawn away and
[5:55] enticed and you're kind of caught and
[5:56] trapped and so that was an important
[5:58] distinction I believe for us to look at
[6:00] how that it's our own lust our own
[6:02] desires that draw us away from Christ
[6:04] and that it's in our own want being
[6:07] excited something influences you to want
[6:09] something and when you allow that to
[6:11] draw you away that's when you do and do
[6:13] and say things that lead to death
[6:16] that lead to not living if I could put
[6:18] it that way it was how we were looking
[6:19] at it and we cannot find real living in
[6:23] just trying to satisfy the desires of
[6:25] our flesh and that that want that's
[6:28] coming back to that want every man is
[6:29] tempted when he's drawn away of his own
[6:31] want his own desires and
[6:33] they I guess this kind of pulls me into
[6:36] the greater thought on Sunday how the
[6:38] things that kind of drive us and the
[6:40] things that we want to do doesn't
[6:42] necessarily mean we like to do them
[6:43] there's just a part of us that wants to
[6:45] do it so desire and want is different
[6:48] from love and light
[6:49] it's different from Love and Happiness
[6:51] and enjoyment so we can be driven a
[6:53] compulsion to do things that we actually
[6:55] don't even love driven to do things that
[6:57] actually don't even bring us happiness
[6:59] and so there's a desire want versus love
[7:01] and in some ways I thought of this that
[7:03] some of us are trying to love the things
[7:05] we want
[7:07] that's what we're trying to do we're
[7:08] trying to love the things we want
[7:10] because we're trying to find a deeper
[7:12] connection with these things that we
[7:13] feel a compulsion for we're trying to
[7:15] find deeper meaning in these things we
[7:17] want to do but you're not going to find
[7:18] love there
[7:19] and so it's that that wrestling and that
[7:21] desire of wants and lust and and things
[7:24] that you want to have that aren't
[7:25] necessarily the same as what you like
[7:27] and what you enjoy
[7:29] and in second Corinthians chapter 2
[7:30] verse 11 it says lest Satan should get
[7:32] an advantage of us for we and I we are
[7:35] not ignorant of his devices
[7:37] now that is
[7:39] you know he's using it in
[7:42] in the context but I believe the larger
[7:44] narrative to the Corinthians but he's
[7:46] saying that we do not let Satan Swindle
[7:49] us or defraud us or deceive us because
[7:51] we're aware of his tricks
[7:53] so he's saying he's teaching them to do
[7:55] something he says because if we don't
[7:56] since we're aware of his devices we're
[7:58] aware of how he tries to take advantage
[8:00] of us and since we're knowledgeable of
[8:02] us we don't let him defraud us so it's
[8:04] important for us even in this context of
[8:07] not letting Satan get advantage of us
[8:08] that we're aware of the devices they're
[8:11] stimulating our flesh uh and those
[8:13] desires to be entertained to be satiated
[8:15] to be satisfied and these are just some
[8:18] things about coming back to life these
[8:19] things we're feeding on our promoting
[8:21] death and Corruption and depression and
[8:23] anxiety and we'll we'll expound upon
[8:26] that more this evening but it's
[8:28] recognizing how there's things that are
[8:29] going to be offered to us that kind of
[8:32] excite our flesh and the flesh tends to
[8:34] addiction the flesh likes some
[8:36] repetitive behavior and doing things
[8:38] over and over again and we need we're
[8:39] just wanting to recognize those
[8:40] different things
[8:42] so uh I think this is I just want to
[8:45] continue on this coming back to life a
[8:47] little bit but take we're taking another
[8:49] step in this those all that was kind of
[8:51] just review so I trust that we're all on
[8:53] the same page now
[8:54] we use the phrase coming back to life to
[8:57] speak about sobering up
[8:59] and and kind of not being influenced by
[9:01] the things of this world sober from the
[9:03] intoxication of technology and media and
[9:06] I know that we've all experienced this
[9:08] on some level if you're if you don't
[9:10] that's not quite come into your mind uh
[9:13] just ask yourself the next time you
[9:14] watch something or hear something or see
[9:16] something how it makes you feel and
[9:18] you'll find that when you watch the
[9:19] movie about mountain climbers you wanted
[9:20] to go climb a mountain when you watched
[9:22] a movie about a road trip you wanted to
[9:23] go on a road trip you find you're being
[9:25] influenced by these things and so
[9:27] there's a an intoxication that's coming
[9:29] from all the media conception all the
[9:31] technology we engage in and the coming
[9:33] back to life is about renewing hope
[9:35] and about finding Wonder In Christ and
[9:38] not just in devices and Technology but
[9:40] finding this Wonder In The Wonder of
[9:42] Christ and I hope that you can recall
[9:44] all the scriptures that told us ahead of
[9:46] time what human nature is like and the
[9:48] eye never being satisfied with seeing
[9:50] the ear never being full of hearing and
[9:52] how the word has warned us ahead of time
[9:54] of the things that are to come and it's
[9:56] told us ahead of time of how that human
[9:58] nature works and it always gives us the
[10:00] answer
[10:01] doesn't say hey man your belly's never
[10:03] going to be full your eyes always going
[10:04] to see your ear is always going to hear
[10:06] and you just have to kind of lean into
[10:08] this uh addiction and just suffer
[10:11] through it but it kind of gives us the
[10:12] answer and the answer is Christ
[10:14] and it gives us the answer and so now
[10:17] I'm going to use some details here at
[10:18] the beginning hopefully this kind of
[10:19] just wakes us up and gets our attention
[10:21] because it's coming back to life is
[10:23] touching on how things are robbing us of
[10:26] real living they did a study in 2019 of
[10:29] high school students uh who are the high
[10:32] school students here raise your hand if
[10:33] you're in high school raise them high
[10:34] okay well we just got a few a few high
[10:36] school students those of you who are
[10:38] coming to it this will be good for you
[10:39] to think about they did a study on high
[10:42] school students found a third of all
[10:43] high school students reported persistent
[10:45] feelings of sadness and hopelessness
[10:48] one-third 33 percent of high school
[10:50] students said they felt persistently uh
[10:53] feelings of sadness and hopelessness and
[10:55] I was like wow they feel like adults do
[10:57] but this is something that they're
[10:59] recognizing
[11:01] they're just coming to adulthood a lot
[11:02] quicker these days I guess
[11:04] but they had these feelings of sadness
[11:05] and hopelessness and it was up 40
[11:07] percent from where it would been a
[11:09] decade before or so and so they're
[11:11] noticing this increase of hopelessness
[11:13] this increase of this persistent sadness
[11:15] and that was the third of all high
[11:17] school students and even more alarming
[11:18] 50 of all the girls said they felt it so
[11:21] I had one out of two whatever every girl
[11:23] is fills this persistent sadness feels a
[11:26] persistent hopelessness
[11:28] and at the same time in 2019 the
[11:31] American Medical Association found that
[11:32] the amount of screen time uh time spent
[11:35] on screens or social media and on these
[11:37] devices increa can increase depression
[11:40] can increase anxiety
[11:43] and so if they're just looking at a
[11:44] correlation they'll readily admit that
[11:46] but they're pondering the causation and
[11:48] how that as we've seen the increase of
[11:50] screen time the increase of social media
[11:52] interaction as the increase of all these
[11:54] things from the world they're noticing
[11:55] an increase in hopelessness an increase
[11:58] in sadness amongst young people and any
[12:01] study that you read in any any
[12:02] literature that you'll find on this
[12:04] academic study or journalism will tell
[12:06] you that technology has improved their
[12:08] lives in many ways and that technology
[12:10] performs many useful tasks but all
[12:13] technology has a downside and carries
[12:15] with it some adverse effects
[12:17] and two areas they're finding where
[12:19] these adverse effects are so prominent
[12:21] is how that we come to become dependent
[12:23] upon them we have this increased
[12:26] dependence on technology and media and
[12:28] then also there's this the phrase that
[12:30] uses upward social comparison
[12:33] so there's two ways that we're that life
[12:35] is becoming less real to us and it's
[12:37] we're becoming more dependent upon
[12:38] technology and the more that we're
[12:40] interacting on technology the more that
[12:42] we compare ourselves to other people and
[12:44] it's upward comparison because we think
[12:46] they're better than us
[12:49] this increased dependence arises from I
[12:52] was going to do a whole sermon on the
[12:53] algorithm and I thought well that might
[12:55] just be a little bit too scary
[12:57] uh to really dive into what the
[12:59] algorithm is but we have this increased
[13:01] dependence upon technology and it's the
[13:03] it comes from this the manipulative
[13:05] algorithm that's used on all the
[13:07] platforms that we engage in and The
[13:10] Addictive design of them they're all
[13:12] designed to be addictive
[13:13] I mean I may be enlightening some people
[13:15] to this and I'll say this to parents who
[13:18] just hand their kids devices and you
[13:19] don't know this you better listen
[13:21] closely because by Design the the the
[13:24] graphic interface that they're using is
[13:27] made the GUI is made to cause them to
[13:30] become addicted to it and and the
[13:33] interactions on it there's a
[13:34] manipulative algorithm that kind of
[13:35] keeps any information and communication
[13:37] technology kind of has it baked into it
[13:39] now keep them on it as long as you can
[13:41] use an algorithm to make them depend
[13:43] upon it and I found this phrase in one
[13:46] study in order to make money these
[13:47] platforms algorithms effectively
[13:49] function to keep users engaged in
[13:51] scrolling through content
[13:53] it's made that way to keep you engaged
[13:55] to keep you online to keep you using it
[13:57] and then they intermittently reward you
[13:59] with some stimulus
[14:00] a like a follow a notification points
[14:03] right a crate a chest you know something
[14:06] new a new skin they have different ways
[14:08] of giving you something and as they
[14:11] intermittently reward you with stimulus
[14:12] it causes you to keep being engaged with
[14:15] whatever it is you're doing
[14:16] it's designed that way it's designed to
[14:18] keep you coming back and they call it a
[14:21] pleasure Rush that you get this pleasure
[14:22] Rush even from a notification and and I
[14:25] imagine some of you tonight you're gonna
[14:26] check your smart watch something's going
[14:27] to vibrate something's going to Ding and
[14:29] it's going to cause this little ooh
[14:31] I wonder what it is
[14:33] right it's your car warranties expired
[14:37] or or your Amazon account has been
[14:40] locked right
[14:41] and a Nigerian prince has the new
[14:43] password
[14:45] and so there's this pleasure Rush
[14:46] whenever you get a notification there's
[14:48] this ooh I wonder what it can be and
[14:49] even this sense of this Wonder of when I
[14:52] open it up who's going to be texting me
[14:54] who's going to be liking me how many
[14:55] people have looked at my WhatsApp status
[14:57] today uh what are the comments what's
[14:59] the feedback this it's they're called a
[15:01] pleasure rush and this pleasure rush act
[15:03] activates the same processes in your
[15:06] brain they call them dopamine pathways
[15:08] the same the same processes that relate
[15:11] to our motivation that have to do with
[15:13] our our rewards and addictions all those
[15:15] things so these things are all related
[15:17] together in our thinking
[15:19] and as these areas that are of concern
[15:21] that are causing this increase in
[15:23] depression and anxiety among people uh
[15:25] these social comparisons are one thing
[15:28] that happens a lot when you're engaged
[15:29] in social media and every even if it's a
[15:31] game or an app there's always something
[15:32] you're comparing yourself to you're part
[15:34] of a clan you're part of a group you're
[15:36] part of some community and there's
[15:37] certain rankings and there's certain
[15:39] feedback and everything's social they do
[15:40] it for a reason to get you to engage
[15:42] they find that social rewards light up
[15:44] our reward system much more than
[15:46] non-social Rewards
[15:48] something that inspires us a lot more
[15:49] these social things
[15:51] and and they they
[15:53] with these social comparisons we're
[15:55] wired to compare we just can't help it
[15:57] we're always we're always going to be
[15:58] making comparison and what happens
[16:00] through our interactions on social media
[16:02] we're always comparing ourselves to
[16:04] somebody else and we have a tendency to
[16:05] think that what they're experiencing is
[16:07] better than what we're experiencing
[16:09] because we're kind of in the reality we
[16:11] know we know that this beautiful picture
[16:13] we just posted on Instagram of the cake
[16:15] we just made it doesn't taste good and
[16:16] it was a nightmare and it fell apart as
[16:18] soon as you took the picture but
[16:19] everybody else is like wow that cake
[16:21] looks great and you're looking at
[16:22] somebody else's cake and he's saying I
[16:23] imagine it tastes better than mine and
[16:25] they did it very easily and they're so
[16:27] good and we compare ourselves and it's
[16:29] kind of this upward social comparison
[16:30] and we feel inferior
[16:34] and we're worried about impa
[16:36] imperfections in our lives that if you
[16:37] really examine it by the light of God's
[16:39] word they don't even exist
[16:41] but in the light of the world and all
[16:42] the filters and the things the world
[16:43] wants to present we're beating ourselves
[16:45] up through all these things that we
[16:47] experience and you wonder no wonder
[16:48] there's so much anxiety no wonder
[16:49] there's so much depression
[16:51] they say that teens who grow up checking
[16:53] social media more often are becoming
[16:55] hypersensitive to feedback from their
[16:57] peers
[16:58] there there's this heightened
[16:59] sensitivity to social rewards feedback
[17:01] how am I being accepted am I being
[17:03] followed
[17:04] and and the the three areas of the brain
[17:07] that are most impacted by this is the
[17:08] reward processing part and the regions
[17:11] of the brand that determine what you
[17:13] think is important to salience like
[17:14] recognizing an environment what's
[17:16] important what's a danger uh what what
[17:18] stands out in an environment what do I
[17:20] need to be paying attention to our
[17:21] brains are being conditioned even that
[17:23] prefrontal cortex which has to do with
[17:25] controlling our Behavior it's all
[17:27] impacted by the time we spend in apps
[17:29] and games and social media and on this
[17:31] technology it's being proven how much it
[17:34] affect impacts the brain
[17:36] and this is a statement that when I went
[17:38] back and found the article that I had
[17:39] that I'd found this in there was just a
[17:41] phrase in that I really really like and
[17:43] wow it stunned me when they were talking
[17:44] about this old antique I think it was
[17:46] called Hamlet's BlackBerry
[17:49] if anybody knows what it is it's not a
[17:51] shake you can get it nectar it was a
[17:53] phone it was a device
[17:55] and this is what the author wrote Our
[17:57] tools are fertile they're constantly
[17:59] multiplying and this is true here
[18:00] several you know over a decade later the
[18:03] more connected we are the more we depend
[18:05] on the outside world the world outside
[18:08] of ourselves to tell us how to think and
[18:10] live
[18:12] right you cannot buy something on Amazon
[18:14] until you look at the reviews right and
[18:17] find out what all the what those Bots
[18:19] think about this product they've never
[18:21] used before
[18:23] and so we become more dependent upon the
[18:25] outside world it amazes me how often we
[18:28] regurgitate tweets
[18:30] oh can you believe it what happened and
[18:32] they said this that and the other like
[18:33] okay like who's the expert that said
[18:36] that like Nancy in Tennessee
[18:38] like oh oh Nancy yeah the little Bastion
[18:42] of Truth and discernment
[18:44] and we we regurgitate it and spit it out
[18:48] as if this person has the right take on
[18:50] what's Happening what does it mean we're
[18:52] more in tune with what the and even the
[18:54] new newscast now have the Twitter scroll
[18:58] right and you've tuned out the expert
[19:00] right you've turned out the tuned out
[19:02] the one who wrote the paper copy that
[19:04] has the facts right and you're wanting
[19:05] to know what Bubba Love has to say about
[19:07] it
[19:08] right
[19:09] because that's what we've been
[19:11] conditioned to think and to do in the
[19:12] age that we're living it says we depend
[19:14] upon what the outside world thinks and
[19:17] says we hear the voices of others and we
[19:20] are directed by those voices
[19:24] these voices are directing us and I'm
[19:26] telling you this is what's causing that
[19:27] wonderlust
[19:28] this wondering this aimless pointless
[19:30] behavior that is devalued Christ in our
[19:33] eyes when he's the true Wonder
[19:35] they say that an average person spends
[19:37] 145 minutes on social media per day
[19:40] the average person and some of you are
[19:42] thinking I ain't average
[19:44] I'm a lot more than that
[19:46] right the average person sends 145
[19:49] minutes on social media per day I'd like
[19:51] to think some of us are bringing that
[19:53] number down right
[19:55] by our failing to interact on these
[19:57] things
[19:58] and the more the time that you spin on
[20:00] it takes a toll and wanting to recognize
[20:02] it takes a toll on her mental health
[20:03] takes a toll in our brain and the way
[20:05] our brain processes things it's shaping
[20:07] our desires it's shaping our wants and
[20:09] I'm using this all to point out the fact
[20:11] that there's things that you're wanting
[20:13] that aren't necessarily the things that
[20:14] you like or the things that you need or
[20:16] the things that you love or the things
[20:17] that bring you happiness but you have a
[20:19] compulsion to want them and we're trying
[20:21] to find out why have I lost my
[20:23] sensitivity to the spirit why am I not
[20:25] hungering for the things of God more why
[20:27] don't I find that church excites me why
[20:29] do I find that Christ isn't like all the
[20:31] words I sing of him the Wonder the all I
[20:33] need and all that I want it's not
[20:35] because he isn't all you need and all
[20:37] that you desire and all that you love
[20:38] it's all the other things that are
[20:40] dumbing it down
[20:43] and these things that we engage in it's
[20:45] impacting our quality of life
[20:47] and it's causing an increase in
[20:49] loneliness anxiety fear of missing out
[20:51] social comparison and depression
[20:54] these are all the things that it's
[20:56] giving rise to
[20:58] there's these things are so numerous in
[21:01] terms of what it's impacting
[21:03] so now
[21:06] let's look at desire detox
[21:09] now what I mean by this when I say
[21:11] desire detox is detoxifying our bodies
[21:15] from addictive and unhealthy toxins
[21:17] that's what a detox is we'll come back
[21:19] to maybe here in a moment
[21:20] but we're detoxing our minds our hearts
[21:22] our Spirits things that we find
[21:24] ourselves we have a compulsion to do
[21:26] what we want to do is detoxify our
[21:29] Spirits from these addictive and
[21:31] unhealthy toxins
[21:34] I call it a desire detox we're looking
[21:37] at Satan's devices worldly devices
[21:39] things that are intended to deceive or
[21:40] to trick us gimmicks that kind of hook
[21:43] us and entice us and as we read in
[21:45] Jeremiah the heart is deceitful above
[21:47] all things and desperately wicked who
[21:49] can know it this the addictions are
[21:51] deceptive
[21:53] the heart is deceitful Above All Things
[21:55] there's this false sense of fulfillment
[21:57] I want it
[21:58] but it's not bringing me fulfillment but
[22:00] I still want it
[22:01] it's those empty calories right and you
[22:04] can't you just keep eating it and you
[22:06] never feel full and you'll you can find
[22:08] yourself just keep eating that's the way
[22:09] the world is there's no satisfying
[22:11] substance in it and so I almost called
[22:13] it a deception detoxification but I
[22:15] realized this is pointing to desire we
[22:18] want we want we want and we want to
[22:20] consume it and we want to have it but
[22:22] it's never satisfying us so we need a
[22:24] desire detox
[22:26] a detoxification is a the action of
[22:28] depriving uh one of the deprivation of
[22:32] poisonous qualities
[22:34] a detoxification is the removal of
[22:36] addictive substances
[22:38] so if you're on a detox it's the process
[22:39] or period of time whether it be a
[22:41] process or just a period of time when
[22:42] one abstains from or rids the body of
[22:45] toxic things
[22:47] they do this when one is trying to
[22:48] recover from an addictive substance they
[22:50] they for a space of time they remove
[22:52] them from ingesting it on any level so
[22:55] that all traces of an addictive
[22:56] substance are removed from them so they
[22:58] can overcome their dependence on it
[23:01] this is what we would do this is what
[23:03] would be done and certain clinical
[23:04] settings when someone has a chemical
[23:06] addiction they they bring them into a
[23:08] place to where they can't ingest it in
[23:10] any way and let it get out of the system
[23:12] and they'll experience withdrawals and
[23:15] they'll experience a lot of painful
[23:16] things as a result of it but they're
[23:18] wanting to get the body to a place where
[23:20] it's no longer depending on it and it
[23:21] takes the detox to do that
[23:24] it's finding anything that's a toxin
[23:25] anything that's a poison anything that
[23:28] someone is addicted to or has a
[23:29] compulsion to and they remove it so they
[23:31] can overcome their dependence on it
[23:34] now let's look at the scripture in
[23:36] Psalms 139 together
[23:38] because this is
[23:40] this is where
[23:42] I want to make this relevant to us
[23:43] because it says search mail God
[23:46] you say oh detoxification that's for
[23:48] people addicted to pain pills that's for
[23:49] people who use drugs
[23:51] not so fast
[23:53] search me o God and know my heart try me
[23:56] and know my thoughts
[23:58] and see if there be any wicked way in me
[24:02] and Lead Me in the way Everlasting lead
[24:05] me into life lead me into abundance
[24:08] and so see if there be any wicked way in
[24:10] me now I know some of you are thinking
[24:12] Lord do I really want to rob a bank do I
[24:14] want to murder my neighbor and you're
[24:16] thinking in terms of Wicked Ways you
[24:17] kind of think on that level but here
[24:19] this Hebrew word Wicked just means a
[24:20] pain or a sorrow
[24:23] or Idol
[24:25] it speaks of a hardship and this what's
[24:28] at the root of it see if there be any
[24:29] wicked way in me way means manner of
[24:33] habit course or Direction manner of life
[24:35] or habit see if there'd be any manner of
[24:37] life or habit course or direction of my
[24:39] life see if there'd be any wicked way it
[24:41] means an object of pain or an object of
[24:44] offense
[24:45] see if there be any Habit in my life
[24:47] that causes me suffering see if there'd
[24:48] be any Habit in my life that causes me
[24:50] pain or hardship and this is an honesty
[24:52] don't just examine me to see if there's
[24:54] some sort of filthy vile thing it's even
[24:56] Lord see if there's some way in my life
[24:58] manner or habit or cause course of
[25:00] action in my life that is a burden to me
[25:02] and I don't know it because it's saying
[25:04] examine me
[25:05] it's not even offering up Lord deliver
[25:07] me from this habit of chewing my
[25:09] fingernails Lord deliver me from this
[25:11] habit of ingesting this no he says Lord
[25:13] search my heart because I know my heart
[25:15] is desperately wicked and there might be
[25:17] a useless way in me there might be an
[25:20] offensive way in me there might be some
[25:22] Habit in my life that I don't even
[25:23] realize is bringing me down the path of
[25:25] pain and I want you to deliver me from
[25:27] it so I can walk in the way Everlasting
[25:31] and I want and I could be very very
[25:33] specific tonight very very precise
[25:36] but I'm talking about a desired detox
[25:38] it's any want any desire that is toxic
[25:41] to us
[25:43] so we're using this scripture as kind of
[25:45] our main point tonight see if there be
[25:48] any way in me
[25:50] Lord examine my heart try me you know my
[25:52] heart you know my ways you know my
[25:55] thoughts see if there be any
[25:57] object of hardship
[25:59] or some offense in my in my manner or
[26:01] habit
[26:03] the Bible says in First Corinthians
[26:05] chapter 7 verse 31
[26:07] these are these General
[26:08] Commandments that Paul is given he says
[26:10] and they that use this world is not
[26:12] abusing it
[26:14] for the fashion of this world passeth
[26:16] away
[26:17] let's talk about when it says not
[26:19] abusing it it's the overuse of it
[26:22] that's what the phrase means not abusing
[26:23] it the overuse or the excess of
[26:25] something so there's certain things that
[26:27] we may use but when it says it's not
[26:29] abusing it don't take your happiness
[26:31] from it
[26:32] Don't Take Your satisfaction from it
[26:34] don't take your fulfillment the full use
[26:36] of it that this to me is what is going
[26:38] to satisfy me because he says for the
[26:39] fashion of this world passeth away the
[26:41] way things are will change
[26:43] and anything you become dependent on
[26:45] anything that to you means something and
[26:47] it matters it's it's all transitory It's
[26:49] All Temporary what a warning to us that
[26:52] put stake our whole identity into
[26:53] something and said this is my living
[26:54] this is my life this is my reputation
[26:56] and they can shut the platform down
[26:58] overnight
[26:59] they could change the rules to the game
[27:01] these things could disappear it says
[27:03] these things are so change all the time
[27:04] so it says don't if you use the world
[27:07] don't get your happiness out of it don't
[27:08] get your identity out of it don't get
[27:10] you're full of it because it's just
[27:12] going to set you up for disappointment
[27:13] because it always changes
[27:16] you're finally able to afford those
[27:17] Yeezys and he comes out as a complete
[27:20] wacko right
[27:23] you think man I finally got a pair of
[27:24] Yeezys and now you find out the guy's
[27:26] certifiably insane
[27:28] why because the world just changes
[27:31] no offense Kanye just pay your ties
[27:35] you might remember that we touched us
[27:37] touched on this in the year in preview I
[27:38] think it was part four we touched on
[27:40] these things and we talked about how
[27:41] this Bible is saying that we that use
[27:42] this world are not abusing it and it's
[27:45] specifically talk about how things are
[27:46] designed to constantly get us to
[27:48] stimulate the pleasure center of our
[27:49] minds
[27:50] and that these games uh triggered these
[27:53] addictive responses these incentives
[27:54] lead to soft addictions we touched on
[27:56] all that the apps the games the movies
[27:58] the shows all these things the the
[28:00] narratives behind all these things
[28:03] it's all made to get us to abuse or
[28:06] overuse
[28:07] so they that use this world I want to
[28:10] say they that use any kind of Technology
[28:11] they that use any kind of entertainment
[28:13] they they those that gay engage in any
[28:15] kind of recreation let's not abuse it
[28:19] and it specifically means let's not
[28:21] overuse it
[28:23] so using but not abusing it's the
[28:24] overuse or excess of information and
[28:27] communication technology the overuse and
[28:29] excess of media the overuse and excess
[28:31] of entertainment and music and sports
[28:33] and all these things because the Bible's
[28:36] tell us it's those things that inflame
[28:38] desire
[28:40] so those things that that cause this
[28:42] greater passion and again this goes on
[28:45] any level I believe I just feel that we
[28:47] could just say it uh uh just without any
[28:51] reluctance or hesitation at all
[28:53] there's the eye and the ear they always
[28:55] want more you have a favorite team and
[28:57] you want them to win and when they win
[28:59] the championship you don't archive your
[29:01] jersey right
[29:03] yeah you don't say hey they made it they
[29:04] climbed to the top of the mountain they
[29:05] planted the flag it's over it's done
[29:07] let's move on to something else no
[29:09] you're thirsty for another one right you
[29:12] want to get all the commemorative
[29:13] memorabilia and you're already starting
[29:15] to watch out and see whether or not they
[29:16] can defend their title and you're trying
[29:18] to trademark three Pete and things like
[29:19] that why because you cannot be satisfied
[29:22] with what the world offers you by Design
[29:25] they never want you to stop being hungry
[29:28] so it inflames desire
[29:31] and overusing is a scripture word and
[29:33] they that use this world is not
[29:35] overusing it and overusing is a medical
[29:37] term
[29:39] overusing has been termed dependent
[29:41] syndrome
[29:43] to Define addiction and habituation the
[29:45] World Health Organization uses dependent
[29:47] syndrome to signify overuse
[29:50] we say overuse that means a habit
[29:53] an addiction
[29:55] and this overuse refers to a strong
[29:57] desire some sense of compulsion to where
[30:00] you can't you're not in control of your
[30:01] behavior anymore
[30:03] maybe it's a little bit controversial
[30:05] but they're finding that behavioral
[30:06] addictions are is a syndrome that's
[30:08] analogous to a substance abuse substance
[30:11] syndrome addiction
[30:12] but it's about your behavior and it's
[30:14] maybe an emerging field of study but
[30:15] they can diagnose you with the substance
[30:17] addiction but now they're realizing
[30:18] there's behavioral addictions
[30:21] and when the Bible and many of these
[30:23] behaviors we have can provide us with
[30:24] short-term rewards and because they
[30:27] provide us with that short-term reward
[30:28] it engenders persistent Behavior
[30:31] because there's a reward for it when you
[30:32] check when there's a reward for it when
[30:34] you play when there's a reward for it
[30:35] when you're interacting it causes to be
[30:38] more persistent in doing it
[30:40] and so the Bible's using this term and
[30:42] science is picking up on it this
[30:43] overusing points to a compulsion to an
[30:46] activity and this compulsion to an
[30:48] activity is maybe one that we're not
[30:50] even in control of anymore
[30:52] we think we are but we're not
[30:55] and just for the this is just the
[30:58] statistic I had here at this point
[31:01] they say the average adult checks their
[31:03] phone 110 times a day
[31:05] and I know what we're all thinking
[31:07] amateurs
[31:09] right
[31:10] they were like only 110 you need to get
[31:13] those numbers up you need a smart watch
[31:15] right
[31:16] you need to you need to put that that
[31:19] app on your home screen so you can check
[31:21] your numbers
[31:23] 110 times a day they do it that means
[31:25] once every 13 minutes
[31:27] they checked their phone and your phone
[31:29] will tell you now how many pickups you
[31:30] have what your screen time is and so
[31:33] adults are checking their phone 110
[31:34] times a day once every 13 minutes but
[31:36] for most people it increases to every
[31:39] six seconds in the evening
[31:42] how many of you have checked your watch
[31:44] already tonight not to tell the time
[31:46] right
[31:47] how easy is it just to look just to
[31:49] check it's because there's this
[31:50] compulsion
[31:52] and the screen use is this exponentially
[31:56] more addictive and detrimental for
[31:58] children
[31:59] exponentially more addictive and
[32:01] detrimental to youth as a matter of fact
[32:03] the American Academy Academy of
[32:05] Pediatrics says zero screen time for
[32:07] children under two years old
[32:09] zero
[32:14] and strict controls for anyone older
[32:17] than that
[32:18] and think about how much unfettered
[32:20] access we give to PlayStation to Xbox to
[32:24] we to switch remember the sermon on
[32:27] restoring the switch in the home
[32:29] like that I alluded to I didn't actually
[32:31] preach it
[32:33] but they're the less the American
[32:34] Academy of Pediatrics get after me
[32:37] but they there is a
[32:40] this think about all the access they
[32:42] have to screens and the doctors that
[32:44] take care of your kids are saying if
[32:46] they're under two they shouldn't have it
[32:47] at all if they're older than until you
[32:48] better have strict controls on it
[32:51] and so there's it's becoming a pandemic
[32:56] it's becoming a pandemic not even
[32:57] epidemic this is not this is not just a
[32:59] first world problem anymore it's
[33:01] spreading it's spread all over the world
[33:03] where now there's this issue with young
[33:04] people and children finding themselves
[33:06] their minds are being shaped and their
[33:08] brains are being changed all by the way
[33:10] that they use these things the reward
[33:12] processing their their salience uh their
[33:15] their risk control all these things are
[33:16] being influenced by the screens that
[33:18] they're on and they're thinking how can
[33:20] we control our kids on screens
[33:23] how is it that we can help our children
[33:25] direct statement parents should reduce
[33:27] their own screen time
[33:29] they figure the best path to help our
[33:32] kids is to demonstrate to them by
[33:33] example
[33:35] and that if we're ever going to get our
[33:36] kids to reduce their own screen time
[33:38] we've got to reduce it ourselves
[33:41] the Bible says in Philippians chapter 4
[33:43] verse 5
[33:47] let your moderation be known
[33:49] unto all men
[33:52] the Lord is at hand
[33:54] why does it say the Lord is at hand the
[33:56] rewarder
[33:57] that's what he's referred to the judge
[33:59] the rewarder is at hand
[34:00] so you need to let your moderation be
[34:02] known unto all men because God is doing
[34:03] what rewarding you for your behavior
[34:06] not to determine salvation right this is
[34:09] rewards he says the the Lord is at hand
[34:11] he's going to judge your moderation
[34:12] moderation is translated to being gentle
[34:15] and patient the scripture patience is
[34:16] used gentle is used let your gentleness
[34:19] let your patience let your moderation be
[34:21] known unto all men moderation speaks of
[34:23] something that is suitable or fair or
[34:25] mild the the Greek root there is to
[34:27] yield your yieldiness
[34:29] and the thought that's being expressed
[34:31] in Philippians let your modesty be made
[34:32] known
[34:33] let your humility be made known
[34:36] and what it's referring to is that to
[34:38] all men let the sweetness of temper be
[34:40] made known
[34:41] in your whole Behavior this temperance
[34:45] it went to speak of being gentle and you
[34:47] look at the other scriptures your
[34:48] meekness under provocation
[34:50] and she said well brother Aaron it seems
[34:52] to me that it's telling me that if a
[34:54] fellow human being provokes me or
[34:56] somebody else tries to make me mad I can
[34:58] be harsh I can be judgmental I need to
[34:59] be patient I need to be I need to be
[35:02] gentle and that's part of it but
[35:03] moderation is being referred to is
[35:05] moderation and all behavior is the
[35:08] government of our passions
[35:10] it's a government of Desire
[35:13] and it's meekness under provocation let
[35:15] your moderation be known under the
[35:17] algorithm
[35:18] let your moderation be known unto all
[35:20] men and all things that are trying to
[35:21] provoke you provoke your passions
[35:23] influences you say well I think he's
[35:25] speaking about getting angry it's
[35:26] speaking about any desire curbing any
[35:28] desire
[35:29] let your moderation we use that to speak
[35:31] of something like not into excess and
[35:33] being too much but it does speak to this
[35:35] controlling our desires and controlling
[35:37] our passions
[35:39] Psalms 101 verse 3 says I will set no
[35:42] Wicked thing before mine eyes
[35:45] the wicked there again is not the things
[35:47] that we might normally tend to is of
[35:50] something perverted or naked or
[35:52] something nasty but it just means
[35:54] useless
[35:56] unprofitable
[35:59] he says I hate the work of them that
[36:01] turn aside
[36:03] from The Wonder of Christ the phrase
[36:05] turn aside is the ones that would turn
[36:06] from the truth turn from the law it says
[36:08] it shall not cleave to me
[36:11] which means to stay close by
[36:14] I think the writers propose in a detox
[36:17] I will set no useless unprofitable thing
[36:20] before mine eyes that doesn't
[36:22] necessarily mean the device itself or it
[36:26] within your vision but to set something
[36:28] before your eyes means I said it forth
[36:30] as an example to follow or something I
[36:32] approve of
[36:34] that I give it enough attention and I
[36:36] give it enough treatment and I give it
[36:38] enough place in my life to where it's
[36:40] not just something I use but now it's
[36:41] becoming something I abuse and I will
[36:43] set no useless unprofitable thing before
[36:46] me such that it is an example that I
[36:48] follow or something that I approve of he
[36:50] says I will not let it cleave to me in
[36:52] other words I am not going to let this
[36:53] inflame my heart
[36:55] it's not going to be something that I'm
[36:57] attached to something I'm tied to
[36:58] something that becomes my example
[37:00] something that I look for for approval
[37:03] and the wicked thing here extends to
[37:05] those things that are useless and
[37:06] unprofitable yet addicting
[37:09] and think about the example we set for
[37:11] our children
[37:12] in the things that we handle and touch
[37:15] and enjoy and listen to the most and
[37:18] what it signals to our children
[37:22] and now that they themselves are
[37:24] watching the useless unprofitable things
[37:26] that you've set before you and it
[37:28] becomes an example to them
[37:32] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 18 says and be
[37:34] not drunk with wine wherein is excess
[37:37] and then the contrast but be filled with
[37:38] the spirit be influenced by let it have
[37:41] premise let the spirit have preeminence
[37:44] be not drunk with wine where in his
[37:46] excess it means wasteful of prodigal
[37:48] do not be overly influenced by fleshly
[37:51] intoxicants
[37:53] I would say it it's precisely speaking
[37:55] of wine but it's pointing to anything
[37:57] that would inordinately intoxicate you
[38:01] as Paul says in First Corinthians 6 12 I
[38:03] would not be brought into the power of
[38:04] any
[38:05] anything can have a power to intoxicate
[38:07] us
[38:07] anything can become some compulsion and
[38:11] it's amazing the things that people find
[38:12] themselves compulsion to do and you
[38:15] think oh that's weird that's bizarre
[38:17] it's the human nature that they can be
[38:19] brought into the power of anything
[38:21] there's a power to yield to something to
[38:23] give in to I want you to think about
[38:25] this and Lord search my heart and find
[38:27] if there be any wicked way in me any
[38:31] habit any anything that I do in a
[38:33] regular course where there is not
[38:34] moderation where I am setting something
[38:37] useless before me that I seek my own
[38:39] approval in it or that I approve of that
[38:41] has become an example you know I've
[38:42] allowed anything to have power over me
[38:45] Lord anything wherein there is access
[38:48] Jesus says in Luke 21 verse 34 and take
[38:51] heed to yourselves
[38:52] lest at any time your hearts be
[38:54] overcharged
[38:57] with sir fitting and drunkenness
[39:01] and cares of this life
[39:02] is it just coincidence that surfing the
[39:04] web like searching surfing in here it's
[39:07] a way we could just kind of force that
[39:09] in there
[39:10] overcharge that's all we're worried
[39:12] about is how big how much our batteries
[39:13] are charged he says your heart's be
[39:15] overcharged with surfeiting and
[39:16] drunkenness and the cares of this life
[39:17] so that that day so that day come upon
[39:20] you unaware speaking of a a day that you
[39:23] ought to not be caught off guard by
[39:26] if you even dissect these scriptures
[39:28] the revealing of the son of man has lost
[39:30] its Wonder
[39:32] through Hearts being overcharged with
[39:34] surfeiting drunkenness and the cares of
[39:36] this life watch ye therefore in other
[39:37] words do not be snared
[39:39] take heed to yourselves be aware looking
[39:42] watch out for these things to be
[39:44] overcharged it means to be made heavy
[39:45] through excess
[39:47] the word there to be overcharged uh to
[39:49] be overcharged speaks of the idea of
[39:52] consuming so much it deadens your senses
[39:55] it kind of deadens your kind of dull to
[39:58] your rational senses surfeiting is a
[40:01] heaviness or a dizziness drunkenness
[40:02] means you're unable to think maturely
[40:04] you're unable to perceive or calculate
[40:05] and discern things maturely this is what
[40:07] the scripture is saying take heed to
[40:08] yourself listen any times your hearts
[40:10] become overcharged and your senses
[40:12] become dull through heaviness through
[40:14] drunkenness through the cares of this
[40:15] life it's an anxiety about temporal
[40:17] things it's an inordinate value given to
[40:20] temporal things
[40:22] something that you've placed way too
[40:24] much attention on or a value on be be
[40:27] aware of guard against
[40:30] if I can say this the destructive power
[40:33] of all these modern time wasters that we
[40:35] have
[40:37] that are empty that are vain
[40:40] in Romans chapter 13 verses 11 to 14.
[40:44] I I was gonna I preached this on a
[40:46] Wednesday night because I thought for
[40:48] sure all of our you know
[40:50] straight line Believers would be here
[40:51] tonight and you'd just be saying amen so
[40:53] much about for The Neighbor in the
[40:54] apartment next door and it just would
[40:56] have been like we just would have been
[40:57] shouting so much we'd have widened the
[40:59] aisles you know it just would have been
[41:01] a good old time
[41:03] I guess it's just sobering some of these
[41:06] things
[41:07] Romans chapter 13 verses 11 12 13-14
[41:11] Romans 13 11.
[41:13] I think this just speaks directly to us
[41:15] in these things and that knowing the
[41:17] time that now is high time to wake out
[41:20] of sleep these things are causing us to
[41:22] be drunk
[41:23] loneliness to sleep or it's Doling our
[41:26] senses it's the surfing and the
[41:28] drunkenness the cares of this life are
[41:29] overcharging our heart and we become
[41:31] dull our other senses are becoming dull
[41:33] because we're more in tune to the
[41:35] notifications we're more in tune to what
[41:36] the world is saying we're more concerned
[41:38] about the Tweets we're more concerned
[41:39] about the algorithm we're more concerned
[41:41] about the content consumption
[41:43] right these things are what catching our
[41:45] attention and it's causing us to fall
[41:46] asleep so it says awake out of sleep for
[41:49] now is our Salvation near than when we
[41:51] believed the night is far spent the day
[41:53] is at hand let us therefore cast off the
[41:56] works of darkness and let us put on the
[41:58] armor of light
[41:59] it's maybe an Old English language to
[42:01] you maybe archaic and Antiquated but
[42:04] it's telling us to get away to get
[42:05] distance from the things that tend to
[42:07] the anxiety get distance from the things
[42:09] that dull us to sleep to get distance
[42:11] from the things that are synthetic and
[42:12] not real
[42:15] and to put on the armor of light and
[42:17] start living
[42:19] start doing things that are worth doing
[42:22] it says let us walk honestly as in the
[42:25] day
[42:26] not in rioting and drunkenness not in
[42:29] Chamberlain chambering and wantonness
[42:30] not in strife and envying
[42:33] it's speaking to these passions these
[42:35] desires
[42:36] I have this drunkenness this rioting
[42:39] this chambering this wantonness this
[42:40] stripe this Indian these are all these
[42:42] things that are stirred up assignment
[42:43] these are all Old English words for the
[42:46] things that you're wrestling with day by
[42:47] day as you engage in these platforms and
[42:50] consume content
[42:52] just another way of saying it
[42:54] it's the work of Darkness
[42:56] when we need to be dressing ourselves in
[42:58] the armor of light and it puts it so
[43:00] beautifully in verse 14.
[43:02] but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[43:05] make not provision for the flesh to
[43:08] fulfill the lust thereof
[43:11] isn't it amazing how much provision we
[43:13] make for the flesh
[43:16] right to fulfill the lust thereof I'm
[43:19] trying to think of an example so I don't
[43:20] offend anybody here tonight
[43:23] it's amazing all the provision that will
[43:25] be made for a Thursday morning
[43:28] to be sure you make make it
[43:30] and nothing given to Wednesday night
[43:33] the extent to which we will make
[43:35] provision for the flesh
[43:37] the extent to which we will break our
[43:40] necks making sure we can get what we
[43:43] need for our flesh
[43:45] the desire the itch the scratch whether
[43:47] it be social interaction whether it be
[43:48] some Endeavor Recreation we'll do
[43:50] whatever we can to satisfy what our
[43:52] flesh needs but to fulfill the lust of
[43:55] the flesh but no provision to feed our
[43:57] spirit
[43:59] and I'll say this to those who are
[44:01] present here tonight you're making the
[44:03] right decision
[44:05] you may you may not be able to recognize
[44:07] it now
[44:08] but the benefit you get from taking your
[44:11] children from where they sit at home and
[44:13] driving whatever distance it is that you
[44:15] do to come here on a Wednesday night to
[44:17] sit in the atmosphere that you sit in
[44:19] and to hear the word and to worship will
[44:21] pay exponential dividends in your
[44:23] children's lives well beyond what you
[44:25] can get on the iPad the screen of the
[44:28] Stream
[44:29] I'm not downplaying the utility of
[44:31] streaming but if that's what God wanted
[44:32] us to do we'd all be there right now
[44:34] every single one of us we put all our
[44:37] money into having the right kind of
[44:39] bandwidth
[44:40] and that and we would be making sure
[44:42] that we could stream the best we can
[44:44] with all the pyrotechnics that we could
[44:45] but this is what God has ordained to
[44:47] make families healthy and strong
[44:50] make not provision for the flesh to
[44:53] fulfill the lust thereof
[44:56] this is a direct commandment to
[44:57] recognize desires that want to be
[44:59] fulfilled and say you know what I think
[45:01] I'm just going to starve you buddy
[45:03] I'm not going to make contingencies to
[45:05] have things so that I can continue to
[45:06] Satisfy My Flesh I'm going to recognize
[45:08] I'm going to wake up out of sleep I'm
[45:10] going to wake up out of the works of
[45:11] darkness I'm going to wake up out of the
[45:13] rioting and the drunkenness and the
[45:14] surfing and the overcharging and the and
[45:16] the anxieties by putting too much value
[45:18] on the things of this life I want to
[45:19] wake myself up to Hope
[45:22] I want to come back to life
[45:25] the Bible says in first Thessalonians 5
[45:27] 22 abstain from all appearance of evil
[45:32] speaking of keeping a safe distance
[45:34] from the for all forms of evil
[45:37] and I was just studying this scripture
[45:39] this week and getting into detail today
[45:42] and within the the framework of what
[45:44] Paul is encouraging them in
[45:47] it just almost hits you in your face
[45:48] that he's saying do not use the pretense
[45:51] of good
[45:53] to justify your your bad actions
[45:57] do not use the pretense of the good or
[45:59] usefulness of something to engage in an
[46:01] activity that tends to the flesh
[46:03] do not use the pretense of learning is
[46:06] he saying to Heap to yourself teachers
[46:08] that give you itching ears do not use
[46:09] any pretense of good or usefulness to
[46:12] engage in an activity that tends to
[46:13] something that's not useful we can say
[46:16] wickedness or evil here
[46:19] abstain from the appearance of evil God
[46:22] brings me back to all set no Wicked
[46:24] thing before me I want to achieve a safe
[46:26] distance from those things that are
[46:28] useless that can kind of get inside of
[46:30] me and cause me to start acting in ways
[46:32] that are habitual and have compulsion I
[46:34] want to recognize it I want to abstain
[46:35] from it I don't want to seek its
[46:37] approval no do I nor do I want to
[46:38] approve it I need to have healthy
[46:40] distance
[46:42] from all forms of evil
[46:45] I was reading this statement today where
[46:47] brother Madam tells this story and from
[46:49] that time he says the drunk I've met
[46:50] many of those that said brother Branham
[46:52] he says down the skid rows I think this
[46:54] is just so beautiful the way he uses it
[46:55] but I want you to think much deeper in
[46:57] terms of what your
[46:59] what Wicked way may be in you he says
[47:01] when I was in New York not long ago I
[47:03] won't have time to tell it but how did I
[47:04] picked up a drunk he was the president
[47:07] of a bank that I could look at from
[47:08] where he was because he's going from up
[47:09] from that time so one time he was the
[47:11] president of a bank
[47:13] he said I come home one night found a
[47:15] Dear John Letter I thought I would drink
[47:17] it away here I am
[47:19] he's a drunk on the street he says could
[47:22] you give me a quarter to get a drink
[47:24] he says there you are
[47:26] so think look at where it starts
[47:28] you know some is you're using something
[47:31] to kind of I just need a break right
[47:34] the job is stressful
[47:36] work is stressful life is stressful
[47:37] whatever it might be I just needed some
[47:39] release I need some sort of break and he
[47:40] said this is where it starts
[47:42] he says there you are they don't aim to
[47:44] do it
[47:46] they don't aim to become addicted
[47:48] they're not looking for some unhealthy
[47:49] compulsion the cigarette smoker that
[47:51] woman that smoked her first cigarette
[47:53] she didn't mean to become a tobacco worm
[47:55] that boy the first time you smoke that
[47:57] little corn silk cigarette whatever that
[47:59] is you didn't mean to become a cigarette
[48:01] fiend
[48:02] maybe in modern parlance you that picked
[48:04] up the Vape
[48:06] you didn't mean to become a vape fiend
[48:08] the first little social drink you took
[48:10] you didn't mean to become a drunkard
[48:13] see you don't mean to but it started
[48:15] because somebody influenced you to do it
[48:19] there's so many people after you
[48:22] said that's it all the stories of these
[48:23] 31 years around the world around and
[48:25] around hearing the confessions and
[48:26] things and to raise the hair on your
[48:27] head to think of the things that hear
[48:29] them confess of what they started how
[48:32] innocent it was and how beautiful sin
[48:34] looks and how attractive it looks to be
[48:35] but it's a way of death
[48:38] don't go at whatever you do shun the
[48:40] very appearance of evil
[48:43] now I know tonight if that's what I was
[48:44] harping on a cigarette use and alcohol
[48:46] abuse and social drinking and these
[48:49] things some of us might just breathe the
[48:51] sigh of relief but whoo I'm free from it
[48:53] but you know as the mental health toll
[48:55] has increased and as more young people
[48:57] feel a sense of hopelessness and feel a
[49:00] sense of dread or suffering from more
[49:01] anxiety that some drug use has declined
[49:04] uh you know sexual activity is declining
[49:07] but what is increasing is there
[49:09] dependency upon social media their
[49:11] interaction on these gaming platforms
[49:12] and it's causing greater and more is at
[49:15] least as much as destructive Behavior
[49:17] is all the things we might preach
[49:19] against if we were just wanting to
[49:20] clothesline
[49:22] just preach against cigarettes just
[49:24] preach against TV in the home just
[49:25] preach against rock stars and movie
[49:27] stars and preach against all The Usual
[49:29] Suspects and then just these other
[49:31] things just kind of slipping right on by
[49:38] I guess it'd be pretty hard to preach on
[49:40] these things if you use an iPad Pro for
[49:43] your notes
[49:44] an Apple Watch to keep track of the time
[49:47] and smart shoes to keep your feet from
[49:48] getting numb
[49:56] so what do I mean by
[49:58] desire detox
[50:01] I feel like I got at least 10 minutes
[50:05] I'm talking about experiencing real
[50:07] living
[50:10] lead me to the way Everlasting as almost
[50:13] put it
[50:15] we can experience real living
[50:18] when we free ourselves from toxic
[50:19] desires
[50:21] where we're no longer in bondage to the
[50:24] ones
[50:25] when we're no longer acting according to
[50:27] what we feel we think we need or what we
[50:29] want
[50:31] so what I'm proposing is a desired
[50:33] detoxification
[50:35] I've been thinking about these things
[50:36] person in my life I fellowship with some
[50:38] of you on this some of you shared with
[50:39] me some really
[50:40] tremendous examples of how the Lord has
[50:42] been dealing with you
[50:44] uh one one parent shared with me
[50:46] something that was just really really
[50:48] eye-opening and how that we're
[50:50] conditioning our children
[50:52] to when they need our attention whatever
[50:55] it is we're trying to finish is more
[50:57] important
[50:58] than what they're how they're trying to
[51:00] demand our attention because we're
[51:01] always in our screen
[51:03] for everything
[51:04] and it may be something useful but
[51:06] chances are it's probably not always
[51:08] useful
[51:09] but we use the useful moments as
[51:11] justification for all the wicked moments
[51:14] right they're useless
[51:16] the evil things that we we're not using
[51:18] this phrase of wow Wicked I I'm doing
[51:21] I'm doing something filthy and perverted
[51:23] on my phone no no you you've got an
[51:25] excuse for it but what's what message is
[51:28] it signaling
[51:29] and I'm proposing a desired
[51:31] detoxification
[51:33] I'm not suggesting a digital
[51:34] detoxification I'm not suggesting a
[51:36] detoxification from a cell phone
[51:40] but an examination of influence
[51:43] it's a desired detoxification
[51:47] it's it's detoxing our desires
[51:50] and maybe you desire a detox
[51:55] but it's taken intentional
[51:57] scriptural steps
[51:59] that's what it dawned on me today that
[52:00] the Bible is very plain in these things
[52:02] taking very intentional scriptural steps
[52:04] to Take Back Control of our minds
[52:07] Take Back Control of our bodies and our
[52:09] wants do we begin to recognize I'm being
[52:12] I have a compulsion to do something I
[52:14] have compulsion to check my phone once
[52:16] every six seconds in the evening I have
[52:17] a compulsion to check the status on this
[52:19] app I have a compulsion to check the
[52:21] news I have a compulsion to check the
[52:22] scores I have a compulsion to do to play
[52:24] this game I have a I'm set to a schedule
[52:26] where at this time I can always be found
[52:28] doing this and all my gaming buddies
[52:30] join me at the same time and I'm at the
[52:33] conference once a year and I'm doing the
[52:34] cosplay whenever I want and you can play
[52:36] the part in something that's not even
[52:38] real
[52:40] by your own want your own desire and
[52:42] there's a supernatural Christ who wants
[52:45] you to play his part by his own power
[52:48] we drag ourselves all over the place and
[52:51] let our wants drag us all over the place
[52:53] and we can take very deliberate
[52:56] scriptural steps to Take Back Control of
[52:58] our minds and our desires and our
[53:00] impulses
[53:01] Paul said in First Corinthians 9 27 but
[53:03] I keep under my body
[53:05] and bring it into subjection
[53:08] I know we've read this scripture quite a
[53:09] bit but he says I he's saying I make my
[53:12] desires my servants
[53:15] I don't let my desires make me the
[53:17] servant
[53:19] I keep under my body means I treat it
[53:21] harshly the phrase that's used as I beat
[53:23] it up
[53:25] and I make my body subject to me because
[53:29] my body my flesh my mind my desires are
[53:31] not my master
[53:33] that's what he's saying
[53:34] I keep under my body
[53:36] Paul is not saying you know ever since I
[53:38] became an apostle
[53:40] not one problem buddy right
[53:43] he's not saying it
[53:44] he recognizes that he in his body are
[53:48] desires wants and drive and he says I
[53:51] beat him down
[53:52] I bring him under subjection I'm I allow
[53:55] Christ in me to be the master of my
[53:57] wants and my desires if you say lest I
[53:59] when I've labored I do not receive a
[54:01] reward
[54:03] and so when I talk when I'm when I'm
[54:05] proposing a desire detox and I was very
[54:07] careful and I just tried to obey the
[54:08] Lord and with just exactly how I could
[54:11] present this because I'm proposing this
[54:13] to you
[54:15] and and you're the only one that can
[54:17] that can take steps uh to to the how you
[54:21] say Lord search my heart and see if
[54:22] there be
[54:23] any man or a habit in my life that's
[54:25] useless that's tending me to compulsion
[54:27] you're the ones that can examine
[54:29] yourselves and offer this up to the Lord
[54:30] one thing about accountability is it
[54:33] cannot be demanded it has to be
[54:34] voluntarily and willingly offered
[54:37] and so I'm not demanding accountability
[54:39] I don't need to have some sort of
[54:40] digital record you don't need to install
[54:41] uh you know the pastor's telescope on
[54:44] your your phone where I get to always
[54:45] look in on what you're doing
[54:47] or a pastor's microscope get the
[54:49] developers working on that it'd probably
[54:50] be a good idea right where at any time I
[54:53] can just pull up what you're doing oh my
[54:54] goodness look at this right you get all
[54:57] sorts of sermon material
[54:59] that's not the that's not the purpose of
[55:01] it and I could propose a digital detox
[55:04] and say everybody uh nobody play
[55:06] Flappy Birds for a month and we're all
[55:09] like
[55:11] okay right
[55:18] but it's about taking back control of
[55:20] our desires
[55:22] and I believe I mean this if you could
[55:24] take back control of your desires and
[55:27] that purifying that's what a detox is
[55:28] it's purifying it purges our thoughts
[55:31] Purge in our Spirits from these
[55:33] compulsions
[55:34] wonder will be found
[55:37] the Wonder lost will be I promise it to
[55:40] you I'm telling you according to the
[55:42] word of God the more you can do a
[55:45] desired detox where you're starving the
[55:47] carnal desires the more you'll find
[55:49] Wonder in the things of Christ
[55:52] and there's a lot of things that we
[55:54] could share with you
[55:55] that could be very practical
[55:58] but I've just I I just wrote a few down
[56:02] because there's different ways that you
[56:03] can do this
[56:04] and and this I believe there's
[56:06] intentional scriptural steps that we can
[56:08] take
[56:09] but I believe that when it comes to
[56:10] technology and media entertainment all
[56:13] these things that we should take
[56:14] intentional breaks from them
[56:17] that we should we should designate I I
[56:19] am going to get distance from this
[56:22] I'm going to prove that that's not
[56:24] doesn't have the power over me because I
[56:26] can determine when I when I check it it
[56:29] doesn't tell me when to look I'll look
[56:32] when I want to
[56:34] I I'm not going to be told that if you
[56:36] can if you do this by such and such time
[56:38] you get more points and if you respond
[56:40] to this by such and such time this will
[56:42] happen and that will happen in all the
[56:43] ways they're trying to entice you to
[56:45] engage and be manipulated into something
[56:46] you say no no no no no no no I I control
[56:49] this
[56:51] by the power that is in Me by Christ
[56:53] that is in me I'm going to keep under my
[56:56] body and and take these intentional
[56:58] breaks from these things
[57:01] you can do it by turning off
[57:02] notifications
[57:04] whether you do it during certain times
[57:06] or you just do it permanently
[57:10] I I actually I think for years now I
[57:13] don't even I don't have any vibration or
[57:15] sounds nothing on my phone where it's
[57:17] going to indicate to me when someone
[57:19] calls me or when they text me when they
[57:20] write me and and I did it because I
[57:23] don't need the notification I don't want
[57:24] the notification
[57:25] but all it did was just make you look at
[57:28] it more right because you don't know
[57:29] when it comes
[57:30] I used to say why are you staring at
[57:33] your phone I need to know when someone
[57:34] texts me
[57:35] why you just turn the ring around no no
[57:37] you don't do that because then it
[57:38] interrupts you
[57:40] it'll break your concentration
[57:43] right
[57:45] you could turn these notifications off
[57:47] you can there you could just delete the
[57:49] app
[57:51] all right just delete apps I think
[57:53] there's an app you can install on your
[57:55] phone to make phone calls
[57:57] just add that one
[57:59] right just use it to make phone calls
[58:02] but there's things you can do to create
[58:04] areas I've been reading a lot on this
[58:06] one brother shared with me that how as
[58:08] we begin to preach on this that he
[58:09] started uh just when he goes walks on a
[58:12] daily basis he leaves all the media
[58:14] behind
[58:16] but but the
[58:18] um anything let your moderation be known
[58:21] to all men so all the men
[58:23] in those think tanks and all those
[58:25] design groups
[58:26] and all the guys who are trying to
[58:28] figure out ways that you can always have
[58:29] something on you when you run
[58:31] right they want you to carry your watch
[58:32] they want you to carry your phone they
[58:34] want you to carry the smart vest right
[58:35] the integrated Under Armor that's
[58:37] telling you how you're breathing how
[58:38] much electric lights you're losing and
[58:41] we get so caught up in the metrics and
[58:43] the data and I'll just leave it behind
[58:45] and go on a walk
[58:46] so at least at some point in your life
[58:48] you're not you're not sensitized to
[58:50] everything that's taking place around
[58:52] you
[58:53] you could create areas in your life
[58:54] whether it be in your home or certain
[58:55] things here it's digital free
[58:58] whether we don't bring our cell phone to
[59:00] the the dinner table we don't when we're
[59:02] in The Homeschool Room we don't bring
[59:03] these things in there whatever it might
[59:04] be just create these or even just
[59:06] certain times of the day you say you
[59:07] know what during these times we're we're
[59:10] creating a Faraday Box we're closing
[59:12] these things off
[59:14] and I believe that you can intentionally
[59:17] purposely make time to connect with your
[59:19] family and friends that are right there
[59:20] with you
[59:22] or get this spend time alone
[59:27] like break up with Nancy from Tennessee
[59:29] right
[59:32] don't let her invade your thoughts when
[59:34] you're sitting there trying to take in a
[59:35] sunset
[59:36] be able to sit on a couch and do nothing
[59:40] just sit there
[59:44] and then when it starts to hurt keep
[59:46] sitting there
[59:48] when you start to get bored just keep
[59:51] sitting there
[59:52] and then I know what is it the voice we
[59:54] use the Garrison Keeler I need a
[59:56] cigarette voice from you know that when
[59:58] you start feeling elegant Elliot bring
[1:00:01] me my phone like no lock lock them up
[1:00:03] tie them down
[1:00:05] hey
[1:00:07] like just tie me to the mast
[1:00:09] I'm sailing
[1:00:12] right you force me to stay where I'm at
[1:00:17] as the siren song calls you to pick up
[1:00:19] your device
[1:00:20] to check in
[1:00:22] to find out yes yes football's over
[1:00:26] to remind yourself yeah who who was the
[1:00:29] Super Bowl MVP in 73 I need to know that
[1:00:32] right now
[1:00:34] they find yourself just sitting there I
[1:00:36] know if you could get distance if you
[1:00:38] could do a desired detox you can be more
[1:00:41] productive
[1:00:43] you could be more creative
[1:00:45] could be more useful
[1:00:50] we can become more present with one
[1:00:52] another
[1:00:54] we can nurture our personal
[1:00:55] relationships in a better way
[1:00:57] I think a desire detox just disconnect
[1:01:00] whatever's feeding that desire
[1:01:03] I could propose to you very specific
[1:01:05] things
[1:01:07] we could we could try to create some
[1:01:10] sort of 30-day challenge
[1:01:12] of this is what we're going to do
[1:01:14] and I think
[1:01:15] there's enough research and enough
[1:01:16] technology where we can all do that and
[1:01:18] implement it right
[1:01:20] but I want you to want it
[1:01:22] and and one thing I meant to say at the
[1:01:24] very beginning none of this and at no
[1:01:26] point in my heart has ever been
[1:01:28] like something explosive or exposing
[1:01:30] nothing corrective
[1:01:33] my whole inspiration is to be in my
[1:01:35] whole desire was to be inspirational
[1:01:37] I just want to inspire people to Christ
[1:01:40] to kind of awaken that Wonder of Christ
[1:01:44] to where even our children become
[1:01:46] enamored with the idea of the
[1:01:48] supernatural
[1:01:49] and there and you start to talk about
[1:01:51] Christ and you start talking about the
[1:01:53] things of God they're like well that's
[1:01:55] nothing Elon Musk is building a huge
[1:01:57] data center in Austin and it's bigger
[1:01:59] than any mountain and it's bigger than
[1:02:01] this and they're all enamored with all
[1:02:02] these rock stars you know did you know
[1:02:04] Jesus walked on water with in America
[1:02:06] can do this
[1:02:07] right
[1:02:08] you mean Jesus died huh
[1:02:11] they can keep our superheroes alive now
[1:02:14] and it's like there's just no attraction
[1:02:16] to the things of God
[1:02:19] and and what I'm proposing is to to not
[1:02:22] feed those desires a desire detox
[1:02:26] the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 13
[1:02:28] verse 5 thanks for the 10 minutes
[1:02:30] it says let your conversation be without
[1:02:33] covetousness
[1:02:34] and be content with such things as you
[1:02:36] have
[1:02:37] free hath said I will never leave thee
[1:02:40] nor forsake thee let your manner of Life
[1:02:43] be your let your habit or your custom be
[1:02:45] without covetousness there is a word
[1:02:47] that means the Love of Money
[1:02:50] covetousness speaks to the love of that
[1:02:53] gain money is what's used here
[1:02:56] it says be content
[1:02:58] with such things as you have
[1:03:01] and I would say this
[1:03:03] in light of the scripture covetousness
[1:03:05] extends Beyond
[1:03:07] just money
[1:03:09] but to that part of the mind that money
[1:03:12] stimulates
[1:03:14] because all these things we've talked
[1:03:16] about stimulate the same addictive
[1:03:18] neurons in your mind that money does
[1:03:21] when you get a paycheck and it
[1:03:23] stimulates the mind so do the fake
[1:03:25] points in your app
[1:03:26] stimulate the same point in your mind
[1:03:29] the the same part of your mind that
[1:03:31] responds to social rewards and more
[1:03:33] followers and more likes and more
[1:03:35] notifications when you're scrolling
[1:03:36] through Tick Tock and you're scrolling
[1:03:38] through all those YouTube shorts the
[1:03:39] same rewards you get out of the same
[1:03:40] part of the brain that responds to a
[1:03:42] paycheck
[1:03:44] and we have social rewards we have clout
[1:03:46] we have all sorts of ways of having gain
[1:03:48] or digital currency and it's that same
[1:03:50] way when the Bible says be without
[1:03:52] covetousness I believe it touches on all
[1:03:54] these things we're talking about
[1:03:56] and the way that he leads be without let
[1:03:59] your conversation be without
[1:04:00] covetousness be content I want to come
[1:04:02] back to contentment be content with such
[1:04:04] things as you have he says for he had
[1:04:06] said I will never leave thee nor forsake
[1:04:09] thing in other words this is where
[1:04:11] contentment is found
[1:04:13] this is what covetousness brings you
[1:04:15] away from when you're coveting the
[1:04:17] things that you feel like you don't have
[1:04:18] when you have the fear of missing out
[1:04:19] when you have the depression when you
[1:04:20] have the anxiety when you have the
[1:04:22] hopelessness the real drawback of all
[1:04:24] that is you forgot that he said the god
[1:04:27] of a Wonder said I'll never leave you
[1:04:29] nor forsake you your provision your
[1:04:31] protection your pleasure it says hey I'm
[1:04:33] right here
[1:04:35] I can entertain you beyond what you
[1:04:37] could think
[1:04:40] this is where contentment is found first
[1:04:42] Timothy 6 6
[1:04:43] but godliness with contentment is great
[1:04:46] gain I think it speaks of being
[1:04:48] satisfied with Christ
[1:04:52] contentment
[1:04:54] I know that there's a way maybe this was
[1:04:56] just in my mind but I suspect that some
[1:04:58] of you have the same thought
[1:05:00] that happiness
[1:05:03] we've redefined happiness to mean
[1:05:06] except what I have
[1:05:08] right
[1:05:09] you're poor just accept it
[1:05:11] you don't have anything just accept it
[1:05:12] and that's what we kind of try to
[1:05:14] shoehorn contentment to mean is be
[1:05:17] content with what you have you're broke
[1:05:19] you're poor you're bored you've got
[1:05:21] nothing you're you're carrying around an
[1:05:22] iPhone 6 whatever it might be just be
[1:05:24] content with it you're still using dial
[1:05:26] up or DSL be content with it right you
[1:05:29] don't have the latest and greatest be
[1:05:30] happy with it you're still on a Windows
[1:05:32] laptop be happy with it right we just
[1:05:35] kind of have this idea if you hey if
[1:05:37] you're settling for that I mean if
[1:05:38] you're just one of those people that go
[1:05:39] like Android that's fine you know just
[1:05:41] be happy with whatever you have
[1:05:43] but it doesn't mean that at all in the
[1:05:46] sense of settling but it means find the
[1:05:49] sufficiency in it in what you have
[1:05:52] to be of a truly have a happy mind it
[1:05:55] means to really rest in what you have
[1:05:59] to genuinely be satisfied in what you
[1:06:01] have telling you turn this around the
[1:06:04] world is trying to make you feel sick
[1:06:05] because you don't have something
[1:06:08] and what you don't have isn't even real
[1:06:12] and they're making you want a desire for
[1:06:14] something that has no substance
[1:06:17] and and to make you long for it and
[1:06:19] desire it when there's nothing to it
[1:06:21] that's the synthetic happiness
[1:06:25] that that's the things that'll never
[1:06:27] satisfy and so when it says be content
[1:06:29] the world is wanting you to settle for
[1:06:32] an alternative reality they want you to
[1:06:34] settle for digital currency they're
[1:06:36] wanting you to settle for things of the
[1:06:37] Flesh and the faster of this world that
[1:06:39] will always change when he says such
[1:06:41] things that I give unto you the things
[1:06:44] that I can provide you should find
[1:06:46] sufficiency in that
[1:06:48] like there's real happiness to be found
[1:06:50] in the way Everlasting There's real
[1:06:52] happiness to be found in Christ There's
[1:06:54] real happiness to be found in serving
[1:06:55] the lord There's real happiness to be
[1:06:57] found in serving others
[1:06:59] to be satisfied with Christ it means to
[1:07:01] rest and be said it means to give
[1:07:03] satisfaction to
[1:07:05] do you mind if I quote brother Benjamin
[1:07:06] Franklin
[1:07:08] he said we'll just disregard his French
[1:07:10] days and we'll just focus on some of the
[1:07:12] good he did for us but he says money
[1:07:14] never made a man happy yet nor will it
[1:07:18] remember let's use money as a
[1:07:20] placeholder
[1:07:22] and for let's just strive for
[1:07:25] directional accuracy instead of
[1:07:26] perfection on what he's meaning by money
[1:07:28] but let's use it as a placeholder of the
[1:07:31] things that excite our desire
[1:07:34] he said there's nothing in its nature to
[1:07:36] produce happiness
[1:07:38] I mean some of you need to really hear
[1:07:39] this
[1:07:40] all right
[1:07:42] that we think money is going to solve
[1:07:43] all our problems he says there's nothing
[1:07:44] in its nature to make make us happy the
[1:07:47] more a man has the more he wants
[1:07:51] instead of it feeling a vacuum it makes
[1:07:53] one
[1:07:54] it satisfies what satisfies one want
[1:07:57] excuse me if it satisfies one want it
[1:08:01] doubles and trebles that want another
[1:08:03] way
[1:08:06] and brother Benjamin said it perfectly
[1:08:09] in the 1700s
[1:08:11] exactly what's happening to us
[1:08:14] we think this is going to quench but if
[1:08:18] it fills some desire it triples a desire
[1:08:20] somewhere else it doubles a desire
[1:08:22] somewhere else because it's made that
[1:08:24] way by Design
[1:08:25] no Movie Maker no show script writer no
[1:08:28] no business no economy no ecosystem out
[1:08:32] there ever wants you to put it down and
[1:08:34] say I've had enough
[1:08:36] they want you to keep coming back for
[1:08:38] more
[1:08:39] but godliness with contentment is great
[1:08:42] gain brother Micah you could come
[1:08:44] musicians you could come godliness with
[1:08:46] contentment by the Lord you could come
[1:08:48] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:08:51] it's that finding that sufficiency in
[1:08:54] Christ
[1:08:55] finding my satisfaction this contentment
[1:08:58] is not settling this contentment is
[1:09:00] being awakened to true satisfaction
[1:09:02] and so he continues in verse 8 having
[1:09:04] food and reignment let us be there with
[1:09:07] content notice how it comes back to
[1:09:10] recognizing the base needs the things
[1:09:11] that are just the simple things the
[1:09:13] things that I could say in life I have
[1:09:15] what I need to perform my functions I
[1:09:16] have what I need I can use the world for
[1:09:19] what I need but I must not overuse it
[1:09:21] could I take a poll tonight does this
[1:09:23] mean anything to anybody here tonight
[1:09:25] does it does it strike a chord in your
[1:09:27] heart does it speak to something in your
[1:09:29] life does it inspire you as a parent to
[1:09:31] be more mindful of the battles our young
[1:09:33] girls are facing the battles that our
[1:09:35] young people are facing and the source
[1:09:37] of their anxiety and the source of their
[1:09:39] desires is because the world is right up
[1:09:41] there in their face all the time
[1:09:43] instigating desire instigating desire
[1:09:46] and we need to demonstrate from the top
[1:09:48] the godliness with contentment is great
[1:09:50] gain
[1:09:52] that having the things that are
[1:09:53] necessary and getting the use that we
[1:09:54] have out of the world let us be content
[1:09:57] but they that will be rich they that
[1:09:59] desire for more the trembling of a
[1:10:01] desire the tripling of a desire the
[1:10:03] Dublin of a desire fall into temptation
[1:10:05] and a snare
[1:10:07] and into many foolish and hurtful lust
[1:10:12] drowned men in destruction and perdition
[1:10:15] For the Love of Money
[1:10:18] is the root of all evil
[1:10:20] that's a that's a blanket statement
[1:10:25] he says which while some coveted after
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:28] they have aired from the faith and
[1:10:30] pierced themselves through with many
[1:10:31] Sorrows
[1:10:33] a desire detox is what Paul is proposing
[1:10:38] to Timothy
[1:10:40] Timothy be mindful as a young man he
[1:10:42] says flee also youthful lust
[1:10:45] lust of a particular age
[1:10:47] some of you may be sitting here in the
[1:10:49] service tonight
[1:10:51] thinking
[1:10:52] I don't even read my text messages
[1:10:55] I have my wife do that right
[1:10:57] there's things that you you're not on
[1:10:59] social media you don't have a Facebook
[1:11:01] footprint you don't have a digital
[1:11:03] footprint go ahead Google me brother
[1:11:04] Aaron you won't find anything about me
[1:11:06] you might have been able to abstain from
[1:11:08] all sorts of services and everything and
[1:11:10] you find yourself in no way impacted by
[1:11:14] this that's great I hope your takeaway
[1:11:17] is that the Temptation is real
[1:11:20] because youthful luster lusts that are
[1:11:23] appropriate for a certain age
[1:11:25] and some of us may not be the digital
[1:11:27] natives that these young people are
[1:11:30] growing up online
[1:11:31] some of us may have already been well
[1:11:33] into adulthood before these things begin
[1:11:34] to take shape or take hold so we're not
[1:11:36] prone to the same thing our brains were
[1:11:38] already fully developed certain things
[1:11:39] in our lives are already very very
[1:11:40] static and there was no elasticity to
[1:11:43] develop addictions of these things but
[1:11:44] our young people and their mind the most
[1:11:46] critical age of development are being
[1:11:47] bombarded with all this stuff it's not
[1:11:50] like it used to be where you could just
[1:11:51] be away from it and even when you go to
[1:11:53] message camps and you go to message
[1:11:55] meetings and you'd go to message church
[1:11:57] and you would go to a private school you
[1:11:58] could just get so much distance right
[1:12:00] from the world so much this is there's
[1:12:01] no distance anymore
[1:12:03] and we've got to find ways as Believers
[1:12:06] to detox desire
[1:12:09] to shut off the the the intoxification
[1:12:12] of the world to shut off all the
[1:12:14] contamination that comes through the
[1:12:15] world and these things that it's talking
[1:12:17] about that if we don't if we find desire
[1:12:19] getting the best of us it's what leads
[1:12:21] to hurtful us it's what incites and
[1:12:23] inflames Youthful us it's what excites
[1:12:24] passions where if we're following after
[1:12:26] it and where you have these addictions
[1:12:27] we have these compulsions we air from
[1:12:29] the faith and we Pierce ourselves
[1:12:31] through with many sorrows and so he
[1:12:33] proposes a desire detox he says oh man
[1:12:35] of God flee these things
[1:12:38] to talk yourself from these toxins
[1:12:41] purge yourself purify yourself from
[1:12:43] these toxins
[1:12:45] and fall after righteousness godliness
[1:12:47] Faith love patience meekness
[1:12:51] John Wesley wrote of this in general
[1:12:54] they may all be summed up in one
[1:12:57] Desiring happiness
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:02] so how how do I you know how do I take
[1:13:04] into perspective a desire detox and The
[1:13:07] Wonder of Christ how how am I going to
[1:13:09] take all these ways the world has its
[1:13:11] tentacles in me and then follow after
[1:13:13] righteousness and God in his faith love
[1:13:15] patience and meekness I've said this
[1:13:17] before and I'll present it to you this
[1:13:19] way that in talking about the Wonder
[1:13:21] lust and wonder lost we said we were
[1:13:23] going to begin to restore wonder by
[1:13:25] identifying the influences that cause
[1:13:27] the wonderlust because as long as you're
[1:13:30] wanderlusting it's going to be really
[1:13:31] hard for you to find the Wonder In
[1:13:33] Christ
[1:13:34] because your desire is going to drive
[1:13:35] you this way and you're going to have a
[1:13:37] desire that keeps pitting you to pursue
[1:13:39] and pursue and so what you need to start
[1:13:40] with is realizing wow this whole false
[1:13:44] economy has got me addicted
[1:13:46] all these platforms all these ideas and
[1:13:48] I know that some of you have used false
[1:13:51] pretense to continue to engage in things
[1:13:53] that you know aren't necessary and have
[1:13:56] no utility and you say you know what
[1:13:57] enough of it
[1:13:59] enough of it if you can't do it for your
[1:14:01] own self do as Christ did and sanctify
[1:14:03] himself for his children's sake
[1:14:05] for the disciples sake
[1:14:08] and if this I believe that if
[1:14:10] recognizing that the influences if we
[1:14:12] could start there
[1:14:14] with a desired detox
[1:14:16] that frees us up
[1:14:18] it begins to free us up and you have
[1:14:20] help in this
[1:14:21] you can ask God to help you it frees up
[1:14:24] your spirits and your minds and your
[1:14:26] attention and your time for the things
[1:14:28] of God
[1:14:30] it's not desire
[1:14:33] that's driving me but it is Desiring
[1:14:36] happiness out of God
[1:14:40] and I've used this example before this
[1:14:42] is what popped in my mind when I went
[1:14:43] down this path
[1:14:44] that they say that if you're depressed
[1:14:48] that diet and exercise or to the most
[1:14:51] important thing sleep diet next are
[1:14:53] three of the most important things you
[1:14:54] can get when you're depressed but guess
[1:14:55] what depression it makes it really hard
[1:14:57] eating right exercising sleeping at the
[1:15:01] appropriate times
[1:15:02] and then they tell you that the solution
[1:15:03] to your depression are is resolving all
[1:15:06] the symptoms of your depression you can
[1:15:08] like I don't know doc
[1:15:10] you sound like a quack to me how can I
[1:15:13] eat right if I don't feel right how can
[1:15:15] I exercise if I don't feel like I want
[1:15:16] to and there can just be this incredible
[1:15:18] uh like what what do I start with what
[1:15:21] do I start with you know that may be
[1:15:22] exactly how you begin to feel so
[1:15:24] inundated and uh and drunk with the
[1:15:28] things of the world you begin to think
[1:15:29] overwhelmed how is it I'm ever going to
[1:15:31] get out of this
[1:15:33] why don't you start Desiring happiness
[1:15:34] out of God
[1:15:36] all these things could be summed up in
[1:15:38] this Desiring happiness out of God come
[1:15:42] unto me he says
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:44] I propose a desire detox would you take
[1:15:47] it seriously with me
[1:15:51] I said Lord see try my heart and see if
[1:15:52] there be any object of pain
[1:15:57] any useless Habit in my life
[1:16:01] that is keeping me from the way
[1:16:02] Everlasting
[1:16:05] Stand Together
[1:16:06] [Music]
