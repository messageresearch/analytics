[0:01] hallelujah let's go to the lord in
[0:03] prayer together
[0:05] we want to continue to remember the
[0:08] pastor of jericho tabernacle brother
[0:10] johnny alvarez he's been
[0:11] intubated and placed upon a a ventilator
[0:15] we just pray that god would touch him i
[0:16] know there's others in his family that
[0:17] are not
[0:19] feeling well and we're just praying that
[0:20] god would touch that church right now i
[0:22] don't believe they're able even to have
[0:23] services
[0:24] so let's pray for jericho tabernacle and
[0:26] brother johnny alvarez
[0:28] many in our church who are traveling
[0:30] right now some that are still sick
[0:32] so let's just remember each need in
[0:33] prayer gracious heavenly father
[0:35] lord we are here tonight to see you
[0:40] and we rejoice to be able to see you and
[0:43] others
[0:44] as you look out upon the congregation
[0:45] and those that have gathered together
[0:48] we see you we see a testimony we see the
[0:50] hand of god
[0:52] the lord it encourages us we're
[0:54] encouraged by
[0:55] the people that we fellowship with those
[0:57] that gather together
[0:58] and lord it's even more invigorating to
[1:02] feel your presence come while we worship
[1:04] and to
[1:04] sense your nearness to us and lord
[1:08] just since feeling that dynamic of
[1:10] seeing brothers and sisters
[1:12] and being encouraged and then worshiping
[1:14] and
[1:15] being more encouraged and fill in your
[1:17] presence it builds an expectation to
[1:19] know
[1:19] that these this this fellowship and
[1:22] seeing one another and worship
[1:24] is building to the place to where you
[1:25] can come and take the bread of life and
[1:27] break it to us
[1:29] so lord as we stand in your divine
[1:30] presence we pray that you'd come
[1:32] bless the scriptures that are read the
[1:34] quotations that are shared
[1:36] lord the burden that has been placed
[1:37] upon my heart as i express it may you
[1:40] stand
[1:41] ready to quicken it to the believer's
[1:43] heart it may be something that
[1:44] encourages us
[1:46] father may it be something that
[1:48] instructs us and i pray lord that above
[1:50] all may it be something that allows us
[1:52] to surrender and
[1:54] yield that you might have a greater
[1:55] preeminence in our individual lives
[1:58] and that's what we long to see fathers
[1:59] not a more refined church service
[2:02] not a a better working church lord but
[2:05] rather
[2:05] christ in the individual heart coming to
[2:09] it's an individual coming to maturity in
[2:11] their position lord
[2:12] that's what we desire to cultivate to
[2:14] facilitate so tonight lord each one of
[2:16] us as individuals are surrendered to you
[2:19] have your way we pray in the name of the
[2:21] lord jesus christ
[2:22] amen amen let's turn in our bibles to
[2:26] luke chapter 24.
[2:28] luke chapter 24 and we'll read verses 27
[2:32] to 35.
[2:36] luke chapter 24 verses 37 to 35 again we
[2:39] say
[2:39] merry christmas to all of you it's so
[2:41] nice to have many of you out to the
[2:43] house the lord
[2:46] i know that it's a busy time right now
[2:49] and there's some that were not able to
[2:51] be here and it'll be more
[2:52] maybe not around this weekend with the
[2:54] traveling but we're glad that you're
[2:56] here tonight
[2:57] uh we far exceed the scriptural
[3:00] uh mathematics of where two or three are
[3:02] gathered and so we can be confident that
[3:04] christ is in our midst tonight
[3:06] and desires to speak to us but we share
[3:08] holiday greetings with you
[3:10] from my wife and i from our family we
[3:11] love each one of you dearly we're so
[3:13] happy to be together
[3:15] luke chapter 24 verse 7 27
[3:18] and we're continuing on the subject of
[3:20] who is my neighbor
[3:21] i felt perhaps maybe even tonight could
[3:23] be a climax or culmination but we'll
[3:25] just see
[3:26] luke chapter 24 verse 27 this is on the
[3:29] road to emmaus
[3:31] somebody shared something with me today
[3:33] minister shared something with me they
[3:34] said we all want to be like paul
[3:35] we want to be on the road to d-mask us
[3:40] kind of clever luke chapter 24 but this
[3:42] is the road
[3:43] to emmaus verse 27 and beginning at
[3:45] moses and all the prophets he
[3:47] christ expounded unto them in all the
[3:50] scriptures the things concerning himself
[3:53] they drew nyan to the village whether
[3:54] they went and he made as though he would
[3:57] have gone further but they constrained
[3:59] him saying abide with us for it is
[4:01] toward evening
[4:03] and the day is far spent and he went in
[4:05] to tarry with them
[4:07] and it came to pass as he sat at meat
[4:09] with them he took bread and blessed it
[4:11] and break and gave it to them their eyes
[4:14] were opened and they knew him
[4:15] and he vanished out of their sight and
[4:18] they said one to another did not our
[4:19] heart
[4:20] burn within us while he talked with us
[4:22] by the way and while he opened to us the
[4:24] scriptures
[4:25] and they rose up the same hour and
[4:27] returned to jerusalem
[4:28] and found the eleven gathered together
[4:31] and them that were with them
[4:32] saying the lord is risen indeed and hath
[4:34] appeared to simon
[4:36] and they told what things were done in
[4:38] the way and how he was known of them
[4:40] in breaking of bread you may be seated
[4:45] as we've been ministering on the subject
[4:46] of who is my neighbor asking ourselves
[4:49] that question who is
[4:52] my neighbor we could even be a question
[4:54] that we're asking ourselves as a church
[4:56] who
[4:56] who is our neighbor and uh i thought of
[4:59] even
[4:59] entitling the message tonight but i
[5:01] think we're going to be maybe
[5:02] uh just a little bit more focused in a
[5:04] way to where this wouldn't be
[5:06] maybe the appropriate title but the
[5:08] answer would be you are whoever
[5:10] who is my neighbor i if i would asking
[5:12] myself who's my neighbor i would look at
[5:14] those near me
[5:15] those i come in contact with and i say
[5:17] you are and you are my neighbor
[5:19] and uh we've wanted to use this parable
[5:23] of the good samaritan as a means of
[5:25] challenging us
[5:26] uh about our place and position within
[5:29] the community within the
[5:30] uh the city the the county the state
[5:33] that you live in
[5:34] and also to ponder the role that you
[5:35] have within a sisterhood of churches and
[5:38] those that you fellowship with
[5:40] and a lot of ways is to challenge
[5:42] certain prejudices and notions that we
[5:44] have and
[5:45] are really just bad habits that are
[5:46] really counterproductive to church
[5:48] because as a church
[5:50] you just the the mission and the goal
[5:52] ought to see that others are saved and
[5:54] others are healed and others are
[5:55] benefited by the gospel
[5:57] and if we become too insular in our
[5:59] experience and even the way that we
[6:00] congregate
[6:01] and the way that we view fellowship then
[6:03] the church is no
[6:04] is not effective any any beyond anything
[6:07] other than
[6:08] the activity that takes place within the
[6:10] four walls
[6:11] and i believe with all my heart that
[6:13] church does not exist to stand there
[6:15] and point people to come and gather
[6:17] where we are but rather it's a place
[6:19] that we assemble together where we are
[6:20] encouraged enriched by the word of god
[6:22] enriched by fellowship and the presence
[6:24] of the lord and then we go out
[6:26] and we live our lives as families in
[6:28] such a way to where we make a difference
[6:29] in our homes
[6:30] and then we make a difference in our
[6:32] communities our neighborhoods and
[6:34] that's the way that we ought to be
[6:35] living not this isn't the sum and
[6:37] substance tonight
[6:38] that's right i don't mean to make any of
[6:39] you feel bad but you have not climaxed
[6:41] tonight by coming to service but rather
[6:43] you've come to get something to feed
[6:46] your soul so that it makes something
[6:48] it makes a difference for you on
[6:49] thursday and so we do not
[6:51] live to go to church we go to church to
[6:53] live and in coming to church we receive
[6:56] something that feeds us that sustains us
[6:58] and then pushes us out into society and
[7:01] that's where we want to make a
[7:02] difference
[7:04] and we want to and we want to touch
[7:05] people's lives and we want to we want to
[7:07] live for others because that's eternal
[7:09] life and those are just some of the
[7:10] themes
[7:11] that have been burning in our hearts
[7:12] over these last few months as we've
[7:13] ministered on this subject
[7:15] and so i want to go back to the verses
[7:17] we were in luke chapter 10 verse 34.
[7:20] and these are the verses that we were in
[7:22] last time and we took
[7:24] the journey of this samaritan how that
[7:26] he
[7:27] came to where he was and we looked at
[7:28] this process of him humbling himself and
[7:31] the contrast
[7:32] to the priest and the levite and we read
[7:34] where it says and he came and he went to
[7:36] him
[7:36] and bound up his wounds and in the
[7:39] process of binding up the wounds one of
[7:41] the elements to this or two of the
[7:42] elements
[7:43] was pouring in oil and wine and it says
[7:46] that he set him on his own beast and
[7:48] brought him to and in and took care of
[7:52] him
[7:52] we identified this as our personal
[7:54] responsibility our personal duty
[7:57] to love our neighbors as ourselves
[7:59] because jesus
[8:00] in answering the question of this lawyer
[8:02] well who is my neighbor
[8:04] he could have just told the story there
[8:05] was a man on the wayside and he was
[8:06] wounded and a priest went by him and he
[8:08] didn't do anything a levite went by him
[8:10] and he didn't do anything
[8:11] but the samaritan came by and he helped
[8:13] him and he could have just used very
[8:15] quick language to make the point
[8:17] but jesus is also identifying what it
[8:19] means to love your neighbor
[8:21] and so he went through these steps of
[8:23] how he came to where he was and he went
[8:25] down to him
[8:26] and he bound his wounds and he poured in
[8:27] the oil the wine he
[8:29] set him on his own beast and then
[8:30] brought him to an end and we're going to
[8:32] focus on that particular aspect to
[8:34] bringing him to an end
[8:35] and took care of him we all have an
[8:38] individual responsibility as christians
[8:40] to live for others amen
[8:42] and and and we could say this in one
[8:45] sense if all you can do is pray
[8:47] pray if all you can do is give give but
[8:49] say lord i want to live for others
[8:52] use me for your glory let me be your
[8:53] hand extended let me be your eyes
[8:56] let me be your very heartbeat let me do
[8:58] something for others and so we have a
[8:59] personal
[9:00] individual responsibility to live for
[9:03] others
[9:03] and the elements that is that is used in
[9:06] binding up the wounds of this wounded
[9:08] one this one
[9:09] who had been befallen by unfortunate
[9:11] circumstance he uses oil which brother
[9:13] bam types to the spirit
[9:15] and wine which he types as revelation
[9:18] and we looked at how that these must be
[9:20] our personal possession
[9:23] we must have the holy spirit we must
[9:24] have revelation and if we have the holy
[9:26] spirit in revelation then we can be
[9:28] effective witnesses
[9:29] if you don't have the holy spirit it's
[9:31] very difficult to testify of
[9:33] the holy spirit if you don't have
[9:35] revelation it's very difficult to
[9:36] testify of the word of god but being
[9:38] possessors
[9:39] of a new birth experience being
[9:41] possessors of revelation
[9:42] then it's the source from which we
[9:44] minister and then it also becomes the
[9:46] means by which we minister
[9:47] or the elements that we minister with we
[9:50] have the holy spirit to give we have the
[9:52] revelation to share
[9:53] and it so it not only becomes the very
[9:55] basis of your experience and the thing
[9:57] that inspires you but it's something
[9:59] that you can inspire with and minister
[10:01] with
[10:02] and it's those things that'll minister
[10:04] to people's wounds to the lost and the
[10:05] hurting
[10:06] and so we were looking at our individual
[10:09] responsibility to love our neighbors as
[10:11] ourselves to care
[10:12] to minister to be concerned for others
[10:15] and so the samaritan if you look at
[10:17] verse 35
[10:18] he has brought this this man who is
[10:21] wounded and this man who was left half
[10:24] dead
[10:24] he brought him to an end and in taking
[10:27] him to the end this verse shows us that
[10:29] he didn't just drop them off but it says
[10:31] and on the morrow when he departed
[10:33] it means he was there with him in the
[10:34] inn he was there to look after him to
[10:37] care for him he brought him to a place
[10:39] that maybe he was familiar with but this
[10:40] man wouldn't be familiar with
[10:42] and he was there to help him acclimate
[10:43] he was there to meet his needs
[10:46] and then after he was when he departed
[10:48] he took out two pence
[10:49] and gave them to the host of the end and
[10:52] said unto him
[10:53] take care of him and whatsoever thou
[10:55] spend us more
[10:57] when i come again i will repay thee
[11:00] now if we looked at this parable and now
[11:03] as christ affords us an example if
[11:06] christ
[11:07] is viewed as the good samaritan in this
[11:09] parable then we must put ourselves
[11:11] in his footsteps we must place ourselves
[11:14] in his example and realize
[11:16] that if christ acted as the samaritan in
[11:18] this example
[11:19] then there's some measure by which we
[11:21] have to live our lives as the samaritan
[11:24] so we must be sacrificial we must be a
[11:26] servant we must give as christ gave
[11:28] but if we look at this as christ now
[11:30] being the samaritan who brought the
[11:31] wounded one to the end
[11:33] it's then christ that commissions the
[11:36] inn
[11:36] and the keeper of the end to serve this
[11:39] wounded sick one so christ
[11:42] does his part to take care of him but
[11:44] now there's a commission and i want to
[11:46] view this as a commission to the church
[11:48] to look after to the lost to look after
[11:50] the wounded
[11:51] to look after the hurting and after the
[11:53] sick it's something you've been
[11:54] commissioned to do
[11:56] but he has not left you without
[11:57] resources he gives you
[11:59] the pence that you need to minister with
[12:03] we'd read this statement i believe last
[12:04] time and i want to do it again just to
[12:06] see
[12:07] this pattern that we just raised brother
[12:09] branham is preaching a sermon and he's
[12:11] talking about these converts those of
[12:12] you who've received the holy spirit
[12:14] and he's identifying them and he he
[12:17] shows these ministers that are standing
[12:19] nearby he says all these ministers here
[12:21] were all just exactly the same the bible
[12:23] believing filled with the holy spirit
[12:24] promoting the word of god
[12:26] and we want you to join their church so
[12:28] you can continue on
[12:30] he goes now they are the the good
[12:32] samaritan he says now the good samaritan
[12:34] has come by
[12:35] poured oil in the wound but he's took
[12:38] you now
[12:39] and he wants you to go to one of the
[12:42] ends here
[12:43] the closest to you listen christ wants
[12:46] you to go to church
[12:48] and i say those things on a wednesday
[12:49] night because you get like 100
[12:51] amens when you say christ wants you to
[12:53] go to church and everyone's like yes
[12:54] amen we believe and so christ wants you
[12:58] to go to church
[12:59] there's a danger in not being in
[13:00] fellowship there's a danger not being
[13:02] part of a body
[13:03] a healthy body that can nurture you and
[13:05] that can fellowship with you and
[13:06] encourage you
[13:07] so he says he wants you to go under
[13:09] these ends here
[13:10] the closest to you he's done paid the pr
[13:13] the pastor
[13:14] to take care of you so he's paid and how
[13:16] has he paid and i believe this
[13:18] this should be viewed as things that the
[13:20] church has not just the pastor
[13:22] he's received the holy ghost got
[13:24] blessings of god and health and
[13:25] revelation
[13:26] so god has given gifts to men gifts to
[13:28] the church he's given blessings
[13:30] for your use and your benefit so when he
[13:33] says christ
[13:34] wants you to go to church because he's
[13:36] given the pastor he's given
[13:38] the innkeeper he's given them blessings
[13:41] and health and revelation
[13:42] it's not for the pastor it's not so he
[13:45] can look big and bad before the people
[13:46] but it's something he has as a servant
[13:49] to give
[13:50] out to others that they might be
[13:51] strengthened and they
[13:53] might be ministered to so he says they
[13:55] have the
[13:56] he has holy ghosts and blessings and
[13:58] health and revelation he can just
[14:00] feed your soul so you come now and join
[14:02] one of the churches
[14:03] and it'll be the best thing you can do
[14:05] to keep your spirit fed
[14:07] and moving on now if brother branham
[14:10] identifies this as one of the best
[14:12] things
[14:12] it'll be the best thing you can do to
[14:14] keep your spirit fed and moving on
[14:16] first we acknowledge that's because it's
[14:18] scriptural
[14:21] and then we also have to recognize then
[14:23] this is something that satan will fight
[14:24] against
[14:26] so satan is going to do everything he
[14:27] can to keep someone from going to church
[14:30] how we recognize it in our own personal
[14:32] lives he's going to do things to try to
[14:33] keep us from going
[14:34] and for those uh who maybe are in the
[14:37] practice in the habit of going there's
[14:38] certain things that intervene
[14:40] uh that keep us from being making
[14:42] different services and being as
[14:43] consistent as we would like
[14:45] and we are we're able to overcome that
[14:47] and we fight through it and we get back
[14:48] on track and that's because we have a
[14:50] desire to be in service and we recognize
[14:52] satan's fighting us
[14:53] but then there's a if i could just say
[14:55] this and i wasn't maybe anticipating
[14:57] saying it this early there's a lot of
[14:58] things about church that can keep people
[15:00] away from church
[15:02] you don't be that reason you should
[15:05] challenge i don't ever want to be the
[15:06] reason that someone doesn't want to go
[15:08] to church
[15:09] because if we're not careful we could be
[15:11] the very reason that people don't want
[15:12] to go to church and church is the reason
[15:14] why people are missing church
[15:16] why because church has become something
[15:18] that church shouldn't be
[15:20] so we should all as individuals labor
[15:22] and strive
[15:23] to create the right kind of atmosphere
[15:25] too to reach out in a particular way and
[15:27] have the right kind of attitude towards
[15:29] centers towards the loss
[15:30] to people maybe there might be people
[15:32] you that that come and visit the church
[15:34] and you may know him for years and like
[15:36] i've never really liked that person
[15:37] you are now being challenged to humble
[15:40] yourself
[15:41] find out why that's there and overcome
[15:43] it amen
[15:44] that's great because christ wants us
[15:47] to be welcoming brother branham says in
[15:50] jezebel religion he says remember the
[15:52] good samaritan that found the man
[15:54] wounded he brought him to the end and
[15:56] brother man says
[15:57] that's the church so we've already seen
[16:00] how in the prior quotation he says
[16:02] that the these pastors there they're in
[16:04] keepers they've been gifted with things
[16:05] they've been given things
[16:06] to look after those who are going to
[16:08] come to the end come to a church be a
[16:10] part of a church
[16:11] and brother brandon again here
[16:12] identifies the church as the n
[16:15] in the parable of the good samaritan so
[16:17] when we
[16:18] are commissioned to love our neighbors
[16:20] as ourselves
[16:22] then we have a resource available to us
[16:24] that oil and revelation the word the
[16:26] spirit and revelation
[16:28] we minister to our neighbors those that
[16:29] we come in contact with our family
[16:31] members
[16:31] but then we also have a place that we
[16:34] can invite them to come
[16:36] and in coming god continues the ministry
[16:39] continues the serving and continues to
[16:41] work to see that the person
[16:43] is not just told the truth but by the
[16:46] truth made free
[16:47] and made whole so it's not it's not all
[16:51] upon you
[16:53] and sometimes we do take that
[16:54] responsibility i'm trying to answer
[16:56] these questions and i'm trying to get
[16:57] this person to see and i've been
[16:59] witnessing to my co-worker and i've been
[17:00] witnessing to this person i've been
[17:02] trying to get them to see
[17:03] well god has a place that you can bring
[17:05] them
[17:07] and and you don't have to worry about
[17:08] what's preached and what's sung
[17:10] there's a there's a dynamic about this
[17:12] place about
[17:13] this inn where god will deal with hearts
[17:16] as he pleases
[17:18] and it's wonderful to be a part of a
[17:20] church where you're happy to invite
[17:22] somebody to it
[17:24] and i believe that we ought to be
[17:26] excited to invite people to witness of
[17:28] this great truth that we have and
[17:30] welcome them to church
[17:31] and you can literally tell them come to
[17:33] the end
[17:34] right because we're meeting in a hotel
[17:35] right now you could tell them come to
[17:37] the end come to a place
[17:38] brother says he brought him to the end
[17:40] that's the church and gave the man their
[17:41] two pence
[17:42] told him that if he needed any more he'd
[17:44] pay him when he come
[17:46] so he's got two pence he's able to
[17:47] doctor you up if he's a man of god
[17:49] if he's a man of god that stands on the
[17:51] word of god he's got what god gave him
[17:53] the spirit and the word so we're looking
[17:56] at this
[17:57] this dynamic of how we have this
[17:59] individual personal responsibility
[18:01] to live for others and we would do that
[18:03] outside of these four walls we would do
[18:05] that
[18:06] outside of our just going to church but
[18:08] then in coming
[18:09] but then and being a part of a body and
[18:11] part of a church
[18:12] we now as a church collectively have a
[18:14] responsibility
[18:16] to care for the ones that the
[18:17] individuals are ministering to
[18:19] so that we we help we assist we do we
[18:22] look into what we can do to help
[18:24] and we we provide by virtue of our
[18:26] church services
[18:27] a place of safety and a place of comfort
[18:30] where the lost the hurt in the wounded
[18:32] could come
[18:32] and be healed and it's our love for
[18:36] others then that would compel us to
[18:37] guide them to
[18:38] the end and we saw last time my brother
[18:41] says you you want to get in there
[18:43] put your shoulder to the wheel do all
[18:45] that you can and serve so we have a role
[18:46] that we play
[18:47] within the church we should be praying
[18:50] and asking god
[18:53] i would say not just even within the
[18:54] church but asking god show me
[18:56] my purpose show me my position let me do
[18:59] all that you want me to do
[19:00] amen and i believe that we all have a
[19:02] part to play with in the local assembly
[19:04] brother branham says in the message
[19:05] doors in door he says every door opened
[19:08] and and even in your heart oh just touch
[19:11] the little button and watch them all go
[19:12] right around
[19:13] the circle say come in lord jesus be my
[19:15] lord and all
[19:16] lord of my lord my all and he continues
[19:19] to sing oh let me from this day
[19:21] not let you stand at the door be holy
[19:24] thine
[19:25] and he says you that raised your hands
[19:27] and wants to be farther
[19:29] led towards the lord i ask you to go
[19:32] down to the revival of night tonight
[19:34] and i'm sure the pastor there would take
[19:36] you from here to the
[19:38] inn he has six pence whatever was given
[19:40] it was two pence to take care
[19:42] the oil and the wine to pour in he can
[19:45] finish
[19:45] the job and that's the function of the
[19:49] church not just the pastor
[19:51] because if the pastor could just finish
[19:52] the job then maybe just hey this is
[19:54] where i live
[19:55] give you my gate code or whatever you
[19:56] come come see me and you come to me and
[19:58] i'll finish the job but it's something
[19:59] we do as the body
[20:01] because it's something that the even a
[20:05] genuine pastor realizes you're not all
[20:06] here because of him he's here because of
[20:08] you
[20:09] right that's the only reason why a
[20:12] pastor is where he is is because there's
[20:13] people there that need ministry
[20:15] and so he is dependent upon the people
[20:18] he realizes the only reason why i'm here
[20:20] is because there's
[20:20] the people of god need to be ministered
[20:22] to and i'm a servant and i have a gift
[20:24] so god used this gift for the people's
[20:26] benefit
[20:27] and so it's not just the pastor because
[20:29] i don't believe churches should be
[20:30] pastor-centric
[20:31] it should be word-centric and
[20:33] christ-centric and so in reading this
[20:35] statement it's just merely to identify
[20:37] that we as a church have the elements
[20:39] and the dynamics
[20:40] to bring people to the end and be
[20:42] ministered to by jesus christ
[20:44] he says i'm sure he would take you here
[20:46] to end it speaks of the church
[20:48] and the church then is equipped to see
[20:50] that the job that christ started is
[20:52] finished
[20:54] because christ is going to do it he's
[20:55] going to finish it and he's asked us to
[20:57] be co-laborers with him in that process
[21:00] bill branham again i'm just using these
[21:02] statements to show that we as a church
[21:03] should identify ourselves in this
[21:05] parable
[21:06] of the good samaritan wherein the
[21:07] question is answered who is my neighbor
[21:10] and the question is answered what does
[21:11] it mean to love my neighbor as myself
[21:13] we are identified in this parable as the
[21:16] end
[21:17] in the message jesus christ the same
[21:19] yesterday today and forever he talked
[21:21] about his meetings in bombay italy said
[21:22] recently excuse me bombay
[21:24] india recently there was no way of
[21:26] saying we couldn't get the churches to
[21:28] cooperate
[21:29] because of the cooperation we went under
[21:31] another church
[21:32] and some of the churches were down on
[21:34] them and that started the rest of them
[21:36] to down this group
[21:37] isn't that a shame just a shame
[21:41] but the people come anyhow amen
[21:44] it's such a it says it's such a bad
[21:46] thing if we can get the ministers to
[21:48] cooperate so that the man when he's
[21:50] converted
[21:50] he can have a church home to go to he
[21:54] says if you turn him back
[21:55] turn him back out into the devil's pig
[21:57] pen then he'll come right back again
[21:58] just like he was
[22:00] but if you've got a place that you can
[22:01] direct him to some good
[22:03] and then this is where he comes again to
[22:05] the end like jesus with the samaritan
[22:08] he taken him to the end he said the good
[22:11] samaritan
[22:12] taken the fallen man to the end he says
[22:14] we've got to have a place
[22:16] like that and i would encourage you
[22:19] to be in a place where you can do just
[22:22] that
[22:23] you you don't want to be you do not want
[22:25] to have the kind of experience
[22:26] where you drag yourself to church
[22:28] because you got to check that box
[22:30] because in the back of your head you
[22:31] know brother branham said that a
[22:32] believer will be there when the church
[22:33] doors are open
[22:34] it's like ah church doors are open i
[22:36] guess i need to be there but you want to
[22:37] have a place like brother branham's
[22:39] identifying here
[22:40] a place where you can send somebody to
[22:43] he says and you can have a church home
[22:45] to go to so it's not just a church it's
[22:47] a church home
[22:48] what is home what kind of what does it
[22:49] mean to have a home it's a place that
[22:51] evokes thoughts of safety and comfort
[22:53] and belonging in family in nurturing
[22:57] homes should not conjure up images of
[22:59] abuse and threatenings and manipulation
[23:01] and control
[23:02] homes should conquer conjure up images
[23:04] of warmth and
[23:05] safety something inviting something
[23:07] welcoming and we ought to be those that
[23:09] are identified in the scripture
[23:11] as a samaritan together with christ
[23:12] where we have a place that we can bring
[23:14] people to
[23:15] and it's all of our responsibility to
[23:18] have the right kind of attitude create
[23:19] the right kind of atmosphere
[23:21] to see that this can be a home church
[23:23] not just a church but a church home
[23:27] he says but you've got to have that
[23:28] place to direct somebody to he says
[23:30] we've got to have
[23:31] a place like that let it be our prayer
[23:34] as arizona believers church lord
[23:36] make this place like that
[23:39] make it a church home make it a place
[23:42] that even an end
[23:43] and we ought to be unselfish in this way
[23:45] lord even if it's an end that means it's
[23:47] a place that someone comes for a time
[23:50] to rest and be strengthened and then god
[23:53] would take them and place them somewhere
[23:54] else
[23:54] we can rejoice in that amen we can
[23:58] rejoice that even if before a season
[24:00] god would let our body minister to
[24:02] somebody and then he would take them and
[24:03] place them somewhere else
[24:04] use them for his glory somewhere else or
[24:07] put them in another place where they
[24:08] could be ministered to
[24:09] and taken further we rejoice in that
[24:11] amen
[24:12] oh god our prayer make us make us that
[24:14] kind of place
[24:17] brother bram says and god hath provided
[24:19] a way god hath provided a way
[24:22] all right at the way provided i might
[24:24] have missed a letter there in the title
[24:26] he says like the traveler that fell
[24:28] coming from jericho
[24:30] from jerusalem to jericho and they took
[24:33] him to the inn
[24:34] the little provided place and they
[24:37] poured some oil in and give some money
[24:39] and he got well
[24:41] let's i believe god this would be my
[24:44] my conviction and i don't like to share
[24:46] my my testimony or my conviction or my
[24:48] opinion but i will say this my
[24:50] conviction is
[24:51] this is a little provided place
[24:54] and maybe you can testify for yourself
[24:56] that god has given you some healing
[24:59] and poured in some oil and wine and been
[25:01] ministered too but this is our thought
[25:03] process as the church
[25:04] let us be a little provided place for
[25:07] the weary traveler
[25:08] let us be a place where people could
[25:10] come and hear the word of god preached
[25:12] and
[25:12] fellowship with others who have a
[25:13] christ-like spirit there's no judgment
[25:16] there's no condemnation there's no
[25:17] arrogance there's no belittling there's
[25:20] no elitism that comes with it that we've
[25:22] tore down walls of clicks and social
[25:24] constructs that
[25:25] separate people and god let us be a
[25:27] place where of whatever
[25:28] ethnicity whatever background whatever
[25:30] struggle whatever difficulty they have
[25:32] that it's not our dynamic personalities
[25:35] but it's the preeminence of christ that
[25:37] makes people feel welcome
[25:40] you may be somebody that's very wealthy
[25:42] and you can live luxuriously
[25:44] and you have uh nice things but if
[25:46] you're christ-like in your spirit
[25:48] then the poorest perfect person could
[25:50] come and rub
[25:51] shoulders with you and say that somebody
[25:54] that i like and somebody i can benefit
[25:56] from
[25:56] amen don't have to all have the same
[25:59] social background and the same
[26:01] opinions on certain things and all love
[26:03] to eat at ritos or all of us wear the
[26:05] same kind of clothes
[26:06] but it's the nature in the spirit of
[26:08] christ that becomes the magnetism
[26:10] that draws people so we don't try to
[26:13] just create
[26:14] a church where everyone dresses the same
[26:15] everyone acts the same and everyone does
[26:17] the same thing and everybody buys the
[26:19] same things because
[26:20] oh oh is that what he drives that's what
[26:21] i want to try oh that's where he that's
[26:23] where i want to eat but we so we don't
[26:24] want to all just become a commune where
[26:26] we all have things in common
[26:27] and that's what begins to bond people
[26:29] together but let it be the preeminence
[26:32] of christ
[26:32] that becomes a magnetism therefore all
[26:35] men
[26:35] all men can be drawn unto him
[26:39] a little provided place
[26:43] in the scripture romans chapter 15
[26:45] verses 5 to 7
[26:47] i hope this can i hope this could just
[26:49] mean something more to you though
[26:51] they're familiar
[26:52] but just kind of let it kind of strike
[26:54] you a little bit differently
[26:55] now the god of patience and consolation
[26:57] grant you to be
[26:59] like-minded one toward another according
[27:02] to christ jesus
[27:03] we ought to have the mind that he had
[27:05] and we ought to have the same attitude
[27:07] towards the center towards the weak
[27:09] towards the lost towards the hurting
[27:10] and even toward the the arrogant and
[27:13] blind
[27:14] we ought to have the same attitude
[27:16] towards them that we be like-minded one
[27:18] toward another according to christ so
[27:19] he's talking about our attitude towards
[27:21] others the way that we perceive
[27:23] others our knee jerk reactions to others
[27:25] he says that you may be with one mind
[27:28] in one mouth glorify god even the father
[27:30] of our lord jesus christ so there must
[27:32] be unity
[27:33] there must be harmony selfishness breaks
[27:36] unity
[27:37] selfishness builds walls makes you eat
[27:39] you could even be within a church
[27:41] very selfish and you just build walls
[27:43] around yourself
[27:46] and he says in verse 7 wherefore receive
[27:49] ye one another
[27:50] as christ also received us to the glory
[27:53] of god
[27:54] welcome one another be inviting to one
[27:57] another
[27:59] be hospitable to one another receive ye
[28:01] one another
[28:02] he says so we're welcoming we're being
[28:04] hospitable we're opening up ourselves to
[28:05] one another it says
[28:06] as christ as christ also received us
[28:10] whew there goes every excuse right
[28:14] as christ also he said what did he
[28:15] receive in your own arrogance
[28:18] and your own ignorance if we could maybe
[28:20] uh bring everybody into that fellowship
[28:21] maybe just not a couple of us
[28:23] but in your own weakness and sin and
[28:26] your own confusion and your hurting
[28:28] in your imperfection in your brokenness
[28:30] christ received you in your brokenness
[28:32] christ received you and your hurting
[28:34] christ received you in your confusion
[28:36] christ received you in the state that
[28:38] you were in when you turned
[28:40] and likewise we can as the church of god
[28:43] we can do as paul says receive you one
[28:45] another as
[28:46] christ received you i can take you as
[28:49] you are
[28:50] but i've got the goods and i've got
[28:52] something by a gift of god as a church
[28:54] as a believer i've got oil i've got wine
[28:57] i've got blessings
[28:58] i've got health i've got revelation you
[29:00] don't have to stay the way you
[29:01] are there's something that we've got
[29:04] where god can mend brokenness
[29:06] he can deliver he can set free we stand
[29:09] confidently as ones that bear this power
[29:12] bear this ex
[29:13] this ministry to see that others are
[29:16] saved
[29:17] and others are healed so brother brad
[29:20] i'm identified as the two pence
[29:22] healing and salvation we've got it
[29:25] do you have it you have it let me when i
[29:28] say we i'm not using the royal we as an
[29:30] eye i'm using we as in all of us who are
[29:31] here
[29:32] all of us who are part of this
[29:33] fellowship we have the bride of christ
[29:35] she has these things
[29:36] the healing and the salvation
[29:40] there's a beautiful type in there he
[29:41] says then if you need more
[29:43] this will i bring when i come the church
[29:46] has had healing and salvation but in
[29:48] this last days she needed something
[29:50] to take rapture in faith and he's come
[29:54] he's given us the more and the opening
[29:55] of the word to get us out of here
[29:57] it's just beautiful types contained in
[29:58] these scriptures now so he says we are
[30:01] to receive one another we're like minded
[30:03] towards one another
[30:04] according to christ and wherefore to be
[30:06] welcoming we're to be inviting to one
[30:07] another
[30:08] in hebrews chapter 13 verses 1 to 3. now
[30:12] i share this to challenge us because
[30:15] we're very quick to
[30:17] make certain calculations i had a
[30:19] brother share with me
[30:21] a very dear friend who said that he
[30:23] realized
[30:24] that he was very quick to assess
[30:27] somebody
[30:29] and essentially place a value on them
[30:31] and i realize i'm kind of using my own
[30:32] words right now
[30:34] and then very quickly determine just how
[30:35] much time he wants to invest in them
[30:39] i said the lord was just really
[30:40] shattering those notions
[30:42] of how quickly we just calculate these
[30:44] things and say well it's probably not
[30:46] worth the effort
[30:47] listen it's all worth it yes we use
[30:50] wisdom to not cast our pearl
[30:52] before swine and we use wisdom to not
[30:54] caustically share the gospel to condemn
[30:56] somebody
[30:57] and we want to use wisdom in the way
[30:58] that we share it and and we ask god to
[31:00] guide us and delete us but listen the
[31:02] efforts that you take
[31:03] to see that someone could just be
[31:05] delivered from something or
[31:06] they have a confusion a remedy and their
[31:09] lives just made better and made easier
[31:11] and our marriage restored
[31:12] it's worth every effort amen
[31:16] and not make some uh just some decision
[31:19] that well if it doesn't result in this
[31:21] it's not worth it it's worth it
[31:23] it's worth it to labor
[31:26] in hebrews chapter 13 verses 1 to 3 it
[31:29] says let brotherly love continue
[31:32] be not forgetful to entertain to invite
[31:34] to welcome
[31:35] and i believe in one place that says
[31:37] allow
[31:38] them to lodge and if we look at it as a
[31:41] church
[31:42] it will allow those to come and remain
[31:45] terry
[31:46] he says be not forgetful to entertain
[31:48] strangers for thereby some of
[31:49] entertained angels unawares
[31:54] we can be very quick to kind of assess
[31:56] somebody and
[31:57] kind of get an idea well this is where i
[31:59] think they're at and this is what i
[32:00] think they're worth
[32:01] and the bible actually tells us
[32:04] to let brotherly love continue
[32:08] and be not forgetful to entertain
[32:09] strangers
[32:11] because you never know when it's an
[32:13] angel that you're ministering to
[32:17] and so then we have to we have to have
[32:20] this maybe as a constant reminder
[32:22] lord i don't ever i i never have license
[32:26] to mistreat
[32:27] anyone i know we've mentioned that
[32:30] many many times there's no place in the
[32:32] scripture where it says
[32:34] we're told be christ-like and be
[32:35] forgiving and be
[32:37] be uh be humble and serve and then it
[32:40] says
[32:40] except when this
[32:43] and then you can be unchrist-like
[32:47] are we always trying to figure out lord
[32:48] when it when when can i braid this whip
[32:50] i've been carrying this thing with me
[32:52] i want to know when i can flip over
[32:53] tables and toss out the money changers
[32:55] i want to know when i can do that let's
[32:57] not look for those opportunities
[33:00] let's look for opportunities to serve
[33:01] and humble ourselves and do what we can
[33:03] to render aid and
[33:04] and to minister to somebody because the
[33:06] bible's saying don't be afraid don't be
[33:08] forgetful to minister to
[33:10] one to tarry with somebody to give
[33:12] strength to them
[33:13] he says for thereby some have
[33:14] entertained angels unawares not even
[33:16] knowing but they've ministered to angels
[33:18] he said remember them that are in bonds
[33:21] as bound with them
[33:22] so now you're putting yourself in their
[33:24] shoes in them which suffer adversity
[33:27] as being yourselves also in the body
[33:31] serve by putting yourself in their
[33:33] position if they're in bonds
[33:35] remember them that are in bonds as if
[33:37] you were in bonds with them those that
[33:38] are suffering adversity
[33:40] be as being also with them in the body
[33:44] that maybe just to bring it into current
[33:46] events
[33:47] maybe there's some of us who i heard
[33:49] that someone we knew or someone we loved
[33:51] had coveted 19 we said well we're
[33:53] praying for you
[33:54] and then you got it and then after that
[33:57] when you found out somebody
[33:58] says i'm praying for you why because you
[34:01] could empathize you could put yourselves
[34:03] yourself in their shoes and you're like
[34:05] hey man i'm praying a little bit
[34:06] differently than i was praying
[34:07] uh march through july i'm praying a
[34:10] little bit differently than i was before
[34:11] why
[34:11] because you have the ability then to
[34:14] empathize with what they're going
[34:15] through
[34:16] and paul is saying let's labor if we can
[34:18] to be empathetic
[34:19] if someone's in bondage of sin hey
[34:22] which one of you was it right so that we
[34:25] could pray for them as having been one
[34:27] that was bound let us never forget what
[34:30] we were
[34:30] right i was reading in the scripture in
[34:33] the god hiding himself in simplicity
[34:35] today
[34:35] and brother branham was talking about
[34:37] how there was no room for jesus at the
[34:39] end and we're going to
[34:40] at the end and we're coming to that here
[34:42] in a moment and he was saying there he
[34:43] was in a manure-filled
[34:45] barn and he's born in a manger and he's
[34:47] born in this and he's born in that
[34:49] and there's no room for him and he's
[34:50] turned out and rejected and he says but
[34:52] there's but he came it came to something
[34:55] later
[34:55] it's kind of what it refers to and and
[34:58] as christ comes to his glory and he
[35:00] comes to his majesty
[35:01] but we should never forget the origin of
[35:03] it how it begins in humility and may we
[35:06] never none of us ever forget what we've
[35:09] come from
[35:09] amen now remember our humble beginnings
[35:13] you say also i could always be beat over
[35:15] my head so that i could always be under
[35:16] the bondage of it so i could hover over
[35:18] me as a shadow
[35:19] no you look back on it victoriously you
[35:22] look back on it as being made more than
[35:24] a conqueror
[35:24] you look back at it as somebody says
[35:26] that is what i've been brought out of
[35:27] you're looking down at the pit
[35:29] you're looking down at what once
[35:31] tormented you and what's haunted you
[35:33] just as the scripture says the whole
[35:34] world the saved and redeemed will look
[35:36] back at satan and say
[35:37] this is what tormented us you're looking
[35:39] back as a conqueror
[35:41] and in looking back and remembering what
[35:42] you came from when you see
[35:44] somebody else who's befallen by the same
[35:46] thing you can then
[35:48] enter into ministry and do empathetic
[35:50] prayers say lord
[35:51] i know what they're going through amen
[35:54] i understand their pain their bondage
[35:57] and how they could be so overwhelmed
[35:59] with something
[36:00] and if we don't forget that we were
[36:01] there before
[36:03] then we could look on it with compassion
[36:05] instead of
[36:07] so typical
[36:10] they asked for it remembering them
[36:15] we can entertain angels unaware we need
[36:17] to receive one another be welcoming
[36:20] what does jesus say in matthew 25 40
[36:22] because he said there's those that are
[36:24] going to enter into
[36:26] glory on at the day of white throne
[36:28] judgment i was going to say when i was
[36:30] hungry you fed me when i was sick
[36:32] you ministered to me when i was naked
[36:34] you clothed me
[36:36] when i was in bond you visited me and
[36:38] the people are going to go when
[36:41] when did we do that and he says in so
[36:44] much as you've done it under the least
[36:45] of these
[36:46] my brethren you've done it unto me
[36:49] do you realize then how that if there's
[36:52] those who are going to
[36:54] enter into life on that day for the way
[36:57] that they minister
[36:58] to the body of christ as brother brown
[37:00] uses the phrase that we're good to the
[37:02] bride
[37:04] then you realize we likewise have that
[37:06] responsibility
[37:08] that we're not just living for somebody
[37:10] we're not just uh when it says love thy
[37:12] neighbor as thyself and we think oh well
[37:13] i've got to do that to this
[37:15] unbelieving cruel you know and we go
[37:17] through all this list of reasons why we
[37:19] don't think we should love
[37:19] no you don't know who you're witnessing
[37:22] to you don't know who you're ministering
[37:24] to
[37:25] in so much as you've done unto these the
[37:26] least of my brethren you've done it unto
[37:29] me
[37:30] so we read last time brother says
[37:31] whatever you do to somebody you're doing
[37:33] it unto christ
[37:35] do you remember that whatever you do to
[37:37] somebody
[37:39] you're doing it unto christ if you lie
[37:42] about them
[37:43] you're lying about christ if you're
[37:46] hurtful towards them you're hurtful
[37:47] towards christ
[37:48] well brother aaron they've told me they
[37:50] don't believe the bible they flat out
[37:52] denied
[37:52] well i witnessed them about the message
[37:54] and they said it was a bunch of nonsense
[37:55] and i'm in a cult and they even cussed
[37:56] about brother branham
[37:57] and they said this about christ they did
[37:59] this and they did that whatever you do
[38:00] to them
[38:02] you're doing it unto christ
[38:05] i i almost feel like i could have just
[38:06] come tonight and just kind of shared
[38:08] that and
[38:08] played a game of telephone and made it
[38:10] go through make sure everybody got it
[38:11] and if we really sat there and pondered
[38:13] it
[38:13] we just like
[38:16] and we kind of all leave going i got to
[38:18] go home i mean it really really struck
[38:20] us
[38:21] the full weight of it washed over us and
[38:23] we'd be like
[38:24] i really owe that cashier at dollar tree
[38:26] an apology
[38:29] yeah i really oh that person in the
[38:32] drive-thru chick-fil-a an apology
[38:34] because whatever you do to them you're
[38:37] doing it unto christ
[38:39] would that not change everything you're
[38:42] on the phone with amazon
[38:44] customer support listen i'm telling you
[38:46] buddy
[38:48] you know wait a minute i'm talking to
[38:49] christ hold on
[38:52] if and you realize this is just maybe
[38:54] some best practices
[38:55] do you realize if you if you tell
[38:57] somebody i'm at your mercy i know you
[39:00] have control i know this is at your
[39:01] discretion i'm coming to you i'm asking
[39:03] you because i know you're the person who
[39:05] can help me
[39:06] that you just could completely change
[39:08] the dynamics so you're actually speaking
[39:10] to the one whatever you do to somebody
[39:11] you're doing to christ
[39:12] you're acknowledging your humble
[39:13] yourself to somebody on the other end of
[39:14] the phone
[39:15] and you're empowering them to get what
[39:17] you need done
[39:18] instead of saying hey listen buddy i've
[39:20] been buying from you guys for three
[39:22] weeks now you realize how much money i
[39:23] spent 23
[39:24] and 40 cents and if you don't treat me
[39:26] right you're going to lose a customer
[39:27] buddy
[39:28] you're like so long bye-bye
[39:32] right they're just see ya not to scare
[39:35] anybody but you know why they have all
[39:36] these rewards programs
[39:38] they want to find out who's shopping and
[39:40] not making them money
[39:41] and i think one day the door's just
[39:43] going to be locked when we show up
[39:45] you're always buying on clearance and
[39:46] returning we don't want you in here
[39:48] anymore
[39:51] but coming back let's get back on track
[39:54] here
[39:55] just the season season of returning and
[39:58] giving i've often said if you don't
[39:59] believe in return ministry
[40:01] my wife has one
[40:05] but whatever you do to somebody you're
[40:06] doing it unto christ this ought to be
[40:08] instructive to us
[40:11] as i pondered these things and was
[40:12] coming i just loved how the
[40:14] the momentum of this came to this place
[40:16] as we identified the church as the end
[40:19] in this parable
[40:20] in luke chapter 2 as we read sunday here
[40:23] comes this season
[40:25] of what we now know to be we call it
[40:27] christmas season
[40:28] but in that time they were to come
[40:30] together to be taxed
[40:32] and as their as they are the days of
[40:37] uh mary's come accomplish to be
[40:38] delivered in verse seven luke chapter
[40:40] two verse seven
[40:41] she's with child and and joseph had to
[40:44] come
[40:44] uh to bethlehem it did to everyone had
[40:47] to come to his own city to be taxed
[40:50] and it says and there when she comes to
[40:51] the town and and the stories dramatized
[40:54] and told actually came across the
[40:55] statement where brother brown says i
[40:56] know everybody preaches this time of
[40:58] year
[40:58] that there's no room at the end he says
[41:00] so i'm going to go a different direction
[41:01] i thought wait a minute
[41:02] i was i want to mention that tonight and
[41:04] i didn't take it as a
[41:06] a big stop sign but it is common no room
[41:09] at the end no room at the end so we
[41:11] understand how it's dramatized that
[41:12] families are coming into the city and
[41:14] maybe being late to come
[41:16] for this time to be taxed they're going
[41:18] to end after inn and
[41:20] lodge after lodge and place after place
[41:22] and there's no place for joseph
[41:24] and his pregnant wife to lodge there's
[41:27] no place like there was even for the
[41:28] samaritan
[41:29] and the wounded man when he came in they
[41:31] would have had a bed and would have a
[41:32] place for them to sleep
[41:33] but it says that she brought forth her
[41:35] first born son and wrapped him in
[41:37] swaddling clothes
[41:39] garments that were fit for animal use
[41:41] and laid him in a manger this is not not
[41:43] a crib
[41:44] this is not a bed this is because there
[41:46] was no room for them in
[41:48] the inn now we realized that those in
[41:52] that day were not
[41:53] being told the messiah is she's carrying
[41:56] the messiah will you make room for them
[41:58] it wasn't put in those terms but yet we
[42:00] take from that
[42:02] the example that was said in the
[42:04] scripture and the type
[42:05] that christ is not always welcome
[42:08] there was no room he was not welcome
[42:09] there was no place made
[42:12] and this should challenge us as a church
[42:15] that as we are told that we should be
[42:17] like-minded one toward another receive
[42:19] you one another's christ receive you
[42:21] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[42:23] because you may be entertaining angels
[42:24] and in so much as you've done unto the
[42:26] least of these my brethren you've done
[42:28] unto me
[42:28] we ought to be welcoming and inviting
[42:31] and create an
[42:31] atmosphere that others when they come
[42:34] they can be
[42:35] ministered to and helped and encouraged
[42:37] while they're here
[42:38] and we cannot do that unless christ is
[42:41] welcome
[42:43] there's a lot of effort made sometimes
[42:45] with in nominal christianity and modern
[42:47] bible churches
[42:48] to try to make a place real hip and real
[42:50] cutting edge
[42:51] and real welcoming to people so that
[42:53] they can feel like hey i this is this is
[42:55] groovy i like this i could get along
[42:57] with this this
[42:58] is i really like the cut of your jib
[42:59] pastor this is a place that i can get be
[43:01] comfortable in but they have not
[43:03] welcomed christ
[43:06] and the only way that we can make a
[43:08] church a place where difference can be
[43:09] made is if we
[43:10] welcome christ brother abraham says in
[43:13] the deity of jesus christ today the
[43:15] church has soup suppers pie suppers
[43:17] see who can dress the best go into the
[43:19] church for pomp glory
[43:21] who's the best church the best seats who
[43:23] can play this who can do that let it
[43:26] challenge us
[43:26] as a church that we never get into these
[43:28] these metrics and ways of judging things
[43:31] when we're looking at the amenities and
[43:32] the worship and the in the
[43:33] instrumentation
[43:34] and the syncopation of the choir and how
[43:36] fat they get on that
[43:37] in the bridge let's get all that out of
[43:40] our minds that's not what's going to
[43:41] make this church a difference maker if
[43:43] christ is going to be the one that's a
[43:45] difference maker
[43:46] soup suppers pie suppers who can dress
[43:48] the best go into the church for palm
[43:50] glory who's the best church the best
[43:51] seats who can play this who can do that
[43:53] and no room no room for who christ
[43:58] all the times they got all times they
[44:01] got something else to do besides prayer
[44:03] they can't pray anymore they got
[44:05] something else to do they can't pray
[44:06] anymore
[44:07] they just can't serve god like they used
[44:09] to no room for him in the inn
[44:12] and this is the end time friends no room
[44:14] for him in the end
[44:16] he says of course i know what that end
[44:18] meant
[44:20] but i've been referring to this end what
[44:22] is it about the church
[44:25] just as the church is the end and the
[44:27] parable of the good samaritan the church
[44:28] is represented here in luke chapter 2
[44:30] verse 7.
[44:31] the end had no room for me says and he's
[44:33] now rebuking the church and challenging
[44:35] the church he says there's no room for
[44:36] him in the end
[44:36] i'm referring to this end and he makes a
[44:39] very very striking reference
[44:41] and if you want to go back and read it
[44:42] it's in ecclesiastes chapter 12.
[44:44] brother brahma is quoting verses five
[44:46] and six you can read those first several
[44:47] verses there
[44:48] at how there's um nothing better for a
[44:51] man and he's talking about the vanity of
[44:53] man and his labor and his work and what
[44:55] it ends up in
[44:56] and then brother man takes this and
[44:58] places it
[44:59] in his rebuke of the end but the bible
[45:01] said in that day when the almond tree
[45:03] shall flourish
[45:04] the desire of men shall fail because he
[45:06] goes to his long home
[45:08] and this is a phrase that was referring
[45:09] to death to the grave
[45:11] and the mourners go about the streets
[45:13] and the civil court be broken or the
[45:15] pitcher broke in the fountain
[45:17] we know brother brandon comes back later
[45:19] and refers to churches as being broken
[45:21] cisterns and the stagnant
[45:22] old stale traditional bound by ideas and
[45:26] and humanism the broken cisterns and he
[45:28] uses this
[45:29] scripture in references to churches
[45:32] being an end and it's speaking the
[45:33] scriptures are speaking of
[45:34] vanity and death and what is brother
[45:38] brown and i did define
[45:39] your church becomes one of these long
[45:41] rooms one of these broken cisterns where
[45:44] it's deaf there's no life to be
[45:46] given out there's no health there's no
[45:47] revelation there's no real ministering
[45:49] taking place because it becomes very
[45:51] staid very traditional
[45:52] very structured very rigid and it
[45:54] becomes very humanistic and when that
[45:56] happens christ is not welcome
[45:58] in christ not being welcomed there's not
[46:01] the life giver
[46:02] the health giver the savior and the
[46:04] healer there
[46:05] to do what he can do
[46:08] what a profound scripture for him to
[46:11] inject in this rebuke of the ends
[46:15] and i believe that we make christ
[46:16] welcome by making others welcome
[46:21] christ is welcome if we are welcoming to
[46:23] others
[46:25] our atmosphere must be christ-like
[46:28] creating the right kind of atmosphere
[46:32] as i read in luke chapter 24 in the
[46:34] beginning i'll narrow it down to verses
[46:35] 28 to 31.
[46:38] these disciples of christ are
[46:40] heartbroken and they're discouraged and
[46:42] they're
[46:43] walking along the road back home and
[46:46] christ draws near to him and
[46:49] he's like man why are you guys so sad
[46:50] why are you so gloomy they go man have
[46:51] you not heard are you a stranger
[46:53] have you not heard what happened about
[46:55] jesus and a man mighty of god and
[46:57] a man believed to be the messiah and
[47:00] after it's been three days since he's
[47:02] dead and now they go to the
[47:03] the tomb and he's empty and christ
[47:08] rebukes him oh fools and slow of heart
[47:11] why because he heard them rehearsing
[47:13] words back to him
[47:15] that he had spoken in three days
[47:19] told him that ought to have been things
[47:21] that clicked form things that happened
[47:22] they were going along discouraged
[47:24] he says and they drew nine to the
[47:25] village and he opened up the scripture
[47:27] to them and espounded to them christ
[47:29] says they drew not into the village
[47:30] whether they went and he made as though
[47:32] he would have gone further
[47:35] what is that it's kind of it's it's a
[47:37] situation where it's kind of like uh
[47:38] well
[47:40] i'm not really interested i'm gonna keep
[47:42] going you guys you guys have fun i'm not
[47:44] interested you guys go
[47:45] you guys can go in i'm not really
[47:47] interested
[47:49] but then it says but they constrained
[47:51] him saying abide with this
[47:53] for it is toward evening now brother
[47:56] brahm takes this
[47:57] and we often think that it's that we use
[47:59] it as
[48:00] their house and this is one of these
[48:01] disciples homes and he goes in
[48:03] and this is the this is where one of
[48:05] them would have lived but brother
[48:06] branham takes it in several places and
[48:08] he says this was an inn
[48:10] that they were coming into for the night
[48:11] because it was getting too late and they
[48:13] had a longer journey
[48:14] and they needed to stop for the night so
[48:16] as the night was coming on
[48:17] they say abide with first towards
[48:19] evening the day is far spent
[48:21] and and it's we can't keep traveling now
[48:23] now is the time to stop
[48:24] and because they constrained him and
[48:26] said remain with us
[48:28] carry with us you know why don't you
[48:30] stay tonight with us
[48:31] let's come in let's carry together
[48:33] tonight says and he went into
[48:35] terry with him he kind of acted like he
[48:38] didn't want to go
[48:40] but they weren't they weren't happy with
[48:42] that with that
[48:44] they wanted more they wanted to implore
[48:45] more they wanted to take the extra step
[48:47] and they constrain him they'll abide
[48:49] with this terry and it came to pass as
[48:51] he sat at meat with him he took bread
[48:53] and blessed it and break and gave to
[48:55] them and their eyes were open and they
[48:57] knew him
[48:58] and he vanished out of their sight and
[49:00] how was it this
[49:01] very how was it it came to this place
[49:04] this would not have happened had he said
[49:07] no
[49:08] i'm not i you know i'm good i'm going to
[49:10] keep going and they said all right
[49:12] your loss right
[49:15] their eyes would have never been opened
[49:17] they would have never had a message to
[49:19] go to the eleven and those that were
[49:20] with them and say
[49:20] he's risen and appeared to simon they
[49:23] would have still been just as confused
[49:24] and even more confused like man that was
[49:26] amazing this guy just talked to us and
[49:28] all these scriptures it was remarkable
[49:30] but when they came when he constrained
[49:32] them to stay in the
[49:33] inn come abide with us tarry with us
[49:36] it's
[49:36] then that there was this fellowship that
[49:38] happened and in the breaking of the
[49:39] bread he was made known to them
[49:42] in the placing of the word of god and
[49:44] brother branham says and who is this
[49:45] melchizedek
[49:46] but still they never recognized it all
[49:48] day long they walked with
[49:50] with you and still didn't know you but
[49:53] night come they constrained you to come
[49:56] in
[50:01] and when they went into the little end
[50:02] and closed the doors
[50:04] then you did something just the way you
[50:06] did before your crucifixion
[50:08] and they recognized it was the risen
[50:10] christ
[50:11] he said in another place those very
[50:13] words it wasn't until
[50:14] they came into the inn
[50:18] it says when you when they came into the
[50:20] little inn and closed the doors
[50:22] that's where the revelation was opened
[50:24] up to him in the message when their eyes
[50:26] were opened they knew him
[50:28] notice here's the thing to do the next
[50:30] thing we find out they
[50:32] invited him to come in he got to the
[50:35] little place the little end where they
[50:37] were going to stay
[50:38] it was towards the evening and they said
[50:39] oh come and abide with us
[50:41] he made out like he was going on past oh
[50:44] i thought that many times
[50:46] he's only wanting you to invite him he
[50:49] made out like he would pass them on by
[50:51] he might make out like he's going to
[50:53] pass you by sister in the wheelchair
[50:55] or you sir in the cod are you out there
[50:57] with heart trouble that can't live but
[50:58] just a little
[50:59] while longer these people are perhaps
[51:01] crippled they might live an ordinary
[51:02] lifetime
[51:03] but somebody out there with heart
[51:04] trouble might die before the morning
[51:06] might die before tomorrow
[51:08] he might act like he's going to pass you
[51:10] by but he's only wanting you to invite
[51:13] him that's what he's wanting you to do
[51:17] it might even seem like god you're
[51:19] straying a little bit but it's one he's
[51:21] like jesus
[51:22] oh god come to my defense come to my aid
[51:25] come to my need he's wanting you to
[51:28] invite him
[51:30] to welcome him i i just this
[51:33] this thought keeps coming in my mind as
[51:36] i was looking at this on the parallel
[51:37] paths we want to welcome christ we'll
[51:39] invite
[51:40] christ he may seem to want to pass us by
[51:42] but we're compelling lord no come
[51:43] that's why we come 30 minutes early
[51:45] because we're praying lord
[51:47] come visit us today and we're praying
[51:50] for those that we know have needs we're
[51:52] praying for those that we don't need
[51:54] something
[51:54] oh god be mighty god come and step
[51:57] upon the scene lord do use use the song
[52:00] service lord be with the minister who as
[52:01] he preaches
[52:02] you say oh lord i know he has a tendency
[52:04] to veer off this way so lord you just
[52:06] take them
[52:06] bind them close to the burden that
[52:08] you've given them and we're praying and
[52:09] we're creating an
[52:10] atmosphere and we're welcoming and we're
[52:12] inviting it's the very purpose for song
[52:14] service
[52:15] to wash our conscience to create an
[52:17] atmosphere to let the holy spirit come
[52:19] by
[52:19] because we want to welcome christ so he
[52:22] can what break bread
[52:24] and in the breaking of bread be made
[52:25] known to us but then there's also on the
[52:28] along the same path we're wanting to
[52:30] welcome others we're wanting to be
[52:31] inviting
[52:32] we want to be something that compels
[52:34] someone to say this is a place where i
[52:35] know i can get something
[52:37] that i need and here recently i was
[52:41] fellowshipping with a young man and i
[52:45] i said to him as he was talking and he
[52:47] was asking questions and i said well
[52:48] um why don't you why don't you take my
[52:50] number down and if you want to ever
[52:51] reach out or
[52:52] i'll come visit the church you know you
[52:54] could you could come and the
[52:55] conversation just continued and i was
[52:57] like well i'm not gonna
[52:59] i'm not going to say well don't you want
[53:01] my number
[53:02] it's a really catchy one zero one two
[53:04] three i mean you you might really like
[53:05] it
[53:06] but i just uh i thought well we just
[53:08] continued to
[53:09] open up and witness and and share some
[53:11] things and then all of a sudden he just
[53:13] said
[53:13] can i have your number i want to go to
[53:14] church
[53:17] and i could have taken offense right
[53:18] there at the beginning i could have been
[53:19] like oh you don't want my number
[53:21] well i got to go right but there was
[53:24] like there was a constraining
[53:26] there was a change he made as though he
[53:27] didn't really matter to him
[53:29] and sometimes it could be that with
[53:30] people i'm not interested i don't know
[53:32] but let's not just be so quick to give
[53:33] up
[53:34] if you know somebody's hurting you know
[53:36] somebody's lost you know you've got
[53:38] the more that they're looking for you
[53:40] know you've got something that can
[53:41] minister to their needs
[53:43] don't be so quick to just let them go
[53:45] but say oh god let me tariff with them
[53:47] let me constrain them
[53:49] tell them come abide come to the end
[53:51] that you can get what you need says you
[53:56] might act like
[53:57] he might act like he's going to pass you
[53:58] by but he's only wanting you to invite
[54:00] him
[54:00] you might think well he's healed so and
[54:01] so the other day last month two years
[54:03] ago i sing yeah
[54:05] he might act like he's going to pass you
[54:07] by but he's only wanting you to invite
[54:09] him
[54:10] he makes out like he's going to pass
[54:12] what he was then he is today
[54:14] what he does then he does today he said
[54:17] so notice
[54:18] you must do the same thing you've got to
[54:21] invite
[54:22] him in it was then and
[54:25] only then that he could reveal himself
[54:30] i said it was then and only then yes the
[54:33] journey was important yes it laid a
[54:35] tremendous foundation
[54:36] but when they constrained him to come
[54:38] into the end
[54:40] to come into the place where the word
[54:41] could be rightly divided was then
[54:43] then that he revealed himself
[54:46] and it's instructive to us to invite him
[54:49] invite them into your family situation
[54:51] invite them into your work situation
[54:52] invite him into your health needs invite
[54:54] him
[54:54] welcome him he's waiting to be invited
[54:59] in christ let me say this christ needs
[55:01] to be welcome here
[55:02] in this physical gathering in our church
[55:04] in our fellowship he needs to be welcome
[55:08] and as if as we make christ welcome and
[55:10] we welcome others we are not inviting
[55:12] people to a church experience
[55:16] if you want a church experience there's
[55:18] better church experiences out there
[55:22] they've got a lot more programs a lot
[55:24] better things to offer
[55:25] a lot better light show
[55:28] right you know a lot more you know
[55:31] hip hip acquire and worship bands and
[55:34] everything there's this
[55:35] there's a lot of church experience out
[55:37] there you can get better
[55:38] but what you want is you don't want
[55:39] people to have a church experience do
[55:41] you want them to have an experience with
[55:42] christ
[55:46] and it's our attitude it's our
[55:49] expectation that we have when we come to
[55:50] church we come to church and we're just
[55:52] it's our expectation that creates an
[55:54] atmosphere
[55:56] it's our vision what we come wanting to
[55:58] accomplish what we're trying to do
[55:59] all that projects christ to the people
[56:03] if we're humanistic if we're carnal if
[56:05] we're bitter if we're upset and
[56:07] and there's grudging and all different
[56:10] things if there's the wrong motive and
[56:11] objective then we come
[56:12] we're projecting that and people will
[56:15] come and visit be like yeah i just
[56:16] didn't feel welcome
[56:20] and then we're very quick to be like
[56:21] well that just kind of shows what
[56:22] they're made of
[56:25] all right let's let's let's challenge
[56:28] ourselves
[56:29] if we're ever rebuked if we're ever
[56:31] corrected if anyone who even is an
[56:33] unbeliever ever has something negative
[56:36] to say to us
[56:37] let's first examine ourselves before god
[56:40] and say god was it warranted
[56:41] amen did i give them reason to believe
[56:44] that i would lie
[56:45] did i give them reason to believe that i
[56:47] didn't have their best interest in mine
[56:48] oh god let it not be true what they had
[56:51] to say about me
[56:53] be amazing what you can accomplish when
[56:55] you can humble yourself to somebody and
[56:56] say i'm sorry
[56:58] and they're like oh i kind of have
[57:00] expected you to
[57:01] really let me have it what's the goal
[57:04] that they could see christ
[57:06] our attitude our expectation the way we
[57:08] behave it projects christ to people
[57:11] so we must create a welcoming atmosphere
[57:13] for christ
[57:15] we must create that kind of atmosphere
[57:16] for christ and for those who need him
[57:21] brother braham says in the message god
[57:22] hiding himself in simplicity now i think
[57:24] it's our duties talking about the church
[57:26] and the remodeling of the church and how
[57:27] beautiful
[57:28] the church was and how nice it had
[57:30] become he says now i think it's our duty
[57:32] to make the inside right by the grace of
[57:34] god
[57:37] whose duty is it it's your duty your
[57:40] duty
[57:40] your duty to make the inside right with
[57:42] the inside the atmosphere
[57:45] the the the the way people feel the way
[57:48] people interact he says it's our duty we
[57:50] have that duty we say oh lord i showed
[57:51] up at church i'm here i'm 30 minutes
[57:53] early where two or three are gathered in
[57:54] my name there you'll be in the midst you
[57:56] come on do it lord
[57:57] make it dynamic make it inviting make it
[57:59] welcome you know it's our duty to do it
[58:01] amen by humbling ourselves he says this
[58:03] will just not only be a beautiful
[58:04] building
[58:05] that will come to but may everyone who
[58:07] comes in see the beautiful
[58:09] characteristic of jesus christ
[58:11] in every person that comes in that's
[58:14] what we dress ourselves in before we
[58:16] walk through that door
[58:17] lord let me be let me portray the
[58:19] beautiful characteristic of jesus christ
[58:22] we don't know who's going to be visiting
[58:24] us today lord i don't know who's going
[58:26] to be coming amongst us
[58:27] i don't know who i might run into in the
[58:28] foyer i don't know who i might come in
[58:30] contact with after church
[58:32] but lord may i be dressing in the
[58:34] beautiful characteristic of jesus
[58:36] christ that everyone who sees me will
[58:38] see something different
[58:41] be salty
[58:45] may it be a consecrated place to our
[58:47] lord a consecrated people
[58:50] let us be a provided people in a
[58:52] provided place but they're going to call
[58:53] the end
[58:54] the little provided place i want to be a
[58:56] little provided person
[58:57] in that little provided place he says
[58:59] maybe a consecrated place
[59:01] to our lord a consecrated people for no
[59:03] matter how beautiful the structure is
[59:05] that we certainly do appreciate the
[59:07] beauty of the church is the character of
[59:09] the people amen
[59:12] i trust it'll always be a house of god
[59:15] of beauty
[59:17] by what the character of the people
[59:23] brother branham says and god provided
[59:25] way for this god's provided way for this
[59:27] day
[59:28] did that resonate with you the beauty of
[59:30] the church is the character of the
[59:31] people
[59:32] and it's our duty to make the inside
[59:34] right
[59:36] where christ would feel welcome
[59:42] god's provided way for this day it says
[59:45] remember
[59:47] the education wouldn't be the instrument
[59:49] to lead them to god's provided place
[59:53] and he's usually the example and he
[59:55] comes to hear a second how
[59:56] those ducks how when they when they go
[59:59] to hibernate when they
[1:00:00] go to uh to to migrate
[1:00:04] at a particular season that there's an
[1:00:06] instinct in the leadership
[1:00:08] education wouldn't be the instrument to
[1:00:10] lead them to god's provided plays
[1:00:12] the instrument they have is instinct
[1:00:14] them ducks
[1:00:15] know that the instinct will take them to
[1:00:17] god's provided place
[1:00:20] so does the holy spirit take the church
[1:00:22] to god's provided place
[1:00:25] now the reason why this quote
[1:00:28] struck me to be used here
[1:00:31] is to challenge the idea that if
[1:00:35] i have portrayed it all in my enthusiasm
[1:00:37] for inviting people to church
[1:00:39] and my enthusiasm for saying that this
[1:00:41] inn is a place that people could come
[1:00:43] to receive healing and salvation if in
[1:00:45] any of that it has gotten out of balance
[1:00:48] to seem that i'm making arizona
[1:00:49] believers church and wherever they
[1:00:51] gather
[1:00:52] and that church something special about
[1:00:55] that place
[1:00:56] about the building or about the about
[1:00:58] the fact that it is a church and make
[1:00:59] church more preeminent than the christ
[1:01:01] that the church serves
[1:01:03] and the christ that the church is
[1:01:04] welcoming and the christ that the church
[1:01:06] is ministering
[1:01:06] this quote helps orient us again to
[1:01:08] realize this is we are not a
[1:01:10] church-centric people
[1:01:11] we are a christ-centered people and it's
[1:01:15] christ that draws us to worship
[1:01:16] it's christ that we're gathering around
[1:01:18] it's christ that has the preeminence
[1:01:21] really honestly seriously if it was just
[1:01:24] about church
[1:01:24] go to any church
[1:01:28] why people think we're crazy when they
[1:01:30] say you drive how far
[1:01:32] go church how many churches did you pass
[1:01:35] on your way to that church
[1:01:36] like are they not all preaching christ
[1:01:38] are they all lifted up he said but no no
[1:01:40] it's not just about church it's a church
[1:01:42] home
[1:01:43] it's a place i belong it's a place where
[1:01:45] christ is welcome and i'm a part of what
[1:01:47] god is doing
[1:01:48] i'm there with a vision and a purpose
[1:01:51] so he says god's instinct will bring
[1:01:53] them to god's provided place he says so
[1:01:55] does the holy church
[1:01:56] hold excuse me the holy spirit take the
[1:01:58] church to god's provided place
[1:01:59] not to join a church but to be filled
[1:02:02] with his presence
[1:02:04] to see his word made manifest vindicated
[1:02:07] that's god's provided way for the church
[1:02:10] always
[1:02:12] so this is this is commissioning us this
[1:02:14] is setting us straight this has given us
[1:02:16] the right kind of purpose and vision
[1:02:18] for the people this is god's provided
[1:02:19] way for the church always for the people
[1:02:21] to bring them to the place that god has
[1:02:24] provided for them
[1:02:25] that's exactly what the church should be
[1:02:27] today
[1:02:29] all right catch it we are not the place
[1:02:33] that god has provided
[1:02:34] to bring them but we are placed
[1:02:37] so that we can bring people to his
[1:02:40] provided place
[1:02:41] which is christ so that's the function
[1:02:44] we have if it was just a matter of
[1:02:45] getting people to church let's just all
[1:02:47] come up with some kind of gimmick
[1:02:48] some kind of giveaway some kind of
[1:02:50] raffle some kind of lottery everybody
[1:02:52] right now look under your seat if you
[1:02:53] have the number seven
[1:02:54] you just got a 700 gift card to
[1:02:56] anthropology
[1:02:57] and we just all finds all sorts of ways
[1:02:58] to get people to want to be there but
[1:03:00] what we do as a church
[1:03:01] is we take people god's provided way for
[1:03:04] the church
[1:03:05] is to bring others to the place that god
[1:03:08] has provided for them
[1:03:09] that's exactly what the church should be
[1:03:11] today the church is responsible for
[1:03:14] lifting up christ
[1:03:15] preaching the word so that others find
[1:03:17] their place
[1:03:19] and if that means god leads them to
[1:03:21] another church we rejoice
[1:03:23] if that means god uses them for his
[1:03:25] glory somewhere else
[1:03:26] we rejoice because this isn't the
[1:03:28] ultimate placing
[1:03:30] it's in christ that we receive our
[1:03:31] ultimate placing
[1:03:33] that's right it is our responsibility
[1:03:38] to bring them to the place that god has
[1:03:39] provided not a pew i believe that christ
[1:03:44] has given us as i said
[1:03:45] christ has given us those two pence
[1:03:47] healing and salvation
[1:03:49] to serve with to minister with
[1:03:53] to lift up christ
[1:03:57] that's the right way for a church to
[1:03:58] grow
[1:04:01] brother branham says in the message
[1:04:02] letting off the pressure i hope that
[1:04:04] that can serve as a balancing
[1:04:06] i don't want to ever get out of balance
[1:04:07] in in expressing this we should go to
[1:04:10] church we have to have a home church
[1:04:12] brother i said it very plainly a few
[1:04:13] places you can't stay at home and be a
[1:04:15] christian
[1:04:18] you just can't so we realize this
[1:04:21] there's something about this that the
[1:04:22] word is sanctioned the word is blessed
[1:04:24] but if you get it out of balance you're
[1:04:26] not going to be the right kind of
[1:04:26] christian
[1:04:28] in the message letting off the pressure
[1:04:30] he says the waves can beat and baffle
[1:04:32] and sickness can come
[1:04:33] death can come anything else but you're
[1:04:35] safe evermore
[1:04:36] christ our refuge god's provided place
[1:04:39] of safety
[1:04:40] i i'm reading this to back up how
[1:04:41] brotherhood says that god's provided way
[1:04:43] for the church
[1:04:44] is to bring them to a place that god has
[1:04:46] provided for them that's exactly what
[1:04:47] the church should be today
[1:04:49] this is the place this is the place
[1:04:51] where we lead this is our per
[1:04:52] our responsibility as a church is to
[1:04:55] bring people to this place of safety
[1:04:57] christ our refuge god's provided place
[1:04:59] of safety christ
[1:05:00] is the only place of safety for those
[1:05:03] who wants to live
[1:05:05] he's the only one that has eternal life
[1:05:07] there's no church
[1:05:08] no denomination no president no king no
[1:05:10] pope no bishop no minister
[1:05:12] nothing can give you safety but jesus
[1:05:15] christ
[1:05:17] therefore we do not have at our disposal
[1:05:20] the threat
[1:05:21] that if you leave here you're going to
[1:05:22] be lost no if you leave
[1:05:24] christ there's your danger
[1:05:28] that's when you're going to lose
[1:05:29] everything
[1:05:32] nothing can give you safety but jesus
[1:05:34] christ he's the only place that can give
[1:05:35] you
[1:05:36] safety and he's god's provided safety oh
[1:05:38] we can provide this and provide that and
[1:05:41] it'll fall
[1:05:42] but when god provides anything it's
[1:05:44] eternal and that's
[1:05:45] god's provided way for our safety in
[1:05:48] christ
[1:05:49] i love it when you're in him when
[1:05:51] troubles come like sickness or worry
[1:05:53] disappointment
[1:05:54] he bore our sorrows with his stripes
[1:05:56] we're healed everything that we have
[1:05:58] needed for the rest of our journey
[1:05:59] is right here in the refuge
[1:06:05] we don't even point to our own healing
[1:06:06] our own salvation what does brother
[1:06:08] branham say it's remarkable when you
[1:06:10] listen to those tapes in the early years
[1:06:11] brother says i'm no healer i can't heal
[1:06:13] you
[1:06:14] and when he begins to talk like that
[1:06:15] some people be like you brought me here
[1:06:17] you told me this guy was a healer
[1:06:18] the reason why i'm here holding this
[1:06:20] pair of cars this guy is a healer he
[1:06:21] said i couldn't do nothing to heal you
[1:06:23] i'm no healer i'm no
[1:06:24] i don't do that and they're like wait a
[1:06:26] minute we're all here because you're the
[1:06:27] healing goes
[1:06:27] no it's christ that heals you i'm just
[1:06:30] to serve and i can just stand here and
[1:06:31] pray for you i can just do what he tells
[1:06:33] me
[1:06:33] i can just stand by the word of god
[1:06:35] right it's letting christ have the
[1:06:37] primes letting the word have the
[1:06:38] preeminence
[1:06:39] and a church doesn't brag that it's got
[1:06:42] what you need to finish the job
[1:06:45] but it realizes that in christ
[1:06:47] everything that we have needed for the
[1:06:49] rest of the journey
[1:06:50] is right here in the refuge and when the
[1:06:52] churches welcome christ the refuge into
[1:06:54] its midst
[1:06:55] it can say we know the one who can carry
[1:06:58] you who can heal you who can strengthen
[1:07:00] you
[1:07:00] who can encourage you who has what you
[1:07:02] need
[1:07:07] i want to close with this statement this
[1:07:09] statement is just so challenging to me
[1:07:17] he says god
[1:07:20] let us take the opportunity while it's
[1:07:22] presented to us
[1:07:24] they are depending on us they left their
[1:07:27] word the word of god that was shown to
[1:07:29] them and it brings to mind
[1:07:31] that they without us could not be made
[1:07:32] perfect in this procession of believers
[1:07:35] through centuries
[1:07:37] and how they did their part and when
[1:07:38] they died they passed the baton of the
[1:07:40] word of god but then he says they're
[1:07:42] depending on us to carry it out
[1:07:46] you're running the last leg you're going
[1:07:49] to be the ones that cross the finish
[1:07:50] line
[1:07:51] he says jesus come to confirm it and to
[1:07:53] send the holy spirit to continue the
[1:07:55] work and to give us power to work by
[1:07:57] till these things be all finished
[1:08:00] and then the great ransom church of the
[1:08:02] living god be caught up
[1:08:04] to meet him there are some here today
[1:08:08] listen to his prayer
[1:08:10] oh god may it just become something that
[1:08:12] we can
[1:08:14] be captivated by
[1:08:17] listen to the prayer of this prophet
[1:08:20] there are some here today father
[1:08:21] who do not have this blessed restful
[1:08:23] hope in their souls
[1:08:26] may this be the day that they will
[1:08:28] receive it
[1:08:31] he says there may be those here who've
[1:08:34] grown weary in the way
[1:08:36] let them know lord that we never come to
[1:08:38] a picnic
[1:08:39] but to a battleground you fight every
[1:08:41] inch of the way
[1:08:42] he says give them courage strengthen
[1:08:45] them
[1:08:45] amen well i think we've already pointed
[1:08:48] it out here before
[1:08:49] it wouldn't just smack them upside the
[1:08:50] head you know better than that
[1:08:52] you know pull yourself up by your
[1:08:53] bootstraps buddy you didn't
[1:08:56] this is what you think this message was
[1:08:57] a picnic no it's empathizing
[1:08:59] right but think about those that have
[1:09:01] been grown weary in the way give them
[1:09:03] courage strengthen them

[1:09:40] wounded sheep all over here they are
[1:09:42] lame
[1:09:43] wounded and they would be gupping going

[1:09:47] but they must be taken to the end
[1:09:50] where the caretaker is to take care

[1:11:01] have as a church
[1:11:03] and say lord we in welcome you
[1:11:07] we invite you let's stand to our feet
[1:11:10] tonight
[1:11:14] sister cassandra if you'd come you could

[1:11:20] actually i think i see it sing in the
[1:11:21] key of f turn your eyes upon jesus
[1:11:45] can we do a little
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:48] self-examination tonight
[1:11:54] i i'm not going to apologize but i will
[1:11:57] at least acknowledge that
[1:11:59] it might not have been as festive as
[1:12:01] some of us wanted
[1:12:03] and that when the jingle bells and the
[1:12:07] balls of holly and maybe we thought we'd
[1:12:10] all just gather around tonight with our
[1:12:12] hot cocoa and some marshmallows and
[1:12:14] talk about the birth of christ and i
[1:12:17] even realized
[1:12:18] the way that i could try to characterize
[1:12:19] it that this was really hard and cutting
[1:12:21] but i will say this
[1:12:23] i know it is challenging but i sense
[1:12:26] it's something you welcome
[1:12:29] that there's actually a joy that's
[1:12:31] quickened within your heart to be
[1:12:32] challenged in this way
[1:12:33] because you're up for it i believe
[1:12:36] you're up for it
[1:12:37] and i believe you're capable of being
[1:12:40] the bearers of christ's presence
[1:12:42] so let us as we pray let us ponder
[1:12:46] as we bow our heads even now as i like
[1:12:48] to go to the lord in prayer

[1:13:15] to not be turned off to not be
[1:13:19] uh i have the wrong kind of reaction

[1:13:28] vessel lord here i
[1:13:30] am use me for your glory lord strip away
