TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh this um thought that we just want to use a man tonight the attribute of Salvation we will just kind of use a number of scriptures to kind of prove our thought but let me start with a couple quotes here that brother Branham amen gives us when and one we why are we not a denomination it says uh which was first a savior or a sinner says which was first a savior which was first A Healer or a sick person it says why was there permitted to be a scare if there never been a sinner he'd never been known as a savior says hallelujah he can make all things wind around to his glory can the Potter say or the pot say to the Potter you made me thus who's on the wheel who's got the claim whose hands is it in Paul said a foolish man didn't he say he raised Pharaoh up for the very purpose certainly he knew it before there was a world he knowed who would be what and he let there be sin that he might be a savior he let there be sickness that he might be a Healer he let there be hate that he might be love sure he did he's God and that's his attributes and he has to have something to display his attributes how would you ever know there was a night how would you uh no ever know there's any if if it was all daylight how would you ever know there was a night there's a night so it could prove daylight sure there is amen you see what he did so you know the prophet just makes it very clear here uh before there was a sinner there had to be a savior amen and and and the other thing here is that uh uh in order for him to display this attribute of Salvation amen somebody had to be lost glory to God uh all of us can say that we were in that place where we were lost at one time but that attribute was expressed to us that's why we're here tonight amen the attribute of Salvation is why we're here tonight now I want to just kind of mention something here because uh I'm gonna show you just in Scripture that all through the Old Testament this attribute of Salvation was actually being demonstrated amen and sometimes you may not realize it but even in your own life this attribute is expressed hallelujah amen and I there's a little thought that I remember the prophet saying all that God was amen he poured into Christ and all that Christ is every attribute that is in Christ he is pouring that into his church Hallelujah I wrote this if a lion gives birth then you expect another lion to be born amen if a zebra gives birth then you expect another zebra to be born amen if a dog gives birth then you expect another dog to be born praise God if a human gives birth then you expect another human to be born but if God gives birth glory to God we expect another God to be born blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen amen here the prophet says God gave Jesus his Spirit without measure in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily he was God manifested In the Flesh the Bible said that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself but when he gave out his Spirit to we adopted Sons he gave us a bucket full out of the ocean and he had all the fullness of the godhead we just have a portion of it as a gift of the Holy Spirit but I I but if I took one bucket full of water out of the ocean or even a tea a teaspoon full of it out of the ocean the same chemicals that's in the entire ocean would be in that Spoonful but just less in quantity not less in quality amen but less in quantity so the same holy spirit that was in Christ Grace is also in his church every attribute that was in God amen it was poured into Christ in every attribute that was in Christ is being poured into the church hallelujah amen I love uh this scripture that we read in Luke 2 verse 11 it says For unto us unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior amen which is Christ the lord and when we just look at the definition of that word savior it is a preserver a Defender a man or deliverer amen savior could be a man a preserver a defender or a deliverer amen amen let's go a little further uh with our our topic tonight just keep that in mind a savior could be a preserver a defender or deliverer here in that mess in the message that day on Calvary brother random makes a statement here he says and When sin struck the Earth back in the beginning like a sheet of Blackness falling from the heaven it literally paralyzed the Earth it thrown every creature on the earth and all of God's creation in bondage man was under bondage of death sickness troubles Sorrows all nature fell with it sin was an anesthetic that actually paralyzed the Earth and then we sat here hopeless amen because every creature on Earth was subject to it and everyone born on Earth was subject to it so it had to come from some place where there was no sin amen it could not come from the earth and I love that statement amen the the remedy had to come from some place where there was no sin I want to tell you that you have come from a place where there was no sin you have come from a place where there was no sickness you have come from a place where there were no hospitals you have come from a place where there were no graveyards amen you have come from a place where there was no sin and that's why we longed to go back to that place that we've come from Hallelujah we know it exists because we came from there blessed be the name of the Lord amen it says one of us could not redeem the other it had to come from another therefore when man realized that he was separated from from his God he become a Wanderer they wept they cried they toil they wandered about through the mountains and through the desert seeking a city whose Builder and maker was God for he knew that if he ever got back in the presence of God he could talk it over with him but there was no way back he become lost he didn't know which way to turn so he just took out wandering trying to find somewhere that he could find a way back to that place something on the inside of him told him that he'd come from a place that was perfect amen you know and we realized this was the very reason because of what happened in the Garden of Eating the sin that struck amen it paralyzed us amen but the but but the very reason of us needing Christ is because he was the way back to that place where there's no more sin that place where there is no sickness he was the way back we have to go through Christ to get back into that place we thank God for the Savior that was born brother Branham made this statement uh a man could not save himself so therefore we needed a savior man could not redeem himself therefore we needed a redeemer and and I want to put this God begin to tell the story of Salvation and Redemption through various characters in the scripture now let's just pick up a man this first character Joshua a man in Joshua 10 and 6 will see amen uh just something that happened here and and Joshua's uh a life now I will just take a quick um just to just kind of a quick quick recap of his story Joshua was there uh um the the father he he followed Moses Ministry but then he got raised up Amen to be the next leader and it was established that he would be the leader I thank God for that I love that I love when Ministries a man can uh have good succession plans I like that and and unfortunately I think there's a lot of Ministries that miss this but uh but Joshua's established as the leader before Moses went off to sing that way it didn't leave any confusion and even the people said you know what we'll stand behind you Joshua if we see the same God moving in your ministry that was moving in in Moses ministry will stand right behind you they would support him so we thank God for that but but Joshua amen had a a great responsibility not only lead the people of brother but brother brother random said he had to divide the land accordingly amen and uh and Joshua's there dividing the land and and God had told them to not make any agreements with any of the people in the land well Joshua got ahead of himself and he let some people trick him into an agreement the gibeonax I believe it was they tricked him into an agreement well while uh while when they signed the agreement Joshua provided them protection and here in this scripture we'll see that they are they had some some other enemies coming against them and what they did did is they reached out to Joshua a man for there to be their deliverer they reached out to Joshua amen and they asked him to be their Savior and Joshua actually means Jehovah Savior and here in Joshua 10 66 and the men of gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to gilgolf saying slap not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and look at that and save us so they're asking Joshua to be their Savior and his name actually means Jehovah savior amen and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains that gather together against us now amen I don't want to just leave that there for Joshua you know even in your own personal life when certain family members are or friends or even co-workers get into certain situations maybe at times am I they might look at you as the Holy Roller amen and other times they look at you as the you know the the you know the Christian amen amongst everybody amen you're the light in the midst of the darkness but when they get into trouble they know exactly who to call right Hallelujah I want you to notice they don't even call amen they don't go to God themselves but the way that they reach God is through you because the attribute is flowing through you oh blessed be the name of the Lord this is exactly what the gibeonax did amen they approached Joshua and said please save us here's this attribute being expressed through the ministry of Joshua let's go on a little further brother Brandon makes a statement Amen in this message the way of a true prophet of God it says and then I get I gave the illustration of how the Israel and the march to the promised land they had never seen that land they know nothing about it they just had a promise of of God there was a land and it was full of milk and honey and good and a great place they never had seen it nobody had ever been there or know anything about it but they had a problem they had the promise of it and by faith they so jormed through the desert and when they got right to the borderline they had a warrior there by the name of Joshua which means Jehovah's savior so he crossed over to Jordan into the promised land and brought back the evidence that the land was there I like that and it was a good Land Two Men packed one bunch of grapes it was a good land so he brought back the evidence that the land that they were going to possess was there now to the church we are journeying to a land of immortality a land where there's no death amen a land where the dance raised up we had we had a great Savior and I can't Jesus means Jehovah savior beloved and he crossed the Jordan of death over into the other land and come back and brought the evidence that we live after death amen so where is death at I love I love the way the prophet put that he says this Joshua uh which meant Jehovah uh savior amen was the perfect type of Christ he crossed Jordan and brought brought back a good report that the land was flowing with milk and honey amen Jordan also represents a spiritual death Jesus went across Jordan which he he went across death amen and rose again after the third day and he proved that the lamb was good on the other side of death Jesus proved that the land was good on the other side of death for the believer it's an eternal land where we never get sick and we never have to die again amen it is a land flown with milk and honey praise God we thank God for proof we have nothing to worry about blessed be the name of the Lord this story of redemption continues to be uh told or the story of Salvation Redemption it continued to be told through various characters in Scripture now you know when I was uh reading this scripture out of Nehemiah 9 I want to read that Nehemiah 9 and verse 24. I read this in my my Bible reading and and my it just it just blessed me it actually it it's the one that inspired me to preach this sermon look at what the Bible says in Nehemiah 9 verse 24-27 says so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subdue us before them the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites and gave us them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land that they might do with them as they would and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed Houses full of goods Wells digged Vineyards and Olive yards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocations in verse 27 I like this therefore thou deliverest them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them and and and uh and uh in the time of their trouble when they Cried unto thee thou heard a stem from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviors now who saved them out of their out of the hand of their enemies and I just like the way that that reads it says you gave them he gave them saviors not just one right we know Christ is the ultimate savior but this attribute is being expressed amen through different characters of the scripture and he even said it in Nehemiah he gave them saviors this is a title that he gave them oh my my my my right so so again now when we look at uh just that word I went to the Hebrew lexicon where it says Thou gave us some saviors I just looked at that and it's the word uh Yasha uh uh but it's it means to be saved to be delivered to be liberated a man to be victorious right to save from moral troubles to give Victory to and there's a number of scriptures that that it refers to in the Greek Lexicon I just wanted to pick up a couple of them and share them with you glory to God one of them is Exodus 2 verse 17. amen and what is going on here in Exodus 2 is is Moses um amen is is driven out glory to God and and uh and and here he comes I believe there was a time here where he comes and he's helping somebody uh water that their their um their their flock right and when he comes in to help this word help is actually he came in to be a savior glory to God you all remember amen there I think it was Jethro's daughters they were going through all kind of things with the with the other Shepherds and Moses stood up for on their behalf he became a savior oh my amen when he stood up on their behalf that attribute was actually expressed through Moses oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ is he is pouring that into the church these attributes are now being expressed to us here in Exodus 2 17 the Shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up and helped them amen and watered their flocks so when he when he when he helped him he actually became the deliverer amen he actually became the Savior and he might not have realized but this attribute of Deliverance was going to flow all the way back down into Egypt because one day he was going to get a call on the backside of the desert that he had to return to Egypt and guess what he would have to be a savior to his people amen there in Egypt oh blessed be the name of the Lord also Exodus 14. amen verse 30. it says this thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the Seesaw so when God delivereth them amen and they saw the Egyptians drowning there in in the Red Sea they realized that God had become a savior to them this attribute of Salvation was being manifested blessed be the name of the Lord here's a another one a man that we can pick up actually I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to move just to another quote here brother Brandon makes this statement out of the message the faith of Abraham it says when you're saved God gives you a checkbook at the bottom of it it's got Jesus name sign on every check any Redemptive blessing belongs to you are you afraid to fill it out and Abraham's children are you afraid he won't recognize the name of Jesus whatever you ask the father in my name that I will do that's the promise you're Abraham's children you're not afraid to fill it out the right hand the right hand of God making intercessions for that's what he died for and it goes on says now Abraham sure he was Heir then after a while a lot got in trouble now we'll close an amendment and in a minute lot got in trouble and you always get in trouble when you backslot all right we wish we have time to dwell on that but he got in trouble what happened the enemy come and packed him off now brother Brandon makes a statement it is now Abraham played the part of the Savior again when light got in trouble the prophet says Abraham so this attribute was being expressed through Abraham when Abraham went out at the lot he had nothing to go with he had no Army to go with amen he had he had just a few tools in the shed that he could use Amen to go after five Kings my God but see it didn't matter because God was with him as he was going after those kings and brother Branham say Abraham Hallelujah played the part of the Savior again and I want to say this as Abraham is playing the part of a savior amen if ever that attribute has been expressed a savior has to be willing to give his life a savior has to be willing to die for the other person that they're saying uh you just can't be a hero just to be a hero you got to be willing to go through something to be a hero Hallelujah Gloria he says Abraham played the part of the Savior again he gassed himself and went after the enemy that took away his poor backslidden corrupted brother that's what Jesus did sickness bound you sin bound you poor backslip and corrupted and Jesus came in and went after you and he brought lot back Abraham did not only did he bring a lot back but Christ brought us back he was willing to go after us but this attribute has been expressed through these various characters remember he gave unto them Israel he gave them to them saviors saviors brother Branham just clearly told us that Abraham was a was what played the part of Savior and and here I like this lot was overtaken and captured and if lot could have saved himself he would have see a savior the reason that um lot needed a savings because he was so bound and amen he was he was he was captured there was nothing he could do for himself he had to realize he needed a savior and we're the same way amen sin has kept us in bondage and and sickness and all this we needed a savior glory to God Amen I said I wrote this note had he been strong enough or the city that he was in had they been strong enough they would have defeated the opposing armies themselves but lot needed someone greater than him to bring deliverance and we need someone greater than us to bring Deliverance hallelujah amen he had a relative I love this he had a relative that was willing to do whatever it took to bring Salvation Abraham would not leave his backslidden brother in that condition I'll do whatever I got to do to go get my brother out of that brother Branham say Abraham played the part of Savior Jesus left his throne in glory to come and bring the Redemption story to us whatever it took he was willing to do even give his life on a cross whatever it took he was willing to do in order to bring Salvation to us look we can look back at many of the judges and see delivers like othenil we can see ehut right I mean these these people are willing to do all some some really tough things Amen in their days sham God what about shamgar right I mean uh that all he has is an ox goat he has nothing to really fight with but just an ox go and he's willing to go against 600 men right I mean a savior is willing to sacrifice their life there was Barack there was Gideon amen there was jephthah there were Sampson all of these are different different ones that God sent amen there to Israel and and I was just thinking to myself you know when when uh the children of Israel were were in bondage by uh the the uh Philistines Hallelujah and Goliath is making his big boasts about you know just don't don't don't let everybody die just send one man out here and and uh and that one man if he dies then we'll serve you and and and if uh if if if he kills me then we'll sir we'll serve you and if if I kill him then you all serve us and you know he's got his great boasts Hallelujah and everybody Amen in the Army when they seek Goliath come out to the the middle of the battlefield they take off running the other way even Saul even Saul takes off running but David happened to be coming just to bring some food to his brothers and he sees he sees uh Goliath come out and and and and and and listen let me tell you something amen a savior praise God is not trying to promote themselves in that way I realize what is happening when they enter into that attribute I hope you understand amen with Christ he knew exactly what he's doing but when this attribute begins to be manifested through us we don't realize what's happening Hallelujah David just happened to show up one day amen and he sees this this challenge go forth and he began to ask questions and his brother's like hey you need to stop asking questions you know get get back to taking care of the sheep and and do this and do that and just leave the battle to us and say well you guys are running you know you guys are running don't seem like nobody's fighting says you know I wouldn't mind fighting this fella he said I could I can't stand and hear him make these claims against amen the god that we serve we stand on promises we're God's chosen people let me go out against him he said no get out of here David go back to Dad go back to home he's like no I'm willing to go out and fight for my country David was willing to give his life because this attribute was actually being expressed through him he went to Saul and says look you know I would love to go out and fight him says well now you young man is no need for you to go out there and do that this man's been fighting since his Youth and you just young man no way he says you know what I killed a bear one time you he said well that's pretty good young man and say well you know not only that I killed a lion too like you did what says like I tell you what you got enough courage why don't you go and go out and fight this guy but before you go just take my armor with you and I like to ask this question if Saul has so much confidence in the armor why didn't he use it himself why didn't he use it himself oh my I can tell you right now it was not in him right to be savior I'm gonna take another thing another secret about David David was the only man in the army of Israel that could go out and fight Goliath and not die if he would have died God would have had to resurrect him again the reason being because David was the only man to have the pre he was the pre-anointed king and he had not yet come into His Place so he had to be protected on the battlefield you ain't going nowhere until God is finished with you nothing to fear nothing to fear you're going nowhere until God is finished but when David went out there to the battlefield and took life down with one stone the attribute of Salvation yes was being expressed through this act of taking out Goliath see this attribute has just been going on throughout these different characters I I love I love another one here that I wanna I wanna bring up uh Joseph was sold into slavery Joseph uh thrown into a pits sold into slavery lied on by his brothers and we know he was his life was a perfect type of Christ right he when he when he went to prison uh lied on by a pot of his wife when he went to prison had the Butler and the baker there interpreted their dreams and you know and was spot on with the interpretation right and uh we we all know the story and and it was a type because the butler amen was uh was raised back to his position but the the baker went on to his reward right but but here you know when Jesus Down the Cross there was two thieves on the cross and and once they remember me when you're coming to your kingdom and this day you'll be with me in Paradise the other one was lost right we we know all the types there but but I love the words that Joseph used because uh Joseph amen as he went through all these things and sometimes Hallelujah when this attribute is being expressed to us there's many things we have to go through that we don't enjoy things that we we really we rather tell God I rather not have that trial Hallelujah I'm reminded of a little story and I'll get back here to Joseph in a second but I'm reminded of a little story of that I heard about uh a man that was complaining about having to carry a cross you know everyone has a take up a cross and follow Christ and this man was carrying his cross and he got to complaining he's like Lord this cross is just too heavy I just can't carry it anymore and just kept saying lord it's too heavy for me to carry too much for me to carry so the Lord said okay I'll tell you what you don't have to carry that cross but you do have to carry a cross he says so what I'm going to do is I'm going to let you come in this door and drop that cross and then I'm going to have you go out the door and through another door and you have to find a cross in that room to carry so he says okay Lord that's a great deal he went in the carried his cross dropped it off walked out that door and walked walked into another one and he started looking around saying oh that's a huge cross I wouldn't want to carry that oh my who would have to carry oh look at all of this no way he said then he saw a real small cross in a little corner and he went running to that little cross and said Lord I'll carry this one right here I'll carry they got the little cross picked it up walked out I'll carry this one and the Lord told him said that's the same cross you just put down yeah so you're gonna have to carry something and as you're carry you don't realize the character of Christ is being formed in you so count it all joy my friends whatever it is that you're going through count it all joy God knows exactly what he's doing in your life Joseph Joseph had to learn to count things Joy No Matter What had happened he knew God God allowed these things happen and it's only after trouble hit the land of Egypt that he was raised out of prison and called them the the butler remember say hey this guy can interpret your dream Pharaoh he did it for me and I forgot please forgive me but this guy can get us out of this and as Joseph come out to prison amen interpret the Pharaoh what was going on Pharaoh Pharaoh looked and says you know is there anybody in our kingdom that got more wisdom than this man right here because if there's nobody that gots the wisdom that he has I'm not letting him go back to prison no one stood up Joseph got promoted went from prison to vice president Joseph brother brothers eventually came and I love it you know because uh I I heard something today Joseph didn't actually reveal himself to his brothers until their second coming and Christ won't reveal himself to the Jews until the second coming right so so here Joseph A Man reveals himself to his brothers and something happens here in Genesis 50 their father passes away and I'm just kind of rushing through all of these things but their father passes away and the brothers assume that Joseph is now going to get them for what they did to him in the past but in Genesis 50 verse 17. they say so shall ye say unto Joseph I pray thee now the trespass of thy Brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the Servants of the god of thy father and Joseph wept when they spake unto him and his Brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants look at this and Joseph said unto them fear not for am I in the place of God but as for you do you thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive this attribute of Salvation was being manifested in the life of Joseph but he had to go through so much before this attribute could be expressed he had no idea why God was taking him through all those things it was so the attribute could be manifested in his life oh my God now therefore fee not I will nourish you and your little ones and he confident in them and speak kindly unto them now I'm gonna just give a couple other people here oh my I used some some men in scripture what about a few women where this attribute is expressed through these women I got one for you just ran out of the gate amen and and I'll give you uh maybe we can pull this up in scripture too we'll read this one but this one this was a prophet that forgot to do a very important thing that God told him to do he forgot to actually circumcise his voice and the Bible says that the angel of the Lord went seeking after Moses to kill him but to know who his savior was his wife had his wife not taking the foreskin off of us and she she cut the foreskin off threw it down on the ground said you're a bloody man to me but because of her action it stopped the angel from slaying Moses his wife became a savior can I give you another one let's talk about Esther Esther a man was there in in the in in in in the palace and I love this I love the story of Esther you know uh she was she went through some hard things she lost both of her parents amen and losing her parents it really caused us to go probably go through a lot of things I like to say she was raised by a very strict Uncle Mordecai he wouldn't let her go out to the parties he wouldn't let her go here wouldn't let her go there you got to keep yourself asked to wait for God to send you a husband I mean all kind of things like this that she's going through with her Uncle Hallelujah but did not realize that she needed to go through that in order to be considered one of the women that the king might choose because he was only looking for virgins so here he goes amen uh here here uh here here you know vashti decides that she's not gonna go Amen to the king's banquet she's not she's going to have her own banquet my God she was a rough one Hallelujah but the king says you know what we have no more Bastion we won't have her we'll just find another queen well they choose Esther but I like it because as Esther's going through this outside the kingdom there's a edict going that they're going to kill all the Jews and she was told don't share who you are don't tell them who you are don't say anything now is the time for her to reveal her true identity when the pressure was on and I love it because she was she was she like look I'm in the Kingdom now and I'm not going to tell them I'm a Jew I got here this far by not saying it I'm not gonna say it now Mordecai say look don't don't think because you're in the Kingdom don't think that that you're gonna you you you uh you're not going to be a part of this don't think that once he finds out he gonna kill you too he says how do you know you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this Mr might have thought her greatest role was to be Queen yeah that's good Esther found out when she revealed Mordecai's plan because understand in the Kingdom there was only two people higher than Mordecai one was the king and the other was Queen Esther and when she when he got invited to the banquet Esther could call for him to come to the banquet as to had all kind of power and authority and when he got invited Esther begin to reveal the plan and then and and he realized my God The Gallows that he built for somebody else he was going to hang from himself Esther stepped in on behalf of her people after that three-day fast she went from just being Queen God's idea God's thoughts of Esther was higher than Queen because Esther was the only one in the Kingdom that could act as Savior What a Mighty God there's another character here and that I want to I want to bring in and rehab Rahab let the spies come into her home and and you know maybe they thought that this was some new customers but Rahab no no no no I'm not I'm not I'm not having you over for that I need to talk to you about something because you know we heard that you all did this you know did that and this whole city is scared of what's getting ready to happen here all I'm asking is for protection and and here's here's the beautiful thing that I want I want to I want to make sure we get Rahab did not only ask for protection for herself savior's not just thinking about themselves amen but Rahab began to ask for her parents I mean anybody and they say look if you get your mama you get your daddy you get your brother you get your sister if you get them in the house this Scarlet threat that we told you to put out we're gonna have this house protected and I love it because when the walls came down her house was actually built on top of the wall so every piece of the Wall came down except where rehab's house was I wanna I wanna I wanna I wanna inject this I just want to inject a little quote here in God's rap gift brother Bram says Rahab the Harlot that we're all familiar with being a young girl that was turned on the street by a heathen father and mother now think about that rehab was turned on the street by her father and her mother thinking now back then we know you know women might not have been the value you know that maybe the the value that father had for his daughter might not have been there but for a mother to push her daughter out into a lifestyle like this it just it just grips my heart how could a mother agree to do this How could a mother I mean a father shouldn't do it either right but how could a father and a mother come that we're going to turn our daughter out in order to bring food here into our house look at what brother Brown said young girl that was turned on the street by a heathen father mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and was to bring an income to them on prostitution and yet down in this immoral girl that was turned on the street she had heard that there was a God who answered prayer and the first opportunity she got to accept that God or do something for him she did it and God spared her life and saved the father and mother and a family she fell in love with a general in the army of Israel we found in history and married this General and their courtship was wonderful and finally it settled down and lived at Bethlehem and we know Christ came through that lineage but here's the thing that really just troubled me that her father and mother would agree to sell her for income now if there was any person that needed to have a complex with their parents if there was any person that would be justified to have a complex amen with their parents Rahab is that person but rather than take on a complex when it came time for deliverance oh Hallelujah she's asking for the same man that sold her out there put her out there in prostitution the same Mama that put in process can I can my mama be safe can my daddy be said Can my brothers can my son can anybody be safe as long as you get them into the house rehab have the attribute a prostitute has the attribute of salvation being manifested in her life when I thought about rehab I said oh my my my my my what about our Lord and our savior who went to a cross when everybody rejected him but yet he was willing to go to the Cross no matter what they said about him he was still willing to go to the Cross uh Savers got to be willing to give their all this attribute being expressed you know I was uh thinking when I was a young young young lad roughly four or five years old I had a little situation in my life where I had some cousins and they were babysitting me and and they went to a pool one day and and they went to swim and they really couldn't swim so they stayed in the shallow parts of the water where they could stand above the water well I was too young to get into the pool so I was just playing around the pool and and I would take a rock and throw it in a rock and and and and lift it out and I just kept doing that just moving around the perimeter of the pool and I got down to the deep end and I threw that rock in and went to lift it out and when I went to lift it out I let it go in a little bit too deep and I fell into the water and when I fell into the water uh I don't remember anything else but what they told me or I could the part that I do remember is waking up in the lap of a fireman well they told me what had happened is that there was a a a a uh a lifeguard that she wasn't on duty that day and she happened to be skating by the pool at the time that I fell in so she took off one skate and she couldn't get the other skate off and she jumped inside the pool to get me out of the deep end and when she got me out they called all the authorities and police came the firemen came and they even had a helicopter there to think they were gonna you know Fly Me Away somewhere and and while I mean all these people are gathered and I'm I'm just out you know and um and I don't know what they did but all of a sudden my eyes just popped open and I'm looking at the firemen I'm like what is going on what what this what just happened here and uh and and and and when they told me what had happened that this this young lady with the one skate just happened to jump in and get me out do you realize what happened that day that lady became a savior to me I don't even know her name I don't know where she lived I I mean I don't know I I don't know anything about it I've never seen her since that day but on that day she became a savior to me not to myself thank God for her saving me I wouldn't be standing here today but you know what I needed something greater than her I needed a savior greater than her you want to know why I needed to save your greater than her because I was sinking deep in far from the peaceful Shore very deeply staying within I was sinking to rise no more but the master of the sea heard my despairing cry and from the waters he Lifted Me now safe am I see we thank God for what men have been able to do for us through uh through our life but God we needed Christ more than we needed men because man could not redeem us man could not put us back in that place or even give us the the route to get back to that place where there is no more sin there is no more sickness there is no more disease there is nothing that we have to fear nothing we have to work no more graveyards only Christ could put us on the path to get us back to that place we thank God for him being our savior brother random makes this statement in smyrnian church age oh how striking it is Jehovah born crying over a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw there's your Everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved their own Theology and denied the truth of god Jehovah God a crying baby in a stinking Barn then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our nose is criticizing and and acting as though we were somebody here's your real sign this is the right one Jehovah playing as a boy Jehovah working in a carpenter shop Jehovah washing the feet of fishermen I will give you a sign said God not the sign of a white collared priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you'll want or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow spit on his face mocked and said it not Jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while the Hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross Jehovah dying look at this Jehovah praying and nothing happening Jehovah praying and nothing happening and we get discouraged when we pray and nothing happens well Jehovah also prayed and nothing happened then Jehovah died that is a sign for all men now there isn't another like it it is the great one then Darkness Came Upon the Earth they put him in a tomb those three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the Gloom of the night and it came forth Jehovah came forth Jehovah ascended on high then Jehovah returned to indwell his church Jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and Empower his people once more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and again Jehovah heals the sick how does he do it now it's through his people he raises the dead and manifests himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving an answer back in interpretation Jehovah came down and he raised the prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with fly blows on his face as he lay unconscious in the gutter yes Jehovah came to manifest in flesh watch this watch this manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah came God in us the hope of glory God bless you God bless you let's have a word of Prayer father we are grateful for your word Lord is uh
