TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on the subject of Christ my healer we're going to touch on um we still kind of laying the foundation in this and haven't maybe got as far as we would like to get um in this subject matter but today we want to just take a step further this is part four of Christ my healer and we're looking specifically at the promise of Divine Healing as it says here they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover just as much as you couldn't take out back baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ out of the scripture you cannot take Divine Healing out of the scripture and so I really desire that we could be rooted and grounded in this absolute promise of God to heal it is God's promise recognize it place it scripturally and we haven't even got to that point yet to where we can really start digging into uh the mechanics of Divine Healing and God's promise to heal and the different ways that it's used in the scripture and represented uh and and so ultimately you'd even want to look at how to receive Divine Healing how to have your faith positioned to receive it but we're focusing more right now on its purpose what's the purpose of Divine Healing and so today I recognize at the outset so if at some point you're like man brother Aaron's just repeated himself I realize that and so maybe that's all it takes is for me to notice or know that I'm repeating myself to make it feel better for you but I know I'll be repeating scriptures different quotations and REO going back over several things that we've already looked at but I want to further establish what God God's original way of receiving any Redemptive blessing and receiving Divine Healing the original way and then as my subtitle indicates I want to identify a Tipping Point and and a Tipping Point both in a good way but a bad way there's a point at which maybe and I'm not necessarily using it in this sense but there's a point at which you could come to spot and says well it could go either way and and go either way catastrophically in one way and the best thing ever the other way and we're almost wanting to hone in on this idea that at some point um it can tip both in a good way and a bad way and so there uh as we as we're thinking about these things there's a purpose to Divine Healing we could say well it seems pretty plain to me brother Aon if I'm sick and someone lays hands on me and prays for me I get well that's that's got to be the purpose right so I can go without a headache for a few days or so that I can be delivered from this cold or whatever it might be that's got to be the purpose for it but there's more to Divine Healing than just the actual remedy to what was ailing you even in one place and I know that we've read this before where brother bradam says you want to be healed he says what's the reason you want to be healed for and he's actually to kind of stir up someone's faith and get them to think about well I want to be healed and I'm desperate to be healed but what's your motive and objective what's the purpose and the reason and so there there's enough to it to where God brother Bram is actually identifying there's a promise and there's a need but why because it has to has to meet some purpose we want to be able to place healing within God's plan and this will this kind of just sums it up for me in in a lot of ways at the outset that the purpose of Divine Healing or the purpose of physical healing is to point to the truth and reality of full Redemption that whenever whenever we are healed physically it is a it is another uh Stone to the foundation there's another deposit of the earnest it's another reminder of the truth of full Redemption not that we could live um 180 years and every time we had strep throat get healed immediately and then just die and never to live again but that anytime that we're healed it speaks of a resurrection it speaks of an eternal day and So Divine Healing is a sign that the price has been paid as you turn to Isaiah chapter 53 it's a sign that a price has been paid it's not just for temporary healing but it's a it indicates permanent Redemption because we recognize that um we can get sick and be healed only to get sick again I don't want anybody here to have a negative testimony but anyone ever been healed amen and how many have been sick again just as many hands would go up and say yep maybe something else but we get sick again it's just the nature of life but in Isaiah chapter maybe not a but there but and in Isaiah chapter 53:5 it says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed to us this scripture does not resonate in an unfamiliar way we don't read it Like H what does this even mean but truly to a Jew at the time that this prophecy is uttered um there would be elements that they would hearken back to the the symbolisms of the sacrifice there'd be certain things about the language that's being used where they would understand atonement and sacrifice and the shedding of blood but yet it's pointing to one who would actually be a savior and that in his wounding it would remedy transgressions in his bruising it would take care of iniquities that in his chastising it would be for our peace and our Accord and for the satisfaction of God's Wrath and that with his stripes him being beaten him being striped that we would be healed he says we are healed by his stripes so now looking back the scripture doesn't seem to be very alien to us because we recognize this in Jesus Christ and then to us we could say it's already an absolute promise it's already settled by the work of Calvary we are healed amen and as we've ID as we kind of Taken time just to make reference to this when he shed his blood it was for the Redemption of the soul but that price was so great it included the healing of your body and so the price of redemption paid for our healing and the atonement for sin is the same it includes physical healing brother Braham said take Divine Healing away from Christ you cut half the atonement into two so think of that if you were to if you were to take the message of the hour take the Bible and preach against Divine Healing you're cutting Christ in two any way try to skew it to say that there's no there's no uh uh power of God to heal there's no power of God to raise up and you try to take these things out of the word of God you're actually diminishing the power of the atonement and remember that there's a point at which you can diminish the power of the atonement remember I makes some Curious statements in this regard but I'll just make reference to a couple of he says now some of the Full Gospel people turned firmly against Divine Healing believe that it wasn't even in the atonement I know that doesn't seem quite right to us maybe we don't come into contact with a lot of people who believe the word of God who would be against Divine Healing be saying Full Gospel people have turned against Divine Healing and found a way to to wiggle it out of the atonement found a way to say ah well it's not in the atonement that's where you hear of the dispensationalist who say the days of Miracles are passed or that was only for the apostles there's a lot of very very rich Theology and academic study and and a lot of commentaries to establish that there were certain things given to the apostles in the days of after the days of Christ and the setting up of the church and that they did these things alone and no one else is to do them and there's this idea that exist when it comes to these things specifically with reference to Divine Healing brother bam said the devil fights this wonderful truth of Divine Healing and marks it up and so because the devil fights against it and marks it up that's the reason why it's good for us to take time to look at the promise of God because the devil is always fighting the wonderful truth of it in trying to mark it up we've read a lot from Psalms 107:20 want this to be kind of a Cornerstone to us he sent his word and healed them and de delivered them from their destructions how did he heal them by sending his word God's word is so powerful he sent his command at his command the broken are mended at his command the sick are made well it's exactly what the scripture saying he sent his word and the word being sent by his command something that's broken is fixed something that sick has made well and in the ministry of Jesus Christ the power of God or the power of the word was demonstrated quite frequently in Matthew chap 8: 16 and 17 when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sicknesses so here's the Fulfillment in the writing in the inspirational writing of the works of Jesus Christ that he cast out Spirits with his word and by his word he healed the sick this is this is even the prophecy of Psalms 107:20 he sent his word and healed them so now he's speaking the word and he's casting out Spirits by his word the sicker healed by his word and it fulfills he took on our infirmities and he bore our sicknesses Luke Chapter 5 verse1 15 and but so much the more went there Fame abroad of him in great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities the healing came by the hearing they hearing and they're healed by their infirmities Luke 7: 211 and in the same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight this is uh just a a sample of the many different instances in scripture where the sick were healed and we find where the blind can see and the lame walk and the dead are raised these are uh these are uh examples of the word healing the word delivering from destructions so it's no surprise in Mark chapter 16 that Jesus is going to give a Great Commission and he's going to tell them to preach the gospel and then there's going to be certain signs following because it's the very same things that were in Jesus Christ Ministry in verse 14 this is the preface to it to me is so important afterward he appeared under the 11 as they sat at meat and up braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart so here's the you know the 11 of the 12 disciples Judas having uh gone off the scene and he's upbraiding them with their unbelief in other words he's using their unbelief to say look I can't believe you didn't believe and oh you have little faith and the hardness of heart well where where was their unbelief and how was their heart hard because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen this is important to catch it it's and I think we mentioned this before it's not that their testimony or their witness should have been foreign to them because there was already a promise that it would happen right and so if they would come saying that we uh we we found Jesus uh riding a Tesla plaid it's you know candy red and and you should come see him they like that doesn't even make what is that we don't even know what that is what are you talking about but they said he's risen on the third day the tomb is empty and they ought to have remembered well that's exactly what his word said and they they should have believed him on the report of the disciples and so he is disappointed of their unbelief and their Hardness of Heart that they didn't believe the witness of those who had seen him and then immediately he says and he said unto them go into all the world and do the same thing that you didn't believe go go into all the world tell everybody I'm resurrected and I want them to believe like you didn't believe when you were told That's Unique isn't it you didn't believe me when they told you I was risen but I want you to go into all the world and preach the resurrected Jesus Christ and if they don't believe you they're damned no wonder he ided them for their unbelief and Hardness of Heart he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature so it's the preaching of the gospel and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned so what's the most critical thing we recognize in this scripture faith faith is the most critical thing because without faith you're damned without faith you cannot please God go into all the world and preach the gospel what is the the desired result of preaching the gospel that people would believe and in believing they would be baptized that that's it preach the gospel that people would believe and that's the believe and be baptized and they are saved I kind of you say that just sums it up that's the Great Commission and that's what God desires us to do God desires that we would take him at his word that's why I think even the the leadup to this is he up braided them with their unbelief and their Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen that God wants us to believe upon the report or testimony of his word believe it according to his promise it says in John chapter 6 verses 28 and 29 then they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God people want to always do something outstanding and he says what shall we do that we might work he says in verse 29 Jesus answered and said to them this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent and I could put it this way faith is the chief result amen it's the chief work of God I that when when when God is in it faith is the product of it that's the work of God that you believe that that someone would Testify the word of God someone would preach the word of God and the work of God is that you believe you catch that because there's a way that we just diminish it so much to where like no no no no no no no no the work of God would all of a sudden for him to appear in a holographic form right now but no the work of God is that you believe this is the work of God that you believe and we know that that faith that belief comes by the word so it's the word that God uses to instigate belief and that's his that's the conviction it's actually said uh of the in the Old Testament I think they've uh narrowed the law down to 613 different precepts a and they and the Jews actually taken habac and they say that all 613 are summed up in this one precept the just shall live by his faith 613 laws and Commandments and and to them to the Jews that would think all of these are precious they would say that life is bound up in this one phrase the just shall live by his faith and so this is a statement we've been reading quite a bit and what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith he says now the initial and original way to receive any Redemptive blessing is hearing the word of God because Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God like the ministers preach we're not using wanting to use philosophy or logic just for this to make sense but if you were sick and never knew you could be healed chances are there's not going to be uh there's not going to be maybe some osmosis where I'm just going to look at you and kind of Nod knowingly and you're like what are you what are you staring at me for you're making me feel weird like you would you learn about the power Divine Healing primarily you learn about the power of God to heal by someone telling you he can this is the this is the order of scripture and he says faith cometh by hearing he says like the ministers preach and that's the original way the word preached brings forth faith provokes faith and that's what brings any Redemptive blessing and I I love how he goes takes this step further if that were you and I that would be sufficient and you and I said that's right if you don't believe me fine if the people didn't want to believe us why just let them go on but God is so good so remarkable the nature and character of God we think God's just dogmatic he sent his word and healed them that's it if they don't want to believe it the work of God is to believe so if they don't believe then they've Deni the word of God but God is so good and so full of Mercy till after that he sent his word then he sent gifts into the church and so the gifts in the church are to help us to what what come to a place of believing it's God's way of getting us to accept him and receive him and have our faith placed in him so God is so good that he sent gifts into his church so now back into the the the Great Commission go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth on uh believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and so he sends his word and we would say that should be sufficient but God is so good till he sends gifts into his church Church to follow the word so in verse 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe so notice the order they that believe or preaching the gospel signs are following in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is part of the Great Commission this is part of God sending gifts following the word word in order to build our faith or to provoke faith in him these signs shall follow them that believe we recognize the order that we're not following after signs but signs are following the believer in the sermon Jehovah gy says so your gift and he's referring to ministers that he' asked to come onto the platform and pray and form a prayer line he says and and he's talking about you could take the word and teach these things he says so your gift is to do that and that's the original way believe his word he sent his word and healed them that's the way it's supposed to be I'm just making reference to these these statements a and and just for full disclosure it's not like brother brandham said it 1181 times where every time he just kind of makes reference to this but there's there's a frequency to it and there's an emphasis in these different places where he's just wanting us to recognize that the word is what does it that's the way it's supposed to be but then God God is so good and makes such promises because that's the original way take them at his word but it's still in the nature of God it's not that the God God hasn't said well just take me at my word if you won't believe me I'm just going to subcontract this out to the devil and let him do the signs and wonders that that's what it takes to get you to believe it's not that God is varying from his nature or or doing something wrong but he says if he so good and make such promises if they can't believe the word then he shows them a sign that it's him there that is what it's for God is so good that when we don't have the faith to believe that it's him he does something for us isn't that wonderful to know that God will do it that it if that in that we're we're not certain and and we're not sure and I think it's even in the resurrection of Lazarus he says that that the others might believe and and that that they might recognize and hear he begins to he begins to pray and there's certain things that that God will do because he recognizes Lord I believe help thou my unbelief and so he does something to draw you into confidence to draw you into trust I was taking time this past week to go over I I kind of I have a list of 37 different Miracles that Jesus had performed and the the different mechanics to each time someone was healed and how in one instance he just tells a leopard go wash and be healed but then in another instance he actually lays his hands on him and he prays for him and and when you recognize that you realize that for the one the word was enough right but for the other there may have been some stigma there may have been some scar there may have been some ostracization there might have been some lack of confidence does he view me like everybody else am I just an outcast am I a Scourge on society so he takes him and he touches him and removes all the complexes removes all the fear removes the stigma and that becomes the very thing that opens up the fow ground of the heart to receive his healing because God is so good he'll meet us where we are not to keep us there but to take us deeper into trust with him they can't believe the word he shows them a sign that it's him here him there that's what it's for and so as we would see Jesus he says Divine Healing is not done by a man the Divine Healing is a finished product the only thing a minister can do is preach the word a a a minister cannot heal you no surprise there we have just within the body of Christ I can say this on any level whether it be uh evangelists teachers pastors the gifts that are operating in the bride of Christ these days are just beyond uh description beautiful gifts of God rightly dividing the word of Truth signs and wonders following powerful meetings uh the word of God just being laid out word by word by word All Around The World God is God has God ordained uh men who are lifting up the uh the word of Jesus Christ ministering to the bride of Christ but none of them can heal you am all they can do is preach the word he says that ought to be sufficient that ought to settle it now why why would he make these statements not to create a stigma on anything else not to create a resistance or reluctance to anything else but that we might recognize the order because we could look at it it says well the word is preached but then the gifts happen the signs happen the Wonders happen then that must be what the ultimate is the word comes first and then ultimately we have these manifestations and this power and we like well then that what what it must be for but no the word comes and it ought to be sufficient to produce Faith but in the absence of Faith being instigated by the word god is so gracious to bring signs that it might do what the word originally was supposed to do create trust and confidence in God so word manifestation Faith so you're you're not coming back to the the demonstration or the outward manifestation as the ultimate the ultimate Is What It produced in your heart right now if you could focus very intently with me this is going to be very treacherous what I were trying to do this morning and I I I had the thought when I was coming up to walking out of the church that uh I think God is making me uh pay a little bit for preaching so much about tremendous humidity back East because I have never experienced such humidity here in Arizona and uh Lord forgive me I don't know what I do I'm sorry I take it all back I'll print a retraction in the morning whatever it takes and also Brother Martin Sister Pro it's good to have you back I hope you've recovered from the wedding brother the Martin told me be glad you only have one daughter and three sons and so let me know how the rest of it goes what the secret is it's nice to have them back now it's this I say Focus because balance is so important is there's going to be things I read even things I've already said that in your mind you may have already built up a complex because you've heard it misused taking the word of God turn it into a club to beat people who believe in Divine Healing beat Ministries that have demonstrations in their Ministry gifts oper signs and wonders following uh powerful meetings and and testimonies and healings and and even to some degree prophecies and things and you could take script you could take these very things and try to uh oppose other Ministries and oppose other men and so then I might read something and you might have a little bit of a complex built up against it but I say don't don't put it in my don't put paint me with any particular brush and don't put it in that channel you just trust God today for your own sake to even believe that if I'm up here with a certain bent and a certain motive and objective and I've got an ax to grind that God will just take it from my be once it leaves my mouth he'll take it and rightly divide it to your heart so that you can place the word properly but Focus very intently because the balance is so important it's an extremely important balance but when brother says the only thing a minister can do is preach that ought to be sufficient that ought to settle it is because that's the original way is to believe his word when he sends it that's the Supreme way so the Supreme way and the best way would be word only and all the parents said amen like that's it I shouldn't try and entice my kid to do something by giving them gifts I shouldn't have to try to uh you know Co coer compliance uh by promising them all sorts of uh you know binge of movies or something no it's say I ask you to do it you ought to do it so it shouldn't be hard it shouldn't be too far for us to understand that that is the the Supreme way the word only and so the purpose of the gifts the purpose of signs and wonders is so that the word can rise to preeminence that that's the reason even as we I think it was this past Wednesday that we were speaking on one of the uh on the subject of the seven bad habits of highly ineffective parents and how the purpose of discipline and the purpose of using our voice and how it's all working together to cultivate the child's character not just a mechanism to vent frustration or a mechanism to deal with a a a temporary uh behavioral issue right is to is to produce long long-term character and and ways of assessing right and wrong and ways of making the right decision and that's what God wants to do with signs and wonders is he wants us to come to a place to where the word has preeminence now I I want to express it this way you're going to be turning to James chapter 5 I want to express it this way maybe kind of as a paradigm shift and as I think about it it might not make much sense but the original way is not just the point of origin but it's the ultimate Destiny does that make sense okay good I'll just look at you while I'm talking about this because we think about the original way the original the original original and so there's a point at which we say well that was the original and then we we start from there that's the way it begins well how does it end and where do we go from there but in this sense I'm wanted to kind of shift our Paradigm towards like well the word only but yeah you got the word but then now we've got this but brother bandam takes it in the indictment says from then on comes the word and the word only so in the end it's the ultimate so you have an original way and then we we can say well that's the way it starts but how does it end well that's the way we end the word is the ultimate destiny we could say well and maybe I'm I might be getting a little bit away from myself here there's that age-old question do we go back to Pentecost or do we go beyond Pentecost right maybe that's what we wait and debate here after service is back to or Beyond but let me just put there you better have been there you you better have been there or you'll never be there right in James chapter 5: 14-15 he says is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up if I if I'm able to maybe next Sunday I like to come back to this Dynamic of laying hands some of the where where these things are coming from but to me it's just so plain and it fits with Mark chapter 16 they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so if there's anybody sick call the Elders let them anoint them with oil praying over him and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord will deliver them heal them this is part of the establishment of the Christian church this is part of our foundation and the doctrine of the Apostles it's a necessary foundational principle of Faith this is part of the word amen absolutely part of the word now and I think this is where we kind of touched on a little bit last time and we're going to use a a little bit different maybe some different statements to emphasize this again but there Comes a Day July that you have someone who's sick and they call elders and they anoint with oil and they're going to lay hands on them they're they're going to say pray the prayer of faith and there's all sorts of elements where we say well Elders oil right there's all these other things that begin to enter into the picture that if we're not careful the people can make an idol out of the hands an idol out of the out of out of the anointing out of the oil an idol out of the Dynam the mechanics of it and and brother brandom even mentions it I think we this is where we read the statements a couple weeks ago where he says look what's happened with the little Ministry God's given me how much confusion it's caused because the way in which it was operated everyone wanted to kind of mimic the mechanics right and reproduce the same thing and so I want to put it this way and when I say when I say a danger a danger Li I when in going down this path and this kind of if this kind of gets you excited you all want to kind of grab your buckets of popcorn say well let's see what happens to brother Aaron when he goes down this path uh it's very easy to be misunderstood very easy to be misunderstood and and and you could be very you can be criticized easily criticized because you make certain statements and it's very easy to say well just put them in this bucket there are uh no Divine Healing uh days of Miracles are passed they're just a Ted talker right there's going to put you in a particular category and so I'll I'll run the risk so that you can be free and I'll take the criticism so that your faith can operate where God wants it to operate but there's a Tipping Point there's a Tipping Point where the very things that God has used in order to establish faith and to build our faith that it starts working counterproductive to Faith brother BR even I meant to look this up before service he makes a statement that in the Great commission he said go into all the world baptizing them in the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost it's in the word but he says they used it as a ladder to walk right out of the word to even say that demons travel in that appalation but wait a minute hold on it's in the word the misuse of it changes its utility right I think it was on Wednesday night we talked about you can't take the word of God says says beat them beat them and it won't kill him beat them and drive that Spirit from all right well the Bible says beat him so I'm going to beat you can't take the nature of the word and the character of the word out of the word and use the word and expect to get the word results it's going to be something totally different altogether and so there's a Tipping Point now in 1 Corinthians chapter 1: 12 to1 18 and I I have to go I I need to speed up a little bit here now this I say that every one of you saith I am a Paul and I have Apollos and I I have sephus and I have Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God that I baptized none of you now that statement is kind of like whoa wait a minute what isn't the Great Commission you know some Apostle you are bud but he says I thank God I baptized none of you and meanwhile there's guys over there you know like with their books saying look how many I baptized and all a sudden Paul says I'm glad I didn't baptize any of they're like oh well you know and they start comparing their journals he says but Chris and GA so at least he baptized somebody and then he says lest any should say that I had baptized my own name what is Paul identifying this part of human nature that fixates on the tangible on the person on the minister right on on the anecdotal evidence of things and like they're going to find a feather build a chicken right and so he's he's aware of this and he says and I baptized also the household of stephanus so he realized no not just Chris and gas but also the household of stephanus and we're all kind of happy to know that at least he did baptize maybe not as many as others but at least he did baptize what is Paul identifying this kind of this tendency maybe for some people to scoreboard well how many miracles have you had how many people did you lay hands on right that's why we like these cordless mics we can bless God's people with two hands he says I besides besides that I know not whether I baptized any other so I mean you could say Crispus gas and I don't know how big the household of stephanus was but I'm sure it wasn't a thousand right so Paul is uh Paul is you know just not very many verse 17 for Christ sent me not to baptize hold on wait a minute so he's not commissioned does he not fit in Mark 16 I'm confused here he says I was not sent God did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel I know it might seem and maybe just the way I'm presenting it kind of makes it seem to be a little bit of a bigger hard stop than it ought to be he says I wasn't sent to baptize but to preach the gospel but what's the outcome of preaching the gospel people would be baptized so the ultimate's not the baptism otherwise if we wanted baptisms I'm pretty sure we could have a session next Sunday and we could just train you to go out as door to-door salesman and and we could be busy right in that little tank out there just baptizing them right give a little commemorative towel with our church website on it but that's not the goal the goal is to preach the word to preach the gospel and he says Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Christ lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but us which are saved it is the power of God where where where's the stigma on the preaching says the preaching to them that perish is foolishness it's a way that is called heresy you're traveling down this road and everyone's like you're a fool you're a fool but trust me one day they'll see that it was wise one day this way is going to be proven to be the Wise Way stick with it stay with it he says the Cross of Christ should be made not effect if I just come with the wisdom of words he says but the preaching of the Cross to them that perish is foolishness but to us it is the power of God preaching the word is the power of God and I think this is where Paul is identifying this hidden trap where he says I'm of Paul I'm of Apollos I'm of sephus and he there's a there's a way that in the preaching of the Gospel if something begins to get have a little bit of the preeminence or emphasis we can establish our faith on the basis of Trad ition or the basis of the works and not the promise in the word because he says that Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel and could we not say that according to the commission that the desired result of preaching the gospel is that people would believe and be baptized so Paul is realizing that if I could just keep the main thing the main thing right if I could just keep the first thing first and Minister the gospel then the results will follow but if I start to put something forward just a little bit it's going to be human nature to gravitate to that as a comfort as a security blanket why had Paul baptized me who baptized you Jesus makes reference to it in Mark 7:3 making the word of God of none effect through your tradition they were brother R talks about so indoc they were so indoctrinated with the mechanics that they can't can't see the word they can't see the forest for the trees they're so fixated on the specifics they're so fixated on certain particular aspects of it that they don't step back and see how it all speaks of Jesus Christ how it fits into the plan of God and through their tradition they take the word of God and by building a tradition around it what it was supposed to do in the beginning is no longer effective and Paul says I don't want to make the mistake when preaching the gospel to put the emphasis on something else so that the word of God and the preaching of the Cross is made ineffective I don't want it to turn into something to where I put so much emphasis on the baptism they're not even listening to what I said and it's not Faith that's being conjured up by the preaching of the Gospel people are just lining up to be baptized not because I preach the gospel and therefore you say well they were they heard you preach and they were baptized but the gospel wasn't effective there was too much of a robust machine there was things were too much too much tradition and they were just in that old habit and pattern of doing it where no one ever took time to stop and ask themselves what are we doing this for what is this supposed to produce what if we keep doing this what is it supposed to look like in 15 years in Hebrews chap 4:2 Jesus said they made the word of God a n effect through tradition in Hebrews 4:2 Paul says For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it they saw Miracles they witnessed the supernatural but brother man says it wasn't mixed with personal faith that that was never added into it that was never the additive there were signs wond wonders and miracles and the Word was preached but the word preached didn't profit them despite all of the signs because at the end of the day there was never their own faith that became the additive their own personal faith was never joined to what the word now if that doesn't if that doesn't create some uh some mind candy to think about for a while and be like so the word preached signs and wonders and my faith my personal individual Faith could be to all these things but never actually mix with the gospel because preaching is the power of God so Paul then directs our Focus back to the word as the Builder of our faith brother man writes this in chapter two of the church age book Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set the captiv free recognize purely the way he just described it preach the word and it leaves like a missile it leaves a a as a a a a sword of God a flaming sword that's going to cut to the conscience so the preaching of the word this is what's happening the word's being preached but it's impacting the individual and it's cutting out diseases and setting the captiv free so it's not just the word preaching and it rattling around in your head I I I like that we can emphasize this because there's a way that you can try to take the word of God to say that you're just going to preach the word and nothing ever changes and just leave and convince yourself that the word is powerful that's that's not that's not what we're selling if that's what you want there's a lot of other places to go if you just want to sit there and just pretend that things are changing but he says the gospel demonstrated itself everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel word and confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed Devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last agage it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom with the word fill your heart and mouth with the word let that word be added to your faith let it add let it add let it add let it boil up let it be on your lips speak it because that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians so the word spoken can demonstrate itself the word can cut like a knife and set the captiv free so Paul is Paul is bringing it back to that it's not just try to conjure up by slide of hand or by Optics or by smoking mirrors or just by you know some pure effort inspiration convince people to be healed but preach the word put your confidence in the word build confidence in the word 1 Corinthians chapter 2: 4 to 5 so this is just right in the next chapter and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power oh there's just so much we could say about the demonstration of the word demonstration of the spirit and of power it's not just in enticing words but the word came with demonstration it came with power however you want to describe it it came with demonstration it came with power why that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God do not forget the desired outcome of the demonstration he preaches the word but not just with things that kind of tickle the ears and entice the mind and engage our thoughts because then that would just be man's Wisdom but he preached the word in demonstration of the spirit and power there were signs followings there was something demonstrated and manifested once the word was preached not that you would put your confidence in Paul not that you would put your confidence in the demonstration not that you would just lust for signs and wonders but that your faith would stand in the power of God what is the power of God it is the gospel amen do not forget this outcome that Paul desired when he said these the the demonstration was there so that we'd have faith in God that's what Paul I believe tells the Corinthians let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of what laying on of hands and you listen to the Hebrew series and brother Brandon makes some very strong statements in this regard very strong statements one that even to this day I you for myself personally I'm wanting just to see how these things can just click together in that particular series some of the ways he places the scripture it's just absolutely amazing and so in Hebrews chap 12:2 he says looking unto Jesus the author looking un Christ the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the author or the originator the beginner and the finisher or the perfector of our faith faith has a beginning and faith has a a perfection not that it has an end but it has a a somewhere complete brother brandham in the sermon what are Visions for or what our Visions he's talking about kind of Americans are just kind of they always want you kind of touch I don't know what it is with Americans they're want they want to touch they want laying on of hands he says but we want the greater faith we want to run a higher level the Lord Jesus wants us to believe him so this is this is where again this is where it could get like it's a competition well I've got 77 points of Faith how many do you have 31 well too bad it's not 33 that would be better right and and we kind of keep the scorecard it's not that he's just saying we want the greater faith we want to run at a higher level so we want Faith that's what we want but the potential that faith is really untapped I was going to get into it today and I realized there was I had such tremendous wisdom just to take a whole section of notes out because I don't know if I'll get to the the ones I have here but brother random when he begins perfect Faith he makes some statements now what happens at the end of perfect Faith he has a prayer line and he says I did this for a purpose go back to the beginning he says if you had perfect Faith you wouldn't be standing in a prayer line but that's the way that he describes it if you had perfect Faith you wouldn't be standing here so he preaches on perfect Faith then has a prayer line it's talk about that at lunch because Faith grows there's measures of Faith amen brother BR says your faith is not what you feel your faith is what you believe 1 Thessalonians 3:10 just to kind of capture the thought of Faith maturing he says in second Corinthians that your fa when your faith is increased not that when you finally believe but when your faith is increased there's a measures of Faith there's an increase there's a grow of faith in Ephesians till we all come into the unity of the faith to the statute of a perfect man what that's Faith growing first Thessalonians 3:10 night and day praying exceedingly this is Paul I pray night and day exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith this is the desire of an apostle for the people I I want to come and minister to you that I might perfect what is lacking in your faith not give you Faith you brutes you rebels you people full of unbelief but I want to take what's not perfect in your faith and add to it that it might be without lack and how do that happen Faith cometh by hearing Romans 10:17 Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God not sure if we used these before I skipped over a large portion a couple weeks ago brother Bram in the message hear ye himym says Mr arganbright said to me that number seven because he's calling prayer cards he says number seven was already healed while I was preaching praise the Lord that's good that's the original way I wish Tommy Osborne if he' had come tonight that's his he's talking about God that's his way of doing it he wished brother he wish his brother Tommy Osborne was there to see that this is the ultimate why because I think it was brother Tommy Osborne who saw when brother brandham was doing healings and all these things he looked at if I'm not mistaken uh uh brother Tommy osor looked at says I can do that that's exactly what he thought oh I see what brother bram's doing I could do that and brother Bram saying I wish he was here I I I I I wish he was here so that he could he could see that this isn't the ultimate I think it was brother Lee Val that said that told that story of Tommy Osborne how he said when I saw that he said' I could do that brother Lee said I could see visions and Technicolor and I knew I could never do something like that but that's the original way that's his way of doing it preaching the word and that's the way to do it preaching the word and to get healed by preaching God sent his word and what did it do heal them that's right that's good that's the original way is preaching the word so the ultimate outcome is not that you're healed but faith in God and the original way think of that the original way to be healed is by the word being preached that's the original way he says I'm going to skip I'm skipping this again for the second time but we're just going to have to do it brother well I have to read a portion of this and the end time sign seed brother R's talking about a 17-year-old girl who's laying on a stretcher uh she had cancer and he makes the statement this girl cannot live and I think he says this at the beginning of the service and so uh he's he's talking this kind of telling the story she's Afflicted she's with on a stretcher she's gonna die brother B says to prove something to my church I never touched the child at all I never as much as touched her now hold that in your mind to prove something he never touched her now it's not that there would have been something bad if he touched her it's not that if he touched her he you know something bad was going to happen but he wanted to prove something to the church he says so I never touched the child at all went right to the pulpit with the word stayed right with the word and the word healed her so instantly until she got up and walked away is all right now living like anybody else can't find a trace of it anywhere never even touch tched her see the word went forth and she believed the word and the word is God's life and God's power and the word is what does it the word heals the sick and in that scenario her faith could have only been in the word right cuz there was nothing else it wasn't like they called brother Mesmer to the organ it's not that brother brandham got up there and cracked his knuckles and called for the dotera and just got all ready and smacked her on the forehead right and and and all of a sudden she's like man next time I'm sick I'm just going to I'm going to come and have that happen again it could have only been Christ there there was there was nothing else in the picture it was Christ only it was the word being preached so I just I I I did this to prove a point this is what he says I did it to prove a point I never so much touched her I went to the word I went to the pulpit immediately with just the word stayed right with the word and the word healed her instantly I I would say that there's a a lot of conscious intent here with brother brandom and a lot of humility to where it would have been easy for him to vindicate himself by saying you young lady in this stretcher you can't live unless God does something for you impress himself and even by her own desire to be healed manifest some gift demonstrate some discernment and which is the power of God and then her to be healed but he says I wanted to prove something so I just laid in the word now why would he need to prove something I'll acknowledge that uh this is this is my this is my uh tie-in and so I I'm not brother B doesn't say the reason why I tried the reason why I had to prove it he just says to prove something I never touched her and he demonstrated that the word preached could heal somebody and and I say for me the way it strikes me is he needed to prove something to this church had seen these miracles for so long because there's a Tipping Point there's a Tipping Point for the positive and for the negative and so brother brandham knew it's reaching critical mass where they've got to have their emphasis on the word that that's got to be what they begin to take the holding because why people were making him God people were putting way too much emphasis on him other people were thinking oh prayer lines run this run that all sorts of impersonations so I got to bring it back to the word because there's a Tipping Point both for the negative but also for the positive on one side there's a point at which once you reach it and go past it your faith is weakened but on the other side there's a Tipping Point where with the momentum of God's word your faith is actually perfected it's interesting which way that could go the Tipping Point is a point at which a series of small incidents become significant enough to cause a larger more important change some interesting debate points on the atmology of a Tipping Point a tip point in these things but the way that it's used now is to identify a series of things series of events and happenings that are imperceptible essentially maybe they're they're not real large they're incremental not any real giant things happening but one after another they just kind of build and build but it builds to a certain point to where all of a sudden it tips right and there's there's scholarship on it there's books on it I'm not so much trying to focus on uh how Malcolm Gladwell brother Gladwell would put it uh though it was a very fascinating book but it's an idea that things reach a boiling point like well how did we get here it took time and little things were happening but it gets that point to where you may be seen those things where something's filling up and filling up and filling up and all it dumps because there's going to be a point where that momentum tips it it's a point of critical mass and so there's a there's a that that idea exists in the word of God line upon line precept upon precept word upon word in the sermon perfect faith brother is the word operate in human flesh by physical signs material Signs by scriptural signs perfectly to bring you to a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture that that's the way that it ought to be working sign after sign Wonder after Wonder material after material all these things happening to bring you to a perfect faith for perfect Rapture listen all this word one day is going to reach a Tipping Point and this body is going to go right it's going to change one day why because that body is going to materialize around the word that you're feeding on that word that you're watering is going to lead you to your unseen bridegroom one day and it's going to be incremental step by step inch by inch fiding every step of the way and one day it's going to reach a Tipping Point and faith is going to be made perfect that's how it happened with Abraham right just a regular routine of following the scripture the plans of God that's how you get to Supreme faith brother Brown said in spiritual food due season he says I want you to get built up now in the Holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you've heard preached the signs and wonders that you've seen done believe in it don't look back and begin to doubt it well I guess we're supposed to be Beyond this I guess that never happened no no if you hadn't been there you need to go there right if if you haven't if you've never had that alter experience in your heart if you've never had a born again experience if you've never had the genuine Pentecostal experience which is to be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to have it and just because there's a teaching in the word of God that we've got to come to a place of maturity doesn't mean we look back on that like ah hogwash nothing to it you'll never get to maturity unless you've been born but he says he wants you to think about it believe it all you've seen believe all you heard believe everything that's been preached believe the signs and wonders he says we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider whether it be of God or not so he says I Want to Build You Up in the Holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour and in order to achieve the faith of this hour he wants to use the momentum of all that God has done so there must be a cumulative effect of all the things that God is doing to bring you to perfect faith not to cabbage down on something but it must all be working to build momentum to a place of perfect Faith the faith of this hour the faith to be changed it's going to take more faith in this age than there ever was in any other age and you have to this has to we have to keep this in mind the purpose of it because if we lose focus the devil fights this wonderful truth of Divine Healing and marks it up he would love just to Twist it just a little bit that sigh is it's the after hour and I I I think I should probably stop eventually so let me just look at this for a moment to see where I could stop let's just go now the Tipping Point on the other side because there's a Tipping Point of the accumulation of Faith to bring us to a perfect faith for a Rapture now the I want you to hear these statements and just recognize that brother brandham is taking maybe taking the risk but feeling impressed enough to at least acknowledge something that's happening within his meetings he says in the sermon angel of God in 47 now the angel of God had told me that it would come to pass that they wouldn't believe unless there was a miracle and your words have been proved he's warned by the angel Lord there's going to come a point where the people won't even believe you anymore unless you do a miracle now that has to be counterproductive right that he sends his word and so he gives signs and wonders that you might believe his word ultimately so that you could go oh that's exactly what he said I'll believe his word I'll take him at his word but it has a negative effect eventually he says the angel Lord's acknowledging this Tipping Point that would come to a point where the people would get so jaded that they wouldn't take you at your word but they would make you perform a miracle in order to believe four years later he says the same thing in a similar sermon Angel of the Lord you say brother brandham you pray for me you believe I'll get well yes I can believe it but I won't know it until he tells me so then when I see the vision that's it then I know it's going to be so there's a can you pray for me and tell me I'm going to get it well and he says well I can't I can't tell you that thus sayith the Lord that Vision unless he shows it to me and he says he says this that and in doing that that weakens my faith a little on the other side okay because I get a vision that someone's going to be healed it has some opposite effect on the other side he says because I'm looking to that direct positive side always out just to give an example I believe it was was this is in 1964 I believe he preaches in Topeka and there's a minister that' been crushed by something and and he was very burdened for this Minister and he's like oh I just wish God would give me a vision to go into that H that hospital lay give me a vision of him being healed I'd walk right into that hospital and say thus sayith the Lord you rise out of this bed and be made well and then it Dawn on the same faith that I would have in the vision to tell him he can be well is the same faith that I could take to pray for him and believe that it'll get well and so that's to me like the perfect the beautiful order and the symmetry of it that he's realizing that if God will do it in this Supernatural way could he not do it in this way is it not the same faith and and he's identifying just how that's an example how it began to weaken him a little is he was like man I I I really wish I could pray for this brother but I don't have a vision I really wish he could get well but God hasn't showed him anything he's like wait a minute wait a minute I'm looking too much to this Vision this direct positive side and it's weakened my faith in the promise lay hands on the sick pray for them and they'll recover he said that's what hurts in my meetings many times the people watch to get in the line to get that direct positive side of what's going to happen to them that that's a that's a statement they miss the point they get in the line to get that direct positive side side and he says the fact that the supernaturalist demonstrated itself has brought the people to a point where they won't believe unless there's a miracle and that it actually hinders him in his meetings because people come up in the line and they want to see the supernatural not take God at his word and they've missed the whole point and basis of it and when you miss the point and basis for Divine Healing the whole in this in the desire and seeking it it can actually weaken your faith I'll pick up on it on next Sunday where you begin to Major on a minor and it'll never work brother Bram says in the unchangeable god that's the reason they give prayer cards if you don't you'll come right back in the line again come back again it just weakens your faith each time go weaker and weaker weaker and weaker so it's not it's not uh this isn't a statement against prayer lines it's a statement against human nature to to make an idol out of the line and to engage in the traditional approach to the hands or the laying on of hands the anointing with oil and whatever it might be to the point to where I he says I have prayer cards because if we just opened it up the same people would always be coming through and I would do them a disservice because they're going to come through looking for something to happen and it not happened and they're going to go out like well it didn't work I better come through the line again and they're not coming through the line again with the faith that's been bolstered or encouraged but one that's a little bit more less hopeful and more anxious it didn't work the first time I wonder if it'll work this time and you can actually set yourself up for failure by continuing to repeat a certain kind of behavior and it never achieves the results you want it to he says it weakens your faith each time the mess is perseverant what's the use of coming up here if you're just walking up here talking about the prayer line you walk through Tommy hi line and Tommy Osborne and or Roberts and back and forth through the line it only weakens your faith this is brother Brandon pointing to something I realize I've run out of time today to really amplify this but brother RS pointing to a Tipping Point he's not preaching against prayer lines not preach against laying on his hands not preach against Divine Healing not giving us all sorts of material that we can use as a codal to beat up the Evangelist and beat up the prayer lines and beat up the conventions and beat up no absolutely not if anything he's wanting us to realize realiz that the reason why those things aren't effective sometimes is because we've missed the whole point of those things to begin with and it becomes a cycle just a circle he's saying it's a line you never get out of it you're just walking in circles he says it only weakens your faith I've been in this person's line that person's line this person's line every year praying for the same thing only weakens your faith that's all when you come here with the full assurance that you're not walking before your brother or anyone else you're coming here because the spirit of God is in you has bid you come something is going to happen that's the basis for it there isn't anything going to keep you from it until then you're just on a walk right around next Minister comes in town right around next Minister comes right around just on a walk just old Johnny Crow walking in a circle just on a walk that's no good there's nothing in a preacher no more there is in your husband or your brother or whoever it might be remember waiting for a special time a special evangelist the super duper Divine healings and things he says anybody he says we're just representative of his telling you the word some of them sa have different gifts which the Bible speaks of these gifts this is all done to vindicate his presence what's the whole point of it all to vindicate his presence this is the original way God wants you to take him at his word this is all done to vindicate his presence I'm not asking I'm just going to make a statement an hour and a half isn't long I mean it really really isn't I mean never mind yeah it's just it's just not long God wants our faith to become F perfect faith in Luke Chapter 5:1 17 it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there are Pharisees and doctors of law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem teaching just teaching and the power of the Lord was present to heal them all why because it was done to vindicate his presence the preaching of the word is done to vindicate his presence the gifts and different things are all done to vindicate his presence that's the purpose of the Gospel the word is what declares Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the Living Word that makes God present that's the whole purpose brother BR says and then Jesus came oh I want you to believe without hands laying on just simply believe that the presence of the Lord is here to heal the sick this is what he wanted this is his heart's cry he makes this uh this similar statement in other places many times I want you to believe without hands being laid on you I just want you to Simply believe that the presence of the Lord is here to heal the sick that by the preach of the word you would believe that Jesus Christ is present that his ministry is this to declare him that he is here and that in the word being preached you believe that he's present to deliver you from anything to take him at his word believe that the presence of the Lord is here to heal the sick now the next statement if the Lord will come here and prove to you that his presence is here then whose fault is it yours is right it's my fault the word is preached and then as if to create a a a greater damnation he says the word is preached to believe that he's here and if you would come and prove his presence is here then it's your fault then to stare it in the face and not believe it why does he want him to believe without hands because that's the original way why is it it's your fault if he comes behind it and vindicates it with signs and wonders proving that the word that was preached was right why would it be your fault because that's the reason and purpose of all the gifts to begin with to trust God let me just point to this very quickly this message is a restoration back to the original that right it's what this message is it's it's not a Reformation it's a reform it's a a restoration back to the original and to get back to the original this is the Paradigm Shift maybe to get back to the original God uses signs and wonders in the ministry of brother brandham he didn't just show up in 1933 and says you got to go back to the beginning folks got to go back to the beginning and just some guys stand on the street corner seventh and pin and Jeffersonville got to go back to beginning folks God used the signs and wonders God used the Vindication to get the people's confidence if you could get the people to believe nothing would stand in their way he used to get back to the original he uses signs and wonders so the restoration of Pentecost signs wonders tongues the different ways that brother man refers to it was necessary to fulfill the potential of Pentecost we couldn't bypass that these things couldn't be eroded and you couldn't fall away from it and then we're just going to bypass it you had to come back to it brother BR said Luther Wesley p cost the Capstone right you know how that he goes 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 and he does that in many different places this last great step is on into Perfection there had to be there couldn't be this Gap Luther Wesley and then nothing there had to be this there had to be a step forward he says from Wesley it went to Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the Original Seed the restoration of the gifts the restoration of signs and wonders these things they come but after that something is to happen right that this is I realize maybe at this point I've spent so much time in this that it could be very very obvious to me and not necessarily so much obvious to you that it all builds you can't kick any of this out but it's coming to a point where produces something and that's when brother says to prove something it's it's not that his ministry was entirely without any signs and wonders and miracles and he goes I just want you to believe that you're healed and just think that you're healed and go home telling yourself you're well he wanted the people to realize that everything God has done to visibly manifest himself amongst us was so that we could further trust him not just the visible manifestation because Satan can impersonate any of those and the plot thickens you could even lay hands on the speak with new tongues and cast out devils and do many wonderful Works in his name and you go sorry I don't know who you are in Numbers chapter 20 we went through this on Wednesday night but in Numbers chapter 20: 7-2 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather out the assembly together oh I realized now when I said an hour and a half you thought total no I meant from that point on like another hour and a half wouldn't be long that might have been where the Mis there was a misunderstanding I apologize we won't preach Tuesday night if that'll make you feel better and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather out the assembly together together thou and Aaron thy brother now the rod is the instrument that he th cast down before pharaoh and turned into a serpent the rod is the instrument that he smoke the Red Sea this this Rod is very visible in the eyes of the people this Rod is what smoted the Rock in Exodus 17 but now God says take the Rock and speak ye under the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock not by smiting The Rock but by the word word it's going to usher for it's going to bring the word will bring it out of the rock not break it out of it not Smite it out of it but just the word itself would be enough to cause it to release itself and what an image it would be of people who have Stony hearts and how that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham by his word he's to do it not by brute force not by legalism but by the word he wants to turn your heart into a Fountain of Living water amen and he says so the congregation and so the congregation give the congregation and their Beast drink out of that rock and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded so far so good and Moses gather the congregation before the rock so far so good and he said unto them wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Moses you're supposed to speak to the Rock not them and with the hardness of a rock here now you rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand not to swear to God not to speak but with the rod and with his Rod smot The Rock Exodus 17 it came forth it doesn't happen so he smites it again and in just in a instant water came out abundantly that's a shocking picture and the congregation drank and their Beast also God said you will bring forth water out of the Rock and give to the congregation and their Beast to drink so smites The Rock twice water comes out they drink and then he it it's there's no hesitation at all and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because ye believed me not recognize the phrase because you did not believe me believe me to believe me in order to believe me to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I've given them that that's that seems extreme right but really you just look over you can look at Moses's life see a certain pattern but it was because it was that important what was being expressed here I know I've been long today but my Summer's just about over and so why we still have maybe some summer left for us I'm just going to take advantage of it but he says because you believed me not in other words Moses's Faith ought to have been greater at this point wasn't it Moses didn't believe at all if Moses had no faith he be like who's talking right yeah whatever the rod go some you talk to a rock you think I'm crazy no I mean Moses didn't he knew it was God he knew water would come from The Rock he didn't raise that rod and smite The Rock disbelieving in God's power to what bring forth water from a rock by striking it with a rod his experience had taught him that but there was something lacking in his faith now now God says because you believed me not you won't go into the promised land but if we were just to see it we didn't know this private conversation between God and Moses we would have seen Moses and Aaron are talking to God Moses comes out with the rod Moses walks up to the Rock doesn't Smite it once he smites it twice like yeah double portion woo right right it's getting better not just once twice next time Moses do it three times three times seven right that we we'd be looking at just on the face of it and have all sorts of ideas of what we think's happening but God in his private conversation with Moses says you didn't believe me and if we just watch Moses walk to the Rock use the rod and smite it Moses appears to have succeeded signs and wonders refreshment of the people he wrought A great miracle water poured forth from the rock but God says Moses you missed an opportunity what opportunity did he miss to sanctify to glorify me before their eyes Moses smoke The Rock and water came forth excellent God you said you wanted them to drink and they're Beast it's happening right now exactly what you wanted exactly according to what you the the outcome you were trying to produce and God's like no no that's not what I wanted I wanted them to get out of this habit of always complaining wanted to get out of this habit of no longer trusting me this they're always getting this point where Moses you brought us out in the wildness no no no no no Moses didn't bring you out into the Wilderness God did Ah that's right God did so he has a plan right there was so much of the focus that that where things were it wasn't producing even this far down the road you missed an opportunity to sanctify me before their eyes God wanted to reveal a greater power by Moses speaking to the Rock he wanted to bring forth a greater Faith he says you failed to create Trust in Me by speaking to the Rock before their eyes that's what you failed to do yes they drink yes they're receiving something Supernatural but it didn't instigate a greater faith in me you had an opportunity 38 years earlier in Exodus 37 he smot The Rock and water came that was in the beginning of the Exodus but now almost 40 years later God is wanting a greater demonstration well what could be greater than to Smite it twice what could be greater than to than to to show a greater fervency and a greater effort and a greater striking point but if I could say this they had reached this critical point in the journey where their faith needed to run at a higher level because they're going to need to cross the Jordan and possess the promised land and they were going to need to trust God that in the face of giants in the face of an insurmountable enemy that God would do exactly what he said and he wanted them to see that the word in their mouths can accomplish the hardest things Moses then by striking the rock actually worked against the Perfection of Israel's faith in the promise even though it produced a miracle it worked against the Perfection of their faith to take God at his word here at the doorstep of crossing over I could take God at his word and possess my mountain and possess the land and I like oh oh brother brenon would you please brother brenon would you please brother Moses would you please brother would you please listen to what brother brandham has to say about it the in iciency of the word is what Moses he says Moses testified to it the insufficiency of the word Moses testified to it the word wasn't right he had to be smitten again Moses testified by smiting The Rock twice that the word was insufficient you listening what a better way to get you through an hour and a half right the this statement is so striking Moses by striking the rock twice said the word wasn't right it's the insufficiency of the word he says in another place Moses when he did it it spoke to the weakness of the blood of Christ brother Bram said God's words to him you glorified yourself you took my power instead of sanctifying me you Sanctified yourself a Tipping Point brother BR says it broke the whole plan but he gave him his permissive will he broke the whole plan by smiting The Rock twice but God still let the water come permissively in the sermon the children of Israel I'm just reading these things because the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God he says this in Phoenix there's a perfect will of God there's a permissive will of God God permitted his Prophet to go on talking about balam yet it wasn't his perfect will this so the the context of this is Moses should have spoke to the Rock and the water would have come forth but he smites it twice when he does that he says the word isn't enough the word is insufficient the blood is too weak it glorified himself and it became permissive will God permitted it now this is what permissive will is and in the the image of balam it was his permissive will I feel this afternoon it's the same thing on working these for this miracle line with those healing lines the prayer lines we called Miracle lines it's may be permissive will but it's not as perfect will you're supposed to take my word and there's different places where brother's talking about the platform healings what is it he's referring to says it's hindered me in my meetings sometimes everybody's looking to what's happening on the platform becomes a show it's actually on stage it's why the third pull is different because the word has preeminence he's talking about these platform healings and he says God used it but I never thought it was his direct will it's been his permissive will permissive will not perverted will God's permitting it God's allowing it God's blessing it but it's not the ultimate in the sermon at Thy word he's talking about how he spoke to a man's arm that was uh mangled and it straightened out he said now that's the major and the real way that God wants to operate this this is just his permissive will this way it's just when I come here and pray and cry and beg to him before coming until that it's laying so close it forces me into it and you see the vision it'll cut off on the platform platform healings he's saying and there's so much here that I'm just pointing to maybe kind of wetting your appetite to go in and search these things out he's saying this is this is just I don't think this is the perfect will of God the way that it operates these things just come too quick and they go I'm begging I'm crying I'm pleading I'm trying to build this up because but the major in real way that God would want me to operate my gift is just to speak the word and it would have the results permissive will brother random says the seede shall not be a with the Shu the kingdom of God which is in the Earth today can never be set up just on a permissive will it's got to come back to his perfect will eventually the kingdom of God working in the permissive will come back to the perfect he said but if the people won't walk in his perfect one the seron does God ever change his mind he does have a permissive will he'll let you walk in he permits it all right but he'll make it work out for his glory in his perfect will what happened with Moses he didn't step into that perfect will I think that's a different statement there Moses didn't step into that perfect will here he is at the doorstep of the entrance and he had an opportunity to speak to the Rock and because he doesn't what does God say because you didn't speak to the Rock I'm not going to allow you to cross over Jordan alive look at the image then think of the point that we come to that brother the perfect Faith the word operate in human flesh by physical signs material Signs by scriptural signs to bring you to a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture it's got to come to a point where you let everything all the momentum of the Divine Promises of God God genuinely manifest himself in signs and wonders Miracles not s back well the devil's doing that the devil's doing that no believe in God take as word comes to point speak and go forward speak and possess the land speak and translate bring you to a perfect faith and does God ever change his mind about his word here's that statement bam had a gift of faith musicians you could come that way we're creating this creating the expectation for a close balam had a gift of faith and could have used it to the perfect original word of God many men on the field today with gifts of healing could do the same thing many men out here people speaking in tongues people prophesying a gift could use it for the kingdom of God but they don't do it and God blesses them anyhow gets the permissive will and here's kind of the edge but for popularity and pleasures and personal gains sold their birth rights as Esau did sold out to an organization sold out like balum is that what Paul was talking about I am a sephus I'm of apollis where people sell out their Birthright for popularity for pretense for personality and so Moses had an opportunity to demonstrate the maturing of the word over a 40-year period at the doorstep of an entrance into the promised land a placing a positional placing to speak the word and water would come that was a critical moment where instead of following God's perfect will his very actions testified of the insufficiency is that is that enough to really think about yeah is that enough to ask ourselves well then Lord how is it all working together Lord I don't ever want my faith to testify of the insufficiency of your word but thank God he knows when our faith is insufficient not the word but our faith and he'll demonstrate to us as is necessary for our faith to grow but Lord don't ever let me come to a place where the word isn't enough in the sermon why brother B said there's where Moses made a sin by striking the rock the second time instead of speaking to it he smote it the first time what did it speak of the second time what did it speak of the weakness of the blood of Jesus that he had have to be smitten for each individual that's what he testified it was a weakness it wasn't perfect Faith yeah I maybe there's just a lot more that well say next time it wasn't it wasn't repeating what he did in the beginning like now that's it that's where this all ends up that's what we come to is doing what we did in the beginning but no what he did in the beginning is with them there at the end the rod is still with them the evidence is still fresh the manifestation is a part of the testimony he stands there with the image not dis not not taking the rod and breaking it and saying there's nothing to it but it was there with him in the presence why as Vindication that in this moment the same God that could let RO water come from a rock when I smoted it is the same God that's going to back up my word and bring forth water from the Rock and what that would bring forth from the hearts of the people is to believe if God could do that by his word to the Rock what can his word do for me there would have been a greater trust a greater confidence a greater faith but when he struck it it spoke to the weakness of the blood he said Christ was smitten for our healing we just speak to the Rock now and it brings forth its healing but you see we've been taught wrong in all this here laying on of hands and Sensations so is it wrong to lay hands no Ian unless you're talking about these hands right is it is it wrong to lay hands on the sick absolutely not brother Brandon I think he says in one place I'm not one of these altar call preachers but he's not one of these preachers that's preaching an altar call is evil he's not preaching that laying hands on the sick is evil he's just saying there's a Miss there's an emphasis these are my words that there's a particular emphasis that gets the picture away from Christ in more on the the mechanics of things CU he says now we can speak to the Rock and bring forth healing we've been taught all this here laying on hands and Sensations don't ever build your hopes of Salvation upon a sensation cuz you can have all kinds of sensation but build it upon the word of God that is where you can beat Satan anytime upon the word it's thus saith the Lord we are taught that the word of God can defeat Satan anytime anywhere any place you say well where's the platform where's the tunnel of ministers where's the Saturday night where's the music music just right don't need any of that the word of God can defeat Satan anytime anywhere any place and so what are all these instances of the demonstrations and the manifestations of the power of God to do to cause you to trust him more he met me at an altar he met me in a prayer line that's a bonafied manifestation of the power of God and it gives me confidence to believe the same God who said you can lay hands on the sick and you shall recover is the same God that said by his stripes I am healed and now with my own mouth I can speak to the Rock now I can speak to the rock for my healing what a demonstration what a what a what a product of all the momentum of what God has done is to bring us to a place to take God Christ is my healer I've got one more service I'd like to express in this laying the foundation and then we can get into Divine Healing
