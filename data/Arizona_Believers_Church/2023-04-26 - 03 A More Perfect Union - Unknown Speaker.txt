TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but this is a third part in the series on perfect love and as we won't necessarily be tracking that particular title perfect love but that is the subject matter that we're on and tonight I want to look at a more perfect union the preamble to the U.S Constitution is where I got this from it was drafted in 187 18 1787 and in the Preamble it's not the part of the U.S Constitution it's the Preamble and so it's kind of setting forth the purpose of the Constitution and it really kind of captures what the intent of the writers were when they drafted it and what you're seeing here in that little clip is one of the remaining original printings that was done in 18 1787 by the Dunlap and Claypool company out of Philadelphia there's only a few of these remaining I was able to find a clipping of it was very fascinating history but the Preamble States we the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America so I'm sure this is where where you've heard it before all of you having memorized the Preamble quoting it along with me this is where I the idea and the thought was coming to me on a particular thing and I kept coming back to this phrase a more perfect union a more perfect union the more I thought about it the more I thought it was kind of a peculiar phrase and it it is kind of an odd construct to say a more peculiar a more perfect union and it has been interpreted many different ways several different times and kind of used in whatever time period to justify whatever people wanted to do at the time I believe after the Civil War it was being used as the events that have transpired have created a more perfect union and these events fit into the framework of the Constitution but the word perfect at the time when it was used it kind of means to be complete to uh to be finished also to be fully informed or to be confident about something to be certain about something and if you think about the word more perfect of the phrase more perfect I'll use this as an example um I when I would drink tea and maybe they said do you want it sweetened and I'd say ask for unsweeteness and you want any sugar and I asked for some equal and I'd have some equal with my T and then they'd give a refill and I'd be all out of equal and I'd ask for more equal and somebody would always have the dad joke at the table you can't get more equal right so if it's equal it's equal you can't be more equal and maybe it's the same thought process where how could you be more perfect because perfect is a word that many consider to be absolute in other words it is what it is it should not be qualified in a superlative way or a comparative way to be most perfect or more perfect it just kind of violates the meaning of the word and so more perfect may seem like a logical impossibility if something's perfect it's finished if something is uh is is finished it can't be more finished than what it is it is what it is and so a to say perfect and if perfect and Perfection is absolute then there should be no degrees of perfection and that might be and you might all be thinking I didn't know I was going to stumble into an elective history course tonight but I want you to think in terms of what we've been talking about a litmus test on having love being made perfect and how we think about perfect love and if you don't have it you won't be there and how we immediately begin to judge ourselves by that we're like well if I'm not finished then I'm not perfect then I don't have it there's a lot of conclusions we draw but I'm wanting to use this phrase a more perfect perfect union to kind of understand what God is doing in our life so don't get lost maybe here in the beginning this is just me being able to get my legs underneath me but if Perfection is absolute if perfect is absolute then there should be no Continuum of something being most perfect or more perfect but let me say this to say more perfect indicates progress towards perfection and this is what causes us to stumble sometimes when it comes to perfect love is we think we either have it or we don't if love is perfect or if perfect love is a finished love it's complete love it's an accomplished love and if I don't have that then I don't have it at all so we're kind of targeting that mindset to think oh no I don't have it I don't have perfect love and I don't have what it takes and we want you to kind of drive away any kind of fear or any kind of myth that keeps us from just accepting God's love for us and so when we use the phrase a more perfect union and as we use it tonight we want to express it to you it's suggests a union that is closer to perfection than it was before that there's something that ought to be in our hearts or we're striving for better we're striving for more and that we realize that we are a fallible human beings that are fallen in love with an infallible God and there's something reflected in his love that we want our our love to rise up to or maybe there's a Christ reflected in somebody else that we admire and we want Christ to be magnified in us the same way so to say a more perfect union I'm saying it's a Perfection it's a Unity a Harmony that's greater than it was before and if I could have a thesis statement just to make everybody cringe if the History part didn't get you to have a thesis that's in our pursuit of perfect love we are constantly striving for a more perfect union and this if we're going to lay aside everything until we can come to a place where we can love everybody and love our enemies then in this pursuit of perfect love we're striving for a more perfect union now there's a there's a Latin phrase I'd like to share with you and I know that you all know it and are familiar with it and uh and I know just right away you recognize it immediately but the phrase is the perfect is the enemy of good I believe we attribute to Voltaire he writes of it and attributes it to a Latin proverb and basically anybody ever heard that before I maybe hear it said you know don't let uh perfect become the enemy of good but it says the perfect is the enemy of good what it refers to is kind of the thought process where you insist on Perfection and insisting on Perfection often hinders any kind of progress knows if it can't be perfect then we don't want it at all and so we could say in the search for something that's perfect or without flaws uh will bypass many other useful things or refuse to use something or use a resource or enjoy something or have something because it's not perfect and so we use perfect the idea of perfection hinders us from even having good and so we could say this in the sense the perfect is the enemy of good instead of achieving something that's good or even implementing of something that's good we kind of stand still waiting for perfect perfect to come does that make sense as we let the perfect become the enemy of good so we have this kind of Chasm well if I'm not perfect then it doesn't matter or then nothing matters if I'm not perfect then I'm nothing if I if I'm not perfect then I have nothing and then if if it's not all then I don't want any and it's kind of a bad mindset where we do we let the Perfection become the enemy of the good to where we feel that we're so woefully short we feel that we can't measure up we're not perfect and that hinders us from even getting better brother Banner makes the statement press on in that perfect love I believe we referenced it on Sunday press on in that perfect love and to me it identifies that there's a process of our love being perfected by him that he is perfect love and if I have him I have perfect love but to the extent that I want to understand it to the extent I want to be subject to it to the extent that I can fully yield to it that's me pressing on in that perfect love not pressing my way into the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm I'm not pressing my way into the new birth but yet with uh there's something inside of me that longs for more there's something inside of me that's pressing and so if we use the phrase perfect love and this is just what I'm addressing through these first few Services it can make us feel that we've had either have it or we don't and I don't want us to let the perfect be the enemy of the good and let the Perfection become the very thing that discourages us and either causes us to quit or cause us to think that we don't have anything and I would say that it's easy for the Perfection to be used against us to take away instead of it being used to add to now picking up where we had touched on it before we were looking at the Garden of Eden brother Branham identifies that there there was perfect love and in the statement of Satan's Eden uh if I could say it this way love was not defective love had no flaw it was complete um and when they fell in the and if we look at this quote in Satan's Eden it's when they fell that that which was perfect uh was lost or done away with maybe I don't have those quotes for you but it was in Satan's Eden says they had perfect love one for the other perfect life forever they had perfect love perfect understanding the love of God they had God's word and kept it well that last phrase is familiar to us because this is the love of God that you know his word and that you keep it and so it's describing perfect love love has no flaws love has no fear love has no jealousy love has no anxiety love has never been rebuffed the lovers had never had any disappointments and so when mankind fell we we see that immediately as we touched on it last Wednesday they begin to play the blame game and love was being shifted around and love was being forgotten and they kind of got away from the perfect love and that's when perfect love is lost and it becomes defiled or imperfect but in the beginning I want to just use some statements here at the beginning without really being able to look into it very deeply they had perfect love they had a perfect understanding of the love of God and with that they knew his word and they kept it and in Genesis chapter 2 24 it speaks of uh they shall be the two shall be one flesh and so there was Unity among the man the woman and God it wasn't just the man to the woman it wasn't just the woman to the man but they were both United together and then also United to God brother Branham even used the phrase the unity of God to man when he's describing what they had in the beginning Humanity was one with God the man was one with the woman even to where it was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh they had a Harmony and a Unity uh that was that was Perfection and then they also shared that with god brother Branham said in the message Oneness he said they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God so this is this is the image that we see in the very beginning that there was Unity so I'm kind of building this to say a more perfect union we can look at the Garden of Eden said there was perfect love there was perfect harmony there was a perfect unity and God desires to have that kind of relationship with each one of us where it's in harmony that it is a it is a perfect union it is something to wear there there's a Oneness perfect love of God and a perfect understanding and that perfect harmony with God where they are one now I I'm drawing on your this is an upper level course maybe tonight even though it may seem very very simple and I'd be very very easy to understand I'm drawing on your prior understanding the knowledge of the message to teach these things but we're living in an age that's characterized as a restoration of what was lost in the Garden of Eden that that's the time that we're living in a restoration of the garden needing condition brother in the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed says the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden so it's back to an original Garden of Eden condition so there must be Unity there must be Harmony there must be Oneness there must be a Unity of God to man and brother Branham says that that purpose was manifested in Adam and Eve so there's something about their Union there's something about their Harmony there's something about their relationship and even if we want to call it a marriage that God was forecasting something God was expressing something and brother Benson it was perfect love Perfect all love all around them no fear at all and now let me say this about the time that we're living in and you believe that the bride has been raised up right I I believe that spiritually we're not living in laodicea now if you haven't been born again you're living in laodicea and physically we're living in laodicea but in a spiritual sense we know that there's been opened up to us a bright age and the bride age is the age of Union it's the age of the invisible Union it's the age of it's an age of perfection it is the Capstone age of Charity and that ceiling of God's bride in those final climactic promises that will result in the change of our body that's that's the time that we're living in it's a union age it's a perfect age it's a perfect love age that's the bride age but let me kind of leave that and I think that kind of wet some of our appetites we're thinking yeah that's the kind of stuff I want to hear but let me just leave it there and say laodicea is the opposite of all that it is the antithesis to all of this because the loudest teenager perverts and is the opposite of each one of these aspects it is the age of the false Union it is an age of a fake love or a false love it's the age of pretense it's the age of a false Union false love it's the age of pretending and in Revelations chapter 3 verses 16 15 16 and 17. this is the prognosis of laodicea I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou art cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm that's lacking Zeal it's tepid uh there it's not Ardent it's indifferent uh this is the age of a lukewarm love this is because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked these are the conditions of the age and brother Branham expresses some remarkable things about the condition of the age he says now when anybody says I have need of nothing he could very well be saying I have everything it's really interesting how it seems to be on either of these sides he says they could say I have need of nothing he could very well be saying I have everything or he could be saying I don't want any more as I'm full now you can express it this you can express this any way you want and it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent so it's not uh what's remarkable when you think about being lukewarm and the character of the age it's not even characterized as Rebellion it's not even being characterized necessarily as we hate Christ and we hate the cross and and we hate God it's such a complacency and an attempted love and tepid passion that he's kicked out of the church and they don't even care and they didn't even necessarily do it of their own volition like we don't want Christ they came so cold and so are so indifferent that he's kicked out of the church and he says add it up any way you want complacent she is satisfied with what she has she either figures she has it all or has enough there's just a lack of Interest there's a lack of passion it just an indifference I think is the way that I was pondering it this week it's just there's really no desire to grow no desire to know more of God it either comes from this place like oh we we know it we've got it figured out we know everything or we know enough we've come so far we know enough and what you'll find as we continue reading here and identifying some things in the message that what it's become for the church is it's all pretense so it's not a real genuine love affair and passion for the things of God it's more social and economical it's more for the appearance of things it's more for the popularity it's more for the power and it's not just the humbly being in love with God and knowing him more and experiences the consequences of pursuing his nature even the love of God is put on his pretense and and a relationship with Christ has put on his pretense for popularity and power among those who seem to be like-minded and we could find where this condition began by looking at Revelations chapter 2 verse 4. where he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee we're not taking the time maybe to lift up the compliments to the first church age but he's saying I have somewhat against thee this is the complaint in the first age because thou has left thy first love brother Brandon when he preached this uh this church age he said Ephesus was not a deceived Church it failed Itself by not continuing in perfect love so Ephesus was not a deceived church it was not characterized the same way that laodicea is where they're rich increase with goods and they have need of nothing but they don't know that they're poor and blind and naked and miserable and they're wretched people he's saying they're not deceived they just failed to continue in perfect love now that's remarkable because it's not the power of deception necessary that's working on them yet but by leaving their first love they're going to succumb to it they've lost their protection against it and brother Branham says this about the church age he says the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit it all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal this is what was happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal this is this is a caution to us but notice it's not deception it's failing to continue in perfect love he says they cooled off they became began to get formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they begin to be careful about what the world thought of them this is where I I was inspired to recognize that the seeds of pretense were being sown into the church at that time the seeds of a social gospel the seeds of it's all for economics it's all for social a social clout or Karma this is why they this is what they begin to become succumb to is they weren't careful about what God thought about them they begin to think about what the world or what others thought about them and this is this happens by them not continuing in perfect love because perfect love would have driven them to say how is it that I can please the Lord but instead they're more concerned of how they look to other people and and if I could say this without maybe using uh phrases or words that uh that might be a little bit rough but to the world our love for Christ is ugly if I'll think about that a little bit I got a few um but uh if you really think about it our true love affair with Christ to the world is repulsive it's ugly uh they don't like it though they think it's a little bit extreme or maybe they'll think that it doesn't kind of it doesn't match what we see and uh isn't necessary and as soon as you deviate your passion and your Zeal and your desire away from Christ and you put it into the Optics of things you put it in the pretense of things or the social structure of things you're leaving your first love and even though it might seem to be in the pattern of what the Christian church should be in and though it may seem like well this is what we do as Christians you're one step closer to deception and where that ended up was in the condition that allowed Us in church where they're completely deceived about their condition and completely lukewarm and I'd like you to think about that in your own life how that we make decisions and conduct ourselves weighing more carefully what other people think about us other than what God thinks about us and how by extension we're often doing things and I think this is true uh uh I I I I'll say it I just I feel like to say it this way one of the greatest pressures on sisters isn't in how they present themselves to men but the competition and how they present themselves to each other and the focus and the measuring stick isn't how do I please my husband or how do I dress for my husband or how do I am I dress pleasing to the Lord but it's being measured by the reflections and people around and there's an overt pressure to measure up to what everyone else is doing I hope just even by referencing that it can attack that condemnation that comes from the pretense of things against the young sisters and sisters because there's so much comparison that goes on and now brother Branham says in the church age book is we're kind of picking up on the phrase that party says Ah it all adds up that they're complacent then he makes this statement this is remarkable to me compare this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that where's the power where is the love where is the purified church that withstood sin and walked with faith toward Jesus where is the unity now brother Brandon identifies the false Unity the coming together the spirit of Balaam and everyone come together it doesn't matter your backgrounds and how when he preaches you 19 sign and time and the time and it's the uniting time he's saying if this is a time of unity this is a time of uniting but there's a false uniting and there's a false Unity that they're trying to bring the church under so when he says where's the unity he can show you the false Unity the false love the false Unity the the pretense he can show you all that but he's saying where's the real power where's the real love where's the purified Church where is the unity he says you can't find it and this is the statement I think is so remarkable this church has all it needs as it says in Revelations chapter 3 why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all right and yet they had far more than they have today they have they had far more than they have today that's a remarkable statement isn't it he's he's saying that in he's drawing this from the scripture then in the book of Acts with what they had received they wanted more and this is no disrespect to what they had it's not like yeah you know day of Pentecost was cool and you know healing is great and all these signs and wonders wonders are awesome but we want more no they just the more they experienced it they never got full of it they wanted more they wanted to be have they wanted they had a Zeal for it why are they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all when they had more than what we had to have today or the church he's talking about the layout to see in church and what I liked about the attitude is that the believer ought to want more that even the book of Acts isn't looking at things as oh this is we have everything we have it all Let's uh let's just settle down on this no there ought to be a Zeal and a passion for more I loved how brother Andrew when he was given that trustee report on all the the the uh updates that have been taking place over the last month I I said as Believers that we ought to have a bias towards growth and I believe that ought to exists within us as an assembly that we ought to have a bias towards more people being saved we ought to have a buyers to the Lord reaching out and restoring those who should be in the house of God and we ought to have a bias towards that uh we ought not maybe to get in our minds and say well well just to be a handful and it's just going to be a few and as it was in the days of Noah and so we just want eight of us and and kind of have a bias towards dwindling down to nothing but we ought to have a bias towards growth and it that we ought to have the same bias in our own lives that that we want to see progress we want to see growth if it feels like it's um awesome today I want it more awesome or tomorrow I want things to increase and to grow and he's identifying this as something that's lacking in the laodicean age he says but it was there in the original Church but by the time it becomes a church age and I'm just going to throw this out there it becomes a church age once it loses its step so when we talk about the first church there's the first church that's inaugurated on the day of Pentecost but then there's also a first church which is the first church of the church ages and that one there's already a complaint against and what began as a failure to continue in perfect love results in not even wanting any more of God so Revelations 3 19 says as many as I love and I hope this isn't too hard of a turn for you as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent he's encouraging the Zeal because they were lukewarm so that's how he addresses the lukewarmness have some passion have some care quit being indifferent have this an interest and a desire be zealous therefore and the first steps of your zealousness he's saying is repent but I want to focus on the first phrase as many as I love he preface if I could say before he has a call to action and as he's concluded his correction he prefaces the call to action with love this is this is not rejection this is not this is this is not him coming down even harder this is affirmation God knows how to discourage Us in the wrong things and encourage Us in the right things and after he has been honest and led with no compliment because there was none and so he wasn't just going to make it up so there there's your idea there should be no pretense there should be honesty I think that's one of the things that keeps so many people Bound in their weaknesses and their mistakes is they manipulate quotes and and scriptures into saying that they're just having a positive confession but really all they're doing is trying to keep up the pretense and they're not honest about their weaknesses they're not honest about their condition and there is a place that people finally come to where they've had enough and they don't want any more and they're willing to be honest because they don't want things to stay the way that it is and here is God he's just being honest you know what I don't have a good thing to say about you and so I'm going to tell you all the things I see I'm going to lay it out there but he says as many as I love he reminds them that this rebuke and chastening is it because he only sees their sins because if it was just their sins he could just leave them in them but it's because he loves them that he identifies it and so it's very he wants to frame the correction with love and before he gives them a call to action he wants them to understand love this is not rejection this is affirmation and I want to bring it to this for us his love is perfect and this is the love that John says we have known and believed and I want to say it this way this is the love that we need to know and trust we have known and believed the love that God has to us we know the love of God and we trust that love it's not believing it in the sense that we acknowledge it or believing in it that we believe that it exists but we know and we trust this love and if we have been born again this is I want to drive this home picking it up from Sunday if we have been born again we have that perfect love we have it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he he clarifies that he he takes that he goes to those efforts to connect those things for us and and let me say this when we talk about a more perfect union and I believe I know this might seem a little clunky tonight but I I don't mind if it is that the Holy Spirit can just chop it up and lay it all together in your heart and you can give him the credit for it but but if we are born again we've come into Union with Jesus Christ brother Brown said the word revelation brings the elect of God out of the world and into full Union with Jesus Christ so that's the purpose of the revelation of the word of God bring us out of the world bring us into full Union with Jesus Christ he says in the sermon turn on the light the man that's filled with God him and the word is one I love it he uses the singular verb him and the word is one that that's just how one they've become him in the word is one certainly it is it's a product of a union a union between God and man and so there is a union this when you when you're born again your soul and God locks together so this is where I'm wanting to and and I believe that uh perfecting love and perfecting faith carried with it this theme that let's acknowledge the Perfection of his work let's acknowledge the completion of it let's acknowledge the security of our soul let's acknowledge that it that we're Justified and he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified and if he's Justified you he's glorified you and so there's a present state of the believer which is secure and points us to the ultimate Perfection uh that will be that glory and that full righteousness radiating in the full Glory that he is and we ought to be we ought to be secure in that but in the in between is what we're looking at and how that we know that our soul is sealed but yet I realize maybe there's times that I do doubt there's times I am in the flesh there's things that I realize that are lacking in my faith I realize my love isn't abounding as much and that's where we see the word saying let God perfect that which is lacking in your faith Lord I believe help now my unbelief and there's these themes about well yeah I have it but I need more of it I I have it all and my soul has it all that that I have in my heart the Spoonful of the of the ocean I I don't need the whole ocean that's my soul and then and as I recognize that with them I saw her say yes a man that is filled with the Holy Ghost has come into Union with God so then if we if I could say this in the in between if we fall short of perfect love love is what inspires us for or toward a more perfect love love is what inspires us to a more perfect union and let me say this that acknowledging our imperfections is the basis upon which we grow as it was acknowledged as it was written in Revelations chapter 3. because they wouldn't acknowledge what they were lacking they could never improve and so acknowledging our imperfections is what caused what gives us the basis for improvement it's what gives us the the basis for growth if we want to just forget we just want to forget what we're uh our well I don't want to figure I don't want to work on that I don't want to work on that I don't want to work on that then you just stay where you are but if we're willing to acknowledge where we're weak if we're willing to acknowledge where we fall short if we're willing to measure ourselves by the word of God and find out what what is lacking what can be perfected what can be better That's the basis for improvement the Bible says in second Peter chapter 3 verse 18 but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's in the same chapter where he says that we ought to desire the sincere milk of the word of God that ye may grow thereby and now he's saying that we should grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there there's there's a growth that takes place in Christ is the mystery excuse me Christ revealed in his own word he said the thing that's the matter with the message today that might need to be a little him because maybe he's referring to the people right but he says Those Who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened if I could put it in my own words this is the part that's missing you can't just say God thought it brother Brandon spoke it I believe it that settles it because he says something that just contr that works against that period and says all right then obtain it in your hearts hey I believe it I obtain it my heart he says now lay in the presence of the Sun and get ripened he says you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake out all the greenness out of you making matured Christians this has got to be a part of our understanding and our experience I believe if we if we do not understand this even the most basic element there's always going to be a weakness that can be sown into you that can that could 10 maybe a number of ways but this is the way I just want to present it right now but if you think that being saved and still with the Holy Ghost is kind of the the summation of it all and you're kind of harvested as a stone and you're putting a pile and we're just waiting to harvest all the rest of the stones then then it'll either T you'll tend to become complacent like wow what are we doing here what's wrong with all these knucklehead make Believers we need to get them all saved and and you kind of push it all on everybody else and just kind of grow a little bit cold a little in different little caustic little critical why because you've arrived right you're just a stone over there on the piles and where are the rest of the stones going to get here right and you feel like we're just well just we'll work till Jesus comes right and you're just waiting for the last one to come in and you'll get called that way but but the the other side to that is as you roll off the pile and you begin to doubt your experience and you begin to doubt whether or not you've been anywhere and it's kind of used oh well you ain't been anywhere yet buddy you need to get saved again and you need to get baptized under a 2023 and it's just this cycle over and over again where your salvation is never secure and you're you're in this momentum of hopeful and anxious and not the right kind of hopeful you're you're always in the state of well I'm broken but I'm being healed and I kind of find I'm a little bit more broken than I thought it was and I need more healing than I thought I needed and and that's because you're not secure in what God's done for you but if you don't understand what God's doing for you that's where you're going to get cold and so those who've obtained the word in your hearts he's saying there's a there's a glory to be revealed in us there's an immaturity that can be baked out of us there there's attitude changes and there's perspectives that we can gain and there's more discernment that we can share there's more grace that we can have in acting on our discernment don't you believe that we can all grow up a little bit [Music] making matured Christians this is a statement that I know you know brother Banner says but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in God till his words just living right through you he wants to bring you to a perfect surrender did we surrender when we knew him in the New Birth yes were we done surrendering no as a matter of fact there's so many of the scriptures in the teaching is just in yielding it's a total and complete surrender he says just make you completely dead to Yourself Dead to your thinking because he wants to fill your mind feel every bit of you feel your thinking he wants to fill every fiber of his church in Ephesians chapter 3 verses 17 to 19. I believe that this scripture just expresses a more perfect union as he gets gets into chapter four and how the gifts are given to the church that's speaking the truth in love we may grow up into him in All Things and that we might be fully furnished into what the stature and the measure of a perfect man and notice how that he writes this that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith and so by faith we receive that that new birth experience and now with Christ abide in our hearts by faith he says that ye being rooted and grounded in love so this is something that's foundational to our experience we need to be rooted and grounded and if he dwells in our hearts by faith and having that Foundation being rooted and grounded in love he says may be able so this is now this is the continuance if he says that you may be able this is a loosening of an ability that you might gain the the ability that you might find in yourself something's working and something's being exercised I say well I I Christ has dwelled in my heart in Love by faith I'm rooted and grounded in love and now because of that I become able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length and depth and height this is this is uh this is all of it it's all these Dimensions the magnitude of it the three dimensions of it the height the depth and the length is to say let's not just be one-sided let's see it all let's see it for what it is and he says and to know the love of Christ they say well he dwells in My Heart by faith I'm rooted and grounded in love but with that I want to be able to comprehend the the uh these things with All Saints two two know the love of Christ with passeth knowledge it's almost even kind of an awkward way to say it says that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God remember he's writing to an Ephesian Church a church that was in a position to be placed a church that doesn't have the same complaints as the Corinthian Church a church that's in that Exodus stage where now it's not just an exodus but it's an intern and two it's time to enter in and be positionally placed he's talking to them about not just unexperienced but what that experience would lead us to Express is a more perfect union from a perfect Foundation to perfect completion being rooted and grounded in love you might be filled with all the fullness of God all the elements are there all the pieces are there now if you look at Philippians chapter 3 . maybe I I sense that we're going to be short tonight uh well I I I not that I'm getting any taller I'm always always short I guess comparatively to certain ones uh but uh um I mean in length of the sermon I think I'm not going to be long and maybe it's good because as we continue more and more bugs will find their way into here but in Philippians chapter 3 verses 12 to 16. notice what he said Paul says here not as though I had already attained either were already perfect now this is not Paul backing away from his experience Paul boasted of his Revelations Paul was not shy to express what how what he knew about God and how he had known him and how Christ had been made real to him and he says not that I had already attained and he's looking at something some Perfection Or Glory he says either we're already perfect but I follow after this is a pressing I chase after a goal I don't act as if I've already attained either were already perfect but I press I'm chasing a goal if that I may apprehend it that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I remember when I when I was a young Christian and I studied this I just was seeking the Lord trying to understand and and it's how he expresses it is I know that he knows me perfectly that as as I have been apprehended of by Christ I want to apprehend him equally that I know he knows me fully I know that he loves me fully I know that he that there is this absolute a security in his love but he says I I press and I chase this goal that I may be able to apprehend in the way that I am also apprehended and so if I could say this maybe if the risk of making you think too much as we close here but there's a difference between being perfect and being perfected and and what Paul is saying is he I would I could say this and please bear with me he's not saying that he's not perfect in the sense of his soul or his forgiveness or sinlessness or his justification but he's saying I'm not as though I was already perfect so he's saying you know there's a difference between being perfect and being perfected and so we are being perfected in him and so there is something uh we are we are there there's something that Paul is saying that when he says and I guess we'll just read it here further I'm in the race so I'm qualified to be perfected I have every right to to chase for the prize I have every right to reach for it I'm qualified I'm chosen I'm elected I'm secure in his love but that which has apprehended me now qualifies me for being perfected and I reach for it so he says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forget in those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high corn of God in Christ Jesus the mark of this age is perfection the mark that Paul was reaching for is perfection because he says neither was I already perfect and I do not count myself as apprehended this Perfection so the what he's reaching for is perfection if I could put it in words that are that suit our series The Mark is God's perfect love it is a sum of all Perfection he says follow after charity so when he says but I follow after he's falling for something that is perfect it's it's God's perfect knowledge it's his perfect Faith it's his perfect love it's the sum of all perfection the mark that Paul was reaching for was not to be born again the mark that he was reaching for was not to be sealed with the Holy Ghost but it was to enjoy the fullness of the new life that had been deposited into him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I don't get comfortable I don't get complacent I don't relax in the sense that I I'm not desirous of more that I I don't I don't slack in my understanding that there's more that God can reveal and there's more that God wants to show me I don't slack and understanding it though I could say I have perfect love and that he has loved me perfectly I recognize that I love him perfectly I recognize that I know imperfectly I recognize that I'm not always patient perfectly I'm not always kind perfectly and so he recogn he could recognize that where his love is perfect and it perfectly dwells in me that there's still an expression in the manifestation of this life on the inside of me that I desire to see Rise up to the top I I hope that I'm speaking to those who who are willing to acknowledge their weaknesses willing to acknowledge that they make mistakes willing to understand that there's more that we could grow into that there's more that that he has in store for us in his word and that we don't want to leave any promises left unfulfilled we don't want to leave we don't want any blessings being held back up in heaven that we want more from him that we want we want it all from him and that we recognize that we can be better Christians and I don't say this from a position of poverty I expressed this from a position of wealth in that we have it so that we're not begging for what's been given we recognize if this is what I have then I want it to I want to I want the benefits of it I know what if I don't want to live bound to anxiety I don't always I don't want to wrestle with the overwhelming sense of jealousy I don't always want to be suspicious I don't want to be succumb to these uh these cycles and I don't want to always be bound by certain things I believe and and I've had the experiences as of late where God has just put me in certain situations and counseling where I could look uh sons of God in the eye or I could look people in the eye and say I want you to know that God is able and that you don't have to live forever in some sort of cycle of Victory and defeat Victory and defeat but God's word is Promised total Deliverance total healing and that whether it be family strains or whether it be physical sickness that we can live above these things I trust that there is a desire in US that yes I have the Holy Ghost but with the scripture speaking of is not to resolve over and over again that you've been born again but to enjoy the fullness of that life that is inside of you to reap the benefits of the promise of it all the potential of it even in second Corinthians chapter seven we're talking about perfecting love and perfecting Faith a more perfect union he speaks of perfecting Holiness in the fear of God you'll find it over and over and over again there's just there's something that you look at from a Heavenly perspective and you say it's perfect but then when you flip it over from an Earthly perspective it's perfecting when we look at it from a Heavenly perspective complete finished it's already done it's over you're completely healed you're perfect new body theophy you name it it's all there from an eternal perspective but when you flip it back over it's perfecting but what is it leading what is it moving towards whatever that image is on the other side it's perfecting it's getting better brother Adam uses the image of the the shadow coming together I want you to think about those things in your mind we want I want you to think in terms of I I don't want to always judge Myself by this is what this is what's perfect and I don't have it so I'm then I'm not there yet that I must not have even begun or discourage yourself no flip it over you're coming to it it's perfecting so he says let us therefore as many as be perfect verse 15. let us therefore as many as be perfect wait what seems to be an odd statement but as even as many as art mature to be any mature ones amongst us if there be any ones that are seasoned as many as be perfect be thus minded and not knowing necessarily Paul's language if he's kind of saying well I'm not perfect but for those who are you should be thinking the same way I am he says I don't pretend to be perfect I press I'm pressing towards the mark for the prize I I I'm following after very very hard I'm chasing I'm pursuing Perfection and he says and if you are and I'm just kind of suggesting this that I don't know if Paul is saying you know what if you think you're perfect you should still be pursuing more perfection if you think you've arrived you should be wanting to arrive even deeper but I like to read it this way as many as are mature be thus minded and if anything you'd be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you this is important to always be thirsty to always be hungry I was thinking of how that Saul that the sins of Saul he forgot what God had taken them from that there's a there's a there's a there's a danger for believers is forgetting the process and maybe they just look one day and they're like you know what I'm not too bad this is pretty good this is good stuff and you forget that it's been him and his love all along taking off that rough spots Tim that's blessing it's him that's growing it's him that's encouraging so he says let's keep this mind and then verse 16. this to me is so so powerful nevertheless where unto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing in other words don't lose the ground You've Won to whatever extent we've already obtained as Paul is saying I press toward the Mark I'm reaching forth I'm following after if he was to say forget those things which are behind I'll leave them behind I'm pressing towards I'm going forward he then says if as many as be mature think this way and he's this language to what extent we've already attained mind the same rule lest we lose what we've won don't give up the ground you presently possess that's what happens when you stand still do you realize as Christians there's no emergency break there's no Park right I can't just say man this has just been exhausting we're just going to hold right here and you may feel that you are but if you ever looked up in the spiritual stream things are just passing right by you because you can't stand still in Christ there's always some slippage there's always some some moving back there's always something that's being lost he says to the extent you've gained to the extent you've moved forward if you possess don't get slacked don't get complacent lest you lose lose what you already possess and so I expressed it in the sense to say that I would never want to diminish the glory that's been revealed in you I would never want to diminish the victories that Christ has accomplished in you I would never want to make the mistake of saying something that would tarnish the power of God that resides within us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I say whatever Perfection you presently possess do not become complacent with it but walk by the same rule that I press on that I go forward that there's more if you could hold this scripture in your hearts over the next couple weeks I'm looking forward to the ministry on this Sunday brother Aaron Oglesby Wednesday brother uh Reginald been David Platt ministering but in in the interim think about the scripture this has been at the core of perfect love for me Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind if I could say Lord I love you with my soul that there's a love that's so real in my soul for you but Lord I Want to Love You Not only just with My Soul but with my mind with my heart with an entire love and uh Lord I Want My Heart my soul is fused my soul is locked together it's one but Lord I want my whole heart to be United With Your Love I want it to be see I I want whatever whatever that condition of my soul is in Lord that that my soul because you know when you tap into that the peace you have you know the joy you have you know those moments when you have the right response and you're like hey look what I did I said the right thing right that that's what's inside of you coming out and he said Lord I want more of that I want to increase I want it to grow I I'll share with you the this theme I know I mentioned it before but and this is it's a whole series 2024 could be on this that he's redeemed our souls and we know he's going to redeem our body but there's also Redemption for our spirit Saul is made perfect by the baptism Holy Ghost the body is going to be transformed in the resurrection and the Rapture but what he's doing now is Transforming Our Minds there is a Redemption for your heart there's a Redemption for your thinking there's a Redemption for your character isn't that great right some of us have I have have more Walt Disney character than we do Christ Christ character right so I'm so glad he's still perfecting it that there's still a perfecton in my character that's taking place doesn't take away from that which is in my soul doesn't tarnish the glory of the new body that I'm going to have so where I exist right now is a is a Deliverance of and a Redemption of my spirit from all the scars and complexes sewn into me but by my own rebellion and stubbornness all the things that have been sold into me by living all the temptation all the failures everything that's mixed up and muddied up in this human Garden God is pruning God is growing God Is So and God is working and cultivating not your soul it's perfect but he's doing it to your heart and why does he do it to your heart because he wants you to love them with your whole heart and the more that he can heal your heart the more that he could deal with the things in our minds the more that he can address the things of our past the more that our heart gets freed up to love him with our whole hearts and if I could say that's what perfect love means to me is not not that I know he loves me with the perfect love I know I have perfect love in my soul but I know that for him that only my whole heart will do that unless he has my whole heart it's not enough for him and that he loves me with the kind of love that I I thank God for my Boaz I thank God for my redeemer I thank God for his jealous love forth that he's he's not willing to leave me with doors closed but he wants all of it and though I may not always act in that interest that he has I confess tonight that I want him to have it all [Music] brother Branham in the Statue of a perfect man and I read this because I want to address this just in a more perfect union our souls are sealed and and that's it Brethren talks about it's already in their Eighth Day condition so in that sense it's already back to Garden of Eden and yet I could express that it's perfectly fused with Christ but there's a more perfect union I can share with him I just I left these things out I don't know if I'll find place for him but remember brother man teaches in the church's book The Harmony that existed between the Son and the father that Harmony exists now in the bride she only does what he wants them to and so all of us right measuring ourselves by that could say I must not be bride right I guess maybe maybe some of us just justify that everything I've done including that bloody lip I just gave you he wanted me to do are not the Fist of the righteous moved by the Lord and maybe we have a way of just constantly justifying everything we've ever said and done but don't we recognize that in the template she has thus thus saith the Lord or keep still and you realize how fidgety we get right how are our our human Spirits get nervous and fidgety and we're not keeping still because there's an image of Harmony that exists between Christ uh the Son and the father that must now exist between Christ and his bride so then I say I am in Union with Christ but I'm Desiring a more perfect union I'm designing that my life can measure up more with what the word says of me that I want I want to experience that I believe you are experiencing that let me say this you are experiencing that has not God been good to us are we not growing are we not growing in his grace aren't you grateful for what God has done for you that right now tonight you can look where you are right now and whatever time period you have to go back to say I'm not what I was then then his word is still impacting me his word is still uh is still moving Me Maybe that's how I should have preached it tonight can we not thank God that this Union is becoming more perfect do we not see his grace in our lives has he not been good to us are we not falling more in love with him isn't he sweeter today than he was before isn't this message greater than it ever been before his word for awesome than it's ever been before because it's a more perfect union it's alive it's living let's pause for a moment and recognize it's doing what he said it would do it's doing exactly what he said it would do praise be to God it's a more perfect union therefore I'm not discouraged that it hasn't been what it should be because I know that it's not what it used to be and it's more perfect and then I want to say this because Brother Band is going to use it as an example the love of a man to his wife they are united and I was looking at this this week how through the marriage vows and Jesus even signed the two the two are now one flesh Paul refers to it and as spoken of Adam in Genesis chapter 2. and so we speak so highly of the love that we have that ought to exist between a man and a wife and there's so much room for the devil to work in that when things when expectations aren't being met and you're thinking are you thinking it's a little late on a Wednesday night to bring this up because that's what I'm thinking but this is what um there's things that I feel led to preach on when it comes to love that address these things in our marriages because and even it's just relationships and it's like well there's he ever met the person who's always talking about their husband it's he's perfect he never makes a mistake and instead of getting more confidence in the husband you're losing confidence in the wife ever happened to anybody okay I see all the the eyebrows being raised like the neighbor in the apartment next door and so there's some that speak in a way that almost just seems like got to be kidding me nobody loves somebody that much right and and we say well love covers a multitude of multitude of sins you're like well we need to quantify what multitude is because I think the quote has been far exceeded here but we If we're honest with ourselves we realize that that love if we're honestly Chuck we realize that I mean okay I'll just say me I know I love my wife and I know she doesn't think I'm perfect but I know I don't always express it the way that it is my the way that I the way that I would want to show my love it's not always it's not always expressive of what it is now there's a lot of reasons for that if you want to get me on the couch we can start working through them but the point I'm trying to make is that should not lead us to conclude the love's not there and I'm not trying to keep marriage counsel from the pulpit my wife or even trying to repair our marriage I'm just using this as an example because it's safe Elliot for instance if you got married there's something to there's does this make sense that if we start to measure the love then we say oh well and that if you love then you wouldn't do this if you love you wouldn't do that but yet we do love right and and we realize there's something that that it's not perfect yet so I want to share this to us who are in relationships whether it be parent to children because when we begin to have children we had never done it before so there's never a point where it's like okay I've been there done that you say well I've got one two two is fine and I think they say once you have three it's all the same no no it's all new Every Time right you're always living in a different context maybe you could have your first four when you're in your 20s then the next four when you're in the 40s you're different right things change it's never the same and so we're you're new at this at every stage you're new so the the way the love is expressed to the child isn't always perfect but what I want to say is let's have a vision that'll become more perfect and that in our marriages yeah it may not be a perfect marriage but I want a more perfect union I may not be able to say oh or it may not be able to be said of me oh man never makes a mistake he's just perfect everything's right everything's perfect but if it can't be said I want to be more perfect I want a more perfect union so there's a template for this for our relationships and one thing that I'm grateful for and and I and I like I say this way that I do I I love I love Christ I want to know more I want to have a greater relationship with him but it seems as if every every time I come to that you you pierce once you get past the resistance you realize I do that by how I treat others I do that I love him more about how I love my wife I love him more by how I treat my children I love him more about how I treat you that that's that's how I fall more in love with him that's how that's how it works because then if I could do that what's what's the other person feeling his love and what do they do they fall more in love with him it's not this fake layout decision contemporary charismatic love that's expressed in in the churches today it's something real and brother Brown says this in the Statue of a perfect man there's not a person in here that loves God but wants to become more like Christ he says it's laid out here and he's talking about the Statue of a perfect man every Christian I'm an old veteran look at brother and sister kid here they're probably the oldest in the building but if I'd ask them what is your heart's desire it'd be closer to God is that yours closer to God I think if we if you if you thought something else you might find that that's that's what leads you to that closer to God when you learn of Christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into him now if you if you're if you're not wanting to get right into them you need to start you want to get to know him more but there's something you learn of Christ or something about him that's so love and you try to get right into him then he says excuse this expression I told my wife here not long ago both getting old and I said to her I said do you love me like you used to she said I certainly do and I said you know I love you so much until I'd like to take you and pull you inside of me so we could just be really be one more not that they're not one not that they not that they aren't in love but there was something where he's like I just wish I could pull you inside of me so we could be more one now there's a more perfect union and he says now multiply that by a hundred million and then you'll find out how that the believer Who falls in love with Christ wants to get into him because it's a love there's so many things that have clouded our vision and have only muted it's never it's never done away with it could never put it out but it's muted it and even that's what the wonderlust and wonder lost was trying to do is take away that little the smut that's gotten on it and that's kept the passion from being free I say strive for a more perfect union so how could it be more perfect it can be closer to perfection than it was before could we stand together tonight
