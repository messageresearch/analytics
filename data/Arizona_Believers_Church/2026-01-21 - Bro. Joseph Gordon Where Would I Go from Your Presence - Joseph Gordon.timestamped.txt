[0:00] And the uh title of the thought today um
[0:03] it's based uh based upon this uh the
[0:05] scripture right here in Psalm Psalm 139
[0:08] is where would I go from your presence?
[0:10] So it's a question
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Psalm 139 and I get my book marker.
[0:16] Okay. Oh Lord, thou hast searched me and
[0:19] known me. Thou knowest my downsitting
[0:22] and mine uprising. Thou understandest my
[0:26] thought a far off. Thou compastest my
[0:28] path and my lying down and art
[0:31] acquainted with all my ways. For there
[0:34] is not a word in my tongue, but lo, oh
[0:37] Lord, thou knowest it altogether. Thou
[0:40] hast beset me behind and before and laid
[0:43] thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is
[0:45] too wonderful for me. It is high. I
[0:48] cannot attain unto it. Whether shall I
[0:51] go from your spirit, or wheither shall I
[0:53] flee from thy presence? If I ascend up
[0:56] into heaven, thou art there. If I make
[0:59] my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
[1:02] If I take the wings of the morning and
[1:04] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
[1:07] even there shall thy hand lead me, and
[1:09] thy right hand shall hold me. If I say,
[1:12] Surely the darkness shall cover me. Even
[1:15] the night shall be light about me. Yay,
[1:18] the darkness hideth not from thee, but
[1:20] the night shineth as the day. The
[1:22] darkness and the light are both alike to
[1:25] bee. You may be seated.
[1:29] So we have this thought here of where
[1:31] would I go from your presence? And if
[1:34] we'd go and open up a dictionary or even
[1:36] if we just stop and think about it for a
[1:38] moment, you know, what would it mean to
[1:39] be in the presence of someone or
[1:41] something? You know, normally we think
[1:44] about it is that you're actually in some
[1:45] kind of vicinity of them like I'm in the
[1:47] presence of all of you people right here
[1:50] because I'm physically present. you're
[1:51] physically present and not only does
[1:54] present mean that you know you're in
[1:56] that vicinity of someone right it means
[1:58] to be in the company of someone or
[1:59] something but it also means to be in
[2:02] sight so whether will I go from thy
[2:05] spirit or whether shall I flee from thy
[2:07] presence or where would you go where you
[2:09] would not be in the presence of God or
[2:11] at least within or at least within his
[2:13] sight. Right? So one thing that we some
[2:17] of the scriptures to go along with this
[2:18] about the presence of God is that in
[2:21] numbers 14 uh 21 it says but as truly as
[2:24] I live all the earth shall be filled
[2:27] with the glory of God of the Lord. So we
[2:30] just think of this marvelous thing right
[2:31] here in the entire earth filled with the
[2:33] glory of the Lord. I tell you what, as
[2:35] the heart of believers, that's just
[2:37] something that would even thrill us to
[2:38] even have that scripture declaring that
[2:40] right there, right? Because it's
[2:42] something that we so long for, right? Is
[2:44] the presence of God because we have
[2:46] things come upon us, things that squeeze
[2:48] us, things that oppress us. Is that it
[2:51] makes that feeling of that presence go
[2:53] away from us to the point to where
[2:54] brother Brandon would even preach a
[2:55] sermon, the presence of God
[2:57] unrecognized. But one of the things for
[2:59] us to believe is to realize is that
[3:00] despite what we feel or despite what we
[3:02] are oppressed and squeezed by, his
[3:05] presence is always there. Though maybe
[3:07] in our mortal flesh, we may not sense it
[3:09] or recognize it or whatn not, but he's
[3:12] there for us. Uh in Psalms 72:19, it
[3:16] says, "And blessed be his glorious name
[3:18] forever, and let the whole earth be
[3:20] filled with his glory. Amen and amen."
[3:23] 1st Chronicles 16:27, "Glory and honor
[3:27] are in his presence. Strength and
[3:29] gladness are in his place." And
[3:31] finishing up with Psalm 16:11, it says,
[3:34] "Thou wil show me the path of life, and
[3:37] thy presence is fullness of joy. At thy
[3:40] right hand there are pleasures forever
[3:41] more." So, we can just go from even our
[3:44] personal experience and taking in the
[3:46] words of life right here in the
[3:48] scripture. We can see what a blessed
[3:49] thing it is for us as believers to be in
[3:51] the presence of the Lord. the glory of
[3:53] the Lord filling the whole earth. You
[3:56] know, there is uh there's glory and
[3:58] honor in his presence. He'll show us the
[4:01] path of life. There's fullness of joy in
[4:03] his presence. You know, at our right
[4:05] hand, there are pleasures of ever more.
[4:06] And we just see all these things just
[4:08] listed out in scripture to the point to
[4:10] where you wonder why would any mortal
[4:12] even desire to go out of the presence of
[4:14] the Lord. But it's a very strange and
[4:16] curious thing about us as human beings.
[4:18] It has to do with the nature that we're
[4:20] born uh with. something that God has to
[4:22] change out himself to give us a new
[4:24] spirit and a and a new heart, right? And
[4:26] put his spirit within us. Because
[4:28] despite these things, it's in the nature
[4:30] of man to not go to God, but to flee
[4:32] from him. As strange that as that is,
[4:35] here's the one who has life, who has
[4:37] joy, who has gladness, who has goodness.
[4:39] Every good thing that you can think of,
[4:41] right, that is wholesome and is not
[4:43] wicked comes from this great fountain of
[4:45] life. But there's just something in the
[4:46] nature of man when just the nature he's
[4:49] born with just just wants to flee right
[4:51] right by that. Right? It's almost like
[4:53] someone almost cutting off their own
[4:54] nose just just because it just the the
[4:57] thing that hits them. Right? Why? That's
[4:59] good. That's bad for you, right? That's
[5:00] not good. It's hurtful. It's painful.
[5:02] But that's the very nature of man is to
[5:04] run away from the very thing that would
[5:06] help him. And we even see this is that
[5:08] it's normally man leaving the presence
[5:10] of God and not God leaving man. to kind
[5:14] of qualify that because it sounds
[5:15] strange because your mind might go to a
[5:17] couple of examples like for instance
[5:18] Saul and the presence of God leaving
[5:20] Saul. True. That's exactly right. The
[5:22] presence of God leaving Saul. But if you
[5:24] stop and think about for a moment who
[5:26] left who first. It was Saul departing
[5:29] from God. So really who departed from
[5:31] who? It was Saul departing from the word
[5:33] of the Lord.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; It was departing from the commandments
[5:35] of God. And that's the reason why God
[5:37] pulled back from him. The nation of
[5:39] Israel. We can see why did God or uh
[5:42] when the ark was captured and and uh and
[5:45] uh I forget which one of the priests
[5:47] when his child was born the mother named
[5:48] him Kabad. The glory of God has
[5:50] departed. Really? Why did the glory of
[5:52] God departed? Because they were the ones
[5:55] who departed from the law. They departed
[5:56] from the Lord and the because of that as
[5:59] a result of the consequence God pulled
[6:01] back from him. So some more examples of
[6:05] that. For instance, if we let's uh deal
[6:07] with Cain for a little bit. We're
[6:09] dealing with this thought of man leaving
[6:10] the presence of God. Now, this is a
[6:12] really curious one. If you're not too uh
[6:15] careful, uh you'll end up skipping over
[6:16] these scriptures, but we have Cain. You
[6:19] know, he's the twin uh the older twin
[6:21] brother of uh of Abel. You know, his
[6:24] father is the serpent, not Adam. And
[6:25] then we have Abel, whose uh father is um
[6:28] is uh Adam and not the serpent. And we
[6:31] see these two sons, they uh they grow
[6:33] up. One has a nature and the longing to
[6:35] serve God in just the way that's
[6:37] revealed to him. and what's shown to him
[6:39] giving a blood sacrifice and Cain what's
[6:41] in his heart. Well, to reject that and
[6:44] to go his own way and to present what?
[6:46] Fruit of the field. Now, here's the
[6:48] curious thing right here is that even
[6:50] though his father is the serpent and he
[6:53] has that nature in him, God in his grace
[6:55] and his mercy even reaches out and deals
[6:58] with Cain. I don't know if maybe if
[7:00] you've read this uh recently or whatnot
[7:02] or even remember this, but here's some
[7:05] incredible things. even God himself
[7:07] reaching up to Cain, this literal seed
[7:09] of the serpent. It says in Genesis 4 6
[7:12] and 7, "And the Lord said unto Cain, why
[7:15] aren't there a wroth? And why is that
[7:17] countenance fallen?" The reason why Cain
[7:19] was wroth is that he seen that Abel's
[7:21] sacrifice was accepted and his was
[7:24] rejected. So that made him really upset
[7:25] and really angry, right? Angry in his
[7:27] countenance. But here's the incredible
[7:29] thing is that God in his fornowledge
[7:32] knowing who this man is, who his father
[7:35] is, knowing what this man will do and
[7:37] reject him and even murdering his
[7:39] brother, we see how God even deals with
[7:41] this literal sea of the serpent. Why do
[7:43] I like this example so much is that it's
[7:46] a good thing, an example and a lesson
[7:47] for us believers on how we deal with
[7:49] people in the world. We just don't
[7:51] reject them and push them away, right?
[7:53] We treat each and every single
[7:55] individual as if they have the potential
[7:57] to receive the word that we have been
[7:58] given and we present it to them. Now, of
[8:01] course, you know, God will deal with you
[8:02] on actually how to interact with them.
[8:05] But that's the attitude we have is that
[8:06] is that we're not trying to figure out,
[8:08] you know, is this seed of God or seed of
[8:10] the serpent? No, we push that away. God
[8:13] wants us to have the attitude of to deal
[8:14] with each and every individual on the
[8:16] same playing field because that's what
[8:18] God did himself to this literal seed of
[8:20] the serpent Cain. And he said in verse 7
[8:23] of chapter 4 in Genesis, if thou dost
[8:25] swell, shalt thou not be accepted. And
[8:28] if thou dost not will, sin lith at the
[8:30] door. And unto thee shall be his desire,
[8:33] and thou shalt rule over him. So you
[8:36] even see this offer right here is that
[8:39] is that God himself in such grace and
[8:42] mercy to Cain, right? Wasn't even saying
[8:45] that you even have to understand what
[8:47] you're doing. You don't even have to
[8:48] have a revelation. You just have to do
[8:50] what I said. Ju just just follow what
[8:52] I'm doing. Just obey the literal word
[8:54] that I am telling you. And not only
[8:56] that, but he told him promised him that
[8:59] Abel that he would rule over his brother
[9:01] Abel. Such grace and mercy that God
[9:04] offered to this man Cain, right? And so
[9:07] just one thing I really like about this
[9:09] because that that's the same thing for
[9:11] us believers of those that we interact
[9:12] with, right? That grace and that mercy,
[9:15] that spirit of God, that life that's
[9:16] within us, right? We're just willing to
[9:18] offer it. is is that you know what just
[9:20] just come just believe you don't
[9:22] understand it that's fine just have
[9:24] respect to it in fact we can even see in
[9:27] scripture what respect for the word of
[9:29] god will do for a person one of my
[9:31] favorite examples of that is of the
[9:33] sarapheneician woman is that here we
[9:35] have Christ who is he first sent to he
[9:37] sent to the lost sheep of the house of
[9:39] Israel he's not even sent to the
[9:40] gentiles the time the door to the
[9:42] gentiles is closed well it's not closed
[9:45] like it was open but it's not even open
[9:46] yet and here we have this gentile
[9:48] Gentile woman in one hand coming out of
[9:51] season to Christ himself addressing him
[9:53] wrong. She addresses him as the son of
[9:56] David. He is son of David but not son of
[9:58] David to her.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; If you notice blind Barnameus didn't get
[10:02] uh did not get rebuked. He was an
[10:03] Israelite. He was blind. He was and he
[10:06] called him thou son of David. Have mercy
[10:08] upon me. That was correct. He is a Jew.
[10:10] He was son of David uh to him but not to
[10:14] this gentile woman. And not only that,
[10:16] but when he she comes to plead her cause
[10:19] and to get healing for her daughter and
[10:22] she actually starts uh drops the son of
[10:24] David part and addresses him as Lord.
[10:26] But then what is his first response? His
[10:29] first response is not welcome. I will
[10:30] address your need. His first response to
[10:32] her is one of a harsh rebuke calling her
[10:34] a dog. Right? Could you imagine right if
[10:37] you would come to someone who could help
[10:39] you uh maybe pray for you or do
[10:41] something to you and the first thing
[10:42] they would call you is a dog. I'm not
[10:44] sent to you dogs. That would be quite
[10:46] shocking to each and every one of us.
[10:48] And I know if that was me myself, it
[10:50] would set me back for a moment and I'd
[10:52] have to recalibrate my thinking because
[10:54] it's like, wow. Because that is, you
[10:57] know, we have dogs as pets. But if you
[10:59] take it back in the time, you know,
[11:02] being called a dog is a very, very low
[11:04] and degrading thing. But if you notice,
[11:07] what did this woman do? She actually had
[11:09] respect for the word. And what did it do
[11:11] to her? It released life to her. She
[11:13] acknowledged that he was correct. She
[11:14] said that that's true. I'm a dog. Right?
[11:18] And so what do we see is that by having
[11:20] respect to the Lord, coming into his
[11:21] presence and having respect to his word
[11:23] regardless of what he calls you, you
[11:26] know, you're a you're a sinner, you're a
[11:28] rascal has to go make things right.
[11:30] You've done so many dirty deeds. You
[11:32] have, you know, you have to go make
[11:34] things right. What? You have two things.
[11:37] A person would reject that. What? It'd
[11:39] be death to them. But if they say, you
[11:41] know, Lord, you're right. I've done
[11:42] many, many evil and terrible things and
[11:45] I'll go do my best to make every single
[11:47] thing I know to make right make it
[11:48] right. You know what that would do? That
[11:50] releases life to you because you come
[11:52] into his presence and you acknowledging
[11:54] the word is right regardless of what it
[11:56] tells you. So to read this out of uh the
[12:00] sermon all all the days of the life
[12:01] brother Brandham tells us it says and
[12:03] when men today try to say that they
[12:05] don't have to have the Holy Ghost today
[12:07] that you can see what kind of a state
[12:09] that man is in. He wants to be religious
[12:12] though, but he wants it in his own way.
[12:15] And he's so much like Cain. Cain wanted
[12:17] to be religious. So he went and made his
[12:19] own religion. And when he did, he
[12:21] brought it before God was something like
[12:23] this. Here's the best I got. This is all
[12:26] I can do about it. Now take it or leave
[12:28] it. Right? So where did he get that
[12:31] nature from? From his father or the
[12:32] serpent. But despite having that nature
[12:35] in him, God still dealt with him. God
[12:38] still put him through the process giving
[12:40] him the opportunity to accept and to
[12:42] reject because one thing to think of in
[12:44] scripture we have fornowledge and we
[12:47] have predestination but don't think that
[12:49] those do away with the process that the
[12:51] process that you and I still have to go
[12:53] through a good example of this if you
[12:56] look at our the Lord Jesus Christ coming
[12:58] up through his crucifixion
[13:00] we see the great prophecy in Genesis
[13:02] 3:15 that the seed of the woman would
[13:05] crush the he his heel would crush the
[13:07] head of the serpent and the serpent
[13:09] would bruise his heel, right? And then
[13:11] all the prophecies coming down through
[13:12] the great stream of time through the Old
[13:14] Testament. But then we get through this
[13:16] great crucial hour, this climax, a
[13:18] single point in time. We see Christ
[13:21] agonizing in the garden of Gethsemane.
[13:23] He's he's fornown to go to the cross,
[13:26] right? He's predestinated to come
[13:28] through this, but it comes to that great
[13:29] crucial time. And we even see Christ is
[13:31] that father if it be if it could be by
[13:35] your will I could bypass this. Please
[13:37] let me do it. I know it was quite the
[13:39] literal words but that's the context
[13:41] right there. Right. Just just think
[13:42] about that right there. Why? Because
[13:44] despite that fornowledge and
[13:46] predestination still have to go through
[13:48] that process. Now God knowing through
[13:50] the stream of time knowing what would
[13:52] happen what would unfold but still you
[13:55] and I we still have to go through that
[13:56] process. There's decisions that we have
[13:58] to make to where even you can find in
[14:00] the message brother Brandham even saying
[14:01] is that God doesn't make all of our
[14:03] decisions for us.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; And not only that, but he said talking
[14:06] about laying down evil spirits. He said,
[14:08] "I want to get rid of this evil spirit
[14:10] on me." Well, you have to be willing to
[14:11] lay it down. There are things, there are
[14:13] decisions, there are things that you and
[14:15] I must do. Though fornown, though
[14:17] predestinated, we have things to do.
[14:20] It's not pushing us through a pipe,
[14:22] right? But it's us overcoming. Because
[14:25] it says in uh Revelations 19:7, what?
[14:28] Talking about the marriage of the lamb
[14:29] coming. But what does it say? It says
[14:30] that his bride, his wife has made
[14:33] herself ready. Made herself ready. What?
[14:35] Getting dressed in the word. So what
[14:37] does that mean? You and I mean that
[14:38] means, you know, we read our Bibles and
[14:40] pray and listen to messages and take
[14:43] that as best as we can, we apply that in
[14:45] our life. And where we make mistakes, we
[14:47] say that we're sorry and we repent of
[14:49] our sins. just a whole full life of
[14:52] doing and action and Christian living.
[14:54] So to freedom for this quote, it says,
[14:57] "That's about the way man does today. I
[14:59] help build the church. I send my
[15:00] children to church there. I put money in
[15:02] it every year." Now, that's the best I
[15:04] can do. Take it or leave it. Oh, see, he
[15:07] wants his own way. That's the way Cain
[15:08] did.
[15:10] But this was what I found this quote was
[15:12] very, very striking to me. But God still
[15:15] loved him.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Just think about that for a moment.
[15:18] Cain, the son of the serpent, but God
[15:21] still loved him. You know, for God so
[15:23] loved the world, he gave his only
[15:25] begotten son. And it kind of even just
[15:26] even shows shows that that reflects out
[15:29] that attitude for us is that if God
[15:31] could love him, then that means our lost
[15:34] brothers and sisters out there, we love
[15:36] them too and just even just be ready for
[15:38] an opportunity to witness to them, just
[15:41] say a word, even pray for them and reach
[15:43] out to them. But God still loved him and
[15:45] he still went after him. That's another
[15:47] crucial part. He loved him and he went
[15:49] after him. What did God tell Cain?
[15:53] [clears throat]
[15:54] You'll do well if you'll just worship
[15:56] like your brother Abel. Abel, come God's
[15:59] way. But Cain wanted his way. And God
[16:01] said, "Now Cain, I've got nothing
[16:03] against you. If you'll just come over
[16:05] and go the way that Abel goes, you'll do
[16:08] well." But what did he do? He made that
[16:10] fatal decision. He murdered his He
[16:13] turned down God's opportunity. He
[16:15] murdered his brother. And in Genesis
[16:16] 4:16, "And Cain went out from the
[16:19] presence of the Lord and dwelt in the
[16:21] land of Nod on the east of Eden."
[16:24] [clears throat] One more example from uh
[16:26] another example of scripture there of
[16:28] someone instead of coming to well
[16:30] actually coming to then going away from
[16:31] the presence of the Lord uh is the rich
[16:34] young ruler. It's in Mark 10:es 21-22
[16:38] and it reads, "Then Jesus beholding him
[16:41] loved him."
[16:42] You know, just to pause right there is
[16:44] that you'll notice this right here, you
[16:46] know, from about Cain, brother Bram
[16:47] saying that why did God do that? He
[16:49] loved him. And we have right here in the
[16:51] scripture in the Bible that's right in
[16:52] front of you. He was the rich young
[16:54] ruler. He came and told all the
[16:56] commandments that he kept. He kept these
[16:57] from his youth. Then Jesus beholding
[17:00] him, loved him.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Right? So that even almost just is
[17:04] another very like uh uh principle is
[17:06] that God loves you, but there's
[17:09] something that you have to do back,
[17:11] right? God is a gentleman. He does not
[17:13] force a decision upon you on what to do
[17:15] and where to go. Now that's not even
[17:17] just completely at salvation. That's the
[17:19] most crucial point because that
[17:20] determines your eternal destination,
[17:22] heaven or hell, right? But you know even
[17:25] daytoday living and where to go and
[17:27] where not to go whether you obey or
[17:28] whether you disobey is that Jesus looks
[17:31] or God looks upon you and he loves you
[17:34] and he has a way for you to go but he
[17:36] doesn't force it upon you. He makes the
[17:38] offer and you and I have to make that
[17:40] decision have to make that choice. Now
[17:42] what allows us to make that decision
[17:44] make that choice is not within the
[17:46] strength of our own flesh but because
[17:47] the word of God opens the way for us.
[17:50] One of the little illustrations I like
[17:52] to give about that is that for instance,
[17:53] if we had these lights and we had no
[17:55] light switches, I would have no ability
[17:57] to turn them on or off unless I went to
[17:59] the breaker box or cut a power line or
[18:01] something. But we'll we'll we'll leave
[18:02] that aside and just deal with the inside
[18:03] of the room. If I didn't have any light
[18:05] switches, I would have no ability to
[18:07] turn the lights on or off. However,
[18:09] because there were switches, I don't
[18:10] know if it's those, but any of these
[18:12] switches that control the lights, I can
[18:13] go, right? Because I have been enabled
[18:15] to flip the switch. That's what the word
[18:18] of God does to us. It tells us things.
[18:19] It lays out a path and it enables us,
[18:22] right? We can make the choice and
[18:24] because it tells us something, we can go
[18:25] and do it. For instance, coming back to
[18:27] Revelations 19:7, that's the reason why
[18:30] we as the bride of Jesus Christ can make
[18:32] oursel ready because the word told us
[18:34] so, right? And he gave us a Bible to
[18:37] make ourselves ready. He gave us he uh
[18:39] restored the the faith, the original
[18:41] faith to us through a prophet messenger
[18:43] so we can feed upon that and know what
[18:45] this Bible says and have the correct
[18:47] understanding of what God meant. Why is
[18:48] that? It's God's word enabling us to
[18:51] make ourselves ready. So then Jesus
[18:54] beholding him loved him and said unto
[18:55] him, "One thing thou lackest. Go thy
[18:58] way, sell whatsoever thou hast and give
[19:01] to the poor, and thou shalt have
[19:04] treasure in heaven. Come take up the
[19:07] cross and follow me."
[19:09] And he was sad at that saying, and went
[19:11] away grieved, where he had great
[19:13] possessions.
[19:15] You just see what a marvelous
[19:16] opportunity he called. he turned down is
[19:19] that here in just the sincerity and
[19:22] honesty within his heart here he comes
[19:24] he comes into the presence of God here
[19:26] is God on earth in the body of flesh and
[19:29] here he gives Jesus gives him a
[19:31] marvelous opportunity he gives him that
[19:34] opportunity to be a disciple probably uh
[19:37] probably I would say even maybe even one
[19:39] of the original apostles but then
[19:41] because of that love of his things he
[19:43] turned it down you know it's very easy
[19:45] to almost just read the scripture and to
[19:47] criticize But that's the same thing that
[19:49] comes through us through our journey of
[19:51] life. We have this opportunity to come
[19:53] and to serve Christ, right? And there's
[19:55] so many things that we take and that
[19:57] will pull on us and pull us out of the
[19:59] way. I just re even remember my own self
[20:02] a number of years ago and being filled
[20:04] with lots and lots of worldly ambition
[20:06] and trying to climb up a corporate
[20:08] ladder at the company I used to work
[20:09] for. Right? That's not of God. That's
[20:12] the appetite of the flesh. a desire to
[20:14] just to go and to go and to just be
[20:16] something in this world. But then God
[20:19] came my way and gave me an opportunity
[20:21] to be a servant of his and it was an
[20:24] opportunity that I took and it
[20:25] completely changed and well quite
[20:27] frankly rearranged my life to where
[20:29] putting me into a place and moved me
[20:30] into a place I never thought I would be.
[20:33] Why? Because he came and I said yes
[20:36] instead of and that's the same thing for
[20:37] each and every one of us here today is
[20:39] that God presents us opportunities if we
[20:42] take it. It's a place of growth, a place
[20:44] of advancements, a place that we grow
[20:47] spiritually. We never want to be
[20:49] spiritually stagnant and get comfortable
[20:51] and whatnot. We always want to be in a
[20:53] position where Lord, whatever wherever
[20:55] you wherever you want to take me,
[20:56] whatever you want to do, that I'm
[20:58] willing to do.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; And those aren't always comfortable
[21:01] places that he takes us. It's a lot of
[21:04] sharp rocks and hard hills and uh hard
[21:07] hills to climb and places of fear and
[21:10] anxiety and whatnot to where the only
[21:12] thing that you have that's just keeping
[21:13] you is that precious seed word right
[21:15] through your hand of that light of his
[21:17] word is that you look at it and the
[21:19] stress and the anxiety and realizes that
[21:21] this is the only thing I have.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; This is the only thing keeping me alive.
[21:25] This is the only thing that is pulling
[21:26] me through. If I let go of this, I'm
[21:29] done. Lord, I've hitched my wagon to the
[21:32] oxen of your word and I'm trusting Lord
[21:35] that you'll pull me through.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Some of those who went into the presence
[21:39] of God, we discussed the Sarapheneician
[21:41] woman. Now would for instance discuss
[21:43] the Apostle Paul for a little bit. You
[21:45] can imagine what a curious case this is
[21:47] right here. We have a man trained up in
[21:49] the law to where when Christianity comes
[21:52] along, this is complete and utter
[21:54] nonsense and heresy to the point to
[21:56] where he goes and actually kills the
[21:58] Christian and just honest earnest
[22:00] religious zeal. We can imagine what it
[22:03] meant to Paul when he finally came into
[22:05] that presence of that great light, the
[22:07] Lord Jesus Christ returned into a pillar
[22:09] of fire. He come into our presence and
[22:11] we seen one who was the murderer. One
[22:14] who would kill the church and think it
[22:16] was a heresy completely made a complete
[22:19] change and it became the greatest honor
[22:21] in his life to serve this body and to
[22:23] serve this church and not only that but
[22:25] be apostle not just to his own people
[22:28] but to the Gentiles. A people that his
[22:30] religion would reject and would push
[22:32] away. But now it became a great honor
[22:34] and a great mission. He suffered
[22:36] tremendous and greatly. But why? because
[22:38] he willingly bore the reproach of Jesus
[22:40] Christ. Coming into the presence of God,
[22:42] some will come and turn away and it's
[22:44] death to them. Other will come and it
[22:46] becomes life to them even to the point
[22:48] of the strain and the anxiety that they
[22:51] have to go through to serve him. But
[22:52] it's the greatest honor in their life
[22:54] and a great honor and willingness to do
[22:56] it. And it's not just for him but it's
[22:58] even for all of us. Maybe we may not go
[23:00] through the tremendous sufferings or
[23:02] have the tremendous work that great that
[23:04] St. Paul did. But each and every one in
[23:06] the journey of path of life, you have a
[23:08] decision that we make. Choose Christ or
[23:10] reject Christ. Go the way of the Lord's
[23:12] despised few or turn aside from it.
[23:15] Maybe it would be a small thing. Maybe
[23:16] it would be a large thing. But each and
[23:18] every one of you, there's a decision. Go
[23:20] into the presence of God or to go away
[23:22] from it.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[23:24] &gt;&gt; So to go on uh in Psalm 139, we'll skip
[23:27] down to verses uh 8-10.
[23:30] So the scripture also reads, "If I
[23:32] ascend up into heaven, thou art there.
[23:34] If I make my bed in hell, in hell,
[23:37] behold, thou art there. If I take the
[23:39] wings of the morning and dwell in the
[23:41] uttermost parts of the sea, even there
[23:44] shall thy hand lead me, and thy right
[23:46] hand shall hold me." It's just the
[23:49] striking thing here to me is right there
[23:51] in verse eight. He says, "If I make my
[23:53] bed in hell, behold, thou art there."
[23:56] You would think, you know, hell would be
[23:58] one place that you definitely wouldn't
[24:00] find God. But you even hear the
[24:03] scriptures telling us to say, "If I make
[24:05] my bed in hell, behold, thou art there."
[24:07] It's just something worth pondering and
[24:09] thinking about because as we go along
[24:12] this journey of life, we have so many
[24:14] things that come up against us to where
[24:17] we know by the word that his presence is
[24:19] with us, that we have his promised word.
[24:22] But in the terms of day-to-day reality,
[24:25] you know, there's those times to where
[24:26] you feel the fear and the anxiety just
[24:28] washing over you and it's just just so
[24:30] much a strain and a stress. But we see
[24:33] here from the scripture, it says, "If I
[24:34] make my bed in hell, behold, thou art
[24:36] there." And it's something to just hold
[24:38] steady in your heart and mind is that
[24:40] even if you don't feel the Lord, even if
[24:42] you don't feel that presence, he's
[24:43] promised that even if that bed was in
[24:45] hell, he said he would be there.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And just in Jonah chapter 2:es 1-9
[24:52] just illustrates this so well. I'll read
[24:55] the whole thing is Jonah. He's just been
[24:57] taken into the belly of the well. And u
[25:00] and this is a prayer that uh that he
[25:02] that he prayed. Then Jonah prayed unto
[25:05] the Lord his God out of the fish's belly
[25:07] and said, "I cried by reason of mine and
[25:10] affliction unto the Lord. And he heard
[25:12] me out of the belly uh and he heard me.
[25:15] Out of the belly of hell, cried I, and
[25:17] thou heardest my voice. [clears throat]
[25:20] For thou had for thou hastest cast me
[25:23] into the deep, in the midst of the sea,
[25:25] and the floods can pass me about. All
[25:28] thy billows and thy waves pass over me.
[25:31] Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight.
[25:33] Yet will I look uh again toward thy holy
[25:36] temple. The waters can pass me about,
[25:39] even to the soul. The depth closed me
[25:42] round about. The weeds were wrapped
[25:44] about my head. I went down to the
[25:47] bottoms of the mountains. The earth with
[25:49] her bars was about me forever. Yet hast
[25:52] thou brought up my life from corruption,
[25:54] oh Lord my God. When my soul fainted
[25:57] within me, I remembered the Lord, and my
[25:59] prayer came in unto thee into thine holy
[26:02] temple. They that observe lying vanities
[26:05] forsake their own mercy. Well, I will
[26:07] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[26:09] thanksgiving. I will pay that that that
[26:13] I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.
[26:16] And in the sermon in the message, a a
[26:18] man running from the presence of the
[26:19] Lord. Brother Brandham tells us, and
[26:21] remember when Jonah went, God was in the
[26:24] boat. God was in the storm. God was in
[26:27] the fish. He went on being right along
[26:30] with Jonah until his perfect will was
[26:32] done. That's right.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; So that's why you remember as a
[26:36] believer, no matter where you go or what
[26:38] you do, God is there. whether you feel
[26:40] him or not. And there's very times where
[26:42] even being a believer and being in right
[26:44] standing with God, there's times that
[26:46] get so intense that you don't quite feel
[26:48] that presence near you. But we what we
[26:50] see here from scripture, we even see
[26:52] here from what the prophet told us is
[26:54] that God is there. He was there in the
[26:56] storm. He was there in the fish, right?
[26:58] He's there right there in the belly
[26:59] right there with uh with uh Jonah. It
[27:02] says, "If I send up to heaven, thou art
[27:04] there. If I make my bed in hell, behold,
[27:07] thou art there.
[27:10] [clears throat]
[27:18] And to finish up on this uh little
[27:20] portion right here is Psalm 139 11 and
[27:24] 12.
[27:28] [snorts]
[27:29] If I say, "Surely the darkness shall
[27:31] cover me," even the night shall be light
[27:34] about me. Yay, the darkness hideth not
[27:37] from thee, but the night shineth as the
[27:41] day. The darkness and the light are both
[27:44] alike to thee.
[27:46] In John 6:44, it says, "No man can come
[27:49] to me except the Father which hath sent
[27:52] me. Draw him and I will raise him up at
[27:55] the last day." Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; You know, it says, "Surely the darkness
[27:59] shall cover me." You know, even with the
[28:03] seed of God in the believer's heart, all
[28:06] of us have to come through the blood of
[28:07] the cross. Each of us were born in sin
[28:10] shapen in iniquity. And that's actually
[28:12] two different places in Psalms there for
[28:13] that actual thought right there. Right?
[28:16] So we all have to come through the blood
[28:18] of the cross and we all have to repent
[28:20] of our sins and we all have to be born
[28:22] again and have that nature ch uh changed
[28:25] out of us. Says surely the darkness
[28:27] shall cover me even the night shall be
[28:29] light about me. Right? So when you come
[28:32] into this world you're in a mass of uh
[28:35] darkness not light around you even
[28:37] though you may be raised up in church in
[28:39] a message believing home doesn't matter.
[28:41] Every single one of us, regardless of
[28:43] where which family you're born into,
[28:45] you're born into into a darkness and
[28:48] that darkness has you have to come into
[28:50] light. But we see here in the scripture,
[28:52] it says, "Surely the darkness should
[28:53] cover me. Even the night shall be light
[28:55] about me." It's just one of those
[28:57] marvelous things is that no matter how
[28:59] dark it is around you is that God sees
[29:01] you. Right? Even though just a very
[29:04] simple principle that you that you know
[29:06] but just kind of emphasizing this
[29:07] because if it just really just dropped
[29:09] down into your heart is that what does
[29:11] it mean to be a believer? What does that
[29:13] meant to you in your life? Right? You
[29:16] know that means that God knew you. He
[29:19] knew he had a son. He knew he had a
[29:22] daughter that he had to go get and he
[29:24] came to you. That darkness around you
[29:27] did not hide you from him. He came to
[29:30] you. That light was around you. Why did
[29:32] you come to him? Because it was in John
[29:34] 6:44. It says, "No man can come to me
[29:36] except the father which hath sent me
[29:39] draw him." That's the reason why the
[29:41] darkness that was around you when you
[29:43] was a sinner was light. Because this
[29:45] word that was spoken many thousands of
[29:47] years ago by the Lord himself and
[29:50] written on ink and paper for us to read.
[29:52] Him speaking out this word right here
[29:55] made the darkness that you was in to be
[29:57] light to him. Right? Because he knew you
[29:59] and he drew you. because he drew you and
[30:02] you was in his heart is the reason why
[30:05] the darkness around you was light. In
[30:07] the message, the resurrection of Jerus's
[30:09] daughter, it says, "You're a Christian
[30:12] not because you sought God, but because
[30:14] God sought you." That's right. See, man
[30:17] can't seek God. He just can't. It's his
[30:20] nature to be a sinner. So, just like a
[30:22] pig, tell him he's wrong eating sloppy
[30:24] couldn't do it. He's a pig to begin
[30:26] with. So, you couldn't change that. He's
[30:28] just but God seeks after man and man
[30:30] comes to God and when he comes to God he
[30:33] gives him everlasting life and though
[30:36] there we are helpless in the muck and
[30:38] mire of sin and we have God seeking us
[30:40] right we cannot help ourselves as God
[30:43] helping us to come to him and just this
[30:46] beautiful quote right here from the law
[30:47] having a shadow he brother Brandham
[30:50] tells us so then if the worshipper under
[30:52] the law could not be purged because that
[30:55] the lamb was only a shadow
[30:57] and he went away with the same desire.
[31:00] Yet it was speaking correctly to the
[31:01] right lamb coming. And then when God
[31:04] sent his lamb and he died and the
[31:06] worshipper then coming putting his hands
[31:09] by faith upon the bleeding locks of the
[31:11] Lord Jesus and can in your heart
[31:14] appreciate that he was the only thing
[31:16] that could ever come and redeem you. And
[31:19] you'd be lost and gone to hell and then
[31:22] to appreciate his love for you when you
[31:24] were unlovable. appreciate his
[31:26] fornowledge of you that you'd have a
[31:28] heart to do it and appreciate his
[31:30] leading of the Holy Spirit to bring you
[31:33] to that place to accept it and you lay
[31:35] your hands upon him by faith and
[31:38] renounce your own life as a sinner and
[31:40] accept his life instead of the blood of
[31:43] Jesus uh and accept his life instead.
[31:46] The blood of Jesus Christ then cleanses
[31:48] you and the life that was in the blood
[31:50] cell of Christ which was none other than
[31:53] God himself, the Holy Spirit, comes back
[31:55] onto your life and coincides with your
[31:58] body and you act and walk a Christian
[32:01] life till the day you leave the world
[32:03] and the devil couldn't touch you if he
[32:05] had to. Amen. Every promise in the book
[32:08] is yours then you just some of the
[32:11] nuggets right here just so many
[32:12] different details in here. Just one of
[32:14] them that just particularly stood out
[32:15] was was and then to appreciate his love
[32:18] for you when you were unlovable.
[32:20] Appreciate his fornowledge of you that
[32:22] you'd have a heart to do it.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Right? Not that you had the ability
[32:26] [clears throat] to do it, but there's
[32:27] somehow he saw down the stream of time
[32:29] that if you would be offered and he
[32:30] would come to you that you have that
[32:32] heart and desire right there. And on
[32:34] that basis right there, he predestinates
[32:36] you to salvation. Because don't think
[32:37] it's any other way. is that even if you
[32:39] would have a heart to do it, you have an
[32:41] enemy who's definitely bent on keeping
[32:44] you from it. So God just seeing what he
[32:47] didn't have to set up his program like
[32:48] that, right? Sovereign God, sovereign
[32:50] Lord. What does sovereignty mean? That
[32:52] means nothing is above. Nothing tells it
[32:54] what to do. It does what he wants to do,
[32:56] right? But then we have a sovereign Lord
[32:58] in his grace and mercy set up his
[33:00] program that he sees that if you would
[33:02] have a heart to do it. He's saying, you
[33:03] know what, I'll make a way for you.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God is just so incredible
[33:07] because we even see in this grace and
[33:09] mercy of God that even for those who
[33:11] wouldn't even have a heart to do it and
[33:12] his justice he would still even offer
[33:15] them the opportunity. He would offer a
[33:17] cane. He would offer the rich young
[33:18] ruler. You can even go through the many
[33:20] many sermons of uh of brother Brandam
[33:23] even see talked about people having the
[33:24] opportunity and turning it down. But
[33:27] then but God making a special case for
[33:30] us, a way for us is that seeing would
[33:32] have a heart to do and just making that
[33:34] way and making sure we come into his
[33:36] presence. You know, it's just such a
[33:38] marvelous thing and we just it's just
[33:40] such a thing we just should just savor
[33:42] and just appreciate is that God in our
[33:45] helpless condition coming to us. Us
[33:48] having a pig nature or the nature of a
[33:51] sinner loving the things of the world
[33:53] where maybe there's a desire and a
[33:56] something tugging around our heart to
[33:57] serve God. Maybe something kind of
[33:59] longing coming in presence of God but
[34:01] just no ability in ourselves to actually
[34:03] go and do it. That what does God do? and
[34:05] his grace and his mercy comes and he
[34:07] changes you out. He put his word inside
[34:09] of you to what? To enable you to enable
[34:12] me to live this word. In fact, you can
[34:14] find one one place where brother random
[34:17] tells us he said, you know, the only
[34:18] advantage that we have over Satan is
[34:20] that we can live this word. He cannot,
[34:23] &gt;&gt; right? He can debate it with us. He's a
[34:25] very smart intellectual being. He could
[34:27] debate it with us. Probably tie us up in
[34:29] knots. But we have one advantage over
[34:31] him as believers that we can live this
[34:33] word and we cannot. And that's very
[34:35] often the stream of time is not get
[34:38] caught into arguments and debates with
[34:40] people, but just let it come down to the
[34:42] real crucial thing.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; You may argue and debate with me, but
[34:46] what is your life?
[34:48] &gt;&gt; My life is manifesting Christ. You're
[34:50] manifesting argument.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Now, as a Christian, you may not come
[34:53] out and quite say that, but but you know
[34:56] what? you your life will actually prove
[34:58] prove whether it's right or not and
[35:00] that's the real crucial thing is that we
[35:02] come into the presence of God and it
[35:03] becomes reality into our hearts not
[35:06] necessarily reality in our minds but
[35:07] reality in our hearts where we live the
[35:09] word we live it day in and day out
[35:11] whether we're up or whether we're low we
[35:14] live and we live the word
[35:17] &gt;&gt; you know what um that's all I have right
[35:19] there so we'll stop right there
[35:22] [laughter]
[35:24] God bless too. Hope it wasn't uh too
[35:27] awkward for you. Um, you know,
[35:29] definitely been ministering for for a
[35:31] little bit, but actually I would say
[35:33] this is definitely a bit been a while
[35:34] since uh speaking to a group of people
[35:36] of uh of of your caliber. So, God bless
[35:39] you and I really appreciate you. So, uh
[35:43] resilience we come and um I don't sing
[35:46] so
[35:48] [applause]
