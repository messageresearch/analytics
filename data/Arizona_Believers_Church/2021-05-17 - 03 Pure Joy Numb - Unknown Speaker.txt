TRANSCRIPT
========================================
of the year psalms 143 verse 4 if we've missed anybody visiting just we want to welcome you and god bless you we're so glad that you're with us this evening psalms 143 verse 4 it says therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate what a uh for what a dark scripture we could say in a way or foreboding and heavy therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate amen you may be seated i'm speaking continue on the subject of pure joy but i'm taking the um the title of numb this evening and i want to take just a few moments here at the outset and talking about being numb just so that you can know where i'm going as we just read in here in psalms 143 verse 4 when he says my spirit is overwhelmed within me i think we can all kind of relate to that uh and my heart is within me is desolate um i was reading different translations of this and pondering the meaning of this scripture and one of them said my heart my spirit is wrapped in darkness and my heart grows numb within me my spirit is enshrouded it's covered up it's maybe even confusing even maybe aloof to me or i'm unable to even figure it out or it's distant from me my spirit is wrapped in darkness and my heart grows numb within me i am tonight by god's grace addressing the condition of being emotionally numb or spiritually numb and it's a condition where we are unaffected or maybe unmoved we could use the term maybe stoic or even unresponsive to certain stimulus and i would like to address it even in our emotional condition as human beings but then also our spiritual condition as believers and there's just a parallel there that i think it could speak to you and challenge you and i'm just making these statements at the outset i feel very very directed even very very heavy and i trust that you could um just help me and encourage me this evening as we minister i understand that in speaking along this it may not apply to many who are here uh but it may apply many ways among many different people and so if you yourself can't relate uh to certain feelings or certain circumstances or situations uh perhaps there's a way that you can enter into it in such a way to be sympathetic for somebody else or begin to even understand somebody else they say i was fellowshipping with brother bill ivy and we were talking about something and how that you know many people can't relate to certain people and situations he said i use this example all the time we say well oh we think we can understand this person we can understand that person or we read the bible we listen to brother branham and we say well we understand the prophet but none of us are prophets so it's very hard for us to say that we can fully empathize or understand one's thought process and what they're going through so i realize for some it may even seem to be a foreign subject to you but i hope that we can still all participate as family in this and again just trying to find some words to say at the outset so you can understand where we're the direction that we're wanting to go with this and we can become numb to certain uh causes of emotional pain so there's things that may cause us pain and through life we may experience them with such frequency or at certain times to where we uh we become numb to that stimulus we become numb to that thing that was was hurting us or causing us problems and this could be in the natural and in the spiritual where there's ways that we could be treated or things that we could go through things that we can experience that relate to our spiritual condition and maybe we feel this prick or we feel something or even we're mistreated and after a while we just kind of put our defenses up and we're able to guard against it and we're no longer affected by it we kind of get over it or we move on and this could be through a series of events or even just some a single interaction or instance that leaves deep marks within our emotions and in that process we become calloused or closed off or numb as i'm putting it and so these things can lead us to shut down or to become detached or removed from certain things and over time even that can begin to develop a little bit of a callous causing us as i'm pointing out to become numb to things does that make sense to some of you just even as we we prefaced this in the beginning with these statements and it is a it's a difficult subject to approach so i ask that you would uh please each one of you just be very focused as we speak on this as we poured ourselves in the message of the hour we looked we found these things in the scripture and we feel very directed and certain things that we speak about may seem to be very laser focused or even very specific they may hear it and say wow that seems to be very specific to a particular situation and we might need to be careful as to how broadly we would want to apply that because there's some things that apply to a very specific situation we don't necessarily just take that as a template and try to apply it to every situation and i'm just trusting that god could take the word tonight and place it within your heart where it needs to be and help you to do that so as we've been speaking on the subject of pure joy our identifying how that in nehemiah it says the joy of the lord is your strength and so there is a joy which is a strength there is a joy that is from above and it's not just an emotional happiness there is a hedonic happiness or hedonism or just something that's just uh visceral or in the flesh or something part of our emotions where we just experience temporal pleasure that's not the joy that i'm talking about not talking about the thrill of the flesh or kind of the excitement that we get when we ride a roller coaster or we do something that gets our adrenaline going it's kind of an adrenaline rush we're not talking about that kind of happiness we're talking about a joy which is found in fulfilling your purpose some of the joy that's connected with a life full of meaning to be joyful we to be living a life that is full of meaning and so we're talking about a life lived well a life that is flourishing that is thriving those may be some of the terms that we've used as of late and so a life that is uh that has purpose and meaning versus a life that is just one that is pursuing fleshly pleasure wow or just wanting to be happy just want to experience excitement and i i want to have this and i want to have that that's not the joy we're talking about the happiness we're talking about we're talking about something that is real and something that is deep even in the scripture joy is associated with shalom or peace and joy speaks of meaning to live well or to thrive that's the joy that we're talking about a life lived well in john chapter 15 verses 10 to 11. we used a different side of this last time to make this point and i want to use these scriptures this time it says if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i had kept my father's commandment and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy my joy might remain in you so he has spoken the word of god so that through the dynamic of the word being imparted they could receive his joy and his joy to remain in him and then he says and that your joy might be full so complete joy is found in the word of god complete joy is found in fulfilling your purpose and doing what you're called to do so in that when we talk about pure joy or having joy we're not making happiness our goal he said well what do you want to do in life i just want to be happy you don't you don't make happiness your goal we're not pursuing happiness we're not even pursuing joy but we're pursuing a meaningful goal in achie and in achieving those goals it brings us it brings a joy you don't pursue happiness as an end you don't pursue joy as an end but you pursue the will of god and you seek his word and the outcome of seeking his word the byproduct of fulfilling a purpose is the joy that you get in doing it in matthew chapter 2 verse 10 it says when they saw the star speaking of these sages and we call them the wise men who came following the star uh to find the child uh their uh jesus christ when he was a child when they saw the star so now that they'd come into jerusalem and the star has disappeared for them but as they come back out and they're seeking the star they need direction they need guidance it says when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and why was their joy why was a joy connected in seeing a star there was a purpose behind the star there was a purpose in their journey they were wanting to be led we know to the messiah they believed that they were following prophecy and the stars signified something so the joy the stars signified uh leading them to the fulfillment of this prophecy and when they saw the star it brought them exceeding great joy why they were seeking and following the word it's not the sign that gave them joy it wasn't just the sign in the sky they gave them joy but it was the overall purpose and the objective of what they were pursuing that gave them this exceeding great joy to know we're going a step further in god's purpose we know that the bible speaks to the fruit of the spirit and how it's joy and peace and it speaks to these different different attributes and characteristics of the fruit of the spirit and joy being a fruit of the spirit it is a product or result of the spirit taking root so it's not the aim it's a product joy is a product joy is the product of the spirit taking root it's a product of the holy spirit abiding in our hearts and us growing and what do we do we sprout this fruit or this characteristic of joy now we're i want to just take a moment to kind of divide this a little bit further how we're contrasting we talk about pure joy i even use that phrase pure joy that we might in our hearts begin to think about a joy that's connected with the pure word of god and and it's something that's pure and it's clean and it's it's righteous we want to contrast that from human happiness and human happiness it's just this cognitive state of mind a cognitive comfort in our minds we feel good we feel at ease but that could be manufactured through thought or through experience and that's where the human mind is a very robust uh machine and a very healthy machine in many different aspects and a social psychologist places it this way he says natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted so if you want something and you get it you can have a natural happiness he says synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted this is really in a sense let's just take our take a step outside the realm of god's perfect will this really works out well for humans that you experience natural happiness when you get what you want but you create synthetic happiness when you don't get what you want now that being true about all human beings what we're not trying to pursue is happiness because you're going to be happy if you get what you want and you have the ability of tricking yourself into being happy when you don't get what you want and there's a lot more that i'd like to share in that vein but let me just say it this way our minds can create happiness despite an unfavorable outcome or even despite great disappointments the mind has the ability to process what's happening and say everything's great isn't that wonderful i'm happy despite missing out on that promotion that would have given you a billion dollar bonus despite being uh not being chosen as the drummer of the beatles despite getting in an accident and causing you to be a paraplegic despite being having an opportunity at a mcdonald's franchise and say no i don't think it's going to go anywhere people later on just say hey it worked out for the best i'm happy everything's good i don't for there's not one part of me that wishes anything would have been different a person can manufacture happiness regardless of the uh the ingredients that are being presented to them and so it's an unconscious they call it an unconscious cognitive process an unconscious a process of thinking way of thinking that helps us see the world differently so that we can feel better about our lives now i hope i'm getting your attention because if we can do that as human beings then you know whatever that is isn't what god wants you to have if that's something that we can do as humans is take a difficult situation and put a spin on it see it differently and achieve a synthetic happiness that is not what god wants us to have when we look at a situation to use carnal mechanisms to process things and have a synthetic happiness or even just get a natural happiness from getting the things we want or process synthetic happiness by uh reevaluating things and creating something when we don't get what we want god wants us to have pure joy and it's remarkable we've all we've all experienced this either individually personally we've experienced this or we've seen others who do this and we can as humans we can experience the feelings of liberty and happiness and excitement and and relief and joy and enthusiasm in rejecting the word of god in doing and committing a sin and doing something we know we shouldn't do you look at people and it's like well how could you enjoy that man this is fun this is great i'm enjoying this well leave me alone i'm happy how many have heard that before somebody's in sin doing something they shouldn't do and they say leave me alone i'm happy and we we could say oh you're not really happy well they don't even know what we're talking about to them they're happy but if you've experienced a joy that is far different than what they're experiencing it's easy for us to say well you're really not happy because we know another level of happy but they're either getting what they want or they're synthesizing happiness through all their difficulties and their struggles and their trials because that's how the mind can work in jeremiah chapter 12 verse 1 the scriptures tell us this righteous art thou lord when i plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments and then there's a question this person the prophet wants to ask wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper david asked the question many times why do the wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously why is it it seems that the wicked farewell and they enjoy things and they have a lot of things to make them happy why are they that deal treacherously that do wrong why are they happy so let's ponder this and know that the scriptures identified that even the wicked the unrighteous the unruly those that would pervert the word of god those that would live in sin have the ability to be happy and to express sentiments of joy and happiness and all these different things but yet they're dealing treacherously or they're living wickedly so i say don't be fooled by synthetic happiness don't use what one human the human ability to be happy as some sort of marker that you found the right stride you're doing the right thing you're in the will of god we can't be fooled by the mental biases that we hold within our minds or the even the mechanism of cognitive dissonance which will convince you know you made the right decision despite this feeling of i don't know if i did the bible says in first timothy 5 6 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth we often focus on the fact that she's dead while she liveth but that's just an assessment and a judgment that the word gives and a discernment that we can have about someone living in sin but the person who's living in sin is living in pleasure they can enjoy sin they can enjoy it for a season they can experience great happiness and great liberty and feel very fulfilled while living in sin and express those sentiments that i feel great i feel wonderful i feel happy but yet we can know or an individual can know by the word of god that they are living in sin and therefore they're dead even though they're saying they're happy so we can't be fooled by human emotion and synthetic happiness when i'm talking about pure joy i'm not just trying to figure out a way so we can just get thrilled throughout the days and get a little rush of happiness somehow i'm talking about the difference between pure joy and even human joy or human happiness which can be manufactured by humans a joy that comes for the lord and another one which is synthetic you can make it i'm not talking about synthetic happiness i want to make three quick points about pure joy they're here on a slide for you just so you can kind of catch these uh very quickly when we go through these but pure joy it's personal it's rooted in truth and pure joy is not the absence of sorrow or pain or or or sadness pure joy is not well everything's going great therefore i'm happy so joy is personal and the scripture jesus says i've spoken these things that your joy might be full john 16 he tells the disciples and your joy no man taketh from you so this is how joy is personal he says that your joy we read it already your your joy might be full so not only is it that his joy would remain in you but then your joy by experiencing his joy your joy this is personal your joy may be full or complete that your joy no man take it from you even paul wrote that he wants to be a helper of your joy so joy is something personal when we talk about pure joy i'm talking about your hap your joy your happiness in the lord your contentment we can rejoice when others are joyful and i think that kind of gentleness and that kind of nature is wonderful but your joy can only be found in doing his will for your life so it's personal i can see somebody else being blessed and i ought to derive a pleasure from that and and i should be able to rejoice in that but many times we're unable to rejoice in others joy not because uh we're not genuinely happy for them but we haven't experienced our own joy and it makes it harder for us to rejoice so your joy can only be found in doing his will and it's personal then pure joy is related to truth it's rooted and grounded in truth and i want you to ponder this and it it's going to mean something i believe later but i just didn't feel directed kind of to amplify this and bring it out of the word of the lord but the opposite of joy if joy is rooted in truth the opposite of joy is not sadness but the opposite of joy is found in unbelief and sin it's very important to catch this and i see this in the in the word of god how the opposite of joy is not to be sad but the opposite of joy is unbelief in sin so pure joy is personal it's rooted in truth and it is not the absence of pain it is not the absence of sadness it is not the absence of sorrow or grief it's not the absence of suffering often times there's things that are very difficult but they produce the greatest joys as we read in the scripture last time in john 16 verse 21 that the woman when she is in travail and she's giving birth she has sorrow because as that hour is coming and she's in great tribulation and great difficulty great labor pains but as soon as that child is delivered she doesn't remember the anguish for the joy that the man has brought into the world she wouldn't experience that joy had she not experienced the pain of delivery and so the joy is not that she had the absence of pain and no pain but it's something that followed and we may even we may fear pain there's different ones who have high pain tolerance there's some that in some ways not do they not only do they have a high pain tolerance it seems like they have an appetite for it i never really got the concept between behind a haunted house i mean i just don't have that gene like okay yeah i want to go through this and get scared to death no uh uh nope that's just not in me and then there's things where i say hey grab this pull this it's gonna shock you i'm like nope can't do it can't bring myself to do it oh it's not gonna hurt watch your little six-year-old will do it it's like you do it i'm like no i don't want to i don't want to feel pain i don't have that someone taste something oh this is nasty try it i'm like no i trust you 100 confidence right now i believe you i don't doubt you at all and so we may fear pain and i know that we all fear discomfort but pain and discomfort are an important part of learning healthy behavior pain and discomfort are part of learning correct behavior you have to experience pain and experience discomfort to learn and to grow the bible says in eve in hebrews chapter 12 verse 11 no now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous amen correction and chastening seems to be happier joyce but it's actually grievous it's burdensome nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby so if you're exercised by correction it produces a joy it produces a relief it produces the peaceable fruit of righteousness but that only comes through the chastening or the rebuking and so we see that there's a connection between our joy some many times and the things that we've endured and it provides the contrast and then i will take a step further and express this that there's times when we are we have we know that within our hearts we have a pure joy but yet we are sorrowing yet we are grieving yet we are hurt and so pure joy is not the absence of any emotion or sentiment contrary to the fruits of the spirit or any sentiment that would be contrary to joy in the lord but the joy of the lord is something that is independent of those it thunders when i preach now isn't that neat please be seated now we the first service we took on this subject to pure joy we used this the title invert always invert and in looking at this invert always invert what we what we were looking at in that was how that certain objectives can be attained to your goals can be achieved by approaching how you're going to get there backwards or as you can say well we need to do this i i want to make a million dollars well not how is it going to how am i going to make it but what would keep me from making it a lot of times we think well how can i get rich how can i get rich you ought to be asking yourself what's making you poor right and so that's not it's it's kind of inverting it's looking at it backwards it's saying if i want to achieve something what's going to keep me from achieving it so let me put it in the context again of pure joy if we can say my joy is found in fulfilling the lord's will in my life that that it's not the goal it's a byproduct of living a purposeful life and a meaningful life my life my joy is found in fulfilling the lord's will in my life so then if you're going to invert that instead of asking yourself well what's going to bring me joy well joy is going to be found in doing the lord's will and it says well what's god's will what's god's will we can ask ourselves what is keeping me what's going to keep me from fully following in the lord's leadership in my life this is how we invert because sometimes what's god's will what's god's will what what is god's will we can ask what's keeping me from god's will even if i don't know what he wants me to do tomorrow i may be able to sit down and figure out all the things that i know he doesn't want me to do or the things that may hinder me from doing what he wants me to do when i know what he wants me to do in other words put myself in the position to act when he tells me what to do instead of just kind of languishing the language of well i don't know which way he wants me to go and i don't know what to do and you kind of become real stagnant and stale and you and you're not you're not ready so that when you call you're like oh oh you want me to do something well i got to get ready i got to do this i got to do that i got to do this i got to do that though this is something we begin to ask ourselves i'm going to invert if i know that joy comes from fully following the lord then i can ask myself what keeps me from fully following the lord now this is where i want to come to the subject of numb in galatians chapter 6 verse 9 it says and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap we should the very fact that paul has to express that we not be weary in well-doing ought to be a signal to us that we can become weary even in doing well that even when you're doing things right there can be a weariness to it so the word of god kind of comes against that and hits this thing that may be in our hearts that even when we know we're doing what's right and just this war of attrition we're doing it over and over again we're doing what we know is right that there can be such a warfare and such a struggle in doing it he says don't be weary and while doing because you keep doing it you keep doing it you keep doing it and maybe you don't see results he says don't worry if you're doing right good's gonna come eventually you're going to reap eventually and he says if we faint not and so he has now taken this thought of being weary and how weariness can increase and he says don't be weary because if you stay to it then eventually you're going to reap but he says but the reaping is only going to come if you don't faint and the fainting it means to grow weak or to lose strength is to tire out it means even to become despondent so this is how the scripture is putting this together how that in doing things we can grow weary but now the weariness can lead to a feeling of discouragement and the weariness can lead to a feeling of hopelessness and this hopelessness then leads to a loss of courage and it causes you to quit you're doing well but in doing well there's certain circumstances that cause you to kind of wear down and then wearing down you lose sight of the goal and the fact that there's going to be a reaping one day and then you kind of give out you become despondent you tire out you lose your strength and you come to a place where you just quit let us not be weary and in in well doing keeping our eyes on the goal because if you lose sight of the heart the harvest then it's easy not for you the weariness to bow you down to the point where you just give up hebrews chapter 12 verse 3 it says for consider him we're looking to christ now the author and finisher of our faith and he himself who for the joy which was set before him says consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself he was buffeted he was rebuked and he was reviled and he was misunderstood he says we ought to consider his example lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds again the scripture is actually cautioning us and i think it would be important for us to take a step back and ask ourselves was paul writing to the weak-minded make-believer or was he writing to the believer he's writing to the christian he's writing to those that would say i believe i've had a born-again experience in other words i believe i have the holy ghost and the word of god is encouraging them and admonishing them and wanting to strengthen them and not saying oh you're getting tired well you just need to get the holy ghost it speaks to you in such a way to acknowledge that yes born-again christians could fight and war and have things happen to them that wear them down the bible saying don't give up daughter don't give up brother keep pressing keep fighting it's worth it in the end we're going to god's going to do something great through you there's greater things coming stick with it persevere don't let go it gives us the example of christ and we say well look what he went through so we have to use these examples that would encourage us he says look to christ as a source of encouragement lest you get weary and faint it's saying that there's a mental weariness that leads you to giving up look to christ consider him understand what he went through lest you allow a mental awareness to bring into a state of i don't want to do this anymore i give up i can't do this as i mentioned a moment ago about synthetic happiness there's certain mechanisms that are associated with it i would actually want to put these in a separate category but it's the same type of ability within our minds but we have human humans have mental defenses and we use these to survive feelings of hopelessness we use these mental defenses to to help us survive the uncomfortable feelings and without these defenses uh the things that we experience could have a greater impact upon us or even more damage in effect so it's actually maybe in a sense a healthy part of our thought process that tries to protect us and one of these mechanisms i want to say is numbness we don't like feeling uncomfortable we may like a a haunted house so we might like to do something that gives us a thrill or the a a sense of an adrenaline rush but we wouldn't want to live that way necessarily so we use psychological mechanisms to protect our feelings this is this is something the mind does a human does all humans this isn't what a christian ought to do but this is just what humans do and so we can we have these abilities to repress certain emotions and repress certain feelings and certain thoughts processes as coping mechanisms in order to achieve a sense of cognitive comfort in order to be at peace in order to not to wrestle with this and be overwhelmed with that we have these ways of kind of tune that out cut that off get distance from that and leave it out and what i'm talking about is being numb and to be numb it means to be deprived of the power of sensation or to be deprived of the power of movement to be not means to be deprived of feeling to be deprived of responsiveness whereas there ought to be a response to that there ought to be a reaction but when you're numb you don't have the same reaction that well you ought to have been like no don't do that or you ought to have responded a certain way but the stimulus doesn't hit you you the even the emotional stimulus doesn't hit that person like well man why didn't they say anything well they're pretty callous or they're just used to that or or somebody may do something and people are like oh oh my goodness and everybody else is like you're new here aren't you they've just become numb to it it doesn't it doesn't move them or stimulate them the same way that it would somebody else and to be numb it means you're powerless to feel powerless to move powerless to act if i could say it this way fight or flight has an unknown triplet right a a a a another another cousin or another relative we say well there's it's wired deeply wired within the mankind this fight or flight and we see that as protection mechanisms and there's one thing caused us to run why did we learn to run as humans well to save ourselves why do we learn to fight to save others there was things mechanisms that were within us that would take place in happiness but there's another part of that there's fight there's flight but then there's even freeze i find this happens over and over again that some people the situation happens and they're there and they're ready to fight another one people run but there's some people ju they freeze up i don't know what happened i just froze it's an emotional paralysis that when something happens all of a sudden something triggers something takes place in their emotions and otherwise healthy able to do these different things able to perform able to take care of this able to take care of that something happens all of a sudden they're completely unable they freeze they lock up in the bible in ephesians chapter 4 verse 19 and i hope that you can take this principle out of although paul is talking about those that are committing sin he's talking about a mental state or condition who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness to be passed feeling it means they cease to feel to be past feeling they become callous where if we were to look at this as some sort of trajectory or process an evolution of sin in someone's life he says their past feeling at one time maybe they did feel but when they first did it and they were able to rationalize then they do it again and they're able to make excuses and then they do it again and that voice that conviction that feeling that guilt gets further and further away to the point to where they become callous and they become numb to the fact that what they're doing is contrary to the word being past feeling means unmoved the word even speaks about being apathetic so who cares what does it matter and as paul says this being past feeling leads to lasciviousness and to work all uncleanness with greediness that's a very terrible state of mind this is the outcome and the product of one working their way past feeling and it manifests itself in this ungodliness these coping mechanisms even in and people who we wouldn't categorize as doing these things some of the downside of these coping mechanisms is it can lead us to making unhealthy choices it can lead to even a pattern of self-destruction and the failure of relationships and the inability of do just doing normal everyday things that we're not to do and so in this repressing uncomfortable emotions in order to get distance from them oh that that that hurts that bothers me i i don't like that that's that that makes me feel uncomfortable so you try to get distance from it it actually can lead to a thought process which is negative and unhealthy now i realize in one sense that this idea we say well fight or flight that these are the things that are within within human beings we realize that in both of those instances there's this negative side which like this is part of man's psychological evolution which isn't good and the the fallout of mankind falling like there's a better way to be rational there's a better way to live there's a better way to address issues there's a better way to avoid harm than just this human instinct to fight or flight we really need the mind of christ to properly navigate these challenges and these difficulties and these difficult things that are coming and so this idea that well i don't want to feel that way who wants to feel that way get distance get distance it can actually cascade and cause unhealthy thinking and unhealthy mind and we're even reading these thoughts that would come up within somebody in psalms 143 verse 4 therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me because of these things my spirit is enshrouded and covered up in darkness my spirit is overwhelmed with any and my heart within me is desolate i'm numb i'm becoming numb i'm experiencing so much difficulty i'm experiencing so much pain so much rejection so much so many comments so much abuse over and over i'm overwhelmed so often with these feelings that i finally get to the point to where now i'm getting numb from the pain and becoming numb is a defense against feeling overwhelmed with certain emotions who wants to feel fear who wants to feel anxiety who wants to wake up every day and and be unable to do this and who wants to be in a situation where you're constantly being bombarded with that and they find a way to actually numb themselves to the hurt to numb themselves to the pain in order to make it through are you staying with me so far i know you're listening very intently and i appreciate that and uh you'll say well brother aaron you told us to be really focused thank you you're doing you're doing tremendous and i realize this is maybe just a little bit of a different service but it is it is nothing short of the the word being a discerner it's exactly what's happening the word is discerning now now just to i want to quickly come you say too late for quickly all right then i want to now at this point come to not all emotions are bad the message teaches us that your emotions are what you are we see time and time again how the word of god and the message of the hour was addressing emotional stimulus and things that were happening to people in their past and feelings that they're experiencing so for us to kind of take this attitude well you just need the holy ghost and as long you've got the holy ghost on the inside then none of these none of these things matter we've somehow ourselves become detached from reality if that's what we're thinking and it's like you become numb and you're you may be the one i'm speaking to we've lost feeling we lose feeling for people if we think oh they just need the holies well they just need this they just said there's got to be a sense of feeling and understanding relating to what someone is going through before we just think we can just slap the band-aid of the message on it and say well this is going to solve your problem that's going to solve your problems no you've got to get down to what the problem is i think too often we're just trying to treat symptoms and let instead of letting the word of god really just say let's just just tell me the truth let's just be honest what's my problem and getting to the heart of it instead of just the generic you just need god not all emotions are bad there are negative emotions or uncomfortable feelings that are for our good god uses uncomfortable feelings to get our attention can i get an amen where's our organ when i need it god will use our emotions to let us know something's missing something's wrong all of a sudden how many of you experienced it you can throw a hand up near if you happen you're just going about your day and you do something also and you get this feeling like oh whoa something's wrong stop hold on wait a minute and you realize wow something's i missed that i didn't see that this was i that happened and what is it it's your senses your feelings your emotions god using an emotion to get your attention something's not right i felt uneasy something's wrong and we don't experience that i can even remember in the last couple of years the situation for weeks and weeks and weeks something would overwhelm me and grip me whenever i saw something and it was almost a torment so i got with the person spent time with them trying to figure out what was wrong figure out what's wrong and it took me weeks to where finally after a couple hours on the phone i was like nah something's wrong somewhere something's wrong i don't know what's going on and you kept kept pushing that push that foot and finally it came out and i would have never it wasn't like i had some sort of discernment like well the lord showed me what you're doing there and you need to give all that money back no it was a situation where i just didn't feel right something wasn't right in my spirit god will use feelings even our feelings of guilt or regret uneasiness can signal to us that something is not right paul says in second corinthians chapter 7 verse 10 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of so someone who is not yet saved experiences godly sorrow in order to repent and be saved so you can't say that the godly sorrow was the product of the holy spirit abiding with the heart of a child of god it's a sinner experiencing a sorrow that was imparted to them or caused by god and the godly sorrow leads them to repentance that they they don't need to apologize or repent of but the sorrow of the world worketh death there's an emotion of the world that's just going to lead you to death but there's actually a sorrow and emotion that god provokes or pricks within your heart that can lead to life so there's certain emotions that can be warning signs to us emotion of impatience agitation or frustration or anger find yourself constantly being angry overwhelmed with anxiety a a sense of dissatisfaction or being unhappy and things not ever being able to be right there's things that become red flags and warning signs to us and it's a way that our god is trying to get our attention to take inventory and ask ourselves what must be causing this because that's not a fruit of the spirit in acts chapter 2 verse 37 after peter has thoroughly convicted them and pronounced them guilty of crucifying jesus christ it says now when they heard this they had heard you're guilty you've got blood on your hands you've done things that are wrong when they heard that they were pricked that means they had this it means to pain the mind sharply to agitate it vehemently it's it's used of the emotion of sorrow the preaching of the word pricked them in their heart in their response to the prick was well what shall we do what caused that the word preached prick them in their emotions and based upon this feeling that they had in their hearts and being agitated in their hearts and having a sense of something's wrong we're guilty what they call them to ask what we must do and it gives us the the prescription repent and be baptized how do we even have the prescription because the word preached provoked an emotion and caused discomfort and caused these people to be agitated and uncomfortable and they said well what should we do peter and it was the answer to their agitation it was the answer to their discomfort to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ it was all these emotions i say all these emotions there's emotions that will signify that god wants to use does do you understand that in john chapter 8 there's a woman that is caught as the bible says in the very act of adultery so there should be no question as to her guilt and they bring her to jesus in order to use her as a pawn to try to trap jesus and to trip him up and the bible says that jesus as they come to him he looks down and and the scripture says that he's kind of ignoring he's not even responding to what they're saying and he's writing in the sand and they and they asked again in john chapter 8 verses 7 and 9. so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience what happened what jesus said and even there there's even there's this thought that maybe what he was writing caused a feeling within these men and as they began to hear it they begot got convicted by their own conscience and went out one by one beginning at the eldest perhaps suggesting that the ones who had the most sins to look back upon in their lives carried the most guilt and thought well i'm out of here even to the youngest who'd be the most zealous and uh and the youthful enthusiasm without much wisdom and maybe not having as much breath of sin it says even to the youngest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman's woman standing in the midst here jesus kind of confronts their ungodliness and their their unrighteous vindictiveness he that is without sin let them cast the first stone it's a very interesting discourse how that jesus used that to prey upon their emotions and they let they dropped the stones and they walked away but in walking away none of them repented not one of them said i'm sorry ma'am not one of them were none of them were moved to humility to say lord you're right here we are with such ambition to trap you that we take this woman caught in adultery we violate our law we don't even bring that man who was also caught in the act and and none of them fully owned up to what was taking place when they began to experience the guilt they just dropped the stones and got out of there real quick holding stones getting ready to murder a woman and use the word to as justification and then when they get called out upon they get pricked but what do they do they just drop the stone and they walk off the feeling of discomfort caused them to drop their stones but it says nothing of them reconciling their hypocrisy says nothing about them reconciling their or resolving their wrong inclinations and say we're sorry we were wrong we shouldn't have done that if we sort of using take it back to this inversion if we suppress feelings instead of addressing them if we just drop the stones and run away if we just try to repress it and quiet that feeling or whatever they could actually be keeping ourselves from experiencing pure joy and remember i said this may have just very specific application this may not apply to most of us it may not even apply to it may only apply to very few but it's worth it we can bury something some emotion some experience i would even say even a sin there could be something that we can say or do something we've experienced that's been said or done to us that was very hurtful very harmful we could take that emotion and we can bury it but it's still there what you buried it there it's still there and though you may not be actively thinking about it the subconscious somehow still knows it's there it's subconscious but in the subconscious that's where you buried it it's like in your mind you got something you're wrestling with and you knock on the door and subconscious says can i help you i need to bury something and your subconscious is in there going oh my what do we do with this and you leave the room you lock it you clock the door you brick over it and everything and and you build another wall in front of it and you you throw away the key and you move on and you've gone on with your life and hey isn't that great your subconscious is in there get me out of here what is this thing it's in there somewhere our bodies keep score even if our minds aren't thinking about it our bodies keep score our subconscious can get weighed down even if we're not aware of its direct impact and i i just want to say this and maybe not give many examples i just want to say it in a very direct way feelings that are repressed can lead to emotional meltdowns feelings that are covered up things that are buried things that are just not addressed things that just are buried and buried and buried it can actually lead to an outburst that's unexplained where did this come from why is this happening it could even lead and very and and this this very very real to even disorders disassociation disorders and different mental disorders that are a direct result of someone repeatedly and constantly trying to cover something and bury something and it's even in these repressed emotions that can actually cause health issues i i could share the i could share the science with you i could share a number of quotations with you from the message of the hour that identifies how certain emotions and certain feelings and harboring certain things and things being there in your spirit actually cause sicknesses we can become numb to the hurts that we've received we could become numb to even the offenses that we've caused and listen i i there's no rebuke in that it's not like it's there's no chastisement in that it's it's an observation it's the truth and we do it to protect ourselves from pain one may do it to avoid a bad memory anomaly another may be doing it to avoid a new hurt i'm just not gonna let that bother me i'm just not gonna let that bother me i'm just not gonna let that bother me but this is where i i'm hopefully turning the corner and we see the end in view not only may it be keeping you from pain it may be doing a very good job of keeping you from a new hurt it may be doing a very good job of keeping you from thinking about an uncomfortable memory but it'll also hold you back from joy not only will that thought process protect you from that uncomfortable thought not only will it protect you from a new offense and them being able to hurt you again they may never change so what you do is you come up with all these ways of changing the effect that their behavior has on you they may never change and you change all you do all these things to change the way it impacts you well i hate feeling that way i hate experiencing that i hate having this attitude and listen i'll say this just very very pointedly a lot of times as believers we're so sincere when it comes to the preaching of the word in the gift of god that we're not being nourished we're not being fed we're actually being torn down and we use a lot of defense mechanisms to protect the preacher and not ourselves because our needs aren't being met in the word of god and you know what that does it makes you less able to actually experience the word and it have a positive impact on you because you've been spending service after service and decade after decade trying to figure out a way to keep that from hurting you i took this statement from a book it says while emotional numbing blocks or shuts down negative feelings and experiences it also shuts down the ability to experience pleasure engage in positive interactions and social activities and interferes with openness for intimacy social interest and problem-solving skills this is the dark side of it on one hand this is healthy and it's keeping me sane and it's keeping me going it's keeping me alive but now it's saying that this this ability to become emotionally numb it may block out bad things but it also begins to shut out good things it may protect you on one hand but now it's beginning to hurt you on the other because now you become immune to stimulus you become immune to things that could prod you things that could provoke you things that can help you you're so busy trying not to be hurt you're unable to be helped because of the experiences of our past we can get have this certain fear of certain dynamics and certain powers and certain positions and certain people and things where i don't know if i could ever trust again i don't know if i could ever do this i don't want to do that and eventually what begins to happen is you're suspicious of god when we become numb this is where it gets i'm numb my spirit is not my heart david says my heart is numb within me when you become numb you don't feel anything you experience neither pain nor joy you're numb i became numb to protect myself from pain but now i don't feel anything is it too close to home remember we can always say amen about our neighbors in the apartment next door right yep that perfectly fits them we can't i did this to protect myself i did it because i was tired and weary and i did this to to keep from getting frustrated and upset and i did all this but now i can't feel anything anymore my title was originally going to be uncomfortably numb because my whole goal in ministering on this was to make us uncomfortable with our numbness if it seemed to be a paradox maybe it's true but we're numb we're numb we're numb but then let the word of god immediately finally begin to provoke stimulate in some way to where now we realize i'm uncomfortable being numb i don't want to be numb anymore i don't want to be unmoved i don't want to be unaffected i don't want to no longer be responding to stimulus i don't want to be the one who's constantly warring and wrestling i want to experience the joy of the lord i want to feel liberty in my spirit i want to have enthusiasm again for the things of god i'm tired of being numb and realize that i am uncomfortably numb oh god do something to give me feeling again even if it means i have to begin to experience pain can we get desperate enough for joy that we're willing to fill again and face pain in order to experience what god has for us because god needs to make us uncomfortable before he can give us pure joy job chapter 36 verse 15 he delivereth the poor and his affliction and openeth their ears and oppression i studied this scripture last week wanting to fully understand it and understand its meaning behind it and elohim as he was speaking there's such force and such weight behind what he says and it stands for the proposition that when someone is going through an affliction the poor going through something then god is there to whisper to them than to help them and he opened up their ears and oppression it actually speaks in a way to say that he gets their attention by pressing on them the god will actually he wants to comfort you in your affliction but many times he's allowed the affliction so you could turn to him as the comforter he actually uses our feelings to shake us listen becoming numb does not produce healing as a matter of fact becoming numb produces more damage to heal we must feel some of us are so afraid of feeling pain that will never be able to be healed in order to be healed you're going to have to feel in deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 11 it says as an eagle stirth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh and beareth them on her wings the love of a mother eagle is so profound that god likens his love and his care to that of a mother who looks out over her eagle it's so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him this is the compassion of god dealing with us as those as the compassions and the actions of a mother eagle this is what the scripture is pointing out but the visual in the image of this is so amazing the as an eagle stirreth her and fluttereth over her young to stir it means to rouse oneself to awake to awaken or to incite says to stir if it means it comes from the word to be exposed to be beared to lay bare so here are these eaglets resting comfortably in the nest but now comes a season and a time to fly and now the mother is going to get their attention and she stirs them and she flutters over them and her activity of beating the wings and stirring things up and quicken something and it lays things bare and she's stirring them but listen not for the purpose of just causing a disturbance but she's doing it for them to take the next step she's stirring things up they're exposed and they're laid bare they're awakened they're roused up from their sleep and their comfort and she's doing it because it's time for maturity and now it's time for them to fly and so she has to stir things up a little bit if we're ever going to learn how to fly we need to get uncomfortable and face certain fears in john chapter 4. in john chapter 4 we've been reading this scripture quite a bit over the last few months several months maybe and so it's the story of the woman at the well jesus was tired and he was weary and he came to the well to get water while the disciples went to go get food and he's having a conversation with this woman and he's a little combative at first what do you you know you being a jew what do you have to do with me a samaritan and so he's telling her that i have water that if you drink of this water you'll never thirst and if i give this to you a well of water shall be springing up out of you under everlasting life and he's saying things to her that he later on will say at the time of the feast of tabernacles says the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw and we see how despite her attitude of defiance and disbelief she's still not really fully understanding what water he was offering so he said just give me this water so i don't have to thirst again or have to come here to draw it in jesus saying the hurt now notice all of a sudden how this conversation goes this is what we would we would immediately post uh that escalated quickly meme right hey i got water and if you drink this water you're going to be happy all the time give it to me i want to have it we'll go get your husband and tell him to come here anybody that knew her like that escalated quickly that didn't take him long think about it the woman answered and said i have no husband. and jesus said unto her thou hast said well i well said i have no husband. for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou now housed is not thy husband in that settest thou truly yeah burn somebody get the melo gel for her she's gonna need a little lavender on her big toe after that burn think about it why did jesus have to go there let's just be real raw about this let's just think about we hear the story and we think oh this is jesus this is jesus here's a woman a young woman here's a woman that comes to a well she's here at this well she's just there minding her business she's going to get some water she's just wanting to get water and this guy says hey draw some water for me she kind of smarts off a little bit how are you going to get water you got nothing to draw with you're jew what do you have anything to do with me and samantha he starts talking about a different kind of water and different kind of well and everything and she says well let me have it and then he says well go get your husband and and innocently if she only had one husband she's like well yeah i can get him what do you need him for but no he was on to something we know it but think about how raw this conversation was why did he go here why didn't he mind his own business right why do you have to go talking about not just the man she's with now but the five other guys that she was married to why because the word had to address her pain she was in a cycle that would continue to perpetuate every day of her life because of some pain something inside of her because even if she wasn't conscious of guilt in her mind it mattered even if she was there at that time drawing water and wasn't quite thinking about the implications and thinking about her life and thinking about what she was going through christ knew by discernment that what she had been through and who she was with and these five husbands was something that covered up her spirit in darkness it was to a place where now she had become numb she had five husbands and the man she's now with she's not even married to anymore why she had become numb to it there was a wound deep within her spirit i i i'll accept you say well brother aaron you're you're really taking some liberty with it i'll accept that but you're talking about a young woman that brother branham said had been turned out by her parents as a young teenage girl turnout in the streets was coming to the well and a lot of the commentators uh referred to this that she may have been a prostitute the time of day that she was going when others weren't there there's a lot that would take that line of thinking that here was a woman who had lived so filthy and so foul and had been turned out on the streets and married this man and taken advantage of married that one and all these different things happening that even if she had she has all these things in her young past she has everything there even if she had suppressed it she'd never changed unless it came out somehow she couldn't just leave from there she couldn't just go on with her life and then pretend that that life never happened it would always be there unless somehow the word of god could bring it up and could resolve it if i could say it this way god had to bring it up to wash it away god has to identify the stain in order for the blood to be covered upon it god has to find the wound that's hurting in the place that's hurting in order to apply the balm it can't just be some kind of simple seance that we think is going to solve everything but god had to cause it to come up in order to heal it if he was ever going to deal with it it had to come up and that's exactly what jesus did he actually probably went to the soros spot in her life the one thing that everybody else that might have known her is like don't say anything about who she's living with just leave it alone right sensitive subject we call it a bear trap when you ask somebody so how many months pregnant are you and everybody's like she's not pregnant what are you doing it's a bear trap right you're gonna get it how do you get yourself out of that you don't know how to get out of it now think very soberly about this despite my joke we can have a this i'm drawn from the scripture jesus was not afraid to ask jesus wasn't afraid to bring it up why because he's not afraid of the solution he has he's not afraid of the answer he's not afraid that he can say well how are you doing all says well to be honest with you i'm possessed with the devil you really do have problems call the authorities not afraid i've got the we've got the answer listen but brother and sister we ought to believe that we have the answer for whatever the person in this world is hurting with whatever a believer is alien with this word is the answer i'm not afraid that we'll get frustrated and not know what to do we know a god that's got the answer christ demonstrated this in a situation where no there's no message pastor that would want to counsel that situation there's no man of god that would want to roll up his sleeves and get dirty with that but what did jesus do he went right to it he said where's your husband well i don't have one you're right you said the truth because you're with the man right now and he's not your husband but in reality you've had five husbands he went straight to it it wasn't an off-limits topic let me say this i'm being very real we have a lot of taboos we have a lot of well let me say this way let me maybe provide a little bit more grace we can have taboos and we can create hostile atmospheres that do not promote healing we can make something so taboo that if someone is struggling with it they're never going to get the deliverance they need because that's taboo we can have emotional pains and past and things that people experience and things people go through and everyone else is seemingly living such a perfect life that someone's afraid to say my life isn't perfect i'm struggling everyone else gets to go out to eat after service and i gotta go home and wonder if i'm gonna have enough gas money to make it to church because we stigmatize uh blessings and surplus and doing this and doing that and you have somebody who's hurting and broken and can't figure a way out and we create an atmosphere to where that person can never feel safe enough to say i need help can someone help me why through our taboos and our hostile environments where there's never any healing there's never any settling there's never any peace that someone comes to in mark chapter 9 verse 24 this is how christ could still address a weakness or an area he calls to a woman and says bring me your husband and he begins to have a conversation with her probably the darkest part of her spirit and another man has a child who is sick and he says if you'll just believe she'll be made way made well and straightway the father child cried out and said with tears this is how comfortable this man was in the presence of christ lord i believe if i can say but help thou my unbelief would we even allow someone in our families or in our churches enough liberty to say yes i believe but my belief needs healing that's exactly what he says when he says help down my unbelief heal the defect in my faith my faith isn't complete my faith isn't whole lord i do believe you're a healer but right now i'm feeling very vulnerable right now it's my own child i've never felt like this before i've never felt hopeless i've never felt pressed i'm worried that maybe my sins have caused this i'm worried that my bad decisions have brought this upon my family i'm feeling very anxious i feel like i'm gonna have a nervous breakdown oh god help me help me heal my faith or we say well that guy just needs the holy ghost buried unresolved pain unresolved doubts questions issues can become so buried that it just becomes a ticking time bomb and the only one that knows it is our subconscious because it's in that room with the ticking time bomb you've thrown in there and it knows it's banging on the door it's gonna happen i can't stop this i can't contain it and let me say this in grace just to move a step further for god to heal it he needs to expose it do you understand if he was going to ever heal the woman at the well of her the scar the pain that caused her to live that kind of lifestyle he had to call it out first he's showing i'm willing to take you as you are i don't have to pretend that you're some righteous pure white lily that came to the well a little bit late this afternoon and you can accept the messiah i can take you as you are with your doubts with your pains with your fears with your worries with your past i can take you as you are because i'm a problem solver i can fix this is what christ is saying i just need to move quickly here but just to use it as an example so you understand god needs to expose it to heal it we have to become conscious of our sins in order to repent of it david would have never repented of his sins of adultery and murder had nathan not come and provoked him to feel the full weight and guilt of it through the story of the man who took another man's sheep it probably pricked him it provoked him what it what had david been able to do for months he'd been able to bury it right minutely move back move on with his life and pretend to have everything in order but the word of god pricked him and there's barriers to our joy that can reside in a reside in our spirits but the spirit needs to bring it up and i want to say it this way in order to put it in order there's things about our past that can't god can't change he can't change the past i know i'm walking in a very delicate place here but i want you to understand this we know what's happened and we can't we can't get into a little time machine and go back and change what's happened but we can change how the past has changed us we can he could take these things that are in our past and he can put him in order so that the good he promised can come of it because there's things that god can use but he's got to bring it to ser the surface in order to utilize it is everyone out are the kids out of school now someone told me the other day that college is over how many kids how many kids are still in school just well okay school's still on all right well i was hoping maybe it wasn't a school night and those of us who have work can call in late because it's getting late second corinthians chapter 12 verses 7 to 10 i just feel that i must press through with this because god has to surface things so he can use it now this this instance is just going to give us a principle that we can use paul says in second corinthians chapter 12 verses 7 to 10 lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh so now he he he's using a language is very positive this is something maybe a prophet can do he's so sure he's had such supernatural things happen and he actually equates the thorn to the his abundance of revelation so he may not be able to fully relate but he's acknowledging that there's some sort of thorn that's in his flesh let me say this for time's sake that whenever the body has a foreign object enters the body there's a way that the body responds to a thorn to a splinter something that gets inside the body and the body immediately begins to address it in order to protect the rest of the body and the the sensitivity you feel and even the infection the things that begins to set in is the body's way of saying this doesn't belong here build a bubble around it keep it where it's at don't let it go any further and it'll actually fester and it can become very covered up and there can be something nodule things grow over it and cover it up but in order the body sometimes will actually try to eject that and push it out on its own but sometimes the body's covered it up and it becomes infected and it's covered over and you've got to go in and cut it out to remove it because the body's identified this as something that's not supposed to be there and there's people that live with foreign objects in the body and it's painful and it gets infected but as it continues eventually the body has neutralized it and the person can become numb to the presence of a thorn and they just live with it work through the pain and then just get numb to it after a while and doctors can say how in the world did you live with that people with bullets and their in their head and people with things and their sinuses i remember when i was a kid i lost the the cap to the pen and i couldn't find it and it's way up in their sinus cavity and they thought they just had sinus problems and they always had allergies and and they'll live the doctors like how in the world did you do this i just got used to it it just became a way of life now paul is identifying a thorn in the flesh this would be a discomfort he says a messenger of satan that buffets him lest i should be exalted above measure then in verse 8 for this thing i besought the lord three times that it might depart from me lord this pain this buffeting this problem let it depart from me and christ answered listen his answer is not no i'm not going to let it depart from you his answer is not even saying that no i'm going to let it remain his answer was to point him to something greater than the thorn recognize that jesus doesn't say no i won't deliver you recognize he doesn't say no you're gonna have to live with it for the rest of your life he says my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness can we all agree his strength is perfect and that his strength is perfect and he does not need our weaknesses added to it to make it perfect think about it think about what the scripture is saying it's not that jesus is strong and you've got to add your weakness to it to make him perfectly strong his strength is perfect without your weakness so when jesus says my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness he means in weakness is where my strength shines it's in your weakness that you really benefit from my strength hallelujah isn't that wonderful he says oh i've got this messenger of satan to buff at me he's saying paul i want you to learn a lesson i want you to teach it to my believers that in times like that that's when my strength becomes perfect it's in times like that that's when my strength really shines it's when you're going through a hard time it's when satan's buffing in you it's when it's hurt it's when it's painful that's when my strength reaches its full and supreme expression for you it was teaching them a lesson don't even ask for the pain to go away just ask for me to become more real don't even ask for it god get the thorn for me don't get the thorn from he says no the thorn is there so you can realize just how much more i love you then you realize just how much more of a healer i am just how much more of a deliver i was i thank god that this way hasn't been easy because the harder it goes the greater his love for me feels he says then he turns his attitude most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities instead of desiring that they depart think of it this way i will boast or i'll rejoice against them because of christ i will it's not that your glory he was going to glory and worship the thorn in glory that he had the thorn but he would boast against the thorn saying every prick his strength shines every heart his strength shines every buffet every enemy every attack his strength signs shines and i will boast against the pain about the glory of christ and then he continues that the power of christ may rest upon me and this is where when brother michael was singing peace of god cover me i was coming to the pulpit because this very phrase it means that the power of christ may cover me that the power of christ may tap the word is actual phrases tabernacle upon me not not take the thorn away but cover my infirmity cover it completely over as with the tent and abide on me continually he's going to cover you therefore i take pleasure in i will act well i will prosper i will this is the language i will conduct myself with joy in the presence of the thorn and he says in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong then i am upheld by divine arm he's drawing from the phrase let the weak say that i am strong the paul is saying the joy of the lord is my strength in the presence of the thorn in the presence of the buffet in the presence of the opposition and the presence of the fighting i can see that his strength means more to me in times like this than ever before the thorn could not torment paul even though it might hurt it couldn't torment i say it this way paul didn't need to become numb paul didn't need to become numb to the thorn he needed to always properly regard the thorn as an opportunity to boast he boasted against it he viewed it as an opportunity for strength to be made manifest perfectly to him to experience christ in a different level i'm going to be personal just for a moment with the path that i've taken in my life i have absolutely zero doubt that god is real that i'm a son of god and that his word is true not a doubt at all but then there's things that you go through and things you experience and you're not sure if you're you're you're going through them the right way and i came to a place in my life several years ago where and i remember it was when i was counseling with a young man who's going through very difficult problems and things in his life are just falling apart and i could really sense where he was at emotionally and and i i articulated this phrase to him and i'd never used it before publicly but it was the way i was feeling and i said i understand what you're going through i said i don't know if this is faith or if i've just become numb can you relate to that like this doesn't bother me anymore i'm not moved by this i'm not moved by that but you realize i'm not even feeling anymore is this is this faith or if i'm just becoming numb and i think for some of us we've probably tried to convince ourself that our numbness was faith but really what we've become is numb we've said it was faith well that just doesn't move me and i've gotten over this and i've gotten over that but know what you've really become is numb faith is a sense in itself faith is not a feeling like our traditional feelings of the mind and the body but faith is a sense in itself so give me some just let me use the saying that faith itself is a sense it's a sensation faith itself feels faith is not the absence of all other senses faith can feel when when and when imagination is very robust faith can feel even when your touch can is sensing things faith can have the ability you can see that you've got problems but faith can tell you there's a solution to that problem it's not when all the other senses no longer see taste feel smell or hear or all the other senses are dumbed down that somehow you're able to have faith faith is not the absence or the numbing of all of the senses faith is a sense in itself and there's a diagnosable condition that very few people experience but a cognitive insensitivity to pain is not faith in other words there's people who actually have a defect in their bodies where they cannot experience pain that doesn't mean they're like a superhero or they don't burn they just don't feel it when they're burning it doesn't mean they don't have bones that don't break or if they break they automatically heal they don't feel that it breaks so they're willing to jump off the stairs and they're willing to do very reckless things because they don't they haven't had a sense of pain but bones still break burns still happen i'm not talking about a superhero i'm talking about people who are in the natural are cognitively in their minds they're insensitive to pain but spiritual insensitivity to pain and to hurt is not faith to just become numb to offenses to become numb to things to become numb to this and to become numb to that that is not faith but listen what faith is it's faith that has courage to face that kind of pain faith is brave and it gives you courage to stand in the face of those things and call them what they are and allow god to deal with them and process them and get victorious over them it overwhelmed me and overwhelmed me so tremendously and i'll just say that and if god will help me and i think there's just different ways that you can say it that sometimes god brings us to a mountain and and we we come right up against another problem like i fought over that mountain i scaled that mountain i had to go to this before and we find ourselves standing right back at that mountain and god wants you at the base of that mountain not because you're gonna have to climb it again because he wants you to realize that now you've got faith to move it wanting you to realize i put you right back at the base of this mountain again not because i'm going to make you go through it again but because he wants you to dig down deep face the pain face the discouragement face the fear and this time by faith move it where there's no hopelessness and despondence if i got to climb this mountain again if i got to do this again i'm just going to quit i can't go through this again i don't want to have to do this i'm so weary i can't do it he's wanting you to face it because this time he wants to bring you through it by faith on a greater level i've got an end to the my notes there's there's an end to this i'm coming to it i want you to think about this scripture i didn't even put it on a slide because i wanted you to i wanted you to listen to it hebrews chapter 4 verse 15. are you with me this far i know i'm taking advantage of you and i apologize but listen to this scripture in a different light for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin you catch that in other words he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities it's not that he's moved by the expression by you expressing your infirmities he's not moved by the knowledge of your infirmities he's not moved because oh god i'm sick and i'm hurting goes oh oh let me look at yes sick and hurting that's not good let me heal it he can be touched by the feeling catch that the feeling of your infirmities he's not he doesn't just hear you say i'm lonely he goes oh loneliness doesn't sound good he doesn't just hear you say i'm hurting i'm anxious i'm fearful this happens and that happens and he goes that doesn't sound good he can be touched listen he can be touched by the feeling of it in other words it's saying that christ knows how you feel his compassion is connected with his ability to empathize with your pain his compassion is connected with his ability not just to sympathize but to actually empathize with what you're feeling his compassion is connected to what you are feeling do you realize then just how much it hinders us if we become numb to our feeling and in our numbness we do not pour out to god and call out to god but then when we begin to feel it and we communicate it to god without fear of judgment without fear being stigmatized that god can say that moves me i know how you feel i don't look down upon you i don't think less of you as a daughter of god i don't think less of you as a son of god if that's what you're going through if that's how you feel i heal you too and i say this and i mean it with all my heart by faith we don't have to hide anymore by faith we don't need to become emotionally detached there's a lot of things we do when we do it for our own sanity and i i encourage people to do things to where if there's a trigger if there's something that gets it moves them there's something that happens that really hurts them and i say avoid it don't don't don't don't put yourself in that position but listen i believe that god wants to heal us so deeply that we can take every trigger and destroy it every trigger destroy it because we're not going to be a bride that's just huddled up in the corner completely ostracized and fearful and worried about all the layout to seeing triggers but we're going to be able to take all those and put them down put them down put them down put them down john chapter 4 again i i just want to i'm just going to skip through i don't even remember how much i put on that slide but she says when he begins to call out her husbands her perception is that he's a prophet and she starts talking about worshiping the true god and as he speaks she says i know that the messiah is coming in the what he says in verse 26 do i not have that in there bill john okay verse 26 what he says here i want you to realize i that speak unto thee am he he has said to her what he has not said to anyone else you realize that he just told the woman at the well that he was the christ and he was the messiah now go throughout his ministry and find how many other times he was boldly proclaiming this and telling this to people and speaking that plainly but now he says to her remember the one that had five husbands that was living with another guy that wasn't her husband the one he had this kind of sarcastic back and forth with this is the one to whom he said i am he and it says that she left her water pot in verse 28 and her testimony come see a man not who said he was the messiah but come see a man who told me what i was come see a man that told me all the things that i ever did are you hearing what she said was she identified with christ had gone into her spirit christ had identified something that had even had been identifying her holding her back it was her bondage it was her greatest fear it was her greatest pain and she says running into the city come see a man who wasn't afraid to find my biggest fear come see a man that could get inside my subconscious and bring out what was really hurting me come see a man that can heal my deepest hurt this must be the messiah her testimony that he was the messiah was not based upon the fact that he always had a clever response to their banter about the well it was not based upon the fact that he said i am in the messiah she said this man is the messiah because he touched a spot deep within my heart that only the messiah could touch hallelujah come see a man who told me all things that ever i did in other words these were the things that had built the largest cannon in her mind and what she was identified with and who she was but something was so thoroughly broken that in that moment that she could face everybody that knew what she was and say come see a man who took care of it come see a man who wasn't afraid to talk about it all of you looked at me and you glared at me and you avoided me and i had to use the well at a time of day because i was stigmatized i was reproached and all of you cast me out but come see a man who wasn't afraid to talk about the things that mattered the most to me and in doing so set me free there's no hurt that he doesn't want to cover over there's no past that he wants you to still be haunted by are you listening to me he isn't afraid of your past god's not one of these he's not in a job interview and saying oh so i saw on your resume here that you know there's like five years here where you don't have anything you were doing oh i was in prison for carjacking uh we don't want you sorry yeah i know why you put that blank space there pro tip next time you interview just say you you know became a monk there's nothing in the resume that there's a blank spot where he he's going to hear your your your story and he's like well we need to think about this don't call us we'll call you he's not afraid of your past he permitted it right he allowed it to happen he's not afraid of your doubts he wants to so overwhelm you with his love that you could come to a place to say lord i believe but help heal my unbelief let me say this it may get really uncomfortable when god begins to wash away our numbness it may get real uncomfortable when god begins to open our eyes and we begin to experience and feel things that we hadn't felt in a while but he does it with tender hands and he does it because he wants us to experience him and if you've got a hard part in your heart it's a part he can't dwell in you've got a callous if you've got a wound it's a place if you become numb then you can't feel him there and you know what god wants he wants to fill every fiber of your being and he'll do it he just begins to uncover and expose and he does it so that not only can we experience him but we can experience pure joy if the musicians would come whether micah or brother loyal they could come have you ever felt i don't know if this is faith or or if i'm just numb god doesn't want us to be numb in psalm 51 verse 12 after david had sinned it's a statement that's very familiar to us i think it'll be a good turning point to continue and just to seal off these things tonight he's crying out as he's asked god change his heart and touch him and to heal him he says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation he says uphold me with thy free spirit let a willing spirit uphold me renew a right spirit in me he's saying let it not be bound anymore he's saying let me feel again let me feel again lord i remember when i was this is i'm just articulating as a david now in my youth i experienced a lot of pain i experienced a lot of suffering but my highs were so much higher lord [Music] all the joys i experienced counterbalanced all the sufferings and the pains and the persecutions and the disappointments the lord somehow along the way i i got discouraged in a way to protect myself against all the pain i began to experience your joy much less and now i find myself just numb to it all and lord i don't even feel anymore and he's asking god to help him feel again is there anyone here tonight that says lord i just want to feel again i want it i want it to have feeling in it you remember how brother branham told the story about the man and the wife who had that little tiff and they argued gave her a kiss and he began to leave and he was walking down the way all of a sudden what was it emotion pricked him and he said i could never live with myself if i don't get this if i never saw her again and that's how things ended so he rushed back in and he didn't do anything different than what he had done before he kissed her and left didn't say anything he kissed her and left but everything changed you remember why it changed that time it had feeling in it and we're doing the right things believers you're doing the right things but maybe just what it's lacking is feeling he said lord this time next time for the rest of the times i want the feeling back he said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation his joy had been taken by sin his joy had been taken by guilt david if we cannot relate to the sins of murder and adulterer if he cannot relate even as a we're not backslidden in this condition we could say that we could relate and that david had lost his peace of mind and he said lord heal my joy and give it back to me i believe tonight you can have it i believe it's yours but to heal you're going to have to feel [Music] are you willing to face it [Music] courageously because i know i'm coming before one who can be touched not by the fact that i have infirmities but by the feeling of my infirmities i invite you to stand [Music] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation this isn't a synthetic happiness [Music] this isn't a cognitive dissonance this is a son or daughter of god that knows that at one time i was happy one time i was free [Music] one time everything felt so right but now i'm numb with heads bowed tonight you'd say lord i just want to feel your presence and maybe this is where the honesty comes in you say lord even if it means i've got to face pain even if it means i have to begin to experience discomfort i'm so hungry for your presence lord i'm so hungry for real joy that i'm now willing to feel again hands are raised all over in order to heal you're going to have to feel and i'm not asking us to lean into a difficult situation i'm not asking us to go and embrace our accusers or to restore relationships with our abusers but i'm talking about facing the pain tonight but this time with christ but this time as a woman at the well and he's the one that brings it up and he does it because he loves you not because he wants to shame you or hurt you he does it because he wants to heal you and say lord here i am in your presence heal my unbelief lord i want to feel again i've become so numb i'm unmoved i'm not sympathetic towards anyone lord i'm i'm insensitive to the feeling of others lord i'm not even moved in service i don't get the thrill out of church the word doesn't have the effect upon me as i get used to lord i remember a time when it seemed like i had so much zeal and so much passion and so much joy and life and year after year and wave after wave seems to beat upon the shore of my joy and now it seems stripped bare and the waves don't even come anymore and things are just placid and still and stagnant you say lord if you bring the joy i'm willing to stand the waves [Music] i just want to feel again lord and you're willing to admit tonight that you've been numb i believe god can come and touch you and heal you let's pray for one another our gracious heavenly father lord i believe that tonight many have become uncomfortably numb [Music] in other words lord you by the preaching of the word have made them conscious to a spiritual numbness that has plagued them and while we have tried to use your word like google or webmd and diagnosed and diagnosed and try to figure out things are wrong tonight you've come to the heart of the matter and said before i can deal with you you're going to have to start feeling again [Music] and lord i pray that we could trust ourselves to the tender hand of jehovah we can trust ourselves into your care lord i do not i have not father in my heart i trusted if the people know i have not chastised them i have not corrected them i have not in my heart in any way intended a negative pronouncement or judgment but lord i spoke as one who's paid the price for this sermon that they might know there's a place of rest and there's a safe place in you and that it's not a pastor it's not a man it's not a teacher it's not a prophet that stands over them telling them where they must flee or what they must do or how they must live or how they must act but you christ stand before them they the woman at the well you revealing yourself as christ them being exposed lord and laid bare you as the mother eagle fluttering over them stirring their nest [Music] you is the one who in pressure impressing them tonight you as in the one who tonight have caused people to feel who haven't felt in so long lord i know that we can gather in meetings and shout and dance and we can weep and we can cry but tonight there are those who have felt tonight in ways they have not felt in a long time and lord it must be you that would ordain 6 30 on may 16 2021 to place people in your presence tonight together who otherwise would have never even met but tonight you have intended for them to be at this well at this time to touch their greatest fears and their greatest hurts to bring it up to expose it to cut into that flesh to identify the thorn and say i can use this i pray that you would heal heal tonight [Music] may your sons and may your daughters right now in the divine presence of the lord jesus christ take you at your word and receive you for what they have need of and may we even be able to be honest to the point to where if it be with tears that we cry out lord i believe heal my unbelief may it be done in the name of the lord jesus christ set your people free help them to feel again i pray lord not a synthetic feeling not an emotion not a built up worked up thing but something from you that we might be healed lord i ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
