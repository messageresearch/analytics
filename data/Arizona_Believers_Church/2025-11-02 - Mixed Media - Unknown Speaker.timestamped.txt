[0:00] 1st Samuel chapter 28
[0:03] 14-19
[0:06] and it reads and he said unto her and
[0:08] this is uh now Saul speaking to this
[0:11] medium what form is he of and she said
[0:15] an old man cometh up and he is covered
[0:17] with the mantle and Saul perceived that
[0:20] it was Samuel and he stooped with his
[0:22] face to the ground and bowed himself and
[0:24] Samuel said to Saul why hast thou
[0:26] disqued me to bring me up and Saul
[0:28] answered I'm sword distressed. For the
[0:30] Philistines make war against me, and God
[0:32] has departed from me, and answerth me no
[0:34] more, neither by prophets, nor by
[0:36] dreams. Therefore, I've called thee,
[0:38] that thou mayest make known unto me what
[0:40] I shall do. Then said Samuel, Wherefore
[0:43] then dust thou ask me, seeing the Lord
[0:45] has departed from thee, and has become
[0:47] thine enemy? And the Lord hath done to
[0:49] him, as he spake by me. For the Lord
[0:52] hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand,
[0:54] and given it to thy neighbor, even to
[0:57] David, because thou obeyest not the
[0:59] voice of the Lord, nor executed his
[1:00] fierce wrath upon Amalecch. Therefore
[1:02] hath the Lord done this thing unto thee
[1:05] this day. Moreover, the Lord will also
[1:07] deliver Israel with thee into the hand
[1:09] of the Philistines. And tomorrow shalt
[1:10] thou and thy sons be with me, and the
[1:13] Lord also shall deliver the host of
[1:14] Israel into the hand of the
[1:16] Philistines." Then Saul fell straightway
[1:19] all along on the earth and was so afraid
[1:21] because of the words of Samuel and there
[1:23] was no strength in him for he had eaten
[1:25] no bread all the day nor all the night.
[1:28] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:32] I I'm going to give a title today of
[1:34] mixed media.
[1:37] And this is tying into what we
[1:39] ministered in on Wednesday. Mi mixed
[1:41] media. It's uh probably a familiar term
[1:43] to a number of you. I'm going to use it
[1:45] maybe in a little bit different context
[1:46] but draw from things that might be
[1:48] familiar to us in terms of the
[1:50] utilization of different things to
[1:52] create something. But Wednesday we spoke
[1:54] on modern mediums and the definition we
[1:57] gave to that was these forms of
[1:59] expression uh that shape our thoughts
[2:02] and influence our minds. There's an
[2:04] effect of these mixed mediums. Uh
[2:07] mediums uh could also be media. So this
[2:10] mo these modern mediums a medium is an
[2:13] agency or means of doing something. So
[2:15] they're channels. We have radio, TV, uh
[2:18] print, you know, the press, the
[2:19] internet, what we might call mass media.
[2:23] And even in art, a media is that
[2:26] physical or a medium as a physical
[2:28] material that would be used to create an
[2:30] artwork. It could even be a type of art
[2:32] itself. And those are some of the things
[2:34] that we were looking at just kind of
[2:35] using those things primarily just to
[2:38] understand these channels through which
[2:40] something can the utilization of
[2:42] something to convey. You use a a medium
[2:45] of paint to convey a visual image. You
[2:47] use the medium of print to convey a
[2:50] story. And the modern mediums was
[2:53] looking at kind of the modern tools that
[2:55] we use and the technology and how that
[2:57] it's been uh evolved to this point. how
[2:59] it combines these elements of community
[3:02] where you have human interaction and
[3:04] relationships and communication. And
[3:06] what these modern mediums have done is
[3:08] they've combined those interactions and
[3:11] communication on an unprecedented scale.
[3:14] uh there's always been a there's always
[3:16] been community and there's always been
[3:17] communication. But now uh through the
[3:21] advent of certain technologies and the
[3:23] combining of those things, it's just
[3:25] almost exponential and the way these
[3:27] things can be scaled to even now with uh
[3:31] the the increase in artificial
[3:34] intelligence, you can have an unlimited
[3:36] number of friends,
[3:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Uh because you can just have uh
[3:40] artificial fake friends. And you might
[3:42] think, well, that's all I've ever had,
[3:44] even before social media. Uh, but now
[3:46] you can have as many as you want. And
[3:48] you can, and so there's just such a
[3:50] different environment that we're living
[3:52] in. And it was part of uh my inspiration
[3:55] earlier this year when we kind of
[3:56] preached on that final uh front line
[3:58] that we are now fighting with things
[4:01] that uh Satan's using different tools
[4:04] and different things that we're going to
[4:05] have to wrestle with than we've never
[4:06] wrestled with before. Because these
[4:08] modern mediums are different from the
[4:10] traditional media because there's
[4:13] continuous unending creation and also
[4:16] just endless engagement where there's
[4:19] always something to click or to open or
[4:21] something to respond to. Uh you can't
[4:24] watch a a YouTube video anymore without
[4:28] mash that subscribe button, click turn
[4:30] on notifications, and be sure to follow.
[4:33] You can't do anything anymore without
[4:35] having there has to be a follow-up. And
[4:36] then there's another followup and you
[4:39] you buy a product and you're going to
[4:41] get asked for reviews for the next six
[4:43] years. Um you look at something online
[4:45] and and and even if you make the
[4:47] purchase, the cookies are going to
[4:48] remind you of that horrible purchase for
[4:51] decades. And so there's just always
[4:53] these ways that things are just
[4:54] continuously engaging and bringing
[4:56] things up. And we specifically zeroed in
[4:59] on social media. and social media are
[5:03] mediums of expression and relationship
[5:06] networks. So, it's a way to express
[5:08] ourselves or others are expressing
[5:10] themselves and if we're on any kind of
[5:12] social media platform and I think that
[5:14] can extend now to WhatsApp and even the
[5:16] way messaging works these days to where
[5:18] that can create community that has
[5:20] communication uh that there's a way that
[5:22] things are being expressed and even in
[5:25] our I would even say and I expect to get
[5:28] a really hearty amen. Family chat groups
[5:31] are the most toxic form of social media.
[5:36] And there's a way that things are said
[5:39] that are passive aggressive. And what
[5:41] does it do? It kind of spoils your
[5:42] spirit and calling. Why didn't they just
[5:44] call me and tell me that? Why did they
[5:46] say there? What's behind that? Why did
[5:47] they say this? And that's just the way
[5:49] social media works now on a large scale
[5:50] where there's things are being expressed
[5:53] and it's in the context of some sort of
[5:55] relationship network where now you feel
[5:57] that you're a part of something and uh
[6:00] this has gotten there's it's existed in
[6:03] the past but just gotten worse and worse
[6:05] and worse. So there's things that we're
[6:07] battling now I on a larger scale uh that
[6:10] are similar to things in the past but
[6:12] it's just worse than it's ever been. And
[6:15] it's that community and communication
[6:16] that becomes kind of that crux, that
[6:18] combination. Read from a book called The
[6:20] Anxious Generation on Wednesday night. I
[6:22] read this statement to you. It said,
[6:23] "This kind of connectivity offers few of
[6:25] the benefits of talking directly with
[6:27] friends." Uh that is applicable to
[6:30] family chat groups. It's applicable to a
[6:32] lot of different other chat groups and
[6:34] ways that we could communiate
[6:35] communicate. People will say things in
[6:38] text and email that they would never say
[6:41] to your face. And I didn't look at
[6:43] anyone in particular when I said that.
[6:46] But there's a way that people can
[6:47] interact in those channels where it's
[6:50] not really who they are. Uh, I saw um
[6:53] somebody sent me something the other day
[6:54] and it was a conversation where it was
[6:56] it was a wedding announcement and it was
[6:58] a wedding announcement of a couple and a
[7:00] lady was standing uh or it was a
[7:02] marriage and she's standing in her
[7:03] wedding dress and her husband uh was in
[7:06] a wheelchair and his name was like
[7:08] Jonathan Walker and somebody's response
[7:10] was do you feel like you were catfished
[7:13] by the name? I thought that was kind of
[7:14] funny. But uh there's ways that we're
[7:17] catfished now where people can present
[7:19] themselves in a particular persona and
[7:22] it's not who they are. You can fall in
[7:24] love with that or you can be drawn into
[7:26] that. There's ways that they work on
[7:28] your emotions. It says this kind of
[7:29] connectivity. People are just now
[7:31] getting the joke. A very few the few
[7:34] benefits of talking directly with
[7:35] friends. In fact, for many young people,
[7:38] it is poisonous.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; And it is poisonous. It's it is
[7:42] increased. It is the reason why we have
[7:44] increased anxiety. It's the reason why
[7:46] there's increased mental health issues.
[7:48] And I do think it's interesting as
[7:50] they've taken certain mental health
[7:52] disorders off the books, others have
[7:55] exponentially increased. And so we have
[7:58] we have increased uh depression, but we
[8:01] have decreased uh gender dysmorphia.
[8:05] And and where's the where's the increase
[8:07] happening? you said this wasn't a mental
[8:09] disorder, but now you're having
[8:11] increases in other areas because now
[8:12] they're just having to diagnose it as
[8:13] something else. And social media pushes
[8:16] a lot of these narratives and praises
[8:19] certain things. And now people can start
[8:20] to battle and wrestle with things and
[8:22] have to accept or consider things they
[8:24] otherwise wouldn't normally accept. And
[8:26] so we exist in a a vastly different
[8:29] social and technological landscape than
[8:32] any other time. And though parents no
[8:35] matter what age you are as you begin to
[8:36] have children, brother Renham said that
[8:38] our children have it 10 times harder
[8:40] than we did. And so that it's because of
[8:43] these advancements in technology and the
[8:45] pervasiveness of doubt and the way
[8:47] things are interconnected.
[8:49] And one thing and this I know the the
[8:52] tone or maybe the the pace of this is a
[8:55] little bit different this morning and um
[8:57] I don't know why my voice sounds like
[8:58] I've been screaming um but uh I haven't
[9:02] necessarily been screaming but it is
[9:04] impossible to immodderately or
[9:07] inappropriately use social media without
[9:09] being worse off spiritually.
[9:12] And I know I kind of qualified that in a
[9:14] way where maybe everyone would just say,
[9:15] "Yeah, but it's impossible to misuse
[9:19] social media and not be worse off
[9:21] spiritually."
[9:22] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely impossible to be do use
[9:25] social media to an excess or let me just
[9:27] say any modern medium to excess and not
[9:30] be worse off spiritually. I was thinking
[9:32] of the teaching that and and I believe
[9:34] this as brother Bam said, you come to
[9:36] church, he said you'll either leave
[9:37] worse off or better off. And I feel like
[9:40] we we could probably look at anything we
[9:42] do in life in a similar way that there's
[9:44] a way that if we can approach it or
[9:46] utilize something to where we are worse
[9:48] off or we can be better off. So it's
[9:50] impossible to use these things and not
[9:53] be worse off spiritually. So I want to
[9:56] continue on this thought process with
[9:58] this title mixed media. And mixed media
[10:02] is a combination
[10:04] of more than one medium. And so that
[10:07] would be what mixed media is. And so if
[10:09] you look at it in the terms of art,
[10:11] there's some sort of combination of
[10:12] different materials. Uh but then even uh
[10:15] uh sources or surfaces and one of the
[10:18] key characteristics and if you're in
[10:20] mixed media art, there's flexibility.
[10:22] You can use whatever you want. You say,
[10:23] well, that's not just a watercolor. It's
[10:25] also my tears or my blood or you know,
[10:27] whatever it is that goes into it. And so
[10:29] in art, when you're working using more
[10:31] than one medium, you have different
[10:32] materials. You can mix paint. You could
[10:34] have a watercolor and you could have
[10:36] acrylic. There's different things you
[10:38] can use. But I want you to think of it
[10:40] this way. This is something I learned
[10:41] lately that in using mixed media, it
[10:45] includes what you do it on. And they
[10:47] call that support. Brother Reggie, you
[10:49] being an artist, I know you probably
[10:50] knew this well before I did, but what
[10:52] you put your medium on and your
[10:55] materials on is called the support for
[10:57] it. So, it's actually a support for what
[10:59] you're presenting and what you're
[11:01] creating like oil on canvas or
[11:03] watercolor on paper and even different
[11:04] types of paper. And so, it's not just
[11:08] what's being made, but what's supporting
[11:11] it. And that kind of broadens our
[11:13] thought a little bit. And I hope that
[11:14] using something that's reachable for all
[11:16] of us, it helps us to see this because I
[11:19] am addressing what's in my heart as a
[11:21] pastor is addressing the challenges we
[11:23] face while utilizing these blended
[11:26] technologies, these things that combine
[11:28] all these different uh things, these
[11:30] blended media, the mixed media, multi-
[11:33] these multififorms of things as we
[11:35] interact with them and use them as
[11:36] Christians and as we try to overcome
[11:39] because these things can be inherently
[11:40] useful uh even critically necessary. I
[11:43] remember in Texas, I had a a barber who
[11:46] cut my limited hair and I thought maybe
[11:48] since I was losing so much hair that I'd
[11:50] get a discount and he said, "No, the fee
[11:53] stays the chain stays the same because
[11:55] the rest is for the hunting license."
[11:58] And
[12:00] and so he was telling me a story of how
[12:03] that his uh benefits as a veteran he
[12:06] could no longer access because he didn't
[12:08] have a cell phone. and you had to have a
[12:10] cell phone that could connect, you know,
[12:11] send text messages or do something
[12:13] online. And he didn't have any of that.
[12:15] He lo he was losing his veteran
[12:16] benefits. And so there's some things now
[12:18] that are critically necessary. We have
[12:21] to have it or otherwise you're not going
[12:23] to uh be able to do school or you're not
[12:25] going to be able to do your work. And so
[12:26] there's a lot of things that are a
[12:27] source of good and critically necessary.
[12:29] But the idea behind this thought of
[12:31] mixed media is it's mixed. It's not
[12:34] entirely good. It's mixed with evil. It
[12:38] can be misused. there's carnality to it.
[12:40] There's a lot of things that we use and
[12:42] say, man, this is a great tool. Then you
[12:44] find out, well, it was created for this
[12:45] purpose. And you're kind of like, I
[12:48] don't know that that changes the nature
[12:50] of that tool. That changes the nature of
[12:52] that website or or that platform. And
[12:56] what has been the thesis of the whole
[12:58] ser [snorts] this year using art is uh
[13:01] what is Christ today? What does he look
[13:04] like today? I was challenging myself in
[13:06] terms of the image of Christ and uh I I
[13:08] could dress up as the Hoffman's head of
[13:10] Christ and I would just look like a
[13:12] caricature of somebody 2,000 years ago.
[13:15] I could try to look like Martin Luther
[13:16] and once again I would just look like
[13:18] cosplay for medieval times. So there's a
[13:20] lot of ways to say how what does Christ
[13:22] look like today? And not so much at what
[13:25] would Jesus do, like what kind of car
[13:27] would he drive and where would he like
[13:28] to eat, but if Christ is in flesh today,
[13:31] he is going to look very differently
[13:34] than maybe what we have in our minds and
[13:35] it's going to be varied and it's going
[13:36] to have different activities and
[13:38] different expressions. But I want to
[13:39] know what that commonality is going to
[13:42] be in this expression of Christ. What
[13:44] does he look like and what does he uh uh
[13:47] what he what does he do in the believer?
[13:50] And then also what the devil is using to
[13:52] distort that reality or prevent that
[13:54] reality from manifesting. That's what's
[13:56] been at the heart. So there's a lot of
[13:58] things I think I'll mention today that
[13:59] has been mentioned already this year,
[14:01] but we're just revisiting this over and
[14:03] over again. Christ wants to reveal
[14:05] himself in you. What does that look
[14:08] like? How does that happen? But then how
[14:10] is the devil trying to stop that? How is
[14:12] it the devil is attacking this
[14:14] expression? Now, I've already I've
[14:16] already lost half a half half an hour,
[14:18] it feels like, in in the intro, so
[14:20] please stay with me uh as we continue on
[14:23] this. In 1st Samuel chapter 28, I think
[14:26] we can go quickly through this today and
[14:28] make an impactful point. We're the
[14:31] phrase we use is the witch of indoor and
[14:33] the scripture, she has familiar spirits.
[14:35] Obviously, she's one that can
[14:36] communicate between the living and the
[14:38] dead. I want to put ourselves in that
[14:40] place of you are the living. You are
[14:43] quickened to new life. And so we as
[14:45] Christians, we're the living, but then
[14:47] there's this other realm of sin and
[14:49] death and debauchery. And so how is it
[14:52] that we are going to have uh be
[14:55] confronted by death or darkness? There
[14:58] has to be a channel. There has to be a
[14:59] medium through which that can pass. And
[15:02] so the witch of indoor, we use the
[15:04] phrase witch. She was a medium or that
[15:06] channel of communication between the
[15:08] living and the dead. And this story is
[15:12] what kind of cemented this idea of the
[15:16] mixing because it's such an interesting
[15:18] mix of things. Says in verse six, "When
[15:21] Samuel inquired of the Lord, excuse me,
[15:23] when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord
[15:25] answered him not neither by dreams nor
[15:26] by urum nor by prophets. Then said Saul
[15:29] unto his servant, seek me a woman with
[15:31] that hath a familiar spirit that I may
[15:33] go to her and inquire of her."
[15:35] I I want to mention this again. The the
[15:38] mental health toll is worse for women
[15:42] than it is for men when it comes to
[15:44] social media. There's other modern
[15:46] mediums that have impacted young men and
[15:49] and things of uh video games and
[15:52] pornography has certainly destroyed the
[15:54] spirits and minds of men. But they find
[15:56] that the impact of social media as a
[15:59] medium has been grossly worse for girls
[16:03] than it has been for boys. And it's
[16:05] because there's more of a susceptibility
[16:07] in those channels. And so he says, "Go
[16:10] to a woman that hath a familiar spirit."
[16:11] And his servant said, "Behold, there's a
[16:13] woman that hath a familiar spirit at
[16:14] indor." This is a medium. This medium
[16:16] scripturally was despised by God. Israel
[16:19] was commanded to avoid and put away uh
[16:22] these practices. We looked at several of
[16:24] those scriptures on Wednesday night. So
[16:26] Saul was knowingly utilizing something
[16:29] that God had said, "Don't do it." He
[16:31] wants to hear from God. He's desperate,
[16:33] but he says, "Well, the I want to hear
[16:35] from God." So he's utilizing something
[16:36] that's forbidden, something that's
[16:38] unclean. And here comes the surprising
[16:41] part. He gets results.
[16:44] There's a surprising result. And
[16:46] actually, these results are very, very
[16:48] strange. If you read it as a as a
[16:50] Christian and you're reading your Bible,
[16:51] it's it to me it it's very very strange.
[16:53] And even you'll find that as theologians
[16:56] have wrestled with it, it's very
[16:57] controversial because people try to
[16:59] figure out really what just happened
[17:01] because God allows Samuel to appear as
[17:03] we read it in our text in verses 14 to
[17:05] 19. God allows Samuel to show up. And I
[17:09] I've read in different places and uh
[17:12] writers and pe people studying the
[17:14] scripture and theologians and even
[17:16] traditionally in the Hebrew uh
[17:18] tradition, they're trying to figure out
[17:19] why was this this medium all of a sudden
[17:23] shocked and surprised when she saw u
[17:26] Samuel. And it sounds as if she it plays
[17:30] out towards like, "Oh no, I just now
[17:31] realized if this is Samuel and somehow
[17:34] through this she realizes this is a
[17:36] prophet and and this is Saul and she
[17:38] recognizes she's been caught." But some
[17:41] surmise that maybe she had always been
[17:43] doing this as a trick and she always
[17:46] pretended and now it finally worked and
[17:47] it scared her to death. And so there
[17:50] could be something to that uh that she
[17:53] was practicing something and doing
[17:55] something that is fraudulent, that is
[17:57] deceitful, that hh is is hit or miss.
[18:01] And now God but yet God allowed Samuel
[18:05] to come up through at this moment that
[18:08] this medium is trying to contact the
[18:10] dead.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; I want to make this point though. This
[18:13] medium had no power over that prophet.
[18:15] Right?
[18:16] &gt;&gt; That medium had no actual power, actual
[18:18] control over drawing Samuel forth. But
[18:21] God permitted Samuel to come forth and
[18:25] he permitted it so that he could speak
[18:27] to Saul and rebuke him and reaffirm
[18:30] judgment reaffirm what he had already
[18:32] said. So when we look at this and we
[18:35] realize that Saul having this distance
[18:38] between him and God and a lack of
[18:39] humility or whatever it might have been
[18:41] and him not uh using uh um staying
[18:45] persistent in these channels or these
[18:46] channels being cut off and instead of
[18:48] him just accepting his fate and
[18:50] accepting judgment, he tries to use
[18:52] something God has condemned, he's being
[18:54] very hypocritical about it and God
[18:57] [snorts] allows Samuel to show up and
[19:00] speak to Saul.
[19:03] But God's use of this medium does not
[19:05] sanctify the medium
[19:08] &gt;&gt; that that should not have created this
[19:11] habit where now all of a sudden Saul's
[19:13] kind of like I'll see you tomorrow,
[19:16] &gt;&gt; right? This would shouldn't have been
[19:18] something where it justifies it. Well,
[19:20] now God spoke through this God Samuel
[19:22] this worked and brought forth Samuel and
[19:24] he spoke truth. Uh therefore I can
[19:27] excuse it. and our modern tools and even
[19:30] our modern recreations. They can be
[19:32] useful. They can be good. They can be
[19:34] very enjoyable. But we must be keenly
[19:38] aware of their capacity to poison.
[19:41] We must be aware and and I hope it's not
[19:44] too much of a leap to look at something
[19:45] that was expressly forbidden and that
[19:47] Saul should not have used at all and
[19:50] then now apply it to things that may not
[19:52] be expressly forbidden but uh critically
[19:55] necessary. But the same dynamic is at
[19:58] play where there's a lot of evil mixed
[20:00] into it. There's a lot of bad we can do.
[20:02] But when good comes from it, we kind of
[20:03] feel like, oh, then it's then it's all
[20:06] good. They still have a capacity to
[20:09] spoil.
[20:11] Still has a great capacity to disturb
[20:13] our spirits.
[20:15] And I think this extends to sports. I
[20:18] think there's a way that we can allow
[20:19] ourselves somewhat innocently to engage
[20:23] in in in sports a and have a team and
[20:26] cheer for it. But notice what it does to
[20:28] your mood. Notice how it can cling to
[20:31] you and stick to you. Notice how it
[20:32] maybe can keep you out of church or even
[20:34] alienate yourself in fellowship and
[20:36] different things. There's a way that it
[20:38] disturbs us and it shouldn't be that
[20:40] way.
[20:42] That's when we realize we say, "Well,
[20:43] there's nothing wrong with with men with
[20:46] really, really tight pants running
[20:47] around and hitting each other." You
[20:49] know, there's nothing wrong with that.
[20:50] There's nothing wrong with guys in tank
[20:52] tops and shorts sweating all over the
[20:54] place and running around and bumping off
[20:55] of one another. There's a way that you
[20:57] look at it and say, "There's nothing
[20:58] wrong with that." And and but that look
[21:01] at what it can do to your spirit
[21:04] &gt;&gt; and look at how it's not just one game a
[21:06] week. I don't know if the streak is
[21:08] over, but I'd read somewhere where
[21:10] beginning sometime last month, there was
[21:12] like 49 straight days of football every
[21:15] night of the week. And and you don't
[21:17] need to have um a gigantic satellite
[21:21] bowl out in your backyard to get all
[21:23] those games. They're accessible right on
[21:25] your cell phone.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; And so it's uh there's ways that they
[21:29] disturb us. And in worse, I would say
[21:32] that it inhibits our growth as
[21:33] Christians. If you're wanting to take an
[21:35] honest look at your life, say, 'I want
[21:36] to get closer to God. I want to be
[21:37] closer to the Lord. I want to be a
[21:38] better husband. I I want to be a better
[21:40] employee employee. I I want to do things
[21:43] better, you have to start looking at
[21:44] your life of well, what are the things
[21:45] keeping me from getting better?
[21:48] &gt;&gt; And it could be connected with number
[21:49] one, what you're feeding on. And then
[21:51] also, what's impeding growth that you
[21:54] should be getting from what you're
[21:55] feeding on?
[21:56] &gt;&gt; It's the concept of eating of going to
[21:59] McDonald's and getting a um what a size
[22:02] in your meal. So that you get everything
[22:04] is large and you get the large you get
[22:06] the large burger, you get extra cheese,
[22:09] you get the large fry and you get the
[22:10] diet coke.
[22:12] And people say, "Well, why would you
[22:14] even drink a diet coke when you're
[22:15] eating all that?" I said, "Hey, I wanted
[22:17] to balance out somewhere, right?" You
[22:19] like, you go you go for a walk and then
[22:20] you go you eat um 2,000 calories. And
[22:23] people say, "Well, you know, that's not
[22:24] going to help." He's like, "Why do you
[22:25] think I went on a walk? I want to create
[22:28] a deficit so that when I eat it just
[22:30] kind of all balances out." And you may
[22:32] be fe doing things right, going to
[22:34] church, and then you're doing other
[22:36] things that are drawing away from that.
[22:38] Like, man, I'm not getting the benefit
[22:39] from this.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not getting the gains that I thought
[22:42] I would get. And it's because you have a
[22:43] leak somewhere where something is
[22:45] drawing from that and taking away from
[22:48] your strength. So, you're not growing.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Uh, this thought came to me, and I know
[22:52] that many of you have already thought of
[22:53] this multiple times over the last few
[22:55] weeks, but this concept, it's a legal
[22:57] doctrine called the fruit of a poisonous
[22:59] tree. I know, brother Andrew, you're
[23:00] familiar with it. Not that you had to
[23:04] face this in any kind of legal context,
[23:05] but the fruit of a poisonous tree is a
[23:08] legal doctrine that excludes evidence
[23:10] that was obtained illegally. It's a real
[23:13] easy concept, but I want you to think,
[23:14] and it just really helped me to
[23:15] understand this. So, I I I reached for
[23:18] something in my heart as an attorney,
[23:20] something that I had learned or was
[23:21] familiar with, and it helped me to
[23:22] recognize, oh, wow, this is how certain
[23:25] things can hurt us and harm us. And the
[23:28] the idea between the fruit of a
[23:30] poisonous tree, if the evidence is
[23:31] obtained in the violation of someone's
[23:34] constitutional rights, they consider
[23:35] that evidence tainted.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; And then any subsequent information
[23:40] gained from that is the fruit of it. And
[23:44] that's considered tainted as well. So
[23:46] it's called the fruit of the po of a
[23:48] poisonous tree. So if somebody if if
[23:50] they executed something illegally and
[23:53] they found something and then they got
[23:55] information from that then all of the
[23:57] information all the fruit from that tree
[23:59] is considered poisoned and it can't be
[24:01] used against you.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; So why should they be able to violate
[24:04] our rights to obtain information and
[24:07] then use that information against us
[24:08] when they used it illegally? That's why
[24:10] our constitutional rights. These are our
[24:12] constitutional rights and that's why I
[24:15] love all these uh non I don't know what
[24:18] they're called anymore in the Texas in
[24:20] Texas they're like Texas republic people
[24:22] and they didn't believe in the
[24:23] constitution. So they refused to do all
[24:26] these things and refused to provide
[24:27] information and it just caused a lot of
[24:29] problems and then as soon as you put
[24:30] handcuffs on like this is a VIOLATION OF
[24:32] MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. It's like of
[24:35] that thing you don't even believe in.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Add this to the montage.
[24:44] And so there's uh this idea is that if
[24:47] it comes from that, it's poisoned as
[24:49] well.
[24:52] And there's a few exceptions to this
[24:54] rule. This is where we start getting
[24:55] into our criminal law class.
[24:58] There's actually an exception. This one
[25:00] makes me nervous that if it was obtained
[25:02] in good faith, like I didn't mean to
[25:04] violate his rights. It just happened.
[25:07] But there's an exception that the they
[25:08] can allow the evidence to be admitted
[25:10] under a good faith exception. But then
[25:12] also if it's obtained from an
[25:14] independent source outside of the
[25:16] illegal work or if it would have
[25:18] inevitably been discovered. So there's
[25:21] different ways where it says oh okay
[25:23] well the fruit is no long that
[25:25] information is no longer poisoned
[25:27] because there it can be there's an
[25:29] exception that basically qualifies it as
[25:32] good. And I know you're thinking, where
[25:34] in the world are you going with this?
[25:37] But Saul did not act in good faith
[25:39] &gt;&gt; when he went to that medium. He he was
[25:43] knowingly violating the word of God. So
[25:45] he could not justify his actions just
[25:48] because Saul Samuel spoke.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; All right there. This is where many
[25:55] times we have to catch ourselves and
[25:57] just how quickly we want to
[25:58] self-justify. Just because God allowed
[26:02] Samuel to speak, Saul could not say,
[26:04] "Oh, well, there was nothing wrong in
[26:05] doing what I did." Because after all,
[26:07] Samuel spoke.
[26:10] And we cannot justify our bad faith just
[26:13] because we get some good fruit.
[26:17] And we cannot justify certain things
[26:19] that we do. So, I wasn't I wasn't trying
[26:23] to do that. And I I didn't like
[26:25] expressly do this. It would be no
[26:28] different than than knowingly putting
[26:30] yourself in a position where you could
[26:32] take advantage of something without
[26:33] being very overt about it.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; And I hope that God can deal with your
[26:38] hearts in in much more particular ways,
[26:40] but I would even maybe say in the
[26:41] reverse of this, I don't know if this is
[26:42] the inversion, but bad fruit exposes bad
[26:45] faith.
[26:47] I
[26:47] &gt;&gt; if you approach something it with bad
[26:49] faith and and there's negative things
[26:51] coming out of it, that's exposing bad
[26:53] faith. And so we cannot justify the
[26:56] wrong kind of motive and objective and
[26:58] acting unfaithfully just because
[27:00] something good comes from it.
[27:03] And the way that I looked at this
[27:06] is things that are eternal,
[27:09] things that are purely for our spiritual
[27:11] good,
[27:13] they're ultimately going to be backed up
[27:15] by another source.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; You're going to be able to bring it back
[27:19] to the word. I was looking at the
[27:20] concept in the mouth of two or three
[27:22] witnesses, let everything be
[27:23] established. It's in the law quite a
[27:25] bit. Jesus uses it. Paul uses it. You
[27:27] can see that it's not just one source,
[27:29] but then it's verified by another
[27:32] source. It's the idea behind well that
[27:34] you can't use that evidence. But then an
[27:35] independent source provides the same
[27:38] information. And so anything that is
[27:40] really good, anything that's really
[27:41] beneficial, we can find it back in the
[27:44] word of God.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; We don't have to take it from a medium.
[27:48] We don't have to take it from this
[27:49] website. We don't have to take it from
[27:51] this source. uh or or well I I was
[27:54] watching this movie and I know it was a
[27:55] really really bad movie and it's a lot
[27:57] of like cuss words and a lot of nudity
[27:58] and a lot of inappropriate things but it
[28:00] really DEALT WITH MY HEART ABOUT GODLY
[28:01] SORROW and loss
[28:04] and and it's like well you KNOW THE WORD
[28:06] OF GOD COULD HAVE done that
[28:08] &gt;&gt; and this could have done that
[28:10] &gt;&gt; and so there's a way that if YOU HAD
[28:12] JUST SOUGHT GOD'S CHANNELS YOU WOULD
[28:14] HAVE inevitably discovered that
[28:17] &gt;&gt; so there's a lot of good and a lot of
[28:18] things that we can get from the the real
[28:21] source or independent sources or
[28:23] inevitably if we followed God's pattern.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; So it does give us pause or get causes
[28:30] me to ask what type of support are we
[28:33] using
[28:35] &gt;&gt; for what we do
[28:41] &gt;&gt; is what because I was going to use some
[28:43] of these scriptures but it's word upon
[28:45] word.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to take the word and put it
[28:48] on the wrong kind of support.
[28:50] I don't want to take the word and put
[28:51] the wrong thing on top of it.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; If there's going to be media, I don't
[28:56] want it to be mixed in the sense that
[28:57] it's word on top of something that's not
[28:59] word
[29:00] &gt;&gt; or the word with something that's not
[29:02] word on top of it. I I don't want to use
[29:04] the wrong support or have the right
[29:06] support for the wrong things. If it
[29:08] isn't the word on the word, then it's
[29:10] mixed media.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; If it's hard for you to understand this,
[29:14] this is the the amazing thing that's
[29:16] happening right now. The word is being
[29:18] made flesh and the flesh is becoming
[29:21] word. You are a representation of mixed
[29:24] media in the process of changing to a
[29:26] singular medium of the word only
[29:29] &gt;&gt; where this flesh is assumed into an
[29:32] eternal form and it's word word and
[29:34] nothing but word eternally
[29:37] &gt;&gt; and the idea of inevitable discovery.
[29:41] I was thinking of it in terms of this
[29:43] way. We can refuse God's provided way
[29:45] and God has said you should do this. You
[29:46] should do this. You should do this.
[29:48] Don't do this. Don't do this. But yet in
[29:51] failing to take God's provided way and
[29:53] we do the things he doesn't then somehow
[29:55] we get blessed by some other means or we
[29:57] hear something or receive something, we
[29:59] cannot use the blessing or benefit to
[30:02] justify the means because God never
[30:05] changes. Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; If God said, "I promise to feed you
[30:09] through this way or I can lead you
[30:11] through this way or this is a way to be
[30:12] blessed and you forsake that way and you
[30:14] do something else but you get a benefit
[30:16] FROM IT." THAT'S GOD'S grace in allowing
[30:18] Samuel to appear. But it does not mean
[30:21] do you keep visiting that fountain in
[30:23] perpetuity hoping to continue to get a
[30:26] blessing.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; We cannot use the blessing to justify
[30:29] the medium.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; I thought about this. I'm very grateful
[30:33] that even as a church and a small church
[30:35] with not a lot of means, we can uh and
[30:37] really it's a lowhanging fruit anymore
[30:39] to be able to stream services. Really,
[30:41] it's easy for anyone to start a church,
[30:44] right? But I'm grateful that we're able
[30:47] to uh allow it to be archived and and
[30:50] streamed. But if you're blessed through
[30:53] this medium
[30:55] &gt;&gt; of the streaming and the archives
[30:57] and the the idea of inevitable discovery
[31:01] is like the blessing you would get maybe
[31:04] exponentially by being here
[31:08] &gt;&gt; AND SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THIS WAY
[31:10] SAID I CAN'T USE THE FACT THAT GOD CAN
[31:12] USE THESE other means to bless me to
[31:14] forsake my duty of going to church
[31:17] giving to support and those different
[31:20] ways that God wants us to be be blessed
[31:22] or God wants us to be faithful.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; It would be staying at home and then
[31:26] this continued disobedience
[31:29] or this is would be the way that we say,
[31:31] "Oh, well, I'm getting something from
[31:33] this."
[31:34] &gt;&gt; But how many people and and and maybe
[31:37] this is when I should look into the
[31:38] camera, but I feel kind of bad because
[31:40] there's some people can't be here. Some
[31:42] people want to be or circumstances have
[31:43] gotten so difficult they can't make it
[31:44] to church. So, I'm not trying to call
[31:46] anybody out, but how many people have a
[31:48] a dedicated a dedicated medium that
[31:52] through which the only thing that comes
[31:53] through that is brother Aaron, brother
[31:56] Ellie Ezer, brother Reggie, right? How
[31:59] how many have a a sanctified medium
[32:02] where that's the only thing that comes
[32:03] to it?
[32:06] I imagine as soon as I'm done this
[32:08] morning, I was going to say the
[32:09] Cardinals game is going to be on, but
[32:11] it's tomorrow night.
[32:13] [clears throat] As soon as you're done,
[32:14] boom. switch to something else, right?
[32:16] It could be picture and picture. Could
[32:17] you imagine, Brother Lucas, right now
[32:19] I'm preaching and they've got the NFL
[32:21] red zone up.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; And someone says, THEY'RE LIKE, "WOW."
[32:27] LIKE, WHAT DID HE SAY? WHAT DID HE SAY?
[32:28] NO, the Buccaneers are about to cover
[32:31] the spread.
[32:34] I want you to think about it in a way
[32:36] that's really it's real
[32:39] &gt;&gt; that if if there's there's a there's a
[32:41] there's things that we can enjoy and we
[32:43] can get a benefit from. And just because
[32:44] you're getting a benefit from it, don't
[32:46] make the mistake of blessing it like,
[32:47] "Oh, this is good.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Th this is okay." No, it's still
[32:52] something God's using for your benefit.
[32:54] But ask yourself, what does God where
[32:56] does God want me to get this benefit
[32:59] more purely?
[33:00] &gt;&gt; How is it I can benefit from the
[33:02] preaching of the word of God more
[33:04] particularly without the drawbacks,
[33:06] &gt;&gt; without the danger line? We must be able
[33:09] to clearly identify
[33:12] the source of the benefit of the
[33:14] blessing
[33:15] &gt;&gt; because if you're getting it from a
[33:16] poisoned tree,
[33:19] there's still poison in that tree.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; So, we should not make the mistake of
[33:24] sanctioning or excusing some medium
[33:26] absolutely just because we can get some
[33:28] good from it.
[33:30] To help you understand this, I want to
[33:32] use our typical scriptures. And I think
[33:33] that one thing I I was praying about and
[33:36] really I was challenging myself on how I
[33:38] consistently go back to Genesis in the
[33:40] beginning and I was reminded how when
[33:43] God began to deal with my church uh my
[33:45] heart to start a church that he placed
[33:47] upon me this burden of in the beginning.
[33:51] And so I as I just kind of put it before
[33:54] the Lord, why am I why do I keep
[33:55] constantly going? Is it a crutch? Is it
[33:56] something I need to get out of? And it
[33:58] was like, no, this is part of the
[34:00] foundation in the beginning and always
[34:03] revisit this to understand this is how
[34:05] God laid it out. And we can make sense
[34:07] of where we are at the top sometimes by
[34:10] looking at where we are in the
[34:11] beginning. Says, "Out of the ground made
[34:13] the Lord God to grow every tree that is
[34:14] pleasant to the sight and good for
[34:17] food." So there was trees that brought
[34:20] only good. You could eat from it because
[34:23] it grew from the ground and it was for
[34:25] substance. You didn't have to worry
[34:27] about whether or not it was poisoned.
[34:29] You didn't have your brood with you,
[34:30] your wife and all your kids, and and you
[34:33] go up to a tree and you're not sure. Is
[34:35] this good food? Is this poisonous? And
[34:36] you take it and you give it to your
[34:38] least favorite son. You say, "Here, try
[34:40] this.
[34:44] Let's watch him for the next few days."
[34:47] Oh, you knew if it grew from the ground,
[34:49] IT WAS GOING TO BE it was wholesome.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; But then it says, "The tree of life also
[34:53] in the midst of a garden." So this
[34:54] didn't grow from the ground
[34:57] and it's it wasn't there for food
[35:00] necessarily like or literal food and the
[35:03] tree of knowledge of good and evil. What
[35:06] does this phrasing this description tell
[35:08] us? It was a tree of the knowledge of
[35:12] good and evil.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; It represent represented a mixture.
[35:19] It was not just good but now the
[35:21] knowledge of good and evil. And brother
[35:24] Bradom teaches at length I think in God
[35:26] of this evil age uh he deals a lot with
[35:29] the mixed tree and this mixture that
[35:32] there's a this knowledge mixed in with
[35:35] good makes even good evil when man's
[35:39] knowledge is attached to it. So God
[35:41] commands in verse 16, the Lord God
[35:43] commanded the man, saying, "Of every
[35:44] tree of the garden, thou mayest freely
[35:45] eat that grew out of the ground. That's
[35:48] good for food. But of the tree of
[35:49] knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
[35:50] not eat of it." Speaking in symbolic
[35:54] terms, for in the day that thou eatest
[35:56] thereof, thou shalt surely die. The
[35:58] fruit of this tree produces death.
[36:00] Another way of putting it is it's
[36:01] poisonous.
[36:03] It was a mixed tree because it added not
[36:05] carnal knowledge to good. It took
[36:07] something that God had ordained. It took
[36:08] something that was good, adding carnal
[36:11] knowledge to it, which can just take it
[36:12] out of its place. It could take it out
[36:14] of its time. There's ways that God was
[36:16] wanting them to bring forth children,
[36:18] BUT THEY DID IT OUTSIDE OF GOD'S TIME.
[36:20] And even that carnal knowledge attached
[36:23] to something that's God's will can make
[36:25] it evil.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO DO GOD A SERVICE WITHOUT IT
[36:29] BEING HIS WILL, TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH
[36:30] SOMETHING WITHOUT it being his way. And
[36:32] immediately something THAT WAS GOOD
[36:33] BECOMES EVIL AND PRODUCES death because
[36:36] we mixed it.
[36:38] We took our own motives, our own ideas,
[36:40] our own agendas, our own opinions, our
[36:42] own wants and wishes and how we can ask.
[36:44] The Bible teaches us we can ask a miss
[36:47] and heap upon ourselves troubles because
[36:49] we asked with the wrong motive and
[36:50] objective. So the tree of knowledge of
[36:53] good and evil is a mixed tree. This to
[36:55] me is a representative of a mixed media.
[36:59] Mixed media can be very very dangerous.
[37:01] Presents to us stumbling blocks and
[37:03] challenges to our faith. In Exodus
[37:06] 12:38, I'm I want to go through this
[37:09] making this point
[37:11] that as believers, we have a channel to
[37:14] God by faith through the word of through
[37:18] the word of God. So, we have if you're
[37:19] born again, you have the life of Christ
[37:21] inside of you. The only sense you have
[37:23] in your soul is faith. And it's the
[37:26] word, hearing of the word that increases
[37:28] that and grows that. And then it's
[37:30] expressing itself out. So we have this
[37:31] these very clear channels at least in
[37:34] terminology that faith in the word of
[37:37] God. So hearing the word that this this
[37:39] dynamo and this dynamic it's going to
[37:41] increase my faith and I'm going to grow
[37:42] as a Christian and now it doesn't make
[37:45] it so easy to know well then what is the
[37:47] word of God and what does it mean and
[37:48] and what am I praying for and how does
[37:50] that look that that's the continual uh
[37:52] uh growth and the challenge of
[37:54] Christianity. So then if that channel
[37:56] can be described in that way, then what
[38:00] are the things that get in the way? What
[38:03] are the things that inhibit that channel
[38:04] or muddy it up or cause us to shift our
[38:06] focus a little bit where we have faith
[38:08] and we think we're getting the word but
[38:09] we're getting something else mixed into
[38:11] it? And I'm going to use that as that's
[38:13] mixed media. That's the mixture and the
[38:15] mediums that try to muddy up the
[38:18] channels to where I'm not getting the
[38:19] full benefit of the word of God. In
[38:22] Exodus 12:38, some might read this and
[38:24] think this is a great testimony. And a
[38:26] mixed multitude went up also with them
[38:29] in flocks and herds and even very much
[38:31] cattle.
[38:32] So, oh my, what a revival that it's not
[38:35] just the Israelites that are going out,
[38:37] BUT THEY'RE BRINGING CONVERTS WITH THEM.
[38:39] Other people are coming out. ISN'T THIS
[38:41] WONDERFUL? BUT THE MIXED multitude
[38:43] speaks of a rabble, a collection. It's a
[38:46] diverse group of people that were
[38:47] non-Israelites following Israel. We
[38:49] might say this is a mighty move of God
[38:51] that even others are being saved. But
[38:53] notice in numbers 11:es 4-6. And the
[38:56] mixed multitude that was among them fell
[38:58] alusting.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel also wept
[39:02] again.
[39:04] Uh these two sentences and phrases are
[39:08] joined together because they're joined
[39:10] together.
[39:12] The children of Israel began to weep
[39:14] because there were people amongst them
[39:16] that began to lust after their past,
[39:19] began to lust after things of the world.
[39:22] And as they lusted after the things of
[39:24] the world and they begin to complain,
[39:25] they begin to murmur. Maybe it was,
[39:29] "Man, I really, really, really
[39:33] uh want to enjoy this and I really want
[39:35] to enjoy that and I I I want to enjoy
[39:38] this lifestyle." Brother Elazer put it
[39:40] this way. A lot of people don't like the
[39:41] word because it makes them feel guilty
[39:43] about what they love.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; It's that concept.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; So in instead of them saying,
[39:50] "I just really really really want to be
[39:52] uh promiscuous sexually and I want to do
[39:54] drugs and I I I I really want to enjoy
[39:56] all these things without guilt." They're
[39:58] like, "I mean, is this even true?"
[40:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, how do we even know? I mean, I
[40:03] was reading the Bible the other day and
[40:04] it says God loves all people. doesn't
[40:07] matter how your orientation that so they
[40:10] don't they don't come right out and say
[40:11] this is what I want to be and I want I'm
[40:12] going to do it they're going to start
[40:14] complaining so what did all these people
[40:15] that were lusting do says man this bread
[40:19] is tiresome
[40:21] man how could you continue to eat this
[40:23] bread don't you think that God would be
[40:26] great enough to at least put some you
[40:28] know some tomato sauce on it maybe some
[40:30] mozzarella right maybe some anchovies
[40:32] pineapple for those who are Italian and
[40:35] there's a way that You begin to look at
[40:37] it and say, "Oh man," and they're
[40:39] thinking, "Wow." They said, "We remember
[40:41] the fish which we did in Egypt freely."
[40:43] Now, who's remembering this? IT'S NOT
[40:45] THE MIXED MULTITUDE THAT FELL the
[40:47] lusting. IT'S THE MIXED MULTITUDE THAT
[40:49] STARTED PASSING ALONG AND BECAME A
[40:51] CHANNEL for the lust to now cause people
[40:54] who under the promise, who according to
[40:56] the Hebrew tradition could have eaten
[40:58] mana and it tasted like pizza with
[41:02] pineapple and Canadian bacon.
[41:05] THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT COULD HAVE TASTED
[41:06] LIKE. BUT THROUGH DOUBT, IT CAUSED HIM
[41:08] TO START SAYING, "OH MAN, we really want
[41:10] a different experience." We used to eat
[41:12] fish in Egypt and cucumbers and melons
[41:14] and leaks and onions and garlic or
[41:16] garlic. BUT OUR SOULS IS DRIED AWAY.
[41:20] THERE'S nothing at all beside this mana
[41:22] before our eyes. THERE'S NOTHING AT ALL
[41:25] BUT THE SUPERNATURAL WORD. GIVE ME
[41:27] SOMETHING ELSE, PLEASE.
[41:30] It's the mixed multitude that caused the
[41:32] hearts of the Israelites to turn back to
[41:34] Egypt. Why? They became the medium
[41:36] through which doubt could channel.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; They became the source, the mixed
[41:40] multitude mixed amongst them. The way
[41:43] the Bible READS IT IS HAD THEY NOT been
[41:46] there, Israel would have respond
[41:48] responded differently.
[41:50] They would have had reminders of that
[41:53] that your your 18-year-old is eating
[41:54] that man. I was like, it's just the same
[41:56] thing every day. It's the same thing
[41:58] every day. And the father could say,
[41:59] "No, son. It's mana." It's what is it?
[42:03] And it's not what is it in terms of what
[42:05] in the world is it? Is what is it you
[42:07] want it to be?
[42:09] &gt;&gt; What do you need it to be to you?
[42:11] &gt;&gt; What do you want to taste this morning?
[42:14] &gt;&gt; What is it? And that God was going to
[42:16] use something that seemingly seemed
[42:17] mundane and so simplistic maybe in its
[42:20] physical form. But you say, "This is
[42:22] bread that came supernaturally down from
[42:24] heaven. This is not a fairy tale. They
[42:26] went out and collected bread that
[42:28] gathered like dew
[42:29] &gt;&gt; in the night
[42:31] &gt;&gt; and they GOT TO A POINT TO WHERE THEY
[42:33] COULD COME TO CHURCH AND think uh these
[42:36] dew drops
[42:38] &gt;&gt; and not recognize THE SUPERNATURAL HAND
[42:40] OF GOD THAT WAS DOING IT. WHAT GOT TO
[42:42] THAT THEM TO THAT PLACE? A mixed
[42:44] multitude
[42:46] &gt;&gt; to whom the promise wasn't given.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; In Hosea 7:es 8 to9 just kind of
[42:52] continuing on the food theme. Ephraim,
[42:55] he hath mixed himself among the people.
[42:57] He joined with other nations. He was in
[42:59] league. And being in league with them,
[43:02] he had certain uh agreements. This this
[43:05] harmony of trade and even imitation.
[43:07] When the Bible says he had mixed himself
[43:09] with among the people, he actually
[43:11] allowed himself to become an imitator
[43:13] and uh traffic with them and commerce
[43:15] with them. There was community and
[43:17] communication.
[43:18] Ephraim is a cake not turned. Talk about
[43:22] a visual.
[43:24] He's a cake not turned.
[43:28] He's burnt on one side is literally what
[43:30] it means. Extreme lean SO FAR THERE'S NO
[43:34] BALANCE.
[43:37] And so therefore it's un it's unedible,
[43:40] inedible, inevitable.
[43:43] Strangers have devoured his strength and
[43:44] he knoweth it not through what? Mixing.
[43:49] Yay. Gray hairs are here and there upon
[43:52] him. Yet he knoweth not. His strength is
[43:56] gone. He's weakening and he doesn't
[43:57] know. Why? Mixed multitude.
[44:00] He's mixed himself. There's something
[44:03] pure has been lost. And so his strength
[44:06] is being sapped. Verse 11. Ephraim also
[44:08] is like a silly dove without heart. They
[44:12] call to Egypt. They go to Assyria.
[44:13] Notice where they're going. Look who
[44:17] they're trying to join with. Look what
[44:18] they're reaching for. It's not going to
[44:20] God who can be their help, but trying to
[44:22] get help from Egypt, trying to get help
[44:23] from Assyria, according the favor and
[44:25] acceptance of others. Let it hit home.
[44:27] You say, "I haven't called to Egypt. I
[44:28] haven't called to Assyria." No. But what
[44:30] is it we do when we mix ourselves and we
[44:32] join ourselves in commerce and communic
[44:34] community and communication with other
[44:36] people says become a silly dove? That is
[44:38] a dove, a foolish dove with no
[44:40] discretion.
[44:42] And it caused Ephraim by mixing to lose
[44:45] his strength and he doesn't know it. And
[44:47] he now he's a SILLY DOVE WITHOUT COURAGE
[44:49] AND WITHOUT HEART. HE'S FEARFUL. HE'S
[44:51] AFRAID. SO HE'S GOT TO JOIN LEAGUE HERE.
[44:53] He's got to make agreements here. He's
[44:54] got to have treaties here. AND HE'S GOT
[44:56] TO HE'S GOT TO BOLSTER HIS SUPPORT. I
[44:57] NEED THIS NEIGHBOR TO THIS SIDE TO HAVE
[44:59] MY SUPPORT. I NEED THIS NEIGHBOR TO THIS
[45:01] SIDE TO HAVE MY SUPPORT. I NEED TO MAKE
[45:02] THESE TREATIES INSTEAD OF TRUSTING IN
[45:04] GOD.
[45:06] I don't need to compromise and curry
[45:08] favor with my boss or my other fellow
[45:10] co-workers so that I keep my job or so
[45:12] that I get the bonus. I need to stay
[45:14] faithful in what God has called me to.
[45:16] Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; And I need to I need to TRUST IN GOD AND
[45:19] NOT MY NEIGHBORS and the strength of my
[45:21] relationships.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; They were silly doves, which is such a
[45:28] paradox. We're taught how the dove is
[45:31] gless. In fact, Matthew chapter 10 16,
[45:33] behold, I send you forth a sheep in the
[45:35] midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as
[45:37] serpents, it says, and harmless as
[45:39] doves.
[45:41] Harmless as doves. The word harmless is
[45:43] unmixed.
[45:46] unmixed as doves because a dove,
[45:50] think of what a silly dove is. A dove
[45:52] will not land and join itself to
[45:55] something that's dangerous.
[45:58] There's this sensitivity where they're
[46:00] keenly aware of of of how that um
[46:04] the uh of the dangers that would present
[46:08] themselves.
[46:10] And so a dove
[46:12] uh uh lights upon a lamb. A dove will
[46:15] find security and safety in things that
[46:18] are trustworthy and that are indeed
[46:20] safe. But a silly dove, you find itself
[46:23] playing around with a with a serpent. A
[46:26] silly dove will put himself in areas of
[46:28] harm, calling to Egypt, calling to
[46:30] Assyria. When he says harmless as doves,
[46:32] it means unmixed. That's the Greek word.
[46:35] 2 Corinthians chapter 6:14, be not
[46:37] unequally yolked together with
[46:38] unbelievers.
[46:40] For what communion for what fellowship
[46:43] hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
[46:45] And what communion hath light with
[46:46] darkness? To be unequally yolked is to
[46:49] be joined with one who's different in
[46:51] spirit
[46:54] and and different in nature. That's why
[46:56] the dove, the silly dove, will now begin
[47:00] to flirt with the nature different than
[47:02] theirs and will be taken advantage of.
[47:05] where a harmless dove, an unmixed dove
[47:07] is going to find kinship with something
[47:09] of a like nature. That's the dove and
[47:11] the lamb. That kinship, the nature
[47:13] between the two. But when one, he says,
[47:16] be harmless as doves, you're unmixed. He
[47:19] says, "Be unequally yolked with
[47:21] unbelievers, those of a different nature
[47:22] and different spirit." BECAUSE THAT'S
[47:24] HOW CONFLICT ARISES.
[47:27] And I am not a proponent of using
[47:29] scriptures like this to draw lines of
[47:32] separation, to use it for as an excuse
[47:35] to draw swords against other people.
[47:37] There's a there's a level of respect
[47:40] that we ought to have for every single
[47:42] person because they're human.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Life is a GIFT FROM GOD. REGARDLESS OF
[47:49] WHAT THEY'VE PUT ON TOP OF THAT CANVAS,
[47:51] IF THEY HAVE BREATH, THAT'S PRECIOUS.
[47:54] THEY HAVE LIFE, THAT'S FROM GOD. AND
[47:55] THERE'S A CERTAIN MEASURE OF RESPECT WE
[47:57] SHOULD GIVE, certain decency WE SHOULD
[47:59] HAVE TO EVERY SINGLE HUMAN.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; I don't care IF LIBERACE AND ELTON JOHN
[48:06] are are bullying you JUST BECAUSE OF
[48:08] THEIR LIFESTYLE GIVES YOU NO EXCUSE TO
[48:12] BE uncchristian towards them.
[48:20] So I'm not using these scriptures to
[48:22] create separation
[48:24] but to recognize the basis the reasoning
[48:27] is influence.
[48:30] What communion? What fellowship? So when
[48:33] we say be unequally yolked it doesn't
[48:34] mean oh I I can't I can't go to
[48:37] Thanksgiving dinner with my family
[48:38] because they don't believe the message
[48:40] like I do. Well they never will. And if
[48:44] that's your attitude maybe it's a good
[48:45] thing. Right?
[48:48] I mean, if that's what the message
[48:50] produces, I don't know that I want to
[48:52] have anything to do with it.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And I know there's uh there there's
[48:57] things that can happen in life where
[48:58] maybe you don't want to be with them and
[49:00] it has nothing to do with their
[49:01] interpretation of the message. It may be
[49:02] with the way that they have handled it
[49:04] and abused and treated you. I'm saying,
[49:06] but be sure you're not the one with the
[49:08] attitude of separation
[49:12] &gt;&gt; because it's going to be the way that we
[49:13] can influence others. they could see
[49:16] Christ
[49:18] that can make the difference. The sermon
[49:20] led by the spirit of God, I think even
[49:23] that just fits so well with the dove
[49:25] leading the lamb says, "So if in many
[49:27] full gospel doctrines seem hard to you,
[49:29] just get down and pray till the Holy
[49:31] Ghost gets into you. It'll lead you to
[49:33] the fountain as certain as I'm standing
[49:34] here." Notice it's not you just need to
[49:37] accept it. So pray until you get it. If
[49:41] you just get down to the fountain, empty
[49:43] so God can fill you up.
[49:47] It'll lead you to the fountain.
[49:48] Certainly as I'm standing here, if you
[49:49] just get down to the fountain, empty up
[49:50] so God can fill you up. Led by the
[49:52] spirit. Sons and daughters of God are
[49:54] led by the spirit of God. Abraham, the
[49:56] old patriarch, 75 years old, Sarah, 65.
[49:59] God met him one day down in the valley
[50:00] of Shinar there, the city of Er, and he
[50:02] said to Abraham, "I'm going to bless you
[50:03] and I'm going to give you a son by
[50:04] Sarah." said, 'Now, in order to do this,
[50:07] if you stay around all this unbelief
[50:09] around here, you'll get to doubting.
[50:12] So, what's the connection?
[50:14] You lie with dogs, you get fe fleas. Is
[50:16] that what it is?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a connection between,
[50:21] he says, if you're going to hang around
[50:23] unbelief, you're going to start to
[50:25] doubt.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Why am I doubting all of a sudden? Why
[50:29] am I fearful? Why am I worried? Why am I
[50:31] anxious? I've got no reason to be
[50:33] anxious. Life is good. Why am I so
[50:35] troubled IN MY SPIRIT? WHY DO I FEEL
[50:37] LIKE SOMETHING'S WRONG? WHY AM I
[50:39] ANXIOUS?
[50:42] &gt;&gt; YEAH, especially if you look at your
[50:44] life and everything's going well, start
[50:45] looking at the doubt, the unbelief
[50:47] that's near you.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; He says, "You're just going to go
[50:50] doubting, but I want you to separate
[50:51] yourself." USUALLY, IF A MAN'S going to
[50:53] be a believer, he has to separate
[50:55] himself from his worldly friends. He
[50:58] says, "All the people." So, if a man's
[51:00] going to be a believer, there must be
[51:02] some change. I'm not trying to interpret
[51:04] what brother Brandham said, but to
[51:05] separate yourself from your worldly
[51:07] friends means there's some change in the
[51:09] dynamic.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean there's no longer an
[51:12] association. It doesn't mean there's any
[51:14] no longer a friendship, BUT NOW
[51:16] SOMETHING HAS TO BE SEPARATED OUT.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; So that there's this understand that
[51:21] this in this relationship I HAVE WITH
[51:23] THIS PERSON, I KNOW WHO I AM AND I know
[51:25] who they are. Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; And I have TO BE CAREFUL TO NOT ALLOW
[51:29] THINGS TO BECOME MIXED TO WHERE I'M NOT
[51:32] GETTING THE BENEFIT FROM THIS FRIENDSHIP
[51:33] THAT I CAN GET AS GOD WOULD ALLOW AND
[51:35] THAT I'M NOT BEING inappropriately
[51:37] offended or bothered or discouraged.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of times you HAVE TO
[51:43] RECOGNIZE, YEP, THOSE are your parents.
[51:47] They're your parents, sure enough. BUT
[51:49] EVERY TIME YOU TALK TO THEM, you get a
[51:51] bad attitude towards your spouse.
[51:55] And you have to start recognizing
[51:56] they're your parents. They'll always be
[51:58] your parents, right?
[52:01] Should I tell a story? Maybe not. I just
[52:04] remember when Sister Elizabeth and I
[52:06] were
[52:08] dating, courting,
[52:11] and uh she had a particular friend she
[52:12] talked to.
[52:14] And I I could always tell she had talked
[52:16] to that friend
[52:18] &gt;&gt; because Elizabeth who's positive and
[52:20] happy and sweet. Once she talked to this
[52:22] one friend, you could just tell there's
[52:25] a little bit of an edge there. And
[52:26] actually, I could tell when she spent
[52:27] time with certain family members of
[52:28] mine. I'd be like, "Who are you with
[52:32] today?
[52:33] Let me guess." Right? Because there's
[52:36] just a way they work on you.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And you're not natured like you're
[52:39] normally natured. You're different.
[52:42] This is what the scriptures are talking
[52:44] about. Brother says, "A man, if he's
[52:45] going to be a believer, he's got to
[52:46] separate himself from worldly people."
[52:47] Why? They're not believers.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; So, they're oozing unbelief that causes
[52:53] doubt. He says, "Yoke yourself out up
[52:55] from amongst unbelievers." THEY WILL
[52:58] ONLY CALL YOU BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; And as I read that, THEY'LL ONLY CALL
[53:04] YOU BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN. WE COULD
[53:06] SAY IT IN SENSE OF WELL, THUS SAYITH THE
[53:07] LORD, YOU'LL MAKE IT BACK INTO THE world
[53:09] again. But maybe we COULD LOOK AT SAY
[53:11] THEY ARE ONLY CALL THEY'RE CALLING YOU
[53:13] BACK TO THE WORLD AGAIN.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; There's an influence there. There's a
[53:17] pressure there. And then he says
[53:19] environment has a lot to do with it.
[53:22] And as I was reading in this sermon and
[53:24] I saw where brother is talking it takes
[53:26] a birth. It takes a birth and he's
[53:28] talking about atmosphere uh in order to
[53:30] hatch a life and hatch a birth. I
[53:32] realize he he's not changing the chain
[53:35] of thought from the uh that you need an
[53:38] environment or an atmosphere to be born
[53:39] again, but it also applies to the
[53:42] atmosphere and the environment of being
[53:44] with those who aren't born again. That
[53:46] the environment that they're allowed to
[53:48] create impacts us. The environment that
[53:51] mixed media is allowed to create, the
[53:53] environment that social media IS ALLOWED
[53:55] TO CREATE, THE ENVIRONMENT THAT MODERN
[53:56] MEDIUMS ARE ALLOWED TO CREATE impacts
[53:59] us.
[54:02] And I know I'm putting a bullseye on
[54:03] social media.
[54:05] Uh and uh I I had spelled it social
[54:08] media in one place. So whoever media is
[54:12] is getting it.
[54:17] But social media is mixed media. It's a
[54:20] mixture of mediums,
[54:23] mixture of communities and
[54:24] communication.
[54:26] Communities that have no vetting other
[54:27] than you check the box.
[54:30] communities that have no vetting other
[54:32] than that you created a username and a
[54:34] password.
[54:36] There's there as there's a
[54:40] a mixing that takes place on these
[54:42] platforms through these technologies. I
[54:44] think that one thing that parents should
[54:46] be very keenly aware of. Uh let me say
[54:50] this, this is a PSA.
[54:52] This is for free. The federal cuts and
[54:56] the current uh stoppage of the
[54:58] government has not stopped me from being
[55:00] able to make a public announcement. This
[55:02] has been provided by anonymous donors.
[55:04] Even Adventures in Odyssey has social
[55:08] media components in the app.
[55:12] And while you're busy focusing on focus
[55:14] on the family, somebody's focusing on
[55:16] your family,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; right? AND YOU SHOULD CHECK TO MAKE sure
[55:20] that your children aren't making having
[55:24] conversations and communication on these
[55:27] platforms, whether it be a gaming
[55:28] platform or apps, uh, teams and all sort
[55:31] zooms and all sorts of online things
[55:33] that have come in our orbit. And you
[55:35] say, well, uh, should we BE WORRIED
[55:37] ABOUT THIS? YEAH, [screaming] I DON'T
[55:39] KNOW ABOUT BEING WORRIED, BUT YOU SHOULD
[55:40] AT LEAST BE CONCERNED. YOU should be
[55:42] very deliberate and very sensitive.
[55:44] DON'T FEAR, BUT you should address these
[55:46] things. You should know who your
[55:48] children are talking to. And I'm talking
[55:50] about our children. I have conversations
[55:52] quite often with my oldest son. He will
[55:54] go unnamed as he's known as Elliot. That
[55:57] as he's getting older, he's getting TO
[55:58] THE PLACE WHERE I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE
[56:00] ALL THE FILTERS in place. What's the
[56:02] point? He's going to be 18 years old
[56:05] next year. You want to plug your
[56:07] birthday? And there's A POINT AT WHICH
[56:09] IT'S LIKE HE'S GOT I I'VE TAUGHT HIM ALL
[56:11] I CAN AND I'M NOT GOING TO STOP TEACHING
[56:12] HIM, BUT HE'S going to have to start
[56:14] making real world decisions and real
[56:15] world mistakes.
[56:18] And so I KNOW THERE'S A POINT AT which
[56:20] they say we have a we have the
[56:21] responsibility to keep it away from
[56:23] them.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; But that we have this responsibility
[56:27] maybe to not go a day longer than we
[56:29] ought to because that begins to work in
[56:31] the inverse. And my goodness when to do
[56:34] that that's the battle. How far to
[56:37] tread? How lightly to tread.
[56:40] But I want to say this these all these
[56:42] little different uh components that
[56:44] build community and communication.
[56:47] It has been I believe if I just say in
[56:49] my opinion one of the most critical
[56:51] pieces in the corruption of faith
[56:54] and faithful faithlessness
[56:56] unfaithfulness in modern times
[57:01] from planting seeds of doubt to the
[57:03] fixation on certain appearances or
[57:05] activities.
[57:07] the internet, social media, the fusing
[57:09] together of certain mediums and I would
[57:11] say the ability to place
[57:14] the world into a palmable format
[57:19] has allowed us to digest things on a
[57:21] level and with such great frequency that
[57:24] it's been a tool used by the devil to
[57:26] plant seeds of doubt and to cause
[57:29] unfaithfulness.
[57:32] There are, and I want to say this maybe
[57:34] just in
[57:37] a
[57:39] a veiled way just to cause everyone to
[57:41] start looking around, but you know,
[57:43] there are telltale signs when an
[57:45] individual or a family is being
[57:47] influenced by social media.
[57:50] There are telltale signs.
[57:56] There are
[57:58] the bite-size format of shorts and reels
[58:03] and uh vines, whatever it is they are
[58:06] called today. I'm like tick tock. That's
[58:09] what it was. Yeah. Somebody somebody was
[58:11] going tick tock. Tick tock.
[58:14] They influence us [snorts]
[58:18] because there's a certain rhythm.
[58:19] There's a certain nature of a repetitive
[58:22] the algorithm is reinforcing things and
[58:25] we think what a coincidence. I WATCHED A
[58:29] VIDEO ON THAT JUST TWO SECONDS AGO and
[58:32] liked it AND NOW THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
[58:36] Somebody's trying to say something to
[58:37] me,
[58:39] right? It must be the Lord
[58:43] BECAUSE NOW WAIT, IT HAPPENED THREE
[58:45] TIMES IN THREE MINUTES.
[58:48] SEVEN DAYS IN A ROW. DO THE SPIRITUAL
[58:50] MATH.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ELOHIM. IT'S ALGORITHM.
[58:57] THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE INFLUENCED BY IT. WE'RE SHAPED
[59:00] BY IT. AND NOW WE got to do this and we
[59:02] got to do that. We want to present this
[59:04] and we want to present that. AND BEFORE
[59:05] YOU KNOW IT, YOU FIND YOURSELF BACKSLID.
[59:08] And you take the breadcrumbs back to the
[59:10] time when you got so fixated on certain
[59:12] influencers, certain ways of living and
[59:15] certain ways of doing, certain ways of
[59:17] talking and certain ways of presenting
[59:18] yourself. You wanted to have an image.
[59:20] You wanted to have a persona. And it so
[59:22] gets ingrained in your mind, you've been
[59:24] poisoned.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 16 17 to 20. Now I
[59:30] beseech you, brethren, mark them which
[59:31] cause divisions and offensives contrary
[59:33] to the doctrine which you have learned,
[59:35] and avoid them. This scripture still
[59:38] applies today.
[59:41] For they that are such serve not our
[59:44] Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly.
[59:47] That's what that's that describes in
[59:50] carnal terms what social media
[59:52] influences are.
[59:56] They serve themselves.
[59:59] They are not turning you on to a great
[1:00:01] new product. They're wanting to make
[1:00:02] money off of you.
[1:00:04] The reason why you're not paying for
[1:00:06] that video is because you're the
[1:00:07] commodity.
[1:00:10] They serve their belly and by good words
[1:00:12] and fair speeches deceive the hearts of
[1:00:13] the simple. That describes social media.
[1:00:17] For your obedience has come abroad unto
[1:00:18] all men, and I am glad therefore on your
[1:00:20] behalf. But yet I would have you wise
[1:00:22] unto that which is good,
[1:00:25] knowledgeable of that which is good.
[1:00:27] Notice how this in some way untangles
[1:00:29] the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[1:00:31] You're wise, knowledgeable, and
[1:00:33] understanding of the good and simple,
[1:00:35] which the same word is harmless or
[1:00:38] unmixed concerning evil.
[1:00:41] There's that mixture again that becomes
[1:00:43] the problem. It's the mixing, the
[1:00:45] integrating, the joining together. Our
[1:00:48] life, we're not going to be able to get
[1:00:49] away FROM EVIL. IT SURROUNDS US. It's
[1:00:52] everywhere. It's even in our human DNA
[1:00:55] and our memories and in our affections
[1:00:56] in our so the the disentangling of those
[1:00:59] things is not in the sense THAT WE CAN'T
[1:01:01] WE WE CAN'T HAVE IT AROUND US IN ANY
[1:01:03] CAPACITY AT ALL BUT THERE'S A LEVEL of
[1:01:05] fusing and combining and mixing THAT
[1:01:08] BECOMES HARMFUL. SO HE SAYS I WANT YOU
[1:01:09] TO BE WISE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE OF GOOD AND
[1:01:11] unmixed concerning evil.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the sermon making
[1:01:17] the valley full of ditches these kings
[1:01:18] made an alliance among them and they
[1:01:20] went over to fight Assyrians. And so
[1:01:22] there's this league, this joining
[1:01:24] together. And when on their road up,
[1:01:26] they went hastily, not consulting the
[1:01:28] Lord. For time's sake, we just didn't
[1:01:30] even build these scriptures together for
[1:01:31] this. He says, "That's the way you do
[1:01:33] when you get mixed up with unbelievers."
[1:01:36] So notice how they joined league. And
[1:01:38] this is we're going to fight a an enemy
[1:01:40] to Israel. And you start making
[1:01:41] alliances because you've got a common
[1:01:43] enemy. You realize this? If you could
[1:01:46] find if if you could find something you
[1:01:49] all hate like uh Joe Biden,
[1:01:54] then you'll have fellowship with people
[1:01:58] that hate Joe Biden,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; right? Fly the flags and everything
[1:02:04] else, right? Hey, we're in this together
[1:02:06] because we hate this.
[1:02:08] We we hate Camala, Camala, Camalive,
[1:02:12] Wahala, right? We hate her. So we're all
[1:02:15] going to be against her. And so you'll
[1:02:18] lock arms in March, right? Against the
[1:02:20] capital
[1:02:22] with unbelievers,
[1:02:25] right? People that as long as they hate
[1:02:27] this person, like I don't care what your
[1:02:29] hang-up is, what your problem is. I
[1:02:31] don't you know what what are your
[1:02:32] pronouns? All of them. BUT WE HATE THIS
[1:02:34] GUY,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT AS SOON AS WHAT you hate
[1:02:38] falls,
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; you got to find somebody else to hate.
[1:02:42] And now everybody want hates the
[1:02:43] multi-pronoun GUY, RIGHT? WE GOT A NEW
[1:02:45] ENEMY NOW. BIDEN'S DEAD. WE [screaming]
[1:02:47] HATE YOU. IT'S LIKE, WAIT, I THOUGHT WE
[1:02:49] WERE FRIENDS. NO.
[1:02:52] And so here's this working together. But
[1:02:55] this is what happens when you get mixed
[1:02:56] up with unbelievers.
[1:02:58] They have different agendas, different
[1:03:00] motives. When you claim your healing
[1:03:02] here and go outside and somebody say,
[1:03:04] "Ah, it's nonsense. There's nothing to
[1:03:06] it. Don't believe that." That's
[1:03:07] psychology. You're just mentally worked
[1:03:09] up. Okay. Fill in the blank.
[1:03:13] Fill in the blank. I feel God's calling
[1:03:17] me to do this. God, I see in the word of
[1:03:20] God asked me to do this. It's become
[1:03:22] plain to me in the scripture. This is
[1:03:23] the standard that God has for a home or
[1:03:25] for a woman. And what will they say?
[1:03:27] That's nonsense.
[1:03:30] He says, "Look out. Right there is the
[1:03:34] biggest danger line you ever hit."
[1:03:37] He says, "You separate yourself from
[1:03:39] that person right then. have nothing
[1:03:40] else to do with them at all. Nothing.
[1:03:42] How do you do? If they want to be led of
[1:03:44] the Lord, you do so. But keep yourself
[1:03:46] away from unbelief.
[1:03:48] There's an immediate pause in terms of
[1:03:50] those dynamics where if God is c God is
[1:03:54] dealing with your heart, if there's a
[1:03:55] channel or medium through which God is
[1:03:56] working in your life and you can sit in
[1:03:58] the word of God and you're rejoicing in
[1:04:00] that, we have to be realize there's
[1:04:02] influences now. And this is kind of
[1:04:04] somebody on the street talking face to
[1:04:06] face. But when we have voices,
[1:04:10] you have voices. Listen, there is um
[1:04:13] what is it? I I came across them one
[1:04:15] time. Uh it's good mythical morning or
[1:04:18] something like that. Is it Rhett and
[1:04:20] Link? Am I sewing seeds now? They seem
[1:04:23] LIKE GOOD KIDS OR WHATEVER AND they were
[1:04:26] Christian. Well, they've had a
[1:04:27] transformation and they've woke up and
[1:04:30] they realized that the way that they
[1:04:31] were raised was wrong and God is not
[1:04:33] true and the Bible is this and THE
[1:04:34] BIBLE'S THAT. AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE
[1:04:36] THEY MOVED OUT OF NOWHERE NORTH CAROLINA
[1:04:39] TO HOLLYWOOD to continue making money as
[1:04:43] podcasters or whatever it is they did
[1:04:44] content creators. AND THERE WAS A
[1:04:46] CERTAIN POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE WE'RE
[1:04:47] GOING TO MAX OUT AT multi-millionaires
[1:04:49] with this theology. WE GOT TO TEAR DOWN
[1:04:52] THIS WALL if we're going to make more
[1:04:53] money.
[1:04:55] And so then now they become this
[1:04:57] sympathetic, oh we were raised
[1:04:59] legalistically and we didn't know this
[1:05:01] and we were brainwashed and now they
[1:05:03] turn against Christianity. They turn
[1:05:05] against Christ. They turn against God
[1:05:07] and they try to come across as these
[1:05:09] sensitive and caring and and thoughtful
[1:05:12] and loving. And if you're not careful,
[1:05:14] you might enjoy the videos where they
[1:05:16] eat all sorts of weird foods, but it
[1:05:18] opens the door to the ear biscuits
[1:05:21] podcast and things like that and you
[1:05:23] start hear them talking about things
[1:05:25] that are anti-faith
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; and you just wanted TO KNOW WHICH COTTON
[1:05:30] CANDY FLAVOR WAS THE best
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; and you're walking around wondering why
[1:05:34] YOU EVER BELIEVED THE BIBLE.
[1:05:42] You start going to the dentist and you
[1:05:43] stop going to church.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "Keep yourself away from
[1:05:48] unbelief.
[1:06:00] I'll stop there
[1:06:05] and continue here.
[1:06:11] He says, "To be wise
[1:06:15] unto that which is good." I think I
[1:06:16] could just go quickly here.
[1:06:20] I left some things out, but I realize
[1:06:21] we're in the after hour, and I don't
[1:06:23] want to be labor this. Some of you are
[1:06:25] still getting dust out of your eyes.
[1:06:30] He said, "Wise unto that which is good."
[1:06:33] I I have to finish this part. There's
[1:06:36] enough social media and everything out
[1:06:37] there. I want you to realize there's a
[1:06:38] pure medium.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; The tree of life also in the midst of
[1:06:44] the garden. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; In Satan's Eden today, it was in God's
[1:06:49] eating, but now in Satan's Eden today,
[1:06:51] we're living in the harvest of the tree
[1:06:54] of knowledge of good and evil. It's all
[1:06:56] poisonous fruit.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; But what has come down to visit us in
[1:07:00] the midst of Satan's Eden? The tree of
[1:07:02] life. Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; The tree of life is now available.
[1:07:06] Genesis 3:es 22 to 24. I want you to
[1:07:08] recognize the power embodied in the tree
[1:07:10] of life. And the Lord God said, "Behold,
[1:07:11] the man has become as one of us to know
[1:07:13] good and evil. He's now a mixed tree
[1:07:15] himself." You said, "WELL, BUT HE'S LIKE
[1:07:18] GOD." NO, but not like God.
[1:07:21] And now, lest he put forth his hand and
[1:07:23] take also of the tree of life and eat
[1:07:25] and live forever. Whoa. Wait, what?
[1:07:30] man as a mixed man having mixed himself
[1:07:33] with doubt. Man now having been stripped
[1:07:36] of his holy image, there was still AS A
[1:07:39] FALLEN MAN WHO'S now sinful under the
[1:07:41] sentence of death. The the inoculation
[1:07:43] or the anecdote was to take of the tree
[1:07:45] of life and he wouldn't die.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Lord sent him forth from
[1:07:50] the garden of Eden to till the ground
[1:07:51] from which he was taken. SO HE DROVE OUT
[1:07:53] THE MAN AND he placed at the east of the
[1:07:54] garden of Eden cherubams and a flaming
[1:07:56] sword which turned every way to keep the
[1:07:58] way of the tree of life. lest man would
[1:08:00] partake of it and live forever in that
[1:08:02] mixed fallen state.
[1:08:05] But eternal life was in the tree.
[1:08:08] There's no death in that tree.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:08:12] is a mixed tree. This is a tree of good.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; This is a tree of life. This is a tree
[1:08:18] of power without a downside.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; My son Preston's been writing a paper on
[1:08:24] what strength is and his gift and
[1:08:26] looking at things from a different
[1:08:28] angle. He's talking about strengths and
[1:08:30] advantages and how they're used. And
[1:08:32] there's ways that you could define
[1:08:33] strength in very very unique ways and
[1:08:37] and so you realize with some strengths
[1:08:39] come weaknesses.
[1:08:42] And that's and a lot of times that's
[1:08:43] really what when it comes to athletic
[1:08:45] competitions and some things you say,
[1:08:46] well, you're going up against this great
[1:08:48] powerhouse. You know all their
[1:08:49] strengths, but what's their weakness? A
[1:08:52] lot of times, if someone's really really
[1:08:53] strong in in something and they're real
[1:08:56] robust in something, it has a it has a a
[1:08:58] it's a double-edged sword.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; But this tree of life, no weakness to
[1:09:02] it.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; And so, in the beginning, where there
[1:09:07] was this warning against the mixture,
[1:09:10] there was something unmixed
[1:09:13] that could not be overpowered by the
[1:09:15] mixture. Revelations 22:es 1 and two, we
[1:09:18] come to the very end now. And he showed
[1:09:20] me a pure river of water of life, clear
[1:09:22] as crystal, proceeding out of the throne
[1:09:23] of God and of the lamb. I'm wanting to
[1:09:25] tell you right now, in the midst of all
[1:09:27] the mixed media and the modern mediums,
[1:09:29] there's a pure river.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And it says, "And in the midst of the
[1:09:34] street of it, and on either side of the
[1:09:35] river was there the tree of life, which
[1:09:38] bear 12 manners of fruits and yielded
[1:09:40] her fruit every month, and the leaves of
[1:09:41] the tree were for the healing of the
[1:09:43] nations."
[1:09:45] The life of that tree, the leaves of
[1:09:47] that tree, there was no poison in that
[1:09:50] tree.
[1:09:52] It was a tree of life. Therefore, the
[1:09:54] fruit that came from it could not be
[1:09:55] poisonous to where the leaves were for
[1:09:57] healing. That tree could heal and
[1:10:00] sustain life even for the nations that
[1:10:02] were not in glorified bodies.
[1:10:07] And let me say this,
[1:10:10] we live naturally by the tree of
[1:10:11] knowledge of good and evil. We can't
[1:10:13] avoid it. We're all wearing clothes from
[1:10:15] it. We eat food from it. So therefore,
[1:10:18] we must eat from the tree of life to
[1:10:20] live
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; because we're eating from the tree of
[1:10:24] the knowledge of good and evil to live
[1:10:26] naturally. We must eat of the tree of
[1:10:28] life to live spiritually.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; We're living in an age when the pale
[1:10:32] horse is riding beginning its ride. Not
[1:10:35] quite quite yet in its final ride and
[1:10:37] death, but he's uh begin to ride out
[1:10:39] against the bride. That pale horse, what
[1:10:41] is what this the horse he sits on, his
[1:10:43] support? Death. What is it that follows
[1:10:46] him? Hell. What is pale? It's a mixed
[1:10:49] color.
[1:10:50] It represents death and mixed creeds.
[1:10:53] That's what you're fighting against is
[1:10:55] the mixture.
[1:10:57] And this mixed media, these modern
[1:10:59] mediums contain poison.
[1:11:02] And I'm telling you right now, every
[1:11:03] single individual in here, I'm telling
[1:11:05] you, the only anecdote, the only thing
[1:11:08] that'll protect you against it is the
[1:11:10] tree of life.
[1:11:13] And that's I I say that in our families
[1:11:15] to individuals to all of us that with
[1:11:18] all the poison we're ingesting and with
[1:11:21] all the contaminants we're bumping up
[1:11:23] against eating the tree of life will
[1:11:26] allow you
[1:11:28] to not be impacted by the evil and get
[1:11:32] the good out of it. Brother Ernie
[1:11:35] Villoeva used to have this saying and
[1:11:37] God bless him. He's such a wonderful
[1:11:38] brother. He passed away a number of
[1:11:40] years ago. He used to have this saying
[1:11:41] when he would go do a a seminar or do a
[1:11:44] conference. It might have been brother
[1:11:45] Ernie may have been one that introduced
[1:11:46] the message to brother Martin Jones, but
[1:11:48] he would go do these seminars for Hoover
[1:11:50] vacuum cells. And is that it? Was it
[1:11:52] Hoover? Okay. I was like all of a sudden
[1:11:54] that sounded kind of cheap. I don't know
[1:11:56] why. Hoover. Um but there's he would do
[1:11:59] these seminars and he would when he
[1:12:00] would go he say I'm going to get a
[1:12:02] little gold out of Babylon.
[1:12:05] And you know I think that's maybe a good
[1:12:06] way of looking at it. I know I'm going
[1:12:09] into Babylon and I'm going with the
[1:12:10] purpose to get gold out of it. I'm
[1:12:11] getting a paycheck. I'm not getting
[1:12:13] popularity. I'm not getting power. I'm
[1:12:16] not getting prestige. I'm not going to
[1:12:18] try to get uh um with to the use of
[1:12:21] iterations, prophecy or profits from it.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Right? I'm just trying to get what I
[1:12:26] need, the the substance, the good that
[1:12:28] God wants to give me. I want to know
[1:12:29] that it can come through those medians
[1:12:32] and be able to take it back to an
[1:12:33] alternative source and say that I know
[1:12:35] that no good thing comes but from God.
[1:12:38] in the mediums he uses it to give it to
[1:12:40] me. I'm not going to sanction the
[1:12:42] medium. I'm not going to say, "Oh, well,
[1:12:44] it's the will of God that we all go work
[1:12:46] here, we all go trade in Bitcoin, and we
[1:12:48] all try to find some currency to the
[1:12:50] moon." No. I'm going to trust God that
[1:12:53] he's the one that's providing. He's the
[1:12:54] one that's leading.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's see. Let's see. See,
[1:13:04] I will stop there.
[1:13:06] gives me something to preach Wednesday
[1:13:07] night. Gonna have a short service
[1:13:09] Wednesday night. Just like one, two,
[1:13:13] three, four scriptures maybe. Let's
[1:13:15] stand.
[1:13:18] Lord, help me.
[1:13:20] Help me. I'm surrounded by so many
[1:13:23] voices,
[1:13:24] so many mediums, so much mixed media.
[1:13:27] Help me to have the
[1:13:33] this spiritual canvas
[1:13:37] of the word and the spiritual materials
[1:13:40] of the word that are that are painting
[1:13:43] this masterpiece in my life.
[1:13:46] And as I go out into the world
[1:13:50] and [music] I employ worldly people or I
[1:13:52] have partners in business who are
[1:13:54] worldly and I have friends who forsaken
[1:13:58] the truth and maybe some who struggle
[1:14:02] with tremendous addiction and
[1:14:04] worldliness. Lord, I'm drinking from the
[1:14:06] fountain. I've got a source of pure
[1:14:08] life. Therefore, Lord,
[1:14:11] [music] I want to stay free of their
[1:14:12] poison, but Lord, I want to be a
[1:14:15] fountain that they can drink from,
[1:14:18] and it heals their poison.
[1:14:21] I want them to be healed.
[1:14:23] I don't want to [music] try to isolate
[1:14:26] myself
[1:14:28] a a and go into some sort of, you know,
[1:14:32] COVID 19 panic,
[1:14:35] have nothing to do with anybody and just
[1:14:38] try to [music] hide myself so I don't
[1:14:40] get sick. I said, "No, I've been
[1:14:42] inoculated."
[1:14:44] Right? You know, some people that they
[1:14:46] were so bold, the mask was off.
[1:14:49] They said, and they they just say, "I'm
[1:14:51] immune." Well, how do you know you're
[1:14:53] immune? Well, I've had five vaccine
[1:14:55] shots. I just had CO and [music] I
[1:14:57] currently have CO right now. So, I'm not
[1:14:59] worried about what you can give me,
[1:15:02] right? Well, in a spiritual sense, we
[1:15:04] can say, I know who I am as a son of
[1:15:06] God. I'm feeding. I'm strong. I'm
[1:15:08] robust. I I I I I'm very discerning
[1:15:10] about influences and these things in my
[1:15:12] life. And so I I I want to interact
[1:15:14] [music] with my fellow friends and
[1:15:16] brothers and co-workers in a way that
[1:15:18] can be a a voice that there is a tree of
[1:15:21] life.
[1:15:23] There is a tree of life. I'm drinking
[1:15:25] from a fountain that protects my spirit
[1:15:28] against all these negative influences
[1:15:29] out there. I have kind of integrity
[1:15:32] where someone can say, "Well, brother,
[1:15:33] how is it you live clean? How is it
[1:15:35] you're able to overcome? How is it
[1:15:36] you're not completely scared to death
[1:15:38] that Camala may run again or that a a a
[1:15:41] Hindu Muslim is going to become the
[1:15:42] governor or mayor of New York? Oh my
[1:15:44] goodness, what are we going to do in
[1:15:45] Phoenix if this guy becomes mayor of New
[1:15:47] York? How can you live at night and
[1:15:49] sleep at night knowing that that guy's
[1:15:51] going to run New York City?
[1:15:54] Well,
[1:15:56] uh let me just start. I'm a I'm a
[1:15:59] Christian.
[1:16:02] put one as a mayor of Phoenix and I'm
[1:16:04] not going to panic. As a matter of fact,
[1:16:08] elect
[1:16:09] invoke [music] Shahira law in Maricopa
[1:16:13] Island lands where it's Maricopa [music]
[1:16:16] County land. Go ahead and we're under
[1:16:17] Sharia law and have it governed by
[1:16:20] al-Qaeda. I'm going to serve God
[1:16:22] anyways.
[1:16:24] You see, Sister Elizabeth in Aura,
[1:16:26] you'll know why. But we're GOING TO
[1:16:28] SERVE GOD anyways
[1:16:31] because those things aren't my my I'm
[1:16:33] not drinking from that. And I don't want
[1:16:36] to start drinking that [music] Kool-Aid.
[1:16:37] I don't want to get that poison. And I
[1:16:39] want to become a voice that no matter
[1:16:40] how bad it gets out there, no matter how
[1:16:42] much everything gets mixed, there's
[1:16:43] [music] a pure source. Pure source.
[1:16:45] Let's pray for one another today. Pray
[1:16:48] for one another. Brother Rowan, brother
[1:16:49] Isaiah, maybe you could pray for each
[1:16:50] other right there. And families [music]
[1:16:52] could pray together. Esther, you could
[1:16:54] pray with your sister. Let's just pray
[1:16:55] for one another next to us. Let's pray
[1:16:57] and ask God to help us. Our gracious
[1:16:59] heavenly [music] father, Lord, we stand
[1:17:02] in a mixed age, a time when the pale
[1:17:04] [music] horse is leaving its imprint on
[1:17:06] the world. And Lord, we need you more
[1:17:08] than ever before. Lord, our lives are
[1:17:11] are so interconnected and intertwined.
[1:17:13] [music] There's a weaving together
[1:17:16] socially with unbelieving family with
[1:17:18] backslid [music] family. Our our lives
[1:17:21] are intertwined with business partners
[1:17:23] that aren't believers.
[1:17:24] So, I don't believe the word is telling
[1:17:26] us, not you got to cut ties, you got to
[1:17:27] ruin your business, you got to quit that
[1:17:29] job, you got No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:17:30] Lord, I don't think that's what the word
[1:17:31] is saying at [music] all. But the word
[1:17:33] is saying, what things are you are you
[1:17:35] feeding on?
[1:17:37] And what is what is the tree of life? Is
[1:17:40] it rooted, centered, and planted in your
[1:17:42] soil and in your garden so that [music]
[1:17:44] we become the source of life and
[1:17:46] strength for the poisoned in this world
[1:17:50] and that we can interact, Lord. We can
[1:17:53] enjoy certain [music] recreations. We
[1:17:54] can enjoy certain mediums, whether it be
[1:17:56] a gaming platform or movie night with
[1:17:58] the family. Lord, we're discerning.
[1:18:00] We're not silly doves just [music]
[1:18:01] watching anything. We're not just uh
[1:18:03] Ephraim on a burnt cake where we've
[1:18:05] given ourselves over to something to an
[1:18:07] extreme.
[1:18:09] And so, Lord, we have this
[1:18:13] experience that leads us [music] and
[1:18:14] guides us and washes us and purifies us,
[1:18:17] corrects us when we're wrong, keeps us
[1:18:18] in balance when we go too far. And
[1:18:19] that's my prayer [music]
[1:18:21] is purify our hearts, Lord. Help us to
[1:18:24] be more discerning as I've taken
[1:18:25] advantage of the people's kindness today
[1:18:27] and been rather lengthy.
[1:18:29] I thank you for their [music]
[1:18:30] attentiveness. And Lord, I know that in
[1:18:32] deal talking about social media, there
[1:18:34] may be somebody here, just a real
[1:18:38] sincere [music]
[1:18:38] person, a sweet person who begins to
[1:18:40] think that they're being called out.
[1:18:42] Lord, I don't know of anyone's social
[1:18:46] media presence here.
[1:18:50] I I I
[1:18:51] can honestly say I know that brother
[1:18:53] Martin Jones had a Twitter profile a
[1:18:56] long long time ago and I could assume he
[1:18:57] still does. But Lord, I'm not making any
[1:18:59] comments at all on anyone's [music]
[1:19:01] particular social media habits or what
[1:19:03] they've been saying and posting and
[1:19:05] liking and doing. Lord, I [music] have
[1:19:07] no presence on Instagram. Lord, I don't
[1:19:09] follow people and on Facebook. I have no
[1:19:12] Facebook account.
[1:19:14] Lord, there's there's this is not
[1:19:16] personal.
[1:19:19] Lord, you've dealt [music] with my heart
[1:19:20] and I just want individuals to just
[1:19:22] apply this in their own special way.
[1:19:25] Lord, if there be people here who make a
[1:19:27] living [music]
[1:19:28] uh leveraging social media, they have
[1:19:31] followers, Lord, use it for your glory,
[1:19:35] Lord. May their may their platforms be
[1:19:37] blessed.
[1:19:40] Lord, as it's necessary to have
[1:19:45] a a profile on X or necessary to have a
[1:19:48] Facebook page for our businesses, Lord,
[1:19:50] bless it, use it, harness it for good.
[1:19:54] Therefore, let us as we have voice,
[1:19:56] [snorts]
[1:19:57] as we like, as we subscribe, as we
[1:19:59] follow,
[1:20:02] may we be a tree of life, Lord.
[1:20:05] Just Lord, I I lay down no other law
[1:20:07] other than Christ,
[1:20:09] no other creed but Christ, [music]
[1:20:12] trusting that it'll be a tree of life to
[1:20:14] us and help us to be.
[1:20:17] Limit the detriments that come with the
[1:20:18] technology, the community, and the
[1:20:20] communication in this world by
[1:20:22] harnessing [music] all the good that you
[1:20:23] would want to come to us by it. We love
[1:20:25] you. I commit the people to you now in
[1:20:27] the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
