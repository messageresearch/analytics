TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um starting something different that I believe will be complementary to what we've been ministering on Divine Healing but I want to take a statement I believe that we've read already to this point brother Branham says in question and answers and healing is based upon faith not upon how righteous you are how good you are how much you keep the Commandments or whatever it is it's based solemnly upon faith we know that it's not an emotional workup it's not a mental tantrum that uh Faith healing is based solely upon Faith all things are possible to them that believe and he says it's not based upon how good you are and it makes this curious statement I think something that really causes us to really think hard about what he's referring to and how even it could it be that someone who's not even a Christian benefit from something that's only activated by faith when a Christian who is a Christian by faith can't seem to tap into it have you ever considered those things I confronted with the reality I'm a Believer and I pray and don't get what I I want but here's somebody who doesn't even believe and yet they can utilize Faith to activate a promise of God even to the point and I find myself already getting pulled into areas that I don't want to touch on but just make reference to it even to the point where brother Branham says that if someone approaches something believing that's God they can get something out of it because they they just take their faith and they project it towards something that is not not the truth necessarily or the source of God's power but God will honor that simple Act of Faith and that's what he's referring to here uh in part but yet a prostitute can come to the platform and be instantly healed and that's all by faith and a sainted woman crossed the platform and miss it he says sure it's based upon faith if thou can'tst believe not upon righteousness so there's some credit may be given to a sainted sister who's righteous who lives holy who has a life of conviction and a sainted woman and then someone who's not even living a holy life can come up and activate the faith necessary to be healed he says healing is just based upon faith and so my title I don't know how many services I may spend on this but my title is a matter of faith and I want to explore the subject of Faith as a compliment to the series Christ my healer and we're going to be gone for a few services and I'd like to pick back up on Christ my healer but I want to look at a matter of faith and my subtitle is ecstasy and I know that that may seem a little bit shocking but it may be for a point just to get your attention and as you I want this title just to stay up there for a moment before we go to our next quote when I say a matter of faith if healing is based upon faith we need to be sure that we don't have the false idea of faith and I and I believe those are the Dynamics that are at work when a prostitute can come through the prayer line and get healed but a sainted woman come right through the same prayer line with the same promise and he says and miss it and it's because maybe this is just conjecture on my part but the prostitute doesn't know anything other than the fact that God said he would heal her or that healing is being made available through that prayer line so it's just simple faith enough to believe that I'm here in need of prayer for my healing and she can receive it whereas the sainted woman has a lot more in her mind about what faith is which is a lot more teaching a lot more scripture a lot more experience a lot more services and so there's just a lot more things if I could say that could come into the picture and perhaps confuse faith we've used the phrase anecdotal Faith a few times and it's really just a term that I've used myself and so it's not necessarily something that would be rooted in you know some sort of theology or anything that brother Branham preached though there's uh instances that you could use at that phrase form but when I use the phrase anecdotal faith I'm just talking about something of Faith that's a belief that's been cultivated uh By Word of Mouth only and doesn't necessarily rest upon the word of God and so that anecdotal is just on the account of something and so when you have a faith that's just based upon someone else's personal I guess anecdotal would be in reality just something you base your belief or you base something solely upon someone else's account without backing it up without any research maybe scientifically they could talk about anecdotal evidence but and and just because it's anecdotal doesn't mean it's not necessarily true but when we say anecdotal Faith you're basing your belief on someone else's process you're basing your belief upon somebody else's results instead of the promise that brought the results and so when I talk about anecdotal Faith it's you as an observer see what someone else has has done and you're basing your faith on what's external as opposed to the the faith that was underlying the process the faith that was motivating to go through the prayer line the faith that was motivating them to have hands laid on them and that's what activated that's what brought the healing was the faith in the word of God and so anecdotals when we kind of strip the word of God out of it the real substance from it and only kind of view the process in the sermon be not afraid it is I brother Bram says Divine Healing is not a based based upon some emotion it's not based upon some laying on of hands or some strange feeling or sensation it's based upon a faith in a work that was done for you by Jesus Christ at Calvary it's a finished product it's based upon faith in a work it says it's a finished product now this next statement just opens up the channel that I'm wanting to look at and every person here tonight that is sick and Afflicted as far as God is concerned you are already healed so at the present in this and as he looks out upon his audience at that very moment there was the truth that there were people who were sick and afflicted so you could ask somebody how do you feel I don't feel very good um are you sick yes I'm sick it was their present experience it was their present reality but then he makes the statement as far as God is concerned or so from God's Viewpoint or from God's in God's opinion you are already healed recognize these two Vantage points then here they set presently sick but he's saying as far as God's concerned you are already healed and in that very statement I want you to see this layer how that brother Branham proposes a reality that's different than the one that the person is presently experiencing could be sitting there in pain sitting there sick sitting there Afflicted with a lifetime of miseries um Decades of diagnoses and years of surgeries and in months of procedures and and medicines and prescriptions and and that's all real you can grab the pill bottle and shake it you you feel the after effects of certain things by saying from a different Vantage Point as far as God is concerned or in his opinion you're not sick at all so when we say a matter of faith it is a play on uh the statement a matter of fact or as a matter of fact I think we're familiar with those two different statements a matter of fact or as a matter of fact a matter of fact if something belonging to the realm of fact as distinct from just an opinion or someone's guess something that doesn't really have a basis when you say it's a matter of fact you're asserting that there's some basis for it and it it's it's in the realm of fact to say as a matter of fact you're essentially saying in reality or actually so it's used especially if you're going to correct a lie or a misstatement or something that's not quite misrepresented right or some sort of misunderstanding someone says yeah it snowed yesterday in Flagstaff and maybe some would say well actually or as a matter of fact it didn't snow and so you're kind of trying to correct the record and I do believe that fact is different from truth and and I don't want to necessarily Veer into that but the fact is something that has actual existence and actual occurrence or somebody say an objective reality and so when we say as a matter of fact it's something that's actual it's something that has actually been done when you say in fact you're saying in truth in reality that's the way that it is it's not imagined it's not made up it's a fact has the quality of being actual and just to scratch uh this itch in the and law when there's a matter of fact juries are Trier is a fact they're the ones that determine fact and a matter of fact is that which is observed or that which is to be determined by the senses you determine by the census or by the testimony of witnesses who describe what they have perceived through the sense of sight smell touch taste or hearing so a witness is standing there and they're offering evidence that to a jury they're the Trier of fact and it's they're determining whether it's a matter of fact and it can only be based upon what someone perceives through their senses and that's what we'd say a matter of fact it's what I see it's what I hear it's what I taste what I smell and and it's something that has some basis in reality so now kind of playing off of that phrase a matter of fact or a mat uh in fact is a matter of faith when I say a matter of faith it presents a different realm of fact it presents a different realm of reality and I do not believe that I'm proposing a different view of Faith but I'm really wanting to be very um very focused on a particular aspect that we must give attention to and so I'm just going to step back for a moment and speak more to the common our common reality as humans uh to set up what I mean by a matter of faith Humanity proposes two different realities a subjective reality an objective reality and those you probably heard those terms before and I'd like to spend more time on some of these aspects as it relates to the word but let me just do this exercise so that we can consider this a subjective reality is coming from a single point of view or your own point of view to some today subjective reality may be that it's hot here it's hot in the sanctuary to others you might be cold and that's a subjective reality and it's kind of I think once you get into it it's kind of a related to your ego and the ego is kind of what mediates uh your uh the reality with how you feel and kind of coming to a sense of self and the way things are to you uh to have a subjective Viewpoint it's our own mental activity and how we perceive things and there's some that argue that's the only unquestionable fact of our existence is the way you view things it's what you you've heard the phrase perception is reality that's subjective if you perceive it to be cold that's probably your reality that it's that it's cold now objective on the other hand is suggests that it's not influenced uh by an individual feelings or personal opinion and that doesn't influence How You observe facts or how you how you consider something that's taking place and that's why objectivity is typically associated with uh truth reliability or reality and this is where at least from my standpoint knowing where I'm going this is where it kind of gets deep objective reality is the idea that there are Universal truths that apply to all independent of someone's subjective experience so no matter what you're experiencing there's this idea that there's something objective that is universal and so objective reality is independent of one's thoughts one's opinions one's feelings at least that's that's how they Define it but it's very problematic objective reality is perceived through five senses it's something that we are going to perceive with the senses of our body whereas the subjective reality relates to the the sensitivities of our minds we're processing it on another level and if I could say this to have an objective reality is to suggest that different observers can reconcile whatever differences they might have in their own subjective experience and for that to happen you have to make some assumptions and maybe the largest assumption is that there are actually Universal objective facts and then the second assumption is that we could all agree on them otherwise objective reality just kind of Falls in on itself and even then the fact that there could be an objective reality where we reconcile different subjective experiences it assumes that we have a freedom to choose our observations and that when we make are those observations and we're determining what's an objective reality that we're not actually influenced by the opinions of others there's some that argue that you actually don't have any you've never made a choice nothing's really your favorite but something in your life puts put put that steered you in that direction so oh my my favorite drink is Dr Pepper or my favorite food is this and you never actually chose that it was something that was imposed upon you and so there's a lot of assumptions that are related to this objective reality this common shared experience and so a matter of fact proposes something that is in reality a matter of fact at least attempts to suggest that we've established some objective truth or an objective experience but when I say a matter of faith I'm proposing an entirely different reality a reality that's not uh dependent solely upon human objectivity or even our own personal subjectivity a matter of faith I'm not saying it's independent completely but it's not Reliant it's not relying upon the setting aside of my subjective opinion in order to participate in some sort of objective thing but it's something completely different altogether and Revelations chapter 3 verses 17 to 18 and if you've survived through that part of it you can just kind of relax now but I do think that this idea of subjective objective and philosophy is trying to wrestle with what is truth and what is reality and what is existence and are we all just brains in a vat experiencing something and they're wrestling with reality they're trying to explain existence and and and it's it's why science at the end of the day just comes up with this conclusion that it's just absurd life is absurd it doesn't have any meaning but that's when you're looking at as a matter of fact but a matter of faith is completely different Revelations chapter 3 verses 17 and 18 I want to start here in uh bringing this out of the word here is the comment of the Alpha and Omega his observation regarding the church at laodicea because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isab that thou may have seen fellowship with brother Burley Williams recently and he was sharing with me that one of the outstanding characteristics of laodicea is they were known for their their the bomb that they made for eyes to anoint eyes and to be able to see and here's God taking something that may be in and that's just based upon the record that is at least shared uh by the historians that he's taking something that would have been known to them in a natural sense and he's flipping it around and putting it in a spiritual sense and he says that because this is so then I'm counting it by gold that you may be rich Raymond that you may be clothed shame of thy nakedness do not appear so Verse 18 is now remedy and remitting God's assessment in verse 17 and I said that you may see verse 17 if we could look at that I want to go back to that brother Joshua where he says Thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have needed nothing this is the subjective experience of the layout of sins in their assessment in their opinion and even in their experience they're rich and increase with goods and they are content is their state of mind it is what they perceive we could say that it's their subjective reality we may also argue that it's a conclusion based upon external factors and things that could be observed so maybe it's the objective reality um a shared reality of all laodiceans but this is their reality we're rich we're increased with goods and we're content but then God says and knoweth not so when he says and know it's not God Is providing a different account so you in your reality you're rich increase with goods and contempt but God in God's opinion according to God's account you're actually poor blind and naked and so the despite their actual existence In the Flesh God introduces a reality that contrasts their present state let's recognize it that way hey everything's great we don't need anything we're content we're happy we're rich we're thriving markets we have thriving economies we have access to all sorts of things we have if you have bad eyesight we've got bomb for that and we got close we got money we it everything's good we're rich increase with goods and that may be so from one vantage point from one perspective but God now upends their View like I say was a matter of fact we've got more money than anyone's ever had before as a matter of fact we've got more more uh treatments for diseases than any other time before as a matter of fact we have this as a matter of fact we have that as a matter of fact we have this but God is saying as a matter of faith you're naked it's a matter of Faith you're blind as a matter of Faith this is the reality and what God has done is he's turned he's upended their view of reality hey everything's great no actually it's not upon what basis in Acts chapter 17 verse 6 I'm just focusing on this one scripture because I want to recognize this phrase it says and when they found them not they're looking for Paul and Silas and and we're going to get to the comment here why they want to find Paul and Silas they drew Jason in certain Brethren under the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also this is the assessment of those that are wanting to lay hands upon Paul and Silas this is the assessment of them that grabbed a hold of Jason and the other Brethren and what they have declared is these men have turned our world upside down in other words what Paul inside us were preaching and what they were just demonstrating what they were doing upended their world view they they had a certain way of thinking a certain way of living a certain way of believing but now Paul comes preaching a gospel and declaring it with power and demonstration and this alternate reality is now upsetting their order we have a way of viewing things we have a way of believing certain things to exist we have a certain idea of how things are going to turn out but now he says they've turned the world upside down our system has been interrupted it's been it's been upended it's now there's an upheaval in the way that we thought things were because now is something something's acting out of pattern acting outside of our expectation so when the the world has a Viewpoint Rich increased with goods and content this is the way things are When Faith Comes it's actually introducing a different reality it's introducing a different order faith is the kingdom of God in the Kingdom of Heaven apart from the kingdom of man and we're touching on a facet of Faith the faith the faith of God's elect or his faith and not just a personal belief towards something if I could say this I meant to say it at the outset I'm really just trying I'm looking at the subject of Faith so if you could definitely pick a subject that you bite off more than you can chew faith is it and so it's not exhaustive and there's so many different Avenues of it brother I'm introduces at the very outset faith is based upon Divine Healing the Christian doesn't get it but the prostitute does that tells you that there's something varied about faith there's something very Broad and deep about it but I'm wanting to look at this reality is different from ours as being the faith in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 7. Paul says for we walk by faith not by sight in the reading of the scripture it's kind of this parenthetical phrase It's introduced as explanatory to what he's trying to say but it completely stands on its own he's saying just he could have just had eight one book right it could have just been a really short letter just a card that says in it you know to the church at Phoenix before we walk by faith not by sight and it just it Paints the full picture to walk as your course of life it is your order it's your the to walk is your occupation what you're occupied with it's the way you live and so we are occupied by faith this is a gigantic statement we walk by faith and I know that means something to us then we walk by faith it's almost as if it's something we're indicting it's something we're thinking about or something we hold in our minds to be reality but he's saying that we're directed and guided by this faith in the Bible it's translated to assurance and belief it's it comes from uh to be persuaded or persuasion and so we walk by faith it's a way of believing it's a way of perceiving now he walked the walk the life lived by faith is contrasted by sight and he says we walk by faith not by sight he's not referring to the act of vision but the superficial appearance of things the way things present themselves or what seems apparent we walk by faith not by sight not by the way things appear and again it's not just the Activision but the whole thing that's presented to us when we observe it and make conclusions based upon it if I look out upon the audience the fact could be someone's Fanning themselves and that's observable that's the act of vision but then I can perceive and observe and come to the conclusion that based upon that they're hot right based upon that the temperature may be high and he's saying that we walk by faith not by what seems to be apparent whether it be the objective reality or our subjective reality so in other words in our present state right now living and breathing in this body Faith supplants the reality based solely on human perception it it turns it upside down right now unfortunately that doesn't mean we disappear doesn't mean that all of a sudden we're living on another world but yet in where we are right now faith has the ability to turn what we're looking at around and see it completely different than how humans see it humans are living and acting within a reality with certain senses and certain perceptions and certain agreements certain assumptions about the way things are but when you live a life by faith it's pointing to an actual existence that transcends the subjective human existence we're here but yet it's Transcendent it it's not confined to this literal Physical Realm So Divine faith is different from your subjective reality as a human being it's different from the objective reality that's presented in the world and where we're going in society today is the acceptance that there really are no objective truths that are Universal but everyone is allowed to perceive themselves and the world as they want to so regardless of what would be objective in science or observable people can identify as whatever they want there's really no there's no absolute truth or universal truth So Divine faith is is different from this faith is not what you believe according to your subjective reality and I want to be careful with that statement but it's just what you what you see or what you think what you're feeling what your emotions are telling you you see something You observe it and that's not the product of Faith that's not what we're pointing to for faith is not what we believe based upon the acceptance of an objective reality or acknowledgment of an objective reality faith faith is a belief it is a conviction it is an assurance based upon a reality beyond the normal range of Human Experience that's what real genuine faith is it's a faith that's based upon a reality that's not soul that does not solely exist within what I feel faith is based upon something beyond what I'm thinking what I'm feeling my emotions and and what's physical Faith then is Tethered to something and based upon something that goes beyond I use the phrase transcends it goes beyond what I see goes beyond what I feel goes beyond what I think it goes beyond my opinions now those emotions may agree with that but Faith isn't the sum of that if we walk by faith not by sight it is a different reality than the human existence Paul says in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 I am crucified with Christ so the conclusion is your dad nevertheless I live okay then he says yet not I but Christ liveth in me you might read this and think well why didn't why didn't he just backspace and change it uh why didn't but it's it's to pres it was I'm sure he could have marked it out but he want this emphasis that I am living but it's not me living as I lived before but Christ liveth in me I'm crucified and Dead with Christ but I'm still living and it's not just the me that was before but Christ is living in me and the life which I now live in the flesh the the the the intentional phrasing to say that I'm alive still in this flesh a flesh that sees and tastes and smells and hears and the imagination conscience memory reason and affection all these all these uh senses that relate to the mind and the body I still have all those faculties I still have that capacity but the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me he says the life that I now live I live by the faith I'm living a life by the Faith of Christ and this life that he's now living that's living by faith is not a new mental process but it is a this faith is the product of the revelation of a Divine reality Paul was living his life he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he understood the law he understood the writings he understood the history all that was given orally all that was given traditionally all that was observed physically everything that they had been given Paul was a believer in I had certain assumptions about how that all the all the prophecies would be translated in the future so Paul lived and regulated his life after that he says as touching all blameless and that was the way Paul viewed things and observed things but now he says the life I'm crucified with Christ and the life that I now live in the flesh I'm living by the faith of the Son of God Paul is saying that now something has come and completely changed the way I see things and it has been this this faith that he had that he's now living by was the result of the revelation of a Divine reality apart from the reality as a nation apart from the reality as an Israelite so the faith of the Son of God refers to an existence or a New and Living Way as Paul put it that was introduced by Jesus Christ so Christ then is that door to this different way of thinking different way of viewing John chapter 8 verse 23 and he said unto them you are from beneath I am from above year of this world I am not of this world he's wanting to he's wanting to create a very distinct dichotomy between the way they viewed things and the way he viewed things they view things a certain way because of their origin he was the way he was and viewed things the way he did because of his origin you are from beneath not only the Earth but influenced of hell he said you are of your father the devil and he brings it back to the beginning you are from Beneath You're of this world sir not only of the Earth but you're from your influence of hell you are but I am from above I am not of this world I have existence I am from I am the this is when he makes that phrase It's a being it's an existence so they existed within this realm of the Earth but he's saying that I am from above there's a different order of things than how you perceive things there's a different reality I am from above something that actually exists brother Bradham says in a man running from the presence of the Lord there never was a creature like him he lived in a world to himself he was born outside of the realm of the natural sinful man born outside of a realm he was born outside of these matter of facts better man talked about him in perfect Faith he was a Mystic to others with his perfect faith that's where this phrase Mystic it's something that seems to be beyond what humans would grasp and Beyond what we would consider to be uh rational Behavior he is a Mystic anyone with perfect faith is a Mystic to the world Jesus Continuum in John chapter 7. are actually just prior I guess to say maybe not continuing but just hitting rewind a little bit then Jesus cried in the temple as he taught saying you both know me and you know whence I am and I am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom you know not but I know him for I am from him and he hath sit in me you both know me and you know whence I am on on some level using some language and some apprehension and some knowledge you know him and you know where he came from but you don't know he says but I am not come of myself I didn't send myself but I have been sent by someone else and he that sent me is true and you don't know him so you might have some conclusion based upon an external reality based upon your observances and based upon a fact that I was born of a woman and I have brothers and I have a father on this Earth and you may know me after that end and we could just say that's true regardless of whether or not that's what he's referring to but he then touches on this he that sent me you don't know him but I do because I'm from them and he says he that sent me is true now that's it means real and genuine you are from beneath you are from the world I am from him that is true to this word alathenos it means that which contrasts it's contrasted to the appearance of reality something real true genuine not only just the name and the resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name so it's not just the appearance of life but it's real life talks about it how can you how can thy loving kindness be better than life and he touches on how there's a perverted life there's the appearance of life there's a Vitality that relates only to those things which is temporal but there's an actual existence that is greater than this one so when he says he's true he's contrast the appearance of what is real the appearance of reality God is reality and Truth brother Branham says in unfailing realities of God stay with God stay with realities God is a god of reality he says God is a god of reality just don't take a Creed don't take a sensation take a reality take a real God something that God is a god of reality that gives you assurance now it this again this is uh the world turned upside down because if you wanted um something of assurance you'd probably go by a sensation if you want to know that it's not raining outside maybe a good way to figure that out is to all right go outside and experience it and have your senses contacted and that would bring the reality that it's it's not raining but he's saying don't take a Creed don't take a sensation take a reality God is the god of reality and that reality gives you an assurance what is it gives you Faith it's assures so Jesus says he that sent me is reality I Come From Reality I come from that which is real true and genuine that which contrast your appearance and perception of reality in John chapter 14 verses 1 to 6 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions this is actual existence God's thoughts are Eternal they are real that's not true of our thoughts we can have thoughts about things that will never come to actual existence but God's thoughts are at actual reality if it were not so I would not have told you I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also think of how he's trying to pull their minds into something Beyond themselves my father's house are many mansions many Tabernacles I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and then Thomas is drawn into this explanation exclamation Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way if you're going to a place we don't know where you're going how true that was we've never experienced it we don't know what this place is our reality is this is the promised land this is where God has placed us this is where we have the Feast of Tabernacles this is where we celebrate our feasts we return back to Jerusalem we have a lifestyle we have an order we have a system we have an existence we have promises we have Redemption we have jubilees we have restoration we have the promise of a messiah who'll come and restore us back to our own autonomy and individuality and freedom this is life what do you what do you mean you're going to go to a place and come back to take us there where is this place is this not the promised land is this not reality we don't know where you're going so how can we find the way Jesus said I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me you cannot come unto him which is true but by Christ you cannot see this reality except through Christ I am the way it's the course of life literally in the Greek the manner of thinking feeling and deciding I am the way of thinking feeling and deciding I am the truth that that which is really true in any matter under consideration I am the truth so in any situation find Christ that's what is true I am that which is really true in any matter under consideration I'm free from falsehood I I am in actuality I am the way the truth and the life the absolute fullness of life it's Zoe life real and genuine Christ says it of himself Revelations 3 7 I am he that is true he that is real I am the way the truth the life that's everything the way truth life that's existence that the way there is no going without the truth there is no no one without life there is no living this is this is life summed up in these three different aspects I am the way the truth in life if you want to come to the father this is how you get there Christ is he that is true brother Madam in the church age book writes now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that it is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization so there can be some partial reality a partial truth and it's upon that basis that people can see things and believe it's upon that that we begin to say well this must be so and that must be so but to be true it's not just the opposite of what is false but it expresses a perfect realization of something as different from its partial realization human existence is a partial reality I think that's maybe just the the easiest amen right human existence is the part is a partial reality in the Lael descent Church age he writes recall that it does not mean true that you recall that it does not mean true as in contrast with false it has a richer deeper meaning by far we say something is true we just think oh well truth is different from false truth is you know is what's uh you know what is actual versus what is just an opinion or something without basis he says it's deeper than that it's a deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial realization in the same way faith has a deeper and richer meaning it's more than just why you don't believe and you believe it's more than just doubt or faith it has a a deeper richer meaning it's not just well we think of Faith this is how we think of faith faith is knowledge uh based upon little or no evidence that's almost how we Define it faith is just what I believe absent any proof to the contrary and I'm not being dismissive of that but if we take Faith to be only knowledge and the absence of some proof faith is deeper than that faith is richer than that that's why people can believe for things that are not rooted in any reality whatsoever and then never see it because they've just limited the definition of faith to just believe something that has no actual existence well how do you know that I just believe it and you reduce Faith to that that mere human mechanism alone but faith is more than that Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen things hoped for Things Not Seen but yet promised and guaranteed by God faith is the substance of those promises you hope for faith is the evidence of things guaranteed by God that you do not see of yet the definition you could have the substance and the Greek means has actual existence faith is the actual existence of things hoped for faith is the evidence that means the conviction of the reality of something so this is how faith when I'm using the word transcends you may be limited by your senses but faith is the is the substance it is the evidence Faith comprehends as a full reality what cannot be experienced by physical senses what I cannot say what I cannot touch what I cannot hear what I cannot imagine whatever is partial reality I I see it but I don't see it totally I feel it but I don't understand completely Faith comprehends as a full reality what your senses cannot grasp brother Branham writes it this way back in the Philadelphia Church age uh chapter 8 since this word expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and substance with shadow so this life is a shadow this life is a negative so there there's something representative to it but there's another life that's the full development of it take the example now of Manna From Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day it was left around it became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from heaven factual in John chapter 6 they said our fathers ate man in the wilderness and Moses gave us this bread and Jesus said well as a matter of fact he did right God did as a matter of fact give you bread from heaven but I am the true Bread of Heaven yeah there's some re that's rooted in some reality that's based upon some history some actual existence but but I am in the true Bread of Heaven whereof Manna was just a type and if any man me if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no no need any longer for a shadow this is referring even to the law then no need for partial salvation one that you could have a blood Covenant until the next year the next offering no need for partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus is a part of God he is God it's the perfect realization there can be partial but he's saying this is the true what is true in second Corinthians chapter 5 verses 15 16 and 17. speaking of Christ Christ is a life that I now live I live by the faith of the son of God the Faith of Christ is is something that Christ has brought to us if I could even say this it may have been typed before but never actual existence until he came there may be a shadow of it maybe in types of even in Joseph a perfect shadow but not the reality of it it even it even memorializes and honors the faith that the uh the the forefathers had the faith of Moses the faith of job the faith of the of those who were believed before Christ came second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 15 and speaking of Christ and that he died for all that they which live shouldn't not henceforth live unto themselves he died that we who are still living no longer exist within a subjective reality but unto him which died for them and rose again we don't live just one dimensionally we don't live just egotistically we live unto Christ wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we may have we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth no we know we him no more you may have known him by physical sight you may known him by personal interaction in this flesh but now you don't know him that way anymore you know him by Revelation you know him by faith and he says now we know no man after the flesh now our knowledge this is this is the part to me that just starts this domino effect he's wanting to shake us a little bit to say now you've got to view things differently for now we don't know other people the same way that we did when we lived unto ourselves but now that faith has been instigated we have a different vantage point therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature this this uh my understanding of this scripture has just blossomed over this past week if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new there's there's when you say old things are passed away all things have become new I know we can wrestle with this because we say well if I'm truly born again why did I struggle with this and why did this happen how come everything isn't completely revolutionized but a new creation implies a new existence it's not as as Nicodemus wrestled with it so how do I how do I come back into this world again no Jesus is talking about Paul tomorrow if any man be in Christ by one Spirit you're baptized into this Mystic Body of Christ and and when if that has happened you are a new creation the way things were is now turned upside down all things are become new because now you should not live unto yourself and you should not view others the same way you should have a complete different reality all things are passed away the present order can never be the same blessed me so much because the way you say all things are become new it it's not that everything has disappeared all trials are gone all Temptations are gone but you know it if you've ever been born again you always see it differently from that moment on but every all things have become new because I've been baptized into Christ the present order things can never be the way that it was before it's exposed as partial it's exposed as temporary it's exposed as being not expedient it's exposed as being Earthly it's exposed as being corruptive I can never I can never see it the same way again do I make mistakes yes but all things have become new I can't justify that I can't make excuses for that my whole view has changed that's what it means when All Things become new I'm out of my old way of thinking my old way of viewing my whole course of life has been upended [Music] that's what Jesus meant when he said in John 3 3 verily verily I said to thee except a man be born again what from above above not from Below you are from beneath you are of This World by the birth you had in this world but to be born again from above now causes you to come to exist in a different reality the body's still here but something's been birthed in a different reality when brother Brown preaches future home your Soul's already there you can just take future home and read through and be like Soul Eighth Day Already There Brother Branham is almost even skipping the millennium it's so certain and so sure Soul's already there Soul's already there it's just gonna take a million for your for everything to catch up to where your Soul's at Born Again from above if except unless a man be born again from heaven he cannot see the kingdom of God what does that understand unless you're born again you're only ever observing in this realm unless you're born again you can only see the external appearance of the kingdom of God as it's manifested by those who are existing in another reality because the new birth it brings a new existence it brings a new reality it's supernatural extra rational it's the true Uber it's beyond to be born again is not to I kind of have a change in mind Born Again In this present world as a convert to a religion uh it's changing my pattern of behavior to a new discipline or a new way of thinking if that's so every time we went from keto to carnivore diet to this and to that and from vegan to gluten-free to the pescetarian to vegetarian that would all be births right I've been born again 817 times because that's that's all the times I've changed my my discipline of eating it's all the times I changed my thought process that's all the times I changed my opinion but to be born again is different than that to be born again is to be birthed into another dimension of living another dimension of reality what is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you so there is now a subjective reality that is beyond that is beyond the reality presented by your mental thinking beyond the senses of imagination conscience memory reason and affection beyond what you feel beyond what you see beyond what you taste beyond what you hear the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you [Applause] it's a complete different reality in Ephesians chapter 3 verse verses 14 to 19. oh what beautiful prayer for this cause I bow my needs into the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named there's the reality the family of Heaven with this with this manifestation on Earth that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man that Soul person where you really exist the real you that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith no I can almost see this as a filling up this this strengthened by his spirit that Christ may not dwell in your hearts by faith that ye been rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints this is the prayer so this is Paul's prayer to the Ephesian Church Born Again filled with the Holy Spirit that there could be a dwelling of Christ and by faith with this foundation with this root that they're going to be able to comprehend with All Saints so that now my subjective reality according to the faith and by this new birth experience begins to become common with all other Saints and we comprehend we grasp we come to know what is the breadth and length and depth and height I want to come back to that and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge to know the love of Christ to have a knowledge of the love of Christ that passes knowledge which you talk about something higher a higher knowledge higher wisdom higher Revelation higher understanding not carnal which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God that whatever partial reality still has preeminence would be completely assumed by the perfect reality and when he says the breadth the length depth and height everything that is tangible to us exist in three dimensions height length width you can touch it that it exists within those three dimensions in physics there's three spatial dimensions you can only move up right or forward you say no no that's not true you can only move up right or forward to go to the left is the negative of going right it's the same plane it's the same Dimension to go down is just the negative of going up to go back is just the opposite of going forward you can only move three different ways within life within within the dimensions we live in and I want to save it for another time brother I'm talking about how we live in light time and matter so Paul says that we may comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height this is a language that would be used to describe the elements of human existence what is forward what is to the left to the right up and down this is this kind of describing anything that has tangible reality this exists three-dimensionally all right you look at us well this is this is a three-dimensional object let me experience it and then he says the breath it's the extent of it so it's not creating in this in this way it's not necessarily creating a fourth dimension but when Paul uses this language height depth and length when he mentions that it's a language that would describe our present reality but he's not referring to Natural Life he's not saying that we would come to comprehend better spatial existence I unfortunately he's not praying that we'd get a good grade in physics but he says that we may comprehend with All Saints the breadth the extent of the length and depth and height of what Christ he desires that we would know he's described in the reality of God In terms that so we could relate that just as much as things here are real because as spatial tangible existence there is a reality of Christ that has height and depth and length and breath there's a reality that you can comprehend you can grab a hold of this desk you can recognize this scene you can experience Dimensions moving up and down left and right backwards and forwards in this life says that you may comprehend in not just you but everybody else that reality in God faith is a mental is is a mental state Beyond human reason faith is a state of mind Beyond human rationale so it's a new reality Now using this phrase that transcends your natural existence money in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 6 what does he say based upon this reality and hath raised us up together in a place that by God's grace being rooted and grounded up we may grow to comprehend together was the breath length and depth and height we're sitting in heaven places in Christ Jesus and Paul's like oh if you could just see the depth of it if you could see the height see the length you could see the breath this is where you are but it's not a full reality like it should be this is the absolute truth he's raised you up by the new birth you're raised up together and has made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus think of Faith then as being a a state of being think of Faith as an existence that is tied or connected with the perfect existence you have been raised up seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now this this little building uh and the cramped space that we have here and this low ceiling it makes me look really tall fortunately but maybe it doesn't at all maybe just emphasize just how short I am when brother Phillip just stood here and like wow that's a really low sale and I get up you're like he's short but this the reality is we're seated in heavy places and that that reality has to Dawn greater because that's that's that this is a faith connected with the perfect existence brother Brown said no greater than Solomon is here we're sitting in heavy places in the presence of Christ lifted above the cares of the world into a realm of Faith the kingdom a domain of Life a realm of faith seated together in Heavenly places a realm of Faith that's where we live in him we live and move and have our existence in him Ephesians 4 13 what is what are all the gifts that are given to men what are all what's all the preaching for what what are all the what's it to do till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God and unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ what is all the preaching of the word in settings like this what is what is it all for that we could come into the unity of the faith that we may be able to comprehend with All Saints the unity of the faith the word has to be preached until our realities are entirely unified in the reality of Christ this reality has to be unified in Christ raised up is a realm Heavenly places the realm of faith in Galatians chapter 3 verse 23. but before Faith came we are kept under the law this is such a reality to Paul before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up under the faith which should afterwards be revealed Christ is the author and finisher of this faith Christ introduced the faith to the Christian Church Christine when they introduces this Transcendent Faith it's it's different than even what the Jews were expecting so at this in this language Christ they were under the law and the law had a certain order in a certain system and it was there they were shut up unto until the faith which which should be revealed later Christ revealed the faith kept under a reality until a new reality is revealed by Christ shut up unto kept under held in prison under the bondage of it until Faith which was later revealed I I want to I want to finish my thought here if it I may just want to speak in general terms so I could go take this a step further I I will just I'll just allude to it faith is a complete revolution of our character because once you know no man we don't live unto ourselves and we know no man after the flesh something's taken place where your entire existence shifts even as it relates to yourself to your neighbor to the world that's that's what faith is there's an idea that faith is a discipline you're a Christian by your faith and and there's some it's some sort of just something that's an additive to the human existence but genuine faith is a revolution of your character how you perceive yourself how you view your neighbor how you view the world faith is power to live above the world so faith is it is to sense and to know and to act in terms of a supernatural reality that's what faith is I sense I know I act under the law and the rule of a different reality I sense according to the laws of a different Kingdom I act according to the laws of a different Kingdom I know according to the laws of a different Kingdom the humanity can see things one way and that can be a subjective reality or it could in fact be an objective reality but you're on the other side looking at it so that you can sense it know it and respond to it differently than any unborn again person can at least you ought to and that's what Revelation does revelation does what it uncovers what previously had been hidden here you've lived in this world your whole life interacting with things but whenever Revelation comes all of a sudden you see even your whole life differently did it not happen to you you lived and in the moment that this word became a living reality you even begin to see what you experienced before differently like wow how did I ever miss it how did I never see it why because it's uncovered what you did not sense are no humanly before that's what Revelation does revelation is the complete turning upside down the complete upheaval of human thought that's a state of mind behind Beyond carnal carnal reason so when I use the subtitle ecstasy it's a scriptural word literally means in the Greek a displacement so you have you have in existence and you have an experience they have emotions but an ecstasy is a displacement a state in which normal functions are superseded and actually as it drives out senses but Paul uses the word whether I be beside myself so you have yourself and then you're beside yourself you have your existence but then this ecstasy is a displacement of existence extasis is the Greek it means entrancement astonishment removal from proper place and one way it's referred to as an insanity because it's something that's beyond rational so there's a use of it that can explain maybe a behavior that is sub-human but an ecstasy is a displacement and when in Revelations chapter 1 verse 10 as he could kind of breathe breathe a sigh of relief I've made it to my text that means at least I'm there now says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet I am Alpha and Omega first and last I was in the spirit I was in a state of ecstasy I had been influenced the the influences of the outer realm what I see what I taste what I see what I smell all these senses that declared this Natural Life have now been diminished and I'm now in a realm that's beyond what I see I'm not just on the Isle of Patmos I'm not just having a human experience but now I have I am in the spirit and the influences and the perceptions that contact the outer realm have now been diminished and it's in that state that he caught the revelation of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit I was in an ecstasy brother random says I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life I was in the spirit is the Hall of the Christian Life the Christian faith the Christian Life is a displacement of natural life I was in the spirit he said the whole of the Christian Life the whole of the Christian faith is an ecstasy it's the subjection of the natural to the supernatural it's a displacement I don't know I don't just live here anymore this isn't this is not this is not where I live this world is not my home in that I'm only contacting my Earthly home through these certain senses there's now another sense faith is an Awakening of The Sixth Sense to contact and live in another dimension the displacement ecstasy is to be carried away what it what is rational what is normal and I know that it may seem to be a little bit of a shocking a a shock to use that word and I'm sure some people are trying to come up with a lot of drug puns for me later but it's a it has a basis in the scripture because we're confined by light time and matter in a language to try to describe something that's beyond language and so anything that has a language anything that could be used in human language can have the opposite effect that there's a there's a way that we use language it doesn't make sense anymore literal is figurative now that in this sense that there's a this ecstasy is you now have been transported there's a there's something you're experiencing something beyond what is normal the human existence billabam talks about that word coming to you says quickly you're raptured up to meet it and now you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ what's happened you've been carried away you've been raised up seated in Heavenly places this is what faith is I was in the spirit you're carried away and I was in ecstasy and when that happens you're a Mystic to the rest of the world it stuck down here in this realm the very word rapture you can't find Rapture in the scripture as far as a translation of a word but it's the act of carrying off forever said you're quickly your rap up to meet it harpazzo in the New Testament means to catch away first Thessalonians caught up together it's a catch in a way what is it it's a rapture it's a Rapture it's rapturous it's a it's a feeling of being uh of the static static it's I'm being lifted up I've been raised them up with my feelings I I had pain I feel sick I feel like I'm dying I have a headache I have I'm not sure what's gonna happen Revelation comes what happens you're raised above that I I I believe I feel better I'm gonna get well there's a that's why I have your elevated the natural above the natural realm oh my it takes the phrase rapturing faith and gives it a much deeper more personal and practical meaning in this light of what faith is to be transported brother Brown says in the message Rapture but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her the catching away the displacement he says the Rapture is a revelation the true bread of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the Revelation is faith cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't that's actual existence it's been revealed to me anything that would declare it otherwise you could say it's contrary because you have a reality that contrasts it that's what faith is now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God once Christ has been revealed to you once God is revealed to you that Supernatural that supernaturality becomes a matter of faith that's what that's that's exactly what happens and it's just as real to you as somebody else who experiences this life to their senses they contact natural things and to be born again is now to be introduced to a god who's the god of reality and then it becomes a matter of faith brother Branham says in the sermon he cares to you this this is um I'm gonna I'm gonna go very quickly and just wrap this up so there's going to be some things that you're just going to be left to uh keep holding your heart and consider I think I'm just speaking to what you already know anyways but he says when you find God's ultimate faith is a revelation of God when you find God's ultimate his word a promise Upon A Certain thing you must know first that it is God's word that the thing that you're seeing being done is God there's no maybe so it could be it looks like it might be it is God then when you get to that spot then that's the pearl of great prize you must get away from everything that anybody else tells you contrary to it you must not look to what man has achieved you must look to what God has said and what he promised and see him to do it so you have the achievements of man that can only exist within the the dimensions the spatial dimensions of physics and in this reality but then you look to what God has promised he says then that's your ultimate right there catch that that's the ultimate and everything that you are everything that you were or was everything that you hope to be must be placed upon this just as those death and life to you at that moment wow in that when that that ultimate this is how he's describing this ultimate everything you are everything you were everything you will be is based upon that word it's based upon as though it's death and life to you at that moment when you look at it in this sense like the idea of desperation that's your ultimate faith is connected with what one perceives to be the greatest need faith is connected with what one perceives to be the ultimate priority when you see that that's your ultimate ultimate what the ultimate priority the ultimate need the ultimate thing it's the absolute why is it the absolute because everything I was everything I am and everything I will be is based upon that that's what brother Brown's trying to get us to understand in the in the sermon the absolute that the word must be your absolute it is your ultimate everything that you were everything you are everything you would be Carly would be based upon one's subjective reality it'd be based upon what you agree to be an objective reality what I was maybe that could be objectively verified what I am maybe that's my subjective reality what I will be well it's all going to be based upon the Confluence of these things whatever it has been and what I am is working to make what I am but brother I'm suggesting something completely different he said faith is not a hope so or it could be right it's got to be absolutely amen it's your ultimate it's your absolute it's the thing that you're tied to what is Faith then it is your reality genuine faith is when you make God's word you're absolute that's when you say this is my ultimate concern faith is what I believe to be the absolute faith is what I believe to be the the ultimate faith is the ultimate meaning of life Faith is the ultimate need faith is the ultimate concern that's what faith is and if it really is Faith it changes the way I act you can always tell what someone believes to be when someone has a faith and it's real Faith well genuine human belief and conviction and this one they they act as if everything matters and everything depends upon it why are you worried about that why are you doing that they're convinced about it and that's what an ultimate is Faith is you're absolute it's the thing you're tied to it's everything it's your reality faith is when you make God's word you're absolute what is the word it's God's subjective reality the word is the way God sees things right the word is the One Singular Viewpoint of everything God's viewpoint amen and it's the real viewpoint musicians please come brother Brian said in that in the message in absolute a absolute and that's the mat what's the matter in the Christian faith today we got too many traffic jams everybody making their own absolute right all the people in the in the Crossway showing a bad trying to direct traffic everybody trying to be an absolute he says when you've got one absolute and that's the word of the Living God that settles it forever no matter what anybody else says it's almost got into a place like it was in the day of Judges everybody has their own absolute but it all fails like the Pharaohs and so forth but God's absolute is his word that's the ultimate that's what faith is that that that word of God that reality and so Faith then is to live to be carried away into that ecstatic Realm and that's where we want to live don't you want to live there all the time don't you want to stay there that's what this word is all about that's what the renewing of the mind is all about that's what the pressing forward is all about that's what all the Supernatural is all about calling you into that place of perfect existence God bless you let's stand
