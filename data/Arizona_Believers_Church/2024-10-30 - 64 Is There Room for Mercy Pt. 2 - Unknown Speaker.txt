TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Galatians chapter 3 we'll start with verse one we'll read to verse 11 oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ ha been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that min to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him of righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith amen you can be seated just jump right back into the subject we're ministering on Sunday on is there room for mercy and I kind of I had to stop just right in the middle of it so I'm just going to try to find a way to get right back to where we were um in the morning service and continue this morning but Mercy is from the root word to be good uh to be kind and so Mercy is goodness kindness or faithfulness and that's really at the heart when we say is there room for Mercy we really are looking at all those different aspects but if you look at Psalms 103: 13 and 14 just take a few moments to review a few principles from Sunday says like as a father pth his children so the Lord pth them that fear Him and that pth in the Hebrews to love deeply to be compassionate to have tender affection it means to have mercy if you have love and compassion and tender affection there's that kindness that goodness that faithfulness to one so we know that love and faith are relations so this as a father pies his children the Lord pies them that fear Him and this scripture even later refers to the mercy of the Lord so it's bound up in this pity and then in verse 14 it says for he knoweth our frame he remember that we are dust and this pity that he has for them that fear Him is connected with this knowledge and wisdom and understanding that he has about us and our weaknesses and our shortcomings and I would say even our desires and our hopes and so Mercy relates to knowledge it relates to having wisdom or the true understanding of things when you look at someone and you see them for what they are you can pity them and I know sometimes we think of way oh what a Pity what a Pity but this Mercy or this to be pitiful towards someone or to pity someone is kind of rooted in knowing where they're at and what they're going through and what they've experienced and so he knoweth our frame he remembers that we are dust and so therefore based upon the knowledge of where we are he has this Mercy or this pity now in Hosea chapter 6: 6 to 7 we were using this to kind to link together uh the subject we were on when the youngans don't grow up and how that uh though we may be born when we're born again by this experience with the Holy Ghost uh there's a certain enthusiasm there's a moving and work of the holy spirit in our lives and some people can be natured a certain way as we saw in the word of God to where they're more prone to certain expressions and certain ways of worship but at the end of the day what is most important is that you continue in the word of God and you grow and you mature in the word and it says in verses 6 and 7 for I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings but they like men have transgressed the Covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me so in dealing treacherously against God uh they have not uh they have not shown him Mercy or kindness or goodness they have not been faithful to him and he says I desired Mercy not sacrifice I I desired that there' be the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings that's quite a statement especially given the amount of time that God put into establishing the order of worship and sacrifices and offerings and the Tabernacle in the wilderness and the Temple of the Lord uh but yet here here God is saying at the end of the day I wasn't just trying to create ceremony I just wasn't wanting to create tradition but I wanted to manifest mercy and kindness and goodness and the knowledge of me the knowledge of the Holy and in the house of the Lord as we just kind of reference this very quickly on Sunday offerings and sacrifices are what dominated the outer court and the inner court and the holy place you have the outer Court the inner Court which is sometimes called the holy place in the outer Court you had the Brazen altar you had the Laver and you had different activities at these at these stations and then you had in the inner Court incense and the lamps and the table of showbread and in there we see that there's the light uh uh there's light from natural light then there's the light of man as you light these lampstands and there's a lot of different language that even brother brandom uses and in this layout of the Tabernacle in the wilderness and even Solomon's Temple you can see the body is expressed where you have the Flesh and the spirit representing those two courts and and in the outer Court you have the natural light and the inner Court you have man-made lights you see the man-made you see the influence of man-made elements and man-made things and natural things but then after the outer Court the inner Court of that Holy place you come into the most holy place you come into the holiest of holies and it held only the ark and the Ark itself was one thing that would include the actual Ark that contained the the law but then also The Mercy Seat which is then attached to it forever becomes a part of it and so that Most Holy Place only held the ark which is truth and mercy and that place represents the soul of man the meeting place the place where God wants to dwell the place that God finds rest so these two uh courts the outer and inner Court The Works of man dominate in there but God's presence dwelt in the Shak Glory dwelt between those choms that was his dwelling place now as we have been studying myself personally and we tried to emphasize a number of things in that stre report series from 1965 I like to I'm drawing a lot of inspiration or there's a deep connection to works as Faith expressed and and so as I go together in this today I I'd like for you hopefully some of you to be drawing from what you've learned and what you've been taught in that sermon as the prophet lays out just a beautiful uh teaching on works as Faith expressed and he addresses how that he's addressing emotions and gifts and Pentecostalism and those things in that series and he's showing how that the word there's a word work that we're doing in this end time and it's according to a seed and there's certain impersonations but there are things that Satan cannot impersonate that's a real uh deep principle in that or an obvious principle in that sermon and as we go further we used Galatians chapter 3 so if you don't just look at that right now this will help us move down a little bit in Galatians chap 3: 1 to4 the the correction by Paul of the galatian church is an appeal to grow up he's really he's not taking away their experience he's saying you are you have received the spirit and you are seed and you are children of God but he's really challenging them to grow up and he's using the truth but also mercy and he says oh foolish Galatians and he calls them foolish they had not properly developed they have not grown up and because they have not grown up they're so easily Charmed or influenced oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ had evidently been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith are ye so foolish again he's he's wanting to bring them back to this this immaturity and this susceptibility to the wrong kind of influence having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh so he's not taking their experience away from them he's just saying you're not developing or going forward in your experience properly because somebody is enticing you and seducing you to leave the prin principle of the word of God working inside of you and wanting to do something outwardly to appease the Lord and so he says have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain suffering is that process of character development and so this is something uh that Paul is advocating for them to grow and to grow up and to mature and he asked this question in verse two and he could say it this way did you receive the Spirit by performing The Works of the law or did you receive it as a seal of your faith how did you re received the Spirit by keeping the law and doing what the law demanded of you or is it something that you received by faith and because they had forgotten this principle or because they weren't in tune to the real work of God in their hearts they were not walking in the spirit as you go forward and reading the rest of it you'll see that they're not obeying the truth and they're not really manifesting the real fruit of that experience that they had had in Galatians 5: 6 to8 it says for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision they were being called back tradition they were to tradition they were being called back to works of the flesh but the only thing that avails is Faith which worketh by love he says you did run well so they had obviously been doing some good things he says who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion this bewitching this influence cometh not of him that calleth you and so we could say they were manifesting some Works they had run well they had made some progress but something is missing and no doubt the Galatians would be able to say well we did this and we did that and these things have happened and these things have transpired and yet Paul is wanting to say he's not want to say well you ain't been nowhere to begin with he's saying you began well you've ran well you started in the spirit but having begun in the spirit you're not going to perfect yourself through fleshly Works you've got to stay connected with that faith and the word of God which birth you because that's what's going to bring out the real fruit of the spirit not the works of the flesh or the works of the law but the real work of God and the man as we mentioned in Matthew 7:22 many will come before the Lord on that day and say have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful Works yet Jesus said these works are associated with iniquity says ye that work iniquity and we could I don't think it would be wrong to think of maybe other things that they were doing that amounted to iniquity but even in all these Works they're doing they missed the mark it wasn't done in the manner that God had desired them to it wasn't meeting the mark of what God wanted so how are these Works iniquity in Galatians 3: 5 to 7 notice how Paul addresses this he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you now this is a great challenge the one that ministers to you the spirit even the one that would Minister the word the word and Spirit uh working together and it says and works miracles among you it's good to ask ourselves doeth he by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith Fai what is it is it is it in the flesh is it in the man is it in the supposed gift what what is it in how does it operate what makes these things Works he says or by the hearing of faith and we know that the question in the sense that it's rhetorical saying it's not by The Works of the law that one would manifest a miracle but it's by the hearing of Faith even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith are the the same are the the children of Abraham so faith is receiving that's what faith is Faith is receiving not working and therefore as the principle of the seed is that Faith working and we are the Seed of Abraham then as Faith Works in US it works its way out it works its way according to the law of the Harvest the law of the seed so faith is at its core receiving and it's not something we work ourselves towards in Romans 10: 16 and 17 but they have not all obeyed the gospel El for as I Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so it says you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth where was the problem they were getting more in the outward elements and the inner court and the outer court and they were more dwelling in these other Realms and not staying connected to the presence of God down on the inside which is to grow your faith by the word and so he said who did hinder you that you did not obey the truth that you did not further obey the truth because having begun in the spirit you're not made perfect by the flesh so it's their own flesh that's hindering them and if they had not obeyed the gospel it's because their faith is not being mixed with the word that they've heard faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God now without getting into much of a lesson on the galatian church we know that they were flirting with going back to the law and they were uh mixing in Traditions and they were elevating the traditions of of men they were elevating the Flesh and in doing so they were forfeiting the Liberty that they had in Christ and it was kind of the the easy things to do the lwh hanging fruit where if I could just do this I'm all right if I could just do that it's all right it's something that I could do um the easy emotionalism or easy believism whatever they could do in the flesh to Plate themselves and so we're wanting to go back to the works of the law and Paul said you're forfeiting your Liberty it comes by hearing the word of God and that energizing your faith and the life lived by that word is what God is looking for Galatians 2: 16 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for by The Works of the law shall no flesh be justified a man is not justified by The Works of the law but he's justified by the faith of Jesus Christ this is Paul's battle with them the the the lusting of the Flesh and the pride of life and those things of drawing them away whether it be in a carnal way or in a a nominal uh religious way he saiding it's by faith in Jesus Christ not the works of the law that's not what justifies us so in verse 10 of chapter 3 in verse 11 for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them so you had to keep it perfectly or it condemns you he says but that no man is Justified by the law and the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith tradition and error were being mixed into the gospel they're trying to bring things from their past experiences things from the law being mixed into the gospel is depriving them of their perfect Liberty and it was this deception by works because he's constantly calling out the works is it the works of the law is it the works of the flesh having begun the spirit are you going to make yourself perfect you're going to work your way to this you're going to work your way to your adoption you're going to work your way to the seal you're going to work your way to this and he's really calling out this human mindset to where they were being deceived by works whether it be emotional or intellectual he's saying you're both you're both in the ditch and you've got to come back to the real heart of the matter back to Faith by the word of God and so it's works that are really at issue here that he's dealing with but yet we know that works are or works is Faith expressed now it can't be works of the flesh or just works of the law but it's got to be the word working in US can't we we don't want to have this attitude well a tree devoid of fruit and a and a life devoid of the of the word of God and a life devoid of works is well it's just Faith by faith I believe and yet nothing's ever happening nothing's ever moving but the Temptation is to try to adopt a certain uh uh Paradigm of what it should look like and works that we should do and then you just make it tradition and then making it traditional and making it an ought to in those things it really robs the leadership of the Holy SP spirit in one's life to allow the word to manifest itself through so just as brother Bram addresses it and works as Faith expressed he says that in James that Abraham was justified by his works the vantage point where Abraham did in Works did in activity did in life manifest Faith through his works but God had already known by his faith in his heart he was justified by his faith and his heart and knew his heart was right so then God asked him to do something in Abraham's perfect faith and Abraham's Works bringing Faith expressed and bringing it to his Perfection was him obeying God and doing exactly what God said he should do without fear fear being cast out and so we have the same challenge in our lives to have Works which is Faith Express but not works just works of the flesh or works of the law Paul says it this way when writing Titus 3: 1 to8 put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey Magistrate to be ready to every good work to speak evil of no man to be no Brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men so he is advocating that there be works that we would be ready to every good work and that we would also likewise not have evil Works a work of the flesh that we would not speak evil we would not be Brawlers but we would be gentle showing all meekness unto all men this is how Christians ought to be for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient received serving diverse lust and Pleasures this is what we were subject to we're subject to the flesh living in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another these fruits should ought not to be so in a believer's life these are things that the Holy Spirit wants to address if they're in our spirit at all he's wanting to uh remove these things and and mellow us out in the flesh but after that the kindness and love of God this is his Mercy the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteous which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us so if works are an issue it's not the works of righteousness that we did but the work of Mercy that saved us what is this work of Mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost we what one time were disobedient deceived serving diverse lust and Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful hating one another but the kindness and love of God the mercy of God came and worked on us and changed us verse 6 which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior what was it that he shed upon us not just his blood but the kindness and love of God his Mercy that being justified by his grace we should be made hes this comes back into that idea of why are we growing up why do we go through trials why are we suffering to receive our inheritance made Hees according to the hope of eternal life this is a faithful saying and these things I will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto men so you do have works of the flesh works of the law versus the fruit of the spirit or the works here where he's saying these good and profitable Works he's to maintain good works to be ready to every good work there is an absolute necessity of a life following the experience that one has with the word that is something that changes you and brother bam even identifies that at the most basic level one of the most remarkable things about A change is your desires change and if your desires change your actions change your Works change your ambition change changes and so there's a change that takes place and there's a way that the Holy Spirit manifest itself in the life of someone now we don't do that to create a we don't just create uh uh of an image and say I just want to strive um to wear this particular clothing or listen to this particular song or do this particular thing but it is a matter of yielding to the Holy Spirit and letting him work through us and then maybe in the best way is that we would have the fruit of the spirit in our lives that we would not uh be Brawlers and speak evil and be foolish and disobedient and deceived and giving into diverse lust and Pleasures but that we too would be enveloped with the kindness and love of God that we would be gentle showing meekness unto all men that we would be ready to every good work so there is a challenge to have the works of God G in our lives but it's the right kind of works now I'm maybe not just not sure if this is going to to you going to seem like it Blends together but this is right where we left off on uh Sunday morning and the sermon is this the sign of the ins sir brother Brand's talking about the different Mysteries that are going to be wrapped up at the end time and he refers to this one in particular The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now this is a statement that put this way he doesn't he doesn't say it this way anywhere else it's the one place where he says it just like this the mystery the baptism ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the works the the same works that he did well that's quite a statement that one of these end time Mysteries that's uh revealed and that these Loose Ends that's tied up is the mystery of the baptism the Holy Ghost without sensation now we can look into the message of the hour up to especially up to this point and find that without sensation is a reference to I believe other teachings of his without physical evidence that one of the sensations he most often called out and he continues to do so after the seals is that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues shouting crying dancing and all those things is not the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on one Soul he says one of the mysteries of this age is that you would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without an without an absolute singular evidence of the Holy Ghost such as speaking in tongues blood coming out of your hands sweating passing out crying all those different things and he addresses it in many different ways so when he says the mystery of the baptism goes without sensation I believe it's important to take into mind everything he taught about the lack of sensation being an Evidence instead of making a doctrine that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when is the baptism the ghost is without any knowledge any sensation without anything at all such if you look back in your life you know what that night that I got the Holy Ghost I wept like a baby H must not have got it because that wouldn't be right you can't you don't want to kind of take the inverse of this and say that the mystery of the Bap ghost is without sensation so that if I had any kind of sensation with it then I didn't get the Holy Ghost oh that I say that would be a perverting and that would be a misuse of this statement do do not believe that's what brother brandom is advocating for is this complete lack of emotion or ation from the Holy Ghost anybody who's been born again can testify uh that or not anybody but most who've been born again can testified that the movement of God in their lives creates some sort of stimulus now I'm glad that he just doesn't leave it at that and say the mystery of the baptism goes without sensation so it's just sterile it's without you know it's just well you just uh do you believe that you have it yeah I believe that I have it okay then you got it don't ever think about it again just move on when did you get it I have no idea well it doesn't matter you just think just believe that you got it and go on but he says but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did that's quite a statement and it's there to add to and to bring a much complet more complete picture of the mystery of the baptism ghost without sensation and the moment that I received the Holy Ghost I didn't have to speak in tongues it didn't have to shout it didn't have to dance it didn't have to cry because the Holy Ghost can move like that in a service and everybody do the same physical manifestation outwardly but that's not the baptism of the holy ghost in One Soul that is a genuine holy ghost moving on the outer court or the inner court but the real genuine seal of God in the soul is not backed up by an Evidence of shouting dancing speaking in tongues and all those different things he's saying that's the mystery of the baptism ghost without an Evidence or a sensation but the evidence is Christ performing his Works according to his word Christ the person in you doing the same works that he did Jesus says in John 14:12 verily verily I say to you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also how do we received the Spirit by faith so the word he that believeth on me has passed already from death into life that by by the new birth with the indwelling the Holy Spirit he that believeth on me the works the baptism of goost says the Seal of your faith The Works that I do shall he do also he says and Greater Works than these shall he do because that go unto my father brother brand in the sermon Shalom he says doing it the way just the way he does it in this end time he's talking about the Shalom this light has come doing it just the way he does it in other words it's not just Lord I did I cast out devils in your name and I spoke in tongues I did many many wonderful works in your says depart from me ye that work iniquity that to do the works that he did the same works that he did is to do it according to the nature and characteristics of Christ not just the letter form you Remember The False Image on of Proverbs that uh spare the rod spoil the child is how we might summarize it beat him with the rod drop the devil out of them and so we think oh well then the image of the word is a a crying baby having just been freshly spanked say well I don't know that that doesn't really tell the full picture because the word is wanting to bring the Peaceable fruits of righteousness after the fact and correct behavior and fear of God and a love for his word so for just producing spanked babies it's a False Image say well the words being fulfilled well the word's being fulfilled just like brother bandam said when you try those people why the word and the word test what is their response well we get results don't we got a room full of spanking cried babies it's like well but what does it produce like it it produce a lot of crying babies no what is that spanking supposed to produce what is that move of God in people's heart supposed to produce what are the use of the offerings and sacrifices is to bring someone in ultimately to the most holy place to the to the to that Ark of mercy and truth brother brandom in the sermon the lamb and the dove it was believe it was brother wendle martin that shared this recently uh to a group of brothers that I'm in fellowship with he said you say brother brandom what is the way back to the oldfashioned meetings just become Lambs again that's all just get back to being sheep the dove hasn't gone very far he's just waiting a chance to get back there's the road back to isua Street there's the place back I mean just think about this image back to the isua street meetings again yeah woo right and he says look at what he says is to return to a lamb nature again man all of a sudden it's more Meek it's more LED it's more mild you think yeah we need to go back to isus the street again well to go back to that and how the power of God manifested in those services and how the move of God and the supernatural that was done and the things that they overcame and he says it's not because they worked themselves into it and they worked themselves into a frenzy but it was to return to a lamb nature again it's not in the physical it's not in the emotional it's not in the intellectual it's back to the nature of the Lamb again that's what the dove can lead is the nature of the Lamb you want to go back even this is Brother Bram correc in the attitude of P Pentecostalism that had become such a robust machine and had well oiled and worked in these certain ways and these certain Dynamics or these certain mechanics and he said you really want to have the power of God move again he had to correct the leot to seeing age and call him back to Pentecost because they'd completely perverted the meaning of Pentecost even when it came to tongues and those things he said when you speak in tongues and it's not interpreted he said that's back to vomit again that's back to Pentecost he said that's back to Babylon and so a real isua Street meeting is just to re be be a lamb again John chapter 6: 28 and 29 then said they unto him of course the context of this is very rich he' multiplied the bread and they're like whoa wow that's amazing so they wanted to find follow him and he said you are you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you want the bread it's your gut that wants it not your heart it's the flesh it's what it's what I do to the body and the mind in your in your spirit not your heart that's really moved and even when he rebukes them this is their response they said un him what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said to them this is the work of God now I'm sharing these things let me say it this way I'm sharing these things to so that you can see that the works of the Holy Spirit are the same works that Christ did and so then it it we we're we should be challenged then because if we're say all right it's the works that Christ did okay so then and we get our bucket list walk on water turn water into wine right heal a leper like where are we going to get a leper and and there's all these things that we start trying to do and we think we're just going to walk down the list but it's getting to the heart of what did Jesus do what was the mark it was that Dynamic of that relationship between a father and son let me just put that in there because I think that was at the core of Jesus did only that which the father told him the harmony between the father and the son is the harmony that now exists between Christ and his bride that's the real work the works that I do shall you do also it's being obedient to the father's will yes that's what that that was at the heart of it he says so what can we do to work the works of God well this is the work of God that you believe on him whom you have sent that goes right back to what Paul is saying Paul was saying when you were sealed it was but a seal of your faith so don't ever leave that channel of hearing the word of God and doing what he says hearing the word of God and doing what he says that's what is the the gold in this is that sons of God and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God and being led in the spirit he said if you'll walk in the spirit you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh if you walk in the spirit you'll bring forth the fruit of the spirit it's a law of the seed that the germ of life that's been quickened to uh by the spirit of God down in your soul if you can feed that experience you'll grow up into him as Paul travailed till Christ be formed in you Christ will be formed in you as you yield to the Holy Spirit feed on the word of God and have an attitude that you desire to change and yield to him so it's that the work of God is to believe on him whom he hath sent this is is that Father and Son relationship as God said to so David about Solomon I will be a father to him and he will be my son if he do if he does wrong I'll correct him but I'll have mercy on him and I I I'll grow him I'll cultivate him I'll watch out over him the works there is a work of the Holy Ghost in our lives and brother B say it's not emotion he say it's not sensation yet sensation with it and you could look at maybe some of these works of the law and you'd find well it's not that the law was all of a sudden evil and it was all of a sudden that you you had to go anti law that's not it it's just you can't you can't be Bewitched and deceived into these other things as a means of righteousness righteousness is by faith faith that comes by hearing the word of God and so when we ask the question and I think this is just the first of maybe many series on this or services on this subject is there room for Mercy do we have do we have place in our hearts for not just truth and maybe a rigid discipline to a construct or the the legalist way when we can approach the word but do we also have room for the mercy that's necessary for this to come to pass a real understanding and we could say it in this way as as the picture just built in my heart Sunday morning we spend a lot more time on this in the correction of a child and and the response of a father to the child and those different things and we were looking even at how brother brandham was saying you know the act of turning loose and he says not an emotion but that unadultered faith faith that God would receive and then nurture you to be an eagle and then learning how to fly and that there was just um a lot that we were focusing on that comes from the standpoint of God knowing you as a father God understanding you and knowing the right way to approach you to where it's not just legalism and it's and it's not just uh lasciviousness but it's God working within you to bring you to a place of perfection and it requires Mercy you see is there room for Mercy I'm wanting to draw from the image of a house that as we might have somebody named charity and someone named Faith or hope and maybe there's someone named mercy and is Mercy needs a place needs a room in this house and then brother bradam has asked this question and that wonderful sum of 64 August 30th in the morning this is question 328 he's asked this question dear brother brandom is it possible for one to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not have signs following at least not until some future time in conditions appointed by the spirit I encourage you to go listen to this particular portion or read it uh in whatever means that you use and whatever app or maybe old oldfashioned books I just really encourage you to read or listen to this brother brandom is it possible for one to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not have signs following you can say that's the question the qualifier at war or at least not until some future time and conditions appointed by the spirit so a season of time where maybe you don't have signs following until maybe later until a future time and condition that the Holy Spirit has ordained and brother BR when he begins to answer this it's really beautiful the way he begins to start to answer this but brother bam says it gave him an opportunity to address his family it's the way he begin this answer he says I like this it gives me an opportunity to address my family my converts my followers but he makes this reference to family and he says I want to he makes this point that he wants to clarify his position on what it means to be Pentecostal and denominational systems he says people say whe they're Pentecostal or Pentecostal in these denominational systems and so he's said I love this opportunity I've been asked this question is it possible for someone to have the baptism of ghost without these signs and wonders following them at least at not till some future time he says thank you for asking the question I can use this as an opportunity to address my family to address my converts remember Sunday we focused on how Paul as a father to those in the gospel Galatians was that fatherly approach using that truth and mercy and at the end of this answer when he's at the very end of answer in it it's several paragraphs long he points out that a person's nature may push them toward a certain condition now notice how I I want you to pick up on this part as I'm trying to summarize it brother BR said is asked is it possible for someone to have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost I say that in other words it's not just the spirit being poured out but that can they have the Holy Ghost IND dwelling but not have signs following and they might have in their mind a certain subset of signs that's really important to them and he and he said this is great I can address my family on on what it means to be Pentecostal and all these denominational systems and how they've organized around evidences and they put a period on different things and he ends up saying you know a person's nature May force them or put P them towards a certain condition they have the Holy Ghost and they want something a certain way they just got to have it and he quotes someone saying I want to be sure I have the Holy Ghost father just give me this for something to stand on and this this could be anything let's just say Lord just give me the tongues just give me the shout just give me the cry give me the dance uh so I can have something to stand on what is that it's a person's nature pushing them toward a certain condition and he says now if I taught it like that that people would reach out and get a hold of that without having what that person's got did you catch that so if someone says oh I just need to dance I just need to shout I just need to cry I just need to pass out I just need to speak in tongues and that person who has the Holy Ghost is just looking for something to stand on and the father says well you know what I'll give it to him I'll confirm it for him I'll I'll do this for him and God does that for them and then brother abam says begins to preach that you want the Holy Ghost you need to do this you need to do that he says then people reach out and get a hold of that in other words do it but not have what that person had that's that's powerful so he says this the Holy Spirit can fall in a group of people and speak in tongues and make it exactly true sprawl in amongst the people and make it prophesy and be exactly true that's right that's exactly right sometimes you can go to a witch or a medium and they can tell you something that's exactly right look at the witch of indor Saul it could be exactly true that's still isn't it they're witches speaking in tongues I've seen Devils speak in tongues and write in unknown languages that don't mean anything but the real thing is that word again back to that word Paul's message to the Galatians parallels this message back to the word that he he's not taking anything away from him he's not uh trying to tear down their experience but he's saying you got to be careful that you don't adopt a paradigm around the outer court and the inner court and that you dwell in that most holy place these things are necessary these things happen we can visit these places but this is where God dwells this is where his word is it's from there that he wants to work out and so brother mam this is him addressing this question he says this person this is very lengthy but we'll end on this this person here is asking the question about the possibility of having the baptism ghost without signs following them now I'm answering this in a real juvenile my way of doing it but if you're born a normal human being you will actually do the things that a normal human being would do is that right when you're born as a human the natural traits of Human begin being a human being will follow you you won't live in a tree and try to fly with your wings like a bird or something like that that wouldn't be a normal human being the normal actions of a human being the normal action of a human being would be would be to work work marry have a family and do these things just reminds me brother John of sister Esther's wedding speech that have grandchildren have children that was what she wanted to tell sister Sarah is have kids as soon as possible that's the real beauty of family so the normal action of human being is to work marry have family and do these things that's natural normal human beings because you're born that then when you're born a Christian born of the spirit of God you naturally take up the attributes of Christ says now if we took care this morning in this congregation where you people set here and listen day after day and so forth to the teaching you'll find out you'd be different one from another just zero in on this because he's saying that if you are born of the word of God or born a Christian born by the spirit of God you'll take up the attributes of Christ now we're still human so there's certain human elements that'll exist but you'll take up attributes of Christ but those that sit under the teach of the word of God you'll find out they're different one from another because you are different your makeup different your appetites are different you eat different but you all eat food right we may all not eat at Ros but we all eat food with one individual being just like the other one you're different one from another Christians do the same thing you can't say now all do all speak with tongues do all prophesy do all see how you make something a law you make something an not to well this is the way that it has to work out this is the way it has to be he said no cuz a person says is it possible that you could have the bapt of the Holy Ghost and and not have signs following and brother Bram as a father addressing his family saying you know what we're all different we're all nature different but we all eat food so when it comes to the attributes of Christ what is common what's the common you brother Brown even says you may not we we all may not be lay our hands on somebody and feel the charge of the Holy Ghost and life come back into a dead body we may not all do this we may not all do that and so there's things that we're not all going to do but it's being done in the body right because it's according to the word of God it's done in the body but we don't impose all that on there and say okay well you know we're just kind of going through the list of attributes here and I just hadn't seen you lay hands on a sick and they recover uh could you show could you verify a miracle so that we could be sure we're checking that box for you I we can't do that remember how that when we were looking at uh the the ought to in the Great Commission it's amazing how there's certain things that we ought to do but but when it comes to taking up deadly serpents and drinking deadly things you know nobody's passing the cup or the box of snakes right but they want you to speak in tongues they want you to lay hands on the sick and so there's a way that we kind of force this Paradigm that's not in n in the nature of the word he said you just naturally take up attributes of Christ but Christians are different you say well don't all do this or don't all do that he says you have to watch these things because a Christian takes up the habits of a Christian and they live like a Christian Jesus said these signs shall fall them that believe notice in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall take up serpents and drink deadly things they they speak with new tongues in them things just actually follow Christians amen now the person has a very good thing here or do we wait until the future time or the conditions appointed by the Holy Spirit I like that now you get the idea when it's appointed by the Holy Spirit God appoints things I think that if the Pentecostal people would try you'll understand me if we you'll get here why I different with you pressing that idea that they must all speak with tongues I cannot see that right I like cherry pie and I'm a human being but there's no need of me trying to tell you if you don't eat cherry pie you're not a human being right but eating cherry pie is just one of the habits of a human being you might disagree with me on that but it's true now one will eat this and one will do something else yeah I think you just have to really catch what he's trying to say in answering this question in a very delicate way is right his answer doesn't nah you don't you don't need to worry about anything no signs you could just come as you are remain as you are just believe that you got the Holy Ghost he says but the Holy Spirit appoints these offices but when you try to force yourself into it now that's not fair to you you try to force yourself into doing something a certain way and I'll just I'll just address uh uh address address Ros for a second somebody saying well brother Aaron you mentioned it so much I've been there I didn't like it okay well you don't have to force you don't have to force yourself on it just buy me one right you know save a room at the table for me but no it's not this expectation like what do you mean you don't like that what do you mean you don't like that hey everybody's different everybody's different some people don't like this some people don't like that some people can agree on things but we're all eating and so these differences that we all have he's saying don't force that on yourself that's number one don't force this Paradigm on yourself I got to be this way I got to be that way or I don't have it he says no that's no different than saying well just because you don't eat rles you're not a human being right when you try to force yourself into it then he says if I said you had to eat cherry pie would if cherry pie made you vomit and yet you'd vomit and try to eat cherry pie and vomit because you're trying to force yourself into it and they say this is good this is what I have to do this is what I have to do says you're hurting yourself and that's the way you try to do when you try to force yourself to do something that's contrary to the spirit now what's contrary to the spirit would it be contrary to the spirit with speak to speak with tongues would it be contrary to the spirit to to lay hands on the sick no but to Force One into a paradigm that this is what you ought to do this is what you have to do force yourself he says he's got your life lotted for a certain thing do you understand that amen this is the mercy this is the mercy where he knows our frame he knows that we're dust he knows where we come from God knows your temperament God knows how you are remember how brother B said you know if one's a little H uh uh emotional then they're going to tend this way if one's a little starchy they're going to tend that way and he says if the way one is when they come you got to watch them if they're not careful they'll gravitate to these other sides he says you got to watch these things you got to watch these little ideas and these different makeups and things because a Christian has to take up the attributes of Christ and the habits of Christ not the habits of human beings you can't force yourself into particular things says do you understand that says and you when you're filled with the spirit here's one of the best signs I know you're so in love with Christ and believe every word that he says to be truth well that's that sounds about a pretty good evidence of a Christian now that's some food I think we could all eat we love Christ and we believe every word that he says to be the truth that's the evidence that you have the Holy Spirit in your life's full of joy oh my everything's different than what it used to be that's the Holy Spirit now these gifts are in the spirit notice I I I like this he says if every person in here was in perfectly harmony with the Holy Spirit every one of you was filled with the Holy Ghost and in harmony with the Holy Ghost these signs would just be multiplying among you all the time it'd just be constantly going but where there's confusion where there's difference where we set up the Holy Spirit can't move itself it can't operate through the people so you can't can't take away that aspect of the Holy Spirit he says and if I said now you each one of you did you speak in tongues yeah well you got it did you speak in tongu no you haven't got it now I'm making myself a judge God is the judge of these things but watch Jesus said these signs shall follow them the groups that believe the whole nature of the Holy Spirit flows through them and they are full of love and joy and just a great bundle of real goodly Godly filled people that's the Holy Spirit and in there they speak with tongues on the occasion that the tongues arise why or necess for that they speak with tongues and if there's a prophecy it speaks and oh it's just exactly perfect every time it's really telling us yes as the Holy Spirit appoints it as it is necessary God will do it now if the whole church would work in harmony like that then Among Us would be casting out devils and taking up serpents drinking deadly things all kinds of things going on and now listen but when you try to force that to individuals then you get yourself that's Pentecostal again then you get Babylon confusion notice what it is it's to force it says when you go to force it so it's one thing for you to force it on yourself that's not fair to you but when you go to force that on other people that's Pentecostal again the Babylonian confusion he says you can't judge that our hearts are full of joy and happiness and oh my the birds are singing everything's wonderful just full the spirit of God and we're so in love with Jesus we want to pray all night and he says now I wouldn't embarrass this crowd or even myself to you there's the mercy he says but I wonder if I could ask this morning which one in this crowd or this people that had the Holy Ghost it'd probably be 95% of you raise your hand that you had the Holy Ghost then I'll turn around and give you a Bible evidence just one a Bible evidence and I doubt whether there be one or two hands go up just could tie it in such a place but when you do he said tie in such a place I he saying I could ask how many here has the Holy Ghost everybody 95% of people raise their hand and he says okay this is what the Bible says the evidence of the Holy Ghost so this is what the Bible said someone with the Holy Ghost would do and he said I doubt one or two hands would go up he says you're just tying it to a place he said but when you do that you're also Hur in your congregation how when you force it on individuals when you force it it's not saying that we can't have a um it's not saying that it shouldn't be but it's the nature and the way that it's imposed either to say as we said before well it doesn't matter just let them be kids and let them do this let them do that it doesn't matter this is the way that it this is the way that it can be just let it be or you become legalistic about it oh it needs to be this way it needs to be this way there's no mercy there's no mercy as brother Bram is demonstrating here as a father to his family everybody's different there's the mercy to I know your frame I know your proclivities I know how you're natured I know what you're prone to and every 's different just be yielded he says you could tie it to such a place where if I could put this where where none of you would have it tie it to such a place where we would could not say that we have the Holy Ghost but you're hurting your congregation and then he says this this to me is the Clincher but you've got to get them out of that babyhood and get them into manhood so what was he showing us that there's a there's a particular approach that you've got to take and it's it's not legalism it's not license but it's this you've got to get them out of babyhood you got to get the young to grow up and in order to do that it's got to be the nature of the word that operates within the individual to bring them into the image of Christ amen we've got to go from babyhood into manhood it's going to take the truth it's going to take mercy God bless you tonight let's stand together let's pray if the musicians would come thank you for your attentiveness this evening it is such a privilege to be able to minister here and to serve the Lord together with you let's remember our festival de aono this Saturday from 4 to 8 and be praying for all those that are participating if there's any way that you desire to help or just check the signup sheet maybe in the fellowship hall for more let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight as we close this service and will soon be dismissed I desire Lord as the one who who has ministered and delivered a burden tonight I desire that The Words which we spoke though perhaps hurried and maybe there was a lot a lot of scripture and different kind of angle there towards the end I just hope that you could deal with each person's heart Lord even as brother brandham in the sermon works his faith expressed he even spoke when he was praying at the beginning how that would the Holy Spirit just correct what he said in a person's heart and so Lord tonight I just pray that the Holy Spirit would just properly place the things that I said tonight in a person's heart Lord if I said it in a way towards just angled a little bit differently to where it just it doesn't find that that nest in that spot just right May the Holy Spirit just turn it around in that person's heart so that this word which we have shared tonight could be added to a person's faith and Lord for me as I preach these things I just feel like I'm in the middle of a thought as I end each one of these services but Lord I just desire that there would be more Mercy that there be more room for mercy in my heart that can have I could have your eyes that I might be your hands Lord if I'm going to be your eyes have the right kind of eyes to be the right kind of hands Lord then I want to have the right kind of ear to hear your word because Lord you put an ear in my heart to hear and I want that word to work freely in my life so father I ask tonight is there room for mercy in our hearts brother bandam says we could judge and we could just try to clinch things down so tight where none of us would have it but Lord let us get out of this judging let us get out of this lacad isical let may we not lack truth and not lack Mercy but Lord may we grow out of babyhood into manhood so Lord I pray for us tonight as a church as families as individuals that we could learn from these things and be corrected by these things so we ask for your mercy in our lives just take your take your time with us Lord use us For Your Glory wash us Purge us instruct us lead us and guide us may we feel a new feeling a freshness father we commit all things to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
