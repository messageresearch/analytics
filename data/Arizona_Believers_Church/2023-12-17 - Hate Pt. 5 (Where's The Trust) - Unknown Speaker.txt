TRANSCRIPT
========================================
going to continue on the subject of hate and the question I'm asking today is our title is where's the trust there'll be a lot of similarities with the subject matter on Wednesday night on where's the confidence and I I think those two uh words could be used interchangeably as a matter of fact in the Old Testament sometimes it's translated to trust sometimes confidence but I wanted to take it from a little bit of a different uh just a little bit further angle today so this is a question we're posing is where's the Trust on this subject of hate been using different definitions to uh kind of work out what we're meaning when we talk about hate uh something that's kind of settled in my heart in terms of expressing it a particular way is it's when someone or something becomes an enemy we've been saying an intense negative emotional response to someone or something but it's kind of good to think it in terms of not just saying you don't like a vegetable or you hate something uh you know I hate to be long- winded this morning and that's kind of just a term that we use and we say it but we're not really uh detesting in it it's not real a real visceral reaction but when we're talking about hate it's very specific and The more I've studied it the more I've come to realize that this this type of hate is very rare and that sometimes we just use the phrase and we use it so often a lot of times it's kind of thrown out there though that's hate and this is hate and it happens so often that we really miss the true uh depth of just how evil hate is I believe it was Aristotle that defined it in the sense that it's an emot or a feeling or a desire that uh something or someone would cease to exist and you don't care how that happens and and so that's a very intense strong desire to where you would want it to uh cease to exist rather than just merely suffer and so that's a it's a real strong emotion and I realize that that when we talk about hate we might experience feelings and we might attribute it to hate and The more I've studied this the more I've realized that hate um is a very rare thing at its core in terms of really hating something if you asked me do you hate this or do you hate that uh and I said could ask maybe today do any of you hate anyone some of you might find it very very hard to think of anyone that you actually truly hate that you'd want them to cease to exist and we're not just talking about the starting quarterback on the fantasy team that you're facing this weekend where you wouldn't want them to play or be inactive we're talking about real true genuine I don't want them just to suffer I want them to cease to exist and it doesn't matter to me how that happens you'd find that hate maybe is very rare and you might feel like you've never actually truly hated your whole life but yet today I want to touch on some things in a way to realize that there's a way that the devil's trying to synthesize that there's a way the world tries to provoke that and use these emotions and it still has this effect this costic of impacting Us in very deep ways and we've seen that already uh in the scripture and it's important for us to take these things in mind uh through these first uh four or five Services we've looked at it from or four Services we looked looked at it in terms of hate being the opposite of or the enemy of love and peace and strength and confidence and that where those things are and they exist uh they're a buffer against hate and they keep hate in check and they keep it away and they drive away its negative effects but where uh these things no longer exist or where hate drives them away uh or they lose preeminence we find ourselves subject to emotions and we can find ourselves subject to hate when you stop loving you you're subject to hate when hate enters in peace leaves and often times we're hating because we're not confident and we don't have that kind of strength picking us up we could put it in terms of kind of being in the flesh where we get get angry and we get certain emotions start uh thriving and then we get hateful or being in the spirit where we we're channeling our energy we have our uh emotions subject to the word of God something I've learned in terms of uh emotions is that we're subject to them we're emotional beings we're emot creatures and there's going to be frustration and there's going to be disappointment and so it's not sinful to be disappointed but it would be sinful to allow your disappointment to have preeminence it's maybe not sinful to experience certain emotions uh but yet when those have the preeminence in you're Guided by them that's when we're led into air and so we want the Holy Spirit to have preeminence in all things now if you look at James chapter 5 verse 9 this will pick up on a lot of the things we're speaking about Wednesday night and as we go forward recognized I think we dealt with the origin of hate uh in the beginning how it's attributed to Satan we see it manifested in Cain and we're we've understood the nature of hate how it's corrosive it's a cancer it weakens us it deprives us of strength and life and we're looking at more and more how hate starts and why it begins to start and then also how to overcome it and I think you'll see those themes in these things today and so we're asking where's the Trust In James 5:9 it says Grudge not against another Brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door to Grudge is to find fault with it's to uh not only to find fault with but on the basis of that fault or offense or disagreement you wish to deprive them or you're of something or you're angry at them and so in James when he's writing this The Grudge comes from kind of a reasonable position you've been defrauded you've been taken advantage of you've been manipulated you wor and you didn't get paid and so he makes reference in these first several verses of bad things happening to an individual that would cause you to wish ill or harm or be angry at another and he says don't Grudge don't maintain these feelings of anger and bitterness and resentment towards someone for something done and I think it would make sense if someone says well whatever you do don't hate that person you're like I don't know him never met them they've never done anything to me that would kind of be an easy ask but it's when the man who who owned the field who promised you $1,000 if you if you harvested the crops in that field and you did it you delivered everything and you did your job in the end he says well you can go ahead and keep a couple ears of corn uh for your work and you don't get paid he's saying don't be angry don't be resentful don't be grudging to Grudge in the Bible in the Old Testament it's to keep in mind and keep in memory an offense that's been done with the desire that you would seek revenge or that you would return the deed and the Very word kind of has this meaning to retain hatred that if you Grudge you're holding your hatred if you Grudge you're putting it in a safe place and you're going to keep it there until a time when you could really use it and so there's a lot that's referenced in this to say whatever you do don't retain hatred don't Grudge don't be angry or resentful and the resentment and bitterness and grudging as the Bible refers to it here we can even say envy and jealousy these are all precursors of hate to where if you begin to hold some of these they can work their way into that intense negative emotional response to where now it's not that you want to return the deed but you just wish they would cease to exist and you don't care how that happens and it all starts with some of these feelings or you could have hate and it manifests itself in resentment and bitterness and jealousy and envy he says Grudge not lest you be condemned that condemnation comes because hate causes damage hate is something that will uh cause uh hold uh will impair our judgment it'll it drain us of of of positive uh thoughts and and good emotions and so it's a cancer is how we referred to it so holding on to resentment and holding on to bitterness is painful it's harmful and sometimes we think we're hurting because of what's been done to us but actually what's hurting is the hate you're holding on to because of what's been done and say man I'm miserable and and I can't this happened and that happened it's because this happened because that happens more because you're you're not letting it go the more you hold on to offense the more it's kind of hurting you and the more that it's dragging you down and the more that it has power over you that's the beauty of forgiveness when youever you offend uh forgive the offender they they've lost their power over you people who try to victimize you or harm you or hurt you and they do things to tear you down and H and uh to to belittle you the more you hold on to that the more they continue to harm you the more they have power over you but as soon as you can truly forgive them in your heart they've lost all power over you and so by yielding to a spirit of anger by yielding to a spirit of hate you the Bible's saying Grudge not lest you be condemned you come under the condemnation of the wicked in Proverbs chap 26: 211 this will review a little bit from last Sunday I think is coals are to burning coals in wood to fire what is that fuel when you had wood toile that uh to fire that's a a source to consume to build energy so is a contentious man to to Kindle Strife hate is a fuel it incites Wicked passions it kind of encourages us to evil thoughts it motivates uh these carnal actions uh uh overt actions that relate to hate or bitterness or resent being resentful where if you're jealous of somebody and they say and they express something to you say well do I'm thinking about buying this uh this tie and if a Brother's jealous of that brother he might say oh no that's an ugly tie I wouldn't buy it everyone will think you're goofy and he's like oh thanks for looking out for me and then you buy it guys do this all the time right yeah don't wear that fit that's ugly and because you're jealous maybe it's not the guys maybe it's others that do stuff like that but it motivates us to carnal actions this jealousy and uh hatred it's it's a it's a fuel that's why the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 26 and 27 and and I will I was going to say this at the said I didn't didn't write it down or anything to uh Express this I I feel like I can really deliver my burden on this subject today so if you really pull hard and you smile why I preach and you get behind it maybe we could leave the subject of hate behind and go into other themes uh for the remainder of the year but there's just a lot here I feel like I'm going to be able to get out today and I'll be happy to move on from this but Ephesians chapter 4: 26- 27 it says be angry and sin not I'm wanting us to recogniz how the Bible is warning us against these intense negative emotional responses to someone or something be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil so there's something about allowing anger to Fester something about allowing wrath to continue to exist that's going to give place to the devil and he's dealing with uh being provoked to anger where you're agitated and there something something that happens where there's this impulse and this instinct to be angry at something or be mad about something and it's implying to us that there's a difference well let me say this there's a difference between anger and hate and maybe that's a distinction for the philosophers but there is a dis a difference and it's telling us that you can be angry and not sin so there is though anger is not sinful there's a danger in it becoming sin if it's not addressed because it says be angry and sin not and then how is it say well how do I not sin don't give place to the devil don't let the sun go down upon your wrath so it's saying if you don't address the anger if you don't address the cause and it's not something that you're directly addressing then it can lead you to sin because anger can grow into hate once it grows into hate it it inflames vindictiveness and Vengeance and some of those other things that we've looked at so when it says be angry and sin not it allows for anger but it's saying don't allow this emotion to fester and lead you into sin or to miss the Mark or to wander away from righteousness because of that anger so we can say a again anger itself is not sin but it can produce hatred produce malice and bitterness and even revengeful feelings I think one translation rendered it this way or a commenter said he that will be angry and not sin let him be angry at nothing but sin I like that because that projects our what our hatred ought to be to is to evil and and if we love God then we hate sin and if we're going to be angry and not sin then be angry only at sin and when it says let not the sun go down on your wrath resist those irritations uh the mulling over and and turning things up to where it kind of exasperates you a little bit and that feeding that will turn anger into hate Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath because that just continues to fuel and continues to swell up these emotions and it can lead you to a place which is a deeper more resentful feeling neither give place to the devil I like to say it this way neither give place to hate because the devil wants to influence your mind he wants to irritate your spirits we really should look at everything the devil's doing as just a game he he's constantly trolling us right he's just wanting to trigger us he's just wanting us to get mad he's he's just trying to stir you up and by any means necessary doesn't really matter to him necessarily what you do and what's happening if he could just stir you up if he could just get you agitated and a lot of times we we look at certain things that happen in our lives and we can be very disappointed in ourselves in something that we we have said or done or something said or done to us and if you could just look at it and realize that's that wasn't his endg game that's his tactic to upset you and not be upset and turned aside by it then you kind of diffuse the devil's program from the beginning so he wants to influence us away influence us away from that steadiness that constancy and it's when our faith is disconnected from the word that we're provoked to act on these emotions and the things of the flesh now in Proverbs chapter 8 verse 13 I think we've reviewed there'll still be a little bit from psalms 27 but I think there a lot of kind of new things in there but hopefully a lot of review so that are kind of all standing in the same spot to take steps together forward hate if I could Define it this way it's that extreme hostility and it stems from something it can stem from harm it stems from uh uh anger as we just addressed but then it also comes from fear and this is something I want to us to look at this lack of trust in Proverbs 88:13 the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy in the evil way and the forward mouth do I hate one of the often missed instigators to hate is fear and here it says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil this fear that's spoken of is this respect and reverence to God it's kind of and this respect and reverence of God as it's used here the fear of the Lord I'm in awe of God I reverence God I have this respect for God and that fear or reverence is demonstrated in a trust it's demonstrated in a confidence in God and this kind of fear that's spoken of here is a different fear from this worldly fear of dread or to be terrified when it says to fear the lord to fear the lord is to hate evil there is emotions of fear that are not like that fear as Adam in the garden said I heard your voice and I was afraid God's not like good it was the wrong kind of fear it's when God God appeared to Abraham he said fear not Abram so there's these disconcerting emotions of fear that are not good and it's impossible to hate evil truly hate evil without first loving good because fearing God leads to hating evil fearing God and reverencing God will lead when you have that kind of fear it leads to the right kind of hate where I hate every false way the more I fear your word the more I fear displeasing you the more I fear you God the more I hate evil so there's this counterpart to where fear this right kind of reverence is producing the right kind of hate now if we just invert that the wrong to fear this ter Terror or dread leads to an evil hate because we'll hate the thing that we're afraid of we'll hate what we don't trust when you dread something when God appeared to Abram he says fear not Abram I don't want you to be uneasy around me I don't want you to fear me because we will eventually I think it's even Shakespeare that writes it he says in time H uh in time I think it's the the the assistant to Cleopatra and and is it Cleopatra and Anthony I can't remember what it is where it says Hey in time you end up hating the thing you fear and when you're afraid of something you're afraid the way someone's going to act you're afraid of what someone's going to say you're afraid of how someone's going to be around you eventually you don't look forward to it and it leads to these intense feelings of I don't even want them to be around I hate this I hate that I I detest it I don't want to be around it and so God is immediately addressing that with Abram saying fear not Abram because the more you dread the quicker the more it'll lead you into a place of wanting something to cease to exist so the Bible as we've read already it says Grudge not one against another behold the judge standeth before the door it's wanting to turn our trust around that if we have the wrong kind of fear and we have the these other feelings and emotions that are leading us to this dark place or this bad place in our mind and our emotions and whether it be Melancholy or depression or just anxiety and fear and for boing or whatever these feelings emotional feelings might be there's a lot of applications in other areas he's saying don't Grudge the judges here so taking you away from The Grudge and the grudging he's telling behold the judge standeth at the door and that's not to remind us that there's a price to pay and he's going to punish you if you Grudge it's to remind us that there's one watching there's one you can trust and this was our emphasis Wednesday night is that there where's our confidence when bad things happen to us where is our confidence when we get all angry and agitated and we want to be vengeful and we want to even the score where's our confidence that God said I'll take care of it I'm watching out even over this to make sure that it works together for your good in my glory so there's a certain rest that we have in knowing that the judge is at the door there's one watching there's one that knows that we can trust and so it's the fear of the one who's at the door that is what we should trust in this is what David brings us to in Psalms 27 we'll read verses 1 to3 the Lord is my light and my salvation because of that Whom Shall I Fear no one nothing the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid he's identifying these emotions of fear and being afraid and saying why should I fear in light of him why should I allow myself to be distressed and and uh vanquished and drained of life and and forboding and always on edge and nervous and anxious of things when he's here and I mean and he takes it to be very descriptive because you're thinking yeah I mean if you're there in a palace and you know you're being taken care of and everyone's just waiting on you and whatever you want giving you what you need that's great but then he says when the wicked even my enemies my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell this is this is a strength and a comfort that he has not just when you're hiding behind the walls in a palace and you're the king and there's armies that will defend you but he's saying it's even in times when the enemy has compassed me and has the advantage on me but God who looked out over me he stopped their plans says no h should encamp against me my heart shall not fear so it's not a rest and an ease that you have because the situation is obviously Peaceable but he said even when those that hate me are very near me and a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should Rise Against Me hatred comes to my doorstep offenses and injuries are buffering in me constantly in this will I be confident what what are you confident in this will I feel safe in this will I feel secure in this will I be bold that the Lord is my light the Lord is my salvation I'll say it this way when we're not confident in the right thing it leads to the wrong kind of hate when we're confident in the right thing we hate evil when we're trus in the right thing we hate every Wicked way but when we're not trusting in the right thing it leads to the wrong kind of hate when David says now my head will be lifted up above my enemies it's saying that we ought to as David was able to live above the Warfare live above the host that's encamped itself against you hatred found itself at his doorstep and he didn't stoop to its level he said he set me up upon a rock to where we've got to learn to live above the Hate by trusting in the Lord amen not trusting in the flesh not trusting in our schemes and our conniving to where we could figure out a way to even the score and defend ourselves and get ahead of the story and get our claim out there telling us the Bible tell us don't trust in the flesh don't trust in yourself don't trust in your own schemes because when you're doing that you know deep down inside that you're no match for this on your own and so it doesn't produce feelings of fear the only way or comfort and Faith it only produces fear and the only way it doesn't produce fear is if you're absolutely deceived and that's just going to lead to failure the Bible says in Hebrews 13:5 let your conversation your life be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for Heath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee wanting to use this scripture to point to the judge standeth at the door and how David said the Lord is my light and my salvation the Lord is the strength of my life and he's and he's saying though War rise against me though host encamp itself about me I'm confident here Paul instructing the Hebrews let your conversation be without covetousness and he's talking about the love of money that's what the word there refers to and This Love of Money leads to that average that greediness and that greediness leads to this lack of Happiness as he says be content if you love money if you love if you value possessions if you value Prestige or popularity or clout it leads to be greedy for these things that give some sort of status and he says it'll lack it'll lead you to a place where there's a lack of happiness and ultimately to a place of covetousness in the sense of jealousy because you love money you'll be jealous of those that have money because you want a certain status you're going to be envious and jealous of those who have the very thing that you want and so there's this Instinct of comparing when you love something who has what you love who has the thing you desire and there's always this comparison there some there's this uh Instinct inside of us I I think I'm dealing very deeply with a lot of uh Humanity in the subject matter to where you you could be given something and it might repeat itself time and time again as families start to celebrate Christmas so the last two weeks and you open gifts and you open a gift and you're like wow thank you this is awesome and you're genuinely happy until your brother opens his gift it's like what you got him that and this is all I got I hate this hey and just the second before everything was cool and everything was great you're the best mom thank you so much this is exactly what I wanted this is the best Christmas ever I don't even need to open another gift wait what because it's just something in our heart sometimes that we're happy with what we have until we see what somebody else has all right so think about that while you're buying it certainly is a trap CU you got such a disparity in ages sometimes like well we're buying him a car we probably should buy Jack a car right I mean we don't want him to be jealous I just gave it away I bought I bought Elliot of Tesla I tried to buy it from Micah but he all the things I've said about electric vehicles haven't been registered so we'll keep trying but this covetousness resolves itself to say be content with what you have and then notice what the basis for not fearing the protection from this jealousy or or hate the the protection from covetousness and kind of the secret to contentment is his presence he doesn't just say well don't be Petty don't be jealous don't always be trivializing being upset and trifling about this and he's not just telling us and then kind of moving on and we're kind of like okay I guess I'm just not going to be jealous he's saying don't be jealous I'm with you I've got this I'll never leave you nor forsake you and listen that's not just a you should just be happy I'm here kind of thing he's saying I got this I'm with you I'm for you I'll take care of you I know what you need he's not just saying you know yeah you're broke but at least be happy you're not alone he say I'm The Giver here I'm the provider I'm the one that knows what you really need so it's not empty but his presence is so so full of so much promise like think of the wealth that you have in my presence think of the provision you have in my presence think about the protection and the pleasure that you have in my provision it it it's preeminent over all other things so the reason why we shouldn't covet the reason why we shouldn't fear is David is telling us is his presence The Secret of his presence he'll hide me as the psalmist says in Psalm 563 what time I am afraid I will trust in thee when I'm afraid when I'm feeling this when I experience these emotions and I'm unsettled and I'm nervous and I'm worried and I'm anxious about the future whatever it might be if it's a decision if it's a diagnosis it's if a change of the year if it's a bonus or layoffs are coming whatever it might be in your life and whatever struggle you might be going through at what time I am am afraid this ought to be an instinct within us as Believers when I feel that emotion of fear I want to trust the Lord and what time I am afraid I will feel safe and secure in him amen isn't is that beautiful it's not even telling us at what time you're afraid you don't have the Lord at what time you're afraid the Lord's left you at what time you're afraid you better find God it says in it's that's when he pays off I think we were talking about in this series in perfect love it's it says perfect love cast out fear it doesn't mean that if you have fear you don't have perfect love it's that that's when perfect love pays off it just means your your faith hasn't been made perfect Your Love hasn't been made perfect it just means I'm still here doing what I'm supposed to do and until you come to this place of a perfect peace when I'm afraid I'll trust in thee and if we can be led away from trust in the Lord into fear fear of anything than hatreds nearby at what time I am afraid if there's an object of your fear if you don't trust in the Lord then in time they say time can deal with anger but not so with hate if you if you still hold this fear you'll end up hating the thing you're afraid of that fear that dread that Terror it breeds hatred it breeds hostility why do people have a fear of snakes or why do people hate snakes because they're fear of snakes right there's something you hate you know why do you hate that like I don't know just thought I'd hate it so why do you hate that well it bit me or I've been told they hurt or it'll kill me and so people hate things that they've had a negative experience with or that they that they are afraid of that's why we have this fear is because there's some sort of threat or some perceived threat I was thinking about it this past week you know really nobody really hates the underdog right why nobody's afraid of them I mean why don't you hate the team that's 0 and 14 why is nobody afraid of the Wombats and their fantasy league they're the underdog right nothing's going to happen but when there's somebody that's good or a Powerhouse or blue blood or whatever the terminology is use as opposed to an underdog the favorite people will hate the favorite why do you hate them they're the favorite why do you hate them they're undefeated and there's hate when there's a perceived threat that they can beat you that they can turn your season around or they could beat you up but the the little guy the underdog he's lovable right they go you're just so cute how can anybody hate you we love the underdog because there's no threat we're not subject to loss we're not afraid of them so I wanting you to think in very realistic terms of why we hate because there's a perceived threat or fear when David said in this will I be confident he said in this will I trust this is the image I was hoping to leave you with on Wednesday night it's where I want to come now as we kind of turn the corner a little bit in this will I trust I'm going to look beyond the offense I'm going to look beyond the offender and I'm going to see the judge I'm going to look beyond the host that it's encamped against me I'm going to see him who's with me I'm going to look beyond the pain and the memory and the scars and all these other threats and the Fe fear of the enemy at what time I'm afraid I'm going to look to Christ and I'm going to trust in him I'm acknowledging my fear I'm acknowledging even my insecurities and my vulnerabilities I'm acknowledging my pain I'm acknowledging my hurt but I'm going to trust in you CU if I don't fear the lord then I'll find myself fearing the wrong thing and it leads to hate am now it's the the time is 11:07 I didn't promise any time that I would be done I didn't say I'd be done this morning I didn't even say I'd be done this afternoon but I want to take uh some time to deal with two different aspects and I think this might just be able to close this subject on hate and we can uh we can leave Christmas behind with this subject well actually there's still many days left of envy and jealousy as to what your big brother gets for Christmas think about a Tesla think about that how awesome that would be now if you could focus with me this is I'll say make it as a statement then we'll come to the quote I'm drawing this from people often hate and I'm not saying it's always this way but people often hate because they fear things that are different from them if something's different they can hate it and there's a lot of reasons to that but if it's if there's a uh you when you're the fear of the unknown there's a fear of things that are different but it that fear of things that are different not like you can lead us to hate brother brandom said it we've quoted this already in discernment of spirit he came to bring them peace this is Christ but they misunderstood him and hated him without a cause why did they hate him because they misunderstood him they're afraid of of what he was teaching they're afraid of what he was doing they're afraid of what he was going to do and so they didn't stop to try to see what he was trying to achieve they just judged him because he didn't agree with them somebody who disagrees someone who's different you fear that and through that fear you hate it hate is something that is bred by fear of the unknown I took this from a book man I wish I had have written it down now but I was just been doing a lot of study on the subject and reading different books says that they're showing how that hate is bred by it's fed by fear of the unknown fear of what might happen and fear of anything that's different than you or Falls outside your definition of what's supposed to be normal we could be this about the pettiest of things where when it comes to traditions and maybe this is a good time to deal with it well this is the way one family does one thing this is the way another family does something and we could find ourselves hating the way somebody else does something just because it's different than the way we do it well why do you hate that is it really wrong to open open all the gifts on Christmas Eve yes because we opened them all on Christmas morning and so you hate one tradition just because you're tradition's different the outcome's all the same right disappointed siblings and disappointed children but there's a fear of the unknown fear of what might happen fear of anything that's different than you wow that changes things well if I a fear of the unknown and fear of what might happen that might make sense but just fear of something that's just different than what you think is normal it breeds hatred they have a they've they've made a theory out of this and not that we need to go out and test this or anything but it's an ingroup outgroup Theory and the basis is or the thesis is when we feel threatened by perceived Outsiders we instinctively turn toward our ingroup as a survival mechanism so at the end of the day these feelings of hate is our defense mechanism against fear because now we want to redefine fear and now it's hate it's this detest and it's a survival mechanism to where now we're wanting to protect ourselves and then that just leads to a whole bunch of robust theology to justify not just your fear but now your hate as to why you are okay in hating those who aren't in the group they call it ingroup bias it's tendency to give preferential treatment or think better of those who belong to the same group those you identify with with those that you know those that you agree with those that do things the way you do it those that you understand and this and and you when you belong to something that feels a void this need for an identity you find something you can identify with and we all think this way and we all believe this way and it puts you in an ingroup and then anybody who doesn't think and feel the same way you do they're on the outside so you perceive yourself as better a a and you perceive yourself as worth protecting and worth defending and it leads now and and if I could say this I hopefully it's here in some of these scriptures and things you could see this that because you think you're right if somebody's different their different idea is a threat to whether or not your right and then our response to our own uncertainty is to hate them it's this this creating an identity around something and whenever there's a perceived threat to what you identify yourself with it provokes when there's a perceived threat it provokes fear and that fear leads us to hate those that are threatening us now I think hating something that's threatening you would be a complete we could ra we could rationalize that right that if every day somebody showed up at your door and was pushing your ring camera and saying if you come out today I'm GNA beat you up and every day ding dong and you pulled up and here's that guy that neighbor who's just threatening you so you never leave the house I mean in time you're going to hate the guy right because of fear and what it does to your life and how you having to change everything that that makes sense but yet this is this is even just a perceived threat not an actual threat Philippians 2:3 it says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory Glory but in liness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves I I I I would like to spend more time on this estimation of others but it is it is an idea of compassion and empathy sympathy if you can't muster up empathy but where there's some idea of compassion for somebody else and so it's it's not that you abandon uh it's not that you have low self-esteem but it's kind of a changing and it's certainly not covetousness or jealousy like oh I just wish I was them why well I'm just wanting to do Philippians 2:3 I think they're better than me and that's not what's you're being asked to do but let nothing be through done through Strife or vain glory and it's this idea of separating out the word strife there is politicking party making so when we say let nothing be done through Strife it's where you're going to cleave things and divide things up and create the in group and leaves others out and you don't value how somebody else feels you don't value how when somebody else is different you don't value uh uh whatever the differences might be and find some way to harmonize and get along but it's a self-promotion it's Pride it's party making it's politics let nothing be done through politics to promote yourself to gain favor to gain support to build consensus at somebody else's expense they this is I think you'll find this in a lot of places we could always consult with our our local political expert Dr coffee but the fundamental political emotion is fear fundamental political uh uh emotion is fear that if you can incite the people the passions your your argument gained and typically that most important passion is not excited about the future and wow you got some great ideas about tax reform it's usually how you better be afraid of the other guy's tax policy and wow you've got some really good ideas on how to improve the economy no it's usually being afraid of what the other guy can do to the economy and so the most fundamental political emotion is fear and if you can Stoke fear it leads to disgust it leads to anger it leads to lashing out it leads to forming if I could use a message phrase it clicks that exclusive group a privileged group that others can't just readily join and truly it's only a click if you're not in it right because if you're in it you're like I mean this isn't a click this is this is where the Eagles have been gathered right but if you're on the outside I can't believe these politic and this strife and and uh I think I've shared the story one time where somebody was complaining about their church and they said several of his families are getting together talking about how no one ever gets together with us and how this church is clickish I'm like I didn't hear that right definitely didn't hear that right run this by me again yeah several families have been getting together we've been getting together on a regular basis just talking about how about nobody in this church gets together and it's just one big click I'm like run it by me again I'm not here I'm definitely not hearing this right why because they couldn't they didn't look at their group as the click it was all the other groups they're not a part of those are clicks but it does speak to how sides are formed on things a a and an issue or situation comes up and you've got to take a side and you've got to you got to be in the EV crowd or you got to be in the combustible crowd or you got to believe recognize this and do that and so when there's sides that start to be drawn let nothing be done through Strife or politicking or party making what I'm wanting you to see in this big picture Pi if it's getting lost is that if you can be grouped that can create a distrust of anyone not in the group that breeds fear which breeds hatred and so this is how things become very divisive and this is how things begin to stir up where you feel the need to defend you feel the need to protect you feel the need to tear down and if someone's not on your side maybe you don't have a really good argument so the only thing you can do is tear down theirs or make them look bad all for the means of politicking or protecting yourself as James says it in James 3:16 for where envy and and strife is there's confusion in every evil work because of these emotions where there's been sides drawn where there's been clicks and groups separate out it's just kind of a natural process I'm in this group you're in that group oh no there's differences there's differences of opinions there's different goals there's different Ambitions there's different ideas on how things should be done I have an idea that next year I think all the sisters should throw a big cookie exchange for all the brothers if you've seen the pictures you know where I'm coming from but there's once the sides are drawn and there's opinions on how things should be done that it's natural now for people to feel defensive and to stir things up and try to bolster support and I know a lot of this can happen and it's organic and it's positive and it's good when there's differences and people try to reason together and work things out but we got to recognize the feeling that give rise to other feelings that lead to places dark places like confusion in every evil work and the sermon Fellowship brother BR says when your Soul's been washed in the blood of the Lamb actually the way he's saying this is very striking because he's saying where there's where there is the separation you don't have the Holy Ghost and so it should be challenging to us to recognize that any nature that would lead to that politicking is not the Holy Ghost we have and when your soul has been washed in the blood of the Lamb all malice hatred strife and all these things has died amen just believe it and don't resurrect it the blood makes an atonement that's the reason today in our Pentecostal fellowships in our different Full Gospel fellowships we have so much carrying on so much chasm in stuff in our body the differences the separation because our different isms remember how we brother Ram talked about those isms and how they lead to hate and things rather has set in is because that one will pull out and do this and one of them pull out and do this and one will pull out and start a denomination or organization he's he's identifying where there's a distinction that is not godly where you're not fearing the Lord there's not this uh let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but liness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves where what something is done to be against another and I think it happens so often that someone does something there's this tendency to think oh they did it again against another when you could be fearing the Lord and just obeying the Lord to do something and people think oh he must have done that against that person oh they're fearing the lord it's not a sword drawn it's not a line drawn in the sand this is an offense against anything but there's got to be a recognition when we're acting according to these isms he says starting these chasms and stuff in the body and it's set in and he says that's breeding this malice or I'm say I'm saying as it read these things it's breeding these other emotions cuz brother says notice how organization breeds hatred which destroys fellowships makes bitterness that's that anger or disappointment and here say they pull out and start an organization what's the organization going to do breed hatred against what you left and then what does that do the group that stayed or the the group that the organization that was left starts to hate the group and the group that left right and it breeds competitiveness and comparison did you stream their service did you count how many heads they had how many people were there so we I I want to capture it this way these feelings of hate that we're talking about can begin where there's an offense there's been some injury there's been some hurt there's been a wrong there's been a transgression abuse uh manipulation fraud there could be a situation happened where through some overt action or offense we're called those offenses where the hate can begin to grow but hate can also be manufactured and this is where to me it became so striking as I've been studying these things over the last while where we're experiencing deep strong feelings of hate but based upon differences not offenses where we've we're allowing them even in kind of worthless scenarios where there's real no reason why we should be feeling this way so intensely as we do but it could be manufactured in meaningless scenarios or worthless scenarios just based upon differences I don't know if any of you are familiar with it happened after Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated a third grade teacher in rville Iowa did an experiment with her class her name was Jane Elliott spelled the way Elliot spells his name the suggested owner of a new Tesla come 25th and in trying to help this her third grade students seven-year-olds to understand maybe a racial divide or hatred she divided her class by eye color and as much as I've read about it I didn't fully drill down into all the specifics and I didn't want to kind of get lost in the weeds but she divided my brown eyes and blue eyes and I'm pretty sure the class wasn't just evenly divided by that I'm sure there's maybe some other Spectrum there but it was brown eyes versus blue eyes and I think initially when she did she said we have the browney students in this group Blue Eyes in this group and the brown eyes don't have to take any tests today they have a longer uh playtime they get best food at lunch or whatever and she just gave them preferential treatment and implied and suggested as the teacher that they were Superior than the blue-eyed kids and she switched it around and did it I think the next day kind of flipped the tables a little bit but the word that was used is that it turned these seven-year-olds into hate mongers and they the BL brown-eyed kids ridiculed the blue-eyed kids they shunned them they wouldn't have anything to do with them now that you had the brown-eyed group that had privileges they didn't want to have anything to do with the blue-eyed kids who didn't and they spoke very hatefully they shunned and they ridiculed and they made fun of and just by putting kids into categories based upon eye color made these groups hate each other and this is what Miss Elliott had to say I watched what had been marvelous Cooperative wonderful thoughtful children man what kind of corn are they feeding those kids seven-year-olds oh marvelous and cooperative and wonderful thoughtful children turned into nasty vicious discriminating little third graders in a space of 15 minutes that's a phrase that's never been uttered nasty vicious discriminating little third graders in a space of 15 minutes she says in 15 minutes I turned seven-year-olds into hate mongers just by putting them into groups based nothing nothing makes a real difference right unless you're Aryan or something like that I said no the blue eyes they're definitely better blond haired blue I preferred right there might be some kind of History where that's kind of baked into your theology but this is just innocent third graders they haven't been taught to hate on that level yet but just by putting them in these arbitrary groups they now said well comparing themselves felt better than the other group now it's important to note that the teacher instigated all this they wouldn't have come up with this on their own and I identify that for you to recognize how that someone with the inference of authority clear Authority in this instance was able to manufacture hatred where it hadn't been before and a lot of people may look at these situations I'll read another one here I think we used when we were doing the who's my neighbor series a few years ago that we might look at say oh wow what a social experiment notice just how easy it is for people in groups to hate but here there was this overt pressure and a seeding of superiority in a language being used by someone with uh uh with with power and saying this to these children and that ultimately at the end of the day is what prompted them to hate they didn't they didn't divide themselves into these groups it was an influence that did it Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter 10:12 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend our themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise who are themselves there's a lot of them we and it's kind of ironic what he says here in context we do not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves through the comparisons they are they compare themselves among themselves they're not wise if I could say it this way it's not wise to draw conclusions about yourself based upon your comparison to somebody else good or bad it's not good to draw conclusions about ourselves based upon our comparison to others we might do that sometimes to make ourselves feel good when something happens like well at least I'm not like that or I've never done that and there's this idea sometimes we're trying to make ourselves feel good about ourselves because of how bad somebody else can be but then there's also this inverse that we compare ourselves to somebody else we can begin to envy and by comparison we find our differences and where there's differences it can breed this fear of a perceived threat he says it's not wise why because it leads to contention it leads to Strife it leads to division ISS it's not the Peaceable wisdom from above this was the experiment that we had mentioned to you before uh you know some of you may recall this but it's called the robbers cave experiment done at the robbers cave uh State Park in Oklahoma and they took 22 boys that were 11 years old and they brought him to a fake summer camp and they divided him into two teams you had the Eagles and the Rattlers serpents we're already choosing sides who we want to win and they they brought him to this fake summer camp and it's all for the purpose of examining group dynamics and the the the professor who was doing this had an agenda and he had something in in his mind he was trying to recreate he T tried two other times and it really didn't work or not the way that he wanted it to and so they have one group get there early and then they bring the other group in later and they both don't know about each other and so they separate these groups and they allowed them to give themselves names and they begin to identify and rally around one another but then they begin to cause them to compete in various activities and all the while the adults are administering this experiment on these kids for these three weeks without the parents knowing by the way it's a lot of ethical concerns with how this was done could never do it today this is in 1954 but they just by allowing these two groups to have these identities and then committ to compete with one another they begin to show this increasing hostility which ultimately escalated into violence where uh the it was probably the Rattlers that invaded the Eagle camp in the middle of the night and terrorized and were angry and rude and mean and and they began to act in these very aggressive ways and it became violent and so this is what and it was real genuine feeling of hatred for the other group now this was what the the the scientists want to conclude is just by putting people into groups they can learn to hate the other but when you really look at it someone was instigating it it was meaningless this is the part I want you to catch it wasn't like you put a group of guys in a campsite and made them compete against one another in different activities and they just started to hate one another you had the the administrators of this experiment provoking it in seeding it they would actually go into the the campground and steal a steal a sleeping bag and turn things over and pour water all over their beds and then say somebody must have done this to you it must have been the Eagles that's right and they're manufacturing hatred as a matter of fact in one of the groups where they allowed the all as a group to get together and they all kind of became friends and they had their friendships and they noticed who had kind of partnered up and who knew each other and so they tried to divide the friends and put them in this group and put them in that group and they tried to get them to hate each other but they couldn't and they eventually turned against the counselors why because the counselors were the antagonist and it provoked hate but what I want you to recognize is these the way things can be manipulated in meaningless differences and with these meaningless grouped identities become a basis for hate that's what I began to realize there's a synthetic hate that the devil's trying to put on us amen we we we there's one if I could say one pure hatred and that's for evil everything else is a manufactured hatred that the devil's trying to put on us where we have some sort of group Identity or some sort of differences and some perceived threat and allows us to be hostile and violent persecute hate something different than us Paul says this in Ephesians chapter 5 says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God to submit it means to range I know to to say submit it kind of has this idea of one's one's on top and one's on bottom one's higher one's lower but if you submit yourselves one to another think even that language suggests that if we have to submit ourselves to each other it has more to do with Arrangement as opposed to one being greater or better than the other it's to arrange together even to arrange under or to subject one to but notice it says in the fear of God so there's one thing that we submit to we're arranged under a common faith we submit to one another under a common trust in God a common belief and conviction in God brother Brandon when he's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ Revelations chapter 4 part 3 he says submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor Pastor submit yourself to your congregation if a little click Rises up don't be on either side submit yourself to the whole congregation congregation if you start in a click submit yourself to your pastor in the fear of God this is this is the solution as I was reading these things and going over this these things it's spoke to me how that this is where our trust is we trust in the Lord not some sort of arbitrary arrangement we we we're not even trusting in this grouping we're trusting in the Lord and because we can trust in the Lord we can submit ourselves to one another we're not trusting that we're the group that's right we're not trusting that we're the only group that's got it we're not trusting in ourselves to be able to pull this off we've submitted ourselves to the Lord and he says whenever there's a grouping that starts taking place he says if a little click Rises up he says don't take sides submit yourselves together rally together find your common basis find your common trust we may not be able to trust one another when it comes to these other differences but we can trust in him and it becomes this solution to fear and anger and perceived threat to where we're fearing the right thing and because I fear the right thing I'm not going to let my fear of the wrong thing instigate me to wrong things if there's a click that starts up submit yourself submit yourself to the fear of the Lord Proverbs 19:23 says the fear of the Lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil the fear of the Lord tendeth to life the fear of the wrong thing tends to death when we're fearful it just drains us right when you're afraid of something that anxiety inducing emotions and what the physiological process that takes place it's fear is rooted even in the way that they uh look at the uh evolution of our brains and how they develop that this fear is so rooted in survival it's so rooted in in in the threat of life and the and being threatened to death fear of the Lord though tends to life he that hath shall abide satisfied and not be visited with evil brother Bram says in the sermon pal Locust cankerworm caterpillar he says notice Faith the true Faith the real Faith the the faith we take our churches today look at us look at our Pentecostal people look at our Baptist people our Presbyterian nazarin Pilgrim Holiness and the brandom Tabernacle all of us we're guilty of not earnestly contending for that faith and this is what he so earnestly contending for their faith and then notice what he BRS brings it to a little fuss can come up in the church in the brandom Tabernacle goes I'm at home I could talk about you now he said a little fuss can come up in the church and they'll form a little quick click and one get on one side and one on the other and and just drawing now from what we've identified in the scripture and just in Human Experience how that groupings insights fussing and stewing and disagreement and combating and wrestling and finagling and that's what becomes the hatred and the animosity so they'll form a little click and one get on one side and one on the other he says is that contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints does that sound like the apostolic Doctrine no sir brother noce how once again he's kind of hitting at this idea that we can have all we're Apostolic the restoration of the apostolic and there can be this veneer of being Apostolic but where there's hatred you cannot be true Apostolic you can have all the veneer of Pentecostalism but if you have hatred that cannot be original Pentecost he says is that contending for the faith when we're contending with one another when we're click defending and click building it's where where he says we've left we're not contending for the faith in other words we're not submitting to the faith where the fear of the Lord is it tends to life where there's a fear of other ideas and other things it tends to death we know there's liar in the world we know there's false Doctrine we know there's enemies of the message we know there's enemies of the Cross but we shouldn't be afraid of them we shouldn't allow all the differences and disagreements and all the saber rattling and all the as I call it the chip chipmunks that are chirping and everything all those things that are taking place and the squirrels that are barking trying to get our attention don't be afraid of them amen but abide satisfied why because you fear the lord because I trust in the Lord I'm free from Fear because I trust in the Lord I'm free from bitterness doesn't mean there's not evil trying to provoke me doesn't mean there's not things out there taking place that are causing me to try to hate but trus in the Lord keeps the evil away I will abide satisfied and I won't be visited with that evil hate because I fear the lord I'm not going to allow so now we'll just kind of close that thought a little bit I'm not going to allow the fear of others who are different from me or the fear of other groups the fear of other ideas provoke me to hate those that are different or have other ideas I won't do it I'll fear the lord that's what I that's who I will trust is the Lord amen but now me close the service with this and close it just it's like you can close a series with like four Services right so let me close with this this is my final thought on this today hate is sometimes born not just from things that we fear that are different to us but we hate because we fear what may be true about ourselves kind it's a as we mentioned earlier it's a survival mechanism that we're not willing to admit what may be true about ourselves we don't really want to face the of what might be right about ourselves so it's kind of self-defense and and I'm wanting to address this and again I've been told that this is heavy I kind of like the way one brother put it it's challenging and I know this is challenging but if God can speak to our hearts to this it's liberating that sometimes we cling to hatred we can cling to bitterness and resentment all these things we cling to it because without it we'll be we'll be forced to deal with our own weaknesses the as long as I'm preoccupied with this hate as long as I'm holding this offense as long as I'm grudging then it becomes a buffer becomes some sort of distance and I can hold on to that and it's distracting but if I ever let go of my hate I'll have to address what's in me I'll have to address my own faults I'll have to address my own pain and sometimes we don't want to address the pain so we just we keep addressing the offense because we want to address the damage we keep addressing the offender because we don't want to address the pain this may seem to be a little bit of a unique scripture to use in light of that but in Matthew 7: 1 to5 it says judge not that ye be not judged this is that giving of an opinion uh expressing something for with what judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with what what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again and so it's a caution against the opinions that we offer and how quick we are to judge others and say what whatever judgment you have to somebody else you're going to be judged by it so maybe that's why we just keep judging so that there's never an opportunity to be judged I don't know if this is similar but it's it's in the sense that as long as I keep judging I I won't give you a chance to judge me I won't give a chance for judgment to come back on me it's kind of that game where it's like you let's see who can hit the person the softest right and so you let the other guy go first and they're just kind of like and then you just go you win right or if I if I hit you with if I if I could crack two eggs on your head I'll give you 20 bucks right and like okay sure I can clean up right two eggs so then you just crack one and walk away it's like there's a way that we we're engaged in this game where as long as I'm in control of the rules it's never going to come back on me and then it says why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye the the sliver the Splinter but consider it's not the beam that is in thine own eye it I this is Jesus this is what I use to justify my being dramatic uh whenever there's a disagreement but he's he's this exaggeration like your friend has a sliver it's not even really discernible and you're beholding it and you're fixated on it and you're running them down and you're critical but yet you've got a worse problem right or how Willl thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye there's a lot we can amplify in this but he says Thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye now it is remarkable that Jesus is saying you know the sliver in his eye is not being is not permissible it should be addressed but he's identifying the hypocrisy and how we can we could be so fixated and stirred up by something that's really trivial or small in someone else's life but it's a means of distracting us from addressing the big things in our own lives said another way a Critic usually and rarely sees in himself what he so readily sees in somebody else many times we'll identify in others things that we're unwilling to identify in ourselves recently I think we used the scripture and said it's the pot calling the kettle black what is the pot doing it's projecting now catch this part we're going to we're ending on this thought of this projecting the the pot is black and it projects its own Blackness onto the kettle and judges the kettle not because it is in fact black but it's projected its characteristics onto something else and therefore criticizes and belittles and says things that are not true about the kettle but true of itself cuz the pot calling the kettle black the kettle polished reflective and the pot is seen itself in the kettle not even a true representation of the kettle it's called projection it's the process of displacing your own feelings onto someone or something else what projection is we tend to attack in others what we find ugly or unacceptable in ourselves I'm glad to get a little bit of a right and some amens there it wasn't completely dead silent one of the kids said H we tend to lash out at detest things that we find ugly not about somebody else but in ourselves and it's done in order to defend ourselves to distract ourselves from our own weaknesses by focusing on the weaknesses of others it's kind of the this idea of saying I'm not a bad person you are I'm not selfish you are I'm not buying a Tesla you are there's these ideas and these Notions where we don't want to put these feelings in our in our hearts we we don't want to be we don't want to admit this is how it is and it's the roots of the fear of rejection the fear of being alone so we're constantly having to build ourselves up we're constantly trying to make ourselves feel good and so we we hate and we have these feelings of hatred because we're afraid that we're wrong we're afraid of being alone we're afraid of being rejected and so there's a tendency to hate and we could say may be reject or despised if you want to use some softer word words to hate what we don't like about ourselves and that's why Jesus says you're a hypocrite in reality you hate the beam in your eye and that's why their moat bothers you so much in job 36:13 you say what does this have to do with hate but the Hypocrites in heart Heap up wrath they cry not when he binded them there's a lot that's being said here in this particular portion In this passage and how that the Hypocrites in heart will Heap up the Wrath of the Lord they cry not when he bindeth them there's this there's certainly this picture that's being drawn of how the hypocrite is only reserving himself for judgment and judgment is going to be visited on him but a hypocrite is one who pretends to have something he does not have or pretends to be something that he is not and he says the hypocrite in heart is heaping up wrath and what a hypocrite heart will do when one is a hypocrite they condemn themselves and it leads to a hatred even a hatred or detesting of themselves as they say there's not no such thing as a conscious hypocrite why they sear themselves ultimately in the hate which they once had for themselves they project upon other people and hatred just this hypocrisy will Heap up wrath why because they're unwilling to address their own weaknesses and they're projecting it on other people and they're placing blame on other people and they're saying that other people are wrong and other people the reason why things are this way and other other people are this the other people are that and because they want to find someone else to blame for their situation it leads them to hate the people they've LED themselves to blame because it says they cry not when he bindeth them in other words they're not willing to admit that their afflictions are their cause they're not willing to admit that they have brought it upon themselves they do not cry when he bindeth them they're this isn't my fault I'm not going to say forgive me I'm not going to own it I'm going to push it off on somebody else and say it's your fault yeah you did this we mentioned before DC Stevenson and how he was the builder of the clan in Indiana the Grand Dragon and he actually built it to be the largest and most influential and this is all in the time where brother brandham is a child is coming into his ministry the influence the clan bought church after church after church influen Pulpit after Pulpit after pulpit in order to spread their propaganda they did a lot of deeds in the community that's why even the clan had paid for brother bram's medical bills I believe and things like that because they were seeking to buy influence and he said I did not sell the clan in Indiana on hatreds I've shared this with you already he didn't sell it on hatreds he didn't go and say you should hate this person you should hate this person he sold it on americanism so they told a story and they spun a yarn and us that as a means to provoke you just walk up to somebody say I want you to hate him it's probably not going to be effective but if I could tell you a story of what him did to you can tell you a story about what's happening and what their plans are and what they're going to do and how they're going to scheme I can lead you to hate by selling you on an ism without telling you to hate and this is what one of the writers about him kind of biographical account of him said he understood people's fears and their need to blame others for their failures this is what leads to hate is our fear and not just our fear of those that are different but our need to blame others for our own mistakes he discovered that if he said something often enough no matter how untrue people would believe it we're not talking about Trump we're talking about DC Stevenson now no matter how untrue people would believe it small lies were for the timid the key to telling a big lie was to do it with conviction and it wasn't hate them it was a untruth it was a lie all for the purpose of stoking some sort of love for something but Inspire in order to inspire hate for something else and what made the Clans hate so great what made it so diabolical and evil is because they knew what people were afraid of and their need to blame others for their fears the fear of something different and even the fear of what was in ourselves and how quickly we could project onto something else musicians if you'd come and what time I am afraid I will trust in thee faith is a deliberate trust it's a deliberate confidence in this will I be confident that word confident there could have been translated in this will I trust when I'm afraid of my enemy when I'm afraid of myself I will not abandon my trust in him because I don't want to hate there's no value in hatred it's costic it's a poison there's no value in fear there's no value in worry that's why I ask the question where's the trust there's a trust they even if they take a distinction in our English usage that confidence would be something that would be internal whether or not you have confidence in yourself and that trust would be something maybe that you would have towards somebody else or in somebody else so confidence is Maybe by internal means and trust is external where someone has earned your trust and maybe we could even go through that route in the semantics of that just to show that there's ways that we could put confidence in the flesh and that's a bad thing but then there's a point to where we have so much fear so much worry so much negativity and so much low self-esteem that we're not even willing to accept the grace that says you're more than a match for the devil in Christ that through Christ I can do all things and that I that he is my sufficiency so if our confidence is in the flesh and you're trusting in yourself at what time you're afraid I'm going to trust in myself to gut through this at what time I'm afraid I'm going to trust in myself to get over this at what time my enemy encamps itself against me I'm going to trust in my Superior intellect in order to thwart his ad uh his advances you're going to end up hating you know why cuz you fail because you lose and you hate yourself you hate your enemy you hate those who rallied against you all because you trust in the wrong thing so we read earlier in Hebrews chapter 13 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee that's where we put the trust so that we may boldly say this is what we might boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me it notice what he's saying man can do things to you but I'm not going to fear it he doesn't say the Lord is my helper and man won't do anything to me he just says I won't fear what man will do to me because the Lord is my helper I I'm crying this out to you in light of this subject of hate that we ought to trust in him when it's when the world is coming against us and ideas are thrown at us and family members uh persecute us whatever it might be trust in him don't cast off your faith don't try to get into a battle of wits or intellect or try to prove this or prove that in the presence of hate I'll Trust in his presence in the presence of my adversary I'll run to my Advocate I'm going to trust in him because that's where my peace is that's where my strength is that's where my love is that's my shelter against the hate and if I can stay there trusting I won't be hating myself I'll be able to have the right kind of response in the face of hate that actually turns the aggressor says wait a minute you're not going to return it wait a minute you're not going to treat me bad wait a minute you're not going to cuss at me like I just cussed at you wait a minute you're not doing what you used to do when I did that to you I used to be able to do this to you because I'd get a rise out of you and it it turn into something get big and I'd always feel better about myself being backslid because you would act unlike a Christian whenever I provoked you wait why aren't you doing it now you're taking away my justification yes because you trust in the Lord trust in him whether there be offenses real or imagined yes made up untruths or differences that are real or maybe just worthless maybe it's just synthetic maybe it's the devil that went in there and rearranged your bed and told you your sister did it all just to see whether how easily it would be for you to hate now I'm not saying that literally could happen I'm just but the things that happen in our lives where it's synthetic hate you don't hate that person why because there's no cause it's not just your hatred is reserved for sin your hatred reserved for evil and the devil's allowed you to project this onto something else you said no I'm taking it off them I'm taking it off them I'm taking it off myself I'm not going to even hate myself I'm going to love him I'm going to trust him I'm going to have confidence in [Music] him because our worth your value your security is in himen there's Worth to us there's value in US there's value in you there's a reason to have positive good self-esteem there's a lie of the devil that wants to turn us into these Catholics that are just always beating ourselves up and oh wo is me and trying to do penants enough of that enough of the self-hate enough of projecting hate on other people because what we hate on ourselves enough of hating those that we fear and perceive there's enough hate because of injury and offenses I'm going to trust in him this quote just kept coming back up to me and surfacing when I was studying on this series maybe today we're just wrapping this up this morning on the subject of hate and where is the peace and where's the love where's the strength where's the confidence Now where's the trust I know this might seem to be a little bit of a different angle because it's not so much looking at hate but it's looking at a real proposition says if I was going to die in the morning if I was sentenced to death if they were building The Gallows if they were getting the needle ready if they were dusting off the chair whatever it might be that's going to die in the morning what good would it do for me to get all stewed up about it what value what benefit would it be for me to fuss and toew and fret get on nervous and worried what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow what good would that do to to work to me what good would that do me to worry about it there's no value in worry it just brings us down it it melts us away it's costic it's corrosive I can say the same thing that's what our fear does right what does it lead to hate he says well you say what good would it do to have faith faith can sign my pardon what good what good would it do he says sure there is value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe that's what I'm expressing to you in light of this subject that's challenging or heavy however you want to look at it don't be fearful don't be scared don't be upset at what time you're afraid trust in him there's no value in your fear there's no value in your hatred there's no value in your resentment there's no value in your word there's no value in fretting brother Alfonso I notice sister M Soul isn't with us today I see you there with your children utum and ulyses and there's a promise that your wife's going to be sitting next to you whatever the reason is she's not here there's no fear no fear no worry why there's no value in it there's no benefit doesn't matter what things could be added up and what things could be presented it it there's no value I'm not going to trust in that I'm not going to trust in this I'm not going to trust in that I'm not going to trust in the forecast I'm not going to trust in the symptoms I'm not going to trust in the arguments I'm not going to trust in the threats if Satan is threatening you don't trust in his ability to carry out the threat just trust in God's ability to see you through it you say well Satan I believe you're more than able to do exactly what you said you're going to do but I trust in my God more to bring me through it even to the point where Paul felt as if the threats were going to take his life and he trusted not in himself and he didn't trust in any else to save him he didn't even trust that God would save him from Death he said I trusted in a God that would raise the dead Hallelujah Checkmate game over in the end my God is able to help me the Lord is my strength the Lord is my helper I will not fear trust in him with all that is in you and let's be conscious and aware of all these little things that happen to try to inspire hate and hopefully it's give us some some language scriptural language and some message materials in our heart to hold on to to annihilate hate that tries to come around Merry Christmas stand with me
