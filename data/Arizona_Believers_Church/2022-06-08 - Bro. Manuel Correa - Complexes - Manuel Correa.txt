TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i feel happy tonight my family because my family is here misposa my my son and my wife and my mother-in-law also all one of my best friends are here emanuel pineda brother emmanuel pineda and speaking of behalf of my own experience of what i went through through my life of how the lord spoke to me many things i'd like you to please stand just to for the honor of the reading of the word let's open our bibles to exodus the third chapter verse 1. now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mount of god even to reb is and the angel of the lord appeared onto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burned and with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great site why the bush is not burned for the talk tonight we'll get to know each other a bit more how do we behave because each and every single one of us we are a result or a product of the environment which we were raised and many times we commit the error of the mistake [Music] i'm the youngest son of my parents now one of my traumas or complexes it really cost me a lot to speak in public one of the first traumas that i had to overcome how did he conquer you it's a mystery it's a mystery god gave me a work that he was helping me with my complex i'm a barber entonces so he put the people in my chair and i had to start learning an and god gave me that work and he helped me with that work i liken if you read the third second and third verses we know that god was preparing him for a work that was to be done but but moses did not know else that he was going to a path of a work that god was preparing him for and i believe all of us find ourselves in that similar situation i believe every single one of us can identify with several scriptures in the bible if you go back and read the third and fourth verse you're going to find moses started to take all of his complexes towards the calling of god no hablo bien i don't speak good no puedes for me you can't send someone else instead of me and many times as christians that happens as humans and many times we give that victory to the devil we're always claiming that we're children of the great god we always go with the banner of faith that we have a king then we start to take out our complexes we don't even give the devil an opportunity to come and tell us where we're wrong puerto because we already from the get-go we get rid of our we share our complexes just like moses he took out so many complexes that he got god mad and i identify myself with that we proclaim to have the light of this day but if we were to put the practice this message remember one occasion i went to mexico i was a company a minister of the church that i used to go to the penis tabernacle of the phoenix tabernacle yes this young lady asked advice for this brother [Music] like she didn't like the advice that she was given but i heard that she was asking advice from the brother yes this young lady was raised in the house of the message i don't think we should go you want me to answer you what you want to hear what the word of god says that's sometimes what the people are looking for they're looking for a minister applicable that i applied it to my own self what does the message say if you're doubting something get away from it get away from it it's that simple that's the powerful message that we believe that he's given us the simple things it's not complicated things i tried to make god a grandfather i don't know how many of you have tried to make god a grandfather we all know that god does not have grandchildren so musicos but how did i try to make god a grandfather through my mother i remember how she prayed for uh she raised the god through her raise up a dead kid that was just happened to pass away you know that that got me so damaged because i began to to depend on about the faith of my mother instead of me having a relationship with god yes i sort of depend more on the faith of my mom there was a time where i didn't even pray anymore i had so much confidence to do whatever i wanted to do purchase i had a sickness please pray for me we know that god does not like that he wants a relationship with every single one of us all of our defects now she already passed away 11 years ago hermann brothers i'm not sure what was the greatest impact when i heard that she passed away accidentally she passed away in a car accident when they told me two of the four passengers in the car accident passed it hurt me a lot and it keeps hurting me not that the pain has gone away but when i started to meditate said with me my mom my mom left myself for me not only did my mom leave my mediator between me and god has has left hermanos bro that was a great impact for me now i had to face god to draw an eye onto god render me adios to surrender to god to believe that he also hears me and that's the path that we've been following ever since possibly i don't have the faith that she once had or she has peros but i thanks be to god but i believe with all of my heart signs follow the believers we just only have to believe it you know when i was called to the ministry [Music] i was called to help a mission in mexico and my first reaction was i said i've never preached what am i going to do i told my pastor in that moment when he was sending me was that i've never preached nothing especially i have no experience how am i going to do this we're speaking on the phone remember he just kept a moment of silence and he said i'm not sending you to preach you know mr stoy mandando i'm only sending you to show love to the people and that's going to open any door later i understood more the complexes return and one of my mistakes are trying to be zealous to the word of god trying to get the people to do what the word of god says and the rest of it he takes care of it i i've noticed this because i had a family member in mexico that he's an alcoholic in mexico i'm going to tell you why it was a mistake the time went on when i saw that when he looked at me and when he saw me instead of approaching me he got away from me i noticed the mistake that i was doing because i wanted him i wanted to preach the word of god to him cinema without love when i understood kemi vida that my life habla mask speaks louder than words and i begin to accept him the way he was showing him my life the relationship changed and in that way i began to conquer him and then that's the way that and the path we're going son those are things that i've learned in the way otra kosa what attitude do we have you know i like to read the dictionary a lot [Music] i rejoice a lot when i when i read the dictionary because it gives me certain definitions it helps me understand the bible spiritual because that's what the prophet said attitude when i come to church every moment that we do says something about us in business and at times nosotros we commodienzia as an audience podemos we can assert make it more easier al predicador for the preacher el tiempo the time atmosphere the atmosphere or difficile or we can make it more difficult [Music] especially when expressing a state of mind that's something that i like that a lot of those are simple things i believe with all of my heart simple things it makes a difference in a true christian believer especially it says body posture especially when expressing a state of mind and that helped me to understand a lot of things that when i come to the house of the lord i even have to be careful how i sit because you're showing locust of what i'm expecting from god remember one thing remember god promised joshua that no one none of his soldiers but he began to lose soldiers now brother branham compares it to the church what is it if my attitude yes in the service there's no healing every single one of us depend on each other when we're here in the house of the lord because every single one of us make the atmosphere and even even thinking and one occasion i was in my car and i was thinking the hope and i was listening to the to the book of job and i began to laugh within myself cuando escuche when i heard that god impeso that he began diablo began to challenge the devil a cerca de la vida the hope concerning the life of job that you're making plans about my life without consulting me all diablo that you're sending me to the devil approval so you can try me si cuentos what would be your attitude about that how will we receive that that there were plans made about our life without consulting us even passing certain scriptures they say in segunda and it even says in second kings cinco uno five one a cerca general speaking of a certain general questini aleppra who had leprosy established with a certain attitude that they were going to treat him right to receive him correctly because of his post middleman look brothers i was one of those christians back then i was too good to be criticized to find all the defects in the service el menos but i was the least this puesto that was willing to help when it was required when you come seeking something here at church we're gonna find it what is our attitude coming the prophet didn't even come out to see him and he sent one of his servants to go tell him what he had to do he told us all of this it strikes me mismo i speak it for my own self what happens if one day i go see the pasture consider the problem with a certain issue and he has no time to come and see me what is my attitude it wasn't working out how he had it in his mind what if we apply that to every situation in our lives it doesn't go out to see the issue that we have or the deacons the bible says that one of his servants had to go out convince him to obey the word of god of what the prophet said and by obeying the word of the prophet to come to his healing what he wanted for him to come and the way he wanted it to come strike me a lot we know that this woman had faith and she wanted to touch the mantle the clothing of jesus christ and you know what's my problem um the offense that he gave on to her perro he called her dog yes towards the people you know not so long ago i found myself with a jehovah witness he wanted to argue with me with the word of god we don't want a person already arguing or arguing with arguing or with anger and arguing it's not worth it to speak no because no he's no longer in the attitude of wanting to learn you have plenty i've learned questions we can make that person sin against god so this person told me says do you believe in jesus i turned around as jehovah witness accident asking me that leo i said knowing you i didn't believe that you guys believed in the new testament no see my jose crema testament so yeah yeah yes we believe in the new testament he says and what name do you baptize i said christopher the name of jesus christ says you're a catholic [Music] what name do you baptize in the number of padres and holy ghosts don't matter we're catholic brethren it was a catholic church he started baptizing in the name of jesus christ i said no i said it even better if you find alien in la biblia someone in the bible but in the bible in la reina valera in the king james i i'll give you an opportunity to baptize me in that manner no he says no no no no no no no they say this is just saying no no no what do we say when paul says there's only one baptism unsolved one spirit yes and one body because and i'm sure he was already screaming if you think i'm here mistaken and if i believe that you're mistaken i'm going regardless you pray for me please i started to think senor gracias i said thank you lord you lost victoria i felt it as a victory because i didn't fell into the provocation maybe we would have fought in a theological battle for me my day wasn't that bad he's also but if you know how to deal with the client elba is going to feel que nostamando poder sobreus that he's not taking power over you yes the same thing in the spiritual in cada cosa que pasamos and everything that we go through remember one thing that anger is when we get angry because we're entering in a very delicate atmosphere remember one thing we can make more damage with any other weapon we have in our hands i'd like to thank our brother for allowing us to speak and to share this evening testimonial it's a bit of my testimony me truly las cosas i like to take things to the most simplest way i can use this is why the message came to bring it to the simple albert einstein the the atomic you can explain to the atomic theory but he couldn't write a phone number down maybe we can explain all the mysteries in the bible and that is the difference what makes the difference has el mundo towards the world to the outside and there we go and brother branham says [Music] this is very easy to come and testify here at church where there's no light the message be certain of god what we need today is not an abundance of material things we already have that no necesitamos iglesias grandes we don't need large churches congregations we don't need bigger congregations not television we don't necessarily more on the radio or on television no necesitamos tantas de estas cosas we don't need so many more of these things but necessitate but what we need today spiritualis to be spiritual persona is a person who will humble himself before god even if he's penniless and pray until that spirit within este is satisfied with the goodness of god and a revival takes place placed inside of your heart that changes your attitudes in the atmosphere in which that person lives [Music] to heavenly places yes [Music] weakest link [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you took them out of schools you took him out of the of congress [Music] you took him out of his own house you ran him out and now you want god to come and fix everything god is a gentleman [Music] he is where you allow him to be [Music] i believe that with all of my heart [Music] what is our attitude what do we come tonight now i come from a place [Music] and many times that helps [Music] sometimes people have to walk two hours to walk to church they don't have any air conditioning and many other things [Music] [Music] let us we come to this place [Music] [Music] with a correct attitude lord desiring more from you senor lorde that tonight that every one of us may receive what we come looking for jesus like jesus said your faith has saved thee allow us to have that faith [Music] [Music] that we're just [Music] [Music] we place yourselves in your hands in the name of jesus christ amen amen the lord bless you
