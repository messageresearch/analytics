TRANSCRIPT
========================================
standing together let's turn to ruth chapter one and ruth chapter one i'd like to read verses 19 to 22. we're coming to the end here of chapter one and we've taken a little bit different title we had been ministering um on the bread of life and kind of began with that thought on being hungry and the hunger and thirst that's within the bride's heart for the word of god and we're gonna change the titling now a little bit but we're still in the book of ruth to bringing forth the bride so we were talking about the bread of life and now we're looking on the bride coming forth there's something that brings her forth and calls her on the scene ruth chapter 1 verse 19. so they too went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said and that they theirs in the in the hebrew is feminine and so it really speaks of the women the women said is this naomi and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara the almighty have dealt very bitterly with me i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest it was actually that phrase i think we begin with come to bethlehem it says they came to bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest if we could just bow our heads in prayer heavenly father as we stand in your divine presence this evening we're so grateful for the blessings that you have poured out upon us lord those are the ones that we're conscious of we thank you for them and there's so many that if we began to offer thanksgiving we would find ourselves just over and over again thinking of something new and something recent and even things from our past so significant we begin to pour out praise to you and thanksgiving and lord those are just the things that we are mindful of and conscious of and things that we have recognized surely lord there's so many things that you do on a daily basis and moment to moment to protect us and to keep us and already making provisions in the future for us in the present time that we're not even aware of so we just give you thanksgiving to be something lacking right now in our lives whether it be physical or financial or emotional we can just thank you knowing that you're already setting things in motion to meet that need and though we may not see it now lord may we just believe by faith that it's coming i ask that you encourage the people tonight as they have gathered together not for church lord but for communion with you may you commune with them through the word may you speak to them and encourage them and comfort them we ask that you take the words which we've read tonight and just unfold them to us as a in a way that only you can bless us now we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and you may be seated so the statement that we've been working from is from the rapture when brother branham's identifying the shout voice and trump and he refers to the shout as the message or a message and you know he talks about a messenger and then he says he makes the statement the living bread of life bringing forth the bride and uh it's he doesn't quite say that um in that those details really anywhere else that's specifically the living bread of life bringing forth the bride but you'll find there's a number of different places and we'll touch on a few of them tonight where he's using this thought of a birthing forth and a bringing forth of the body of christ and coming on the scene for the bride and so he uses his phrase the living bread of life bringing forth it's from this living bread of life and the characteristics and the dynamics of this living bread of life that brings forth the bride and i personally have been looking at this phrase the living bread of life bringing forth the bride and identifying how it's portrayed in ruth so when we begin in verse 1 and begin to go just very methodically through each verse we can see that there's a bringing forth of ruth there's a coming of ruth out of moab into into bethlehem judah and this is this is portraying even our journey as individuals and we see this beautiful type of the bride in roof and when he says this phrase bringing forth i was pondering the meaning of this phrase this week and it means to give birth to so it could be to bring forth i would suggest even a birthing or to produce the bringing forth is to produce or to give rise to so something raises up as the result of something and it even speaks of an introduction if something brings forth something they're introducing it they're forerunning it if something is bringing forth they produce it or they give birth to it they give rise to it so it's the living bread of life that produces the bride it's the living bread of life that's bringing giving rise to the bride and in john chapter 6 verse 35 and we looked at several of these scriptures at the outset and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life they're looking to natural bread that may feed the natural body now he begins to speak in the spiritual sense i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst so christ is the one that satisfies the thirst christ is the one that satisfies the hunger and we know that food is an attraction i don't know in our church experience and i look out upon a congregation that's probably spent um all their lives um if not most of their lives in church and you'll find that there's certain times when you have a church function and there's people that'll show up when there's a when there's a meal that never come otherwise and i've i've had church experiences where you could have a church service and a meal afterwards and people actually show up for the meal not for the church service or you could have a wedding they don't come for the wedding but they come for the wedding reception because there's free food and so food can be quite a tremendous attraction can i get an amen food can be a great attraction and so there is christ then in that kind of that thought process he says i am the bread of life and since it's not a bread that everyone desires and it's not a bread that everyone's aware of yet to the elect they recognize and through their own hunger that they have the spiritual hunger that they have him being the bread of life and him being the water this well of living water he becomes an attraction and that's what causes them to come forth there's no bread there's no well then they just remain in their state of need in their state of desperation their state of crying out but what we can begin to identify and recognize is that christ the bread of life appears makes himself known calls to your heart and it's it's that that brings the bride out of you we can look at our lives and say well i haven't always acted like the bride i haven't i've always acted like i acted like the elect but it was in you the election was always in you bride material is in you the calling is in you and but what it takes to bring that out of you is christ and so if there's a little bit too much of you that you see these days and you look in the mirror and you don't like what you see then let's stop looking at natural things look to supernatural things look more to the word as brother israel poe would say you know read the bible man get into the word of god and that's going to bring out the deity in you it's going to be the it's going to be what brings it out so christ says i am the bread of life he that cometh to me so it's a draw it's an attraction it's what brings you forth and so it's christ when brother bram says the living bread of life bringing forth the bride there has to be a manifestation and a revealing of christ in order to bring forth the bride that has to be that that's what draws her forth and just a way of trying to help you to understand and i know that this has been expressed to you before that even in our our western uh wedding uh ceremonies it's the bridegroom that makes his appearance first and that lets you know ceremony's on it's begun there's times you can wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and you know when is this thing's going to kick off when did this thing begin but as soon as the bridegroom comes forth from that chamber and takes his position on the platform you know that things have been set in motion and if he's not there at the platform she's not going to be coming forth the bride is not going to come forth down the aisle and so it's him his presence is the bridegroom that becomes the draw and the attraction for the bride to come forth and so it's christ that brings forth the bride now if you'll look in ruth chapter 1 and we were skipping over verse 19 i guess in our slides and didn't necessarily uh wasn't trying to make any point in doing that but it says so they went until they came to bethlehem naomi ruth are coming to bethlehem and as they come they they come to the city people recognize them recognize naomi everyone recognizes recognizes naomi and and it said in such a way to where it would seem like they were together and there was a group even in some some of the writings and commentaries they say that they were coming back from the offering of a feast and they were coming back from uh from one of these festivals and as they came back and these people are all together there in the city and they see naomi coming and the people are moved and then the women say oh isn't this naomi and one of the things that stands out when you read this and i'm kind of maybe just backtracking on some of the things we discussed before i it really it kind of narrows it down to recognize that elimelech may have been one of few who fled even to the point where it was that their presence was missed and when they see them coming back they recognize them as coming back and she's identified as this naomi now verse 20 and naomi responded and is this naomi she said to them call me not naomi which that was beautiful or pleasant is what that name meant call me mara for the almighty and she's identifying god as being the one that has uh power and control over her and giving him uh the the liberty and the uh to to address her or to deal with her have dealt very bitterly with me so naomi which means beautiful pleasant she's saying my pleasantness has been turned to bitterness of soul don't call me naomi anymore that that evokes an image of somebody who's pleasant and somebody who is beautiful but i'm coming back bitter in soul because i've suffered great loss and she amplifies that in verse 22. uh excuse me for 21. i went out full i left with the husband and two sons that would would seem to be very wealthy for a woman and a family to have two sons and there's going to be this legacy that will be passed down i went out full and the lord notice she's talking about the lord the lord hath brought me home again md i left with a husband and two sons i come back with neither my husband nor my two sons i'm coming back empty and she's now i want you to this is something i want you to focus on she's recognizing the providence of god the almighty has dealt very bitterly with me see and she says so why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me she's recognizing the hand of god these things are by the hand of god if naomi could testify she could have said elimelech and i knew that we were disobeying god when we left we thought it would just be our first season but we've suffered greatly because of this so i'm coming back because god has judged me correctly he's testified against me he's afflicted me in our own disobedience and so she's recognizing the providence of god and it's him the lord notice this phrase the lord hath brought me home so it is the hand of god is the providence of god that is bringing her home and as she's bringing her home she's bringing ruth with her so i this is the connection we'd like to make the lord hath brought me home again but it's not just naomi it's ruth so if the lord's bringing naomi the lord's also bringing ruth and the next verse speaks to it verse 22 saying naomi returned and ruth the moabitess the lord hath brought naomi home again and the lord hath brought ruth the moabitess her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and this beautiful phrase that we're going to focus on some more tonight and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest and this is the phrase i'd like to amplify but as this is broken up into chapters and verses this verse 22 and this phrase they came to bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest this is the conclusion of this tremendous chapter which introduces the story of ruth so we read this love story we think of all the things that have been said about it more than just a love story but god reveals himself in this and it brings out something about the bride in the last days as this scene ruth begins with uh with disobedience and two three different funerals and and death begins and it comes upon this family as it's trying to come to this introduction of ruth this is probably this is the point that kind of seals in the scene it sets the scene the story's been told now we can begin to focus more particularly on the events that take place because from the moment that it begins in verse 1 there's a lot of years that are covered but now we're going to begin to cover events that transpire within a very short period of time and the scene has been set and this phrase they come to bethlehem at the beginning of the barley season is this climactic conclusion of this introductory chapter and it's from this point on that we can say the events in ruth begin to center around what the harvest the things that you begin to read in chapter two and chapter three and even in chapter four are are events that are surrounded by and taking place during the harvest time so that gets our attention we're living in the harvest time ruth being a type of the bride we would it's very uh i guess maybe apparent to us or obvious that if she represents the bride things that would be taking place in her life would transpire during the harvest time because that's when the bride comes on the scene is during the rapture time of the harvest time and the harvesting of barley is it's going to identify here that they came to bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest there were several phases or stages to the barley harvest there was a time in which they would cut things down and they'd be gathered into and they'd be put into these sheaves and they would be and there's omers and they would be placed together and so there's a cutting down of the barley then there's an actual gathering of the barley and then there's a um there's a place in it on the threshing floor and on the threshing floor it would be um crushed and it would separate uh it kind of break up that husk or that that that shuck and then that would be winnowed into the wind and it would blow away the shock and the barley would fall to the ground and this was kind of a process of of harvesting the barley there was phases and stages to this harvesting process and and it's uh i know that we've expressed this and you recognize this so i i don't want you to think well my brother aaron really thinks this is really profound um i'm just maybe saying it for my own benefit but the phrase the beginning of the barley harvest it's an important context to recognize that and focus on that in order to understand the type of ruth for us as we could say that orpah who represents the laodicean church represents that nominal believer that lukewarm church she is separated from ruth who represents the bride that has just happened in ruth chapter one by the end the end of chapter one and so now ruth is coming to uh to bethlehem jude at the time of the barley harvest and she's already kind of going through this process herself even in the story of ruth but then also for the bride as we can see that there's going to be a separation from the shock for the bride there's going to be a the bride is going to be made manifest this is now ruth that is brought forth in chapter two and the story is going to focus on her and unfold more particularly upon her and the message this day this scripture is fulfilled he says now we find out the condition of the world we see where the church normal he uses that phrase actually of orpah the church normal we might think well he's talking about nominal and yes the normal church the nominal church uh the church organization denomination we see where they are they are identified they have made themselves known they have they have identified that they want to go back to what they were they don't want to follow the word of the hour we see where they're where the nations are and we see that this day these promises is fulfilled now but in this this day there is to come a super royal seed of abraham so ruth is ruth is represents this grain this seed that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride to the royal promised son you know this this book is going to come to a union a marriage ruth is going to marry boaz and so here we see a royal seat of abraham we see the church world we see orpah we see the nominal world we see the luke 1 word we see the make-believer an unbeliever but there's to be a royal seed of abraham a royal bride to the royal promised son he says as i spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed he says there is to be a spiritual bride raise up if there's going to be a spiritual bride raise up there's got to be something to give rise to her got to be something that brings her forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride there's to be spiritual bride raise up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith of abraham's royal son there is to be a spiritual bride raise up she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is the promise that's given to her so this is what we see in ruth ruth comes on the scene and no one and i don't know how news necessarily traveled in those days i often marvel at how you're reading a story in the old testament and something takes place and they're able to get a message to someone very precisely at just the right time and so they had a way for things for messages to be conveyed i know sometimes for us we think man what would we do if we didn't have cell phones when we landed at the airport well we did it for decades and you just happen to find the person you're looking for you are able to convey the information you need to convey and so i don't know how information traveled then i wasn't there present to know but we don't know that there had been maybe much knowledge of what was taking place with naomi and elimelech so it wouldn't be that everyone's expecting ruth to show up not everyone's expecting oh wow we knew this would happen and we knew this is the way that it would be and we made everything ready but she comes on the scene and she's making her appearance in ruth chapter two which at the end of chapter one and into chapter two and it's a type of the spiritual bride that's raising up she has to come on the scene she is to come forth in the last days and the time and the place is her promise so there's a promised place for the bride to come to there is a promised time for the bride to come on the scene and in the book of ruth it's at the beginning of the barley harvest that ruth comes forth and it's at the harvest time that the bride comes forth the beginning of the barley harvest would have been in the early spring and that might seem a little bit counterintuitive to how we recognize our harvest times but there was a planting in the fall and the fall rains and then the beginning of the barley harvest would have been in the springtime there in israel and when the this phrase is used and i can't go into i can't even begin to scratch the surface as a matter of fact i wouldn't even try to imply that i'm skipping the surface let's just say i'm kind of pointing to the surface saying hey this is identifying a very very deep pool there's a lot of stuff here and using the phrase that she comes they come to bethlehem judah at the beginning this phrase the beginning the barley harvest immediately draws certain feast days into view that if this is the time that they're coming even though the scripture is silent about it it's kind of pointing to the season that ruth would be coming forth and in doing so i want to take just a few moments tonight and just point to the fact that this is the truth that's being highlighted and being emphasized if the lord would lead us to go deeper into it i know that i would certainly be excited about it but i don't pursue my own uh my own agenda and even the things that i want to study when it comes to the word of god you all have done a tremendous job in praying uh in such a way that burdens me and i know that's the direction i need to go and it's not the way i'm wanting to go i'm not throwing darts coming up with something i'm not playing divining by the bible and just flipping things open your prayers burdened the servant's heart and he and he goes by that burden and so if that would be the what lord would want to do we'll get into it but i want to just point to and i feel led to just point to these feasts point to this season and point to this time and begin to get us to think man there's a lot that's represented in these things that have this uh relevance to the story of ruth and the relevance to us as a bride and so these feasts that would come into view at the beginning of the barley harvest the feast of the passover would have been in the beginning of the year for them the first month being nissan which corresponds to our march or april but in the in the scripture in the 14th day of the sun they began they had the feast of the passover and we know that was instituted in the exodus that when the death angel was going to be passing through is egypt they had to apply the token upon the doorpost and the lintel they had to be in inside dressed a particular way and they had to draw a lamb without blemish of one year and they had to roast it and they had to serve it eat it and eat everything of it and they were eating the lamb and that's why it's called the paschal lamb or the passover lamb and as they were eating it the death angel went through egypt and smote everyone who did not have the token applied and god said this will be the beginning of months for you this is going to be a memorial to this is going to begin your calendar and that began their calendar he says this is a feast that you'll keep through all generations so it was instituted and it became a permanent feast for them and so this feast would have been celebrated about that this time that ruth is coming at the beginning of the barley harvest the feast of the passover is celebrated in that time and then the on the 14th day of the sun they would have the feast of the passover then the very next day on the 15th of the sun they would have the feast of unleavened bread and it would begin that day that sabbath would begin the feast of unleavened bread and that would be kept for seven days for seven days they would eat unleavened bread we find that also in the exodus they were to get all the yeast out of their homes and purge themselves of all the east and for seven days they would eat unleavened bread so this is instituted in their feast you have the feast of the passover then you have this feast of unleavened bread that comes next and they would observe that on the 15th and then the day after after the as it would and i don't want to get maybe into the all the different ways that these the calendar could fall but in the in the way that it was designed and celebrated you have on the 14th the feast of the passover the 15th of nisan you'd have the the feast of unleavened bread and then the day after that after that sabbath day they would have the feast of the first fruits and what they would do is the first grain that is harvested would be brought to the temple and offered on the altar on the sunday after that sabbath of the feast of the unleavened bread so you'd have a feast of the passover feast of unleavened bread and then on the sunday you'd have they would come and they would offer the first grain bring it into the temple it'd be offered and they'd make this offering on that we call it sunday but it would they would call it the day after the sabbath or the first day of the week the day after the sabbath they would make the offering of this first fruits or it'd be the feast of the first fruits so these are all these these spring feasts that we hear about and ruth is coming to bethlehem judah at this time at this time when these feasts are taking place or maybe even having just transpired that's what caught that's the time that ruth shows up now let's just read through leviticus chapter 23 verses 4 to 12 and i'd like just to read it so you can see how the scriptures lay out the timing of these feasts and even the language that's used of it because in his message believers you'll immediately begin to identify that wow there are some types that are in their feast that mean something to us as gentile brain now remember as gentile bride we do not celebrate the feast nor are we bound by the feet the calendar of the feast but they're they represent types to us and sometimes they represent types on varying levels various levels to where we don't just try to make this calendar very very rigid and very very strict where on the day of pentecost uh when it had fully come the holy ghost was poured out and then we try to make all the feast work i mean by strict calendar from that moment on when the church was instituted well what feast was next and when was the trumpets and when were the tabernacles and and all these feasts to try to make them fit as a real rigid structure that god has to stay within for the bride that's not exactly how god deals with the gentiles but that is the calendar that god had given israel and there's types contained in them and that's what brother branham would do is he would identify the type but not do it in such a way that we try to constrain ourselves to certain uh numerics because actually sometimes when we do that we try to restrain ourselves to certain numerics we say oh no it can't be this it can't be this it can't be this because of numerology and you actually find that what you do is you actually cut yourself out of the promise he said no it has to be this it has to be that and god works in different ways and you go by truth and then the numerology lines up with it you don't just start with the number then try to find the truth same thing with the type find the truth then you see the type don't start with the type and try to pigeonhole a truth into it so leviticus chapter 23 verses 4 to 12. these are the feasts of the lord this is actually being announced to them and laid out to them here in leviticus even holy convocations which ye shall proclaim in their seasons so there's a time and a place for these feasts in the 14th day of the first month that even is the lord's passover so the 14th day of the first month that even is the lord's passover and on the 15th day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the lord so you can see one begins on the 14th the other one takes place on the 15th the lord's passover feast of the passover feast of unleavened bread on the next day and then in the first day in seven days you must eat unleavened bread so this begins the feast of unleavened bread in its seven day process in the first day you shall have a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord seven days in the seventh day is a holy convocation ye shall do no servile work therein and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them so this is uh that that's the feast of passover the feast of unleavened bread he says now and you can see that the the numbers there that they're lining up on the 14th and 15th and then kicking off those seven days and verse 10 speak unto the children of israel and send to them when you become into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof so this would have been a future feast since they weren't planting crops and harvesting there in the wilderness now he's instituting this feast that will come when they're placed in their promised land you shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall waive it so you have the friday feast of passover or the 14th feast of passover 15th which would have been a shabbat or the sabbath that saturday they'd had the feast of unleavened bread and then tomorrow after the first day of the week or what we would call sunday they are to take a take the reap of the harvest and shall bring gnosis the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the lord to be accepted by you so this is the wave sheath taking place on that sunday or on that day on the morrow after it says here on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it and ye shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf a he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the lord and notice just how beautiful those symbolisms would be on the day that there's actually going to be a wave sheath of the first fruits of this harvest they're actually going to sacrifice an innocent lamb without blemish as a burnt offering and then you see these symbolisms that do what they represent jesus christ because you are you're bible students you're christians you you could you catch these things and probably already been thinking about them as we leaned into this in christ's first coming his death and resurrection unfold around these feasts could what what feast were they keeping in the night that he dipped the sop and they gathered together and they had their feast it was the feast of the passover and it was during that time that they're having this feast and there's uh there's a lot more details to it and how trans begin in the evening and continue all the way on to another evening and we're not going to get into the details of that at least i'm resisting the urge to do so uh but i want to just kind of focus on the fact that we realize in the scripture that these these events in the crucifixion of jesus and his resurrection are taken around this happening during this time period and so these things transpiring during this time period we see christ participating in the feast of the passover we see that he is crucified and he is buried and then they would have been having the feast of unleavened bread and then on that sunday catch this on that day after the morrow on that first day of the week for them which would have been sunday which we call that what resurrection day on that day that he's resurrected at the very time that they are going to be doing this wave of the first fruits christ resurrects from the grave on the first day of the week and he's resurrected on the very day that they're offering the first fruits in the harvest and that's why paul writes in first corinthians 15 20 but now is christ risen from the dead and notice the language he uses and become the first fruits of them that slept the first fruits of them that were planted in death now christ is raised and not just on any day he's raised on the day of the feast of the first fruits and they're there doing this offering and this waving of the first fruits there in the temple and the priests are offering this this this wave offering while they sacrifice this lamb and so here christ paul recognizes that christ comes fulfilling that type and christ is the first fruits he's using a phrase that's connected with the old testament feast christ is the first fruits of the resurrection the firstborn among many brethren he's the proof he's the evidence that of eternal life he's the he is actually now fulfilling these great types and these feasts and so this is how christ's ministry is cl is kept in the climax of his ministry and then it would have been seven sabbaths or 50 days from that time that you have what the feast of pentecost and when the day of pentecost has fully come then the holy spirit is poured out in the church's birth and you can see all these different things that begin to line up at this time and so this is christ climax and capstone of his ministry it happened in the feast of the passover the feast of unleavened bread his resurrection on the time of the feast of the firstfruits and that would have been at the beginning of the barley harvest and so it's no coincidence that ruth would come to bethlehem judah at this very time and at this very place that she would come to bethlehem the very place that this bread of life was to be born the very place where this lamb without slaughter blemish was born and would be born a baby born to die to be offered as a sacrifice she comes to the place of his birth at the very time in the very season in the uh that he was uh walking through that place of dying out for whose sake our sake for the bride's sake so it's no coincidence she comes on the scene at that time into that place brother branham in the message god's only provided place of worship there was a very lengthy statement i was looking at to read but then i thought well i'd like to read a little bit more from the message it is the rising of the sun so i've tapered this this reading down a little bit and he's making the connection of the seven days of of eating no leaven or having unleavened bread for seven days and kind of making it the connection to the seven church ages and the climax that transpires in at the end of those seven church ages so he's talking about seven days and he's reading from the exodus the seven days seven days with no eleven and he's making the connection back to with the church ages and he makes this statement as he reads in the scripture and there shall be no leavened bread seen in thee in all thy coast seven days and he says the sacrifice here is a type the bride coming forth from the sacrifice which is christ so what's what what's being represented at the time of the feast of passover and the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the first fruits is not just christ fulfilling th this great work in this first pla you know just dying as a sacrifice but he's doing it as the first step and the first stage of redemption and that your your sins are atoned for in that and it represents you and you're in there and so he makes the connection the sacrifice is a type and he said uses the phrase the bride coming forth so because of the sacrifice the bride comes forth and then he continues in the scripture neither shall there be anything of it the flesh which thou sacrificed the first day at even so the bride coming forth from the sacrifice which is christ he says and remember how we just went through the church ages the messenger to the church always comes just at the dying of the other church age always this is a very important phrase the dying of pentecost brings forth the rapturing of the bride now the dying of pentecost refers specifically to the laodicean church age which brother ben called the pentecostal age and it's representative that that move that organized genuine move of god that that begins at the beginning of the laodicean church age that organizes and what they die out so it's within the laodicean church age that you have this last order of the reformation that they fall away from very quickly 10 to 15 years they've all already fallen away from it and they've organized and that's why there had to come a prophet who would bring a restoration of even that pentecostal move that had been lost so when brother brahm says the dying of pentecost brings forth the rapturing bride that is not a death of the pentecostal experience which the pentecostal experience is to be born again by the baptism of the holy ghost it's not a death of a promise that was given to the church but it relates specifically to this dispensation and the nominal church the pentecostal age the laodicean church age that descends in absolute chaos and complete darkness but as that dies out what does it bring forth the rapturing of the bride so as the laodicean age descends in the chaos and as they go down into darkness and blackness and god draws it out to there's absolutely no light it's a complete blackout of the church and it's really really dark at the very time that that's happened and there's gross darkness of the people that he raises up something and there's a man here who can turn on the light and it brings forth what a rapturing bride a bride comes forth she comes on the scene in the last day she's the one that begins to rise up the diner luther brought forth wesley the dying of wesley brought forth pentecost the dying of pentecost brings forth the message now as that dies a message comes forth what is the shout it's the message it's a messenger it's the living bread of life a shout bringing forth the bride the dying of pentecost brings forth the message now here it's right here patterned all through the scripture there's not a scripture in the bible but what hooks write one with the other all these types and we see the type in the book of ruth at the end of chapter 1 ruth comes to bethlehem judah at the beginning of the barley harvest why it's harvest time there's something that's transpiring this time it's christ many years later who it would come from her very lineage boaz and obed and jesse and and david and the very lineage christ the messiah comes and then he is going to be fulfilling all these tremendous types that ruth just steps right into the drama that foreshadows it here's the bride in type a gentile woman stepping into bethlehem judah at the harvest time and laid many many years later christ is going to be born in bethlehem what is it representing it's foreshadowing that christ the word brings forth the bride abraham uses very same language and it is the rising of the sun i know this is a very lengthy uh statement that we're reading to you and if it helps you just to persevere through it i'm i think i'm really going to finish super early tonight and uh i'm just maybe saying that as a positive confession and it is the rising of this if i go longer than what i'm thinking i think it's super early i guess it's kind of ambiguous i'll just blame it all on you you just pull too good he says it was the first corn of god's wheat that had been raised from the dead god's first corn of wheat how about christ by god's quickening power god had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheaf what did we find in leviticus chapter 23 that there is a wave sheep which is the first fruits now there's a subsequent wave of offering that takes place again and you can see the types of that how 50 days later there was another loaves two loaves that are waved over the people and these things are done again so there's going to be another wave sheath so if you look at christ as being the first fruits in leviticus 23 as the one who is waved as the first fruits there's still another wave that comes and he says that's why they had to wave that sheath for it was the first one that come to maturity and it was waved as a memorial thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign and today because he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and is waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been typed and many times as we'll see later that he was type but this was really the first fruit of them that slept he was waived over the promised seed that had promise of life he was waived at the day of pentecost he says when there would come a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people is up at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come so this is him identifying how that christ even on the first the the feast of the first fruits there was a wave offering 50 days later there was another offering that would have been made on the feast of pentecost two loaves waived by the priest and so you can see how brother branham is even saying even on the day of pentecost we could see this type of the wave sheath over the people christ is waved he's the for god's first corn of wheat the first fruits of them that's left slept he was waived at the day of pentecost so who is the wave sheath christ he's the wave sheep and then he says catch this and to be waved again we realize in the last day according to luke 17 30. now this is a prophet showing us again not that we try to stick to this real rigid counter say oh okay well then if he was waved again on pentecost let's try to make all the dates fit again so what's what's seven sabbaths seven church ages since the day of pentecost what feast are we in you're gonna find you're in the middle of nowhere and well this doesn't fit where does this work i don't know what's going on here no i mean don't try to just you don't take the type that oh we're in the exodus and we cross the red sea and so once we've crossed the red sea uh here we are and then once we cross the jordan river here and you try to just take the story of the axis and type it all the way out until you get the end of the book of malachi you're not going to fight you're not going to be able to follow that all the way through so you take the you see the truth and you see these types that sometimes multiple ways that they can apply so now we realize it's going to be waved again according to luke 17 30. we've been looking at this very scripture through several of these services because how the parallel of the days of lot and the day when the son of man is revealed and he reveals himself to abraham and his group and there's sarah which represents the bride and all these promises given to sarah and all these types of lot and his two daughters and their connection to moab which was came from lot with one of his daughters and how you see ruth the moabitus and what's going to change her from being a moabite it's going to be boaz it's going to be the kinsmen redeemer it's going to be this christ figure it's going to be the messiah so there's going to be another wave sheep according to luke 17 30 it is the revealing of the son of man that brings forth the bride this connection of the feast days to this and the very time that ruth is coming to bethlehem judah and now brother brown connects luke 17 32 it says in the day the son of man he says again in the day that the s-o-n of man will be revealed or waived again over the people so it's not a son of man that's waved it's christ the word he's waved over the people now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of god by word of god buy signs by wonders we see today that in the book of luke the 17th chapter the 30th verse and malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waived over the people this is what's happening at the very time that ruth comes to bethlehem judah that the feast of leviticus 23 the feast of passover the feast of unleavened bread the feast of the first fruits where there's a wave offering over the people these are the things that are transpiring in the time that ruth comes to bethlehem judah and so it's no coincidence that she does that because when brother brown's identified the bride coming on the scenes in the last days he said there's another wave chief there's a wave chief the word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead just like ruth's first husband was and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and is this phrase is important giving us life so the revelation of the son of man is life-giving it's what quickens the bride quickening power snatches us from death to life as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept you familiar with this phrase in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheaf wave again in the last days regardless of where you want to put the comma here it's all saying the same thing in the bride coming of christ the coming of christ unto the bride or the bride coming of christ however you look at it it's all the same thing in the bride the coming of christ as she comes out of the church as she separates from orpah as she comes into the promised land as she comes into her harvest time as she comes to bethlehem judah there's a wave sheep that's being offered why because it's time for ruth to be married to boaz it's time for the reveal of the son of man it's time for the bride to be united with their head it's time for the marriage so there will be in the bride coming of christ there'll be a sheath waved again in the last days and that brings forth the bride for her union waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time they'll come forth for the bride age it's a phrase he doesn't use very often but he uses it i think eight times just in the last few months of his ministry for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism there's got to be a resurrection she comes to the uh to bethlehem judah at the time of the barley harvest the feast of the first fruits the sign of a resurrection bypassing death life has come forth this is a harvest this is a tremendous time they'll come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationism will be a message what is the message it's the shout what is the shout it's christ the living bread of life bringing forth the bride that the full maturity of the word has returned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there that's fantastic that's beautiful this is the time that we're living in these are truths that we desire that god would make alive just by revelation and to fully understand these events are transpiring let's not live in a someday mentality all this is going to happen someday this is going to happen sunday if there's going to be if there's going to be something that happens someday that's going to happen but if you're ever going to make it to someday you got to recognize what god's done in this day and you've got to have a full revelation of this day to make it to someday so if there's some day promise that's coming we still got to recognize the promise for this day because he's got to give us a word for this day to get us to someday and if you want to make it to the millennial day you've got to recognize this day in its message if you want to be there at the meeting in the air you've got to catch the revelation of christ here on earth today if you want to be with him one day when he returns back to earth in a corporal body and sets his feet on earth in that coming of jesus christ which all believers believe in and you want to be a part of that coming then you've got to recognize the reveal of the son of that man in this state that you're living in for all believers in every age who are going to be a part of that great coming back in return of the bride to the earth as christ comes the third time with his bride you have to have caught the word for your day to be a part of that descending and so these things are a part of us recognizing who we are and ruth and this is the grace that we could give to a lot of people ruth had no idea who she was when she showed up that day she showed up at the beginning of the barley harvest and she'd say now naomi i don't know if you recognize this you know kind of poor naomi you know you don't realize this but let me tell you something i'm coming back as a gentile i'm a moabite but i'm coming back on the very time some speculate that she shows up after they are coming back from this wave offering this offering of the first fruits and she's coming back at this very time and everyone sees her after they've just seen this great drama portrayed the sacrifice of a lamb the waving of the first fruits and all sudden a gentile woman shows up that's going to marry boaz and comes on the scene right up because there's no way you ever get to a gentile bride unless the lamb is slain and he's resurrected and he sends his spirit back and ruth is showing up right at that very time and ruth just said i don't know if you caught this if you're spiritual you'll cop this i'm a gentile there's going to be a messiah who's going to have all these gentile women in her lineage i'm going to be one of them and i'm going to marry a man who's going to be in that line and i'm going to be part of this great the messiah that's going to come forth and he's going to be sacrificed at the time of the feast of the passover and the feast of unleavened bread he's going to be resurrected on this very time the feast of the first fruits and they're all coming back and they're like whoa what's going on and hey here i am where's my bow as maybe she wouldn't have known it was a boaz but she was she was looking for her bridegroom i'm going to i want to get married because i know this has got to happen she didn't know i i neither did we really right we let me just think about how much we've enjoyed in the message of the hour how much has been revealed to us think back of all the uh let me just maybe by show of hand how many of you have been feeding on this word of god for more than 30 years show your hands it's okay look at this more than a dozen of you jack you're not quite 30 yet been feeding on this word of god for over 30 years and when you begin to feed on it you loved it it was life to you you rejoiced in it and it was unfolding and it's led you and guide you then you're here today go i had no idea at the time really how beautiful and full it would be today and it's unfolded for you and it's grown and it's gotten deeper and richer and there's a point at which many of us realize wait a minute whoa this is what this is it's more than god's sin of prophet it's more than one day there's going to be this and one day there's going to be that this is the fulfilling of the word of god in the last days he made a promise that he would do this he made a promise he would reveal himself and this is it this is the time the rapture's on and i'm living in that time i'm living in that season oh and ruth didn't know it that day and maybe we don't fully understand it but what my prayer is oh god help us to see help us to recognize help us to walk in every step in every face help us to trust maybe even more that ruth did that no matter what circumstances no matter how much loss we've suffered no matter how much pain we're feeling there is a field to boaz there is a provision there is a ministry there are keepers and there is a lord of the harvest that will see you through to the end that he will care for you he will provide for you he'll give you all the things that you have need of even if we can't recognize where we fit in that maybe we could just say at this very moment if we could have talked to ruth we knew what was happening and why naomi was over there going oh call me maura call me maura we could come by and we would just we can't give the story away but just say something say roof i know it may seem really really unlikely you know maybe you don't feel like much but it doesn't matter that you're a moabite there's a promise for you just stay faithful there's a promise for you don't worry you don't fret there's a promise we could do that we might be all excited and try to tell the whole story you're not going to believe this but you're going to go out you're going to start gleaning you want to tell the whole story but you can just be encouraged today god's got your back he's going to take care of you and it's ruth coming on the scene at the beginning of the barley harvest and what was it that we read in the scripture that caused naomi to return it said that she had heard that the lord had visited his people and giving them bread so when she shows up it's the beginning of the barley harvest what could we call that vindication that's vindication that the lord had visited his people and giving them bread if she showed up and there was no barley harvest then your question is i thought i heard that the lord had visited his people and given him bread but she shows up and the very harvest of that barley is the proof that the lord himself had visited bethlehem judah and was giving them bread brother abraham says in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed and brother mike if you could come to the piano we'll close on this statement and christ is the mystery god revealed he said his body was not held in the grave because on that day after tomorrow the day after that sabbath at the very time that they're going to be offering the feast of the first fruits he ra he rose in that resurrection his body was not held in the grave recognized with him in the resurrection same as he has now listened which means this so now we are recognized in the resurrection right that's kind of the language he's using here and i know maybe the way i cut it off it may seem a little clunky but now we are recognized with him in the resurrection we are the same as he is now and he says which means this his word which he is has begun to be risen the word which he is has begun to be risen and what does he say in this message she is risen so the word which he is is a she and she has begun to be risen why because she's to come on the scenes in the last scene in the last day the living bread of life giving rise to the bride he says the word that came down through the age of luther wesley see has began to raise up to its power there it begin to move the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord then it moved a little more and now it's coming up to identification i remember how we read a moment ago how we said that the life it's proof that the life is coming in and giving life uh to the body and this like trying to find just exactly how he says it he says it's coming giving life this and it is giving us life is the phrase he says it's coming up to the identification now to the life in the body now that life is coming to the body through the head he says it's a vindication is a vindication of the rapture is at hand it's vindication that the lord has visited his people and giving them bread it's harvest time christ is a mystery god revealed what he's teaching this sermon is it is rapture time when you see the capstone uniting with the body he's declaring that now is the time of the harvest now is the rapture time now that you see the headstone revealing himself now that you see the capstone coming to the body it's the vindication the headship of the church is the vindication that the rapture is at hand when you see the headship in the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about to be received to the headship he has begun to give life unto his body the one that he has redeemed this is a heavy statement the mediatorial work is done he's bringing his life to body into vindication for the rapture he's bringing life to his bride the living bread of life the life giver that life messenger the revealing of the son of man quickening power let's see is coming quickening power opened up those seals quickening power snatched us from death to life being made alive what a resurrection this is life coming to the body he's bringing his life to the body in a vindication for the rapture proving that the lord has visited his people and giving them bread vindication now let me just say this i i want to just throw this disclaimer in there a lot of people can take this phrase the mediatorial work is done and try to slam this period down and says oh that means there's no mercy then if that's so we're playing church we're just we're in the tribulation time just pretending but there's a lot of people who've taken these things and made them into something they're not so don't don't make the same mistake but he's identifying a special dispensation fullness life headship body vindication for the rapture and that's just pointing to the deep waters not even skimming the surface not even scratching the surface that's just saying this is what's meant this is what's underneath the phrase that roof came to bethlehem judah at the beginning of the barley harvest i know we're a lot further in the journey of ruth ourselves personally even as a as believers today the revelation you have of this message is much further than what it would have been for ruth even if she arrived on the morrow after the feast of unleavened bread and she's there in bethlehem jude at the time of the feast of the first fruits we've advanced further than maybe this specific instance in ruth's life wouldn't it beautiful just to revisit the things that god's done for you to see yourself in the book of ruth we are at harvest time church so our minds are on the rapture that's our goal let's stand tonight together [Music] oh how beautiful it is to serve him in the rapture time rapture season what excitement anticipation it can begin to build for us to think that there's a a promise that we're living under now that speaks of translation that speaks of change that we have received power to bind death that's the power that's present that's resonant within us now that's that's the direction that we're headed then i can believe for all things you you can believe for all things tonight our gracious heavenly father thank you for your presence that's been amongst us this evening thank you for the many lord that are here tonight that have gathered together in anticipation of hearing your word and with the desire to participate in worship and lord as we've delivered a very succinct and very narrow thought tonight of the time that ruth came to bethlehem judah and how it was at the beginning of the barley harvest i'm just mentioning lord by way of observation how that it would have been a time of the feast of the passover and the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the first fruits and then to see how christ is interacting with these very same feasts and bringing forth the actual substance of what those things foreshadowed he's not the type he's the substance of what those things foreshadowed and he comes on the scene he comes to the feast he's sacrificed as a lamb his body is broken and his blood is shed and then he rises on that first day of the week tomorrow after the feast of unleavened bread [Music] it is the first fruits of them that slept and when god raised christ from the dead we were raised with him and we're identified with that lord we're taught that the body follows the head and we're thankful in this hour that we have received the headship of the word and lord i know that that could sound like some really awesome ear tickling message theology but lord it's not academia it's not history it's not types and shadows it's a revelation that gives us bread that we need for monday mornings it's a revelation that gives us strength we need for thursday evenings lord it's a revelation that helps us to be the men that we ought to be the ladies that we are the husbands and wives that we desire to be the mentors and the leaders and uh the parents to our children and the brother and sister that we ought to be to one another the the man of integrity that we ought to be within our community the the one that's a a a benefit to society lord these things are so much beyond head knowledge and theology lord it's real doctrine for the soul to make us the overcomers that we so crave to be lord it's my desire that as we see ourselves in the book of ruth it would help us to see you and what you are to us in this story so it brings us real close to you bless us tonight lord we pray for sister esther that you'd bring her a complete total deliverance for brother ryan may you heal his shoulder at this very moment give him strength for this academy for sister sandy lord we're not just discouraged by any report none whatsoever you are in control we give you the glory we pray that you continue to touch her and uphold her with such strength lord in character shoulders are back her chin is up and lord i pray that you would touch her and continue to heal her give strength to brother victor lord as well and her family members to support her and lord we pray for the different ones undergoing difficulties and challenges and battles lord you know your sons and daughters that sit and drive places and going through difficult things may you come to their aid may their advocates speak on their behalf not so much before the throne but in the throne of their hearts to encourage them [Music] let them know that there's a body here arizona believers church that loves them that's family to them that's mindful of them that's praying for them that's here for them [Music] lord i failed to mention it at the beginning but yesterday i visited my grandma who turned 99 years old and it was precious she wanted to know how the church was doing she had questions in her heart about the people and how it was going and i was so moved by her interest and her compassion lord i pray that you bless her with strength lord and continued long life lord i pray for those that are unable to be here tonight may you strengthen them encourage them and bless us father as we're dismissed we commit these things to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord praise
