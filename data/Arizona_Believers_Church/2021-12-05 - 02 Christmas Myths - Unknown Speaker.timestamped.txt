[0:01] matthew chapter one i'm read verse 23.
[0:04] i'm gonna
[0:06] just jump right on into
[0:09] the message this morning
[0:11] beginning with matthew chapter 1 verse
[0:13] 23 is our text
[0:16] we mentioned it wednesday night and i
[0:18] will say now and i may mention it
[0:22] again this morning is that i'm wanting
[0:24] to begin a series of services i think
[0:26] it's going to be seven in total
[0:29] on um
[0:31] on christmas the subject of christmas
[0:33] and beginning with chris myths christmas
[0:36] myths
[0:37] and um
[0:39] and i think that if as we begin to
[0:41] explore this subject and
[0:44] there could be some tensing up for some
[0:45] people like oh great here we go seven
[0:47] services on christmas where's this going
[0:49] i think listening to wednesday night
[0:51] sermon would be
[0:53] not mandatory reading it's not
[0:54] compulsory anything that's a mandate
[0:57] these days it gets us a little bit
[0:58] nervous but i think it would be
[0:59] advisable good to listen to that part um
[1:02] so that it kind of provides part of this
[1:05] foundation
[1:06] um for where we're wanting to go with
[1:08] this
[1:08] and i'm probably not going to end up
[1:10] where a lot of you think i am but i will
[1:12] probably touch a lot of spots that you
[1:14] think i would but there's just a
[1:16] beautiful truth that god is really
[1:18] emphasizing and highlighting to me this
[1:20] year and i want to bring it out to you
[1:22] by his grace and so matthew chapter 1
[1:25] verse 23 i'm reading this and then it's
[1:27] gonna
[1:28] um
[1:29] i want to use it in contrast to another
[1:31] scripture here in a little bit but i
[1:33] thought this would be a good one to use
[1:34] as our text behold a virgin shall be
[1:36] with child and shall bring forth a son
[1:39] and they shall call his name emmanuel
[1:42] which being interpreted is
[1:44] god
[1:45] with us
[1:46] amen let's just pray for a moment our
[1:48] gracious heavenly father as we have read
[1:50] from your word
[1:52] uh words that were pinned by the breath
[1:54] of god we pray that you would
[1:57] help us to stay within the framework of
[1:58] your scripture
[2:00] that in everything that we would say and
[2:02] preach this morning it would be in
[2:03] harmony with the spirit
[2:05] of the message of the hour
[2:07] and that we would in all things glorify
[2:10] you
[2:11] that we would not give any
[2:13] a preference to our opinions that we
[2:15] would not cater to pressure
[2:17] but lord labor to lift up the right
[2:19] thing so that in doing so
[2:22] your believers grow into a greater
[2:24] relationship with you
[2:26] and father i commit this service to you
[2:27] just desiring that if there be any
[2:29] uneasiness or
[2:31] nervousness in the people it would be
[2:32] dispelled as our desire is to purely
[2:35] lift you up so may you have preeminence
[2:37] we pray bless the word which we have
[2:39] just read the scriptures and the
[2:41] quotations that will be shared today
[2:43] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[2:44] pray amen
[2:46] and you can be seated
[2:48] it's we're
[2:50] on the subject of christmas and um our
[2:52] title is part two of christmas myths
[2:55] we mentioned even on wednesday night how
[2:57] that christmas and the celebrating of
[3:00] christmas and even a lot of the elements
[3:02] related to christmas can be
[3:03] controversial
[3:04] not just to the the outside uh or the
[3:08] atheist or the agnostic
[3:10] uh but it's controversial with within
[3:12] christianity itself amongst those who
[3:14] believe that jesus christ was the son of
[3:16] god born into the world of a virgin
[3:19] people who believe in the fulfillment of
[3:21] this very scripture
[3:23] uh referring to the prophecy in isaiah
[3:25] that a virgin shall be with child and
[3:27] this the angel lord expressing this to
[3:30] joseph that mary is with child of the
[3:33] holy ghost and she's going to bring
[3:34] forth that one whose name shall be
[3:36] emmanuel
[3:38] for those that believe in the very
[3:39] fulfillment of this so we believe
[3:41] christianity all of christendom believes
[3:44] that jesus christ was born into the
[3:46] world but yet the subject of christmas
[3:48] or the holiday christmas is
[3:50] controversial even amongst those that
[3:52] believe the very fulfillment of these
[3:54] scriptures and not only is it
[3:55] controversial within
[3:57] uh christianity or nominal christianity
[3:59] it's also
[4:01] uh kind of a sticky subject within
[4:03] society at large especially as it
[4:05] relates to the celebration and where you
[4:07] hear a lot of it is over the last many
[4:09] decades is how that christmas is a
[4:12] religious holiday and it needs to be
[4:14] separated out from government he needs
[4:16] to be separated out from being in our
[4:18] schools and so there's a lot of
[4:19] controversy even with society as secular
[4:22] people or non-believing people would
[4:23] feel that these things impose upon
[4:27] religious freedom
[4:28] and if you
[4:29] drill down into any one of the
[4:31] controversies whether it be within
[4:32] christianity or whether it be within
[4:34] society or within government or politics
[4:37] christmas is controversial largely due
[4:39] to its truth
[4:41] there's a lot of people that in society
[4:43] at large that are resistant to
[4:45] christianity uh for the on the basis
[4:48] that this is this is true it's true that
[4:50] jesus christ
[4:51] is the son of god who was born into the
[4:53] world at some point in time and was
[4:55] brought forth according to scripture and
[4:57] so it's truth
[4:59] is the stigma it's truth is the
[5:01] the um
[5:03] the sticky point it's the truth that
[5:05] causes people to oppose it and not to
[5:06] like it but it's not just it's truth but
[5:09] it's also controversial because of its
[5:11] myths and that's the part i'm wanting to
[5:13] focus on as well as not only the truth
[5:15] but the myth of it because there's a lot
[5:17] of things that people oppose and there's
[5:19] a lot of things that people accept and
[5:21] they think they're accepting truth or
[5:23] they think they're opposing error but at
[5:25] the end of the day it's just a bunch of
[5:26] myths
[5:27] the only thing that's gotten them riled
[5:28] up but the only thing that they're doing
[5:30] and celebrating the only thing that
[5:31] they're lifting up and participating in
[5:33] is mythology
[5:34] and the
[5:36] uh maybe this uh
[5:38] speaks to a lot of the things that are
[5:39] in my heart the myths contribute to
[5:42] the controversy
[5:43] by creating scarecrows
[5:46] that there's maybe there's something
[5:47] there's some kernel of truth but then
[5:50] myths begin to pop up all around it and
[5:52] it becomes a scarecrow to the truth it
[5:54] uh they they contribute to the
[5:56] controversy by uh stigmatizing certain
[5:59] things or certain practices or certain
[6:01] beliefs or certain times of year there's
[6:03] a myth will actually stigmatize and so
[6:06] you do something and say oh well you
[6:08] know that's this or you know it's that
[6:09] and it's these myths that are associated
[6:11] with it that allow people to color
[6:13] something is right or wrong but in
[6:15] reality it's just a myth that's behind
[6:17] it
[6:18] and then we talked about it on wednesday
[6:20] night
[6:21] and um and i think maybe it would be
[6:22] good just to touch on a couple points
[6:24] from that surface
[6:26] on how the the radicalization myth is
[6:30] where you may believe something very
[6:32] ardently and and we have basis to
[6:35] believe certain things in the scripture
[6:36] but what the critic would want to do is
[6:38] make us feel as if we become radicals
[6:41] and we become extreme and that whoa that
[6:43] is too far and that's fanaticism and the
[6:46] purpose of kind of putting that scarlet
[6:48] letter on you as a radical is to cause
[6:50] you to no longer do what you're doing
[6:53] and so sometimes people experience some
[6:55] sort of conviction or conflict in their
[6:57] hearts because you're doing something a
[6:59] particular way and they start feeling
[7:01] the conflict and they way that they
[7:02] resolve this is like well you're too
[7:04] legalistic or you're just radical or
[7:06] you're just too extreme and they're
[7:08] doing that and saying that kind of
[7:09] putting this label on you hoping that
[7:11] you abandon the practice
[7:14] or start doing something else to kind of
[7:16] relieve themselves of the guilt that
[7:17] they're feeling so there's a there's
[7:19] stigma there's a scarecrow there's even
[7:21] a label that people try to put on on us
[7:24] or upon others or that we can put on
[7:26] people to try to sterilize their faith
[7:29] and we need to be aware of polarization
[7:32] in any subject matter and even with
[7:34] respect to truths that
[7:36] the word of god is to draw us to christ
[7:40] paul dealt with this uh polarization
[7:42] within the corinthian church how i'm of
[7:43] this man and i am of that man and and
[7:46] what was happening is people are being
[7:47] polarized to personalities and he's
[7:49] saying listen we are to be polarized but
[7:52] to christ
[7:53] and if in our grouping or our cliques or
[7:56] our rallying is not around christ but
[7:59] it's to personality or politics or some
[8:01] sort of um
[8:03] propaganda then we got to be careful
[8:06] realize no this i'm being polarized i'm
[8:08] being drawn to something i'm being a
[8:09] very ardent disciple of something that
[8:12] is actually not christ or in the word
[8:15] and so we need to be aware of
[8:16] polarization and i think it's good for
[8:19] us to at times maybe at all times be
[8:21] honest about things that are our
[8:24] personal dogma
[8:26] as long as it's in the word of god we
[8:27] can say that's god's dogma that's the
[8:29] dogma we follow if god is dogmatic i
[8:31] want to be dogmatic but what i don't
[8:33] want to do is allow dogma my personal
[8:36] dogma to become doctrine and my personal
[8:40] discipline and my personal beliefs and
[8:41] my personal convictions that aren't
[8:44] rooted in the word of god that aren't
[8:46] broadly shared you know laid out in the
[8:48] word of god i don't want certain things
[8:50] that may just be the way i do things i
[8:52] think the example i used maybe on
[8:53] wednesday night is uh there are some
[8:56] christians that believe or that to
[8:59] ingest caffeine is a sin
[9:01] and and they have basis for it and
[9:03] they'll even use scriptures and there's
[9:05] a maybe a rich theology that's related
[9:06] to it i've never actually
[9:08] studied it maybe that's a new series for
[9:10] the new year um the caffeine myth
[9:13] but the um
[9:14] you pick something like that and where
[9:16] it where it begins to get uh
[9:19] controversial is when someone has a
[9:21] conviction or discipline and in a way of
[9:24] justifying it they try to make it the
[9:26] word of god so that if anyone drinks
[9:28] caffeine you're sinning against god how
[9:30] could you be a christian because you
[9:31] drink caffeine and that's where the
[9:33] divide begins to happen
[9:35] and then because of the divide and
[9:37] defensiveness people not only from dogma
[9:40] does it become doctrine but then you get
[9:42] defensive and then what happens people
[9:43] get further and further away and more
[9:45] and more entrenched and then you have
[9:47] extreme that's where you have your
[9:48] radicalization
[9:50] so what you want to be is balanced and
[9:53] that's what we emphasized and wanted to
[9:54] lift up
[9:55] wednesday night is we need to become
[9:57] balanced by the word
[9:59] and by balance we need to realize that
[10:02] god is in the god is in the middle of
[10:04] the road as brother branham referred to
[10:05] it want to stay right in the middle of
[10:06] the word we want to stay in the middle
[10:07] of the road and the extremes are the
[10:10] ruts on each side of the middle of the
[10:12] road there's a rut on one side there's a
[10:14] red on the left side if you want to use
[10:15] uh left and right um to describe um the
[10:19] extremes and say well that's the
[10:21] political spectrum absolutely i don't
[10:23] mind at all if you want to think of it
[10:24] that way because really to get caught up
[10:26] in either side is a rut
[10:29] become entangled in politics and
[10:30] partisan things it's a very very tricky
[10:33] thing we to stay clean from that so the
[10:35] extremes form the ruts on each side of
[10:37] the way of truth there's a way of
[10:38] righteousness is the way of truth
[10:40] there's a path that the righteous must
[10:42] be walking in and there's going to be
[10:43] ditches on each side of that way in the
[10:46] ditch on one side of the ditch you could
[10:47] deny truth
[10:49] on the other side of the ditch you can
[10:51] distort truth
[10:52] and so there's dangers in each side of
[10:54] it
[10:54] and
[10:55] my approaching this
[10:57] in this way at the outset before i
[10:59] really kind of get into the meat
[11:01] of the christmas message that is on my
[11:03] heart
[11:04] which is is not necessarily going to be
[11:06] in this service
[11:08] but my purpose is just really to address
[11:10] some subject matters to stimulate our
[11:11] minds
[11:13] instead of just thinking uh one way and
[11:15] being close-minded and closing off the
[11:17] word of god and putting a period on
[11:18] things or just adapting maybe something
[11:20] that we've been told but to really allow
[11:23] the word of god in its totality to begin
[11:25] to be impressed in our mind to come in
[11:28] our minds and stir up our pure minds and
[11:30] maybe impress itself in our hearts so
[11:31] that we have a well-rounded view
[11:34] according to the word of god um how we
[11:36] ought to approach things and how we
[11:37] ought to do certain things especially as
[11:39] it relates to christmas so i wanted to
[11:41] kind of stimulate your minds but at the
[11:42] end of the day the purpose is to bring a
[11:44] balance in the word of god
[11:46] as we read from the statement the deity
[11:48] of jesus christ brother brown preached
[11:49] this i believe it's the first mention of
[11:51] christmas and the message the deity of
[11:53] jesus christ he preached on christmas
[11:55] day 1949 he says the thing of it is it's
[11:58] so easy to fall in that rut on the other
[12:01] side there's a rut on one side there's a
[12:03] rut on the other side he says and push
[12:06] out christ the real fundamentals of
[12:09] christmas
[12:10] we could say the real fundamental of
[12:12] christmas is christ you take christ out
[12:14] of christmas all you have is this maybe
[12:17] a mess and so there's a
[12:19] the real fundamental of christmas is
[12:21] christ but when he says the real
[12:23] fundamentals of christmas that means
[12:25] that there are original principles
[12:28] relating to christmas and again when i
[12:30] say christmas i want to use it in more
[12:32] of a general way and not get too
[12:33] specific about
[12:35] dates and details but the original
[12:37] principle of christmas or we could say
[12:38] the birth of christ there are real
[12:40] fundamentals of that original principles
[12:43] and rules related to christmas and
[12:46] that's what brother branham identifies
[12:47] in this statement you have this way of
[12:48] celebrating you have this myth and you
[12:50] have this person and all these other
[12:51] things but when what we allow that to do
[12:53] is to push christ out of it he says
[12:55] there's no room for him at the end
[12:58] now on the subject of christmas myths a
[13:01] myth is an untrue story now there could
[13:04] be some element of truth to it but the
[13:06] reason why it's called a myth
[13:07] is it's an untrue story or rumor a myth
[13:11] is something that's imaginary
[13:13] and uh would be and i'm using a very
[13:15] strict definition perhaps of myth but it
[13:17] would be a fictitious object or a
[13:19] fiction fiction a tale of fiction
[13:22] or of whether it be an object or a
[13:24] situation or location or an individual
[13:27] that's generally what a myth refers to
[13:30] there could be ways that it could be
[13:31] referred to as legend there's a lot of
[13:34] uh academic discussion about what a myth
[13:37] is and what separates it from legend and
[13:39] if it's associated with religion it
[13:40] becomes one thing
[13:42] if it's associated with other uh
[13:45] practices or paganism it's something
[13:47] else but overall i use the term myth to
[13:49] refer to something that is imaginary or
[13:51] fictitious something that is untrue yet
[13:54] it's a story or tell of something that
[13:56] kind of has a
[13:57] details it becomes a mythology it's a
[13:59] myth that's really we hold it in our
[14:01] minds and it has some
[14:03] meaning to it but there's no truth to it
[14:06] is the idea that i'm referring to and so
[14:08] we're uh maybe
[14:10] putting we're looking at fact versus
[14:12] fiction
[14:13] that you have you have myth on one side
[14:15] and then you have truth on the other
[14:17] side you have fact versus fiction or
[14:19] fundamentals as brother branham would
[14:20] say the real fundamentals of christmas
[14:22] or the myths of christians christmas
[14:26] and the distinction i'm going through
[14:28] this exercise and i'm looking at this
[14:31] so that we as a church and we look at it
[14:33] together
[14:34] for the sake of truth
[14:36] but the idea is not just to go through
[14:38] and pick through something and say oh
[14:39] this is wrong and that's wrong and this
[14:41] is wrong as that that's wrong because
[14:42] really what we could do is take
[14:44] everything away from you and then leave
[14:46] you with nothing at all so the goal
[14:47] isn't to take this away and take that
[14:49] away and tear this down and tear that
[14:51] down but really the goal is to kind of
[14:53] sift through everything and find the
[14:55] truth
[14:56] and a lot of this comes back to how the
[14:58] lord has been dealing with me and we
[14:59] ministered on the subject of blind trust
[15:01] and bad faith that's with a lot of
[15:03] things that we just trust blindly that
[15:06] we ought not to and there's things that
[15:07] we can we call faith but it's really not
[15:09] faith we trust in it we believe in it
[15:11] and if it's not the word that's bad it's
[15:13] bad faith bad faith and blind trust
[15:15] there's a lot of things that we can hold
[15:17] as guiding principles and truths and
[15:19] convictions but if it's not if it
[15:21] doesn't have some basis it's not tangent
[15:24] to or in some way connected to the word
[15:26] of god or we haven't found a real
[15:29] reasoning in the scripture as to why we
[15:31] do it we need to be very careful in
[15:33] those areas
[15:34] and perhaps what happens is
[15:37] i'm trying just to remember exactly how
[15:39] the lord had dealt with my heart
[15:41] uh um in the in this way and i believe
[15:43] we touched on it last service how it's
[15:45] these things that come up and when
[15:47] there's really no basis
[15:49] in the word of god it becomes a
[15:52] fanaticism
[15:54] and then what the only thing that can
[15:55] keep that alive is something that's not
[15:57] true or something that's only partly
[15:59] true
[16:00] and so we then we we have to feed off of
[16:02] other things to kind of keep that idea
[16:05] alive instead of the word of god
[16:07] and it's not even that the word of god
[16:09] would tear that down but if you begin to
[16:10] feed on the word of god that thing would
[16:12] become so weak
[16:14] that it would kind of just shrivel up to
[16:16] its proper place in your paradigm maybe
[16:19] not get rid of it completely but it
[16:20] would find its place but the only way to
[16:22] keep that idea alive is to feed on
[16:24] things that aren't in the word of god so
[16:26] it's a it's a matter of not being
[16:28] distracted and feeding things that keep
[16:31] things very very large in our conscience
[16:33] in our spirits that really don't need to
[16:35] be not even an issue of right or wrong
[16:37] it may be absolutely right but it
[16:39] doesn't need to be that big
[16:41] like that's true but it's not that tall
[16:43] that's true but it's not that big it's
[16:45] true but it's not that important so
[16:47] certain things that we could really put
[16:49] into place
[16:50] and be balanced in
[16:53] now as we
[16:54] refer to christmas myths and i'm really
[16:56] nervous about the lisp in that
[16:59] um there are
[17:01] the myths are in both extremes
[17:05] it's myths that perpetuate the
[17:06] celebration of christmas and really a
[17:08] lot of the things i'm looking at right
[17:09] now in modern times it's myths that
[17:11] perpetuate the celebration it's the
[17:13] myths that
[17:14] in law that are the most uh pronounced
[17:17] ways of celebrating would you agree that
[17:19] what we see nowadays in with respect to
[17:22] christianity is not necessarily truth on
[17:24] display but more tradition and legend
[17:28] and mythology that is celebrated during
[17:30] the time of christmas but not only do
[17:32] myths perpetuate the celebration it's
[17:33] myths that perpetuate the criticism
[17:36] a lot of myths that that follow up
[17:38] behind and become the real the real acts
[17:40] or the sword or the meat to criticism of
[17:43] christmas
[17:44] as
[17:45] there's different titles that kind of
[17:47] begin to come into my mind in terms of
[17:49] how we might title the service
[17:52] but there's a it's the question many
[17:53] times of to celebrate or not to
[17:55] celebrate
[17:56] right
[17:58] to celebrate or not to celebrate to tree
[17:59] or not to tree
[18:02] these are the these are the big
[18:03] questions that begin to build up around
[18:06] thanksgiving and just after thanksgiving
[18:07] to celebrate or not but to tree or not
[18:10] to tree that is the question
[18:12] but remember the danger
[18:14] the dangers are in the ruts
[18:17] there's no danger in the truth the
[18:19] danger or is in the ruts the danger is
[18:21] in the frivolity of celebrating or
[18:24] there's also a danger in the animosity
[18:26] towards the celebrating
[18:28] the dangers are in the ruts there's no
[18:30] danger in the middle of the road but the
[18:31] dangers of when we allow the one extreme
[18:33] to push us into the other we go out of
[18:35] one ditch into the other or we stay very
[18:37] very much entrenched in the way we are
[18:39] because we see the frivolity or the
[18:42] criticism on the other side
[18:44] it's the idea that it's been expressed
[18:46] before on how that you have
[18:49] license on one hand
[18:51] and legalism on the other
[18:53] and you have those that are in license
[18:55] and they just make the grace of god a
[18:57] disgrace but then you have people on the
[18:58] other side that are legalists
[19:00] but where is the balance
[19:03] the liberty of christ
[19:05] right down the middle
[19:07] now this is the funny part
[19:09] if you are absolutely in the liberty of
[19:12] christ to somebody who's a legalist what
[19:14] are you in
[19:16] because you're on the wrong side you're
[19:17] in license
[19:19] but then now you think oh well i've got
[19:20] a friend no to those who are in license
[19:23] you're in perfect liberty so what do you
[19:25] look like a legalist
[19:27] so you can't try to find a balance to
[19:29] please everybody else you got to find a
[19:31] balance to please the lord you've got to
[19:33] find a balance to be in harmony with the
[19:35] spirit of christ that is inside of you
[19:37] and leading you so that there's no
[19:38] dissonance between you and christ so
[19:40] that we can make progress in the
[19:42] christian faith so that we can get out
[19:44] of here
[19:46] we want to leave we don't want to stay
[19:48] so i want to be in the perfect liberty
[19:50] of christ so that i could be leaving and
[19:52] not worry about those who are unlicensed
[19:54] that are going to think i'm a legalist
[19:55] and about the legals who think i'm in
[19:56] license as long as i know i'm in the
[19:58] liberty of christ and that gives me
[20:00] freedom to go forward then that's where
[20:02] i want to be
[20:03] realizing that there's these ruts that
[20:05] form on each side and camps that can be
[20:08] on each side a couple statements there's
[20:10] dozens of these that we could
[20:12] use
[20:13] many many many different statements as a
[20:15] matter of fact i put together a list
[20:16] last month to share with you i'm during
[20:19] this season of several sermons that i
[20:21] felt would be
[20:22] good to listen to during this time and i
[20:25] kind of pondered different ways of
[20:26] making them available and as in the
[20:28] process of getting together
[20:31] putting together had been going through
[20:32] them to put these sd cards together to
[20:35] give to you so that no one would have an
[20:36] excuse say well i don't know how to
[20:38] listen to the message if i heard that it
[20:40] would shock me
[20:41] but there may be some that don't know
[20:42] how to do it
[20:44] but there's several sermons and if
[20:45] you're in who would be interested in
[20:46] getting a list of several sermons we can
[20:47] listen to this month okay well a few of
[20:50] us all right well then i'll send out an
[20:51] email
[20:52] and give you a list of sermons that you
[20:54] could listen to just to stimulate
[20:56] sermons that i have been studying i
[20:58] think that would stimulate your thought
[20:59] process on
[21:01] at this time of year be very very
[21:02] helpful and beneficial and the message
[21:05] sirs we would see jesus this was on
[21:07] christmas eve in 1961 he says but it's
[21:09] also it also was the way of finding
[21:12] truth in life the unusual way not the
[21:15] set routine way but the unusual way this
[21:18] is important really even today when we
[21:20] would think that everything has been
[21:21] properly emphasized and the camps have
[21:23] been formed there's usually some unusual
[21:26] way that's the balance
[21:28] he says it's the unusual way and it's my
[21:30] heart's desire tonight
[21:32] that in this unusual scripture
[21:35] nothing that wouldn't necessarily be
[21:36] related to
[21:38] the birth of christ this unusual
[21:40] scripture that we will find
[21:42] the true meaning of christmas
[21:44] what christmas means to us
[21:46] the way that we should do it or how we
[21:49] should approach christmas
[21:51] these men if i could just say this just
[21:52] to kind of seed a little bit about
[21:54] what's in my heart these men were not
[21:55] seeking
[21:56] a babe in a manger but they were seeking
[21:58] christ
[21:59] he says this is the way this is what
[22:01] this is how we'll find the true meaning
[22:03] of christmas what christmas means to us
[22:05] that's the true meaning and then he says
[22:07] the way we should do it and how we
[22:09] should approach it
[22:10] this is something that's in this sermon
[22:12] that he's identifying very beautifully a
[22:14] very unique christmas message he
[22:16] preaches it in jeffersonville and then
[22:18] he preaches it later in new york
[22:20] uh but here in falling a part of the
[22:21] world this is in jeffersonville in 1962
[22:24] and then when he preaches it later i
[22:26] think it's the next year in new york
[22:28] it's in november and it's even before
[22:30] thanksgiving and he's talking about
[22:31] christmas
[22:32] and like even brother branham wouldn't
[22:34] even wait till after thanksgiving
[22:36] um and he's preaching a christmas
[22:39] message and it's because he originally
[22:40] preached the thought
[22:42] in um in christmas the prior year so
[22:44] here he is
[22:45] december 16th
[22:47] of 1962 and he's praying and we would
[22:49] ask that you would bless us so together
[22:51] in this what we are celebrating
[22:54] the christmas season
[22:56] lord may we find the real spirit of
[22:59] christmas
[23:00] and may it abide with us forever
[23:03] does that bother some people the spirit
[23:05] of christmas
[23:06] because i guess there's a
[23:08] the spirit of christmas that people talk
[23:10] about but he's talking about it in the
[23:12] real spirit of christmas
[23:15] not not the spirit of christmas that
[23:16] causes you to go back to your car and
[23:18] find all the loose change you can to put
[23:20] it in the salvation army bucket
[23:22] uh but this the real spirit of christmas
[23:25] that just doesn't fade away with new
[23:27] year's resolutions
[23:29] like whatever we felt with new christmas
[23:31] and the giving and the joy and i love
[23:33] everybody and in this awesome it fades
[23:36] away once we become very very
[23:37] egotistical about my new year's
[23:40] resolutions what am i going to do for me
[23:43] how am i going to change and what do i
[23:45] regret from this past year and it all
[23:47] fades away the real spirit of christmas
[23:49] the real true meaning of christmas that
[23:51] tells us
[23:52] that there's a true meaning and there's
[23:54] a real spirit
[23:55] related with christmas
[23:58] so we could what
[24:00] what is um
[24:02] what i'm addressing and talking about
[24:04] christmas myths are the things that take
[24:06] us away from the true meaning and spirit
[24:08] of christmas
[24:09] it's the myth it's the missed truths
[24:11] it's the fiction it's the lies it's the
[24:13] it's the incorrect details that take us
[24:16] away from the true meaning of christmas
[24:18] and the spirit of christmas
[24:20] are you with me so far each one of you
[24:22] individually i just want to take my time
[24:24] this morning
[24:26] and share these things with you it's
[24:27] very very heavy
[24:29] burden on my heart as i realized
[24:31] that i am
[24:32] i'm i'm walking on thin ice maybe in
[24:35] some ways i'm a trapeze on on a
[24:38] balancing act between uh two tall towers
[24:41] i need to be very very careful that i
[24:42] don't offend anybody
[24:44] but it's the myths
[24:46] that will devalue the truth of christmas
[24:48] it's the myths that keep us out
[24:51] keep us from the real spirit of
[24:52] christmas
[24:54] now on the subject of christmas this may
[24:56] be where i'm really now starting to
[24:57] unpack the myths and i'm not going to do
[24:58] it like myth number one number two
[25:00] number three
[25:02] but um just maybe start looking at it
[25:05] this this uh gumbo as it were
[25:08] of ideas you know we'll just kind of um
[25:10] okay that was sausage oh that was
[25:12] chicken i don't know what that was but
[25:13] it's in the pot
[25:14] and we just try to think about it
[25:16] together
[25:17] there's two different subjects maybe
[25:19] even questions that relate to christmas
[25:22] and i want to separate these two there
[25:24] is a question of the origins of
[25:25] christmas like how did the uh the the
[25:28] celebration christmas being the
[25:30] celebration of the birth of christ
[25:32] that's a question of where did christmas
[25:34] originate the celebration of the birth
[25:37] of christ that's one question but then
[25:39] there's also another question of the
[25:41] date of the birth of christ so those are
[25:43] two separate questions one when was
[25:45] christ born you recognize that would be
[25:47] a different question right
[25:49] but then there's also a question would
[25:51] that be a different question then what
[25:53] are the origins of celebrating the birth
[25:54] of christ it makes sense that those are
[25:56] two different
[25:57] uh there's overlap obviously but there's
[25:59] those are two different questions in two
[26:01] different controversies um in two
[26:04] different discussions in some ways the
[26:06] origins of christmas and the date of
[26:08] christ's birth either way whether it be
[26:11] the origins of the celebration of his
[26:13] birth or the actual date of his birth
[26:15] the central issue is christ's birthday
[26:18] christmas is talking about the day when
[26:20] christ was born and then kind of what
[26:23] flows from that a lot of times is when
[26:25] to celebrate his birth if you're going
[26:26] to celebrate it at all so do we
[26:28] celebrate it yes or no no then don't
[26:31] worry about the date yes then when do we
[26:33] celebrate it does it matter when we
[26:34] celebrate that's kind of maybe the
[26:36] decision tree that we could have easily
[26:38] charted out for us uh do we celebrate it
[26:40] yes or no no then we don't need to worry
[26:42] about it take the name of jesus with you
[26:44] and we all go home
[26:46] salad to go and go or whatever and we
[26:48] enjoy our afternoons
[26:50] uh and and whatever we want to do on a
[26:52] sunday
[26:53] but there's obviously more to it we say
[26:56] yes oh yes we celebrate it then it could
[26:57] we could stay a few minutes longer and
[26:59] try to figure out the actual date that
[27:01] we would celebrate it
[27:03] but
[27:04] since it kind of revolves around a
[27:06] birthday remember i'm just want to
[27:07] stimulate thinking so if if we're all
[27:09] together in this i want to just all of a
[27:11] sudden just i think just kind of catch
[27:13] you by surprise
[27:15] but it's all about whether or not we
[27:16] celebrate a birthday
[27:18] but if we kind of take a step back a
[27:20] little bit there's really no history in
[27:21] scripture or even church history
[27:24] of any christians or jews or anyone for
[27:26] that matter ever celebrating a birthday
[27:28] period
[27:30] have you ever thought about that
[27:32] a birthday celebration a festival some
[27:35] festivities to commemorate a day when
[27:37] someone was born and so i want you to
[27:38] consider
[27:40] um the first where the origins or the
[27:42] ideas that we find in scripture with
[27:44] respect to birthday celebrations and
[27:46] what it signified scripturally and i'm
[27:48] just doing it to stimulate your minds
[27:51] i'm not trying to create a camp a new
[27:53] doctor and like well we at arizona
[27:55] believers don't even celebrate birthdays
[27:59] like we're more holy now because we
[28:02] figured it out that the air wasn't
[28:04] actually in christmas the air was
[28:06] actually in birthdays completely
[28:09] the only birthday we celebrate is when
[28:11] we were born again
[28:14] it's not that it's to be balanced
[28:16] but in job chapter 14 verse 4 again this
[28:19] is just to kind of stimulate your minds
[28:21] job says who can bring a clean thing out
[28:23] of an unclean one not one
[28:26] kind of the even i think one translation
[28:28] actually renders it that a man is
[28:30] unclean from the moment of his birth
[28:32] regardless of how short his life is
[28:35] that a baby only lived three uh three
[28:38] months or three minutes the scripture
[28:40] says a man who's born
[28:43] is unclean from his birth and there's so
[28:45] many other scriptures we could have used
[28:46] that speak of just a man born in this
[28:49] manner and having come in that manner
[28:51] it's an uncleanness so here's his he
[28:54] said a man who can bring an unclean out
[28:55] of an unclean no one can bring a clean
[28:58] from an unclean man is unclean therefore
[29:00] children that are born of a woman are
[29:02] unclean
[29:03] then leviticus chapter 12 verse 2 and
[29:06] there's several other verses
[29:08] that could be used in the law but it
[29:09] says speak unto the children of israel
[29:11] saying if a woman have conceived seed
[29:15] it's important to note what it's
[29:16] referring to through natural relations
[29:18] and born a man child
[29:20] then she shall be unclean seven days
[29:23] according to the days of the separation
[29:24] for her infirmity
[29:26] and she shall be uncleaned and speaks
[29:29] she's unclean for longer if she has a
[29:30] girl
[29:33] that's another series i guess
[29:36] but
[29:37] it's just saying that when a woman has a
[29:38] baby that she conceives by natural
[29:41] relationships she has a child she's
[29:43] considered unclean
[29:44] i want you to kind of recognize what the
[29:46] characterization of the birth is under
[29:49] the law
[29:50] that the natural birth of
[29:52] unclean uh
[29:54] man and a woman do not bring forth the
[29:56] clean child the child itself is born
[29:58] unclaimed therefore the woman even given
[30:00] birth through this process
[30:02] she is characterized as unclean by the
[30:05] act of birth i want you to realize the
[30:07] place that the scripture puts the
[30:09] birthday
[30:10] and the act of giving birth
[30:13] and the celebration of one's birthday in
[30:15] the scripture was only done by heathens
[30:19] not a lot of birthdays in the scripture
[30:21] but in genesis chapter 40 verse 20 says
[30:23] it came to pass the third day this is in
[30:25] the story of joseph which was pharaoh's
[30:27] birthday
[30:29] that he made a feast unto all his
[30:30] servants and he lifted up the head of
[30:32] the chief butler and of the chief baker
[30:35] among his servants you're thinking oh
[30:37] it's a time for a promotion right it's
[30:39] my birthday pharaoh's birthday they're
[30:41] all enjoying his birthday and he brings
[30:43] up the butler and the baker who had been
[30:44] in jail with joseph and now this would
[30:46] be a great opportunity for them to tell
[30:48] the pharaoh hey you know there's a guy
[30:49] who knows dreams
[30:51] and what did he do in this birthday
[30:53] celebration he hung the baker
[30:56] this is what he does it's his birthday
[30:58] and to celebrate his birthday it's this
[31:01] uh sensual demonic
[31:04] taking of life the shedding of blood
[31:06] that commemorates his birthday and this
[31:08] is what the heathen does to celebrate a
[31:10] birthday he hangs a baker
[31:13] the only other mention that we have of a
[31:15] birthday celebration is in mark chapter
[31:17] 6 verse 21 and when a convenient day was
[31:20] come that herod on his birthday made a
[31:23] supper to his lords herod not being a
[31:25] jew made a supper to his lords as high
[31:27] captains and the chief estates of
[31:29] galilee what does he end up doing
[31:32] executing john beheading john
[31:36] so here in these birthdays pharaoh's
[31:37] birthday celebration results in the
[31:39] hanging of a baker then herod celebrates
[31:42] his birthday and what does he do he
[31:44] executes john on his birthday this is
[31:46] the place that the scriptures put the
[31:49] birthday
[31:53] in jeremiah chapter 20 verse 14 cursed
[31:56] be the day wherein i was born
[31:58] let not the day wherein my mother bear
[32:00] me be blessed
[32:03] this is a scriptural attitude towards
[32:04] one's birthday when they recognize just
[32:06] how small they are how flawed they are
[32:07] maybe the difficulties they have in life
[32:09] their mistakes their shortcomings he is
[32:11] saying not only don't celebrate my
[32:13] birthday
[32:16] but curse the day
[32:18] let it not be a blessed day
[32:22] it said it was said in the early church
[32:24] that not only did saints and believers
[32:28] not celebrate their birthday but those
[32:30] who are filled with the holy spirit
[32:31] cursed the day
[32:33] because it stood in such dark contrast
[32:36] to the newness of life that you
[32:37] experienced when you're born again
[32:39] it's like you it starts all it's
[32:41] something that's more precious to you
[32:44] listen it ought to mean more to us that
[32:46] there were christians than than were
[32:48] that were texans
[32:51] right
[32:52] any texans here
[32:54] i was at texas well eliza raised her
[32:56] hand she's the only one listening um i
[32:58] was at texas a little hole in the wall
[33:00] steakhouse here in phoenix the owner i
[33:02] think is from texas and it's all texas
[33:03] stuff texas
[33:05] and was talking to the owner this many
[33:07] many years ago and i was talking all
[33:09] about texas with texas braggadocio and
[33:12] he was like ah are you a texan and then
[33:14] it's like the moment of truth no i was
[33:16] actually born in arizona but i got to
[33:18] texas as fast as i could
[33:21] and he's like oh well that doesn't count
[33:23] i said but i was born again in texas
[33:25] and he goes all right i'll give it to
[33:27] you i didn't get a discount or anything
[33:28] but
[33:29] it's the new birth that ought to mean
[33:31] more to us than the nation of our birth
[33:33] we're not americans we are christian
[33:36] right
[33:37] that's the part and so you see this
[33:38] theme in scripture as jeremiah said
[33:40] curse my birthday
[33:42] i'm not again i'm not suggesting a new
[33:44] paradigm
[33:45] i knew you know when's your curse day
[33:48] and we're going to change the church
[33:49] directory to list the dates of curse in
[33:51] one column
[33:53] somebody celebrated a curse day this
[33:54] past week i know in the plet family one
[33:56] of the plet celebrated a birthday this
[33:58] past week
[33:59] not to cause any guilt for the manner in
[34:02] which these things are celebrated but
[34:03] just notice what the scripture is saying
[34:05] about it in job chapter 3 verses 1 to 3
[34:07] skip to verse 7. this is job after this
[34:10] opened job his mouth and cursed his day
[34:12] what day the day he was born
[34:14] and job spake and said let the day
[34:16] perish wherein i was born and the nine
[34:18] in which it was said there is a
[34:20] man-child conceived let that day be
[34:22] darkness let not god regard it from
[34:24] above neither let the light shine upon
[34:26] it
[34:28] what does that mean for my birthday
[34:29] party verse seven lo let there be
[34:31] solitary let no joyful voice come
[34:33] therein
[34:35] this is an attitude towards
[34:37] the birthday
[34:40] and i want you to think about this for a
[34:41] moment
[34:43] based upon the attitude of
[34:47] jeremiah and job and i know there's a
[34:48] connection to their grief and their
[34:50] sorrow and their sins
[34:52] and
[34:53] the scriptures in leviticus
[34:56] and then the fact that birthdays in the
[34:57] scripture are only celebrated by
[34:58] heathens
[35:00] it would be more pagan to celebrate your
[35:02] birthday than it would be to honor
[35:03] christ's birthday
[35:06] i mean just stimulating thinking i
[35:08] didn't say that it is
[35:10] right but could it be
[35:13] that's celebrating our birthdays and
[35:15] when we have it marked on the count we
[35:16] have a really really big party and
[35:18] everyone brings gifts and there's cake
[35:20] and there's lights and there's confetti
[35:22] and there's tinsel and everything's just
[35:24] done up really really big and they're
[35:26] singing secular songs happy birthday
[35:29] right
[35:31] and and playing pagan games blindfolded
[35:34] peeling the tail on the donkey and all
[35:36] sorts of things that we do and all the
[35:38] traditions that are mixed into it um
[35:40] these are the things that we do on our
[35:42] birthday and the festivities and the
[35:43] frivolity and the excitement and all the
[35:45] things that we do hey and you say well
[35:47] that's for the kitties come on don't
[35:49] fool yourselves
[35:53] i mean what do we do for people's 40th
[35:55] birthday party
[35:56] look at how christian is we all dress in
[35:59] black right and the grim reaper really
[36:02] scriptural
[36:03] uh
[36:04] symbol symbolisms evident and present
[36:07] at these occasions and i want i'm just
[36:09] i'm just saying i'm not trying to you
[36:11] know stir anybody up and i don't want to
[36:13] create an anti-birthday segment but
[36:16] maybe i'm just wanting people to think
[36:17] more deeply about their convictions and
[36:19] their personal dogma that
[36:21] it might be pagan just to celebrate a
[36:23] birthday
[36:26] let alone christmas and i know some
[36:27] people are now sharpening their swords
[36:31] you got that right brother i never
[36:33] thought about it that way
[36:36] no more
[36:38] uh baby showers and
[36:41] no more birthday celebrations
[36:44] but think about this the bible says in
[36:45] psalm 51 5 david says behold i was
[36:48] shaping in iniquity and in sin did my
[36:50] mother conceive me says elsewhere the
[36:52] wicked are estranged from the womb that
[36:55] this event of a birth though
[36:57] though it may
[36:58] we know the side of it being a gift from
[37:01] god a heritage of the lord a great joy
[37:03] in having children and there's this
[37:05] whole side to it but there's a darkness
[37:07] to the fact that it is a child that is
[37:09] conceived in sin that it has been
[37:11] brought forth through iniquity shaped in
[37:13] iniquity incended my mother conceived me
[37:16] like these are the factors that came to
[37:18] bear upon job announcing what he did
[37:21] about his birth these are the factors
[37:23] that came to bear upon the very law in
[37:25] leviticus that a man born of a woman
[37:27] comes through
[37:29] that way with the stain of the first sin
[37:32] that comes through with the stain
[37:34] of wickedness and and it's shapen in
[37:36] iniquity in sin was i conceived
[37:39] that's our birthday
[37:42] but then think about the birth of christ
[37:45] it doesn't have the stain of any of that
[37:48] it says in matthew chapter 1 verse 23
[37:50] behold a virgin shall be with child
[37:52] there's a very important distinction
[37:53] that's being made in the prophecy and
[37:56] the fulfillment of jesus christ a virgin
[37:58] shall be with child and shall bring
[38:00] forth a son and they shall call his name
[38:03] emmanuel which being interpreted is god
[38:05] with us when you compare this to
[38:07] leviticus 12 2 you'll find that a woman
[38:10] who has conceived seed and born a child
[38:13] it refers to conception through a
[38:15] natural act and then brings forth a
[38:17] child that's what's dealt with in
[38:18] leviticus 12 but jesus does not fit
[38:21] within leviticus 12 neither does mary
[38:24] and i know that contributes to the merry
[38:26] myth but what does that mean the birth
[38:28] of christ is not stained with the
[38:30] uncleanness of natural birth
[38:35] it says a virgin shall be with child not
[38:37] necessarily conceived from a man it's
[38:39] it's implying a distinction from
[38:41] leviticus chapter 12 so that the birth
[38:44] of jesus does not carry with it the
[38:47] baggage of our birthday
[38:52] so
[38:56] with all of us
[38:58] you know wondering about birthdays
[39:01] i don't think we should be wondering
[39:02] about it but that's interesting isn't it
[39:04] have you ever thought about your
[39:05] birthday that way some of them i have a
[39:07] distinct memory of one of my birthdays
[39:09] being completely forgotten
[39:11] i mean i distinctly remember no one ever
[39:13] saying happy birthday and not being
[39:14] celebrated at all my family doesn't
[39:16] quite remember it that way but i
[39:18] remember it that way and until they
[39:19] remember the way i remember it
[39:22] we're never going forward
[39:25] not this family it's my
[39:28] my other family
[39:30] but the um
[39:32] in that now with that in mind just to
[39:34] stimulate some thinking wow maybe maybe
[39:35] the whole birthday thing is uh is where
[39:37] the problem is
[39:39] now let's look at christ's birthday the
[39:40] new testament does not mention any
[39:43] celebration of christ's birthday like an
[39:45] anniversary or continued celebration of
[39:48] christ's birthday we do recognize in
[39:49] scripture as we read in luke chapter 2
[39:51] that on the day of his birth and as the
[39:53] scriptures com
[39:54] walk us through the chronology of
[39:56] christ's coming that only the story is
[39:58] told of announcement conception birth
[40:02] and these details are still told in the
[40:04] way of a story but as the chronology
[40:06] unfolds you don't find a moment going
[40:08] forward where there's any celebration of
[40:10] christ's birthday
[40:12] we call it nativity a nativity
[40:14] celebration or christmas different words
[40:16] that we might use for christmas it's not
[40:18] mentioned at all in the book of acts so
[40:20] we have the um acts of the holy ghost
[40:21] through the disciples and the apostles
[40:23] we don't see a christmas celebration
[40:25] it's not mentioned in any of the gospels
[40:27] other than the description and the
[40:29] chronology of his birth there's not a
[40:30] subsequent moment where his birthday is
[40:32] celebrated
[40:34] and then in the gospels or the book of
[40:36] acts which kind of formed
[40:38] the real meat of the chronology of
[40:40] christ and the disciples
[40:42] there's no date exact date given for
[40:45] when christ was born
[40:47] it's not even explicitly mentioned what
[40:49] time of year a real direct reference to
[40:51] the time of year there's certain things
[40:52] that you can draw from it and ways that
[40:55] you can begin to piece things together
[40:56] but it's not that it doesn't say
[40:59] in the in 6 bc
[41:01] in springtime on the 15th of nassau
[41:04] christ was born being like what the
[41:06] bible says he was born on this date in
[41:07] the spring it's kind of absent in that
[41:10] there's actually no early christian
[41:12] writings that mention the celebration of
[41:13] christ's birth you don't find that paul
[41:16] was celebrating it nor irenaeus who is a
[41:20] disciple of polycarp in these
[41:21] contemporaries you don't see any mention
[41:23] of paul i realize these church-age
[41:25] messengers you don't see them
[41:27] celebrating the birth of christ
[41:30] and i found this thought this is just a
[41:33] thought that came to me
[41:34] you have a lot of prophecies
[41:37] that point forward to the birth of
[41:38] christ
[41:40] scriptures then that kind of gather up
[41:42] the prophecies of his birth so you have
[41:44] scriptures in the old testament pointing
[41:46] forward the new testament kind of begins
[41:47] with the summation of that the climax of
[41:50] that but then going forward now from
[41:52] that moment on there's no scriptures in
[41:55] the new testament pointing backwards
[41:59] i found it very interesting and i think
[42:01] it's it we recognize that there's a lot
[42:03] of scriptures pointing forward but then
[42:05] once it's fulfilled there's really none
[42:07] pointing us back to say this is a moment
[42:10] that must be honored or revered or
[42:11] celebrated or or there's no subsequent
[42:14] mentioning paul is not writing in third
[42:16] corinthians you know and remember
[42:18] december 25th or remember this or
[42:20] remember that we don't find these things
[42:22] being emphasized
[42:24] there is we could say very safely no
[42:26] biblical commandment to celebrate
[42:28] christ's birth
[42:30] could we agree on that is that something
[42:31] that maybe is a safe area to be no
[42:34] biblical commandment no scripture that
[42:36] tells us that christians celebrate the
[42:38] date of christ's birth or to celebrate
[42:41] annually or at any time at all the
[42:43] birthday of christ
[42:45] now there's a parallel to this again i'm
[42:47] just trying to stimulate thinking
[42:49] the same is so with easter
[42:53] i'm just saying this to stimulate
[42:55] thinking and to be balanced there's a
[42:57] parallel of christmas celebrations and
[42:59] also the celebration of easter an easter
[43:02] celebration is not mentioned in the
[43:03] bible at all
[43:06] just as there is no prescription to
[43:07] celebrate christmas there is no
[43:10] scriptures that specifically mention
[43:12] the
[43:13] honoring and celebrating easter the date
[43:16] of the resurrection
[43:18] now i'll come to it hopefully here in a
[43:19] little bit there's a lot of myths
[43:20] associated with easter too a lot of
[43:23] traditions associated with easter
[43:25] but there's no command given to the
[43:27] church to annually celebrate the
[43:29] resurrection wait we don't find that in
[43:30] the bible
[43:32] so i say that to cause the balance and
[43:34] say well there's no place in the
[43:36] scripture at all where we should
[43:37] celebrate christmas and but we wouldn't
[43:39] want to get dogmatic about that because
[43:41] there is no scripture in the bible that
[43:43] tells us that we must celebrate easter
[43:45] and so we could say in one sense if you
[43:47] want to be consistent then just start
[43:48] throwing them all out
[43:50] and guess what
[43:51] some people have
[43:54] there's theologies and schools of
[43:56] thought in groups and cults that have
[43:58] completely banished
[44:00] every holiday every celebration
[44:02] birthdays easter christmas you name it
[44:05] none of those things and they've done it
[44:07] for the sake of sanctifying their
[44:09] children and staying far away
[44:11] from paganism um but we are not trying
[44:14] to fit into some sort of man-made
[44:17] uh
[44:18] sterilized environment that's going to
[44:20] keep us free from all these things
[44:22] because what happens when you build up a
[44:24] lot of barriers to try to protect people
[44:26] and it's man-made eventually you just
[44:28] protect them you're insulating them from
[44:30] truth that can change their lives
[44:34] now in the two separate questions we
[44:35] came up with the origins of celebrating
[44:37] christmas and christ's actual birthday
[44:39] they kind of collide these two separate
[44:41] questions begin to collide on with the
[44:43] subject of december 25th
[44:47] and
[44:48] it's really fascinating we do not i
[44:51] would say that i speak for all of us
[44:52] when we say that we do not believe that
[44:54] jesus christ was born on the day
[44:56] december 25th like we have a birthday we
[44:58] have a birth certificate there's a lot
[44:59] of different ways that our actual
[45:01] birthday can be memorialized and we
[45:02] believe that we were born on that day
[45:06] and
[45:08] it's in that way that we have
[45:11] some sort of we have this understanding
[45:12] what a day of birth day is but there's
[45:14] no uh we do not believe that christ was
[45:16] born on the actual day of december 25th
[45:19] or
[45:19] we don't believe he was even born in the
[45:21] winter so that kind of
[45:23] takes care of part four i think it is
[45:26] we want to revisit it again because it's
[45:27] interesting to look at it but there's so
[45:29] much debate and
[45:30] scholarship volumes and volumes of
[45:34] writings and studies and
[45:36] uh papers and articles and comments
[45:39] commentaries and volumes of books that
[45:41] have been written debates that have been
[45:42] had on the subject and there's a lot of
[45:44] attempts to kind of trace the history of
[45:46] this is where we are and these are the
[45:48] pieces we have to work with is there a
[45:49] way that we can use this and work
[45:51] backwards and use history and use all
[45:54] these different things to try to
[45:55] pinpoint and come up with a particular
[45:57] date when christ was born and what's
[46:00] fascinating when you really begin to
[46:01] take a deep dive into it and you begin
[46:03] to read a lot and read a lot and read a
[46:05] lot and try to find where people are
[46:07] coming from and what kind of evidence
[46:08] there is knowing exactly what brother
[46:10] branham taught you find that christmas
[46:14] and the birthday of christ don't seem to
[46:16] have been a concern to the early church
[46:18] like the early christians in the early
[46:20] church which was god's first church and
[46:22] the believers walking and the truth of
[46:23] the word of god it doesn't seem to have
[46:25] been much of a concern to them because
[46:27] you don't find in their writings and
[46:28] their debatings and their discussions
[46:30] you don't find the question coming up
[46:31] but what day was he actually born
[46:34] it's almost as if it had been over
[46:36] overshadowed by the purpose of his birth
[46:39] and not having such gained the
[46:40] preeminence to the early church because
[46:42] it's not until the second century that
[46:44] there's even a record of interest in the
[46:46] birth or the birth date of christ
[46:48] not until 100 years later after the
[46:50] birth of christ in the second century
[46:52] the hundreds of years after the church
[46:54] has been born that you actually find
[46:56] recorded interest of when was he born
[46:58] and and what date was he born on
[47:02] and it's not until the fourth century so
[47:04] this is the fourth century that we find
[47:06] references to the two dates that are
[47:08] celebrated now for christmas and is that
[47:10] that may be a revelation to some people
[47:11] there's actually two dates
[47:13] uh that were celebrated for christmas
[47:15] december 25th in the western roman
[47:17] empire in january 6 in the eastern
[47:20] so if you convert after the 25th to the
[47:23] eastern
[47:24] then you could have two christmases
[47:28] right
[47:29] it's still celebrated today by many
[47:30] january 6th especially
[47:32] at the time in the fourth century see
[47:34] december 25th in the western uh roman
[47:36] empire but then in the eastern
[47:37] especially like in egypt and
[47:39] in asia minor they celebrated christmas
[47:41] on january 6. there's a lot of reasons
[47:43] why they pinpointed those dates
[47:45] it's december 26th that stuck for most
[47:47] christians
[47:49] and then january 6 kind of became a
[47:51] separate feast a feast of epiphany that
[47:54] even some christians i think even the
[47:55] amish celebrated on the 25th but then
[47:57] the sixth is the feast of epiphany it's
[47:59] another uh special
[48:02] observance and christmas festivity and
[48:04] if you count the days between the 25th
[48:06] and the 6th that's the period that
[48:07] became known as
[48:09] the 12 days of christmas and all the
[48:11] weird gifts that were given
[48:15] on those 12 days
[48:16] that's where we get the 12 days of
[48:18] christmas
[48:19] is that period between the 25th and the
[48:22] 6th
[48:24] it's 300 years nearly 300 years after
[48:28] christ is born that people begin to
[48:30] widely observe christ's birth in
[48:32] mid-winter
[48:33] it's it's not like the early church you
[48:35] know you read in the book of acts and it
[48:37] says it was december 25th and we all got
[48:39] together for an ugly sweater party and
[48:42] white elephant gifts or whatever they
[48:43] would have given at the time
[48:45] there's this is not happening in the
[48:47] early church it's not even happening
[48:48] within the christian church it's not
[48:49] even happening on a broad scale it's not
[48:52] until 300 years after his birth that you
[48:54] begin to see christians or people wildly
[48:56] observing on a broad way christ's birth
[48:59] in mid-winter in this december january
[49:01] time period
[49:03] and there's a lot of theories as to why
[49:04] they started doing it a lot of theories
[49:06] you think there's just one there's just
[49:08] one reason there's only one reason why
[49:09] that came to be there's a lot of
[49:11] theories but the most well-known even
[49:13] outside of message
[49:15] understanding and message teaching the
[49:16] most well-known theory as to why
[49:18] december 25th in this mid-winter time
[49:21] was chosen for the celebration of
[49:23] christmas is that the dates were
[49:24] borrowed from pagans
[49:26] that there was a conscious decision made
[49:28] even in the three uh the third century
[49:31] that we are going to celebrate christmas
[49:33] on this date to align ourselves with
[49:35] paganism
[49:37] and truly the romans had a midwinter
[49:39] festival to saturn saturnalia it was
[49:42] celebrated in late december
[49:44] and throughout history there was a lot
[49:46] of other pagans and pagan religions that
[49:48] kept holy days or holidays or
[49:50] observances and feast around the same
[49:52] time so
[49:53] there's a lot of pagan activity going on
[49:55] during that time
[49:56] could we not just all agree pick a day
[49:59] any day
[50:00] there's some pagan stuff going on
[50:02] right i mean no matter what
[50:05] the pagans are up to something
[50:07] every day of the year
[50:09] throughout all history
[50:11] and so it's not like you can find this
[50:13] this is a holy day the devil's took the
[50:16] day off we get to claim april 16th this
[50:19] is the day like this is awesome this is
[50:22] great no there's there's pagan rituals
[50:24] there's pagan festivities there's events
[50:25] and circumstances and remember the devil
[50:27] is a great impersonator great a defiler
[50:31] and there's a copy and a mimicry that
[50:33] takes place if there's a truth the
[50:34] devil's impersonating the false copy and
[50:37] so you're always you're going to find
[50:38] this and we talked about it in the faith
[50:40] of abraham how that coming out of
[50:42] babylon and in genesis chapter 11 and
[50:44] it's the birth of all false religions
[50:47] and polytheism and it taints everything
[50:49] throughout history so no matter what it
[50:51] is you're going to find some sort of
[50:53] connection back to paganism
[50:57] or you can make one
[50:59] building altars is associated with
[51:01] paganism
[51:03] and throughout the life of abraham my
[51:04] goodness this guy is one altar building
[51:06] dude
[51:08] did you know sacrificing your children
[51:10] was a pagan ritual
[51:12] and abraham has taken isaac up mount
[51:15] moriah to do a pagan thing
[51:18] seemingly not objecting at all do i have
[51:20] your mind do i have a thank you in a
[51:21] little bit
[51:23] how there's things that can be cast as
[51:25] pagan and associated with paganism that
[51:26] we just to meet us oh that's paganism
[51:28] but what abraham might have been doing
[51:30] could be cast in light of paganism
[51:32] because remember the devil's tactic
[51:36] again don't get nervous we're right
[51:38] we're just going to be right in the word
[51:39] of god
[51:44] it was in
[51:45] 274 a.d ireland a roman emperor
[51:48] established
[51:49] soul invictus the sole invictus feast
[51:52] notice the date of that
[51:54] this is in the year 274 this is well
[51:56] after the church has been established
[51:57] well after the birth of christ
[51:59] you could say 274 after christ a d
[52:02] that a roman emperor establishes the
[52:04] feast which is called the birth of the
[52:06] unconquered sun
[52:08] referring to the sun
[52:10] the birth soul invictus the birth of the
[52:12] unconquered sun it relates to this of
[52:15] the winter solstice time and he
[52:16] established this feast on
[52:19] december 25th
[52:21] and many of this viewed
[52:23] this
[52:24] roman emperor's
[52:26] proclamation as an attempt to create
[52:29] a pagan alternative to december 25th
[52:32] because december 25th by that time had
[52:34] begun to get some traction within the
[52:36] christian community amongst people that
[52:37] believed in christ
[52:39] and the christian religion at large to
[52:41] where there was many that started to
[52:42] observe during this mid-winter time that
[52:44] perhaps and they have these different
[52:45] reasons and they're not and a lot of the
[52:47] reasons in genesis had nothing to do
[52:49] with paganism they were looking at
[52:51] hebrew tradition and different things to
[52:53] fix this date and this point at which
[52:55] christ was born and i think i might get
[52:57] into it at a later time
[52:59] but it was at this time that some say
[53:02] that aurelian did this on purpose
[53:04] because now the 25th is starting to gain
[53:06] some traction within this religion and
[53:08] now the emperor says no december 25th is
[53:11] going to be the birth of the unconquered
[53:14] son as some sort of rivalry to the
[53:17] christian celebration
[53:19] but we know for a fact that constantine
[53:22] took the church the roman church and
[53:24] deliberate this was a deliberate
[53:27] thing that constatine did he
[53:28] deliberately begin to adapt pagan
[53:30] festivals in order to christianize them
[53:33] whatever rillian's purpose and mode of
[53:35] an objective was in creating this
[53:37] festival of the birth of the unconquered
[53:39] son recognize that that festival on the
[53:41] 25th that particular one was not before
[53:43] the birth of christ but came later
[53:46] almost 300 years later
[53:48] and then when constantine comes whatever
[53:50] these other pagan celebrations may be
[53:52] they could have been recent inventions
[53:54] at the time they could have been long
[53:55] held traditions and remember where we
[53:57] set today there's a lot of things that
[53:59] become a part of our mythology
[54:02] and we think america was founded with
[54:04] the slogan in god we trust it's been on
[54:07] the dollar bill since the day this
[54:09] country was founded
[54:12] you might want to look that up buddy
[54:15] right until the 50s
[54:17] you realize the pledge of allegiance was
[54:19] largely secular until the 1950s
[54:21] one nation
[54:23] indivisible
[54:24] with truth
[54:25] justice liberty what is it again you
[54:27] know the thing
[54:29] brock a card off
[54:31] confess whatever it is you know you know
[54:33] the thing
[54:35] it it it was it was that was the pledge
[54:37] of allegiance until the 1950s with this
[54:39] upswing of political activism within
[54:41] evangelism they added one nation
[54:45] under god
[54:46] right
[54:47] this was added later and in our minds we
[54:50] think my goodness we've always been a
[54:52] nation
[54:53] that put this thing on our dollar bill
[54:55] put this on our money and put this in
[54:56] our pledge of allegiance no it was
[54:58] something new
[55:01] it was it might have been
[55:03] a as a as a pushback against communism
[55:06] it might you look back at the things
[55:08] that were upswelling in motivating
[55:10] people at the time do christians need to
[55:12] have in god we trust on their dollar
[55:14] bill to feel that they're right
[55:16] do we need to be in a nation that's
[55:18] money
[55:19] it gives knowledge he recognizes god
[55:21] listen let him take in one nation under
[55:24] god of the pledge of allegiance it
[55:26] doesn't take any of my devotion to
[55:27] christ away i'm sorry if i'm starting to
[55:30] really get onto some of your your pet
[55:31] peeves when it comes to politics and
[55:33] your identity as an american christian
[55:35] but i would much rather just be a
[55:37] christian than anywhere
[55:40] i don't need to be an american christian
[55:42] i don't need in god we trust on the
[55:44] dollar bill she's lost she can put god
[55:46] on everything doesn't make her more
[55:47] christian
[55:52] anyways it was constatine
[55:55] that deliberately began to take these
[55:57] different pagan festivals and
[55:59] christianizing oh you guys celebrate
[56:01] this planet let's make that a festival
[56:04] to this martyr oh you guys celebrate
[56:05] this let's make this a festival to this
[56:07] saint and they begin to tear down the
[56:08] statues of greek uh greek mythology and
[56:11] others religion other religions and
[56:13] egypt and all over these babylonian gods
[56:15] and begin to put christian symbols in
[56:17] their place
[56:19] it was no longer the worship of some
[56:21] venus or some
[56:22] planetary
[56:24] god in the sky but it becomes the
[56:25] worship of a woman upon earth
[56:28] and then pope gregory
[56:31] very simple name
[56:33] old pope greg
[56:35] uh
[56:36] it was gregory the great rather so it
[56:38] wasn't just you know greg the great it
[56:40] was gregory the great he actually
[56:42] explicitly
[56:44] pronounced even in the extended kingdoms
[56:46] as it began to reach into the united
[56:48] kingdom and other regions of europe he
[56:50] specifically pronounced the commandment
[56:52] to not tear down pagan places of worship
[56:55] and these pagan temples and these pagan
[56:57] areas but to convert them into places of
[56:59] christian worship
[57:01] and he actually
[57:02] recommended explicitly recommended that
[57:04] pagan festivals be converted to a feast
[57:06] for martyrs
[57:07] so if they were celebrating a feast to
[57:09] jupiter you would change it and turn it
[57:10] into a feast of one that was a martyr
[57:13] for the cause of christ so i want you to
[57:15] recognize how it's the roman church now
[57:16] the catholic church that begins to
[57:18] intentionally take pagan symbolism
[57:22] and blend it in with christian practices
[57:25] brother ben says in the church age book
[57:27] as he writes now notice that constatine
[57:28] gave special feasts to the people they
[57:31] were the old pagan feast with new names
[57:33] taken from the church or in some cases
[57:36] christian rights were taken and abused
[57:38] with pagan ceremonies
[57:41] he took the worship of the sun god and
[57:42] changed it to the son of god
[57:45] instead of celebrating on december 21st
[57:47] which is when they used to celebrate the
[57:48] feast of the sun god
[57:50] they put it
[57:51] up to december 25th and called it the
[57:54] son of god's birthday
[57:57] and this is this is brother branham now
[57:58] recognizing this and you find that
[58:00] brother branham gives this
[58:03] credence too and i'm so grateful i could
[58:05] say this with just
[58:07] absolute perfect
[58:09] confidence and peace i'm so thankful for
[58:10] the message of the hour
[58:12] to shine light and give a balance
[58:15] because if you want to go figure this
[58:16] out on your own
[58:18] have fun
[58:20] have fun but i'm so glad the message of
[58:22] the hour kind of begins to steer us and
[58:24] highlight things and the holy spirit can
[58:26] help keep a balance in the word of god
[58:28] so i did brother branham is now
[58:30] identifying this shift and how
[58:31] constantine now
[58:33] takes this
[58:34] uh these few hundred years later and it
[58:36] begins to crystallize within the frame
[58:38] of christianity this blending in of
[58:41] paganism
[58:43] with christian ideas and christian
[58:45] thoughts
[58:47] and i i'll say this that the use of
[58:50] december 25th as the actual date of
[58:52] christ's birth or the date that
[58:53] christians are going to celebrate
[58:54] christ's birth may have started
[58:56] innocently
[58:58] but once the church begins to blend in
[59:01] this paganism and the church the roman
[59:03] church begins to
[59:04] take constantine takes these feasts and
[59:06] all these other elements begin to be
[59:07] added in it begins to pervert and
[59:09] confuse any truth that may have existed
[59:12] with respect to this honoring christ's
[59:14] birthday
[59:17] this this is something i know i'm
[59:18] stating the obvious but think about this
[59:21] there is a truth to the birth of christ
[59:23] we believe that christ was actually born
[59:26] and so there is a truth to the birth of
[59:28] christ that satan would love to obscure
[59:32] there's something symbolic in it there's
[59:34] something represented there's something
[59:35] literal that's taking place there's
[59:36] prophecies being fulfilled and satan
[59:38] would love to take the truth of
[59:40] christmas and obscure it and hide it
[59:42] with mythology so you have so many
[59:44] christmas myths you don't recognize the
[59:46] christmas mystery
[59:50] and all elements
[59:54] of christianity
[59:55] when you think about the pomp the
[59:57] circumstance the religion the theology
[59:59] in christendom today almost all elements
[1:00:01] of christianity let alone christmas have
[1:00:03] become wrapped up and hid behind so much
[1:00:05] it's not just christmas but it's
[1:00:06] religion period it's christianity period
[1:00:09] it's worship it's doctrine it's been
[1:00:11] wrapped and hid behind so much
[1:00:14] and we have to be careful
[1:00:17] that we don't let the
[1:00:19] pagan myths
[1:00:20] push us away from the christian truth
[1:00:25] if you wanted to start pinpointing
[1:00:29] paganism being blended with christianity
[1:00:32] you come up with a metric by which
[1:00:34] you're going to choose to reject and
[1:00:36] accept
[1:00:37] eventually you'd do away with
[1:00:39] christianity
[1:00:40] because the catholic church has so
[1:00:43] swallowed it up and turned it into
[1:00:46] idolatry
[1:00:47] that you would have to walk away from
[1:00:49] all of it if you were going to do it for
[1:00:50] the sake of staying away from
[1:00:52] catholicism
[1:00:54] you'd have to walk away from all that
[1:00:55] for the sake of saying i don't want to
[1:00:56] be stained with not even one ounce or
[1:00:58] one iota if anything that has some sort
[1:01:00] of pagan connection why because the
[1:01:03] truth has been perverted by the devil
[1:01:05] so the truth in some way
[1:01:07] is it has this lie near it mimicking it
[1:01:10] taunting it standing against it
[1:01:15] and so we have to be careful that myths
[1:01:16] don't push us away from truth not not
[1:01:18] that we would say christ was born in
[1:01:20] december
[1:01:21] but to be careful that we don't adopt
[1:01:23] certain principles and beliefs that
[1:01:25] cause us to be distracted from truth
[1:01:29] if i could say this and i i know again
[1:01:31] i'm going to be a little bit lengthy
[1:01:32] this morning
[1:01:35] at this point i know been right at an
[1:01:36] hour but let me say this because i want
[1:01:39] to read some things continue to read
[1:01:40] some things when the word exposes
[1:01:43] when the word of god is very clear about
[1:01:45] a pagan perversion brother about him
[1:01:46] right here thomas constantine just
[1:01:48] blending in christian things being
[1:01:50] blended in with pagan things december
[1:01:52] 25th kind of being moved to where it's
[1:01:54] soul invictus it's a celebrating of the
[1:01:56] sun god's birthday and not the son of
[1:01:58] god
[1:01:59] and it's kind of changed into the son of
[1:02:01] god's birthday and now the soul invictus
[1:02:03] is being blended in with christmas and
[1:02:05] these things begin to have this
[1:02:06] pronounced uh uh we know we can clearly
[1:02:09] see it when the word of god exposes this
[1:02:12] pagan affront this pagan perversion when
[1:02:15] the word exposes an air recognized it
[1:02:18] also reveals the truth
[1:02:22] that there's something that is going to
[1:02:24] help give us the balance because if all
[1:02:26] this gets torn down and truth isn't
[1:02:28] being highlighted then once that's
[1:02:29] kicked out we could just get thrown all
[1:02:31] the way to another side and we don't
[1:02:32] maintain a balance so the word when it
[1:02:34] exposes a rut it exposes multiple ruts
[1:02:38] often so that we can stay right in the
[1:02:39] perfect balance
[1:02:41] the devil is shrewd
[1:02:43] satan has been working on this agenda
[1:02:45] for 6 000 years even in heaven when it
[1:02:47] all be the rebellion began you have to
[1:02:49] recognize the shrewdness and the
[1:02:50] subtlety where satan knows if you can
[1:02:52] just pull put a stain or a stigma on the
[1:02:55] word of god it can keep people from
[1:02:57] coming to it
[1:02:59] just put a stain on it just put a stigma
[1:03:01] on it just try to find some way to to to
[1:03:05] make it controversial the radicalization
[1:03:07] myth for all of a sudden if you put this
[1:03:09] scarlet letter on it people like i don't
[1:03:11] have anything to do i don't know if i
[1:03:12] want to have anything to do with it and
[1:03:14] in doing so here he is the scarecrow
[1:03:15] trying to keep you away from the true
[1:03:16] thing
[1:03:17] you realize he does that to the open of
[1:03:20] the word
[1:03:21] he does that to whether or not certain
[1:03:23] scriptures were fulfilled by the message
[1:03:24] of the hour he does it to try to create
[1:03:26] there's certain things that the devil
[1:03:27] tries to do to try to keep you from
[1:03:28] believing the truth
[1:03:31] as we mentioned before about the
[1:03:32] parallels to easter
[1:03:34] there's a lot of easter myths
[1:03:37] there's
[1:03:38] a lot of easter myth many legends
[1:03:42] a lot of the
[1:03:43] legends and the elements that exist
[1:03:45] around the easter time are not even
[1:03:48] ancient traditions but things that were
[1:03:50] adopted in more modern times the last
[1:03:52] several hundred years
[1:03:53] like even with respect to rabbits and
[1:03:55] eggs these are things that yeah you find
[1:03:57] symbolism in other religions but its
[1:03:59] place and its part in easter
[1:04:01] celebrations are things that would be
[1:04:02] more recent as opposed to this is what
[1:04:05] they did but nimrod you know had an
[1:04:07] easter egg hunt
[1:04:09] at the time of the passover those things
[1:04:11] weren't happening then
[1:04:13] so but you do see the connections in the
[1:04:14] different parts it's not easter i know
[1:04:17] one of the myths is that easter is some
[1:04:19] sort of congregation or mispronunciation
[1:04:22] of ishtar or astarte or asteroth
[1:04:24] and you'll find that
[1:04:26] according to even in the word of god and
[1:04:28] even as you look at it historically that
[1:04:30] easter as far as a term is not directly
[1:04:34] the same word as ishtar astarte they're
[1:04:37] actually two different things
[1:04:40] the word easter it would be a germanic
[1:04:42] word there's ostra or yoster
[1:04:45] and it was which we believe to be and we
[1:04:47] recognize that there's a lot of evidence
[1:04:49] to back this up a fertility goddess
[1:04:52] the goddess of the spring the spring
[1:04:54] goddess and it's in german mythology
[1:04:56] that you find this yoster this austra
[1:04:59] this is the this is where you find the
[1:05:01] term that would be germanic if you put
[1:05:03] it in the anglo-saxon or english it'd be
[1:05:04] easter
[1:05:06] and she was the goddess of the dawn she
[1:05:08] was the bringer of light this is what
[1:05:09] she represented within within german
[1:05:12] mythology
[1:05:13] and it has german origins like this is
[1:05:16] where yoster easter comes it comes up
[1:05:18] within the german mythology and it's
[1:05:20] associated later with anglo-saxon
[1:05:22] mythology and this is after the birth of
[1:05:24] the church
[1:05:26] that this easter and this terminology
[1:05:27] and these words begin to be used but
[1:05:29] then you can trace it back in what it
[1:05:31] represents you could trace it back that
[1:05:34] her mythology originated in what the
[1:05:36] mysteries of babylon
[1:05:38] because in the mistress of babylon you
[1:05:41] see every religion in the world whatever
[1:05:44] hemisphere wherever you are you can
[1:05:46] always trace it back to the seeds that
[1:05:48] are sold in babylon so if there's a
[1:05:50] yoster in germany you can trace it back
[1:05:53] to enough to see that there's some way
[1:05:56] somehow that this false image and false
[1:05:59] idea began with polytheism after the
[1:06:02] flood when man got away from god
[1:06:05] man had always worshipped the true god
[1:06:07] and stayed true to god you would never
[1:06:08] need a goddess of fertility
[1:06:12] you would never worship venus you would
[1:06:13] never worship the moon you would never
[1:06:15] need to worship mythological characters
[1:06:17] so yes this is traced back to the
[1:06:19] mysteries of babylon
[1:06:21] and that's where that's the origin of
[1:06:24] the term easter
[1:06:26] but yet even before you find the term
[1:06:28] easter being used or even the origin of
[1:06:31] this german mythology yoster early
[1:06:34] christians celebrated the resurrection
[1:06:37] in other languages outside of uh
[1:06:40] german and and i think even within
[1:06:42] german they don't use the word easter
[1:06:43] for the celebration of
[1:06:45] what we call easter but it's pasca
[1:06:47] or some derivative of that word is the
[1:06:49] word that's used in other languages
[1:06:52] around the world they use a different
[1:06:54] word which is passover or paschal pascal
[1:06:56] lamb it's recognizing the resurrection
[1:06:59] of christ who was the lamb and they used
[1:07:01] the terminology of pasca or passover and
[1:07:04] early christians we say celebrated or
[1:07:06] honored or had a time where they
[1:07:08] recognized the resurrection
[1:07:11] polycarp did irenaeus did in their
[1:07:14] writings they're drawing it from even
[1:07:16] the practice and as they were taught by
[1:07:18] john to set aside and to honor this time
[1:07:21] this annual tradition of celebrating the
[1:07:23] resurrection and so the actual practice
[1:07:26] of recognizing the resurrection of jesus
[1:07:28] christ within the christian church had
[1:07:30] zero pagan connections
[1:07:34] are you still with me
[1:07:35] 11 35
[1:07:39] but if you found conflict within the
[1:07:41] early christian church about easter as
[1:07:44] we might call it now or the passover the
[1:07:46] celebration of the resurrection the
[1:07:47] conflict was over whether or not they
[1:07:49] were blending in jewish feast which was
[1:07:51] obviously the passover with and jewish
[1:07:53] feasts and customs with our christian
[1:07:56] celebration
[1:07:57] the christians are now doing something
[1:07:59] to honor the resurrection because they
[1:08:00] believed it was during this time of the
[1:08:02] feast of the passover that christ was
[1:08:03] not only crucified and had that last
[1:08:06] meal with his disciples but he rose
[1:08:07] again on the third day in that time of
[1:08:10] the feast of the passover and so
[1:08:11] christians are now recognizing this
[1:08:13] special time period in in its recency to
[1:08:16] them and as the church begin to unfold
[1:08:18] in the book of acts and with john who's
[1:08:20] a disciple of christ and polycarp who is
[1:08:22] a disciple of john an irenaeus who
[1:08:23] learned are these these the church age
[1:08:25] messenger these things begin to take
[1:08:27] hold within the christian church they
[1:08:29] had this consciousness to honor this
[1:08:31] particular time knowing it was then that
[1:08:33] christ was resurrected and so many days
[1:08:35] later was was when the holy ghost was
[1:08:37] poured out but it had the symmetry to
[1:08:40] jewish feasts
[1:08:41] so if there was a danger you'd be like
[1:08:43] well are we allowing are we allowing
[1:08:46] certain things
[1:08:47] with respect to
[1:08:49] uh jewish traditions in jewish feast are
[1:08:52] we using these things kind of as an
[1:08:53] excuse to kind of blend in
[1:08:56] so notice what was the ratio the idea
[1:08:58] wasn't judaism is not paganism
[1:09:01] right
[1:09:02] but it was just a former light
[1:09:05] and they were very careful this was the
[1:09:07] heartbeat if you could catch this this
[1:09:08] was the heartbeat of the early church
[1:09:10] they wanted to stay away from paganism
[1:09:12] they didn't want to have anything to do
[1:09:13] with it at all and they wanted to be
[1:09:15] very careful that they weren't just
[1:09:16] making it
[1:09:17] jewelry plus or judaism plus they wanted
[1:09:19] to be sure this was newness of life and
[1:09:21] they were honoring the lord and honoring
[1:09:23] his pre-honoring his precepts and they
[1:09:24] were wanting to walk in the truth so
[1:09:26] that's where the conflict came from
[1:09:30] it's not until
[1:09:31] the first roman church the first church
[1:09:34] at rome that became the seeds of the
[1:09:36] roman catholic church
[1:09:38] in the absence of the disciples that got
[1:09:40] kicked out through political pressure
[1:09:42] and government expulsion that they
[1:09:44] started bringing pagan elements or myths
[1:09:48] into these celebrations and obscured the
[1:09:49] truth
[1:09:52] it's not until later after the first
[1:09:54] this roman church after it's already
[1:09:55] show it's already shown in church
[1:09:56] history that they would honor the day of
[1:09:58] easter or the day of the resurrection
[1:10:01] and then the the first church at rome
[1:10:03] began to blend in these other practices
[1:10:05] and start to get obscure it's not until
[1:10:06] later
[1:10:08] that the anglo-saxon or german term
[1:10:10] easter and the ideas of easter
[1:10:13] begin to mix with the resurrection
[1:10:14] commemoration
[1:10:16] so it wouldn't even have been a word
[1:10:18] used
[1:10:20] by the disciples
[1:10:22] but the bible does mention easter in one
[1:10:24] place did you know that
[1:10:26] in one place is easter mentioned
[1:10:28] in acts chapter 12 it's speaking of
[1:10:30] peter when he was put into prison he had
[1:10:32] apprehended him he put him in prison and
[1:10:33] delivered him to four quaternions of
[1:10:36] soldiers to keep him intending after
[1:10:38] easter to bring him forth to the people
[1:10:42] the word that's used here easter is used
[1:10:44] 29 times in the new testament
[1:10:48] 28 times it's translated to passover
[1:10:51] and for some reason in the book of acts
[1:10:54] chapter 12 verse 4 pasca
[1:10:57] is translated to easter
[1:11:00] in verse 23 it references the jewish
[1:11:02] feast of the passover
[1:11:04] and
[1:11:06] in every single translation i could find
[1:11:09] from the earliest to some of the most
[1:11:10] recent this word is not easter is not
[1:11:13] used
[1:11:15] but passover is used
[1:11:17] i think well why in the world would this
[1:11:19] happen well the king james virgin
[1:11:22] version of it which that's another funny
[1:11:24] thing i knew people that thought it was
[1:11:26] blasphemous
[1:11:28] that lebron james went by king james
[1:11:31] because they had elevated
[1:11:34] a translation of the bible
[1:11:37] to be like a precious phrase like he
[1:11:40] calls himself king james i mean like
[1:11:42] that's blasphemous it's like no
[1:11:44] king james was actually a king of
[1:11:46] england who authorized the translation
[1:11:48] and we just
[1:11:50] never mind
[1:11:51] it's awful i agree
[1:11:55] but it was a
[1:11:56] king of england that authorizes english
[1:11:59] scribes to translate
[1:12:02] pasca
[1:12:03] and when they're doing that instead of
[1:12:05] using passover they used easter
[1:12:08] and that's the only place you'll find
[1:12:10] the use of easter so really as
[1:12:12] christians we cannot find any
[1:12:14] justification within the new testament
[1:12:17] to say well there's it's okay to
[1:12:18] celebrate easter use the phrase easter
[1:12:20] or try to make easter some sort of
[1:12:22] spiritual christian word that holds some
[1:12:24] sort of precious significance to us if
[1:12:26] we're all we're looking at is the bible
[1:12:28] only thing we have is that some king was
[1:12:30] using easter as a justification for not
[1:12:33] allowing him to come forth so it doesn't
[1:12:35] cause problems with the jews during a
[1:12:37] time of a passover
[1:12:39] but this is what i want you to catch
[1:12:40] this is the most important part if you
[1:12:42] stayed with me this long this is what i
[1:12:44] want you to get catch satan's pattern
[1:12:47] this is where you begin to catch satan's
[1:12:49] pattern not that king james and his uh
[1:12:52] his translators or shakespeare whoever
[1:12:54] it was cause you know intentionally
[1:12:56] meant to cause this problem but the
[1:12:58] devil's job is to cause confusion
[1:13:01] the devil has wanted to blend in mystery
[1:13:05] babylon he's wanted to blend in this
[1:13:08] paganism why in order to change the
[1:13:10] focus
[1:13:12] we're taught commonly if he can't get
[1:13:14] you out on the one he'll get you out on
[1:13:15] the other if he can't get you on the
[1:13:17] world he'll get you in religion if he
[1:13:19] can't get you on drugs he'll get in some
[1:13:22] sort of fanaticism as it relates to
[1:13:23] religion and religiosity so he wants to
[1:13:26] change the focus
[1:13:28] he wants to create the extremes so that
[1:13:30] once you've created the extremes and you
[1:13:31] develop the sides then no matter which
[1:13:33] one you join you're in imbalance and he
[1:13:35] doesn't care which side you're on just
[1:13:38] as long as you're beyond those barriers
[1:13:40] you're not in the liberty
[1:13:42] he wants to create the imbalance again
[1:13:44] i'm just trying to stimulate thinking so
[1:13:46] that we can be
[1:13:48] balanced
[1:13:58] don't even know what part i'm on anymore
[1:14:01] brother branham now gives this very
[1:14:02] direct notice this because think about
[1:14:04] it this is what i want you to consider
[1:14:06] then satan's pattern is the way he works
[1:14:09] when the venerable polycarp heard that
[1:14:10] the first chris christian church of rome
[1:14:13] and this is where i draw this and
[1:14:14] actually was able to find it exactly in
[1:14:16] history how the roman church started
[1:14:18] blending in these things even prior to
[1:14:20] some of these pronouncements by
[1:14:22] constantine when the venerable polycarp
[1:14:23] heard that the first christian church of
[1:14:25] rome was involved in pagan ceremonies
[1:14:27] that had corrupted the truth of the
[1:14:28] gospel
[1:14:30] so you have the truth of the gospel now
[1:14:32] paganism tries to corrupt it it's not
[1:14:33] that you have paganism first and then
[1:14:36] the truth you have truth subsequently
[1:14:38] perverted by paganism he went there to
[1:14:40] implore them to change he saw them
[1:14:42] prostrate themselves before images named
[1:14:43] after apostles and saints he saw them
[1:14:45] light candles and burn incense on the
[1:14:47] altar
[1:14:48] he saw them celebrate the passover under
[1:14:50] the name easter where they elevated the
[1:14:52] disc shaped bread
[1:14:54] that honored the sun god and then they
[1:14:56] poured the wine out as a libation to the
[1:14:58] gods notice how he's bringing in these
[1:15:00] elements
[1:15:02] of the disc shaped bread to honor the
[1:15:04] sun god
[1:15:06] paganism is being blended in after the
[1:15:08] fact it wasn't paganism to celebrate the
[1:15:12] lord's supper
[1:15:13] but symbolisms begin to be introduced
[1:15:15] into it
[1:15:16] it's actually at the council of nicaea
[1:15:19] that the catholic church or the council
[1:15:20] of nicea changed the date of easter
[1:15:24] and tied it to the spring equinox
[1:15:27] that's why now you don't the easter
[1:15:29] doesn't always fall on passover or
[1:15:31] didn't always fall on passover because
[1:15:33] now it was a time that was strictly
[1:15:35] affixed to the hebrew calendar their
[1:15:37] feast days
[1:15:38] it would have been fixed to their um
[1:15:42] to their schedule of feast
[1:15:44] and therefore you would think that
[1:15:46] easter
[1:15:47] being connected with the passover would
[1:15:48] begin to follow it but then once the
[1:15:50] church instituted when easter was
[1:15:52] celebrated it got out of sync until
[1:15:54] later the hebrew hebrew elders and
[1:15:56] traditions affixed a standardized date
[1:15:59] even to the passover so now sometimes
[1:16:00] you have more of an overlap but it's not
[1:16:02] until it's not it's the church that
[1:16:04] affects the actual date of easter the
[1:16:06] catholic church the council of nicaea
[1:16:07] did it
[1:16:09] bibraham said they took the feast of
[1:16:10] astarte and called it the easter
[1:16:12] celebration wherein the christian is
[1:16:14] supposed to celebrate he talks about
[1:16:15] this after constantine where the
[1:16:17] christians supposed to celebrate the
[1:16:18] death and resurrection of the lord
[1:16:20] actually it was a pagan feast to astarte
[1:16:24] this is what it had become
[1:16:26] they took the feast that we see
[1:16:27] explicitly recorded to astrothestarte
[1:16:29] the feast that were in jeremiah and
[1:16:31] these babylonian traditions things that
[1:16:32] were an abomination and stints to god
[1:16:35] they now become to get blended in and
[1:16:36] mixed babylon is becoming mixed with
[1:16:39] christianity and this is what it had
[1:16:41] become
[1:16:42] this the symmetry between pagan feast
[1:16:44] now being laid over the top or christian
[1:16:46] feast being laid over top of these uh
[1:16:49] pagan feasts what be a conscious effort
[1:16:51] to try to blend them and they did it as
[1:16:53] an idea to promote christianity
[1:16:55] like hmm
[1:16:56] we have all these pagans we have all
[1:16:58] these people that really really love
[1:17:00] hip-hop if we just made our service more
[1:17:04] hip-hoppy
[1:17:06] right we just made christianity more
[1:17:09] like these things maybe more people
[1:17:11] would come out constantine is the one
[1:17:12] that invented the modern bible church
[1:17:16] he's the one that started started the
[1:17:17] hipster christian movement let's be more
[1:17:20] like everyone else and maybe it'll win
[1:17:22] them to christianity
[1:17:25] does god ever change his mind about his
[1:17:27] word even i know a pentecostal preacher
[1:17:29] all them started now giving a round
[1:17:30] kosher which means asterisk the moon god
[1:17:33] a kosher wafer say shut your eyes and
[1:17:36] take it if it hurts your conscience shut
[1:17:38] your eyes around wafer what does it mean
[1:17:40] we are taking a broken body jesus christ
[1:17:43] broken showing the truth of the lord's
[1:17:44] supper not a round mood and god
[1:17:46] ashtrayth who mary took the place of and
[1:17:49] the roman kosher is still around for the
[1:17:51] moon goddess not god
[1:17:54] because of the god he's making sure that
[1:17:56] asteroth is the goddess notice what's
[1:17:58] happening
[1:17:59] subtle
[1:18:00] symbols of idolatry
[1:18:02] christianity now being blended in with
[1:18:05] idolatry
[1:18:07] this is happening with respect to easter
[1:18:09] this is happening with respect to the
[1:18:10] lord's supper all these things now
[1:18:12] taking shape and forcing themselves on
[1:18:16] into these christian
[1:18:18] truths
[1:18:19] not that it has to be celebrated or not
[1:18:21] that it was celebrated in the new
[1:18:22] testament but these are things that we
[1:18:24] would say do we come to church on easter
[1:18:27] do we celebrate the resurrection do we
[1:18:28] have easter sermons do we have these
[1:18:30] different traditions that we relate to
[1:18:32] easter and the term easter now may be
[1:18:34] special to us as christians but what
[1:18:35] does it commemorate the time of the
[1:18:37] passover and the resurrection the time
[1:18:38] of the paschal lamb being crucified and
[1:18:40] resurrecting that's what we're
[1:18:42] recognizing there's no spiritual
[1:18:43] significance to the word easter
[1:18:44] scripturally but there's something
[1:18:46] special about that time and that holiday
[1:18:48] to us as christians but what's happening
[1:18:50] is paganism is trying to swallow the
[1:18:52] truth of easter celebrations that's what
[1:18:54] we see brother branham identifying the
[1:18:55] time of the lord's supper the time of
[1:18:57] the resurrection now what does it become
[1:18:59] eggs
[1:19:00] rabbits
[1:19:01] pastels dress your best wear hats
[1:19:04] and it's almost become that's the time
[1:19:06] people go to church when christmas and
[1:19:08] easter
[1:19:09] wow because it would be pagan to not
[1:19:11] serve god 365 and think all you got to
[1:19:13] do is go a couple days of the year
[1:19:15] and check the box
[1:19:17] again i'm wanting to stimulate your
[1:19:18] minds to think about it
[1:19:20] even when it comes to our celebrating
[1:19:22] the resurrection the devil is trying to
[1:19:24] put a lot of paganism right up next to
[1:19:26] it even with respect to taking the bread
[1:19:29] and the wine the devil's trying to put a
[1:19:30] lot of paganism right up against what to
[1:19:33] devour and consume and swallow the truth
[1:19:36] of these things
[1:19:38] how many of you know that brother
[1:19:39] branham held a sunrise service for
[1:19:41] easter
[1:19:43] notice what the bible says about in
[1:19:44] ezekiel chapter eight versus not about
[1:19:46] it but about sunrise services maybe
[1:19:48] ezekiel chapter 8 verses 15 to 16 just
[1:19:50] trying to bring a balance stimulate your
[1:19:51] minds then said he unto me this is the
[1:19:53] lord speaking hath thou seen this o son
[1:19:55] of man turn thee yet again and thou
[1:19:57] shalt see greater abominations than
[1:19:59] these he'd seen a lot
[1:20:00] and he brought me into the inner court
[1:20:02] of the lord's house here he is in the
[1:20:03] inner court and behold at the door the
[1:20:05] temp of the lord between the porch and
[1:20:07] the altar about five and twenty men and
[1:20:09] their backs toward the temple lord in
[1:20:12] direct contradiction to what they ought
[1:20:13] to have been doing their backs to the
[1:20:15] temple lord and their faces toward the
[1:20:17] east
[1:20:19] and they worship the sun toward the east
[1:20:22] where they all got together before the
[1:20:24] sun rose in the house of the lord turn
[1:20:26] their backs to the true worship and
[1:20:27] affix their eyes to their horizon in
[1:20:29] order to worship the sun as it rose it's
[1:20:32] the only scriptural place i could find a
[1:20:34] sunrise service
[1:20:36] and god called it the greater
[1:20:37] abomination of these other things
[1:20:40] i've just given someone ammunition
[1:20:42] right
[1:20:43] to say that sunrise services
[1:20:46] are an abomination to god
[1:20:48] but do you realize god even connects
[1:20:50] that practice of going to the temple the
[1:20:52] lord before the sun rises and then
[1:20:54] turning your back to the temple in
[1:20:56] recognizing the rising of the sun and
[1:20:59] the resurrecting of the sun and this is
[1:21:01] what the men were doing they were
[1:21:02] venerating the sun
[1:21:04] instead of the altar
[1:21:07] and this this scripture here could
[1:21:09] actually be used to preach against
[1:21:11] sunrise services
[1:21:13] and guess what how did i find it
[1:21:16] because there's people that preach
[1:21:17] against sunrise services
[1:21:20] and because of their fanaticism i would
[1:21:23] have never noticed that in the scripture
[1:21:25] but they're out there
[1:21:26] pounding the pulpit and all these
[1:21:28] heathers
[1:21:30] that get up on easter morning and
[1:21:32] celebrate a sunrise service they're
[1:21:33] going to hell
[1:21:36] and this is the scripture they use
[1:21:38] and you know what you get caught up in
[1:21:39] that vein you say you know what it is it
[1:21:41] is pagan to do it and next thing you
[1:21:42] know your prophet
[1:21:44] is having pagan services on easter
[1:21:48] and and participating in idolatry
[1:21:51] not because because you've made the
[1:21:54] pagan part the truth of it
[1:21:58] you notice what you do you make the
[1:21:59] pagan part the truth of it when the
[1:22:01] pagan parts to obscure the truth of it
[1:22:06] the message identifies the paganisms of
[1:22:09] these holidays whether it be easter
[1:22:11] christmas
[1:22:13] not to destroy the entire concept itself
[1:22:16] but to separate out the lies
[1:22:20] it's not done so that the paganism
[1:22:22] becomes the truth in other words
[1:22:23] christmas is a pagan holiday so that we
[1:22:26] make that the truth christmas is pagan
[1:22:28] but rather he identifies the paganism
[1:22:31] associated with easter he identifies the
[1:22:33] paganism associated with christmas so
[1:22:35] that we can take the paganism and say
[1:22:37] you're the lie and punt it and stay with
[1:22:40] the truth of it
[1:22:42] you recognize what satan would want us
[1:22:44] to do put a scarlet letter on it so that
[1:22:46] we go oh i don't want that at all that's
[1:22:48] bad that's no good and walk away from it
[1:22:50] because there's a lot of foods that we
[1:22:52] would never eat if we never got past the
[1:22:53] skin if we never got past the the husk
[1:22:56] never got past the outside
[1:22:59] and that deters the consumption of it i
[1:23:01] believe the devil all times just tries
[1:23:02] to put up so many prickly so many things
[1:23:04] on the outside so we just get rid of the
[1:23:06] whole thing
[1:23:07] brother brahman the message harvest time
[1:23:09] he says and so did second eve meet hers
[1:23:11] at nicaea
[1:23:13] gave it a denomination creed
[1:23:16] accepted dogmas instead of the word
[1:23:18] taken down pagan idols like jupiter and
[1:23:21] so forth and put up paul and barnabas
[1:23:23] took down the sun god and the moon god
[1:23:24] astrath the moon god with round kosher
[1:23:27] on it and made her being the mother of
[1:23:28] the sun god which is jupiter in change
[1:23:31] the birthday of jesus from april we're
[1:23:33] all nature where he was born under the
[1:23:35] ram because he was a ram and change that
[1:23:37] up to the sun god's birthday and the
[1:23:39] solar there where it makes one day
[1:23:42] notice how brother branham is now giving
[1:23:44] credibility to to this identification of
[1:23:47] now how the idea of christmas gets
[1:23:49] cemented
[1:23:51] with this association and now it's been
[1:23:54] completely removed from any idea of when
[1:23:56] christ was born but now it's kind of a
[1:23:59] front the birth of christ is a front for
[1:24:02] these other religions and paganism that
[1:24:04] lurks behind it he said there's one
[1:24:05] minute difference in the day when it
[1:24:07] passes on the 25th of december the sun
[1:24:09] god's birthday not the son of god
[1:24:12] and every one of us play
[1:24:14] santa claus
[1:24:17] he said every one of us do
[1:24:20] every one of us play santa claus and
[1:24:22] decorate trees and heathenism and things
[1:24:24] like that and then call ourselves
[1:24:26] christians
[1:24:27] what's the matter with the christian
[1:24:29] church
[1:24:31] these are the statements we're familiar
[1:24:32] with right
[1:24:33] and there's several other similar strong
[1:24:37] if not stronger statements about
[1:24:39] christmas
[1:24:44] as he makes these stimulus there's one
[1:24:45] thing we can safely conclude those
[1:24:47] things have no place in the church
[1:24:51] santa claus decorating trees
[1:24:54] all these elements do not become the
[1:24:55] focus of a church
[1:24:57] all these things that the prophet is
[1:24:59] identifying is not to take even these
[1:25:02] things that are corrective and make them
[1:25:04] part of our canon making part of our
[1:25:05] belief making part of our doctrine but
[1:25:07] it's him trying to identify pitfalls the
[1:25:09] ruts the extremes the things that can
[1:25:12] distract us the things that have been
[1:25:13] blended into certain truths he's saying
[1:25:15] look at what these things are and it's
[1:25:17] very challenging this is a strong
[1:25:18] statement that i believe we ought to be
[1:25:19] confronted with playing santa claus
[1:25:21] decorating trees heathenism things like
[1:25:23] that and we call ourselves christians
[1:25:25] he's saying you call yourself a
[1:25:27] christian evaluate your practices what's
[1:25:30] the matter with the christian church why
[1:25:32] because even the christian denominations
[1:25:34] and christian churches were being
[1:25:35] consumed with those elements
[1:25:39] that's what it was becoming
[1:25:41] and it has no place in the church these
[1:25:43] things aren't part of our theology i
[1:25:45] would even say to the extent that we are
[1:25:46] recognizing these things during this
[1:25:48] time period where we'll talk about santa
[1:25:50] claus we'll talk about christmas trees
[1:25:51] we talk about the date that christ was
[1:25:53] born these things don't form our basis
[1:25:56] for belief
[1:25:58] like if we were witnessing the word of
[1:26:00] god we wouldn't say let me start with
[1:26:02] christmas
[1:26:06] once we see babylon once we see idolatry
[1:26:09] being mixed with christianity
[1:26:11] we don't reject christianity
[1:26:14] we don't reject the truth of it
[1:26:17] what day is today
[1:26:20] of
[1:26:22] is it what day of the week is it
[1:26:24] sunday what
[1:26:26] sunday
[1:26:28] s-u-n day
[1:26:31] we are gathering as a christian church
[1:26:33] on the day of the sun s-u-n
[1:26:36] a day which is derived from hellenistic
[1:26:38] astrology
[1:26:40] or days of the week you know we have um
[1:26:44] service on wednesday
[1:26:46] is it wode is that the god some norse
[1:26:49] god that it's named after
[1:26:51] so we have church on sunday s-u-n day
[1:26:54] and we have church on wednesday which is
[1:26:56] another roman name given to these
[1:26:58] different days of the week
[1:27:00] and those are that's when we're coming
[1:27:01] to church every sunday the day of the
[1:27:03] son the son of the sky
[1:27:05] we come to church
[1:27:07] now are we doing it to be different than
[1:27:09] the jews who set onto the sabbath is
[1:27:11] that why we do it like we don't want to
[1:27:13] be like the jews we don't want to mix
[1:27:14] our customs with jewish customs so in
[1:27:16] order to differentiate ourselves from
[1:27:18] the jews that celebrate the sabbath
[1:27:21] sabbath what we do is we're going to
[1:27:22] celebrate it on sunday and so we're just
[1:27:24] doing it to be different from the jews
[1:27:27] are we doing it because of its pagan
[1:27:28] origins
[1:27:30] i mean even in coming to church on
[1:27:31] sunday if we wanted to we could all bear
[1:27:34] the scarlet letter well i'm just doing a
[1:27:36] healer and thing
[1:27:38] right let's just be honest paganism is
[1:27:40] everywhere
[1:27:41] in everything
[1:27:46] we come on sunday to out of a
[1:27:48] representation to honor the resurrection
[1:27:50] according to scripture
[1:27:52] i don't think i need to get into the
[1:27:53] different things
[1:27:57] but we would come
[1:27:59] on the first day of the week which to us
[1:28:01] would be sunday and a lot of other uh
[1:28:03] nations
[1:28:04] or we we call the end of the weekend in
[1:28:06] the western hemisphere whereas in a lot
[1:28:07] of other nations it's actually the
[1:28:08] beginning week where sunday is the first
[1:28:10] day of the work week and it's go strong
[1:28:12] go hard
[1:28:13] but for us as christians we recognize
[1:28:15] this as a day of rest the day of the
[1:28:17] lord the day to honor the resurrection
[1:28:19] the lord was resurrected this is our
[1:28:21] our scriptural basis this is the day of
[1:28:23] the week that they would have gathered
[1:28:24] together this is what began in the early
[1:28:25] church they gathered on sundays to honor
[1:28:27] the resurrection and sunday became a day
[1:28:29] that was associated with christian
[1:28:30] service guests who made it official that
[1:28:33] this was the day it became an edict that
[1:28:35] sunday was the day for worship in church
[1:28:39] brother
[1:28:40] constatine is the one that made it an
[1:28:43] edict and formalized sunday services
[1:28:46] as when churches together
[1:28:49] so would it be wrong to have service on
[1:28:52] a saturday night
[1:28:54] would it be wrong to not have service on
[1:28:57] sunday morning
[1:28:59] would that would be would that be wrong
[1:29:01] because there's there's churches out
[1:29:02] there that don't even have a sunday
[1:29:03] morning service
[1:29:05] they have a sunday evening service but
[1:29:07] we get real legalistic we get real
[1:29:08] dogmatic and we get become radicalized
[1:29:10] and we would write somebody off because
[1:29:13] of what time they have church or where
[1:29:15] they have church
[1:29:17] right
[1:29:20] and the seventh day adventist said
[1:29:28] they'd say where am i why am i here
[1:29:34] we don't reject sunday
[1:29:36] as a day that we come to church
[1:29:38] should we direct easter because of the
[1:29:40] pagan myths and idolatry that are mixed
[1:29:41] in with it
[1:29:43] should we completely write it off
[1:29:45] completely reject it
[1:29:48] what do we do with it
[1:29:51] as a church we don't have easter egg
[1:29:52] hunts right
[1:29:54] we don't lay an egg on the altar
[1:29:57] we don't make a big to-do about easter
[1:30:00] and make it all about these elements of
[1:30:01] mythology those aren't the things that
[1:30:03] are promoting promoted but what does the
[1:30:05] christian church try to do honor the
[1:30:06] resurrection
[1:30:09] again i'm just wanting you to think what
[1:30:10] do we do we separate the traditions
[1:30:14] and the foundations that are contrary to
[1:30:16] truth
[1:30:18] we separate if that has a basis in this
[1:30:20] if that's your tradition that we
[1:30:21] separate so that we can see the truth of
[1:30:23] it understand the true significance of
[1:30:25] these days
[1:30:26] we do the same thing with christmas
[1:30:29] the controversies musicians if you'd
[1:30:30] come the controversies and the myths
[1:30:32] become a distraction from the truth
[1:30:36] and where something that the early
[1:30:37] church didn't even concern itself with
[1:30:39] with celebrating christmas let alone
[1:30:41] they didn't even really concern
[1:30:42] themselves of when he was actually born
[1:30:44] they weren't getting together debating
[1:30:45] well i think he was born on january 6. i
[1:30:48] don't know i think it was december 25th
[1:30:50] i think it was this i think it was that
[1:30:51] they didn't even have the debates they
[1:30:53] weren't even preoccupied by it
[1:30:56] it's not until later that it begins
[1:30:58] because it become a source of conflict
[1:31:00] why in order to cause division
[1:31:04] in order to polarize and pull people
[1:31:06] apart you celebrate the birth of christ
[1:31:08] on the 25th we celebrated on the 6th our
[1:31:10] church needs to split over the fact that
[1:31:12] you celebrate it 12 days earlier than we
[1:31:14] do and that becomes a bona fide point of
[1:31:17] contention that allows people to split
[1:31:19] and you don't even find it in the
[1:31:21] scripture
[1:31:23] we'll take things that are rooted in
[1:31:25] mythology
[1:31:27] and will take things
[1:31:29] that were intended to be a balancer
[1:31:32] intended to be a caution intended to
[1:31:34] take us away from paganism intended to
[1:31:36] take our focus off the wrong things and
[1:31:38] we take it and we weaponize that and we
[1:31:41] try to use it to demonize and tear down
[1:31:44] other people
[1:31:45] or try to make ourselves feel better
[1:31:46] about ourselves
[1:31:52] again
[1:31:54] i said this
[1:31:56] i say this whether or not one celebrates
[1:31:58] christmas would be a personal decision
[1:32:01] right
[1:32:02] when i say celebrate christmas in the
[1:32:04] manner which is customary for our
[1:32:06] country
[1:32:07] lights on the houses lights on palm
[1:32:09] trees
[1:32:10] a christmas tree
[1:32:13] this
[1:32:14] exchanging of gifts
[1:32:17] the festivities make baking cookies
[1:32:19] christmas cookies
[1:32:21] the cards
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:23] right everyone's gonna get
[1:32:25] you know shutterfly stock is just like
[1:32:28] through the roof right now
[1:32:30] because it's so easy now you know mail
[1:32:32] out the cars and everyone gets one and
[1:32:33] we do it because the season the time
[1:32:36] if there's a family
[1:32:38] that chooses to not hand out cards this
[1:32:40] time of year that's their decision
[1:32:44] and it doesn't mean they don't like you
[1:32:45] now if they hand it out to everybody
[1:32:46] else and not you
[1:32:49] maybe more it's more about you it's a yp
[1:32:52] your problem not their problem
[1:32:54] but there's no judgment in this
[1:32:58] people have different convictions
[1:33:00] and there's people who have a conviction
[1:33:01] that christmas is wonderful it's a
[1:33:03] favorite time of year and they enjoy
[1:33:05] things and they want to participate and
[1:33:07] they want to
[1:33:09] spend time with family and bake the
[1:33:10] cookies and make the house very festive
[1:33:12] and if somebody does that with as a as
[1:33:16] an own fam they want to do that
[1:33:19] you need to respect their personal
[1:33:21] decision to do that
[1:33:24] even if you feel that scripturally
[1:33:26] they're wrong or they're out of balance
[1:33:29] because you better keep the right
[1:33:30] balance
[1:33:31] because before you know it
[1:33:33] you'll use their christmas music to
[1:33:35] justify your worldly music
[1:33:39] well they do it in december so i guess
[1:33:41] it's okay if i do it the rest of the
[1:33:42] year
[1:33:44] and that's the danger
[1:33:47] because we start we start fixing value
[1:33:50] and putting people in this position
[1:33:51] these categories i'm just wanting us to
[1:33:53] be balanced this year but aaron where
[1:33:54] are we going to stand on this where are
[1:33:56] we going to stay on this let's not stand
[1:33:57] in the extremes
[1:33:59] as a church let's not put pressure from
[1:34:01] the pulpit on everybody you got to have
[1:34:03] a christmas tree
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:05] or you shouldn't have a christmas tree
[1:34:07] let it be a personal decision
[1:34:09] let people decide let them get into the
[1:34:11] word of god let them guide him let it
[1:34:13] leave them let it let it do something to
[1:34:14] kind of
[1:34:15] lift them up or
[1:34:18] challenge them in their own ways because
[1:34:20] people are different spectrums they're
[1:34:21] in different places
[1:34:23] i'll just say it
[1:34:26] maybe we need to be
[1:34:27] less
[1:34:29] frivolous
[1:34:30] less festive
[1:34:33] right maybe someone just maybe we get
[1:34:35] too much caught up into it and the word
[1:34:37] of god is saying hey
[1:34:39] you know taper it a little bit scale it
[1:34:41] down a little bit take a step back think
[1:34:42] about it again don't get caught up in
[1:34:44] these different things going into debt
[1:34:46] and the commercialization and the
[1:34:48] pressure listen i feel like i should
[1:34:50] take a whole series on the pressure that
[1:34:52] we feel to buy extended family gifts
[1:34:54] hard enough to buy for a family of six
[1:34:56] let alone a family of 60.
[1:34:59] you know and you got all these brothers
[1:35:00] aunts cousins sisters and extended
[1:35:02] families and then their kids started
[1:35:03] having kids like do i buy them for the
[1:35:05] second cousin's second cousins
[1:35:08] you know they did
[1:35:09] can i get a witness
[1:35:10] it's pressure
[1:35:12] because maybe you know we this year we
[1:35:14] need to be a little bit more prudent a
[1:35:15] little bit more
[1:35:18] this is the funniest funny part this
[1:35:20] year we're just going to write cards
[1:35:21] we're going to do something very very
[1:35:22] simple we're not going to exceed a 15
[1:35:24] budget and then
[1:35:26] week before christmas i went ahead and
[1:35:28] bought this i bought that i did this and
[1:35:30] it starts getting out of control what is
[1:35:31] it you start recognizing the pressures
[1:35:33] that are at work you start recognizing
[1:35:35] the the things that are taking place not
[1:35:37] because this is demonic this is this is
[1:35:39] of the devil and you're not even a
[1:35:40] christian if you're celebrating it you
[1:35:42] start to recognize distractions
[1:35:44] things that aren't expedient
[1:35:47] i can say this i want i kind of want to
[1:35:49] seed for where i'm wanting to go i think
[1:35:50] it's in part five
[1:35:52] or maybe part four
[1:35:55] that
[1:35:56] the message of the hour
[1:36:00] identifies the myths and removes them
[1:36:04] to make available to us the mystery
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:09] and the message it is the rising of the
[1:36:10] sun it's going to end on this brother
[1:36:12] braham says not on the sabbath the
[1:36:14] seventh day but on the first day
[1:36:16] which we call sunday s-u-n day course
[1:36:18] that's a roman word
[1:36:20] which they called it the sunday for the
[1:36:22] sun god
[1:36:24] but how it is changed
[1:36:26] it can change
[1:36:29] right
[1:36:30] even if you look at it in terms of when
[1:36:31] they instituted the roman calendar the
[1:36:34] day of the resurrection would have been
[1:36:36] a special day to christians later on
[1:36:38] it's called sunday s-u-n day when the
[1:36:40] roman calendar is formalized and now it
[1:36:42] kind of bears this mark it bears the
[1:36:44] stain and they could get lost in all the
[1:36:46] history all the tradition all the
[1:36:47] theology all the arguments all the
[1:36:48] pagans that can get lost but brother man
[1:36:50] says oh how it is changed it's not s-u-n
[1:36:54] anymore it's the s-o-n-d-a-y
[1:36:57] the sunday
[1:37:00] that the corn of wheat god's first one
[1:37:02] up from the dead is to be waived over
[1:37:04] the congregation that we are his seed
[1:37:06] and that's the first of the seed of
[1:37:08] those that slept waved over the first
[1:37:10] day of the week on sunday he raised up
[1:37:12] waved goodbye and ascended upon high in
[1:37:14] the presence of the people
[1:37:17] he says oh
[1:37:19] but oh how it is changed that would be
[1:37:22] my desire this this time of year that if
[1:37:25] there be anything that we see the wrong
[1:37:27] way if we're in one rut or in the other
[1:37:29] red whatever rut we find ourselves in
[1:37:32] all but how it is changed to the perfect
[1:37:35] liberty of christ so that now i'm not
[1:37:37] seeing it from a polar i'm not seeing it
[1:37:39] in opposites i'm not seeing it through
[1:37:40] the prism that the devil would want to
[1:37:42] place over whether i see paganism or i'm
[1:37:45] seen through paganism oh how i want it
[1:37:48] to change
[1:37:50] and i believe the message of the hour
[1:37:52] changes it all because of the message of
[1:37:55] the hour we can celebrate the
[1:37:56] resurrection without stigma because of
[1:37:58] the message of the hour we can properly
[1:38:00] honor this christmas time of worship
[1:38:03] without stigma without paganism there's
[1:38:05] a way that we could do it because oh
[1:38:07] yeah that has paganism oh yeah that's
[1:38:09] pagan oh yeah s you win day oh yeah
[1:38:11] december 25th oh yes soul invictus yes
[1:38:14] christmas tree yes tinsel yes this yes
[1:38:16] that but oh how it's changed
[1:38:21] because then he gets on in the next
[1:38:22] paragraph he says talks about the
[1:38:24] revealing of the son of man
[1:38:26] because he says it's s-o-n day
[1:38:29] waved over the people he says the son of
[1:38:30] man
[1:38:31] s-o-n is waved over the people again
[1:38:35] in this time
[1:38:37] the s-o-n is waved again he says oh it
[1:38:40] changed from sabbath to sunday it
[1:38:43] changed from a roman day paganism
[1:38:46] babylonianism whatever it might be back
[1:38:48] to the real truth of the day dawning let
[1:38:50] there be light the epiphany the shining
[1:38:53] forth of the sun it changed to the
[1:38:55] christians though you may have an easter
[1:38:57] though you may have an s-u-n day though
[1:39:00] you might have a christ mass associated
[1:39:02] with it oh how it changes from the
[1:39:05] idolatry and the paganism to the real
[1:39:07] truth of it
[1:39:09] why because the truth
[1:39:11] reveals the myth
[1:39:13] when he opens up
[1:39:14] to us the mystery
[1:39:17] merry christmas
[1:39:19] let's stand
