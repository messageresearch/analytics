[0:00] daniel chapter 10 i'm going to be
[0:02] reading
[0:03] in just a few places there
[0:06] and i just want to make reference to a
[0:08] few
[0:09] verses before we get to verse 10. but in
[0:12] daniel chapter 10 it tells us it's in
[0:14] the third year
[0:15] of the cyrus of cyrus the king of persia
[0:18] and then it mentions how he has been
[0:21] fasting and praying for three weeks and
[0:23] has a vision
[0:24] and then it's verse 10 it says and
[0:25] behold a hand touched me with
[0:28] which set me upon my knees and upon the
[0:30] palms of my hands
[0:32] and he said unto me daniel a man greatly
[0:35] beloved
[0:36] understand the words that i speak unto
[0:37] thee and stand upright
[0:39] for unto thee am i now sent
[0:42] and when he had spoken this word unto me
[0:44] i stood trembling
[0:45] then said he unto me fear not daniel for
[0:48] from the first day that thou didst set
[0:50] thine heart to understand
[0:52] and to chasten thyself before thy god
[0:54] thy words were heard
[0:55] and i am come for thy word so it's been
[0:57] three weeks the bible says
[0:59] fasting praying he says from the moment
[1:02] you begin this
[1:03] i was on my way it says verse 13 but the
[1:07] prince of the kingdom of persia
[1:08] withstood me one in
[1:09] 20 days but lo michael one of the chief
[1:12] princes came to help me
[1:14] and i remain there with the kings of
[1:15] persia and i am come to make thee
[1:18] understand what shall befall thy people
[1:20] in the latter days for yet the vision is
[1:22] for
[1:22] many days and when he had spoken such
[1:24] words unto me
[1:25] i set my face toward the ground and i
[1:27] became dumb behold one like the
[1:29] similitude of the sons of men
[1:31] touched my lips then i opened my mouth
[1:33] and spake and said unto him that stood
[1:34] before me
[1:35] o my lord by by the vision my sorrows
[1:39] are turned upon me
[1:40] and i have retained no strength for how
[1:43] can the servant of this lord talk with
[1:45] this my lord
[1:46] for as for me straightway they remaineth
[1:48] no strength in me
[1:49] neither is there breath left in me then
[1:52] there came again and touched me one like
[1:54] the appearance of a man and he
[1:55] strengthened me and said o man greatly
[1:57] beloved fear not
[1:58] peace be unto thee be strong yea be
[2:01] strong
[2:02] and when he hath spoken unto me i was
[2:04] strengthened and said
[2:05] let my lord speak for thou has
[2:07] strengthened me
[2:08] then he then said he knowest thou
[2:10] wherefore i come unto thee
[2:12] and now will i return to fight with the
[2:14] prince of persia
[2:15] and when i am gone forth lo the prince
[2:17] of gracia shall come
[2:18] but i will show thee that which is noted
[2:20] in the scripture of truth
[2:22] and there is none that holdeth with me
[2:24] in these things but michael
[2:25] your prince amen let's bow our heads in
[2:28] a word of prayer
[2:29] our gracious heavenly father we're happy
[2:31] to be gathered together today in your
[2:33] presence to see one another
[2:35] to have a gathering place that is full
[2:38] and the those that have occupied the
[2:40] space have hearts full of expectation
[2:43] people lord who love your word and have
[2:46] not merely out of habit made their way
[2:48] to the sanctuary today but
[2:50] there's something unique that's driving
[2:52] them and there's a hunger that they have
[2:53] deep within their hearts
[2:55] and father as we recognize just how
[2:57] precious this opportunity is
[2:59] we ask that you would come now lord and
[3:02] speak to our hearts we've appreciated
[3:04] the worship and just the beautiful
[3:06] presence that we felt
[3:07] in that now lord come take the bread of
[3:10] life and divide it to us
[3:11] may we in in reading it and hearing it
[3:14] lord
[3:14] receive understanding so we commit the
[3:17] reading of your word to you and all the
[3:18] things that if
[3:19] are upon my heart and my mind lord may
[3:21] you just grab a hold of it
[3:23] take control of it for your glory that
[3:25] your people may be benefited
[3:27] we ask this in the name of lord jesus
[3:28] christ amen
[3:30] you may be seated
[3:37] i'm going to continue on the subject of
[3:40] revelation resolves complication
[3:42] and we wednesday night we were speaking
[3:45] on wisdom from above
[3:47] and in doing that i never actually got
[3:49] to the place in james
[3:51] that i had really been pondering on how
[3:53] that the wisdom that is from above is
[3:54] first pure
[3:56] and there's a way that real godly wisdom
[3:58] exhibits
[3:59] manifest itself and it expresses itself
[4:01] in a particular nature
[4:03] and a particular character and i had not
[4:06] been able to get to that point
[4:08] i still want to be looking at that
[4:09] phrase and this subject of wisdom from
[4:11] above
[4:12] and i want to take last sunday and even
[4:14] this past wednesday here at the
[4:15] beginning and kind of
[4:16] weave them together and go further in
[4:19] something practical about
[4:21] wisdom and our focus has been the fact
[4:24] that life is complicated
[4:26] and how that we need revelation through
[4:28] revelation it resolves these
[4:29] complications
[4:30] and revelation is wisdom from god it's a
[4:33] divine
[4:34] insight something that god grants to us
[4:36] and we need this revelation
[4:38] not to survive laodicea but to to thrive
[4:41] and and live life well in the bright age
[4:43] and so it's something that's necessary
[4:46] uh for our living and to live life to
[4:48] the fullest and to
[4:49] navigate the labyrinth as brother
[4:51] branham tells us this laodicean age is
[4:53] it's a labyrinth it's a maze
[4:55] it's very confusing and there's twists
[4:57] and turns and dead ends
[4:58] we really need the leadership of the
[4:59] holy spirit to guide us
[5:01] and that's the mark of the son of god
[5:03] that's the mark of a daughter of god
[5:04] they that are the children of god
[5:06] are led by the spirit of god so we're
[5:09] wanting to yield more to this divine
[5:11] leadership
[5:11] so that we can kind of navigate the
[5:13] minefield that is laodicea
[5:15] and we've been looking at revelations
[5:17] chapter three and how that
[5:18] the the laodicean age and society at
[5:21] large
[5:21] expresses this ideal that they're rich
[5:23] we're increased with goods
[5:25] we have need of nothing we're well a
[5:28] tired and we've got all the things that
[5:29] we need
[5:30] but then god says you're actually poor
[5:32] blind miserable naked and wretched
[5:34] and you're ignorant you don't you
[5:35] haven't perceived your lacking you
[5:37] haven't perceived your poverty
[5:39] and so the very words that we've been
[5:42] reading about the laodicean age confu
[5:44] describes this confusing deceitful age
[5:48] we just look to the word and know this
[5:49] is the time that we're living in
[5:51] and this uh and i want to
[5:55] um say it in a way to where we're not
[5:57] just kind of resigned
[5:59] to whatever is going to happen the
[6:01] things that happen in the world today
[6:03] and things that take place we shouldn't
[6:04] just look at it as fate
[6:06] and that well that just happened and or
[6:08] just kind of karma or coincidence maybe
[6:10] even better word of what i'm trying to
[6:11] think about
[6:12] that there's things that happen and it's
[6:14] by design there's things that take place
[6:16] it's because there's certain thoughts
[6:17] and ideals behind it and so
[6:19] we want to think about this confusing
[6:21] age that we're living in this deceitful
[6:23] age that we're living in
[6:24] and not just kind of look at it like
[6:26] something's just been kind of thrown out
[6:27] there and
[6:28] however it falls out is how it falls out
[6:30] but that there's a way that we can live
[6:31] in this
[6:32] age being aware of what's what's trying
[6:34] to
[6:35] happen on god's side and what the
[6:37] devil's trying to accomplish on his side
[6:39] and in knowing what god wants to do we
[6:41] can make our way through this difficult
[6:42] age
[6:43] and this evil age is a consuming age and
[6:46] we touched on that quite a bit
[6:48] last sunday how it's trying to swallow
[6:49] us up trying to choke out the word
[6:51] the word the deceitfulness of riches the
[6:54] cares of this life and
[6:55] the lust of other things entering in
[6:57] fight against the power of the word of
[6:59] god that's in that seed that all of you
[7:01] possess
[7:02] and so there's a power that's trying to
[7:04] steal our joy there's a power that's
[7:06] trying to take away from us
[7:07] our peace and in first peter chapter 5
[7:10] verse 8 it says be sober
[7:12] be vigilant because your adversary the
[7:14] devil as a royal
[7:16] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[7:19] devour i really want you to ponder that
[7:21] it's first peter i kind of dropped the
[7:23] the first part there but i really want
[7:25] you to ponder this
[7:26] this is a reality this is an allegory
[7:29] this isn't a
[7:30] merely an analogy or just try to explain
[7:32] life is hard and we always have things
[7:34] that come up against us
[7:35] peter's actually saying that the devil
[7:38] is
[7:38] a malicious and the devil is very intent
[7:40] to say that he says walketh about
[7:42] he makes due use of every opportunity
[7:45] what
[7:46] seeking whom he may devour seeking to
[7:49] swallow you up seeking to consume you so
[7:51] the age isn't an innocent age and
[7:54] there's forces at work and that's really
[7:56] kind of what forms the foundation that
[7:58] i'm trying to express right now
[7:59] there's forces at work in the age that
[8:01] we're living in that are set against you
[8:04] and and we we should believe this very
[8:07] literally
[8:08] that as the children of god and as the
[8:09] elect of god that there's forces that
[8:11] are set against us
[8:13] and this is our adversary he's the devil
[8:15] who wants to swallow us up who wants to
[8:17] consume us
[8:18] and wants to cause us to be so
[8:21] distracted and so taken by the things of
[8:23] this world
[8:24] that we're not yielding to the power of
[8:26] god which is present
[8:28] and we've been drawing from the end of
[8:29] the beginning and how in second
[8:31] corinthians chapter 11 verse 3
[8:33] paul said he feared that just as the
[8:35] serpent beguiled eve
[8:37] so would our minds be corrupted from the
[8:39] simplicity that is in christ
[8:42] in others we ought to have a singleness
[8:43] of heart towards christ we shouldn't be
[8:45] double-minded about the word of god we
[8:46] believe it
[8:47] we're all in and we believe the word of
[8:50] god we believe it to be true we believe
[8:51] our bible
[8:52] we believe this message and so we have
[8:54] this simplicity towards christ that we
[8:56] believe him we believe that he is we
[8:58] believe
[8:59] um that's what the scripture tells us
[9:01] about the messiah
[9:02] and he says i i fear that just as the
[9:05] serpent beguiled
[9:06] eve and changed her mind and changed her
[9:09] desire
[9:10] this is what satan would do to you so
[9:12] we're still fighting the same devil
[9:14] today
[9:14] we're in this laodicean age whatever
[9:16] existed then in the the church
[9:18] first church age has just gotten
[9:20] stronger it got stronger and stronger
[9:21] and stronger in the time we're living in
[9:23] now
[9:23] so he still has the intent to beguile us
[9:27] as it says in genesis chapter 3 verse 13
[9:30] when the woman is asked why did you
[9:32] do this she said the serpent beguiled me
[9:34] and i did eat i was deceived into acting
[9:38] he deceived me he tricked me he pulled
[9:40] one over on me he
[9:41] he made me think this is what you wanted
[9:43] he made me think this was the right
[9:44] thing to do and i was deceived into
[9:46] acting
[9:47] and the bible says in first timothy
[9:49] chapter 2 verse 14
[9:51] adam was not deceived but the woman
[9:53] being deceived was in the transgression
[9:56] and so when we pondered that we realized
[9:58] deception was at the heart of what
[10:00] caused the woman to sin
[10:02] that if there was a way out of the
[10:03] garden it began with deception
[10:06] as long as they were behind the word of
[10:08] god trusting to the word of god with the
[10:09] singleness of heart believing in the
[10:11] promise
[10:12] then they were protected against death
[10:15] they were protected against
[10:16] any kind of defilement but it says the
[10:18] woman being deceived that means misled
[10:20] by falsehood
[10:21] she was ensnared she was cheated the
[10:23] word actually refers to being cheated
[10:25] she was caused to believe something to
[10:27] be true that was actually a lie
[10:29] so this is satan's method of operation
[10:31] if the devil is at work today
[10:33] to try to create false appearances to
[10:35] try to make you believe something that's
[10:37] a lie or to entice you into something
[10:39] that looks good but is actually bad
[10:41] that's what satan is doing today it's
[10:43] what he did in the beginning
[10:44] it's what we're warned about in the
[10:45] bible it's what's happening right now
[10:49] it's deception that's how satan works he
[10:50] works in deception
[10:53] this is what our warfare in this last
[10:55] age is based upon it's based upon
[10:57] deception and unrighteousness is always
[10:59] accomplished through deception
[11:01] always accomplished through something
[11:03] that is a lie something that is a
[11:05] not the truth and because
[11:06] unrighteousness can't be accomplished
[11:07] through truth right
[11:09] so we realize that all unrighteousness
[11:11] is going to come through some sort of
[11:12] lie or
[11:13] some sort of perversion of the truth
[11:16] brother branham says sin
[11:17] through science and deception has
[11:19] twisted the whole human race
[11:22] sin and how has sin done it through
[11:24] science and deception
[11:25] has twisted the whole human race we take
[11:28] a step back and we look at how ungodly
[11:29] this world is and we look at
[11:31] what uh what drives people what makes
[11:34] them
[11:34] act what gets the preeminence and what
[11:36] dominates people's mind
[11:38] it's that way this is an evil sinful
[11:40] generation because
[11:42] of science and deception that's what's
[11:45] twisted and
[11:46] and molded the whole human race brother
[11:49] madam says in the message satan's eden
[11:52] he says here he is today he's talking
[11:54] about satan and his eden
[11:56] here he is today in deceit
[11:59] that treacherous hour that tremendous
[12:02] time
[12:02] that we are living in it's the most
[12:04] glorious time of all the ages because
[12:06] we're facing the great millennium again
[12:08] we're facing the eden but right at this
[12:11] age
[12:12] all the deceit and every tactic that
[12:14] he's ever used
[12:16] and been able to deceive with he's
[12:19] gathered it all together
[12:20] and reinforced himself everything he's
[12:24] ever used since the beginning he's
[12:25] gathered it all together
[12:26] say well he used this in the dark ages
[12:28] and he uses he used this in the gilded
[12:30] age and he used this back against
[12:32] israel and he used this against abraham
[12:34] and you go back through all that
[12:35] whatever he has used through all the
[12:37] ages and he's had great success in using
[12:39] it
[12:39] he has now accumulated it all together
[12:42] and now he's reinforcing himself in this
[12:44] last age
[12:45] with every treachery with every deceit
[12:47] with every lie
[12:48] everything he's been able to do every
[12:50] tactic he's now perfected and he's using
[12:53] it in the time that we're living in
[12:55] in one hand we can say well that's what
[12:57] explains why this world is as evil as it
[12:59] is
[13:00] because satan has perfected his tactics
[13:02] and satan has come to a place
[13:04] where he can deceive the whole world now
[13:06] that's one reason why it's where it is
[13:08] but brother brianna also tells us in the
[13:09] same message the reason why
[13:11] this evil age is how it is is so that
[13:14] you can
[13:14] god can prove that you're not like eve
[13:18] god's allowing it to get evil he's
[13:19] allowing satan six thousand years to
[13:21] perfect his eden
[13:22] so that god could defeat satan in his
[13:25] eden
[13:26] just as the devil thought he slipped
[13:28] into god's eden
[13:29] and defeated god's eden satan played
[13:31] right into god's hand
[13:33] but god wants satan to be defeated in
[13:35] this last days once he has achieved his
[13:37] perfection and
[13:38] and all his tactics have matured and he
[13:40] says they've all accumulated of
[13:41] everything he's used and been able to
[13:43] deceive with
[13:44] he's gathered it all together and
[13:45] reinforced himself that's the reality
[13:48] of the age we live in now i might
[13:51] uh through this begin to create maybe a
[13:53] little bit of fear or say man this is a
[13:55] really
[13:56] foreboding a sermon and this isn't very
[13:59] very
[13:59] very positive and i believe that we have
[14:02] a very positive message
[14:03] and so i'm being very positive about the
[14:05] deceit that's out there
[14:07] i'm certain of him very positive it's
[14:08] out there but i'm not
[14:10] i'm not going to take my time to express
[14:12] this to create any kind of fear
[14:14] it's good to know what's out there
[14:16] because there's a definitive
[14:18] agenda of satan today in other words
[14:20] satan has a definite agenda he has
[14:22] something that he's wanting to do
[14:24] and so there are spirits that are at
[14:25] work there are
[14:27] powers that are out there that oppose
[14:30] truth there's a
[14:30] here's a very specific agenda we could
[14:33] say that god has a very specific intent
[14:35] and it's pouring down his spirit
[14:37] what's his purpose in pouring out the
[14:39] spirit we realize
[14:40] that god wants to pour out his spirit so
[14:42] that it can work upon the elect to bring
[14:44] them to a birth and to mature them into
[14:46] adoption
[14:47] that that's the very specific purpose of
[14:49] the word and the move of god
[14:51] but there's a lot of people that benefit
[14:53] generally from it
[14:54] and we don't begrudge that we rejoice in
[14:56] it if if your neighbor
[14:58] who's a a libertarian an episcopalian
[15:00] and
[15:01] and they testified that they prayed and
[15:02] god healed their heart or god restored
[15:04] their
[15:05] uh they had a crippled toe or something
[15:06] like that we shouldn't be skeptical
[15:09] who is it that heals our god heals the
[15:12] spirit of god can be poured out and
[15:13] people can manifest signs and wonders
[15:15] and miracles
[15:16] and we can see certain things that take
[15:18] place and we don't have to doubt and be
[15:20] skeptical if somebody was raised from
[15:21] the dead we say well
[15:22] if somebody raised them from the dead
[15:24] there's only one that can do that
[15:26] and that's my god and so there's things
[15:28] that can happen in a general outpouring
[15:30] of the word of god and a move of the
[15:32] spirit
[15:33] but his specific intent is for his
[15:35] bride's positional placing
[15:38] and the same thing we could say about
[15:40] satan there's a lot of things he tries
[15:41] to do and there's a lot of things he's
[15:42] doing and there's think people to get
[15:44] swept up in it
[15:45] but let's understand that his main goal
[15:47] and his main purpose
[15:48] is to short-circuit god's agenda to keep
[15:51] god's bride from ascending to the throne
[15:53] that satan covets that satan desires to
[15:55] have
[15:56] so there's a definitive agenda behind
[15:58] satan's working
[16:00] we identified the scriptures in 2nd
[16:01] corinthians 4 4 that says that
[16:03] satan is the god of this world brother
[16:06] brahm uses that language to call him the
[16:07] god
[16:08] of this evil age it's how he uses the
[16:10] phrase
[16:11] satan's eden in ephesians 2 2 he's
[16:14] called the prince of the power of the
[16:16] air now i'm going to be using the bible
[16:19] we believe the bible to be the word of
[16:21] god but the bible is practical
[16:24] the bible is applicable to where we are
[16:26] living so i'm not just trying to get
[16:28] religious and super spiritual
[16:29] and just learn a little bit about what
[16:31] our forefathers wrote but think very
[16:33] practically
[16:34] and don't think suspiciously don't think
[16:37] fearfully or don't see
[16:38] even try to be super spiritual about it
[16:39] just be very practical
[16:41] because we don't have to be suspicious
[16:42] and we don't have to be super spiritual
[16:45] and we don't have to be fearful we just
[16:46] want to look at this in a very practical
[16:48] way
[16:48] satan is the god of this world he's the
[16:50] god of this evil age he's the prince of
[16:52] the power of the air
[16:53] this is not mythology this is not just
[16:56] something to try to explain why bad
[16:58] things happen to good people this
[16:59] is not just a way of trying to explain
[17:01] why there's evil in the world
[17:03] there's a very definite agenda that
[17:04] satan has there's an evil that's in the
[17:06] world there's forces at work there's
[17:08] spirits that are at work
[17:09] and so the scriptures pull back the
[17:11] curtain on satan's agenda
[17:14] the scripture is telling us that he's
[17:15] the god of this world that he's the
[17:16] prince of the power of the air
[17:18] even the writers are saying the whole
[17:19] the john said that the antichrist
[17:21] that spirit is already at work within
[17:23] this within the church
[17:25] they were telling us that even if you
[17:26] can't see this person walking around
[17:29] causing problems he's there even though
[17:32] you can't see
[17:32] spirits that identify themselves as evil
[17:35] spirits and they have name tags hi i'm
[17:36] an evil spirit and i'm going to cause
[17:37] you to doubt today
[17:39] i better get used to me i'm going to be
[17:40] hanging around you don't see that
[17:42] but you experience a fear you experience
[17:44] a doubt you experience something that
[17:46] begins to attack you
[17:46] where's that coming from there's forces
[17:49] and powers that are at work that are
[17:51] unseen
[17:52] and as we read in daniel chapter 10 as
[17:54] it says this is the third year of cyrus
[17:56] the king of persia
[17:57] it identifies that there is a literal
[17:59] ruler in persia he's the king of persia
[18:02] you find that in verse 1 and daniel
[18:05] is praying and fasting for 21 days and
[18:08] he receives this vision and all his
[18:09] strength is gone from him
[18:11] and where we picked up let's just look
[18:13] at verse 13. i have a couple scriptures
[18:15] here highlighted on the slide
[18:17] it says now that daniel in this third
[18:20] year of the
[18:20] reign of cyrus he's the king of persons
[18:22] he's the literal one in the throne
[18:25] one comes to daniel and touches him and
[18:27] he senses this presence and this is an
[18:28] angel that comes to him
[18:30] and he's explaining why he had not shown
[18:33] up yet he's explaining why he had not
[18:35] arrived yet like
[18:36] why you've been praying for 21 days i've
[18:38] been seeking you i've been fasting i've
[18:40] been praying i've been
[18:41] i've been trying to find an answer from
[18:43] god
[18:44] and it's been three weeks before
[18:45] anything happens and now this angel that
[18:47] comes to daniel
[18:48] is going to give him a little bit of
[18:49] insight as to why it took him so long to
[18:51] come
[18:52] he says in verse daniel chapter 10 verse
[18:55] 13 but the prince of the kingdom of
[18:57] persia
[18:57] withstood me one in 21 days
[19:00] we heard you the very moment you begin
[19:02] to pray and i ca i was coming to your
[19:04] defense
[19:05] but as i was coming the prince of the
[19:08] kingdom of persia was withstood me now
[19:10] it's not the king of persia
[19:12] cyrus didn't meet the angel on the road
[19:13] and say whoa whoa whoa show me your
[19:15] papers
[19:15] all right this doesn't look right go to
[19:17] the side room we're going to have
[19:18] immigration talk to you for a while
[19:20] you have any luggage we need to have
[19:21] customs go through that and the angel
[19:23] got hung up on the border
[19:25] right that wasn't what happened this is
[19:27] in a spiritual realm
[19:28] the king of persia is cyrus he's the
[19:31] literal one that everyone would see he's
[19:32] the ruler on earth he's the natural
[19:34] leader
[19:35] but now an angel is wanting to come to
[19:37] minister to daniel
[19:38] and in a spiritual realm this angel says
[19:41] the prince of persia withstood me
[19:43] he's showing us that there was actually
[19:45] a spiritual power that stood behind
[19:48] the king of persia the prince of persia
[19:50] was one that was inspiring
[19:52] and anointing the king of persia he says
[19:54] he withstood me and michael one of the
[19:56] chief princes came to help me
[19:58] but i remained with the kings of persia
[20:00] he's fighting they're overcoming
[20:02] so there israel at the time
[20:05] is under the physical bondage to the
[20:08] persian kingdom in the natural according
[20:10] to the law according to even
[20:11] some of their geographical location so
[20:14] we can say in the natural they're under
[20:15] bondage to the king of persia
[20:17] and the kingdom of persia but now this
[20:19] verse tells us there's a spirit behind
[20:21] it
[20:23] this verse isn't just saying there's
[20:24] political powers and there's there's
[20:26] reasons why this happens and there's
[20:27] reasons why that happened
[20:28] and really when you begin to understand
[20:30] that there's supernatural evil powers
[20:32] that exist
[20:33] that inspire kingdoms and inspire men
[20:36] and that's the
[20:37] hidden agenda and those are the things
[20:39] that work that's why you can sit back
[20:40] and go my goodness do you notice there's
[20:42] the similar characteristics for
[20:43] thousands of years
[20:44] that motivate kingdoms that cause men to
[20:47] act and you can
[20:48] actually see a pattern and some people
[20:50] trying to make sense of that pattern
[20:51] think there's a cabal somewhere of men
[20:54] who are all related somehow by passing
[20:56] on of wealth and they get together and
[20:58] they meet with cloaks and they sacrifice
[21:00] babies
[21:01] and they're running the whole world
[21:02] they've been doing this for six thousand
[21:04] years
[21:04] right and and and you can see why people
[21:08] believe in those types of things
[21:09] because there is a common spirit that is
[21:12] inspiring
[21:12] and causing people to act and to behave
[21:15] now i'm not disavowing every secret
[21:17] society
[21:18] there may be ones and there's some i'm
[21:20] sure that exist and i could
[21:21] right now be on a list by mentioning it
[21:24] but we want to understand it doesn't
[21:26] matter what actually exists
[21:29] doesn't matter if there's people meeting
[21:31] in back rooms it doesn't matter people
[21:32] have dungeons and caves and secret
[21:34] neighborhoods and they
[21:35] they get together and they decide what's
[21:37] going to happen in the world and they
[21:38] accumulate their wealth and they're
[21:39] conspiring
[21:40] to subjugate people and to produce a new
[21:42] world order
[21:43] it doesn't matter what literally exists
[21:46] what really matters is the spirits that
[21:47] would be
[21:48] behind something like that not just evil
[21:50] men with evil purpose
[21:52] of themselves but there's forces and
[21:54] spirits that would be behind anyone that
[21:55] would want to do evil
[21:58] and so the bible is telling us that
[22:00] there's a spiritual world that's closely
[22:01] connected to the natural world
[22:03] the king of persia actually has a prince
[22:05] of persia behind them these are the
[22:07] hidden springs of nature these are the
[22:09] hidden springs of politics
[22:12] and in verse 20 this to me amplifies it
[22:15] all the more he says noah thou
[22:16] there wherefore i come unto thee and now
[22:18] will i return
[22:20] to fight with the prince of persia and
[22:23] when i'm gone forth lo the prince of
[22:25] gracious shall
[22:26] come what he has just said is i'm going
[22:29] to leave from you and i'm going back to
[22:30] fighting the spiritual power these
[22:31] angels these demonic forces the prince
[22:33] of persia
[22:34] but after i've gone and gone forth the
[22:36] prince of grecia will come
[22:38] and what happened later what happened
[22:40] shortly after that alexander the great
[22:42] he comes and he conquers persia
[22:45] this is the literal power that we see
[22:47] alexander the great but what's inspiring
[22:49] the bible's already told us the angel
[22:51] tells daniel
[22:53] that the prince of grecia is going to
[22:54] anoint alexander the great going to
[22:56] anoint a natural kingdom
[22:58] that's going to come and fight against
[22:59] persia and that's exactly what happened
[23:03] alexander the great comes and conquers
[23:05] persia but with the bible tell us
[23:06] there's an influence and there's a power
[23:08] behind it
[23:10] this reality of influences and powers
[23:12] that existed in the book of daniel the
[23:14] reality is the same today
[23:16] and we may not be worried about a red
[23:18] dawn and a communist nation coming and
[23:21] going through our streets and attacking
[23:23] the people and tearing us down and
[23:24] and causing us to all become communist
[23:26] and or or a natural kingdom coming as
[23:29] alexander the great would come and
[23:31] and overthrow a kingdom we're not
[23:32] worried about those type of dynamics
[23:34] necessarily
[23:35] but we realize these same forces exist
[23:37] in the world today
[23:39] what to overthrow god's program
[23:43] paul says in ephesians chapter 6 verses
[23:45] 11 to 12
[23:46] put on the whole armor of god that you
[23:48] may be able to stand
[23:50] against the wiles of the devil the
[23:52] cunning arts his deceit his trickery his
[23:54] craft
[23:55] the wiles of the devil is his devious
[23:58] influence
[23:59] so put on the whole armor of god the
[24:01] whole armor of god is to protect us
[24:03] against
[24:04] these demonic forces and this evil he
[24:06] says for we wrestle not against flesh
[24:08] and blood
[24:09] but against principalities against
[24:11] powers against the rulers
[24:13] of the darkness of this world against
[24:15] spiritual wickedness
[24:17] in high places this is what we wrestle
[24:20] against we wrestle not against flesh and
[24:21] blood
[24:22] but against principalities against
[24:24] powers against the rulers of the
[24:25] darkness of this world
[24:27] against spiritual wickedness in high
[24:29] places paul's placed our whole warfare
[24:31] not with natural people
[24:32] not with natural things and not with
[24:34] natural governments and natural armies
[24:36] but he said our warfare even if it would
[24:38] be contention with somebody in the flesh
[24:40] we've got to recognize there's spirits
[24:42] behind that that are motivating the
[24:44] situation
[24:46] we thought on a large scale they're
[24:47] spirits that motivate nations and
[24:49] kingdoms and there's powers and
[24:50] influences
[24:51] that influenced hitler and mussolini and
[24:53] eichmann these are demonic
[24:56] demons that are loosed upon the world
[24:58] and they're causing kingdoms and nations
[25:00] and politics and governments
[25:01] to do demonic evil things and that's on
[25:04] a large scale but it's real it's real
[25:06] for us on us on our individual scale
[25:10] and paul's not trying to create this
[25:11] fear in us like well there's
[25:13] you got to be afraid of of a dictator in
[25:15] vietnam and you better be afraid of the
[25:17] government in a one world order and be
[25:19] afraid of the pope and those things
[25:20] listen the reality is there's people all
[25:22] around us that can be motivated to do
[25:24] wrong
[25:25] there's circumstances and scenarios that
[25:27] are brewing and things that are taking
[25:28] place and happening and they're right
[25:30] around us
[25:32] things that can influence us and he's
[25:33] trying to he's wanting to open our minds
[25:35] up to this
[25:36] deceit that exists and where we ended on
[25:39] wednesday morning was james chapter
[25:41] excuse me wednesday evening i believe it
[25:43] was
[25:44] maybe it was wednesday or maybe it was
[25:45] sunday but we ended at one point in
[25:47] james chapter 1 verse 5. i think it was
[25:48] last sunday
[25:50] if any of you lack wisdom let them ask
[25:52] of god
[25:54] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[25:57] god that giveth all men
[25:58] liberally and upbraideth not and it
[26:00] shall be given
[26:02] him and the point we wanted to make with
[26:04] this before and i want to make it again
[26:06] it's wisdom for your circumstance
[26:08] it's not that you'd be the smartest guy
[26:10] in the room to know how to impress
[26:11] somebody it's not so that you could play
[26:13] the stock market it's not so that you
[26:14] can
[26:15] take advantage of something and you know
[26:17] as i think even brother branham was
[26:18] approached one time
[26:20] oh you know is there gold in them hills
[26:21] or is there oil over here
[26:23] that's not the kind of wisdom and
[26:24] discernment we need so that if somebody
[26:27] has
[26:27] buried some treasure lord show me the
[26:29] geolocation of where all this gold is
[26:31] that's not the wisdom that we really
[26:33] need
[26:35] it's a practical wisdom wisdom for your
[26:37] circumstance wisdom for the decision
[26:38] that you're facing
[26:40] and this is practical for living daily
[26:43] i want you to take this verse he says if
[26:45] any of you lack wisdom
[26:47] this is applicable if you're trying to
[26:49] make a decision about who you're going
[26:50] to marry
[26:51] ask god for wisdom but it's also
[26:52] applicable in a daily living just
[26:55] living daily there's things that are in
[26:58] the word of god we read it how should i
[26:59] be baptized well i don't think you need
[27:01] to read
[27:01] ask for wisdom it's very clear in this
[27:03] scripture how you should be baptized
[27:05] brother braham even writes and says it
[27:06] doesn't even take a revelation to know
[27:08] how to be baptized correctly to be
[27:09] baptized by immersion
[27:11] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[27:12] accept that by faith it's written in the
[27:14] bible
[27:15] and there's a lot of things that we can
[27:16] read in the bible say hey this seems
[27:18] very clear this seems very clear
[27:20] then there's other things that we could
[27:21] look at in the word of god in the bible
[27:23] and in the message
[27:24] and be like well what what what is the
[27:27] right thing to do in this situation
[27:29] i can kind of see the this side and that
[27:32] side and i can see where
[27:33] the picture's being built but there's a
[27:35] lot of gray areas sometimes
[27:38] anybody agree with that maybe i'm the
[27:40] only one living in the gray sometime
[27:43] maybe maybe i need to find out what you
[27:45] guys are doing
[27:46] i want to eat what you're eating for
[27:47] breakfast because i find in my life
[27:49] i'm asked questions i'm presented with
[27:51] scenarios i'm forced with making
[27:52] decisions and i'm like well i know what
[27:54] the bible says
[27:55] and i know what the message says and i
[27:58] don't know how they deal with this
[28:00] this is in the crack somewhere this is
[28:02] this is kind of like when sometimes when
[28:03] i go to start a song and i end up i'm
[28:05] not on any particular key and brother
[28:07] mike is like
[28:08] he's trying to find me i'm in the crack
[28:10] you'll never be able to find me
[28:12] and sometimes that's where we're living
[28:13] not on crack but we're living in these
[28:15] cracks we're living in the graves we
[28:17] we're not sure what is going on how does
[28:18] this apply or how does this fit what's
[28:20] the right thing to do
[28:21] and there's a lot of situations we find
[28:23] ourselves in and say well the bible
[28:24] doesn't really speak directly to how i
[28:26] should handle this family situation and
[28:28] i'm dealing with this estrangement or
[28:30] i'm going to take this job and how
[28:32] should i handle this and you could pour
[28:33] through the bible you could run all the
[28:35] searches you want
[28:36] in the message you find nothing directly
[28:38] speaks to this but you can have
[28:40] certain things that seem somewhat
[28:42] related somewhat tangent to it
[28:44] and what do you need lord i need wisdom
[28:47] i need to know how to make what seems
[28:49] very great to me right now i need to
[28:50] bring clarity i want to find
[28:52] if there is a bright line if there's
[28:54] some wisdom that can be
[28:55] laid to this situation that's the point
[28:57] we're trying to make
[28:58] is ask god for wisdom
[29:02] the bible says in second corinthians
[29:04] chapter 2 verse 11
[29:06] and the scenario that paul is
[29:08] referencing is the subject of
[29:10] forgiveness
[29:12] and he says forgive for my sake also
[29:15] because i don't want this person to be
[29:17] condemned and as you've forgiven them
[29:18] you are the ones that were supposed to
[29:20] forgive them
[29:20] but if you could convey to him that i
[29:22] forgive him as well
[29:24] and so think of that scenario let's just
[29:26] say you found out that there's a certain
[29:27] situation happened
[29:28] in a particular church and or in a
[29:30] family and and the family works it all
[29:32] out and everything's resolved and
[29:34] and then you have this wisdom to say you
[29:36] know what i want them to know
[29:38] i don't begrudge them i really wasn't
[29:40] necessarily involved or i wasn't the one
[29:42] i'm not the one that needed to forgive
[29:44] but i want to let them know that i
[29:46] forgive also
[29:47] this is wisdom paul is using wisdom in
[29:50] this scenario to say look i'm the one
[29:51] that rebuked the sin when i wrote the
[29:53] letter the last time and you guys have
[29:54] proven yourself and everything's clear
[29:56] but would you let him know
[29:57] he's good with me too because i don't
[29:59] want him to be overwhelmed with grief
[30:01] and always fear that
[30:02] paul hates me paul thinks i'm a sinner
[30:04] and so he exercised wisdom
[30:06] even though it might not be able to find
[30:08] anywhere where that would need to happen
[30:10] and sometimes i'll just say this
[30:12] especially maybe it's a problem with
[30:13] preachers is they're very very slow to
[30:15] say i'm sorry or admit they made a
[30:17] mistake or
[30:18] or say hey i forgive and there's a way
[30:21] that
[30:21] you can act in such a way to try to
[30:23] create this appearance you better fear
[30:25] me i'm a really really bad dude
[30:27] you better listen to me you better do
[30:28] what i want you to do i can make life
[30:30] miserable for you and paul said hey you
[30:31] know what let him know i forgive him
[30:33] i came on pretty heavy i came on really
[30:35] strong let him know he's clear with me
[30:37] and he's and he makes this statement
[30:40] unless satan should get an advantage of
[30:42] us
[30:43] paul did this in light of satan trying
[30:45] to find an advantage that means lest
[30:47] satan would defraud us or swindle us
[30:48] unless satan would take us by
[30:50] deceit satan would use a deliberate
[30:52] deception
[30:53] to secure an unfair advantage to use a
[30:55] deliberate deception
[30:57] to tear our brother down let him know
[30:59] that i forgive as you forgive lest satan
[31:00] could get an advantage of us
[31:02] and paul pulls back the curtain even
[31:03] more he says for we are not ignorant of
[31:05] his devices
[31:07] i'm not ignorant of his schemes i'm not
[31:08] ignorant of his specific aim and what
[31:10] he's trying to accomplish
[31:11] i'm not ignorant of how he'll use
[31:13] something for his own benefit
[31:15] i'm not ignorant of how he'll take
[31:17] somebody in their guilty conscience and
[31:18] take somebody in their sincerity
[31:20] and work them over and work them over
[31:21] and build a complex so i'm gonna act
[31:24] even though i may not be required to and
[31:26] even though
[31:26] i may not be asked to i have some wisdom
[31:29] about how satan works
[31:30] and he might even had wisdom about how
[31:32] this brother felt he says you know what
[31:33] i'm going to exercise some wisdom
[31:35] and i want you to extend forgiveness to
[31:37] him for me
[31:39] paul acted based upon satan's agenda
[31:42] and his wisdom about it paul acted based
[31:45] upon the very specifics of how the devil
[31:46] would work against this man
[31:48] and how paul could do something to
[31:50] remove a weapon that the devil could
[31:52] have
[31:52] paul did something affirmatively that
[31:55] would make the situation easier for that
[31:57] person
[31:59] and this is where we could make it very
[32:00] applicable as he's dealing with the
[32:02] subject of forgiveness
[32:04] paul is basically saying this is what's
[32:06] best in this situation
[32:07] i believe this is the right thing to do
[32:09] that i would forgive him also
[32:11] and this is how we can also ask
[32:13] ourselves what should i do
[32:14] what what should i do in this situation
[32:16] what's the right thing to do in this
[32:17] scenario and you might say well was that
[32:19] the right thing to do for paul
[32:21] you say well there wasn't a right or
[32:22] wrong it was the wise thing to do
[32:25] it was the best thing to do sometimes
[32:27] the things that's best doesn't mean it's
[32:29] more right it's just the best
[32:31] it's the best thing in that scenario
[32:32] it's the it's the best way to approach
[32:34] it what should i do
[32:35] and he says he acted because we are not
[32:38] ignorant
[32:39] of his devices to be not ignorant means
[32:42] we know
[32:43] we understand his tricks the very word
[32:46] says we're not ignorant we can
[32:47] perceive we are not mistaken so think
[32:51] about that
[32:52] he's saying that my ability to do the
[32:54] best thing in this situation and do
[32:55] what's right for this other person and
[32:57] even for paul's own sake
[32:59] is based upon knowledge and
[33:01] understanding of what was best
[33:03] the way that he should act was based
[33:05] upon his perception
[33:06] of satan's attempt to take advantage of
[33:09] a man and then
[33:10] what paul could do to ensure that that
[33:12] part isn't used in satan's agenda
[33:15] and so this wisdom that we're talking
[33:17] about from above it gives us perception
[33:20] and this perception is our protection
[33:24] let's look at proverbs chapter 2 verses
[33:25] 10 to 16.
[33:27] this wisdom that is from above it's for
[33:29] our perception and perceiving it gives
[33:31] us
[33:31] it protects our health it'll protect our
[33:33] wealth and i'm going to i want to use
[33:35] this
[33:36] phrase this lengthy reading here it's
[33:38] six verses it's not really
[33:39] that long but i want to use it so that
[33:42] you can
[33:43] um see one example in the scripture of
[33:47] how
[33:48] wisdom benefits us proverbs chapter 2
[33:51] verses 10 to 16 when wisdom entereth
[33:53] into thine heart and knowledge is
[33:55] pleasant unto thy soul when this is what
[33:56] you rejoice in this is what
[33:58] thrills you wisdom enters into your
[34:00] heart and this knowledge
[34:02] is agreeable to you and you accept it
[34:04] discretion shall preserve thee
[34:08] this prudence this sensitivity this
[34:10] awareness this discernment
[34:11] is going to keep you it's going to
[34:13] protect you and understanding shall keep
[34:15] thee
[34:16] so discernment discretion wisdom
[34:18] understanding and knowledge
[34:19] is for your protection in light of this
[34:22] evil age that we're living in the god of
[34:24] this world the prince of the power of
[34:25] the air these hidden springs that are at
[34:27] work in the world today
[34:28] this evil spirit that is upon leo to see
[34:30] it this definitive agenda
[34:32] that satan has in la and in in his eden
[34:35] here we are in a day of deceit and all
[34:37] his powers of trickery
[34:38] have accumulated up to where they are
[34:40] now and he's reinforcing himself with
[34:41] this
[34:42] how am i going to make it wisdom
[34:45] how am i going to make the right
[34:46] decisions revelation
[34:48] how am i going to be preserved how am i
[34:50] going to be kept by understanding and
[34:52] discretion
[34:53] to deliver thee from the way of the evil
[34:55] man what does it discretion and
[34:56] understanding
[34:57] from the man that speaketh forward
[34:59] things who leave the paths of
[35:00] uprightness to walk in the ways of
[35:02] darkness
[35:02] who rejoice to do evil and delight in
[35:04] the forwardness of the wicked
[35:06] whose ways are crooked and they're
[35:07] forward in their paths we could
[35:09] certainly make this a spiritual thing
[35:11] we could make it a a power of religious
[35:13] forces and false doctrine and being in
[35:16] bondage to
[35:17] false ideals and we could use it even in
[35:19] being in bondage to sin and how that we
[35:21] were addicted to things and and we were
[35:24] chasing after ungodly things and living
[35:25] a perverted life
[35:27] and we could see that there was a power
[35:28] that came and rescued for us from that
[35:31] but these same patterns exist as
[35:34] believers filled with the holy ghost
[35:36] there's still a way that we could take
[35:38] that displeases the lord
[35:40] there's still situations that we can
[35:42] find ourselves in that are detrimental
[35:44] to our spiritual health
[35:45] there's things that we can do that are
[35:46] bad for our physical health
[35:48] there's things that we could do that can
[35:49] cause problems in our families into
[35:51] strange particular relationships
[35:53] and so we want to make the right
[35:54] decisions
[35:56] maybe i could say this if your life
[35:58] wasn't complicated enough i'm probably
[36:00] going to make it even more complicated
[36:01] by showing you
[36:03] just how every day is just a maze and a
[36:05] web of little decisions
[36:07] that can make big impacts years later
[36:11] to think that one thing you said on
[36:12] facebook
[36:14] right would set things in motion to
[36:15] where now you don't even talk to your
[36:17] family anymore
[36:18] when you're written out of the will and
[36:21] you say well maybe
[36:22] it would have been nice to had some
[36:23] wisdom in that moment when i'm whether
[36:25] i'm going to let them know
[36:26] something right take that
[36:29] they blocked me what happened can you do
[36:31] that on facebook i don't know i don't
[36:32] have facebook
[36:33] full disclosure and just there's a
[36:36] moment of a decision i'm going to give
[36:38] them a piece of my mind i'm gonna give
[36:39] them a talking to
[36:40] i'm gonna i'm gonna do something and it
[36:41] has an impact
[36:43] and so there's a greater application
[36:45] there's an application i don't want to
[36:46] say greater there's an application of
[36:48] this when it comes to your salvation
[36:49] when it comes to deliverance from very
[36:51] major things
[36:51] but on a daily basis there's a way of a
[36:53] wicked there's a way that's not upright
[36:55] there's a way that displeases
[36:56] there's a way that's not expedient
[36:59] there's a way that's not conducive to
[37:01] what god's trying to accomplish in your
[37:02] life god's wanting to bring you to this
[37:04] place
[37:05] and you could take the long way or you
[37:06] could take his way
[37:08] you take the way that he wants you to go
[37:10] there's a way that we could
[37:12] there's a way that we could pass to get
[37:14] to where god wants us to be
[37:16] but if we don't take his way we won't be
[37:17] the person we should be when we get
[37:19] there
[37:21] because if god's wanting to bring you to
[37:22] a particular place he wants to produce a
[37:25] character in you
[37:26] that can be fruitful in that place that
[37:29] can be productive in that place
[37:31] and if you take a shortcut and you get
[37:33] there like well i'm where he wanted me
[37:34] to be i think he said well
[37:36] it's going to be harder than it should
[37:38] have been because you lack the character
[37:40] you lack the wisdom you lack the
[37:41] experience to be fruitful and to be
[37:42] productive immediately in that place
[37:45] this could relate to even marriage you
[37:46] may get the one that you believe said
[37:48] god wants you to marry
[37:49] and you may be with the one that you
[37:50] think is the right one but if you don't
[37:52] go about it god's way you can be where
[37:54] you're supposed to be but you can make
[37:56] it a lot harder than it's supposed to be
[37:58] you can make things more difficult you
[38:00] could complicate seasons and callings
[38:02] and relationships
[38:03] and you say well why didn't i think of
[38:04] this sooner and why did i do this then
[38:06] and i should have done this years ago
[38:08] listen if you would have done it years
[38:10] ago it might not have ever worked out
[38:11] the way it's working out now
[38:13] because god has a way god has a plan and
[38:16] so we need wisdom we need understanding
[38:18] we need revelation because if you're
[38:19] acting on that then you have no regrets
[38:22] well i know i made the right decision
[38:24] then and even though i'm coming back
[38:25] later now and doing something different
[38:27] this must be god's timing now because i
[38:30] feel the same leadership now as i did
[38:31] then
[38:32] and there's no regrets in that because
[38:34] it's wisdom that preserves you it's
[38:35] understanding that keeps things
[38:37] then it says in verse 16 to deliver thee
[38:39] from the strange woman even from the
[38:41] stranger which flattereth with her words
[38:43] and the book of proverbs is over and
[38:45] over and over again talks about the
[38:47] foolish and the unwise and the center
[38:50] and all these enticements and how this
[38:52] will try to get you and that will try to
[38:53] get you and this person will be calling
[38:54] you this
[38:55] strange woman said hey come over here
[38:57] enjoy this and these strange men
[38:58] even the bible is talking about how you
[39:00] know if sinners entice they consent they
[39:02] not they're gonna say hey come on let's
[39:03] go do this and
[39:04] hey join up with me in this hey put your
[39:05] money into this and hey do this and hey
[39:07] do that
[39:07] and let's all get together and this it
[39:09] talks about all these schemes and all
[39:11] these conspiracies and all these
[39:13] endeavors and all these acts
[39:14] of the world and what's the answer every
[39:16] single time wisdom
[39:19] wisdom is crying wisdom is saying wisdom
[39:22] is teaching wisdom is
[39:23] is caution in you in wisdom will deliver
[39:26] thee
[39:27] wisdom will keep thee wisdom will
[39:29] preserve thee
[39:31] the bible says in hosea chapter 4 verse
[39:33] 6
[39:35] my people are destroyed for lack of
[39:38] knowledge
[39:40] that's a heavy statement my people
[39:42] perish my people are destroyed
[39:44] for lack of knowledge the word knowledge
[39:46] there means perception
[39:48] discernment wisdom and understanding
[39:50] even translated differently in the old
[39:52] testament to these other words
[39:53] because of the lack of discernment
[39:55] because of the lack of wisdom because
[39:57] the lack of
[39:58] understanding of things my people are
[40:00] destroyed
[40:01] now this is a knowledge not in the sense
[40:03] of knowing facts or
[40:05] information but it's the understanding
[40:08] of them
[40:09] my people are destroyed for lack of
[40:10] knowledge it wasn't a lack of data
[40:13] it wasn't a lack of information they had
[40:16] all the information at their disposal
[40:18] they had the things that god had told
[40:19] them they had their experience that
[40:21] taught them certain things
[40:22] they had the oral tradition they had the
[40:23] written law they had all the data they
[40:25] had all the information but what
[40:26] destroyed them
[40:28] a lack of understanding a lack of
[40:30] perception a lack of discernment
[40:32] there's times you could say well i know
[40:34] this is a snake
[40:36] and i know what snakes do but the story
[40:40] of the man who picked up the snake that
[40:41] was frozen on the side of the
[40:42] road and put it in his pocket and then
[40:44] the snake warmed up and then it bit the
[40:46] man he's like hey why did you bite me
[40:48] the snake was like
[40:49] you knew i was a snake when you put me
[40:50] in your pocket
[40:52] why should this come as any surprise so
[40:54] you can have all the information you can
[40:55] have all the data you can have all the
[40:57] knowledge
[40:57] but you lack the wisdom and the
[40:58] discernment and the moment say hey once
[41:00] this thing
[41:00] wakes up may not work out very well in
[41:03] your pocket
[41:05] and wisdom is what can teach you that
[41:07] there's a way that we all
[41:08] learn by experience and so that man that
[41:12] day
[41:12] that took that frozen snake and put him
[41:14] in his pocket learned
[41:16] i don't want to do this again and that's
[41:18] how you learn by experience you can have
[41:20] understanding by experience
[41:22] but you know what would be better is if
[41:24] we took the cue from this guy's misdeed
[41:26] and said you know what it's probably
[41:27] wise to not do that
[41:29] and so we can learn from somebody else's
[41:31] mistake we could learn because the guy
[41:32] says hey tell this to generations to
[41:34] come
[41:34] if you know it's a snake don't be
[41:36] surprised if it bites you and then you
[41:37] exercise wisdom and go you know what
[41:39] i've been taught that situations like
[41:40] this don't end well
[41:42] i've been taught not to do this do this
[41:44] and so wisdom
[41:45] is even a better teacher because there's
[41:48] an idea sometimes that well if you have
[41:50] an experience that you don't really know
[41:51] and you can only learn by experience and
[41:53] just because you may be a learner in the
[41:55] classroom by something being tactile or
[41:57] something being visually presented or
[41:59] learning something
[42:00] audibly and there may be different ways
[42:01] that we learn the best way for us to
[42:04] learn is have the wisdom from above
[42:07] because we have that dynamic as being
[42:08] born again from above
[42:10] we have this sense that transcends all
[42:12] other senses
[42:13] and i don't have to put my hand on the
[42:15] of the stove it's
[42:16] ow that burns i'm never going to do that
[42:18] again something can tell me that's hot
[42:21] don't touch it and that's wisdom
[42:25] we can both end up the same way hey i
[42:26] know not to touch that how do you know
[42:30] see these scars and you say thank god i
[42:33] know by wisdom not to do this
[42:36] because people are destroyed for lack of
[42:37] knowledge so it wasn't a lack of
[42:39] knowing the facts or information but
[42:41] they didn't have the analysis to make it
[42:44] beneficial they didn't have the ability
[42:46] to derive value to act on it they lacked
[42:48] the analytics if we want to use that
[42:49] example as we referenced before
[42:51] having a lot of data and a lot of
[42:52] information having the entire message
[42:55] available for us to search
[42:57] hasn't resolved every doctrinal problem
[42:59] has it
[43:00] having all the bible in our language in
[43:03] searchable databases isn't it wonderful
[43:05] that i didn't come to the pulpit today
[43:06] with a bunch of red volumes
[43:07] and you count to know how long the
[43:09] sermon was going to be
[43:11] my goodness he's got 9 10 and 11.
[43:14] you know i mean this guy's gonna be
[43:15] quoting all day long but we can search
[43:17] the bible we can know
[43:19] everything that the bible says about
[43:20] this word we can know everything brother
[43:22] bradham said
[43:23] about splits or or scandal skirts we can
[43:25] look up everything he says about the
[43:27] token everything he says about this and
[43:28] it says about that
[43:29] and at the end of the day if we have all
[43:31] the data and all the information
[43:32] but we don't have the wisdom of god to
[43:35] understand it
[43:36] it's even to our greater detriment to
[43:38] have it all
[43:39] so what do we want to ask god for we
[43:41] want to ask god for revelation not the
[43:42] stack of quotes
[43:44] i've literally had ministers tell me
[43:46] that their quote stack is higher than
[43:48] mine so theirs prevails
[43:53] that literally would say well there's
[43:54] just more more statements in this regard
[43:57] they didn't want to they didn't want to
[43:58] ask god to say lord take this stack
[44:02] and dovetail it with this stack and
[44:04] let's see where we get to one stack
[44:07] just big bank take little bank let's
[44:09] just see if there's a way
[44:11] that god could dovetail these two where
[44:12] there's not two sides
[44:14] there's one truth right and that's what
[44:16] you should ask for is the wisdom of god
[44:18] to navigate a situation like that to
[44:20] look at this stack of quotes and this
[44:21] stack of quotes and these things and
[44:23] those things say lord
[44:24] i need wisdom i need revelation i need
[44:27] understanding
[44:28] to get value out of it to get faith out
[44:30] of it
[44:31] the bible says in proverbs 22 3 a
[44:33] prudent man foreseeth evil prudent means
[44:35] sensible
[44:36] he's sharp he has powers of judgment the
[44:38] prudent man it means he has powers of
[44:39] discernment
[44:40] he has powers of judgment he's astute
[44:42] he's shrewd a prudent man foresees the
[44:45] evil and hides himself
[44:46] this is what a man of wisdom does he
[44:48] prepares himself for any evil
[44:50] and he embraces himself to welcome any
[44:53] good
[44:54] he makes preparation wisdom causes a man
[44:56] to do that spiritual judgment sharp
[44:57] powers of discernment
[44:59] causes him to foresee the evil and hides
[45:00] himself but it says but the simple
[45:02] pass on and are punished
[45:05] this is where revelation produces
[45:07] positive action
[45:09] when you have an understanding about
[45:10] something when you see something's
[45:11] coming when you see something's about to
[45:13] take place
[45:14] if you know it's good if the waters are
[45:15] being stirred you would jump into the
[45:16] pool
[45:18] if you had the sense and this knowledge
[45:20] that this was what god was doing then
[45:21] you would want to avail yourself to this
[45:22] blessing
[45:23] this benefit that god wants to provide i
[45:25] want to by having wisdom and this sharp
[45:27] power of discernment
[45:28] make myself available to receive the
[45:30] blessing from god but then when you see
[45:31] the devil coming with the curse
[45:33] no no don't want to sign for that
[45:35] wouldn't it be wonderful to know
[45:38] when we're getting a box of rattlesnakes
[45:41] i mean the story just seems so easy
[45:44] right
[45:45] if somebody hands you a box of
[45:46] rattlesnakes and you know it's
[45:48] rattlesnakes what would we do
[45:50] uh this is the box of rattlesnakes isn't
[45:52] it yeah it isn't well then i'm not
[45:54] signing for it
[45:56] well why would you do that i know a guy
[45:57] one time who put a snake in his pocket
[45:59] and it bit him
[46:01] so i'm not signing for this box of
[46:02] rattlesnakes but the problem is is
[46:04] rarely is it packaged and it says
[46:06] rattlesnakes inside it says
[46:09] this will simplify your life you will
[46:11] never feel better
[46:13] 30 day back guarantee full warranty
[46:16] you know what's the point what's the
[46:18] risk let's just give it a try
[46:21] there's it's not always declared
[46:24] rattlesnakes
[46:25] what would you want to have discretion
[46:27] sharp powers of discernment to know
[46:29] yeah i don't know about this i'm a
[46:31] little uncertain
[46:32] what did brother branham teach us if
[46:33] there's a question about it
[46:35] leave it alone
[46:39] it says the simple pass on and are
[46:41] punished
[46:43] the simple there we get went into great
[46:44] detail on a wednesday night the simple
[46:46] are the impressionable
[46:48] they're they're they're naive so this is
[46:51] the wrong side of simple we don't say
[46:53] well i want to be simple i want to be
[46:54] simple to where you just believe
[46:56] everything but we we we want to
[46:59] he's talking about this simple or easily
[47:00] influenced really a way of put that when
[47:02] you look at all the different scriptures
[47:03] you could use
[47:04] they're not discerning the simple pass
[47:07] on and they're punished what
[47:08] they're so simple-minded that they can't
[47:10] perceive danger
[47:12] oh that's nothing oh i wouldn't worry
[47:14] about that why does that matter
[47:15] and they just continue on and they are
[47:17] punished
[47:19] and the simple in the bible the word
[47:20] that's used in the hebrew speaks of one
[47:22] who is
[47:22] open-minded they're open-minded
[47:26] well i'm open to that they're enticeable
[47:29] by experience do you want to try this
[47:30] yeah sure i'll try it
[47:33] does that make sense to you i want this
[47:35] part to
[47:36] to really hit home because i want to
[47:37] take i want to pivot here and go a
[47:39] different direction
[47:40] i go further in something the simple
[47:44] cannot discern what's right or wrong
[47:47] they just get lucky when it works out
[47:50] because really they're just enticed by
[47:52] the opportunity they're just enticed by
[47:54] experience
[47:54] they're kind of being enticed by oh this
[47:56] looks great i'm open-minded and they
[47:58] preach you this open-mindedness and
[47:59] being willing to experience and what do
[48:01] you have to lose
[48:02] and i pondered this because i see i see
[48:04] this influence
[48:06] it's an influence i'll admit you know
[48:08] personally that there's a lot of things
[48:10] in the world today
[48:11] and there's intimidation and bullying
[48:13] and threatening and you'll sense it even
[48:14] in the message where if you believe
[48:16] something and you have conviction
[48:17] there's this culture of bullying where
[48:19] people want to bully you out of
[48:20] believing what your conviction and
[48:22] standing by what you believe and even
[48:23] preaching what you believe the truth
[48:25] and what brother branham taught and
[48:26] there's a culture of bullying to cause
[48:28] that person to be silent
[48:30] and there's forces at work in the world
[48:32] where everyone's afraid of becoming the
[48:34] next negative viral phenomenon where i
[48:35] got videoed at this store and this
[48:37] happened and that happened or this
[48:38] sermon goes viral
[48:39] these statements are made and there's a
[48:41] this social justice phenomenon and
[48:43] there's a woke culture if i can maybe
[48:44] use that phrase
[48:45] where you need to be woke and you need
[48:47] to be re realizing this is bad and
[48:49] that's wrong
[48:50] and we need to do this when you do that
[48:51] but this whole idea of a walk culture
[48:54] there's they push an idea that of
[48:56] open-mindedness
[48:57] that sometimes is even more toxic than
[48:59] the bias they're trying to identify
[49:03] they're saying well i'm woke and i'm
[49:04] open-minded and they realize
[49:06] they're actually perpetuating the very
[49:08] things that they claim to be standing
[49:09] against
[49:10] because what being woke isn't the
[49:12] solution in this day and age
[49:13] if there's prejudice if there's bias is
[49:15] there injustice injustice if there's
[49:17] inequality
[49:18] you're not going to accomplish it by
[49:19] quote-unquote being woke
[49:22] or becoming a social justice warrior or
[49:24] using the right kind of avatar on social
[49:26] media
[49:27] none of that's really ultimately going
[49:28] to make a difference what's going to
[49:29] make a difference
[49:30] is wisdom from above a genuine
[49:33] holy spirit-led sensitivity and
[49:36] understanding
[49:37] about the situation about the
[49:40] circumstance
[49:42] and so this oh the simple it describes
[49:45] the world we're living in now
[49:46] there's just no real conviction there's
[49:47] no real a solid feeling everything's
[49:50] just so loose and
[49:51] uh free-for-all and without borders and
[49:53] without positions
[49:54] and so we want to be caution ourselves
[49:56] against this pressure
[49:58] to be more open-minded because the real
[50:01] solution to a closed mind
[50:03] is the mind of god it's the wisdom of
[50:06] god that gives us the knowledge the
[50:07] understanding the discernment that we
[50:10] need
[50:15] i'm going to go through a few scriptures
[50:16] very quickly proverbs said simple
[50:18] understand wisdom fools
[50:20] be of an understanding heart be open to
[50:22] truth be open to correctness
[50:24] don't be susceptible to negative
[50:25] influences don't just be open to
[50:26] everything
[50:27] because wisdom is the principal thing
[50:29] therefore get wisdom and with all thy
[50:30] getting get understanding
[50:33] what wisdom wisdom from above divine
[50:36] wisdom
[50:37] not a wisdom that is just a natural i
[50:40] know how to change my oil in my car i
[50:42] know how to do this or i know how to do
[50:43] that
[50:44] i it's not a wisdom that knows how to
[50:46] resolve
[50:47] uh tricks and puzzles and i'm really
[50:49] good at puzzles and this is the wisdom
[50:51] this is the theory
[50:52] i've developed my own theory on how to
[50:55] solve a puzzle
[50:56] i have a way of doing it if you do a
[50:58] puzzle with me and you have a different
[50:59] way of doing it you'll find that i have
[51:00] a very particular way of
[51:01] solving a puzzle and you got to do this
[51:03] first and then you got to do this next
[51:05] and then you do this you do that and
[51:06] you're sitting around going when are we
[51:07] ever going to start putting this thing
[51:08] together
[51:09] no you got to do the first five steps
[51:10] first if you don't do the first five
[51:12] steps you're just asking for trouble
[51:13] later on it's kind of like
[51:14] is it the idea behind a puzzle just to
[51:16] be together and have fun well
[51:17] yeah but this is the fun way to do it
[51:21] we're not talking about that kind of way
[51:23] where you just have a little wise in
[51:24] certain things you have a little bit of
[51:26] knowledge and certain things
[51:26] but we're actually talking about if
[51:27] there is any human knowledge it's
[51:30] subject to the power of spiritual
[51:31] discernment
[51:32] if any gift any ability any way that you
[51:35] can do something it's
[51:36] human knowledge and human skill that's
[51:38] subject to spiritual discernment
[51:40] just because you're able to go build a
[51:42] house and do it cheaply and do it really
[51:43] well doesn't mean you should always
[51:44] build houses for people
[51:47] right just because you're really good at
[51:48] changing your own oil you may not want
[51:50] to go
[51:51] and open an oil change company listen
[51:54] just because you
[51:54] can smoke really good meats brother
[51:57] chris wherever you are just because
[51:58] you're really good on the grill and the
[51:59] flat top and you've got a nice
[52:01] pellet smoker doesn't mean you run out
[52:03] and start a restaurant
[52:06] you want to know how to make a small
[52:07] fortune start with a large fortune and
[52:10] open a restaurant
[52:15] so wisdom tells you hey just because i
[52:16] can do it doesn't mean i should
[52:19] when does that happen when you have
[52:20] spiritual discernment well i did this
[52:22] and it worked out great and i did that
[52:23] and i did that
[52:24] it may work for the world but you you're
[52:27] under different rules you're under
[52:28] different requirements you have a
[52:29] different goal your goal isn't just to
[52:31] retire sitting fat and having your 401k
[52:34] full and being able to live so many
[52:35] years that's not your goal your goal is
[52:37] to get out of here
[52:38] and the more we're consumed with whether
[52:40] or not we can retire
[52:42] the less chance we have of getting out
[52:44] of here before i retire
[52:47] so we need wisdom that is from above
[52:49] it's the principal thing
[52:51] i want to be very quick in this very
[52:54] quickly refer again to
[52:55] solomon
[52:58] solomon realized i'm a child i don't
[53:00] know how to go out or to come in
[53:02] i'm i'm just a child
[53:06] and so god said ask whatever you want
[53:10] and solomon knew enough to say i'm a kid
[53:13] trying to run a family
[53:15] i'm a kid trying to run a government i'm
[53:17] a kid trying to keep a people together
[53:19] they're the greatest people on earth
[53:20] so he said i want an understanding heart
[53:23] to judge thy people
[53:24] that i may discern between good and bad
[53:27] that's what i want an understanding of
[53:28] heart to judge the people that i may
[53:30] discern
[53:31] between good and bad and god said that
[53:33] solomon asked for understanding
[53:35] to discern judgment understanding to
[53:38] know what to do
[53:40] understanding to know what was right in
[53:42] a particular situation understanding to
[53:44] know what was best in a particular
[53:46] situation and the bible says that god
[53:48] gave him a wise and understanding heart
[53:50] to faithfully
[53:51] govern the people he had a wise and
[53:53] understanding heart where he had the
[53:54] powers of discernment he had the power
[53:56] of wisdom
[53:57] he had the ability to look at a
[53:58] situation and know the right thing to do
[54:00] in order to govern a great people when
[54:03] the bible says if you lack wisdom
[54:05] then number one we have to recognize we
[54:07] lack wisdom and in itself that may be
[54:08] enough wisdom to start with
[54:10] to be able to perceive hey i don't have
[54:12] the goods i don't have what it takes i
[54:13] don't have the knowledge the skill or
[54:14] understanding
[54:15] to really live my life well to be able
[54:17] to be a good husband to be a good
[54:19] christian whatever your scenario may be
[54:20] that's the first place to start is to
[54:22] recognize in revelations 3 18
[54:25] that i need in 3 19 that i need
[54:27] something from god
[54:29] i need something from god to open my
[54:31] eyes i know that i lack i need to have
[54:33] an understanding
[54:34] and to call upon god for revelation more
[54:36] than anything and start from the
[54:37] standpoint that i have enough wisdom
[54:39] knowledge and understanding discernment
[54:40] to know that i lack
[54:41] so in my lacking i'm going to ask god
[54:43] for wisdom and you can do exactly what
[54:45] solomon did just on a smaller scale
[54:48] whatever you're running if you're just
[54:49] running your own little bedroom in your
[54:51] car and your own little business or
[54:52] whatever world you're living in
[54:54] you can ask god for wisdom and receive
[54:56] it in the same measure that it was
[54:57] effective for solomon
[54:58] you could receive it for your own life
[55:02] and when we read in verses 16 to 27 in
[55:05] first kings three
[55:07] immediately after god says he gave him
[55:08] understanding to discern
[55:10] judgment give them the understanding of
[55:12] a man that could judge the people to
[55:13] discern between good and bad
[55:15] the very first story that brings out the
[55:18] wisdom of solomon and begins to make a
[55:19] name for him
[55:20] is two harlots come and stand before him
[55:22] both of them claiming one baby
[55:24] one says her baby died in the night no
[55:26] one says no her baby died in the night
[55:27] the one says this is my baby that says
[55:28] no it's my baby
[55:30] and solomon used the wisdom that was
[55:32] from above
[55:34] and he said bring me a sword
[55:37] and immediately thinking a sword
[55:41] and that was his response his response
[55:43] to bring me
[55:44] a sword it was his wisdom in judgment
[55:48] it was he wasn't a child anymore
[55:51] he had the ability even in that moment
[55:53] to say well i don't know who's telling
[55:54] the truth and who's not
[55:55] because sometimes that's what we think
[55:57] discernment is is reading people's minds
[56:00] how many times are we warned over and
[56:01] over and over again in the message i'm
[56:03] not reading your mind
[56:05] so discernment isn't trying to figure
[56:07] out hmm what is he thinking
[56:10] but wisdom is being able to deal with
[56:12] the situation where you know there is
[56:13] deception and i'm not quite sure if he's
[56:15] telling me the truth or not
[56:18] i mean there's riddles that you're
[56:19] confronted with well if you ask the
[56:21] question you know this one's going to
[56:22] lie
[56:22] and then this one you know is going to
[56:23] tell you the truth but you can only ask
[56:25] the one
[56:26] then how do you get your way out of it
[56:29] you ask the one what would this other
[56:30] guy say
[56:32] right and if he tells the truth then you
[56:35] know whatever this guy's going to say is
[56:36] going to be the lie so you just do the
[56:37] opposite
[56:39] yeah see wisdom i just came up with that
[56:42] no it's a riddle it's a well-known
[56:43] riddle
[56:44] how you get out of a situation like you
[56:45] have to use wisdom because you don't
[56:46] necessarily know so you got to come up
[56:48] with the way to find the rat in the wood
[56:49] pile so to speak
[56:51] you got to come up with a way to figure
[56:52] out what's the right way there's
[56:53] deception there's
[56:54] false pretense and there's all sorts of
[56:56] mirages and things on the horizon
[56:58] i don't know how to read this i don't
[56:59] know how to read the signs i know what
[57:00] to do give me wisdom and
[57:01] solomon had the kind of wisdom to
[57:04] provoke
[57:04] something and he's not just reading
[57:07] minds
[57:09] he was given the ability to use wisdom
[57:11] in a particular situation to find out
[57:12] right or wrong
[57:13] i want to call it practical discernment
[57:17] we're not going to be able to read one
[57:18] another's minds but we can have a
[57:20] discernment that is practical every day
[57:23] a practical discernment
[57:36] i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap it up short
[57:38] this morning
[57:40] so just trying to find
[57:44] where i want to
[57:47] take this from
[57:51] solomon said bring me a sword what did
[57:54] he say
[57:55] i want to take this child and divide it
[57:56] in half and you both will have half
[58:00] and it provoked the love of a mother to
[58:02] say no preserve the child
[58:04] and the one who was lying was
[58:06] indifferent
[58:08] and that's just a scenario when solomon
[58:11] made a decision he asked a question that
[58:13] brought out the real truth and the real
[58:14] intent
[58:15] we can ask god for that kind of
[58:17] practical discernment
[58:19] we can ask god for that kind of wisdom
[58:21] where he's not a child anymore
[58:23] and we could take the faith that we have
[58:26] and nourish it by the revelation of the
[58:28] word
[58:28] and in nourishing a revelation of the
[58:30] word we can increase our wisdom and our
[58:31] discernment
[58:32] this is why we're taught we need to call
[58:34] upon god for revelation more than
[58:35] anything we need to ask god for wisdom
[58:37] to discern what is right
[58:40] in philippians chapter 1 verses 9 and 10
[58:42] it says in this i pray
[58:44] that your love may abound yet more and
[58:46] more in knowledge
[58:47] and in all judgment
[58:50] to have a greater depth of knowledge and
[58:52] a more comprehensive discernment
[58:54] this is what he's saying he wants them
[58:55] to do are they saved yes or they feel
[58:57] the holy ghost yes so i pray that your
[58:59] love would abound
[59:00] more and more and as your love abounds
[59:02] you have more knowledge and more
[59:03] comprehensive discernment why
[59:04] that you may approve that word is
[59:06] discern that you may discern
[59:08] things that are excellent and that you
[59:10] be sincere and without offense
[59:12] since it means you're judged right
[59:13] you're judged correctly
[59:16] when you're examined when you're when
[59:18] you're looked at when you're proven
[59:20] you can be found that you made the right
[59:22] decision you've done what was right
[59:24] so our discernment grows as our love for
[59:26] the word grows our discernment grows as
[59:27] our faith
[59:28] grows as our understanding grows this is
[59:30] something as we get into the word of god
[59:32] as we pray and read our bibles as we
[59:33] listen to the word of god
[59:35] as we feed on the things that are taught
[59:37] and the things that are preached then
[59:38] our
[59:38] love for truth is increasing it's being
[59:40] nourished our faith is growing and with
[59:42] the faith that is growing
[59:44] we receive a greater ability to discern
[59:47] that your faith may abound yet more and
[59:49] more
[59:52] jesus said and ye shall know the truth
[59:55] john chapter 8 32 and ye shall know the
[59:58] truth and the truth
[1:00:00] shall make you free that no doesn't mean
[1:00:03] head knowledge you shall perceive the
[1:00:05] truth
[1:00:07] you shall understand the truth and
[1:00:09] that's when truth makes you free
[1:00:11] when you know truth up here there's no
[1:00:13] liberty
[1:00:14] but when you perceive it when it's
[1:00:15] trying to be hid when you recognize it
[1:00:17] when it was
[1:00:17] covered up by some lie when you're
[1:00:19] trying to be steered away from it and
[1:00:20] you perceive it you understand you catch
[1:00:22] it
[1:00:22] whenever you have a revelation of the
[1:00:24] word it's revelation that makes you free
[1:00:30] i want to i'm going to want to come to a
[1:00:32] a
[1:00:34] a stopping point and so
[1:00:44] to discern means to perceive
[1:00:48] to have a discernment it's a keenness of
[1:00:51] judgment to make the right decision
[1:00:52] about something
[1:00:54] to have discernment is to to recognize
[1:00:56] differences
[1:00:59] if you discern you can recognize or
[1:01:01] detect you can distinguish or perceive
[1:01:03] when two things are different
[1:01:05] you ever had one of those pictures that
[1:01:06] say find 10 things wrong in this picture
[1:01:09] or he said compare this picture to the
[1:01:11] other picture says what's different
[1:01:12] about this picture another picture
[1:01:14] well if you're using your five-year-old
[1:01:15] us usborne book we can figure that out
[1:01:17] as adults pretty quickly
[1:01:19] well you couldn't get that you know how
[1:01:20] old are you oh five i mean you really
[1:01:22] couldn't get that
[1:01:23] because it's easy to us but there's
[1:01:25] there's riddles that are more
[1:01:26] appropriate for the adults it says spot
[1:01:28] five differences between these two
[1:01:29] pictures what are you gonna use a keen
[1:01:31] eye
[1:01:32] to identify things that are very very
[1:01:34] subtle well that's the same way that
[1:01:35] spiritual discernment is
[1:01:36] its ability to distinguish differences
[1:01:39] once something is presenting itself one
[1:01:41] way but you can
[1:01:41] discern that it's not actually the way
[1:01:43] that it's presented
[1:01:45] the ability to recognize well this is
[1:01:46] not that and this is different than that
[1:01:48] that's what discernment means this is
[1:01:50] such
[1:01:50] a wonderful gift to have and if i could
[1:01:53] put it in these terms the gift of
[1:01:55] discernment was very pronounced and on
[1:01:57] display in brother brown's ministry
[1:01:58] could you say amen to that
[1:02:00] it was it was a sign that got our
[1:02:02] attention it was a sign that the son of
[1:02:04] man was going to be revealed it wasn't
[1:02:06] the revealing of the son of man but it
[1:02:08] was god identified himself
[1:02:09] in flesh showing that the time of the
[1:02:11] revealing of the son of man was coming
[1:02:13] and was at hand and he exhibited this
[1:02:15] sign throughout his ministry we see it
[1:02:17] in the 50s and early 60s
[1:02:19] and it was pointing to that time when
[1:02:21] the son of man would be revealed to the
[1:02:23] open of those seals
[1:02:24] and it was such a pronounced gift of
[1:02:26] discernment that that
[1:02:28] in itself should be some signification
[1:02:31] to us
[1:02:32] that if the sign that preceded the
[1:02:34] reveal of the son of man
[1:02:35] was discernment then the impact of the
[1:02:38] reveal of the son of man
[1:02:39] should be the bride's discernment if
[1:02:42] discernment got my attention then
[1:02:44] discernment is going to be my going to
[1:02:46] be part of my experience and brother ben
[1:02:48] could stand before an audience and give
[1:02:50] someone's name and their address and
[1:02:51] what was wrong with them he could even
[1:02:53] give nicknames and he could give this
[1:02:54] and he could give that
[1:02:55] and he wasn't reading their mind and
[1:02:58] what would he say
[1:02:59] who told me that how would i know that
[1:03:01] i'm not reading your mind i'm not
[1:03:02] reading the prayer card
[1:03:03] that was wisdom from above it was
[1:03:05] discernment that god was giving him
[1:03:07] and if god could give brother branham
[1:03:09] discernment from above to know someone's
[1:03:11] name to know someone's sinful condition
[1:03:13] to know someone's past and know their
[1:03:15] near future then god
[1:03:16] today can give you discernment for
[1:03:19] whatever situation you're facing
[1:03:21] it just doesn't need to be a public show
[1:03:23] doesn't need to be on a platform you
[1:03:24] don't need the vindication god needs the
[1:03:26] glory
[1:03:27] you need the benefit practical
[1:03:30] discernment
[1:03:32] so discernment means to recognize or
[1:03:33] perceive
[1:03:35] differences and i was i was wanting to
[1:03:38] take some time to go through how that
[1:03:42] discernment to discern between good and
[1:03:46] evil is what solomon asked for an
[1:03:47] understanding heart to discern between
[1:03:48] good and bad
[1:03:50] that's the mark of a mature believer to
[1:03:52] have that kind of discernment
[1:03:53] not talking about reading minds will
[1:03:55] talk about wisdom from above
[1:03:57] and it's a way that our experience grows
[1:04:00] and our understanding grows to give us a
[1:04:02] more comprehensive discernment
[1:04:05] brother and says we need discernment we
[1:04:08] need the discerning by the word
[1:04:10] the words right take the word god's
[1:04:12] word's always right
[1:04:14] we can't discern by what people think
[1:04:16] what intellectuals tell us
[1:04:17] what psychiatrists tell us we gotta go
[1:04:20] by what god says
[1:04:23] we need it we don't need another man
[1:04:26] behind a pulpit calling a prayer line
[1:04:28] calling out people's names and
[1:04:29] sins and and a minister standing up
[1:04:32] before the people and discerning things
[1:04:33] that go on
[1:04:34] those gifts are still in the church and
[1:04:36] god still uses them i've witnessed them
[1:04:39] but they're not used publicly to draw
[1:04:40] people's attention to that person
[1:04:42] because we received a message
[1:04:44] we've received if we want to call it our
[1:04:46] eighth messenger it was christ
[1:04:48] we're not looking for another one not
[1:04:49] looking for another prophet we're not
[1:04:50] looking for another explanation
[1:04:52] but there's still a gift of discernment
[1:04:54] that can work in your life
[1:04:56] god says that we need it but the brain
[1:04:58] says we need discernment we need the
[1:04:59] discerning by the word
[1:05:00] not what we think not what intellectuals
[1:05:02] tell us what psychiatrist tells
[1:05:04] we got to go by what god says
[1:05:07] so what's the answer to laodicea behold
[1:05:09] i stand at the door and knock
[1:05:12] that's what it comes down to that's what
[1:05:13] the conclusion behold i stand at the
[1:05:14] door knock
[1:05:15] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:05:17] door i will come into him
[1:05:18] and will sup with him and he with me he
[1:05:21] is our only hope
[1:05:23] discernment by the revelation of the son
[1:05:25] of man oh it's sodom it's gamora what's
[1:05:27] the answer
[1:05:27] have christ be revealed to you have
[1:05:29] christ continually be revealed to you
[1:05:32] the revelation of the son of man is our
[1:05:34] weapon to overcome the laodicean age
[1:05:36] christ
[1:05:37] is our only hope what is christ the word
[1:05:39] who judgeth all things
[1:05:41] by which all things are going to be
[1:05:43] judged i want the mind of christ to know
[1:05:45] i want the spirit and nature of christ
[1:05:47] to understand i want
[1:05:49] sensitivity and understanding of the
[1:05:51] spirit to know the decisions to say the
[1:05:53] right things to do
[1:05:54] and i want to i want to have that i want
[1:05:57] to ask god for it
[1:06:04] the bible says above all in ephesians
[1:06:06] chapter 6 verses 16 to 17
[1:06:09] above all taking the shield of faith
[1:06:10] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:06:12] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:06:16] so faith defends faith protects whatever
[1:06:20] whatever satan's trying to do whatever
[1:06:22] trick whatever game he's playing
[1:06:25] faith can protect you from it it says to
[1:06:28] take the helmet of salvation
[1:06:30] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:06:32] word
[1:06:33] of god so you're to take the sword of
[1:06:36] the spirit the word of god is what
[1:06:38] sharper than any two-edged sword it's
[1:06:40] quick and powerful what does it do it
[1:06:42] discerns
[1:06:44] so the spirit of god the word of god is
[1:06:46] a discerner
[1:06:48] and we're asked to take the word as our
[1:06:50] sword
[1:06:51] why would we not think that it can
[1:06:52] discern
[1:06:54] why would we not think that faith is
[1:06:56] just merely believing in something
[1:06:59] and not empowering you by discernment to
[1:07:02] make decisions to do things to to say
[1:07:05] the right thing
[1:07:06] to think the right thing
[1:07:09] the sword of the word sword of the
[1:07:12] spirit which is the word of god it's our
[1:07:13] only offensive weapon when you read the
[1:07:15] ephesians 6.
[1:07:16] everything else you put on is to protect
[1:07:18] you helmet of salvation the breastplate
[1:07:20] the feet are shod all these different
[1:07:22] things he's only given you one weapon
[1:07:23] there's only one thing then your
[1:07:25] arsenal that's a weapon it's the word of
[1:07:27] god
[1:07:28] the word which is sharper and more
[1:07:31] powerful than any two-edged sword
[1:07:32] a word which is a discerner so your
[1:07:35] faith will protect you
[1:07:38] and faith then which takes a hold of
[1:07:40] this sword of the word of god
[1:07:44] is what you can use as an offensive
[1:07:45] weapon to make decisions
[1:07:48] to make your way into progress that's
[1:07:51] why we could say just like solomon give
[1:07:52] me a sword
[1:07:54] give me the sword that's where we're
[1:07:56] ending ending wednesday night we've
[1:07:58] amplified it a lot more this morning but
[1:07:59] we're going to end it
[1:08:01] with this thought of taking this weapon
[1:08:04] by the word of god and
[1:08:05] exercising it brevard says quickening
[1:08:08] power gives discernment and it is the
[1:08:10] rising of the sun
[1:08:11] quickening power gives discernment to
[1:08:13] know what's wrong with you and what to
[1:08:14] do
[1:08:15] what you have done and what you ought
[1:08:16] not to have done what you should have
[1:08:18] done
[1:08:18] and what you will be quickening power
[1:08:21] now we can say that this is applicable
[1:08:23] to how god would use the ministry of a
[1:08:24] prophet to stand before someone
[1:08:26] and quickening power could give them not
[1:08:28] give him knowledge to know what's wrong
[1:08:30] with the person and what they should do
[1:08:31] to tell them what they should have done
[1:08:33] what they should not have done
[1:08:34] and what they should be doing and what
[1:08:36] they will be quickening power could work
[1:08:39] that way on brother branham for someone
[1:08:41] else's benefit
[1:08:42] but quickening power gives you
[1:08:44] discernment
[1:08:46] and quickening power won't say a but to
[1:08:47] it that it would be competing
[1:08:49] and quickening power can give you
[1:08:51] discernment to know what's wrong with
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:53] it can give you discernment to know what
[1:08:54] you should have done it can give you
[1:08:56] discernment to know what you should do
[1:08:59] what does that quickening power quicken
[1:09:01] power that you have received it can
[1:09:02] empower you
[1:09:03] and give you discernment to do the right
[1:09:06] thing
[1:09:08] i know that i'm hammering it over and
[1:09:09] over again for now for an hour and
[1:09:12] ten minutes just been saying the same
[1:09:13] thing over and over again but i want you
[1:09:15] to get it
[1:09:16] you can ask god for wisdom for daily
[1:09:18] tasks
[1:09:19] you can ask god for wisdom for daily
[1:09:21] decisions you can ask god to give me
[1:09:23] wisdom to raise my kids and to make sure
[1:09:25] i'm raising them in the fear of the lord
[1:09:26] and the
[1:09:27] admonition of god and then i'm trying to
[1:09:29] raise them up in the way that they
[1:09:30] should go and i'm doing it with a heart
[1:09:32] full of love and not just a fistful of
[1:09:34] of spankings and lord give me wisdom
[1:09:36] give me wisdom but at some point
[1:09:38] you're going to be in a situation where
[1:09:39] you need to know what to do at that
[1:09:41] moment
[1:09:43] and the wisdom is not just out there in
[1:09:44] the ether somewhere but god too in that
[1:09:46] very moment can quicken your heart to
[1:09:48] say
[1:09:48] this is what i need to do this is what i
[1:09:50] need to do this is how i need to handle
[1:09:52] this situation
[1:09:54] sometimes you're just too quick to react
[1:09:57] knee-jerk
[1:09:59] just hit just yell to correct
[1:10:02] hitting and yelling
[1:10:07] did i step on everyone's toe i mean
[1:10:09] where's the single guy without any kids
[1:10:11] when you need him right yeah amen to
[1:10:12] that
[1:10:14] and that's what we do you know we
[1:10:15] correct yelling by yelling we correct
[1:10:17] hitting by spontaneously hitting
[1:10:20] and it literally is you see your son go
[1:10:23] you're standing behind your son she go
[1:10:25] and the site just repeats itself because
[1:10:28] he's like well
[1:10:28] i thought i had every right to hit him
[1:10:30] in the head and your son's thinking
[1:10:32] and my dad thought he had every right to
[1:10:33] hit me in the head so there's some logic
[1:10:35] to what i did
[1:10:36] he just didn't like it
[1:10:40] there's wisdom from above that can help
[1:10:41] us navigate those things
[1:10:43] i wasn't intending to get so literal and
[1:10:45] so practical
[1:10:47] but there is a wisdom that we can have
[1:10:49] in a moment in an instance and that's
[1:10:51] what we're asking god for
[1:10:52] quick and empowered to discern
[1:10:55] i wanted to share this wednesday night
[1:10:58] and some of you might maybe you'll ask
[1:10:59] me later on if you wanted us to rehear
[1:11:00] wednesday why don't you just play the
[1:11:02] tape
[1:11:02] well i'm not about playing my tapes
[1:11:04] how's that
[1:11:06] but we're making decisions i made a
[1:11:08] statement i think at the end of service
[1:11:09] we're making decisions in a world that
[1:11:10] was built by deception and driven by
[1:11:12] lust that's what we're living in right
[1:11:14] now
[1:11:15] we're living in a world that deceives us
[1:11:17] it's a world
[1:11:18] we're making decisions every day in a
[1:11:20] deceiving world
[1:11:22] and a world that says do this you'll
[1:11:24] like it
[1:11:25] and a world that says one plus one
[1:11:27] equals five
[1:11:30] and we need the kind of wisdom and
[1:11:31] discernment to know
[1:11:33] no that's not the case not that we'd be
[1:11:37] good at math
[1:11:38] i used this example one time so i don't
[1:11:40] think it'll ever work again i think i
[1:11:41] used it twice and the word is out
[1:11:43] but how many legs does a horse have four
[1:11:47] but if i told you the tail was actually
[1:11:49] a leg how many would would it have
[1:11:54] no no it wouldn't be five a horse has
[1:11:57] four legs
[1:11:58] no matter what i tell you about the tail
[1:12:02] if i say the tail is a fifth leg a horse
[1:12:04] still only has four legs
[1:12:06] and that's the kind of wisdom we need
[1:12:08] that's the kind of discernment we need
[1:12:09] to realize wait a minute this is a trick
[1:12:10] this is a trap no
[1:12:11] it doesn't matter what you you change
[1:12:13] the rules we're no longer operating by
[1:12:14] the same rules
[1:12:15] people will blow us over a bunch of
[1:12:16] stuff bunch of stuff but it's all these
[1:12:17] assumptions and they go and that's why
[1:12:19] it's this
[1:12:20] and if we're real quick just to assume
[1:12:21] that everything they said was true
[1:12:23] it'd be really easy to buy the lie but
[1:12:26] you have wisdom to step back and say
[1:12:27] wait a minute you made a few this is all
[1:12:28] based on upon a lot of assumptions
[1:12:30] well how do you know this is true how do
[1:12:32] you know that is true
[1:12:34] there's a lot of times we've believed a
[1:12:35] lie because we assumed the backstory
[1:12:39] and we need wisdom to begin to challenge
[1:12:41] assumptions be wisdom to begin to
[1:12:43] challenge certain things
[1:12:44] to know that this is not what i need for
[1:12:46] myself
[1:12:48] for my family so we need an instinct
[1:12:52] i'm calling that instinct wisdom from
[1:12:54] above i'm wanting to very
[1:12:56] particularly refer it to discernment
[1:13:00] a discernment that can withstand
[1:13:01] pressure discernment that can overcome
[1:13:03] obstacles
[1:13:07] we've heard stories of brother banham
[1:13:09] talking about how when he was in india
[1:13:11] and he noticed animals that had all been
[1:13:12] along alongside a wall
[1:13:15] move away from the wall and birds begin
[1:13:18] to fly
[1:13:19] and it's kind of what's going on what's
[1:13:20] happening and this phenomena take place
[1:13:23] i mentioned it because brother brown
[1:13:24] makes reference to it in the message and
[1:13:26] it got me pondering this
[1:13:27] some years ago and brother brown says
[1:13:30] sure enough there's an earthquake
[1:13:32] that came and that wall fell and we
[1:13:34] attribute some kind of knowledge
[1:13:36] in witnessing that that is there
[1:13:38] something that the animals know did god
[1:13:39] tell them hey there's an earthquake
[1:13:40] coming what is it that
[1:13:41] they went what were the dynamics at work
[1:13:44] so this was um a program a public
[1:13:47] broadcasting station
[1:13:49] a study that they put out a transcript
[1:13:51] or something that i'd read but it was
[1:13:52] published by pbs plenty of studies have
[1:13:55] shown that some
[1:13:56] animals can sense major changes in
[1:13:58] weather
[1:13:59] worms for instance are known to flea
[1:14:01] rising groundwater
[1:14:02] birds are known to be sensitive to air
[1:14:04] pressure changes
[1:14:05] and often hunkered down before a big
[1:14:07] storm so
[1:14:08] sensing major changes sensitive to
[1:14:11] pressure changes
[1:14:12] in florida researchers studying tagged
[1:14:14] sharks
[1:14:16] say they flee to deeper waters just
[1:14:18] before a big hurricane arrives
[1:14:20] they also may be sensing the air and
[1:14:22] water pressure changes
[1:14:24] so there's a they can sense major change
[1:14:27] sensitive to air
[1:14:28] changes sensing air and water pressure
[1:14:29] changes
[1:14:31] caused by the big storm it says science
[1:14:33] scientists are skeptical
[1:14:35] that any special sixth sense helped
[1:14:39] so the science is skeptical about the
[1:14:41] fact that they have a sixth sense
[1:14:43] then the united states geological
[1:14:44] society published this report we can
[1:14:46] easily explain the cause of unusual
[1:14:48] animal behavior
[1:14:49] seconds before humans feel an earthquake
[1:14:51] we're trying to figure this out right
[1:14:53] how do animals do this very few humans
[1:14:56] notice the smaller p wave that travels
[1:14:58] the fastest from the earthquake source
[1:15:00] and arrives before the larger s wave but
[1:15:02] many animals with more
[1:15:04] keen senses are able to fill the p wave
[1:15:07] seconds before the s wave arrives
[1:15:10] so animals have a different intuition
[1:15:12] and sense
[1:15:13] they can sense something before humans
[1:15:15] senses what they're saying
[1:15:17] if in fact there are precursors to a
[1:15:20] significant earthquake that we have yet
[1:15:21] to learn about
[1:15:22] such as ground tilting groundwater
[1:15:24] changes electrical or magnetic field
[1:15:26] variations
[1:15:27] indeed it's possible that some animals
[1:15:30] could sense these signals
[1:15:31] and connect their perception with an
[1:15:33] impending earthquake
[1:15:36] could you just ponder this for a little
[1:15:37] bit science is skeptical about whether
[1:15:40] or not
[1:15:40] there's some sixth sense that animals
[1:15:42] have
[1:15:44] but they realize they can obviously see
[1:15:46] that animals have
[1:15:47] some perception greater than our own and
[1:15:50] respond to a catastrophe
[1:15:52] or a major earthquake or major storm
[1:15:54] well before humans do
[1:15:56] a tagged shark will go to deeper waters
[1:15:58] before a hurricane
[1:16:00] birds will sense air pressure changes
[1:16:02] they have a discernment they have a
[1:16:03] perception of changing circumstance
[1:16:05] situations
[1:16:06] and they're able to flee and science is
[1:16:08] like well you know we think it's because
[1:16:09] of this we think it's because of that
[1:16:11] but maybe there's something else we
[1:16:12] don't know about these animals
[1:16:15] there's other ways that these major
[1:16:17] things take place and transpire
[1:16:19] that they can sense it before we sense
[1:16:21] it they can measure it before we measure
[1:16:23] it
[1:16:23] and maybe that's what gives them the
[1:16:25] ability to do it and they're saying
[1:16:26] in other words they're not going to say
[1:16:28] it's supernatural
[1:16:31] it's innate within them now that's fair
[1:16:34] enough for me
[1:16:36] if they want to disavow that it's
[1:16:37] supernatural because these are natural
[1:16:39] birds and natural sharks and natural
[1:16:41] uh animals but who gave that nature to
[1:16:45] them
[1:16:47] god gave animal life an instinct
[1:16:50] mother nature if you want to call it
[1:16:51] that is a divine attribute built within
[1:16:54] the creation
[1:16:55] to know the sap and the tree what does
[1:16:57] it do it guns down
[1:16:58] runs down into the ground into the root
[1:17:00] system to preserve it and protect life
[1:17:02] during a certain time of year this is a
[1:17:03] cycle it's in life it's a nature
[1:17:05] built within the creation itself to what
[1:17:07] preserve itself
[1:17:09] it's a wisdom of creation a wisdom of
[1:17:11] nature and scientists saying hey
[1:17:13] animals have this perception this
[1:17:14] ability to discern certain things before
[1:17:17] something happens
[1:17:18] and they can preserve themselves and
[1:17:20] brother brahm says surely if god gives a
[1:17:22] fish
[1:17:22] and a bird discernment how much more
[1:17:25] should he give his children
[1:17:27] praise the lord for that if god could
[1:17:29] give a bird discernment
[1:17:30] if god could give a fish to servant he's
[1:17:32] saying how much more can god give his
[1:17:35] children discernment
[1:17:37] to get away from this to flee to that to
[1:17:39] make these kinds of decisions
[1:17:41] god given anal life discernment to
[1:17:43] protect them and preserve them
[1:17:44] can give you the same
[1:17:47] god can give his children discernment
[1:17:51] the musicians would come or maybe we're
[1:17:52] just with brother micah today i'm
[1:17:53] certainly fine with that brother mike if
[1:17:55] you could come
[1:17:57] discernment empowers us to daily
[1:17:59] overcome
[1:18:00] to do it on a daily basis all the
[1:18:02] challenges we face on every level
[1:18:05] the bible says that wisdom is justified
[1:18:07] over children
[1:18:09] our faith our wisdom is going to be
[1:18:11] expressed through the decisions we make
[1:18:14] our faith is an even expression of our
[1:18:15] godly wisdom and knowledge and righteous
[1:18:17] decision-making
[1:18:19] and i believe that this is what we ought
[1:18:22] to believe for ourselves
[1:18:25] that my faith will produce a knowledge
[1:18:27] that can pierce a veil
[1:18:30] my faith can bring a knowledge that can
[1:18:31] uncover schemes and
[1:18:33] find what is right i want to encourage
[1:18:37] you to pray for
[1:18:38] discernment that if you ask god for
[1:18:41] revelation
[1:18:42] then it's a revelation that gives wisdom
[1:18:44] and understanding
[1:18:45] wisdom is the principle thing and with
[1:18:47] all thy getting get understanding
[1:18:50] pray for spiritual sensitivity
[1:18:53] discernment is not always this sword
[1:18:54] that's going to hurt that's going to cut
[1:18:56] and divide and it's
[1:18:57] righteous indignation against all things
[1:18:59] evil but a spiritual sensitivity to
[1:19:01] understand why things are the way they
[1:19:02] are
[1:19:04] a spiritual sensitivity to understand
[1:19:06] where a person is coming from
[1:19:07] you may vehemently disagree with their
[1:19:09] conviction you may despise the decision
[1:19:12] they make but if you lack
[1:19:13] empathy if you do lack even lack even
[1:19:15] sympathy if you lack sensitivity to what
[1:19:17] the person is going through
[1:19:18] if you lack understanding of what got
[1:19:20] them in that place to begin with you'll
[1:19:22] never be able to help him out of it
[1:19:24] you'll never be able to present the
[1:19:26] truth in love
[1:19:32] discernment is what makes the power of
[1:19:35] satan's
[1:19:37] he just his power of sensibility and
[1:19:39] what what he says is right his ability
[1:19:41] to deceive discernment is what destroys
[1:19:43] that
[1:19:45] discernment is what defeats it
[1:19:48] and i've been pondering this
[1:19:51] thought now for many many hours
[1:19:54] beginning yesterday morning
[1:19:57] if we are saved by grace through faith
[1:20:02] and and through the work of salvation we
[1:20:05] overcome
[1:20:06] sin by believing the truth
[1:20:10] that's the greatest deception there is
[1:20:12] right the power that sin holds over us
[1:20:15] if god has by grace revealed to us
[1:20:18] the forgiveness forgiveness of our sins
[1:20:22] and we've overcome a lie that we believe
[1:20:24] the truth and believe in the truth we're
[1:20:26] sanctified and we've come into new life
[1:20:28] we say the greatest accomplishment in my
[1:20:30] life is sin is defeated i've been
[1:20:32] quickened by a new birth
[1:20:33] i'm a son or daughter of god i've been
[1:20:34] baptized into christ if that
[1:20:36] dynamic if that was the greatest if
[1:20:38] saved being saved
[1:20:40] and overcoming sin by a revelation of
[1:20:42] truth by revelation of my salvation if
[1:20:44] that's the greatest
[1:20:45] then how much more powerful should the
[1:20:47] revelation of truth be for
[1:20:49] over everything else
[1:20:53] i know i'm not expressing myself the
[1:20:55] right way
[1:20:56] i i know just maybe just it's through my
[1:20:59] own
[1:20:59] i know it's through my own weakness and
[1:21:01] the things that i've struggled with
[1:21:03] uh just maybe physically being in pain
[1:21:06] i know i'm failing to make this point
[1:21:08] and so i ask god to help me
[1:21:09] if god by revelation delivered you from
[1:21:12] sin
[1:21:13] and that power has rescued you from the
[1:21:16] threat of hell
[1:21:17] and put you in god's grace to never have
[1:21:20] to worry about judgment
[1:21:21] that you have been placed already seated
[1:21:23] in the heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:21:25] if that kind of revelation delivered you
[1:21:28] from the worst kind of death there is
[1:21:30] and from the greatest power there is
[1:21:32] then how much more
[1:21:33] power is there when i say more power i'm
[1:21:36] talking about
[1:21:37] how much more powerful is it over
[1:21:39] everything else in life
[1:21:42] to have the kind of conviction that well
[1:21:44] if it delivered me from the death of sin
[1:21:47] then certainly i could be delivered from
[1:21:49] this if the revelation of truth rescued
[1:21:52] me from the bondage of false doctrine
[1:21:54] and broke the powers of demonic spirits
[1:21:56] and delivered me from addictions and
[1:21:58] set my life on this path then it's got
[1:22:00] to be more powerful than what should we
[1:22:02] do in this situation because i don't
[1:22:04] know
[1:22:07] this is the this is how practical your
[1:22:08] experience with christ can become
[1:22:10] when you realize that he's given you the
[1:22:12] revelation of the son of man when he's
[1:22:13] asked you to call upon him for
[1:22:14] revelation more than anything
[1:22:16] it's not oh god help me to see the seven
[1:22:18] thunders in the book of ezekiel oh lord
[1:22:20] let me be able to figure out how the
[1:22:21] jews
[1:22:22] if they had seals and if they had church
[1:22:23] ages and lord please let me be able to
[1:22:25] chart just the bright age perfectly and
[1:22:27] let me do no no no ask god for the
[1:22:29] revelation you really need
[1:22:32] for the moment that you're living in
[1:22:34] listen if it's a revelation of how to
[1:22:35] chart the bright age that's going to get
[1:22:37] us out of here let's all start calling
[1:22:38] upon god for it
[1:22:41] but we need revelation more than
[1:22:42] anything of who christ
[1:22:44] revelation of him it's practical
[1:22:48] it's practical if we could just stand to
[1:22:50] our feet this morning
[1:23:00] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:23:17] our gracious heavenly father
[1:23:23] through any strain or difficulty lord
[1:23:26] today in
[1:23:28] my delivery or cadence emphasis
[1:23:32] lord it could even be a failure for
[1:23:36] myself to get completely out of the way
[1:23:38] i still believe that you can communicate
[1:23:40] to your people
[1:23:42] through your word i still believe and
[1:23:43] know that you have
[1:23:45] because lord i can sense that you're
[1:23:46] dealing with hearts i could sense that
[1:23:48] there's
[1:23:49] real things that are being dealt with
[1:23:51] within people's lives
[1:23:54] and lord my prayer today
[1:23:57] is small give me wisdom
[1:24:03] give me practical wisdom

[1:24:09] even as powerful as it could be to be
[1:24:11] able to read people's thoughts
[1:24:14] if i don't have the wisdom to be able to
[1:24:15] handle what people are thinking
[1:24:17] it's going to destroy me lord i don't
[1:24:20] want to know people's thoughts i don't
[1:24:22] want to know
[1:24:22] everything that's being said and
[1:24:27] i don't want to know any more than what
[1:24:28] you want me to know lord
[1:24:31] but what i do want is wisdom with what i
[1:24:33] do know
[1:24:36] art i want a discernment and a
[1:24:37] perception about what i'm being
[1:24:38] confronted with in the situations i'm
