TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first kings chapter 17 and we begin with verse 8 first kings chapter 17 verses 8 to 16. we welcome all of our visitors that are here today may god be your portion and we appreciate the show of love and kindness towards us to come visit us and show support during this time of beginning for a new church first kings chapter 17 verses 8 to 16 and the word of the lord came unto him saying and speaking to elijah who has just now been fed at the brook cherith uh for many days by ravens but now the book dries up and it says the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get to this airpath which belongeth to zidan and dwell there and behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water and a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil and a cruise and behold i'm gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of mill shall not waste neither shall the crucifoil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saint of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of mill wasted not neither did the cruce of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah amen let's bow our heads and go to the lord in prayer our gracious heavenly father lord we're so thankful once again to have a body that we can gather with a people that share a precious faith to stand shoulder to shoulder with those that love your word and come with expectation lord we're grateful to be gathered with those that are just searching and with the hunger in their hearts for something from you lord we're grateful that we could create an atmosphere that the the hurting and the confused could come searching and feel love and find a place of rest lord we're happy if we only sojourn for a short time with the traveler and provide some respite or nourishment or ministering for lord we realize that we're just all part of a great body we're each one doing what we feel we are called to do to serve a greater purpose and not our own and lord we're so thankful to be part of we use the phrase agenda but we're so grateful to be part of an agenda and a purpose that is greater than our own personal agendas we're so grateful to be part of something that's supernatural that climax is not with the renown of a name and the renown of an individual or the lifting up of a personality but will climax with the meeting in the air where and we see you face to face and lord we desired that we would take our loved ones with us in that lord we desire to even see our neighbors impacted by this word we desire to see that you would have the preeminence in people's lives to the point of a new birth a maturing and a change of their bodies and lord as we see that that is by election and predestination our service would not stop only to those who could experience the change of their bodies but lord may our lives and our testimony and our purpose extend beyond that lord and be an expression of love and opportunity to those who are less fortunate and lord may we live with the type of character that is admirable not only in your eyes lord but in the eyes of of other of men that they see in integrity and an honesty and lord i pray today that as we have gathered in your presence you would take the word and speak to us as only you can as there's so many open hearts lord today i feel that there should be nothing hindering the word from going forth lord as i in my minds i look out upon the congregation lord i know that there's needs that need to be met and they can only be met by your word so now father individually not myself confessing as one that would speak but now father individually is those that will hear we lay aside our own filter we lay aside our own expectations that would be our own ideas of what we need and we say lord you feed me what i personally have need of today bless this word may it be a strength to us i pray have preeminence now father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen he may be seated we're continuing on the subject of in the beginning god created and we're coming to the climax of a family and it's something that is embodied in that creation of a family that was expressing something about god and his nature and that's uh and that's why we can come to and arrive at this in the beginning god created we look in the beginning we see the word then we see god acting to create he created heavens and earth we could look at angels and supernatural beings that we could see the earth and the universe and the planets and the stars and all those things that are therein and so there's a lot that is mentioned or meant in the phrase in the beginning god created there's so much that transpires in genesis chapter one and chapter two but we're arriving to what god's ultimate of his creation was where he climaxes in his creation to that point is we see a family and brother branham makes this statement we've been drawing from this in paragraph 176 of the masterpiece notice the great masterpiece of the family and he refers to it god's great masterpiece the masterpiece family that's adam and the woman in the garden every seed bringing forth of its kind and this is what brother branham is pointing to is kind of god's great work that makes him a master that he was achieving and wanting to represent in uh of his purpose and who he was now we realized that in that picture it was in some ways a negative of what god would begin to express in christ and his family that would really come forth of his body and of his being but we see it first expressed in a man and a woman and brother man calls it a masterpiece great masterpiece of the family or he uses the express phrase masterpiece family and now he begins to describe what that would have looked like and he says in dozens of places adam and eve were in harmony and perfect love and there was no death and perfect understanding of the love of god and describes that continuity that harmony and that union of the two and he says the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one so now he begins to use a language that would suggest that family is not just merely relationship or blood relation but it's something that he's trying to point out that you're characterized by they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way and the husband another that would make an awful family and so now he begins to describe it's not just a family but there's something about the family that made it a masterpiece but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family he says and now that was god's masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that now this is kind of our um a statement on a true family a masterpiece family a uh all true family portrays that kind of taking that phrasing that he says all true family here so a true family on earth today portrays this masterpiece family that god was bringing forth in the beginning now i realize in saying that that kind of creates a real heavy standard and it kind of creates the benchmark and that's one why we express the things that we did on wednesday night on uh not taking certain conception preconceived ideas and filter what the word of god is saying and filter it to achieve some kind of perfect picture that you're trying to achieve no we're just yielding to the word of god and letting him have his way and if he says you're going to be perfect don't fight it well if i'm going to be perfect lord it's going to be something you're going to do right if i'm going to be perfect it's going to be by a perfect blood it's going to be about a perfect word i'm not going to make myself that so so much of it is just yielding so much of it is just getting out of the way and i remember first time i met sister brenda lewis and um and i and it was i felt it was just a real privilege to be able to meet her she'd written so many tremendous songs and the message and i remember saying god bless you sister brenda how are you doing she said i'm just trying to keep out of his way and i thought amen to that that that's my that's my theme i'm just trying to keep out of his way if you get out of his way guess what you can become a masterpiece so it's not that god gives you an image that you need to try to make yourself into and you're going to try to filter your life to create this perfect picture in this facade let them start doing something on the inside and then a lot of it has nothing to do with what we think in the natural because for a lot of people the natural pitch pictures marred and what we want to become is what god in the beginning saw us that we were going to be in his image according to the word i mean you think about uh you just think about jesus i realize there's such a tremendous pull in liberty this morning so i'm really just going to relax myself and just follow wherever you drag me but if we took the image of a masterpiece family a man and a woman and we and we carnally filter things out and say this is what makes a masterpiece where does that leave jesus he's considered an illegitimate child never marries never has children lives a whole a single life and and so we can take the word of god and begin to beat ourselves down because of our situation not realizing look at christ what christ expressed and what he manifested and didn't fall short of the image so we we can't be carnal and pretty much now we could just sing take the name of jesus with you because in a lot of ways that's just what i'm trying to express is it's the word the image that we're trying to come into not our carnal understanding of what these things mean but this is what god wants to achieve and he says god's masterpiece was a family a true family in agreement in harmony and love and then he's saying a true family here portrays that and we were looking at last time this is just kind of trying to review to put some building blocks out there again how that there was an image in heaven and creation began to reflect that image and so god first created an unseen realm unseen to our natural eye unseen to these dimensions of light time and space that we live in and then as god created on earth it began to reflect something in heaven we saw that example when moses built the tabernacle he built it after the temple the tabernacle he saw in heaven and then ephesians 3 15 speaking of the father and also the son of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named so the whole family in heaven it shows that god has set a pattern in heaven of the family so there's an order there's an arrangement there's relationship there's structure to the family and then now he's saying there's a family in earth and brother saying that you as a family here are to portray a masterpiece family and the perfect image of the masterpiece family is in heaven and so we desire that what is done in heaven is also done in earth that's what we pray let it be done in earth let thy will be done now in earth as it is in heaven so whatever image is expressed in heaven that's what i want to express here on earth and so what we were ending in is how that god has commissioned you and you should look at his eye as an individual whatever family situation he's placed me in whatever relationships i'm sharing familial and even be through friendships and church relationships were commissioned to manifest his image to bear a heavenly image and therefore if god has commissioned you to do something it's very beautiful god never commissions without equipping he's never going to tell you to go do something without giving you the tools or resources to do it and i could be told to do something and my dad could say son go build the shed and i just say well i need the tools he'll say the tools are tools are in that shed well i need the i need the wood and here they are here they are and he could give me all the tools and all the all the materials and the nails and the wood and the concrete and he could give them to me and you know what i still wouldn't be able to build a shed i could watch youtube video after youtube video i i just i would need more i would need some kind of know-how some kind of experi experience some kind of talent or gift to be able to build the shed and make it worth using and so in the natural we realize many times we have resources we have tools we have materials we have everything we need but it just seems like something's lacking to pull it all together and pull it off and some people in life we realize they just have the knack to do it they're just born with a particular knack i've got the golf clubs i've got the golf balls i've got the nice pants i've got the hat i've got the golf club membership and i just can't seem to get the ball in the hole unless i'm eight over on the whole and then some people are just able to do it and that we experience that in the natural but when it comes to achieving god's goal for us in the spiritual you're not lacking he's providing resources material and the gifts and talents necessary to achieve it he'll provide it all and he'll see that you accomplish it so you've been commissioned in this way to express these things and again we're removing the filter we want to take god's word as it comes to us just as it is now i want to pick back up in genesis chapter 2 verse 22 and just laying some things out there that are uh somewhat of a review and forming a basis for where we're wanting to go today and god sees man it's not good that man should be alone i need to make him help me someone that will assist him in his labor someone that will be able to be another part of himself to fulfill the commission of genesis 1 28. it says and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man what a powerful powerful phrase so remarkable we're identifying how that god just did not merely say i put adam to sleep i took a part of him and i made flesh but he identified the rib and the rib itself speaks of sight or chamber the word is even used of chambers rooms or cells in the tabernacle it's even used of the wood that was used to create certain rooms and elements of the tabernacle which later were overlaid with gold and so what is it what is it speaking to it's speaking to flesh being being covered in deity flesh being made made word and and god is reflecting these things in the tabernacle and so from the rib he took building materials this is the building material of the woman there's so much that's beautifully represented in using the rib it says made he a woman that's eshop and it speaks of a wife he didn't just make a female man was already male and female but now that he brings out a fleshly expression of the woman he is no longer adam but he becomes ish he becomes husband says she came from man she becomes wife so male and female have moved to another expression now by relationship husband and wife now the the word i want to focus on today just for a few moments is it says made he a woman the word they're made is bana which means to build even to it's used to rebuild but it means to establish or cause to continue so there's something that god is expressing that you have man who's the original then he makes a woman so this is a continuation of the man and the word is literally used in and has this meaning in the hebrew to build a house or to establish a family so when god made the woman you we have to understand what god's trying to accomplish what god is representing in making this woman so it means to build a house or to establish a family made he a woman made he a wife what is the woman going to be she's going to be a homemaker what is what is she going to what is she going to do she's going to be one that continues the family through her is going to come a son so the family is unfolding he it was male and female to man and woman now husband and wife this is god's masterpiece that's unfolding from the man and then in genesis 3 16 god speaks of the woman and says that she shall bring forth children that has been that's the word there has been that word ben which is son comes from bana which made he a woman what is the son he's made he's made from a union he is in the jewish use of the word heber the son is a builder of the family name so you have man who is male and female he now he now has a woman that's brought out of him and now you have the woman and man is not just male and female now he's male as a ish as a husband and the woman is not just female but she's wife and now husband and wife as the woman in the very her very genesis and her makeup and when she's being formed she is one that's going to be used to build a family she's going to be one that establishes a family so adam and the woman are going to make a family and then when a son comes forth he's a further expression and he's a builder of the family name so god was building a family when he made the woman and brought her out of adam and this is a reflection of the family that god would ultimately achieve and build through his son jesus christ so the left the left side or the right side agrees so now we i was preaching a meeting one time and i asked how many here have an android phone and to my left everyone on the left raised their hand or if there was any hands or is all on the left said how many here own an iphone and everyone on the right raising they had literally divided the uh the congregation by android and iphone and this was maybe not quite third world but it was quebec and uh and it was it was really staggering that it divided along those lines and then just to kind of you could read into it all you want the right side was sisters and the left side was brothers and uh who had the better camera for selfies but we got a really good amen from the left side of the right side of the congregation today when we mentioned how that the first family was just a reflection of the ultimate family that god was going to build to his son jesus christ that's better so the this type that god is bringing forth in adam and the woman is the first flesh type the first type in flesh of the dwelling place of god that the son jesus or christ and his daughter the son and the daughter god's son and god's daughter man and wife church in bridegroom bride bridegroom would express later on so hearing god in the beginning adam and eve become the first flesh type of the dwelling place of god that christ which is the son of god and his daughter the daughter which is the bride become because god is going to dwell in his people he's going to become one with this people in isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 it says thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool now these are i was had wanted to use this scripture in the past and i kept kind of bringing it out of out of my notes because it represents again in one picture heaven and earth somehow being connected having some harmony and continuity having a connection to each other heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool now we read that like footstool oh it's just something that's made subject and under his feet but it speaks of a resting place footstool is a resting place and you'll find that in the scripture the footstool is the place of worship so heaven is the throne a place of authority and a place of power but then when he makes the earth his footstool we don't look at it as like something under your feet and you look under your feet you see all the crumbs and all the dirt and everything no the footstool is a place where the feet would be rested and then even in the scripture and the psalms in different places and and david even speaking when you want to build a tabernacle the tabernacle the temple and the place of worship the where the ark rested it was called the footstool because that's a place of worship and so he god is it his heaven is in the throne is in heaven but the place of worship and rest is is on earth this is what's being expressed in the tabernacle in the wilderness and even in the temple then he says where is the house that you build and demean in other words how can you contain the infinite god how are you going to build a house for god and where is the place of my rest who can contain my fullness where is the place that i'm going to find rest and many scholars would read this and say that god is essentially saying you can't do it or there is no place but we realize that there's something that's being expressed here by prophecy in isaiah 66 and maybe by rhetorical question by inquiry uh who's worthy to take the seals and loose them and we know there was one to do it but where is where house will you build where is the place in my rest we realize today that the body is his place of rest paul when he takes this scripture and he writes it in acts chapter 7 verse 49 what are luke writes it actually what house will you build me there this word that house is used what house will you build me this house in the hebrews baith which means a family of descendants what house what household will you build me it speaks of a family what house will you build me and the word is household what family are you going to build me it comes from bana when made he a woman bana he a woman and a a wife an isha it's the same word that is used to create the bring forth children ben which comes from benad now what house will you build me from but not to build a house to establish a family so there's a theme that's being connected here there's something being expressed and paul or luke when he writes it what house you build me in the expression of paul bringing this old testament prophecy in what house it means stock or race or the descendants of one that's the word that's used in the greek so he said what family am i going to become who is going to be the bearer of my name in whom am i going to dwell through whom am i going to be expressed so now brother brennan makes this statement so i'm wanting you to relate a lot of this to on the spiritual side i have this connection to where i am not just a i'm not just a human being that's identified by my natural parents but that god somehow is as much as it's beyond me being able to fully understand and explain to someone that the moment i was even born to my natural mother that god had a supernatural seed ordained for me and that i was in his mind before i ever came forth in flesh and so i have a greater identity in the word than i even do through my natural family think about brother branham he often spoke not very kind about his family you know i i'd be condemned these are my words but he said my dad was a bootlegger my mom was this and he wouldn't brag on he'd often say if if we're looking at the branham if we're all going by branham then then we're he was like then what do i have to show for what what can i give and what's my reputation what's my character and what's my position but once you relate it to the fact that you've been called to a higher order and a higher position in the family of god then you look back and say god you can use whatever my family experiences whatever my family history is because you looked out after it because you allowed it and so it must have some purpose and utility within the context that i have in the greater family in the ultimate family and that being the family of god that way there's no outcast in the family of god i like to teach it this way there's no tonsils right in the body of christ that part of kind of uh we don't think we need you right there there's no appendix in the body of christ well brother you're a little inflamed so we're gonna just cut you out nope every part's necessary so we we have utility we have use we have function we're part of a a greater supernatural design my wife and i were discussing it uh i believe this morning on how that our types are types are not truths in themselves and types are not proofs and so if you use the body as a type of the of the church of the even the local church the local body and just as the body has parts that minister nourishment one to another and you say well if the body is so then you look at the type you don't use the type to produce a proof or a truth they can just be facts but the truth is the word and she said i made her head spin so if your head's spinning then you know you you and my wife can commiserate later but the point is this we get the truth from the word whatever the word says is the truth then we don't look to the type and say well you know what in the body we get rid of the appendix or you know we can amputate limbs and we can we can change that's not that's like you're going beyond the type the type is as god has fitly joined together the natural body and each part has a utility and ministers nourishment we're only using that as a type for the truth that's unchanging that we work and function within the body of christ in harmony in every part has a place even the uncomely parts are are honored and revered right and so that's what we lift up that's what we look to so there's something supernatural about this position that we've been given in the body of christ now in the message who is this melchizedek brother adam's quoting from john 1 1 he says in the beginning was the word now let me just reset again that when god made the woman she was going to be part of establishing a family a child comes from that same expression and those same phrasing in those words that he is now a carrying on of the family man woman children this is an expression of god and it's a dwelling place it's expressing a dwelling place of god what house will you build me so god is wanting to ultimately become a family that he dwells in or becomes that he's identified with and brother branham says using john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god now he skips several verses and he says and the word became flesh and dwelt among us by the way i'm connecting now john 1 1 with i believe verse 12. and he says hold that there now notice his first being with spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body so god in the beginning is invisible then he forms himself into a theophany and notice the phrase that brother branham uses he's forming himself toward flesh he's not flesh then when he's formed into the theophany it's a body it's the word the logos in the beginning was the word that's god now forming himself and still a supernatural expression of the invisible god but god is moving towards flesh in other words that created a momentum that god is saying i want to take on flesh and if you want to know what i'm talking about just see it now in a type in adam and the woman and then he becomes flesh in jesus christ so in hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering that what is not but a body thou hast prepared me what is this body it's the flesh that god began to form himself towards in john 1 and in the beginning so brother man says god prepared himself a body in the form of the lord jesus and colossians tells us for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily so now we see something coming forth this is the dwelling place of god this is the beginning of the creation of god this is now god bringing into perfect realization what he was reflecting and manifesting in the garden of eden and so if this is the masterpiece jesus christ and in him dwells the fullness then we know in the original image and in the type in this this expression in the garden there's must come forth there must be a bana there must be a building and an establishing of the family here's the sun now there must come forth a woman and paul picks up on the revelation ephesians 1 22-23 and it says and have put all things under his feet speaking of christ and gave him to be the head over all things to the church so christ is the head and he's placed all things under his feet now listen how paul defines the church what is the church which is his body so the church is the body christ is the head the fullness of him that filleth all in all so when christ dwelled all the fullness of the godhead bodily now there comes forth a body a church which is his body which is going to be the fullness of him that filleth all in all there's the replenishing of the earth there's the feeling up in the full expression the supreme fulfillment of what god was envisioning in the beginning so there's a spiritual part that we're all playing in this expression of the masterpiece family because brother ram says and now the masterpiece family has come again christ and his bride ready to come he calls it the second adam the second eve ready now to return back to their home and the whole picture has been redemption because the bible begins with the broken family you talk about family conflict i mean genesis chapter four is pretty heavy hey i mean genesis chapter three a husband and wife arguing and and disagreeing and husband blaming the wife and right i mean you don't have to go beyond genesis 3 and genesis 4 maybe in some ways to be comforted about your situation and so the family the family picture in the beginning wasn't very pretty it was for a moment but what began to unfold was very difficult but it says but the whole picture has been redemption but god wanted to express in the beginning god created the heaven and earth and what the earth was chaotic that's the first expression but the whole picture has been redemption so now we want to take this a step further i think those things could just perhaps may have been uh better suited for the last time but it helps just to build a foundation brother says in the beginning was the word and now he brings forth this expression of the masterpiece family and how that christ god was moving himself towards flesh so in the beginning was the word then god created a family so the first family was after the word it wasn't in the beginning was a family and then god created the word you say well brother aaron if i came to church this morning to figure you know to hear that i didn't have to come to church i'm just wanting to think about it the word was first and then after the word the family came and then the family was then made subject to the word so brother branham says in the masterpiece the masterpiece was wall speaking of the family walled by the word god's word and he uses the phrase fortified by the word so the family was fortified made strong or secured by the word fortified me was given strength by the word so if you're fortified by something the word was the source of power the word was the source of protection the family was fortified by the word he uses the phrase a few places they were walled by the word and how they went beyond the wall and that's what caused the fall wall it speaks of boundaries parameters foundation so there's something that defined the family family couldn't just be any kind of relationship family couldn't just be a any designation that you wanted to give it god had a very specific expression of the family now we could even acknowledge that today the the nominal christians and and denominations and certain even political organizations would say a family is defined as a man and a woman right and and so they're trying to go back to the biblical perspective that god sets forth now we can say that god in the beginning walled god's masterpiece so he's putting a frame around it and saying this is the word and this is what makes a family this is a true family this is a masterpiece family he says an identified masterpiece of god and god told adam what he could do and what he could not do he placed himself he placed him behind his word and he begins to describe how the enemy crawled through the walls of god's word and that's how he marred the image and he says that's one of the saddest stories to think that the man was made in the image of his creator and was given a wall to stand behind and that that word could never fail so where in the beginning was the word and then when god made the family he was framing them by the word the word was the context the word was the parameters the word was what brought it into view the word is what made sense of what the family was without the word you wouldn't understand what it was so he says this and take on the whole armor of god the enemy knew as long as the human race stayed with that word he'd never be able to touch them this is this is very instructive as long as the human race stayed with the word god fortified his family on the earth his army in the fortification of his word that the fort of his word that is our fortress so he uses maybe a a military analogy to say that god has built us a base he's built us a fortification he's built us a fort we we are we are not in in fort st john we're not in fort worth we're in fort worth right that's where god has established us that's where he's built he's built up the walls this isn't for brave for those of you who use playmobil he's established us in the word we have a word as our fortress and as long as you're in there you're good as long as you're in there he won't be able to touch you as long as he's in there you won't be marred as long as you're there you can't be tore down and so satan recognizes this now this is brother branham showing this to me i framed him by the word i put him behind the word the fortification was the word now he says this later in identified masterpiece of god this is brother bam trying to show the evolution of of this and when he made his first masterpiece he put him behind the word when he made a second masterpiece he was the word amen i'm getting a little bit more encouraged today i'm starting to feel like you know what this this flesh has a chance because he put the first masterpiece which was in flesh behind the word which meant he could get outside the word he was walled by the word which means there's something the enemy could crawl under or get around but now he makes you the word so it says he was the word not behind the word he was the word god never changes his plan that's exactly what he started off to do his first church with the word in other words if christ the second adam the last adam was not behind the word but the word and the woman is to come off of him then you are the same material as the bridegroom you're not merely behind the word you are the word this has been expressed through several other services expressed by you know it's been preached by the the men of god for decades that you are the word the bride is the word now there's got to be an individual connection to this that there is something that god is doing now through the through the word of god to where i'm not afraid of leaving the word of god and going out from behind the word of god and satan married my life permanently in god having to start a cycle of redemption all over again but i have been ordained to declare and to manifest the word of god i'm not merely behind the word of god so i can step out of the word of god but i am now becoming the word this is the pattern and what did god show adam and the woman were placed behind the word and israel was placed behind the word and so they always related naturally to the promise they had to come once a year and identify with the sacrifice and so this was a pattern they were behind the word they were behind the word but they had not become the word it was only through the seed of abraham which speaks of christ that you could become the word so just as israel was behind the word and adam and the woman were behind the word through the second adam we can become the word and the bride is the word amen now in these very this very energizing and exciting and thrilling principle that feeds us as bride members that identifies as the bride members god is setting forth maybe the most important pattern for individuals and families he's setting forth a a clear and distinct pattern for us even as this word has practical application in our lives you say i'm the word i'm the word well what does that look like right what what is what does the word look like it's to be like christ okay be born of a virgin you know right and uh confound the fairs the the priest at 12. what is it what does it look like what does it look like from 12 to 30 the silent years of christ so it's brother i said the life lived by the word would be the word expressed so it's it's it's what it looks like in life something that has to be expressed and relationships and obligations and responsibilities and duties provide the context for us to be christ-like for an opportunity to do do the right thing and i want so i want to use this phrase brother brown called brother uh said of god he is the extreme parent you think you're a helicopter parent or you know i'm all in on motherhood or you know i'm a real dad uh don't ever say i babysit my kids those are my kids i you know i i father them just like mom mothers them and uh and we have all those kind of phrases that we use and uh and our objections if the wife says well he's at home babysitting the kids i don't babysit my kids that's my flesh and blood you know you're not paying me 20 bucks an hour to watch somebody else's kids but so but god is the extreme parent so in the true in the purest sense as jesus said if your natural father if you asked your natural father for an egg would he give you a rock in the purest sense god is an extreme parent he said brother brown said that parenthood originated in god because he was the first parent he says in another place he is the source he is the source of all parenthood so this is these are just some phrases now to ponder about god parenthood originated god he's the first parent he's the source of parenting and brotherhood says one place fatherhood is an attribute of god now right there we can begin to come we could begin to identify something that when when man when adam became from adam to each you say well that was a transition because his relationship changed and and that we can understand that naturally but then if you could realize that in doing so he was actually stepping into an office that god held himself or that was a characteristic of god then it kind of changes what it's ex the promise behind it or the potential of it so being a parent is not just the ability to bring forth a child but it actually brings you into an office which is god-like or god himself holds so you can say god as a parent i want the the power and the wisdom and the strength and the ability that you possess as a father and as one that is extreme the extreme parent your office as a husband is connected with god's office as a husband your office as a wife as a spouse is connected with this office that god is as a spouse your office as a parent is connected with god's calling and his characteristics and his attributes as a parent now and and i want to express this because we're continuing on how we're wanting to convey it in the sense that god being the extreme parent is establishing a pattern and in the beginning was the word and then the family came next so god is demonstrating something extremely important and this is a principle that we not only catch and acknowledge but we live by it and i let me express this i'd love to amplify this statement further brother branham says your family is what you are and we all go no i'm not the one that got kicked out of louisiana youth camp right immediately the name geary just everyone just assumes so were you a white wizard too did your dad give you all duckies when you were little yeah there's something about the name right and the testimonies and the uh and the things and behaviors and the stories and all those you're identified by your name so he realized yes this is a statement your your family is what you are and brother i'm talking about in natural life we're identified in our marriages and don't go it's just true it's just the realitive in the natural not even talking about christians not even talking about believers and those things but in the natural we are identified in our marriage we're known by our family by our family name the certain attributes and behaviors and history of the family we derive our character even from our family influence so when you are born into a family you receive the nature of your parents and then as you are raised in a family you receive the nurture of your parents and your extended family and even your environment the neighborhood your social climate these all become nurturing influences on the nature it produces a particular expression so it says your family is what you are brother brahms identify that family dynamics make a person what they are and it's an operation of nature and nurture and so that's the reality we get that we understand that but instead of just locking up and freezing saying well that's the truth i'm in a box realize this that is what you are in the natural so your family is what you are in the natural then and you're identified by nature and nurturing all those things then think about the greater promise that you're part of the family of god and so therefore the word is what you are spiritually and if i could put it this way the word is what you are really it's really what you are and so you're identified by your union with the word you're identified you're known by your family which is the word you derive your character from this heavenly family from the word of god from the influence of the word so now you are under a divine promise to live a different expression that is breaking and transcending whatever family history it is i think about brother tom ray's testimony when he had he had family members died of a very young age and i believe it was because perhaps heart disease or some other ailment and he went into the doctor and they're very concerned about family history and his brother passed away his father passed away he went in to see the doctor and the doctor was doing some tests and he says you got a different dna and you know brother tom glory right immediately he's like you got that right buddy i i don't don't place on me my family history don't place on me uh family hang-ups and family complexes and family cycles yes those things are there but i believe the word of god is sent to deal with those it's all about redemption it's all about new beginnings let's just say right now and purpose in our hearts i can't change the past but the future can change me i can't change the past but what i'm called to can change the present what god has called me to be can change who i am now and do nothing about the past and listen today then is the day we're living in the harvest time the seed comes through we're living in a time when there's a union of the natural with the spiritual so then there is there's an expression then of what you are naturally harmonizing with what you are spiritually that we can purpose in our hearts as we have opportunity today that i can let the word have preeminence in my life so that there's not such a dichotomy and a separation of what i am naturally in my relationships in my family in my individual life and what the word of god has called me to be but now the natural flesh is becoming word and it's union time it's time to unite what we are naturally and your family is what you are in what we are spiritually in your families what you are so that even as families as single people as grandparents as aunts and uncles and as members of a church we find our identity in our expression through the word of god that they unite together it's all about letting christ have preeminence now i i'm uh you guys are dragging me all over the place so in the message conflict between god and satan and coming back to this this quote that was up there a moment ago now i i want to try to go quickly through this because god god is setting forth something that's very instructive to us very practical um it's something that we uh we really need to grab a hold of what's being uh expressed here and we'll revisit it perhaps in the future in eden god knew his enemy and all the attacks of his enemy so based upon that brother adam says after a couple statements and knew that he would have children on this earth his own blessed children don't you believe that god that he would provide for them the best that he could provide now put yourself in the position as a parent and realize as a parent i want to provide what's best for my children and by that it means i don't want to just buy them some kind of knock off handheld video game i want to get the the switch right i don't want to buy a used sega genesis at a garage sale i want to get the ps5 and that's how we begin to think i want to get them the best i want i want to provide the best but because this is an instinct of parenthood he would provide for them the best would he not do it he says knowing the enemy knowing the challenges knowing what's coming would not you tonight to your children that was helpless little fellows who can't take care of themselves don't you struggle and work and do everything that you can to provide the best you can or able to provide for those children amen that's what motivates the mothers in the morning to get out of bed that's what motivates the fathers to go to work because you are a father a parent and if that be what i say the trueness and the thought of an earthly parent and parenthood originated to god because he was the first parent don't you think that god seeing what satan would be what satan would do he gave to his children and provided for them the best thing they could be provided for them knowing what the enemy's attack would be god fortified his children just skipping just a little bit god knew this great warfare was coming between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy was going to do he know just exactly how to equip his people this instinct to equip this instinct to um to fortify was based upon god knowing there was challenges ahead and let me rephrase it god as a father as a parent being able to discern and recognize there's troubles coming ahead and being proactive as a parent and providing proactively fortification resources tools rules things that he could give his children to live by that would protect them and guide them in the onslaught to come that even they the children couldn't foresee the children have no idea they're not even they're not even in a particular expression yet to be able to relate to these challenges but god knowing what was coming this is the instinct of parenthood this is an instinct of a father knowing what was coming he gave him the best and what did he fortify him with the word paragraph 60 but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon that doesn't seem to be too wise maybe to give your children an atomic bomb because he's the infinite god now sin there is going to be a conflict and there's going to be a battle we're remembering this phrase from last year god equipped his children with the right kind of an ammunition right kind of attack right kind of everything defense offense protection whatever it is that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from eden and god knowing there would be a fall to the rapture the word that god gave adam and the woman in the beginning actually was a word that anticipated and prophesied of a fallen people on earth who would one day before death ever had existence god had prophesied its defeat before it ever been manifested god prophesied as defeat that this word i give in the beginning the bride is going to manifest in the end and take it into a rapture he says what was it the word that's what defeat satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place so this is instructive to us just take this in in the brief moment that will amplify that we then do the same thing as parents if god being the extreme parent god being the first parent god being fatherhood being an attribute of god then this principle is true that we likewise want the word to be something we fortify our families with literally in our families literally in our raising literally in the standards that we have in the home we look to the word of god to be a fortification that doesn't mean you go out and try to find word lumber and word stucco and word carpet and word no those are the building elements of a natural house but the things that make a house a home we look to the word to do that and it's a very scriptural principle so now i want to take this uh that may have just been a little bit of a veering but i want to emphasize this in a little bit different ways as we've kind of hit our home stretch rounding second headed to third and this is going to be an inside the park home run so we're going to make it we're going gonna get we're gonna get to home i don't know if i'll get in standing up if i'm gonna have to slide you'll determine that okay as one brother would said you just let me know when i'm done and it's almost like a dad joke i don't know how many pastors when i was traveling and evangelizing and uh would say but aaron you just preach as long as you want we're going to leave in an hour you just turn off the lights when you're done oh it's like a dad joke it's like a pastor joke right and you just kind of cringe dad and so the principle that we're wanting to express here and just look at is god as the extreme parent arranged his family behind the word that's an example we see but we realize in a spiritual sense we are the word so in in using types of the natural family the natural marriages say the natural marriage is a type of the union between christ and his bride but that doesn't mean all the all the problems we have in our natural marriages that we have in our spiritual marriage right because christ is at least the perfect husband and our marriage is lacking perfect husbands to have different problems than what christ and the bride have and so we're not trying to bring these types and work on making backwards compatible to force our marriages into a particular image and if they're not that then they're not the right one it's not that's not how we're looking at it so brother branham tells us the first family was arranged behind the word now we realize the spiritual type is greater but then they're ordered according to the word and we mentioned a moment ago this is the part i just want to emphasize over and over again for the next several moments i hope several is ambiguous enough for you just to stay with me the word was first the word was first the word was their protection it was their preservation in other words the word was going to protect them and if they followed the word it would actually preserve them and populate them or recreate them this is god's original program the true the true family in the beginning could not be replicated unless it was by the word so when adam and the woman produced offspring it wasn't the word producing offspring the image of the true family had already been broken so the word was their protection and also the word was their provision and it was their preservation and this is the lesson i want to emphasize in this this is what we're going to gather from this what are we what are we trying to learn from this particular uh phrasing that you're using brother aaron what are we trying to learn from this emphasis that you're giving the lesson is this family is not first family cannot be you cannot ever take family the principle of family the the idea family and raise it above the word so as much as we say in the beginning god created a family we can't take from that meaning that family is the ultimate and family is the most important family is what must be first and then we what happens we merely become identified by family we merely begin to see ourselves in terms of how our family dynamics are we say well you're identified by your marriage and this natural life then however my marriage is is who i am and we get it in this way to where that becomes the identifying factor that becomes the frame that becomes the image that becomes everything we are as family but that's not how god arranged it in the beginning the word was first so that means family doesn't have the preeminence family relationships do not have the preeminence but the word does family is not first so it's not like god gives us the word like thank you for the word and as i began to learn and understand the word i realized that family was more important so you take the word and go thank you lord and then and then join your family is i'm just working on my family and we're just throwing myself into my family and spending more time with my family brother aaron i'm just going to quit church for a year and i've been distracted by my prayer life and i find i'm just reading too much in the bible and i just really want to focus on my family all that time in prayer i'm going to spend it doing legos with my son and i'm actually going to i bought a bass boat and i'm going to take my other son out fishing every afternoon just gonna pour myself into my family give more time to my family and because we think well family is the ultimate so if i can somehow build the family right you don't need anybody to tell you i don't know brother you might want to rethink that we know that's not the image and that's why even the phrase and this is not to this is not a knock on adventures in odyssey but the phrase focus on the family can be somewhat misleading if unless it's qualified and i'm not suggesting that they are they they have been misled themselves in terms of what they mean behind the phrase focus on the family i haven't asked is it dr dawson maybe i'll just send them a dm later and ask what the motivation was to this but with unless you qualify focus on the family can be misleading and say we need to focus on the family and focus could mean we're going to converge on it we're going to make it the center to focus on something is you make it central you make it the center and if you make family the center if you make family the focus then you're wrong but if you look at it from the standpoint that focus is using the lens of god's word to produce a clear image of the family than to focus on the family's right i'm using the word lens i'm using the word of god to frame it i'm using the word of god to give it context and my focus on the family is through the word of god to get a clear image of what family is what my responsibilities are what the role is what the utility what it should look like then that's fine but if you focus on the family at the at the expense of the word of god where i'm kind of turning away from the word to focus on the family that's a dangerous place to be because the family is not the ultimate but if you take the word of god and use the word as a lens to bring the family into perspective and have a clear understanding of what your roles and responsibilities are as a son or daughter in the home that's good amen so then what we're wanting this is this is how i want you to take a hold of this today is so when we say in the beginning god created a family if we if we're suggesting that we might spend some time teaching on family roles and our responsibilities as husbands and wives and parents and those things it's not just a family that was the image of god but brother called it a true family that was the masterpiece so it had to be arranged under the word the first family had a very specific arrangement had a very specific order which made it god's masterpiece wasn't just relationship wasn't just title but it was the arrangement of it now let's ponder these scriptures as we go forward in this matthew chapter 19 verse 29. and and i want to read these and and in a way it really hits hard and every one that has forsaken houses which that houses means family it's a word used for family so it's not just you know moving from one address to another everyone who has forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundred fold and shall inherit everlasting life jesus is again once again being very particular and specific he doesn't just say everyone that has left things that are important and dear to them is going to be rewarded a hundredfold he kind of really gets down to where it hurts a little bit that if for his namesake for the word's sake if we forsake family our brother our sister our father our mother our wife for children there's going to be a reward of an of eternal life i mean this is he's put in very extreme ways almost in a sense you think are you exaggerating jesus but it's the truth and so the opposite stands we cannot forsake him for family sake he's telling us it's okay for the word's sake to forsake family it's okay for the word's sake to to follow truth and not let this family uh family identity and family politics and family ambitions and family goals keep you from following me because listen if you do so just know i am rewarder and i will restore and i will give back a hundredfold says one place in this life and the life to come so i think if i would just i would just say this if you've ever had to leave family to stand for truth don't close the door leave just as abraham did that day when he took his son up the hill to sacrifice him he said i and the lad are going up and by his own language he implied and we're coming right back down you just you keep that door open of restoration and though i may have to separate for some cause i'm not going to give up like abraham did on lot oh well i guess the world took them there they go the kings took them but no no let's gather our resources let's gather our servants let's pray let's send the holy ghost after him let's bring him back say i guess he just you know it wasn't of us that's not the right kind of attitude but yet jesus is saying this that we cannot forsake him for family sake in other words as i'm maybe taking what he's presenting here forsake houses brothers sister father mother wife or children for his sake we cannot deny the word of god for family sake we cannot compromise the word of god for family jesus is establishing an order here that the word is greater than the family family is not greater than the word but ponder this but when family reflects the word there's nothing greater so we're not kind of creating this box that you got to put family into but we have this ambition to say family's not greater than the word but if i can express the word there's nothing greater in matthew chapter 10 verses 34 to 35 i might actually i have mis represented there i might read to verse 37 a lot of this i type it by hand and so sometimes it may not actually be correct on there i have typos and different things i'm just trying to do it all it says think not that i'm come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace and we're thinking well isn't that what the angel said when you were born but a sword think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance which means to cleveland departs to separate to set man at variance against his father and and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law he never says the son-in-law gets the mother-in-law except but that's the one we always joke about it's not even scriptural dudes but i mean if our wives don't get along with our moms at least it's scriptural and the man's foe shall be they of his own household he that loveth father mother more than me is not worthy of me he that love a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me amen so now i believe that we have to be very careful to say well i'm come to set a man at variance against his father and he says he came to bring a sword i have been given a sword to set it variance means to cleave into two parts let's not carry this to the extreme and show up at our dad's doorstep with the sword and say i just want you to know today from this day on i've settled my relationship with you we are no longer we are set at variance because of the message of the hour no let's not get in the kind of platitudes and these kind of that kind of rhetoric but catch the point the basic precept he's trying to build the word must be honored above family the word must be honored above pleasing family members the word must be put first above placating relatives above placating children and children's ambitions and ideas and feelings and wants the word must be first so he's saying if the word ever stands in your way or hinders your service of the word excuse me if a family if with family would ever stand in your way obeying the word if a family would ever hinder your service to god then we must resist the interference and and we can't carry this to some of the the the the mean spirited uh carnal expressions that people have when they they'll turn people off even within the message say well light can't have fellowship with darkness and because you don't believe my doctrine we can't have fellowship and it's just taking on a non-christ-like tone i mean could you imagine if if uh if i if i there's something maybe i was teaching in the word of god and and you said to me well brother aaron i don't quite see it that way and i was like well you're clearly not under my ministry so you should probably find some other place to go to church you say well if i've ever seen a clear picture of christ i've seen it now i'm so sorry i believe everything you believe now right we just immediately were corrected and we realized we were so wrong because we're so compelled by the love of christ it doesn't make sense to us and so sometimes we take the very true word of god and we begin to use it as a blunt instrument to divide relationships to chase off children to alienate people and that's not the way that it ought to be used so these scriptures are setting forth a very important principle but let's not pervert them and make them something they're not if the family stands in your way you have to stand with the word we must resist the interference and he's really setting forth the principle that a christian should be ready to part from things that are most dearest to him even family for christ's sake especially if he asked for it brother branham says in the message power of transformation sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on earth to you to take your position that god has called you to i'm sure you could read between the lines what i'm saying sometimes the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them just take your position in christ to where god has called you that this this does not imply a fighting this does not imply swords being drawn he said shake hands not throw hands right right sometimes you have to throw hands take your position guys no shake hands brother god bless you but the lord's calling me brother god bless you but this is what i've got to do i've got to take my stance sometimes from the dearest person on earth you've got to separate he says but what is god doing transforming he says you have to shake hands take your position of christ to where god has called you this is personal this is individual what but what is god doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else so it's not always about well where your family is and what your family is doing and what your family identity is and this is where family always was this is where mom and dad are sometimes god will take you from where all your family history was where all your family is and he actually will take you outside of that and it's not throwing hands and it's not a warfare and it's not well you're awful and you're mean and i'm going somewhere else it's like i've got to take my position i feel god leading me i've got to be obedient to this calling god bless you we love you we support you we're keeping the door open but i've got to take this journey i've got to move my family i've got to sell my house i've got to separate maybe son or daughter from a lovely family but god is placing me somewhere else he said because it's his way of doing it by renewing your mind to obey the word of god listen regardless of what the price is sometimes that's what god does and we see this principle in scripture forsaking houses brothers sisters father mother or wife or children for my name's sake i i my the sword of the word of god can set at variance it doesn't mean there has to be literal hostility between father and son but it means that there's some there's some change or there's some difference between that there's a greater identity there's a greater hood that you put on it's a wordhood not just a parenthood or fatherhood or sonship in the natural there's a different headship that you come under and this is greater and more important listen to how he puts in luke chapter 14 verse 26 you want to hear a real doozy luke 14 26 if any man come to me and hate not his father so if you come to me to serve me and you don't hate your dad and you don't hate your mom and you don't hate your wife and you don't hate your children and your brother and your sister and hate your own life you cannot be my disciple listen we don't need the message translation we don't need the amplified bible we don't need just read it in this old king james and we get exactly what he's saying amen i'm picking up what you're laying down jesus and if we just take well maybe we don't but if we just took it at face value he's suggesting maybe in looking at it then i would say i'm sorry honey but god's called me to serve him so i hate you and he'll say well how come you don't tell me i love you or tell me that you love me anymore and you say well i hate you ever since i became a christian to serve god i got to hate you so i don't want to lie i don't want to speak something that's contrary to the word of god so every morning you wake up i'm going to confess the word of god i hate you honey because i want to put the word in my mouth and and eliza comes in all sleepy headed and she's all in can i get a hug i hate you i just want to put the word in my mouth because i'm sold out i'm all in i hate my sons i hate my daughter i hate my brother i hate my sister i hate my wife but jesus is using exaggeration to make his point it's actually i'd say better it's a figure of speech meaning you better love your family less than you love me he's not suggesting actual hostility towards your family actual hatred that if you don't hate your dead you really don't love me but he's actually saying there must be a greater devotion to the word of god there must be a greater connection infinity to the word toward this it never gets out of balance because if you take your natural filial love you have for your family and that's the same kind of love you have for me as an idea then there's ways that that can get flip-flopped and move around where you're never going to achieve the relationship that i desire to have with you but you must have this union with me in the word and a love for me and a bond for me in the word that transcends and graters this natural carnal love you have for your family but listen as you fall in love with him and that word has prim's i just love how it can catch that filial love and it can blend and confuse and you can love your wife correctly you can love your children correctly you can love even the family that has abused you and harmed you and hated you and alienate you but agape can come infuse and correct the filio and christ has preeminence and this is this is not a selfishness where now it's kind of like well i'm a christian so i i'm my i i i i i'm better i i don't love my family as much and it's there's no i in this this is christ where he is the he is the one that's coming into view this is actually a ref reordering of what our carnal instincts are it might initially kind of uh make you think like uh-huh see like i i've kind of had the right idea all along right that by the attitude i had and he said you gotta hate your father so i feel like i'm kind of on the right track you read that scripture i didn't realize how much more in the image of the word i was until i read luke 14 26. oh that's when you got to continue to read and understand what he's trying to say you realize oh i'm a little bit further away than i thought cause listen what brother branham says in blind bartimaeus he's speaking of blind bartimaeus he was a provider for his family he thought of his family first before himself and and this this creates the order now as father as a family head any real true daddle do that right any real truth you have true family a real true dad will do that or husband and i love this any christian will think of others before himself remember how you treat others you're treating christ it says any christian will think of others before himself every christian tries to put god first his family is second he's number three i think there was a big move a big thing that was i am second no i hope you didn't spend too much in that branding because now you need to do another trademark i am turd all right i'm not i'm not even number two i'm number three that's exactly what he's saying he's number three the person every christian puts god first his family second he's number three so all our family needs family harmony even family brokenness family distress or family ambition all these things cannot be placed over the word family is second so christ is first family a second and then you're number three so you're not even becoming the division or the one that separates family but now you begin to reorder everything and prioritize if i can put god first then family can properly be second but if god's not first put it in any order you want you know you can make your family first you can become second however you want to it's just not going to work god has to be first and if god is truly first there's just a way that god orders it or if it was you and you were second and as god begins to have the premise all of a sudden there's something about your nature as it begins to change in the sweetness of the holy ghost in the way that he changes you and the way that he deals with certain things all of a sudden now you realize you know what it's not all about me and you begin to take your place as number three very beautiful how that works god first family second and your last but we can only become number three through the humility of christ we're taught in matthew chapter 6 verse 33 as it brings into the image of food and drink and clothing and how that after all these things do the gentiles seek and they want to have nice things and and they want to provide and they want to have all these as a parent would for their children provide the best but all those things can make a house but it doesn't make a home having all those things doesn't make you more spiritual a man cannot brag that he's paid off his house he doesn't owe anything on his cars he doesn't have a credit card all his children wear the latest and and and all these different things and everything's in order and my wife and i you know we we all of our children are serving the lord and all of them are at home and we don't have a tv in our home and describing all these different things and we have and start describing all these natural elements but you can just do that by being disciplined you can just do that by taking certain rules and this is a prescription for for this but it's got to be a true ambition and a true goal as it says seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness so as we seek him first and his righteousness this is nature this is character this is life all these things shall be added unto you now if we get it in reverse families first i'm second our ambition can be naturally as a parent to be sure they're fed to be sure they're clothed be sure the mortgage is paid be sure they have all these things but my ambition is not seeking him first and though all these things have been added they're not necessarily blessings their possessions but if you seek first the kingdom of god he will add to you as blessing houses and lands and provision and substance and all these things food drinking clothing all these things will be added unto you what is this this is the kind of lifestyle that has prioritized the word has prioritized christ and through putting christ first family being second is the immediate beneficiary of your decision to make him number one and this only this can only be achieved then through the humility of christ i'm going to read i'm going to just kind of pick through this statement and how can i overcome brother branham's talking about how he made his first attack upon jesus so the temptation in the garden corresponds to the temptation of christ first adam and the woman now the last adam god tempting him or satan tempting him led of the spirit in the wilderness and he says he knew his position so now it's based upon knowing who he was his position satan come and wanted him to use his own power on himself to feed him and want to feed himself he was hungry a man gets hungry he can do almost anything still rob beg borrow anything he had that appetite now think of your instinct as a parent that if you don't know your position and you're only trying to satisfy cardinal need carnal urge things that that are necessary then you're willing to almost do anything to achieve it but satan used his great major salt on him to take his power that he had given to overcome with and use it on himself he didn't use it on himself he used it for others he used it on others not for himself it wasn't for him though he could have done it he certainly could have done it paragraph 116 if you can identify it in there towards the bottom there but we see how the devil gets the devil wants you to mind him he minded only what the father said do that's right he said why satan it is written he give the angels charge so jesus goes back to what the word not even his needs as a man in his power to meet it as a man he made it subject to the word next slide he said yes but it's also written there you are he knew who he was satan did the thought runs deeper than its rope its inspiration the kernel is on the inside of it what it really is this is so good though he could have done it he didn't do it he never paid heed to satan's proposition and this is i think where he's saying the colonel's on the inside come on our identity our true identity who we really are and he's looking at this this exchange between satan and christ and now he makes it very relevant to us now here is a good thing sometimes satan can take you and when you think you're doing the will of god and can make you a proposition you fall for it yes sure he sure can yes sir he sure can now let's just take for instance this is really good let's for instance like our sisters they are pretty amen and he can get you to a place that you let your hair grow out and you didn't realize it looks so nice on you and the first thing you know you kind of get feeling a little stuck up a little above someone else some of you men you know what i mean you guys you're wise you're really good can't can't provoke you into saying amen and getting a bruised rib and he can make that same thing and proposition it with you that's right you've got to overcome that he's talking about humility toward even what god is doing in your life it's not lifting you up saying god's first i'm second but there's something to where you you through the humility of christ your ambition your holiness is not an expression of how good you are you don't get a little stuck up because of god's blessings you see that god i know my position i know where he's placed me if he's placed me third i view myself as being some sort of foundational element some sort of servant beneath my family with god as the head that i can lift up from beneath to him i can serve from beneath to him god working from above me working from below heaven is his throne here i am is his footstool let me place my family in between us it's a family sandwich right and you and god are the bread the families the meat and you serve to hold it together you serve to to you you want to exist to serve it now this is just changing our attitude this humility you've got to overcome that just remember you're living for god you have one objective that's jesus christ outside of that there is nothing else he says there is nothing else and there's nothing else counts that's him so we have one objective christ then secondly for your family then thirdly for yourself but first for god and he repeats in case we just didn't get it right next for your family and next for you you are number three can we have someone make a foam finger it's this there's always the one i'm number one right but i mean i go hey hey have your name on it too right i'm number three i mean what the what is that i'm number three you say see at least you got the bronze at least you're on the stand says you're number three that's the end of the road put yourself last he did that's the masterpiece husband he put himself last first god next your family third yourself this is the order that god gives it now my main point is this is the word first family second now don't filter what family is don't put your filter on it don't scroll through and say family is husband and wife in a fully paid off house with a boy and a girl there and choose that filter family is is something that is related to an expression a relationship but it has to be it's it's something that only has context within the word of god you have you have the word in whatever family is to you whatever relationship it is to you whatever expression it has for you that has to be second now with that as the foundation i'd like you to look at our text i'm just gonna i wanna i'm gonna end with this story but travis i really needed that worksheet to be able to summarize this story a little bit better but he never emailed it to me but speaking of elijah it says he after these ravens had fed him at the brook sheriff and kind of very interesting ravens not being a clean bird according to to a jew here he is at this brook he's being fed by ravens but now the brook dries up the ravens aren't coming so god calls him and so it it he's commanded not to go start with verse 10 so he arose and went to zarephath and now as he comes to therefore remember the context this is a time of drought be in a time of drought where there is no rain it's a time of famine because they haven't been to grow grain so the most precious resources would be number one water and by virtue of no water there was not very much meal or grain or corn or anything to grow so water would be the most precious resource and he says he comes to the gate of the city and a widow woman was there gathering sticks so now he comes up and he's he's thinking oh man the first woman i come up to at the gate come to a woman and maybe he's inspired god told me that there would be a woman here and he sees her gathering sticks and if she's gathering sticks maybe she's maybe there's something she has some kind of resource she needs a fire and he called her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and his faith is kind of valued a little bit because she says immediately and she was going to fetch it and it speaks so much to her character this little woman her character was not water what you just asked for the most important thing i could get you a stick or two but you've asked for water this is very precious but there's something instinctive to where she doesn't object she goes to get the water and perhaps elijah's now being a little bit more encouraged so he says oh wait and also bring me a morsel of bread in my hand and then she says the lord liveth i don't have bread i don't have a cake all i have is a little bit of meal in a barrel a little bit of oil and she says i'm just going to get a couple sticks to make a fire then i may go back home and make a fire prepare the bread give it to my son that we both will eat and die so now elijah is thinking maybe not maybe this isn't the woman right we're just looking at it from a natural standpoint but notice how the story now at this very moment at this this part in verse 14 elijah now speaks fear not and go and do as thou has said go take care of your son go do what your instinct was as a mother but make me a cake first bring it to me first and then after you've made it for me make one for you and your son and if you do this this is the promise if you do that the barrel of mill shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the lord sin reigns upon the earth it says in verse 15 she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he elijah and her house her family or her household did eat many days and it says the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crucifer oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah there's an image that's being expressed here to me that's so beautiful because on one hand it's it's it's supporting what i'm wanting to leave in your minds today is that where the word must be placed first but i love how god has so beautifully arranged the scripture that here you have a what is called a widow this is a woman without a husband and even though she didn't have a husband she had a use and a utility within the framework of god's word to produce and bring forth the promise here is a woman a woman and her son and that's a family maybe unconventional may be different than our white picket fence and the way we have it all drawn up in our nuclear family right it's a little bit different than the conventional image but it's still a family and though maybe not in the image that we might think is desirable maybe not in the image that we say that the original masterpiece family was in but yet this is a woman that was under a divine commission and had a purpose because it said in verse nine arise and get thee deserve which belongs to zidane and dwell there behold i have commanded i have appointed i have purposed i have positioned a widow woman there to sustain me i have called a woman without a husband i've called a woman in a very difficult circumstance i've called a woman who is having to make a living for herself and for her children she doesn't have the resources that other families has she doesn't have the reputation that other families have but i have called her i've appointed her i've commissioned her i placed her she has a purpose and we will find purpose and fulfillment and serving him first not our families certainly not our own interest not our own agenda and not our own pain we'll find purpose in serving him first brother brahm said this about her she put god first excuse me she put god before her children musicians if you'd come she put god before her children she put god before anything else she taken the kingdom of god first god must have first place in your heart first place in your life first place in everything that you do or what you are god must be first i'm thankful for that because then i don't i'm not gonna i'm not gonna take who i am and place it under the headship of my past and i'm not going to take my mistakes and my my ramblings and my failures and i'm going to i'm going to wear them on a a jacket so to speak and say look i i lettered in frustration see this see see 97 to 2000 right there i let it in doubt and have a bunch of letters on my coat that describe what i was in the past but i want to make him what i am putting first place in everything what he says that you do or what you are god must be first he doesn't want the second place he doesn't deserve the second place he deserves the best and the first and all that we've got he deserves it this is what is expressed in christ as the mystery of god revealed christ must have preeminence and then as christ has premises he has the first place we can then grow into a true family that's the only there's no other way that it can happen and i love it too because i i mean maybe it might seem apparent and if there's if there's an elephant in the room let's just mention it we don't all have spouses do we we don't all have children still at home we don't all have children serving the lord none of us look back and have it perfectly and so it could be very foreboding and certain teachings can become so narrowed down to where it becomes so exclusive and say hey for the next few months those of you who aren't under 40 and have children under 13 you can stay home or go somewhere else and uh and and you can wait until i've raised teenagers before i'll teach on that no it doesn't become exclusive it doesn't become unapplicable it's applicable but the beautiful thing about putting the word first and letting christ have the preeminence and then you put god first family second you become last year third is this principle then of putting the word first in the beginning was the word and the family became second this principle becomes the great equalizer among us all it's what brings us all on the same footing christ is our objective my family hasn't become my objective christ has become my objective that's become my objective and so none of us begin to grow long hair and think we're prettier than anybody else christ has become my objective none of us begin to figure it out what works with our sons and none of it begin to figure out what works in our marriage and begin to feel better than anybody else no that's not what happens the more that christ begins to become first then the more we become third and then we never lift up any particular image of family as better than anybody else it makes somebody feel like they lack or that they don't feel like they belong the word becomes the great equalizer christ is our objective and in christ you're my brother you're my sister we're all one in this together regardless of family status regardless of the structure of a family regardless of the quality of the relationships we share in our natural life we share the same vision and look around you're my brother you're my brother you're my sister you're my sister we're family we we we have a we have a family that we serve we have an identity that is greater and then i love it if we have a word family then i have word resources at my disposal i've got word people who can pray for me in my natural family situation i've got word people that can minister to my needs in the natural i'm part of something greater i'm part of something more supernatural and that's where i derive my instructions that's where i get my identity as a son or daughter of god amen not as the son of david mcgeary senior that's not why i derive it put god first if we all do that then we don't place anybody else third [Music] it's a great equalizer let's stand [Music] [Music] such a beautiful presence here today [Music] the lesson is put him first put him first in all that you are your identity serve him several of the scriptures that i wanted to share there's stories in the bible where god is using very specific relationships and you have a woman of ill fame a prostitute who did what gave vent her inspiration and went forth to serve him she didn't let her past her relationships none of that changed it you talk about a messed up family the woman at the well bring me your husband she's bold enough so i don't have a husband no and maybe the guy at home was like what am i right the sixth one and he says yeah you're right you've had five and the one you're with now is not your husband that's kind of a messed up situation right we look down on people who just had one and now on number two this one this is a really bad situation for a teenager his brother brandon places her she's still used there's still a word for her there still was a position for her she went into the city said come see a man who's told me everything i've done and and we see this this great equalizer that in christ were one if through the humility of christ we could begin to put ourselves third and say lord i'll put you first family second i'm last and we take away from that we're not getting hung up on what number two is we're getting hung up on who's number one that's what's important who's number one and then if you could almost look at it in terms of a of an effort and what you're putting forth if you're third and family second and christ is number one then you're you want to serve christ and so this ambition to serve christ it's just going to run through who's number two my ambition to put it first is going to have some sort of influence and flow to who's number two we use a language perhaps to create some kind of hierarchy and order but listen at the end of the day it's about christ the word having preambs that's what we're lifting up that's what we want to achieve we have one objective that's christ that's what we're trying to achieve let's bow our heads a gracious heavenly father as we've crossed over midday and we're in the afternoon we've looked into the word and we've seen expressions that we gain instruction from that we see as actual stories things that literally happen which convey the supernatural of a prophet in a time of famine being told to go to a town a smelter town a place with a refinery to find a widow woman another gentile an unclean bird now a gentile woman and you had ordained a gentile woman and we see the supernatural because she received the prophet and takes him at his word she puts god first and in this story we see provision comes around the crucible oil never runs out the the barrel of meal never runs out and her and her family live all these days because she put you first because the word that came from the prophet according to the saying of elijah lord that literally happened but now father not only are we receiving a knowledge of a supernatural instance but we also receive instruction and even through the type that you had a calling for a woman without a husband you had a calling for a woman in a difficult situation you had a calling for a family dynamic that wasn't the perfect picture of what was even in the beginning and what we gather from that is regardless of what we are in the natural what we're called to do is to put you first and the natural will take care of itself perhaps lord i would say it another way we put the supernatural first and the supernatural just has a way of putting the natural in perspective father that would be my prayer as we've looked at these different principles in the word of god today and through these last several services and even introducing the subject of the family may we all be brought into union and fellowship on this thought christ is our objective the word is first and that we have experienced difficult situations wherein god has called us away from family moved us lord and and seemingly a separation from those that we love to place us in a position where you want us to be and sometimes we have to shake hands with our brothers sometimes we have to look our family in the eye and say god's calling me to do something else but we do it to take our position in you and i pray lord that as i may be influenced by personal a personal burden that i share and i may be very conscious of the different situations that we have within our church that vary from what we call the idealistic pattern lord i'm aware that we have husbands and wives of young age and raising families and that ways that becomes a burden to these men and these brothers and sisters lord i want i want to preach a positive gospel that encourages all of us i pray that we could always revisit this the word first we put you first we let you have preeminence that's that's our objective lord and i pray that today as we have lifted you up may we be drawn unto you may hearts be encouraged may we just anchor who we are in your promise anchor who we are in your provision and rest ourselves in your protection so we commit the people to you today lord we desire that your presence would be with us as we worship for a few moments in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen [Music] amen [Music] your spirit concert me lord and make me more like you and bless the broken pieces of my [Music] it's a beautiful song to ponder could we just ponder it for a moment let me just express this in the story of the widow of zaraphat that's all she was left with was pieces nothing was whole on that day she woke up as a mom who knew this would be her son's last meal now a lot of you may not be able to relate to that talk about desperation you talk about darkness and here's something she paints that she expresses a an action an activity and a faith that we can grab a hold of and we can use her example though she didn't have the image she didn't have the knowledge we have she didn't say oh elijah god's going to use your spirit five times and you're the first coming of elijah and she didn't have that she just had a commission she had a calling and her instinct was lord her instinct was you want water i'll get you water oh you want me to make you a cake well let me just let you know all i've got is broken pieces all i've got is a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil and all i have is a son i don't even have a husband we're just all broken pieces and he says just put me first and i can make pieces whole again just put me first oh you see this example in the ministry of elijah and elisha with the spirit of elijah is about making whole and and restoring and raising up from the dead can we have faith to believe today as those who've come under the the message of elijah in this hour that he is a redeemer he is a restorer if we put him first it says a hundredfold not even in this life but the life to come over there it'll all be made right and just then today say lord i'm looking at a lot of broken pieces but just let the fire come and through a melting and a breaking down you can take something that looks broken and bring it all back together again consider me lord with the fire of your spirit and make me more like you break me lord and bless the broken pieces of my life let me be lord by you sing it again lifting your heart to him
