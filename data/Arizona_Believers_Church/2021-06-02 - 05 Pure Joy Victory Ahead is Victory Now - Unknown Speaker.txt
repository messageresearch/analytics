TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's turn in our bibles to hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3. might have lost a little bit of my time today but um we know that we'll have opportunity to gather again and uh and pick up on these things if necessary if we need to cut it short hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 3 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith and that faith we know here is even a divine faith that we that we can possess and participate in not necessarily our own intellectual faith author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him this is the phrase we're very drawn to who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despise in the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god so he for the joy which was set before him despised the shame disregarded it brushed it off set it down and it sat down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds amen god bless you you could be seated this morning my title today and continue on the subject of pure joy is victory ahead is victory now and i originally god had dealt with my heart in just really in a very enthusiastic and excited about the prospect of victory and that where there's challenges and we're going through something and we're facing difficulty we ought to look at it as an opportunity to experience a deliverance to experience a victory and to see god come on the scene and do something tremendous so a challenge is an opportunity to experience victory a challenge is an opportunity to rejoice in overcoming and on the subject of pure joy this the pure joy is the joy of the lord that that's what it is when i talk about pure joy i'm not talking about a human emotion or an excitement as a human but i'm talking about the joy of the lord so it's not something that's solely characterized by human emotion or our human experiences but it's something divine that comes from god and pure joy is not the absence of uncomfortable emotions or the absence of negative emotions uh pure joy is not the immunity from sadness or not being able to feel pain but pure joy is the product of purpose that where there's a purpose you derive fulfillment you derive satisfaction from fulfilling the purpose and that gives us joy so our the joy of the lord is going to be found in submitting to surrendering to recognizing and accepting his purpose and the and the will the desire that he has for you and for your for your life and so as we can say it this way that if we're going to experience joy we don't want to pursue happiness or pursue things that make us happy or pursue things for the the sole purpose of being excited but we want to we want to pursue purpose and in pursuing god's purpose the product or the outcome of that is going to be his joy and if we're pursuing purpose that means we're not going to run away from pain and sometimes to fulfill purpose you got to experience things that are uncomfortable to pursue purpose and to fulfill the will of god in your life you have to face things that are difficult and and be challenged and suffer so as we're running towards our destiny that we're willing to face the pain we're willing to endure difficulty because we know it's worth it now the last two services we spoke on the subject of num and in looking at the subject of num it was meant to provoke uh the appropriate level of feeling for those who are losing it and and there's been many that have provided some feedback and expressed just how direct it was and i believe that was god dealing with you in a very special way that it's very easy for us for particular individuals through their life experiences church experiences relationships and business experiences a lot of different things that we can go through to where we experience emotional numbness we become numb to things and then there's a way that it turns into spiritual numbness because we become so unaffected by things because we're trying to protect our emotions and our hearts that god who wants to deal with us in our emotions and wants to give us the fruits of the spirit and wants us to enjoy certain things we're unable to enjoy the fullness of the christian life because of that numbness and and so i was dressing something very very specific but i want to read in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 the bible says for we walk by faith not by sight and it's a parenthetical phrase that paul inserts into the larger point that he's making but it's inserted by the translators in such a way that this statement could be taken outside of the context and it remains the same and so it adds some clarity to where it is in the chapter but we look at this it says for we walk by faith not by sight let's take sight to encompass all our emotions that we do not walk by physical emotion or physical sense we walk by faith brother brahma says we don't go by feelings we go by god's word and so though we were addressing emotional numbness and and how we can become very emotionally numb or even spiritual numb uh i want to say this faith is not being emotionally numb that we can become so emotionally i'm unaffected all this is real faith no you've just become numb so faith is not becoming numb or void of feeling or void of emotion faith has some sense to it faith has a sense faith with faith you experience joy you experience happiness you experience a life full of the fruits of the spirit and so we need to be balanced that in dealing with being numb the object wasn't to uh take us from being emotionless to just a bunch of wild fiery no and and become emotional creatures which is brother here and i'm just crying all the time or i'm just laughing all the time and just become i may be emotionally ecstatic so we're not pushing you to be emotional but we are dealing with a hardness of heart and a and a callousness and a disconnectedness or even an indifference that we can begin to experience through the things that we go through and provoke the appropriate level of feeling but let us be certain that what we do as christians is we walk by faith not by our emotions and be and and be conscious that god uses emotions and will deal with us in the realm of emotion so we need to be sensitive sensitive enough so that god is dealing with us properly and sensitive enough so that we can enjoy being christians there's not a better life to live than living the christian life now in hebrews chapter 12 we'll look at verse 2 it says looking unto jesus and now we're now we're taking a step further in this looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith so there's a process he's the beginner and he's the perfecter so it starts it goes through the process and it's perfected who now this is the one that we're looking unto who for the joy that was set before him this must have something to do with the perfecting of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god so jesus christ endured death and despised shame because of the joy that was set before him so it says look unto jesus now there's something about christ and his example that he wants us to ponder and to consider he was able to endure death and despise shame because of a joy set before him so think of it this way and these phrases i think will help us as we carry forward in this his present circumstances versus his future circumstance so in his present circumstances you can say that he was suffering as the next verse says such contradiction of sinners that's bitter hostility so he was experiencing bitter hostility he was experiencing shame and he experienced death so that was a that was a circumstance that he was enduring he was enduring the cross despising the shame suffering this bitter hostility that was what he was presently going through but his future circumstance the bible says is he's now set down at the right hand of the throne of god so the verse affords us the ability to look at a circumstance that jesus was in and while in that circumstance he was forward looking to a joy that was set before him and then it tells us that he's now sitting at the right hand of the throne of god so pondered that how that this is his future circumstance versus his present circumstances he could endure the bitter hostility he could endure the death he could disregard the shame and the humility of the manner of that shame the manner of the death the manner and the humility of dying that dying on the cross was the most horrible death that you could have it wasn't that he died in an accident it wasn't that he died of old age it wasn't even that he was murdered in his sleep but to be hung on a cross was a despicable shaming event that was meant to humiliate and jesus was able to endure such contradiction of sinners endured the death and even disregard the shame and the humiliation of the manner of the dead now he did not consider those things in themselves as a joy but he can look over those things to the joy beyond it so it wasn't this this attitude this you know sadist added to oh i just love being you know inflicted with pain isn't this awesome you know isn't this misery a wonderful it wasn't that he saw the cross as a joy it wasn't that he saw the humiliation as a joy it wasn't that he saw the suffering as a joy when the cataline tells was being whipped into his back and his flesh is being torn from his body it wasn't that jesus enjoyed that i don't think that any of you ever thought that he did but ponder this when we talk about being joyful it doesn't mean that you have to derive some pleasure from the pain or derive some pleasure from the fact that you reject oh i love it when people hate me oh i love it that when people beat me up and they inflict pain and i hope i go home today and they've stolen my laptop wouldn't that be awesome that's not the kind of attitude that we have we think well that person's got a mental disorder and so it wasn't that jesus enjoyed those things or regarded those things themselves as a joy but he looked over those things to a joy beyond it so now there's there's a there's something that happens when he does that so he's going through pain and suffering there's shame there's humiliation there's bitter contradiction this is really a death but as he looks beyond it to the joy that is set before him it it flips back reverts back to to this present situation and the future joy that he knows is going to be there takes away the power of the present pain the future joys he's looking forward to the joy and he knows there's a joy coming it has it has this ability for christ now to almost re radiate back to him and take the sting out of what he's going through it took the power away from the rejection it took a power away from the suffering so christ was upheld despite the terrible emotional and physical suffering that he was going through he was upheld despite everything that he was enduring because he held something in view during his torment so he was being tormented he was suffering he he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity so it wasn't that when jesus if we held a lighter to jesus's hand and begin to burn him he's like yeah that feels good i don't know what you're talking about i know what pain is he knew what pain was but in his torment he held something in view and with that in view he could rejoice presently in the purpose of his suffering he knew that what he was going through wasn't without purpose he knew that and this is where i i just feel i need to allude to this i wasn't planning on maybe breaking this part of the scripture down but jesus as he's suffering he knew that through his sacrifice it was going to bring many sons into glory so he could say it's all worth it every pain every agony even the rejection of his father he knew was going to bring many sons into glory paid the sacrifice for for mankind sin and actually avenge god's anger upon the elect that it would all be satisfied it would all be it would be justice and it would be play god's wrath towards us would be placated in himself so he knew it was going to accomplish something great and knowing that it provided him a solace it provided him a comfort it even provided him a joy in what he was suffering so the purpose of the suffering he knew look i'm not just being crucified and being made a political figure i heard a song one time it was written many years ago how that the crucifixion and i think maybe the language might be a little off-putting but the idea was that not not swear words or anything it's an incredible rap song no it was it was just a christian song that was written that the way in crucifying christ they didn't mean to but they made him a celebrity we may not use the celebrity but in crucify him they proved he was the messiah and so it was their their what they were doing he knew there was a purpose he wasn't just a puppet he just wasn't the fall guy he wasn't the scapegoat in that ah these things are just wait we found a guy to quell a rebellion and now everyone was respect us no they were accomplishing something very very great he knew his death was for a purpose and it helped him so as we're looking to jesus something about his future this is the part i just want you to catch because this is really my whole thought i'm just going to keep repeating myself for the remainder of the service there's something about his future change something about his present something about his future was enough to change what was happening presently so my my title is victory ahead is victory now if you believe if you believe that ultimately we're going to win let me ask show hands if you believe you're going to ultimately win then if you know for sure you're going to win then you are winning because you're you're not going to lose so even in sports if we knew the end and we knew the outcome and you know that in the end this team wins and you find out that at the beginning of the game they were down by so many runs or they had gotten behind by this this many points you could say well they're losing no they're not they're on their way to winning the score may be upside right upside down right now it may not look like they're winning but we know they are going to win so this is just a process in the result of winning come on sports fans or somebody if you know as the bride of jesus christ if you know that there's victory ahead and we just believe one day there's going to be victory one day there's going to be victory then it's victory now then no matter how bad it looks no matter how hard it is no matter how difficult things are then i believe we are winning why because we believe that we walk by faith not by sight second corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 for we walk by faith not by sight well let's just acknowledge this is not humanly rational if we went outside right now if we went to the park and we just started talking to people and we said oh well i just go by faith they'd be like you know they wouldn't really believe there's much value or merit in faith and so i understand that this statement really is the opposite of human instinct yeah put a blindfold on and try to get out of this room right and you realize that in this in the in a way that we rely so much on our senses for this scripture to say that we walk by faith not by sight we need to even stop being carnal even about the verse it's trying to tap us into something greater than physical sight now there's a statement and and i think it's something that is very very large a lot of different ways to approach it i'm sure you've heard the statement before perception is reality now i want us to ponder whether or not this is true and then if we if we feel that there is a truth to it we need to consider the true application or meaning of this phrase because to say that perception is reality perception is we we perceive by the input of our senses so if i closed my eyes then i could perceive that someone is singing or i if i if i if i use certain senses there's a perception that takes place so our senses send data to our brains and then our brains actually interpret the data and process it and you spit out an income an outcome they say well this is what it is data in and your brain says oh this looks like this this smells like that this is what it is and then we come to that conclusion so perception is the process of judging our senses our senses give us information our brain judges it and then we comprehend certain things to be so perception isn't necessarily an imagination but it's input and the brain judges the input and comes to a conclusion and in doing so there has to be a there has to be a contact that's made our senses have to be making contact with something and then our minds give it meaning does that does that make sense that there there's something have we have you perceived what i'm saying you know properly you hear something oh what did they say and it's it's i i guess there's a lot of things out there today it's amazing how the internet is made available to us a lot of uh a different phenomena to where you can hear a phrase and one person hears one thing another person hears another and then when they tell you what they heard you start hearing what they heard and they start hearing what you heard and then you can hear all there's certain phrases you can hear 10 different things is the dress blue or is it gold is it this or is it there's different ways and you want to what is it really just tell me what it really is but what is it that's perception and there's certain ways that our minds can be tricked into perceiving certain things and so it's our senses are going out and perceiving it so in perception it does not necessarily imply actual knowledge for there to be perception there isn't necessarily a realization of what it really is well what is really being said because it can be said in such a way to make you think it's something else and and maybe i'll still use the slide so if anybody comes back and when i use this slide you all know what it what it what's coming so you could just sit back and watch everyone else fall for it but there's a way that you can put a phrase up on the board cover half of it and ask everybody what does it say and everyone will say ice cream is good because that's exactly what you're thinking it says remove the cover from it it's just random letters but the mind actually fills in the bottom part of the letters based upon the top part that it sees and our mind is really really good at doing that filling in the blank spots and your periphery that's just how the mind works and so there's a way that we perceive things but it doesn't necessarily mean it's real so perception is based upon senses an odor or a flash of light a noise a bump you know something that's tactile or taste these are ways that we perceive things but this is what the phrase perception is reality is saying what we perceive to us is fact what we perceive to us is truth if you if you say something and i perceive you to say to to say it what i perceive you to say is to me what you said they say that's funny you just said you like spaghetti i didn't say i like spaghetti you know i don't like spaghetti no i heard you say it right and it's all based upon perception i don't well and so what you perceive to you as fact truth or israel and when somebody thinks something to perceive something it can become so stubborn that really there's no amount of evidence that can sway them from the contrary the one example i really love of this is there was two conspiracy theorists they were with and they were really deep into the conspiracy theory of who who killed john f kennedy and just so happens they both died at the same time and they went to heaven you realize i'm telling a joke now right and they went to heaven and this they lived their whole lives just enamored with the jfk conspiracy and they believed it you know they just knew as a conspiracy it was probably the cia joined with the mob and it was cuba and it was russia and they all you know it was something really really nefarious the secret service was in on it the cia was in on it the you know everyone there's a big huge conspiracy and so they they get to heaven and peter says you know what we always let one person always let people ask one question before they enter in that they've always wanted to answer it and they both looked at each and said wow awesome this is that this is their chance so we want to know who killed john f kennedy both of us that's the one question we want to know and so they won't peter goes away he's going to go ask god and they were just so excited about what was going to happen they just knew this was going to be their chance to to find out the truth and peter comes back and says i've asked god who it was and god said that it was one shooter it was oswald he did it and he acted alone and the conspiracy theorist went this is way bigger than we thought did you get it there's not god's in on the conspiracy because what they perceived became so stubborn in their head it was their reality they weren't willing to consider any other reality and that's how perception becomes reality but it's misleading because perception only defines your reality not how things really are in fact perception does not change reality but this is where it's important to understand remember my my subject is victory head is victory now so we're dealing with our perception perception does not change reality but it influences our thinking and behavior within it so if if you if it really in this room right now you perceived it to be very hot then you might start fanning yourself and and trying to cool off a little bit because that's how you perceive it but if in reality it was frigid your your perception doesn't change the fact that maybe it's 67 degrees and you might think that is hot i don't know uh i i sometimes what the other day i guess jack woke up and said he thought it was christmas that's how cold it was i woke up and thought it was christmas but perception then though it does not change reality it can influence your behavior within the reality and that way many times sometimes people's behavior does not conform with what your perception of reality is why is everybody running away or why is it you remain calm why everyone else around you is losing their heads it has to do with perception therefore our perception of our circumstances dictates our condition within them so what we perceive about what we perceive about reality is going to determine whether or not we panic or determine whether or not we do this or whether or not we do that so it's our perception we can't say that perception is meaningless that well perception is reality that's not true reality's reality and what reality is that's what matters yes but for the individual how they're going to react and interact within reality their perception means a lot now with that said let me just kind of throw a little quick glance at this in the day and age that we're living in synthetic reality is the thing simulated reality is a thing virtual reality is a thing and we are more and more coming into a time when people can live almost the entirety of their social lives or the entirety of their lives caught up in a simulated reality with the filters that are available people can present themselves in a with a particular persona that they look a particular way that they have a particular lifestyle that they're rich or that they're extravagantly beautiful or that they're vacationing in a different place every week and they can actually begin to create a synthetic reality or a simulated reality or you can actually put on a headset and live in a virtual reality and you can immerse yourself in in games and and realities and role-playing and all these different things where people now are living in a simulated synthetic reality and that's that's the kind of life that we're living anymore where people would rather enjoy something simulated synthetic or virtual instead of just enjoy life and so that's that i just want you to think about that now in first john chapter 3 verse 16. i like i like the symmetry with john 3 16. but first john 3 16 because john 3 16 for god so loved the world and now first john 3 16 hereby perceive we the love of god this is how we perceive his love this is how we know his love because he laid down his life for us and he says and he's dealing with brother love and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren now when john uses the word perceive because when we say perception is reality i i've cast a little bit of aspersion on i realize maybe i've clouded it a little bit that maybe perception is bad if your perception is wrong then it's not reality and with the wrong perception you can act incorrectly within the reality then but if your perception's right then it ought to cause you to act correctly within the reality now so it's not it's not let's just become dull and not perceive at all we just want to have the right kind of discernment sensitivity but i want to make this point when john uses the word perceived it's not me speaking uh merely of perception or knowing facts it's something deeper to the the guinosko is the word that's used here and the word knowledge or gonosco that with this this word is used to a greek when they would use the word knowledge they would just be referring to facts but the knowledge of those facts didn't necessarily have to move one person's behavior a person's behavior one way or another so to to a greek or to a gentile you may know something but it would not necessarily affect your conduct so knowledge in that sense was inconsequential but to a jew if a jew uses the word knowledge as john here is saying hereby perceive we hereby we know knowledge we have this knowledge of the love of god to a jew true knowledge always manifested itself in conduct that if someone actually and truly knew something it had a practical outworking in their life so to a greek maybe some you could say that yeah i know the house is on fire and you can literally stay in a house on fire yeah i know this ship is sinking yeah i know our days are numbered yeah i know this isn't going to last very long but who cares a greek could do that but to a jew they would say no you don't really know buddy you don't really perceive you don't really have a have a grasp because if you really knew the house is on fire you would get out of there so when john says hereby perceive we the love of god if he's using in a way that is deeper than just maybe the knowledge of a fact so let me say it this way if we truly know as he says hereby perceive you the love of god because he laid down his life for us if we truly know he died for us while we were yet sinners and i took a whole page of my notes out but i still want to just kind of throw this out there think about this that he died for us and we look that's looking backwards he died for us those of us who were yet coming so he died then for people who were not even here so you who were coming influenced what was happening then and go all the way back and i want to substantiate this by scripture go all the way back when was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world why was it slain because something that was coming think about it that your your sins then provoke the need and the intent of god before there was ever a speck of stardust to slay the lamb you don't think your future should do something he said if we know that he died for us while we were yet sinners therein that is where the knowledge of his love lies that if we know that then we know his love and it ought to provoke and produce a an absolute standing it should produce a state of confidence it should give us a north star where we can always get our bearings straight we can always orient ourselves regardless of the current circumstances regardless of the situation that we're in there's something that we could point to and be tethered to and say i know that he loves me well how do you know that he loves me he sent his son to die for me now that may seem to be real shallow christianity brother aaron don't you know the seals are open what does the open of the seals vindicate it's the second part of redemption what was the first part that sacrifice you can't rub that sacrifice out and do away with it and think that we can just you know hit parade about the seals being opened they they mean nothing without the cross they mean nothing without calvary they mean nothing without salvation they're connected together you cannot divide them and so we still have a north star that we're connected to since i am connected with calvary that my name is made known in the open of that book if i don't have a connection to calvary the opening of the book means nothing to me so we have an absolute standing now i'm going to read uh two lengthy statements to you and this is this is part of the whole burden that i've been looking at in this subject of pure joy and i'd like to take time in looking at different parts of these statements brother banham says this and i hope i'm just able to kind of read through it and not get hung up too much how can god how can god be just in love and if he stands by and watches his people suffer okay fair question someone may wrestle with that may try to figure that out he began he reads the scripture malachi chapter one verses one to three that i wanted to come to this part this is the proposition how can he be just and love him if we suffer you see they could not figure out god's love trying to perceive it trying to make sense of it they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care they thought that if god loved them he would not let him suffer they thought that if god loved them then as a parent would want to baby and nurture and cuddle a newborn that's what the love of god would be always but god said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened think about this his love was proven truly by the fact that that they were chosen under salvation because god had chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth and that's quote in scripture then he says so we're chosen as salvation he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with the purpose this is this is where the perception of god's love gets unwound is i'm suffering but if it's disconnected with purpose then all you're going to get is suffering because it's just pain for the purpose of pain it's just suffering for the outcome of suffering it's tribulation a trial of torment for the sake of torment but brother i'm saying but he does it all with the purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace but jesus is the author and finisher of our faith and so our suffering and what we endure and what we go through has something to do with either the beginning of our faith the perfecting of our faith and the finishing of our faith everything that we go through god stands there as the great guide and shepherd and he's making movements and doing things to see that we get where we need to go and god's not one to over correct and end up in a ditch he knows just how to gently guide he knows just how to navigate he knows just what to do he's a kind shepherd it's a tender hand of jehovah he knows when he has to really put the pressure on he knows when he needs to ease up god knows what he's doing and so if you're committed to something and you're going through something and you're experiencing distressing emotions you're experiencing rejection you're experiencing physical pain we can believe and we must be certain of and know that number one he loves us and that what i'm going through is not god telling me he doesn't love me and the reason why we feel that way is because we think that god's love is like the love we've experienced from humans but let me say you do god a tremendous disservice if you think he loves like man he's not vindictive he's not emotionally abusive and manipulative i think so many of us have experienced narcissistic love in our lives and we just expect god to be that way that god is the great narcissist oh he's gonna he's gonna gaslight me now oh he's gonna give me he's gonna he's gonna give me the cold shoulder and he's gonna do this and he's gonna do that no do not attribute human emotion to god so i am confident then when i'm suffering he loves me number two that in the suffering he has a purpose so i have no further distress questioning his love for me and now just as jesus who for the joy was set before him was able to endure affliction because it had a purpose now it changes my perception of what i'm going through i'm still perceiving pain but i started saying no pain no gain right this is the stage that i'm in right now this is what i'm going through this is what's happening but all my even though i'm going through it i can look beyond it for the gains that are coming i can look beyond it for the joy that has come i can look beyond it knowing that there's a purpose in this because if we didn't have that all that it would produce is frustration and peace not and a lack of peace so then he makes this statement and this is a little bit later in the same chapter the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval now let me just say this to many of us we have perceived these words all right i take it back i'm sorry our neighbors in the apartment next door and me just me today just pray for it brother aaron the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval okay neither the bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is in the beloved he love his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world okay this is something we have to be certain of he says does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so he's the only parent that really can just continue to get away with that i said so i believe it i believe it i believe it and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself gave us a spirit placing us his son so it was made manifest in that he sent us unto die for us we're experiencing his love through the new birth and he says and how shall i prove my love to him now why did he have to go and ask that question i felt really good in knowing that the cloudy skies and storms of life are not a vindication that he hates me or doesn't isn't proof that he doesn't love me and i took some comfort in knowing that i just don't have to have bright skies and still waters as a sign of his love and approval that was wonderful knowing his love for me and just working on that part and accepting that was great but now how do i prove his love to him my love to him by believing what he said all right okay we're good should we just sing take the name of jesus with with us i mean should we stop there because this is the part that hurts and by conducting myself with joy admits the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass so sorry lord i feel like i've been an eeyore most of my christian life just everything is always so bad by conducting myself now how is my love this goes back to how i've perceived this love now if i'm fully confident in it if i'm if if it's growing if the depth of it's growing i believe what he said all right now i have a responsibility here's here's here's the proof that i know his love and and that as as i know that he loves me i love him because we love him because he first loved us so there's a connection here i have to conduct myself with joy admits the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass that's a lot there right there's a whole lot there now what i've learned in my life is that you never have to sit back and try to figure out if this trial is the one that he's allowed in his wisdom well how do i know this is the one he allowed in his wisdom to come to pass if it's happening he's allowed it so every trial is a trial that he and his wisdom has allowed to come to pass so don't let that verbage kind of qualify towards like well i'm just trying to figure out if this is his wisdom or not no if he's allowed it it's his wisdom that allowed it if you're going through it if you're suffering if you're sick if you've lost something if you're experiencing pain or distressing emotions somehow god for some reason has let the devil do that he has let you do that he has let things take place and happen i lost this this happened i've suffered this i've gone through this treatment i've gone through that all these different things god in his wisdom said i'm going to allow this to come to pass so we do not need to engage in this exercise of trying to figure out whether or not this is a trial i need to conduct myself with joy in every trial in his wisdom he's allowed to come to pass therefore in every trial i must conduct myself with joy but how in the world can i do that how is that even possible and there just seems to be some people that just wake up in the morning like oh is this great i love recessions you know it's an opportunity you know like every day is just by the dip to them right you know they're never catching falling knives it's just always hey you know this great this wonderful pandemic that just means time to garden and ever they're always just happy and oh well when one door closes there's always another one that opens and you know i'm pretty handy i can always put a window here and get out they're just that's just the way they are right they just live that way and then it seems like most of us were easily affected by negative things and bad things that are happening and pandemics and sickness and sorrow and we just we don't find ourselves in every situation like well isn't that wonderful i heard a story one time of this sister i think she was in flagstaff who never had a negative thing to say so they wanted to kind of trip her up one time and she said well what do you think about the devil she said oh he's a perfect adversary so let's let's focus on what he's saying here then my conduct admits the trials that he allows to come to pass ought to be one of joy therefore my joy is not the product of my current circumstances but it is a condition that is born from my future if if think of it and i'm just wanting to unpack what brother brown is trying to say here it's not that we look at what we're going through and derive this you know handwriting pleasure from licking the chops like all this is so great i can't wait till they come up with covet 21. that's not what we do and anticipate calamity and destruction and catastrophe and like that kind of chaos we just know that right now though things are chaotic and things are uncertain i'm looking beyond it to something that i know is certain there and there's something about that reality that can produce a joy in the midst of my current situation so my joy conducting myself with joy acknowledges that i'm in the midst of a trial but recognizes that since he's allowed it to come to pass he must have a purpose and then that purpose being forward looking and that purpose being in the future it bursts that purpose now burst forth into my present state and i can have joy knowing that there's a purpose in this look at this in the scripture in luke chapter 9 verse 62 says jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom so we ought not to live our lives looking back on our past mistakes and our regrets and and if a man is always looking at the road behind him he's going to deviate his course going forward he's like man why is this row so crooked i can't figure out why because he's not looking ahead he's always looking at it but if he could just put his eyes on that row and stay at a fixed point on the horizon he could go in a straight line so this this introduces this thought of how that labor is conducted with the future in view anybody here have a job anybody here not getting paid for that job that's called volunteer work uh and are you getting school are you getting credit for that you know it's got to be some payoff right if you're not getting paid for your labor that's slavery that's bondage that's servitude there's there's no joy in that there's no if i'm just going out and and working for somebody and there's nothing in return then that i don't derive any benefit from that so the labor always looks forward not behind that's that's why sometimes contracts are structured the way that they are if you get paid up front then you got the payments in the past it's really hard to do the work knowing that there's not a payment coming you say well i gave you 10 grand to do the job why don't you do the job yeah but there's not 10 grand coming now and that's why they structure contracts the way they do it's to provide the incentive for the person to finish the job why because we be humans and we need that and so as jesus is using this image of a farmer the sower has the harvest before him as he labors in the winter in the spring and the summer so think of all these weeks and months all these days of difficult labor it begins even in the winter it continues into the spring and then through the hottest times of the year in the summer there's this tremendous labor and exerting and effort that's put into it and at the time there doesn't seem to be anything you're getting back all the labor that goes into disking up the field and removing the rocks and turning over the soil and doing this and doing that and then planting the crops and then watering them and making sure there's irrigation and making sure they're treated right and every day this great care and this effort and every day there's no immediate benefit of return but what does the farmer do he envisions the harvest and the harvest in view is what helps him plant and work in labor every day so the reality of the future changes his condition in his current circumstances the reality that there is a harvest the fact that there is going to be a harvest colors the days of the spring and gives those days meaning the reality of the harvest paints the days of the summer and gives you a determination and a purpose in working in the summer if there was no harvest then what's the real purpose of getting up that early what's the real meaning of doing this and doing that there has to be a meaning to it so it's the end result why labor why toil why fight why struggle because of the reward of the harvest and paul says in first corinthians 9 10 he that ploweth should plow in hope i'm liking this to how we live in the midst of trials that we're going through we should go through them in hope he that thresheth in hope should be a partaker of his hopes so this is in using this image of a farmer one who labors should envision the harvest so that you are plowing in hope he who's threshing the grain thrashes in hope that he might be a partaker of the end result therefore if you plow in hope and you thresh in hope then you will not be sorrowful and you will not be sad or grieving in your labor but you'll know there's a payday coming there's a day coming there's a reward coming because the hope here is not this negative enemy of faith hope means faith it's actually translated to faith in one place it's expectation of good the word hope here means joyful confident expectation so if you're plowing in hope it serves as a motivator if you're thrashing in hope it serves as a sustainer hope actually at the time has an energy you're not actually eating the corn you're not actually eating the grain you're not in the in the moment benefiting from the harvest but you're actually getting an early return on it because the fact that it's going to be encourages you now oh no i'm in a plant i'm going to sow i'm going to work i'm going to labor how can you do that there's a reward coming you don't see the light at the end of the tunnel you don't see the payoff coming and that the the fact that there's something coming takes the sting of the labor away from it and that's exactly what is meant when who for the joy that was set before him it says the hope of christ was his source of joy and that is why we must look to him that is why we ought to consider him because here's christ enduring the shameful humiliation of a crucifixion enduring the bitter hostility of sinners and he for the joy who is which was set before was able to look past that and know in his present state that he was comforted by god's purpose and he could face it bravely didn't run from it the bible says in first corinthians chapter nine you feel me all right because this is this is fantastic stuff i well i think that that word kind of suggests maybe a fantasy it's wonderful stuff first corinthians chapter 2 verses 9 to 10. i i'd like to go quicker now but as it is you said quicker how can you do that but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of men the things that god had prepared for them that love him we cannot use our finite minds we cannot use our natural senses to imagine eternity we cannot use the senses of our spirit and the senses of our flesh to grasp eternal things right this is what the scripture is saying eye hasn't seen ear hasn't heard neither has it entered our imaginations our thoughts the things which now god hath prepared for them that love him so preparation future forward looking for them that love him so i'm going to conduct how do i prove my love for him i conduct myself with joy it missed the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass so now i cannot see nor ear hear neither can i imagine the things which god had prepared for them that love him so it's almost as if in one statement god has built up this wall to where we are just left knowing well there must be something he's prepared for me but i don't know what it is but it's only saying you don't know what it is by human effort or human endowment in verse 10 but god hath revealed them to us unto us by his spirit this is the part that you all you always have to read verse 10 if you're going to read verse 9. it says but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit so of all the understanding of eternal life cannot be gained solely through the natural things around us and the things of natural life god still yet wants us to know them so he reveals them to us he reveals them to us by his spirit and the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god so god if you love god he's prepared something for you so though you may be here presently in something there is a preparation in the future and god does not want that preparation to be a total mystery so he reveals it to you now consider this why would he reveal it to you so though we do not understand eternal life to the things that we're going through or through natural life but rather the things that he has prepared or the things that lay before us help us to understand why things are the way they are here we cannot understand eternity through this life but by understanding eternity we can understand this life let me try to say it just another way we're not going to be able to understand eternity better by what we're going through here but as you understand eternity better you can better understand what you're going through here though it's future though it's something just seems to be beyond the things that will be help us to understand why things are the way they are why does he reveal to us the things that are prepared so that the future changes our present so that you conduct you can conduct yourself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass how is he going to do it not from your past but from your future so he that plows plows in hope he that threshes does so in hope there's joy now because there's joy ahead if i know there's a land coming where this joy shall never end if there's joy ahead there's joy now it says in hebrews chapter 11 verses 13 to 16 talking about the heroes of faith these all died in the faith having not received the promises i i need to i just want to okay i want you to catch what he says but having seen them afar off think about everything they went through having not taken possession but seeing them afar off were persuaded them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country it was something still coming but notice what it did it pulled them through all sorts of tragedies they even died in the faith and death was not evidence of a lack of faith they died in the faith even now for a believer we look past on on tragedies and we look at how we've lost loved ones to terrible things whether it be suicides or accidents and we look back and we wrestle with it and we can we can grieve over it and try to haunt us but they there's people who die in the faith but god does it all with a purpose people who declare these things are plainly seeking another country he says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out if they were thinking about it and that's what they were looking for and that's what they cared about the country they left they might have had an opportunity to just go back but they weren't backwards looking they weren't they weren't mindful of what they left they looked to something where they were going to even everything that you lose here you've already won there because god restores a hundredfold in this life and the life to come so whatever i lose here i know i got more coming i can't wait to the the brush i need in heaven all right i ain't lost to one of them but there's something you may lose it here but you're looking forward to it there you know that whatever i've lost here i've already won there so though they left family they left homes they left this they knew everything that they lost they knew they were going to a land where there was family there was homes there was lands there was an inheritance and so they didn't look backwards and it says that but now they desire a better country that is a heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he have prepared for them a city so they left one city looking for another city and even if they never found it they weren't wrong because god had prepared it and it was that kind of vision it was that kind of desire is that kind of looking forward that gave them the determination and the sustaining power they labored in hope to see what god had prepared so let me say this the reality of our eternity ought to impose itself on our present the reality of where we're going the reality of what we're called to the reality of what we will be the reality that we are going to be in perfectly healthy bodies the reality that we'll be in perfectly sound minds the reality that we will have a perfect and pure joy that reality ought to impress itself upon this reality and what is to be ought to change what is now it should impact how we feel impact how we act and interact with the things that are present brother branham says in things that are to be he says last night speaking over in yuma for the christian businessmen i spoke on the subject of the rapture now that might have been a strange subject to speak among at a banquet but most everyone there was christians and that's the way it is on these campaigns like this or in a church i can say now how many of you as christians probably every hand would go up you're a christian and so if we're christians i think we ought to be kindly notified ahead i think this is the reason why he preaches the rapture i'm so thankful for that message the rapture i think we should be notified ahead of time we don't have to just guess at it we are notified what our destination will be this so we're christians so he preaches the rapture everyone there was christians so i felt that christians should know what's happening and they should be notified what is happening and he says so we're notified what our destination will be and i want to speak on that tonight and the subject is going to be things that are to be now why would we need to know this is i just want you to catch this because i'm going to try to wrap this up sooner and i'm going to skip over a number of different things and we'll get to it another another time why would he preach things that are to be to people who are going through things now he says and now speaking last night on the rapture so tonight i want to speak on this subject things that would be that i might tie it together with last night's message now there's going to be a rapture we know that that's in the future to be so the the things that pertain there's things that are part of this rapture that's going to be so he's saying that i want to tie this in so things that are to be is a continuation of him preaching on the rapture because there's no question when he preaches the rapture what is the shout he identifies it there's things transpiring there's still things yet that are going to happen but we still need to know what will be why because what will be is what changes what is so god informs us beforehand and we ought to be notified beforehand what our destination will be he's tying this together the rapture seeing that this rapture is how he taught it he preaches things are to be why because things that would be have something to do with this rapture it's related it's connected and he uses this phrase that we ought to be notified beforehand what our destination will be like and in doing so the future impacts us presently try this with your your kids tell them someday this week get up we're going to the doctor you're getting vaccinated vaccine shots find out how quick they get out of bed right or just say come on get get up let's go we're leaving [Music] but tell them hey we're going to chick-fil-a you know then they're with their cow suits on er let's get this thing going because they know where they're going and all of a sudden it doesn't matter that it's so early so what happens think about this the destination determines their present conduct why he preaches the rapture then he preaches things that are to be because the revelation will cause the proper manner of preparation produces the proper expectation the proper enthusiasm the proper hope let me use this as an example if you're going to go on a trip you don't pay you don't pack based upon the weather where you are you pack based upon the weather where you're going and and that's why you could be and maybe brother loyal can testify to this you're up there in minnesota in the middle of the winter and you're at the airport and you see somebody in sandals and linen pants and a hawaiian shirt and you're like man we just got out of negative you know 32 below temperature and it's like you know exactly where this guy's going he's headed south not his life you know you know it's like an allegory of destruction coming oh he's he's wanting to go south for the winter he's going to go into hawaii people dress based upon where they're going people act based upon where they're going you see somebody who's all you know wearing all orange and their hands are behind their back and they're wearing these funny looking slippers why they're going to jail hey they dress and act where they're going but then you find somebody else who's dressed all you know restful and relaxed and they got their linen pants on and a hawaiian shirt and a a you know a nice hat and sunglasses they're prepared and ready for where they're going so you pack and prepare based upon not your point of departure the way things are but based upon what will be you prepare not for the way things are but for the way things are going to be why do you live that way the way things are going to be why do you act that way the way things are going to be why are you happy the way things are going to be i'm not going to live under the cloud of a pandemic i'm not going to live under a cloud of a recession i'm not going to live under a cloud of difficult things why things are going to be better that's what i'm living under and when someone's going on a vacation they get all excited i need to look and say hey man joe oh you're pretty happy today you're really throwing those boxes around man are you just you're just happy it's friday nope i'm going on vacation next week let's get this job done uh-huh it changes the way they work it changes the way they labor wow just what's coming what's next how much more are we to be as christians that if there's an excitement and there's an anticipation that overwhelms a person who's under positive expectation when they're going on a vacation then how much more should it be for people who are going to take a translation how much more should the things that are to be changed the way that things are now he says in john chapter 14 verses 1 to 3 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me that's the first part of proving our love to him but his subject is don't let your hearts be troubled in my father's house or many mansions this was his message to comfort a troubled heart oh don't worry you're not going to go through anything that's not what he said oh don't worry i mean they won't really agree with you but theologically you'll find some basis of fellowship and you'll all get along oh no they'll think it's wonderful that you're starting a church oh no no they'll they're right they'll be right there with you brother they're going to be they're going to support you they're going to lift you up they're gonna encourage you after all we're bride right you know he says he he doesn't tell him lies he says let not your heart be troubled in my father's house are many mansions no matter what you're going through here remember there's something there you're living for something that's next in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i'll come again and receive you unto myself now this phrase means something different to me right now for where i am there you may be also all sudden i didn't look at his future anymore i'm telling you now that i've gone to prepare a place for you and i've told you that now so that you wouldn't have i told you that that will be so that you wouldn't have troubled hearts now and that if you know that that's coming then no matter where you are you can be where i am if you can believe that's coming then you can have me where you are if you can say what a day that will be then what it changes the day that is if you're fully convinced that there's coming a day and what a day that will be and one day i'll see my savior face to face and you know that that's going to happen then shoulders that are slumped down and backs that are aching and hands that are becoming weak all of a sudden straighten up and say yes sir that's right one day i'm gonna see my savior face to face things that will be are supposed to change the way things are our future changes our present i think we're way too quick to reach into our past to define who we are given an opportunity right now we're going to let you go into a room and we want i want you to paint the picture of who you are tell me who you are i'm going to give you building blocks and you choose who you are you know what we'll do we'll go to the bin of our past and pull out all the blocks from our past to try to make sense of who we are we'll take the paint brushes and the canvas and all the paint from our past and that's what we want to paint the picture of who we are and you're using the wrong tools we shouldn't reach into our past to define who we are we should reach into the future reach into the future to grab the resources reach into the future to grab the building blocks reach into the future i'm going to use that paint i'm going to use those blocks i'm going to use those materials that past isn't who i am i was winning then though it made it look like i was losing but that's who i really am and that's what i'm going to use to paint this picture why not use faith why not use revelation to paint a different picture than even what you see now take the take the building blocks and the materials of the future and build a different present we can if we're convinced of it if you know it's there and you know you've invested in it it's an investment that pays daily dividends it's the best dividend stock you can buy every day multiple times a day you're getting a dividend of it from eternity we should begin to draw from them now we can get a return our investment now it says in first corinthians chapter 15 verses 54 to 58 what's what's so beautiful in this i've skipped a number of different things there's just so much more to look at this and this to see this just a few more scriptures first corinthians chapter 15 verses 54 to 58 this is how that once again we could see a scriptural example of how that things that are going to be changed the way things are so when this corrupts shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that is death is swallowed up in victory so paul looks forward to that moment that when everything when we are changed completely because there's going to be a translation of this flesh he's saying then it's going to be brought to pass then it'll be finally satisfied that death is swelled up in victory but notice paul's next statement he doesn't say just wait one day you're going to get what's coming to you no he actually says oh death where's your sting now oh grave where is your victory now oh oh but i thought that it's going to be death is going to be swamp and victory then okay but victory ahead is victory now if it's going to be defeated then it's defeated now if it's going to be overthrown then it has no power now this is exactly what paul says he's not saying oh one day you'll lose your sting one day you'll lose your victory it's gone now because he says the sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god who will give us the victory one day further down the road we're not sure when could be thousands of years through jesus christ that could be in the hiv bible but it's not in this one which give us us the victory through our lord jesus christ which who has given us it has been given yes one day everything will be fully summed up and it will happen that death is swallowed up completely in victory but that doesn't mean we don't have victory now because he has already given us the victory through jesus christ he says therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abound in the work of lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord in light of the fact that the victory ahead is victory now that it doesn't matter what may be here things that are to be changed things you can stand fast unmovable always abounded and fruitful in the work of the lord why because you know there's a reward coming you know your labor is not in vain do we believe that all things work together for the good do we really believe that then only things that can work for good can be if all things work together for the good then only things that can work for good can be there can be nothing in your life that can't be worked worked for good so don't worry don't fret don't be fearful tell eeyore goodbye i don't know if we need to be tigger or poo or what we would need to be in this scenario but we don't need to be or we don't need to be sad we don't be downtron oh woe is me i'm sad everything's horrible everything's miserable we can say you know what if it is then it will be good if it is then it will be good no matter what it is something's going to work with it i don't understand something's going to work with it so because whatever is can become good it's going to be worked somehow it has the potential for it has the promise of it things that will be change things brother branham says and things that are to be he says a real child of god is hungering and thirsting why if there's something in your heart telling you you want it and it needs there it shows there's something pulsating trying to pull you there there's a body there that this one is a type of here he says what are you using this one for to glorify the devil in the world and the fashions and things are you looking towards heaven there's something up there you're glorifying god with your life things that will be or changing things now because i'm not reflecting the world i'm not reflecting the devil i'm not reflecting a different destination i begin to reflect my destination and he quotes in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so i would have told you and i'll go and prepare a place for you and come again to receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also things that are to be these things that are now are only potential calling for the things that is to be that creates this connection this is what i want to close on it the the brothers could come that if there is that we have the promise of things future that there we have a we should have a conviction and a confidence that he has made us assurances and that he will keep his promises there is a rapture there is going to be a translation there is a land beyond the river there is a body i've gone to repair prepare a place for you in my father's house are many mansions that is a new body if this wasn't so i would have told you that you don't have a place to go through paul even teaches it that if we didn't have something in the in the afterlife i'm trying to stay away from the rest of my notes that are here but if if we didn't have the promise of something after this he says we of all people would be the most miserable so let's invert if we didn't have that promise we would be the most miserable but since we do have that promise we should be the mostest happiest because we have that promise if we didn't we'd be the most visible but because we do we're the most happy why because of the promise because of the purpose because of the future things that will be changed the way that things are if a simulated reality a synthetic reality and a virtuality is changing the way that human minds think and interact and the reality that people live within then something that i know that is beyond real beyond real beyond real and more real than this world i'm living in now then let that open up let it radiate let it shine down and let it change the way i live in the way i act now and may i be convinced according to first corinthians 15 that victory ahead is victory now victory ahead is victory now victory ahead is victory now joy ahead is joy now that are to be are calling to the potential of things now did you catch that things that are to be there's a call because the potential in things that are now in first peter chapter 1 verse 8 speaking of jesus christ it says and having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not yet believing so though we have not met him in the air though we have not seen him after his flesh though we have not seen him we love him though we have not seen him we believe him we beloved him halloween love him because he because we believe his word how do we prove our love to him we've proven it because we believe his word so having not seen him we believe him that means we love him whom having not seen you love though you have not seen him you're believing you loved him it's proven by the fact that you believe him and he says ye rejoice though you have not seen them ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory how could you have joy unspeakable and full of glory if you if if you did not have a revelation of him oh if i'm being kind of clumsy in how i deliver this listen you love him even though you don't see him and even though you have not seen him you still believe him and loving him and believing him you can conduct yourself with joy unspeakable and full of glory because he's revealed himself to you he has made himself known to you and that is your joy that is the impetus of praise that is the origin of our worship that is what i can say that in this there is good because i love him i believe his promises towards me and we are not waiting one day for joy unspeakable and full of glory it is here now it is yours you can take it you can have it because victory ahead is victory now ye rejoice now with joy unspeakable you rejoice now full of glory oh one day one day oh one day you know when the saints go marching in one day oh what a day that'll be one day i'm gonna get my praise on one day i'm gonna worship one day i'm gonna have joy unspeakable and full of glory one day one day well the alarm just went off today's one day today's that day the one day came we've been waiting for that day it's here let me just declare it's here we believe it we accept it we embrace it this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice and be glad in it my joy begins now my praise begins now my worship begins now i'm not going to hold it off put it off and put it out my my my life begins now my joy unspeakable and full of glory is mine now live in it walk in it and enjoy it god bless you stand to rejoice of rejoicing feet happy hands thanking god and praising him praise the lord let's offer some praise to him and some gratitude to him we pray we often we always try to pray to close the service and seal the things that have been ministered but let's just offer praise and thanksgiving together and and a prayer of praise and an offering however you would do it in your hearts joy unspeakable full of glory i'm challenging you today to not reach into your past to define who you are and to let you know that you have liberty to reach into your future to make who you are today we live under the bondage of our past don't get comfortable with that feeling don't become numb to the instinct to try to define yourself by your past go ahead and reach forward into the future and say i am what he's made me to be i am now what i'm going to be this is my promise this is my inheritance this is my destiny [Music] you know when brother branham tells a story about that that slave conducted himself differently than all the others it was not just the fact of where he came from that caused him to act differently [Music] but it was the fact that he was the heir to the throne so it wasn't just his past that changed his conduct but it was his future that changed his conduct he lived as one who believed he still had a right to that throne he lived as one who believed he was an heir to that throne he lived his royalty not as one who had it taken away from but as one that was coming back to it it doesn't matter what the devil seems to have taken away from you what you've lost what you've experienced what you've gone through what's been destroyed you serve a god that is a restorer that is a redeemer and i will not be defined by my past hurts by my past pains by my past estrangement by my past broken relationships but i will look forward to a god who is a redeemer who is a restorer who is a giver who is a granter who is a healer to a god who is a creator and i will serve him for that and i will praise him for that and i'll worship him for that and i'll use those materials to build who i am praise him praise and more hallelujah we thank you jesus thank you for your presence here with us today heavenly father we so thank you for this tremendous presence that we have felt the faithfulness of the people the so many that have gathered here today gathered with expectation coming earlier traveling even great distances not worried about the traffic upon the streets and the holiday rush that came lord even some changing holiday plans because they wanted to be in church oh talk about the future changing the present lord i pray that the people that are gathered here today could just get another dividend of eternity lord i pray that you would just give them another outpouring to encourage them and strengthen them for the journey lord we do not find what we go through now joyous but we find joy in the purpose of what we're going through how many times could we say that had we known the end we wouldn't have worried so much had we know that this is how it was going to turn out we wouldn't have fretted we wouldn't have done this we wouldn't have done that and we say it so often in the natural lord well if i knew it was going to work out i wouldn't have done this i wouldn't have paid for that i wouldn't have done this i wouldn't have did that lord that we can when it comes to our spirits and our emotions and our joy stop worrying stop fretting stop agonizing in rest victory ahead is victory now if we see victory coming we can rejoice now i don't have to wait for the victory if i know it's coming i'm not wrong to praise lord if in the world someone knows the outcome of a game and someone's watching a rerun or recording they can say over and over and over again we win we win and they're just as confident and happy that they win and no change in the score what causes them to worry lord could it be that you've provided the ultimate spoiler so your bride wouldn't worry and you told us the way it will be so that we wouldn't be so worried and frustrated and upset in the life that we're living now and just trust you i pray lord that we could accept today that the things that will be changed the way things are and we accept it lord we purpose to plow and hope and thresh and hope because we know that we will be partakers of that hope bless your people the many that are gathered here lord the some that are not able to be here lord for that person who's agonized within their hearts lord struggled to find a place of rest we invite them to come home lord find solace in your presence bless your people we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
