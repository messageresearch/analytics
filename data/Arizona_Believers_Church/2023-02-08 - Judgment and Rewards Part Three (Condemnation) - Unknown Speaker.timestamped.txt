[0:00] You can see from our title slide that
[0:02] we're speaking on the subject of
[0:03] judgment and rewards. Want to continue
[0:05] on this subject. Uh for our home folk
[0:07] here, those who've heard the first two,
[0:09] I think you'll be in a really good
[0:10] position just to understand exactly what
[0:12] our burden is in this subject matter. If
[0:15] some of you haven't heard it, our home
[0:16] folk here haven't heard it, I do
[0:18] encourage you to go back into the
[0:19] archives, listens to part one and two,
[0:21] uh because they're just real pertinent
[0:23] as we build. We're just going to be
[0:25] building slowly on this subject of
[0:26] judgment and rewards. Tonight I want to
[0:28] take the subject of condemnation and
[0:30] we're drawing it from this scripture
[0:32] here where it speaks he that has eternal
[0:34] life shall not come into condemnation.
[0:37] And I want to look at what that means.
[0:39] Uh and it's important for us at this
[0:40] point to look at this subject because is
[0:43] I've been we've already identified in
[0:45] the scripture and how brother Brandham
[0:46] relates to there is a judge there is a
[0:48] reward for our labor. And so God's going
[0:51] to judge our works to determine what
[0:53] we're rewarded with. And we don't want
[0:54] to misplace that time of judgment to
[0:56] where we get it in our minds that one
[0:58] day we're going to have to stand and be
[1:00] judged to determine our salvation. And
[1:02] so we're we're just emphasizing this
[1:04] again just as we did last uh weekend,
[1:06] this past weekend on the gift so that
[1:08] there's no doubt going forward what it
[1:10] is that brother said we ought to be
[1:12] laboring for. And Romans chapter 6 vers
[1:15] 23. Let's start with this. I think it's
[1:17] a great place to start. For the wages of
[1:19] sin is death, but the gift of God is
[1:21] eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[1:23] Lord. We saw how that wages were
[1:25] compensation or payment for service,
[1:27] payment for work, compensation for work
[1:29] that is done. And so you're paid a wage
[1:32] when you labor. Rewards are exactly the
[1:35] same thing scripturally that God gives
[1:36] you a reward for the labor that you
[1:38] undertake. So the wages of sin or death,
[1:40] that's the wrong kind of reward for the
[1:42] wrong kind of labor or the appropriate
[1:44] reward for sin. But then there's also a
[1:47] payment, a wage for the works that
[1:49] you've done to please the Lord and how
[1:51] we ought to be striving to do that. And
[1:53] brother Brandham writes at the church
[1:54] age book, all too little time is spent
[1:57] on laboring on the eternal rewards of
[1:59] God, the recompense of God is too
[2:02] lightly esteemed. If we believe in the
[2:03] reality of the resurrection of the body
[2:05] and an eternal kingdom of substance,
[2:07] then we ought to lay up in heaven those
[2:09] good treasures that are available to the
[2:11] faithful saints. So he's really specific
[2:14] that there are treasures that you by
[2:16] your laboring for him and laboring to
[2:18] please him. You take those things and
[2:20] you secure them. You deposit them in
[2:22] heaven and they become heavenly rewards
[2:24] or as he refers to them eternal rewards.
[2:27] So a gift is something that's earned.
[2:29] It's something that you labor for and
[2:30] then you're due a wage. Uh excuse me.
[2:32] The the wage is something that is earned
[2:34] you labor for and therefore you're given
[2:36] it. It's the same for a reward. It's
[2:38] something given uh given as a payment
[2:40] for labor or for a worthy behavior. So
[2:42] if you've done well and you've uh you've
[2:44] worked hard, you're worthy. Ox is worthy
[2:46] of its hire. There's a wage that is due
[2:47] them. But then we saw how the gift of
[2:50] God is right here. It says that the gift
[2:53] of God is eternal life. So that is
[2:56] something that's not earned. That is not
[2:57] something that is deserved. It's by
[2:59] sovereign grace that God gives you
[3:01] eternal life. It is according to
[3:03] election. It's not any works that you've
[3:04] done. Even you know God so far as to
[3:08] declare through Paul that even before
[3:10] either one of them had done anything God
[3:12] hated the one and loved the other.
[3:14] So it's not your works that caused this
[3:16] elective love uh to be displayed in your
[3:18] life. It's all the gift of God is
[3:20] eternal life. A gift is something that's
[3:22] voluntarily given without payment in
[3:24] return. So if God gave it to you, he as
[3:27] a gift, he's not expecting something in
[3:29] return. And aren't you glad that God's
[3:31] not like that where he gives you a gift?
[3:32] It's like, well, I gave you eternal
[3:34] life, and if you don't give me something
[3:35] back, and if you don't labor in grace,
[3:37] and you don't show something for it,
[3:38] then I'm just going to take your
[3:39] salvation away. That's not how the
[3:41] scripture puts it. That's not what the
[3:43] messenger taught us. And so, gift is
[3:45] something that's not purchased or earned
[3:47] by the recipient. And so, what we're
[3:49] looking at in that is there's a
[3:51] difference between the eternal rewards
[3:52] of God and the gift of God. The gift of
[3:55] God is eternal life. And we went through
[3:57] a number of scriptures and statements on
[3:58] Sunday to show that. And then the
[4:00] eternal uh rewards are things that God
[4:03] is going to give the believer at a time
[4:04] of judgment that have nothing to do with
[4:06] our salvation in that it's it's subject
[4:08] to being taken away. Bible says, "For by
[4:11] grace you are saved through faith." And
[4:13] this is a gift of God. It's not of
[4:14] ourselves. Nothing that we can brag
[4:16] about. Nothing that we can boast about.
[4:19] And so if I could say this and what I'm
[4:21] wanting to inspire us with, especially
[4:23] coming off the the series on the year in
[4:25] preview and encouraging us to be more
[4:27] faithful in these areas in the word. Uh
[4:29] and since I'm wanting to encourage you
[4:31] to labor for these eternal rewards, I
[4:33] think it needs uh we need to be able to
[4:35] distinguish what these rewards are from
[4:37] the gift. So we never have it in our
[4:39] minds that I'm laboring. I'm laboring to
[4:41] receive eternal life, but I'm laboring
[4:43] because I have eternal life.
[4:44] Eternal life has a way that it looks.
[4:46] Eternal life is living for others. then
[4:48] I I want to live that. I want to be a
[4:50] servant. I want to express it. I want to
[4:51] have that humility and nature of Christ
[4:53] to live his life. Now, thank you for
[4:56] your patience as we recap some of that.
[4:58] Now, if we could look at John 5:4,
[5:02] I want to begin to look closely at this
[5:04] thought of judge of condemnation. So, he
[5:07] says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[5:09] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[5:11] him that sent me hath everlasting life."
[5:14] This is a present possession for those
[5:17] that are born again. The saved presently
[5:19] possess eternal life. It's not it's not
[5:22] even just the possibility of it. It's
[5:23] not, well, if you could just keep
[5:24] holding on, you'll keep it. No, they
[5:26] presently possess eternal life and shall
[5:29] not come into condemnation, but is
[5:32] passed from death into life. So, if you
[5:35] will not come into condemnation, you've
[5:36] passed into death into life. We know
[5:37] that this means you'll come up in that
[5:39] first resurrection or you're going to go
[5:40] in the rapture. uh your your your entire
[5:43] destiny is completely changed by virtue
[5:45] of that seal. And so I think we said
[5:49] this on Sunday, this the seal of God, it
[5:51] guarantees your eternal relationship
[5:53] with God. If you have the Holy Ghost,
[5:56] you have eternal life. Then your
[5:57] position in Christ as a son of God is
[5:59] secure. Uh you have relationship with
[6:01] God. It is eternal security for the
[6:03] believer. Uh though some take that and
[6:06] they pervert it and they make it to
[6:07] something that it's not, the believer
[6:09] has eternal security in Christ. And so
[6:11] because you have eternal life, it means
[6:13] that you've bypassed and catch this and
[6:16] I know you know this so just uh humor me
[6:18] by putting it into the record. You've
[6:20] bypassed the wage that is required for
[6:22] sin.
[6:23] So if you possess eternal life and Paul
[6:25] is saying the wages of sin are death but
[6:27] if you have eternal life that's the gift
[6:29] of God and you don't have to worry about
[6:31] this death. And so he purposely puts
[6:33] them there side by side. So eternal life
[6:36] means that you've bypassed the reward
[6:38] for sin which is death.
[6:41] And death scripturally
[6:44] is and when and it's identified this way
[6:47] in particular that right here where it
[6:49] says you've passed from death unto life.
[6:51] It's a place it's the miserable state of
[6:54] the unsaved when they die.
[6:56] Right?
[6:56] Because when the believer dies, we say
[6:58] they're sleeping. Uh there's there's an
[7:00] expiration of life to the body, but
[7:01] they're not in the same place that the
[7:03] wicked are when they die. So it's a
[7:04] future misery in the afterlife. The
[7:06] Bible calls it hell. And there's
[7:08] different words that are used for it.
[7:09] Hades or shell, but it's defined as the
[7:12] grave or death. And it's where the
[7:15] unsaved go when they die. And when they
[7:17] go there, they're awaiting judgment.
[7:19] Now, I I realize there's such a
[7:21] tremendous pull tonight, and you kind of
[7:23] get more into the the the preaching
[7:24] mode. Uh but maybe it this is things
[7:27] that are uh in particular very tight
[7:29] things that you would teach and want you
[7:31] to know very clearly in the scripture.
[7:33] So, the Bible when it talks about hell,
[7:35] it's death. It's the grave. It's the
[7:37] place that the unsaved go. And it's that
[7:40] underworld of demons. Brother Brandham
[7:41] drew out these dimensions. It's the
[7:43] thing beneath us. It's below us. And so
[7:45] there's a present hell that is beneath
[7:47] us. You descend down into the pit. It's
[7:49] beneath. It's down. It's below. It's the
[7:51] region of the lost. Brother Bam taught
[7:53] us all those things. As a young boy, he
[7:55] visited this dimension. You remember how
[7:57] he described it had a feeling to it, a
[7:59] smell, and this torment, this endless
[8:01] darkness. A and and the way that he
[8:03] described it as a young boy when he saw
[8:04] it, it was so pronounced to him that
[8:07] when he broke into a vision in J Penney
[8:08] and caught that other realm, he said, "I
[8:10] was back in hell again there, right
[8:12] there at Tucson, I believe, because that
[8:13] it was so distinct." And that's a
[8:16] dimension that's very, very real. The
[8:18] Bible says in second Peter chapter 2:4,
[8:21] and if I could just back up a little
[8:23] bit, this is what Jesus is saying.
[8:25] You've passed from death into life.
[8:27] There's this place. This is a place that
[8:29] you're avoiding now that you have
[8:30] eternal life. It says, "For if God
[8:32] spared not the angels that sin, but cast
[8:34] them down to hell and deliver them into
[8:36] chains of darkness to be reserved in
[8:38] judgment." This is describing that place
[8:41] of waiting. These chains of darkness,
[8:43] reserved unto judgment. This is hell.
[8:46] This is the grave. This is Hades. This
[8:48] is shell. This is gayana is another word
[8:50] that's used for this place that the
[8:52] unrighteous, the wicked, the unsaved go
[8:54] when they die. And we understand that,
[8:56] right? We understand that if a a
[8:58] Christian dies, they don't go to the
[8:59] same place that a sinner dies.
[9:01] And this is what's being described here
[9:03] in the scripture. It's a place of
[9:04] torment and fear. I think brother called
[9:06] it a nightmare, endless and horrible.
[9:09] So there's this foreboing of judgment
[9:11] because you're uh this is cast down to
[9:14] hell where they're in chains of darkness
[9:15] reserved unto judgment. So if you're
[9:18] still subject to judgment, there's a
[9:20] place that you have to go right before
[9:23] you before you go to judgment. I know
[9:25] they kind of joke about Phoenix being uh
[9:27] heaven's waiting room with all the
[9:28] people that come here and retire. I
[9:30] think that's what they call it. Maybe
[9:31] I'm thinking of Florida. But uh that
[9:34] that this is really hell is the waiting
[9:36] room for before you go to the white
[9:38] throne.
[9:39] If you're subject to judgment, that's
[9:40] where you have to go. Now notice how
[9:42] Jesus uh breaks this out in the parable
[9:45] of the rich man in Lazarus. He says in
[9:46] Luke 16:es 22 and 24, "And it came to
[9:50] pass that the beggar died and was
[9:53] carried by the angels into Abraham's
[9:55] bosom.
[9:57] And the rich man also died and he was
[9:59] buried." So notice Jesus in his language
[10:02] is signaling that this this one who died
[10:05] was carried into Abraham's bosom by the
[10:08] angel. So he had a different resting
[10:10] place. Whereas the rich man which we
[10:12] know had the improper attitude towards
[10:13] the poor and towards this beggar, he
[10:15] went to the place that was reserved for
[10:17] him and that he just says he's buried.
[10:19] But then he describes it and in hell he
[10:21] lift up his eyes being in torments. So
[10:24] Jesus is using a parable to show us that
[10:26] there's those that'll die that go into
[10:27] he says the bosom of Abraham others who
[10:30] die who go into hell and who are
[10:32] tormented and seeth Abraham a far off
[10:34] and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried
[10:36] and said, "Father Abraham, have mercy on
[10:38] me and send Lazarus that he may dip the
[10:41] tip of his finger in water and cool my
[10:43] tongue, for I am tormented in this
[10:45] flame." Now, there's not a literal
[10:48] burning hell now as far as the lake of
[10:50] fire as it would be described, but Jesus
[10:52] is using this image of a tormenting
[10:55] place, a place where one is actually
[10:58] suffering with no end in sight.
[11:01] You think if it's torment, if it's
[11:02] torture, if it's a nightmare, if it's
[11:04] this h terrible place that life would
[11:07] expire. But it's this indeterminable
[11:10] amount of time that they would wait
[11:11] there until the judgment. They would
[11:13] maybe not even have the sense of time
[11:15] and when this is going to end. And Jesus
[11:17] is breaking out the place that the
[11:18] righteous go to. He describes it as
[11:20] Abraham's bosom. But then this other
[11:22] place where you wait judgment and it's a
[11:24] place of torment. says in uh Revelation
[11:27] 20:14, we'll come to it here in a little
[11:29] bit. It says that death and hell were
[11:32] cast into the lake of fire. It says this
[11:34] is the second death.
[11:36] The second death is the annihilation of
[11:38] death and hell. So death and hell uh are
[11:42] are places uh things that are very
[11:45] specific things that are going to be
[11:47] cast into the lake of fire where there's
[11:49] this complete annihilation of death and
[11:52] hell.
[11:53] Now, brother Brandham says in chapter
[11:56] four of the church age book, he said,
[11:57] "So the wicked shall be cast into hell,
[11:59] Hades or the grave, and hell into the
[12:01] lake of fire." So he's showing there's a
[12:02] place where the wicked go and then those
[12:04] things are even thrown into the lake of
[12:05] fire, separated from God. What a
[12:07] terrible thing that will be because the
[12:09] second death is the eternal separation
[12:11] from God. Not an eternal hell, but a
[12:14] permanent punishment.
[12:15] That's what the scriptur is implying by
[12:17] the language that's used is once you go
[12:19] there, there's no redemption from that.
[12:21] And it's not that a literal burning hell
[12:23] for eternity, but it is a permanent uh
[12:26] um damnation or eternal punishment. It
[12:28] cannot be redeemed back from that. Now
[12:30] he says, "What a terrible thing that
[12:31] would be. But with the righteous, it
[12:33] shall not be so. They don't have to
[12:35] fear. They've been redeemed by God. They
[12:38] are in his bosom. They are the
[12:41] overcomers."
[12:42] So the redeemed are in a different
[12:44] category. This is where we're wanting to
[12:46] break out the what the the gift is and
[12:48] what the benefits of the gift are
[12:50] separate from the rewards that God will
[12:51] give you. These eternal rewards that are
[12:53] uh there available for you to labor for
[12:55] the elect do not enter into death as
[12:58] others do. And so when a when a believer
[13:01] dies, he's not going to the same place
[13:02] that everyone else does without eternal
[13:04] life. He bypasses that because he has or
[13:08] she has the gift of eternal life. And
[13:10] with that gift of eternal life, she goes
[13:12] to a different place of waiting.
[13:17] And since she has that gift, the elect,
[13:19] there's no judgment or condemnation.
[13:22] Romans chapter 10 verse4. This is a very
[13:25] lengthy thought that you'll find in
[13:27] other scriptures, but this one sums it
[13:28] up so well.
[13:30] For Christ is the end of the law for
[13:32] righteousness to everyone that
[13:35] believeth. Christ is the end of judgment
[13:37] for sins.
[13:38] Because that's what the law does. that
[13:39] condemn you. Condemns you because no one
[13:41] can live perfectly. Says Christ is the
[13:43] end of judgment for sins. It's the end
[13:45] of the law for righteousness to everyone
[13:47] that believeth. In him our
[13:49] unrighteousness is paid for.
[13:52] In him our sins are atoned for. God said
[13:54] there's a price for sin. And if you've
[13:56] sinned, that soul that sinnth is worthy
[13:58] of death. Christ becomes the mercy seat,
[14:00] the propitiation, the substitute
[14:03] sacrifice for your sins. So when you're
[14:05] willing to be identified with him,
[14:07] repent of your sins, and accept the
[14:08] sacrifice, then therefore the price for
[14:11] your sins has been paid. And Paul is
[14:14] saying Christ is the end of the law for
[14:15] righteousness to them that believeth.
[14:18] It's the end of judgment for sins. And
[14:21] he said in Romans chapter 8 verses 1 to
[14:23] two, there is therefore now no
[14:26] condemnation
[14:27] to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[14:29] Why? Because there's no sin that would
[14:31] condemn you.
[14:32] None whatsoever. Isn't that the
[14:35] beautiful revelation of justification?
[14:37] You never did it in the first place. And
[14:39] I can still remember the first time I
[14:41] ever heard Brother Doug McHugh say it.
[14:43] Uh it just left an impression on me. And
[14:45] then I heard him say it later and it
[14:46] meant just as much to me the second time
[14:48] as the first time I ever heard it. But
[14:49] he was talking about how he was uh
[14:51] counseling with the young sister and she
[14:53] was going to him and she said, "Oh,
[14:54] brother Doug, but I made this mistake
[14:56] and I've done this and I've done that."
[14:57] He said, "Sister, if you told that to
[14:59] God, he'd say, "I don't know what you're
[15:01] talking about. Right.
[15:03] I I I don't know what you're talking
[15:04] about. There it's not even there
[15:07] anymore. Why? It was a perfect sacrifice
[15:10] and a perfect blood that has paid the
[15:12] price for those sins. And it's it's in
[15:14] order to liberate the believer from
[15:16] bondage.
[15:18] And so there now there is now therefore
[15:20] no condemnation to them that are in
[15:22] Christ Jesus
[15:23] who walk not after the flesh but after
[15:25] the spirit. For the law of the spirit of
[15:27] life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
[15:31] from the law of sin and death.
[15:34] Amen.
[15:35] The law of sin and death is the very law
[15:37] that Jesus is referring to when he says,
[15:38] "He that believeth on me hath
[15:40] everlasting life and shall not come into
[15:43] condemnation, but is passed already from
[15:45] death into life."
[15:46] That by faith, believing and receiving
[15:49] that gift of eternal life through the
[15:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're no
[15:52] longer subject to this condemnation for
[15:54] sin. the price has already been paid.
[15:58] And that that condemnation both in John
[16:00] chapter 5 and then here in Romans 8, it
[16:02] means judgment.
[16:03] It speaks of being separated out and
[16:06] it's and it's in a it's in a fearful
[16:08] sense because it speaks of damnatory
[16:10] judgment. In other words, you're being
[16:11] judged to determine punishment or
[16:14] there's a possibility of punishment that
[16:17] if you stand there and I was reading the
[16:18] quote again today where brother Bam is
[16:21] talking about, you know, shoot me with
[16:22] the machine gun, tear me limb for limb,
[16:24] open me up, but whatever you do, don't
[16:25] have me stand before white throne
[16:26] judgment because before that judgment
[16:28] seat, the only thing that there's a pos
[16:30] the possibility of being poured out upon
[16:32] you is punishment.
[16:34] But for the believer, they bypass that
[16:36] alto together. There is absolutely I I
[16:38] hope that you can get this because I
[16:40] think in some ways the devil's become an
[16:42] expert at Mhm. you're going to lose your
[16:44] sunship, right? He's just so wellversed
[16:46] in trying to make us feel like we can
[16:47] lose our election. That's impossible.
[16:50] It is absolutely impossible for you to
[16:52] lose lose your election. Now, I guess
[16:54] it's we know it's possible that some
[16:56] people could think they're elected and
[16:57] they're not, but I'm not talking to
[16:59] anybody like that, right?
[17:01] And so there's this this sense that I'm
[17:03] wanting you to recognize in this that
[17:05] this place where he says there is no
[17:06] more condemnation. There is no threat of
[17:09] future punishment.
[17:13] This damnation as it would be called in
[17:15] the scripture.
[17:17] There's no threat of separation from
[17:18] God. There's no threat of future
[17:20] punishment. Why? Because the elect
[17:23] having received the gift do not have to
[17:25] be afraid that God will take it back.
[17:27] Amen. and be subject to hell again.
[17:31] In John 11 25 and 26, he says, "I am the
[17:37] resurrection and the life."
[17:39] What beautiful uh placing in positioning
[17:42] to those Mary and Martha who believed in
[17:45] a resurrection and were even testifying
[17:47] that I know my brother, he'll live again
[17:48] one day in the resurrection. And that's
[17:50] the mindset of the resurrection. It's a
[17:52] particular point on the calendar or
[17:54] something along a continuum. And Jesus
[17:55] saying, "Let me upset that a little bit.
[17:57] I am the resurrection.
[17:59] I am the resurrection and the life. And
[18:01] he says, though he were dead, he that
[18:03] believeth in me, though he were dead,
[18:05] yet shall he live.
[18:06] So in this in this sense, he's
[18:08] describing the sleeping saints.
[18:10] That's right.
[18:10] Which which Lazarus represented the
[18:13] believer who that blood relation who is
[18:15] there sleeping. And brother Bam even
[18:17] uses this as an example of the voice of
[18:19] the resurrection. He that believeth in
[18:21] me, though he were dead, yet shall he
[18:23] live. And then the next, whosoever
[18:25] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[18:27] die.
[18:28] There's the living saints, those that
[18:29] are alive and remain at the coming of
[18:31] the Lord. It's those that Paul would
[18:33] say, we may we don't all we won't all
[18:35] sleep,
[18:36] but we shall all be changed.
[18:39] That's the promise for the believer that
[18:40] goes to sleep and the one that passes by
[18:42] way of a physical death. That's the
[18:44] promise to those that are alive and
[18:45] remain. Jesus said, "He that believeth
[18:47] in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
[18:50] live again. And he that liveth and
[18:52] believeth in me, he shall never die.
[18:54] He's prophesying of the resurrection and
[18:56] the rapture of the bride.
[19:00] We shall all be changed.
[19:02] This is the benefit of the gift.
[19:05] When a believer dies, they don't go to
[19:06] hell.
[19:07] They don't go to the grave in the sense
[19:09] of waiting for judgment. They enter in
[19:11] beyond the curtain of time.
[19:13] Right? They enter into a different place
[19:15] where all the elect are waiting. And and
[19:17] I know what we want to do is we want to
[19:19] begin to imagine that. And we could take
[19:20] the things brother Brandham described,
[19:22] but what you'll probably be doing is
[19:24] taking everything you know through 10
[19:26] human senses of the of the body and the
[19:28] spirit and trying to figure that out
[19:30] over there what that place is like. And
[19:33] brother like I can't describe it. It was
[19:34] sublime. It was perfection beyond
[19:36] perfection. Like don't even try to say
[19:37] it. The only thing he could talk about
[19:39] is the absence of certain feelings. He
[19:41] just couldn't describe it.
[19:43] So before you try to figure all that
[19:45] out, right? We can let's believe in it.
[19:48] But so this that even if you begin to
[19:50] think of it this way that well there's
[19:52] going to be a thousand-y year millennium
[19:53] but you know a thousand years a day
[19:55] right to God and so that time whatever
[19:58] whatever their sense of time is in that
[20:01] dimension you wonder if it's not just
[20:03] one after another has just like this
[20:05] been entering on beyond the curtain of
[20:07] time and for them it's it there's a
[20:09] sense of waiting but it's not drawn out
[20:11] the same way that we would feel it.
[20:14] The believer goes in beyond the curtain
[20:15] of time in a dimension where the
[20:16] redeemed are waiting what? The fullness
[20:18] of redemption.
[20:20] And so those that sleep, those that are
[20:22] dead in Christ, those that have received
[20:24] that gift of eternal life through the
[20:26] new birth when they die, they're not
[20:28] going to hell. They're not going to the
[20:29] grave. They're not waiting for judgment.
[20:31] Therefore, there that's why the the
[20:33] Bible says there is no condemnation.
[20:36] There is no judgment to determine a
[20:38] penalty. I hope you catch this because
[20:41] I'm want to identify in the scripture in
[20:42] the message of the hour that will there
[20:44] will be a time when we will all be held
[20:46] accountable for our works
[20:48] and our work is going to be judged but
[20:50] not to determine penalty
[20:52] to determine rewards.
[20:53] Amen.
[20:55] In Hebrews chapter 9 27 and 28 and it is
[20:57] as it is appointed unto men once to die
[21:00] but after this the judgment this
[21:03] judgment is damnation or condemnation
[21:05] that's the same trial or separation to
[21:07] determine punishment. This is this is
[21:08] the lot for all men. But because this is
[21:11] appointed unto men once to die and after
[21:13] this judgment. So Christ was once
[21:15] offered to bear the sins of many.
[21:19] Maybe not all men, right? Even though it
[21:21] paid the price, he bears the sins of
[21:22] many. And unto them that look for him
[21:24] shall he appear the second time without
[21:27] sin unto salvation. So he comes the
[21:31] second time not to pay the price for
[21:33] salvation, not to deal with sin, but to
[21:36] resurrect and rapture the sinless.
[21:39] Why? Because he uh Christ was offered to
[21:42] bear the sins of many for the men who
[21:44] were appointed to die and then face
[21:46] judgment.
[21:47] Two things are certain. I know that we
[21:48] believe that there's two things are
[21:50] certain, death and taxes, but there was
[21:51] a third one that was certain and it's
[21:53] judgment,
[21:54] right? That this is all men being
[21:56] convicted of sin and being guilty of
[21:57] sin. you're going to there's there's
[21:59] death, tax, taxes, death, and judgment.
[22:04] And this it's a certainty. But now that
[22:06] Christ has died, he deals with sin,
[22:09] which death is the wage for, right?
[22:11] And that if he deals with sin, he deals
[22:13] with the judgment.
[22:15] It's already been judged in Christ.
[22:18] Brother Bram says the one who ones who
[22:19] qualify for the first resurrection, the
[22:21] bride, are not in the judgment. Amen.
[22:26] So, if you'll turn with me to Matthew
[22:28] chapter 25, there's so many different
[22:30] scriptures we could use to express this.
[22:33] But as I read this, we're going to be
[22:35] identifying points in points of judgment
[22:38] that the bride is not being judged in.
[22:41] But I'm wanting I'm sharing this to
[22:43] focus on how the bride or the elect are
[22:45] not judged for punishment. They're not
[22:47] judged to be condemned. And we're not
[22:50] wanting to take the time to just teach
[22:52] very plainly on who these other groups
[22:55] are. We just merely want to distinguish
[22:57] the benefit of the gift, the benefits of
[23:00] the gift from the rewards. And I believe
[23:02] to do so, it's necessary to distinguish
[23:04] the elect from those who face the
[23:05] judgment throne or white throne
[23:07] judgment. And so in Matthew chap 25:es
[23:11] 31 and 32, when the son of man shall
[23:13] come in his glory and all the angels
[23:15] with him, then shall he sit upon the
[23:18] throne of his glory, and before him
[23:20] shall be gathered all nations, and he
[23:22] shall separate them one from another, as
[23:25] a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[23:28] goats.
[23:29] So now in this particular judgment
[23:30] scene, the bride is there, but she's
[23:32] part of the judge.
[23:34] She's there with him in his throne. the
[23:36] bride is judging because there's no
[23:37] condemnation. So therefore, she's not
[23:39] subject to this separating. There's
[23:40] going to be a separating time at white
[23:42] throne. And in maybe I I don't know if I
[23:45] should say this. Uh we know the bride is
[23:47] being judged right now by the word.
[23:49] She's being separated out by the word.
[23:51] The b the Bible revelations 18:4 in this
[23:54] age in this day has cried out to us,
[23:56] come out from among her. Why? Because
[23:58] there's going to be judgment upon her.
[24:00] And so we've been separated out already
[24:01] and we're being judged by the word. And
[24:04] since we've already been judged by the
[24:05] word, we can sit here and rule and reign
[24:07] with him in judgment. So in this scene,
[24:10] the bride is there with Christ or with
[24:11] the son of man. But it's now a time of
[24:14] separating where all nations are going
[24:16] to be come before the Lord and he shall
[24:19] separate them one from another as a
[24:21] shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[24:23] goats. Now often the question comes up
[24:25] when we look at white throne judgment is
[24:27] well who are these righteous and uh and
[24:29] who are the sheep? And it speaks of the
[24:32] righteous because God in his mercy and
[24:35] grace approves them at white throne.
[24:37] So the righteousness is of a matter of
[24:40] acceptance or approval. And here it's
[24:42] just a figure of speech to talk about
[24:44] this. These aren't his sheep. It's him
[24:46] as a shepherd as a shepherd dividing
[24:48] sheep from goats.
[24:49] Brother Benham identifies it very
[24:51] clearly in chapter 7 of the church age
[24:52] book. To further clarify, notice
[24:55] specifically the words of Matthew
[24:56] 25:31-46.
[24:58] It does not say that a shepherd is
[25:00] literally separating sheep from goats.
[25:03] But it is as a shepherd dividing sheep
[25:05] from goats. These are not sheep in this
[25:08] particular area of time. White throne
[25:10] judgment. The sheep are in his fold.
[25:13] They heard his voice word and they
[25:15] followed him. And here he he he kind of
[25:18] he yells again in all caps. They already
[25:21] have eternal life and cannot come into
[25:24] the judgment.
[25:26] Think how simple that is. Come on.
[25:27] Listen. And the Baptists do not own
[25:29] eternal life.
[25:30] They do not own being saved. And
[25:32] sometimes there's just too many
[25:33] bentecostals in the message or just
[25:35] plain Baptist. And they and they get
[25:37] their minds fixed on this idea of being
[25:39] saved and salvation. Eternal life is
[25:41] kind of just being this general thing
[25:42] that Baptists have. But this is for the
[25:44] elect. They already have eternal life.
[25:46] They cannot come into judgment. I don't
[25:49] know if I have it here, but brother Bam
[25:50] says they come up in judgment because
[25:52] they didn't have eternal life seeing
[25:54] that they weren't members of the bride.
[25:56] Amen.
[25:57] So, this is the white throne judgment.
[25:59] We see it described here in Revelations
[26:00] chapter 20. I think I might say only 12
[26:02] and 13, but we're going to go all the
[26:04] way to 15. Says, "I saw the dead, small
[26:06] and great, stand before God, and the
[26:08] books were open. And another book was
[26:10] opened, which was which is the book of
[26:12] life. And the dead, remember, that's not
[26:15] the bride. That's not the elect.
[26:19] These are those that
[26:21] are
[26:23] as
[26:24] goats and sheep being separated." This
[26:26] is before the throne of glory. Brother
[26:29] man called it the white throne judgment.
[26:31] This is the scripture describing that
[26:32] scene. The dead were judged out of those
[26:34] things which were written in the books
[26:35] according to their works.
[26:39] So white throne judgment is it's not
[26:41] it's not I think there's just I don't
[26:44] believe that you can even separate the
[26:46] price and the penalty that's paid for
[26:48] all sin from this moment.
[26:51] But he's looking at their works to
[26:53] determine what they receive.
[26:55] And it's these very things that cause
[26:57] the legalist and the Armenians to look
[27:00] at a worksbased judgment. Works based
[27:02] judgment. They say, "Well, it's very
[27:03] clear in the scripture that he's going
[27:05] to judge works." Absolutely. He's going
[27:06] to judge works. So, it just depends on
[27:08] who you are. If your bride, your
[27:10] salvation is by the work of Christ
[27:12] alone. If you're not, then that's the
[27:14] way you're getting in
[27:16] because you're judged according to their
[27:17] works. It says, "And the sea gave up the
[27:20] dead which were in it, and death and
[27:21] hell delivered up the death which were
[27:23] in them. And they were judged, every man
[27:25] according to their works, and death and
[27:27] hell were cast in a lake of fire." This
[27:29] is the second death. And whosoever was
[27:32] not found written in the book of life
[27:34] was cast into the lake of fire.
[27:37] You have those names in the record of
[27:39] the lamb's life whose names can never be
[27:41] removed.
[27:42] But then you have the entire record of
[27:43] the wheat plant that has the names of
[27:45] all that have ever lived. Brother Bam
[27:47] teaches us from that record names can be
[27:49] removed
[27:50] based upon their deeds. Right?
[27:52] Your names can never be replaced or
[27:54] removed based upon one deed.
[27:57] Right?
[27:57] A sacrifice
[27:59] an act of election. Christ Jesus says
[28:01] that those that you've given me none I
[28:03] will lose none of them.
[28:05] But in this record of all life it's the
[28:07] record of the wheat plant. All those
[28:08] who've come up and and served some
[28:10] purpose. God is still going to have
[28:12] mercy upon this plant, upon those who
[28:14] live their lives and were given
[28:16] opportunities and they're going to be
[28:17] judged according to their works. And if
[28:18] their names remain, he says, if their
[28:21] names do not remain, they're cast into
[28:23] the lake of fire.
[28:25] Brother Bam, he says they had they
[28:27] already had eternal life and cannot come
[28:29] into judgment. Now, he continues, but
[28:31] these do not have eternal life and they
[28:33] are in the judgment. Notice the
[28:35] requirement, right? The requirement
[28:38] between those who stand in judgment and
[28:40] those who do not is those that have
[28:42] eternal life. Now listen, I love the
[28:44] third pool.
[28:46] I love the seven thunders. I was
[28:49] actually thinking of a sermon the other
[28:50] day called Thunders 2.0, but it's
[28:51] probably not what you're thinking, but I
[28:53] I love the deep things. I love what God
[28:55] has done in under the opening of the
[28:57] word. I I love the uh the the the seven
[28:59] seals that Brother Brandham preached. I
[29:00] love the who is this Melzdc and what is
[29:02] the attraction and the fulfillment of
[29:04] Luke 17:30 and the commencing of 1
[29:07] Thessalonians 4 uh 16. I love these
[29:09] things.
[29:11] But the Bible has a way of just
[29:12] referring to it as eternal life.
[29:15] What? Because that's Christ.
[29:17] That's Zoe. That's God's life. It's his
[29:18] life. It's his mind. It's his
[29:20] understanding. And that's what it
[29:22] pertains to. All these things pertain to
[29:23] this. And he's saying, "Oh, but these do
[29:25] not have eternal life. And because they
[29:26] don't have eternal life, they go into
[29:28] judgment. They are allowed to go into
[29:31] eternal life.
[29:32] Remember that even in the eighth day and
[29:34] eternity, they partake of the tree of
[29:35] life for the healing of the nations to
[29:37] perpetuate life eternally.
[29:39] But we won't have to do it.
[29:41] Right?
[29:42] But upon what grounds do they enter into
[29:43] eternal life or to life eternal?
[29:46] Certainly not upon the fact that they
[29:47] already have his life as does the bride.
[29:49] But they receive it because they were
[29:51] kind to his brethren. He's identifying a
[29:53] very specific class of people. They are
[29:54] not his brethren. That would make them
[29:56] joint hes with Jesus. They are not heirs
[29:59] to anything but life. So there's more,
[30:01] right? There's more that pertains to
[30:02] this. They share no throne with him,
[30:04] throne, etc. with him. Their names must
[30:07] have been in the book of life and not
[30:08] removed. Now because of their love of
[30:11] the people of God, they are recognized
[30:13] and saved.
[30:15] It's still God's grace.
[30:18] Because I I tell you, if you if those
[30:20] that experience that, you won't find
[30:21] them bragging one bit when they get in.
[30:24] Like, man, I was in that line and I was
[30:26] toast. I knew I was going to die, but I
[30:29] guess I did. I What he's told me is I
[30:31] when one of his own was thirsty, I gave
[30:33] him a glass of water. And I'm here for
[30:35] that. There'll still be a rejoicing.
[30:37] There'll still be a recognition that in
[30:39] so as much you did it unto the least of
[30:40] these, you've done it unto me and still
[30:42] go, "Oh, thank you. Thank you for having
[30:44] grace. Thank you for having mercy."
[30:45] There won't be one braggard there.
[30:48] They're recognized and saved.
[30:50] Now, if we could, we're making excellent
[30:52] time. And brother Asher, I'm not going
[30:53] to forget, but remind me if it seems
[30:55] like I do. In John 5:es 24-29,
[31:00] he says, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[31:02] you, he that heareth my word and
[31:03] believeth on him that sent me hath
[31:05] everlasting life and shall not come into
[31:08] condemnation, but is passed from death
[31:11] unto life." I believe Brother Brandham
[31:12] does such a thoroughly wonderful job of
[31:14] breaking the scripture down and making
[31:16] it so plain to us what it means. I trust
[31:18] that we have this understanding that we
[31:20] have eternal life now. We will not stand
[31:22] before judgment because we've already
[31:24] passed from death into unto life. If the
[31:26] believer who has received everlasting
[31:27] life according to the scripture dies, he
[31:29] goes, he's asleep as Paul would say it,
[31:32] he's in another dimension altogether,
[31:34] not waiting judgment, but waiting
[31:36] fullness of redemption,
[31:37] waiting to receive that glorified body.
[31:41] And then verse 25, verily, verily, I say
[31:44] unto you, the hour is coming, and now is
[31:47] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[31:49] the Son of God, and they that hear shall
[31:51] live. For as the Father hath life in
[31:53] himself, so hath he given to the Son to
[31:55] have life in himself, and have given him
[31:58] authority to execute judgment also,
[32:01] because he is the Son of Man. If I could
[32:04] say this just to wet your appetite a
[32:05] little bit, the Son of Man is judgment,
[32:07] a judgment dispensation. But I know
[32:09] immediately we think judgment, oh no
[32:11] horror. But it also comes with
[32:13] vindication,
[32:14] right?
[32:15] It comes to avenge, to declare worthy,
[32:17] to declare righteous. You have to have
[32:19] judgment to be declared righteous.
[32:21] Right? There has to be some judgment
[32:22] passed. So we're not afraid of the
[32:25] sentence.
[32:26] Right? The bride is not afraid of let it
[32:29] come forth from your mouth. We're
[32:30] willing to receive it. and and we're
[32:32] willing even now to subject ourselves to
[32:34] correction because we know that it's not
[32:37] there's no eternal punishment that comes
[32:39] with it. We we shouldn't ever be afraid
[32:41] to be examined by the word and find out
[32:43] we're wrong.
[32:44] If the zeal of the age is to repent,
[32:46] let's not be afraid to say we're sorry.
[32:47] Let's not be afraid to own it if we make
[32:49] a mistake. Yeah, I shouldn't have done
[32:50] that. Yeah, I made a mistake. Because
[32:52] that has no indication whatsoever of
[32:54] your election or even your seal. It
[32:56] actually is a better indication that you
[32:57] might have it
[32:59] when you're willing to be repent,
[33:00] willing to say you're sorry, willing to
[33:02] humble yourself.
[33:07] And so there's that there's this
[33:08] dispensation of judgment that comes when
[33:10] the son of man is revealed. And we see
[33:12] this. He says, "I say the hour is coming
[33:14] and now is that the dead are going to
[33:16] hear the voice of the son of God and
[33:17] live." So he's talking about something
[33:18] very particular. Then he changes. He
[33:21] says, "Marvel not at this, for the hour
[33:23] is coming in the which all that are in
[33:25] the graves shall hear his voice and
[33:28] shall come forth they that have done
[33:30] good unto the resurrection of life, and
[33:32] they that have done evil unto the
[33:33] resurrection of damnation."
[33:36] Jesus is referred to two different
[33:37] groups in these scriptures. You have a
[33:40] group that's referenced in verses 24 to
[33:41] 27, an entirely different group that's
[33:44] referenced in re verses 28 and 29.
[33:47] These last two verses, marvel not that
[33:49] the hour is coming when all that are in
[33:50] the graves will hear his voice and come
[33:52] forth to be judged. One to a
[33:55] resurrection of life and one to the
[33:57] resurrection of damnation. This is the
[33:58] general resurrection.
[34:00] All are raised to stand before the
[34:03] judgment throne. This is not the
[34:05] rapture. So what brother Bam teaches us,
[34:07] this is not the rapture because in the
[34:08] rapture only the dead in Christ and the
[34:11] living bride are raised. Right?
[34:13] But now Jesus saying all that are in the
[34:15] grave. So, there's going to be a time
[34:16] when all that are in the graves are
[34:18] going to be raised up. They're going to
[34:19] have to stand before white throne
[34:20] judgment uh to be judged according to
[34:22] their works.
[34:24] And since they're not born again, they
[34:26] come up in the se second resurrection to
[34:28] be judged. You understand that? I know
[34:29] this is this ought to be familiar to all
[34:32] of us. But the reason why I'm doing it
[34:33] is not because I don't think you know
[34:34] it. I'm doing it because I'm going I'm
[34:36] wanting to look at how that the bride is
[34:38] judged to determine a reward. And I
[34:40] don't want you to confuse it at all with
[34:42] any any other judgment. Right?
[34:44] The judgment seat of Christ ought not to
[34:46] be confused with this white throne
[34:47] judgment. Because if you're judged at
[34:49] white throne judgment, then there's
[34:51] still the threat of punishment.
[34:54] And the bride has passed that. She's
[34:55] passed condemnation. There is no
[34:57] condemnation.
[34:59] This is how brother Brandham treats it
[35:00] in question and answers in 1961. He
[35:02] says, "Let's brother," he says, "Let's
[35:04] see, brother Brandham. What happens to
[35:05] the people that are considered the
[35:06] sleeping virgin when they're judged at
[35:09] the judgment?" Well, the sleeping virgin
[35:11] will be saved, of course. Of course,
[35:14] she'll be saved at the judgment. She'll
[35:16] never be the bride, but she is a saved
[35:19] group of people that will come up in the
[35:22] judgment that will not be included in
[35:24] the bride. But as long as they're
[35:26] virgins, they are before God. They are
[35:28] to be saved. He separates.
[35:31] There'll be the sheep on his right side,
[35:33] and the unsaved will be the goats on his
[35:34] left at the great white throne judgment.
[35:36] Amen.
[35:37] And so, we find this in the church age
[35:39] book. We find it in other places.
[35:40] Brother Brandham deals with it. There
[35:41] are groups of saved. He refers here to
[35:44] the the ver the virgins, the foolish
[35:46] virgins here. We know there's Jews that
[35:48] are going to be saved and then those
[35:49] that are good to the brethren. He's
[35:50] already identified that there are he
[35:52] says they are a saved group. There's
[35:54] other groups that are going to be saved.
[35:56] I know we can get in our minds that when
[35:58] we we could get this idea that there's
[36:00] uh and that's the danger maybe of uh
[36:03] of how the the human mind works. We say
[36:05] only the only the bride is saved. Yes,
[36:07] the bride alone possesses eternal life
[36:09] now because it's only the elect or the
[36:11] church of God, sons and daughters of God
[36:12] that are going to go up in the first
[36:13] resurrection. But there's promises for
[36:15] those who are outside of even that
[36:17] relationship with God that he'll have
[36:19] mercy on. And so there'll be many more
[36:21] saved at that day. There'll be many,
[36:23] many that enter into eternal life. And
[36:25] you know what? You don't want to have
[36:26] the wrong attitude towards them
[36:28] because that wouldn't be becoming of a
[36:30] Christian.
[36:31] As brother Brandham says, a bride don't
[36:33] persecute bride. Why not? Because bride
[36:35] don't persecute anybody.
[36:36] Amen.
[36:37] Right. It's like that's the main thing.
[36:39] The bride doesn't persecute anybody. And
[36:41] because she doesn't persecute anybody,
[36:43] she's never guilty of persecuting the
[36:44] bride.
[36:45] Amen.
[36:47] So there will be groups saved at white
[36:49] throne judgment.
[36:51] But verses 24 to 27, those who hear the
[36:54] voice of the son of God and live,
[36:55] completely different group altogether.
[36:58] They're those who are li while alive.
[37:00] They hear the voice of God. They hear
[37:02] the voice of salvation. My sheep hear my
[37:04] voice
[37:06] and they don't follow any other pe Paul
[37:09] called it being quickened from death
[37:11] unto life. Why? Because we were dead in
[37:14] sins and trespasses,
[37:15] right? You hath he quickened. And so
[37:18] there is a quickening from death. It's
[37:19] exactly what Jesus is saying. You're
[37:21] going to hear the voice of God and it's
[37:23] going to give you a resurrection here. A
[37:25] resurrection of the soul a out of out of
[37:27] death. Completely remove that stain upon
[37:30] the soul. Because once the soul is
[37:32] sealed, the soul is in the eighth day,
[37:34] literally, right? Well, I mean, that's
[37:36] how brother Bam puts it in future home.
[37:37] He's saying the soul is sealed and
[37:39] there's nothing more that can be added
[37:40] to the soul to make it any more perfect.
[37:42] Once the soul is sealed, you can't say,
[37:44] "Ah, you know what? I think you just
[37:45] need a little bit more left-hand holy
[37:46] ghost." Uh-uh. It's already perfect. No,
[37:49] I think what you need is a little right
[37:50] hand holy. No. Uh-uh. Already perfect.
[37:53] The soul is perfect sealed. The devil
[37:55] can't get you. You're eternally secure.
[37:57] And what God calls calls the seal is the
[38:00] earnest, the down payment, the guarantee
[38:02] of the resurrection, the guarantee of
[38:05] the fullness of redemption. Those are
[38:07] the benefits of the gift.
[38:09] And therefore, no one should ever use
[38:12] scriptures pertaining to rewards or
[38:14] things, crowns that'll be handed out to
[38:16] ever try to bully the believer from
[38:18] claiming every single benefit that is
[38:20] available to those who have eternal
[38:22] life. Because if you have just a
[38:24] spoonful of the ocean, you have every
[38:27] single element that's in the ocean.
[38:32] I think I'm I I I guess I'll just I'll
[38:35] it won't become as a surprise to
[38:37] anybody. I just wish I would have
[38:38] written it down, but if I could if I
[38:39] could remember what it says there
[38:41] there's more elements in one spoonful of
[38:44] the ocean than there are spoonfuls of
[38:46] the ocean.
[38:49] Okay. So when brother Brandham says you
[38:51] just got a spoonful, don't think for
[38:53] your minutes it's like, well, I guess I
[38:55] got to measure. No, you having it with
[38:58] measure, it's still limitless,
[39:01] with measure without limitation,
[39:03] right? It's going to operate according
[39:04] to the law of faith. So let's not dumb
[39:06] down the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Dumb
[39:08] don't dumb down eternal life. Embrace it
[39:11] for all that it is because these are the
[39:13] benefits of the gift. Amen.
[39:17] The bride,
[39:19] those that hear the voice of the son of
[39:20] God and live, this is the bride. She
[39:24] does not have to face condemnation.
[39:26] Therefore, all fear should be crossed
[39:27] out.
[39:29] So much of what the word is trying to do
[39:30] is wash away fear. Brother Bam, when he
[39:32] dealt with election and predestination,
[39:34] he said, "I'm trying to I'm trying to
[39:35] get rid of the scare the scare and the
[39:36] fear. I
[39:38] I'm wanting to get that away. I'm not
[39:39] trying to scare you. I'm trying to drive
[39:40] it away from you." In 1 John chapter 5
[39:45] 11-13
[39:48] he says and this is the record
[39:50] that God hath given to us eternal life
[39:53] and this life is in his son. So if you
[39:55] have it you have to be in him.
[39:59] He that hath the son hath life has to be
[40:02] by one spirit that you've been baptized
[40:04] in this body. This is the only way that
[40:05] you could have this life. This is the
[40:07] record. This is a different record.
[40:10] There's going to be a judgment when
[40:11] books are open and books are going to be
[40:13] all opened up and they're going to be
[40:14] judged according to their works. But
[40:16] this is your record. Your record is that
[40:18] you have eternal life because he's given
[40:20] it to you through the son.
[40:23] He that hath the son hath life. He that
[40:24] hath not the son of God hath not life.
[40:27] These things have I written unto you
[40:28] that believe on the name of the son of
[40:30] God that you may know that you have
[40:32] eternal life. So this is not a new
[40:34] problem.
[40:35] He wanted them to know what they had.
[40:37] that you may know that you have eternal
[40:38] life and that you may believe on the
[40:40] name of the son of God.
[40:42] Just trying to encourage them in this
[40:44] gift to enjoy all the benefits of it. We
[40:48] shouldn't live below any of our
[40:50] privileges as a son or daughter of God.
[40:52] My last statement I'd like to read to
[40:54] you again from the church age book
[40:55] chapter 7. Brother says that great royal
[40:58] seed Jesus Christ was planted. He died
[41:01] and that life that was in him came up
[41:02] through the wheat plant and is
[41:04] reproducing itself in multitudes of
[41:06] wheat seeds having the same life in them
[41:09] and being like the original because by
[41:12] spirit they are original.
[41:15] Now we can see why the redeemed brought
[41:17] back by the original owner bride. She
[41:19] was in him as Eve was in Adam cannot
[41:21] ever have her member names taken off the
[41:24] record.
[41:25] Amen. So he said, "Now we can see why
[41:28] the redeemed bride cannot have her
[41:30] member names taken off the record. She
[41:33] was in Christ just as Eve was in Adam.
[41:35] She's been brought back by the original
[41:37] owner. She can't have her member names
[41:39] taken off the record." This is the
[41:41] record that God hath given unto us
[41:43] eternal life.
[41:45] She is a part of him. She is in the
[41:47] throne. She can never be judged.
[41:50] Amen.
[41:52] Everyone in the bride is a member of him
[41:54] and he loses none.
[41:56] There is therefore now no condemnation
[42:00] to those that are in Christ Jesus. Why?
[42:02] Because if you're in him, if you have
[42:03] the son, you have eternal life. He that
[42:06] believeth on me, you have everlasting
[42:08] life. You shall not come into judgment.
[42:10] You don't have to stand before white
[42:12] judgment to determine whether or not
[42:13] your sins or your works will merit you
[42:15] life or hell. You have been deemed
[42:18] judicially righteous. Amen.
[42:20] As a matter of fact, brother Brandham
[42:22] came in this hour and and identified the
[42:24] wigged one. There he was, the supreme
[42:26] being, the supreme judge, and he
[42:28] pronounced your sentence sinless. He
[42:31] said, "Justified without spot or
[42:33] wrinkle, as if you've never done it in
[42:37] the first place." He wasn't even looking
[42:39] at your good works, let alone your bad
[42:41] works.
[42:42] He's declared you righteous.
[42:44] Therefore, there is no threat of
[42:46] judgment. There is no threat of
[42:47] punishment.
[42:48] Amen.
[42:49] You're free. There is no condemnation
[42:53] to them that are in Christ Jesus. Oh,
[42:56] praise the Lord
[42:58] to be
