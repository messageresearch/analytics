TRANSCRIPT
========================================
turn your bibles to john chapter six thank you musicians appreciate appreciated the worship this morning john chapter 6 verses 22 to 35. john chapter 6 is a very familiar chapter for us as message believers especially in that jesus begins to identify himself as the bread of life and he's uh it's placed in the context of now he's opening up the word and there's what is what is your attraction what is it you're coming to see and so there's a lot that we could emphasize in terms of the third pool and the opening of the word and it has that tremendous significance to us and that's kind of what has inspired me this today i don't think i'll get to into those things uh this morning uh but just i wanted to mention that at the outset before we begin to read that that's kind of this is the that's the context and so some of this is the background to um those things that we see later on in this chapter verse 22 john chapter 6 verse 22 the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there saved that one where unto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberius nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hithered jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefore unto him we what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what doest thou work our fathers did eat man in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god which is he excuse me the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then they said unto him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst amen you can be seated i feel over this past week my voice started getting a little bit strained i'm not sure what it's from but pray for me that my we are able to screech out the message today i feel very very inspired to speak and my title is hungry it's a question hungry and in my mind i had um i was just laying before the lord yesterday morning and just wanting to know um what would be relevant i just feel like the word is so rich and so deep you always have something to share there's always something you can express there's always a truth that we could just take time to teach and it would be beneficial to us but i really i really labor and desire to to find the right thing at the right moment spiritual food and due season and i was just laying and praying and just would say lord just speak to me speak to me what specifically would you have me to speak on and this was it was just hunger this hungry is what popped in my head and it was almost as if i had seen in my mind i just remember seeing this billboard that had the question hungry and and it was just always you know just repetitive and i think i was somehow conflating that with the thing anybody seen the billboard for the thing and uh so i was uh that was kind of what prompted it i thought well it's not i don't want to preach about the thing um but uh yeah i wanted i even thought i'd be nice if i could find a picture of that billboard and uh and i don't even know if the billboard exists if somehow the thing became hungry uh but that's what that's what dropped in my heart is just ask this question like are you hungry is there is there a hunger there and i feel directed to speak to those who are ordained to crave god and there is uh maybe you could say it here at the outset that perhaps you're not uh you're not placated with the status quo religion isn't satisfying uh just you know church a church experience you know has never done it for you if anything perhaps maybe those experiences have only made it harder for you to seek the thing which you crave or maybe it's just a general unsettledness or unhappiness to where you just you're not really finding that real contentment despite all the things that you seem to accomplish and all the other things in life that seem to go well there's just deep down inside you don't even feel comfortable in your own skin because you haven't really come to this place of rest so you know there's a longing and a hunger that hasn't been satisfied and so i believe that god is going to be addressing some very specific things and needs and this is a matter of life i guess it's a matter of life or death but i don't know that i'm necessarily wanting to uh you know raise the specter of death but it's it has to be on that level of desperation that this is a matter of life this is a matter of peace and in that will be uh perhaps just trying to turn things over in your heart to cause you to ask yourself what really matters and i think this will grow apparent as we lay our foundation in terms of what is your biggest motivator what is it that's motivating you and driving you kind of like your you know governing principle in your life we'll have limited slides i'm just going to provide slides i think for the most part for these large scripture readings that we are going to have in john chapter six and then a little bit in john chapter four i'd like for you to be able if you could just stay focused if you're not familiar um maybe with my the manner in which i can preach i may not it may not look like i'm going anywhere for a while but i trust by the end you're like okay all right now it all makes sense so stay with me stay with me and i believe that we'll end up at somewhere special so in john chapter six and i and i i'm really laying the foundation to be able to go into a lot more different areas i think that'll be very exciting as a congregation so my title is hungry are you hungry gee that's what we might say in north carolina g uh and uh but we're wanting to ask this question are you hungry is there hunger in your heart so in john chapter 6 i'm just going to jump into it give a little background and just start reading through our text again in john chapter 6 it opens with jesus feeding over 5 000 people with five loaves of bread the bible calls it barley loaves and two small fishes uh they speculate that these would have been two little small dried fish or pickled fish and he had just fed over 5000 people the bible tells us in matthew chapter 14 that it was over it was 5 000 men not counting the women and children so how's that from misogyny in the scripture but uh they they only counted the five thousand men and this is so we know they would have fed much more than just five thousand so jesus had just performed this miracle of taking five barley loaves and two fish and feeding over 5000 people and the word in the scripture when it says fish is the word is actually used in the hebrew and as it would have been used even in the context of this meal it would have been used to refer to anything eaten with bread or that part which would complete a meal or aid in the digestion of the bread and so the word fish is there could be used to mean more than just the fact that they ate a pickled herring or something on the lines but just they had bread and they had meat this was what a meal would consist of and this is what they had and it's a word that's used to refer to what was necessary for a man to sustain life they had they had bread they had meat these were things that were uh necessary for the proper functioning of the body these these were substances the bread with the meat that would be a combination of our carbs and proteins so that they would be able to have a proper functioning of the mind and the order of the body these are things that the scripture is saying was provided and it says in john chapter 6 verse 5 as 5 000 people had gathered when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat and so jesus in the scripture it tells us that jesus asked because he knew what he was going to do but jesus looking upon this multitude that's gathered to hear him speak he's mindful of the fact that the people need to eat and that that uh it wasn't this it wasn't this irrational thought that well if they're here you know listening to me speak then you know that should suffice people don't need to leave and go eat lunch you know what do you you know spiritually immature babies you can't suck it up for six hours and hear me preach he just he knew that this is a need that this is something that the people needed and he asked you philip you know how are we going to get bread and they surmised that philip would have been familiar with the area he might have known a way to procure the bread and he didn't ask this because he was clueless but he knew what he was going to do and he wanted to bring up the subject to the people and the bible tells us that jesus took the loaves and the fish and he distributed five loaves of bread and two fish to his disciples and then the disciples gave it out to the people and as they distributed them and gave them out and as we mentioned before matthew 14 they fed over 5 000 men not counting the children and when they were done feeding thousands of people the disciples each one took a basket and filled 12 different baskets full of leftovers and so each disciple you know when it all started none of them had anything just a boy carrying two uh barley loaves and two or five barley loaves and two fish and now each disciple would have had a bag for themselves of fragments that they took up and that's what has just happened in the day before as we read and it says and uh and the day following so what was before was this tremendous miracle and the bible tells us that the disciples set cell and jesus went into the departed into the mountain and so in verses 22 to 24 the people are gathering together at the place of the miracle so where this miracle took place the people are gathering and they're they're coming and said this is where jesus was he took five barley loaves and two fish he fed over 5000 people and when he fed over 5 000 people they had baskets left over and so there's a lot of things that these people were talking about a lot of things that had taken place and so they all gathered together at the place of the miracle and not finding him there they're like well where is where is jesus and where are the disciples and where is everybody and they noticed and they came to the conclusion oh they must have left and gone across the sea so many crossed the lake to find jesus and again this is because he just took two loaves of bread and two little dried pickled fish and fed over 5000 people and then had enough leftovers for 12 baskets and then so then in verse 25 it says and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when when cameth thou hither they might have not we know the disciples left we saw you going to the mountain how did you come over here and this could have been a wonderful opportunity for jesus for jesus to say i walked here and then i said well uh regardless of how you got here that's a miracle if you walked around you walked across that's a miracle but he says this verily verily i say unto you in verse 26 i say to you ye seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled now this statement is very tremendous because they saw the miracle they participated in the miracle they if you even think of how jesus took the bread and took the fish distribute it to his disciples and then distribute it to the people the disciples would have been giving out this with consciousness thinking well you have enough bread and here's fish and they would have given this to the people in such a way to where there would not have been this expectation of leftovers or any kind of excess so whether it multiplied by the hand of jesus or by the disciples it may have very well multiplied by the people's own hand to where they had left over so they participated in this they ate the bread they ate the fish they might have even seen what jesus gave them never run out as they partook of it so it wasn't that they didn't act they didn't see what jesus had done but he's touching on something the impact of the supernatural and even as you read when he multiplies all this they say truly you are they confess that he was that prophet in other words surely you are the prophet that moses spoke about in deuteronomy 18 that should come so it wasn't that they completely missed the miracle it wasn't that they completely missed the supernatural but the impact of it wasn't deep enough because they ate of the miracle they even associated the one doing the miracle with this prophecy in deuteronomy 18 but the miracles went no deeper than satisfying their appetite and fleshly need for bread this little part is very important for us to catch and just maybe try to personally relate to it it they participated they enjoyed it but it only went so far as the hunger that they would have in their belly in the need that they would have as humans to eat and it could be said that everyone would be willing to partake or receive temporal good from god just as much as every single one of you i don't care how conservative you are and how much you're against big government you all accepted that stimulus check right if you're willing to take it take it from the hand of uncle sam uh we would all even if you didn't even believe in god but somehow you found out he's going to be giving away an escalade you'd get in line because we're all willing to partake in some temporal good from god but jesus called out this error in their heart that everyone's happy with the free meal but do you really catch what's happening do you really see what's taking place and what what was transpiring in their heart and this is really at the the the center of what i'm wanting to lay out here in the beginning the foundation they had a greater respect for their own interest their own personal interests their own carnal appetites than they did about their own their spiritual reality or the spirituality that was taking place a miracle was performed they were able to eat we have nothing to eat what are we doing there's or we've got to bring bread and we're going to get hot and we're going to get hungry and then they eat this miracle and this man must be that prophet spoken of in deuteronomy 18. so jesus says you've showed up for another meeting not because you're recognizing how significant deuteronomy 18 is and not because you really fully understand what the messiah is supposed to do but you're only looking to what benefit you can get from deuteronomy 18 and from jesus in the flesh how it can benefit you in the flesh and so they regarded their own hunger and respected their hunger their natural hunger more than the word and the word that was being preached that would provide for their spiritual appetite they regarded the miracle and the benefit of the miracle upon their body more than they regarded the word that was being preached and what it could do for them in terms of eternal benefits and so jesus says it you did not seek me because you understood and comprehended the depth and the impact of the miracles your eyes were not opened by the miracle but you've sought me because you ate loaves and were satisfied they sought them because they ate bread and fish and their hunger was met their need for food was met and they were full the natural hunger pains that one would have the need to eat a meal that had been satisfied and so their motivation for seeking jesus and crossing the lake was connected to a great and deep need that's within all of us i it's very easy for me i don't have to try to pretend to have discernment and say i feel like someone has back pain and just know that the chances are some of one of you has got back pain like oh my goodness he's got a gift of discernment i i you know you don't have to play around with we all know what it's like to be hungry as a matter of fact i believe my children are perpetually starving there's something about when mom leaves that just triggers this they're famished as soon as she's gone she's they're famous they need to eat but we all this this this their motivation for seeking jesus is connected with a natural appetite a natural hunger that all of us experience that all of us feel and it's not you know it's not a hankering you know for seafood it's not a craving for for indian food it's not just you know some specific thing that just really uh catches your palate just right but it's just the natural need for meat the natural desire for bread or substance to live we have the luxury of saying where do you want to eat and what do we always say anywhere's fine okay let's go there well anywhere's fine means not there and we have we we can choose so many different places to go and we can or do you want this kind of food you want that kind of food and you can partake and eat so many different things and so we say i am hungry and so then the next question is where do you want to eat and you're not hungry in the sense that you have to eat to live you're hungry in the sense that i want something that kind of hits that spot i'm looking for a particular thing to satisfy a craving that's really not the hunger i'm talking about that's the first world problems that we have where we know we need to eat so let's eat somewhere luxurious and some place that we can enjoy someplace we really like but when i talk about a hunger or a desire within someone's heart we're just talking about the need that the body has to have substance to live the base need the basic need that we all have to eat bread and in that in that vein the idea that there was a man who could multiply bread and multiply meat was a very powerful attraction could you imagine if uh if you're if the pastor that you had could just somehow multiply stimulus checks right we all got teslas you know just just rolled off the pastor's hand that would be a very very powerful attraction like well i know where i'm going to church tesla tabernacle right you know we pay our tithes in bitcoin there and and they would just been a natural it'd be it'd be a very very powerful attraction it's like well we we need transportation or we need money to live and if you had a ministry that could just multiply that from nothing that would be a very very powerful draw and so that we really understand even more more significantly what a draw that would have been it wouldn't have been this uh something seemingly lustful but this was a man who took two loaves of bread or five loaves of bread and two fish and fed over 5000 people and you're thinking i work to feed my family i labor i i i make provision and i'm contemplating and we're always thinking about famine and we're always worried about this and if there's a man that could feed over 5 000 people then this is somebody saying now this is something significant this is something from the hand of god this is the messiah it was a very very big attraction to them because it was a solution to a great fear how are we going to eat it was a very it was a solution to a never ending labor of mankind why did man work why did man labor so that he could have bread to feed himself and to feed his family and to think that there could be endless bread to live it's almost as if existence as they knew it would completely change to know that bread would be provided for i'm only working and laboring to make sure that we have bread upon our table if i know that bread is going to be on our table think about the resources that are freed up think about how much life is going to change because now there's one that can take just these few elements and feed us you're catching how powerful of an attraction that would have been and so this is this is this and this need to work to labor for bread it goes all the way back to the beginning in genesis 3 when the curse was upon the earth and god told adam that in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread till thou return unto the ground and it this you're kind of the simplest way to describe the essential need of man he's got to eat to live in the endless cycle how he's working to produce bread to eat to live and the inevitable end how even though he's labored to eat bread he ultimately is going to die so this is the reality in existence in the most basic simple way that we could describe it over 5 000 men upon a mountaintop they need to eat they're hungry and all of a sudden miraculously every belly is full and there's leftovers and it goes all the way back to the falls like god told adam he would have to work every day and by the sweat of his brow eat bread and then perpetuate this cycle day after day until the body dies and now we're getting bread from the hand of god as it were this is a it's it's speaking to this desire and this need within mankind whereas jesus in matthew chapter 6 he's telling him don't take any thought don't be anxious about what you'll eat or what you shall drink or yet for your body what you shall put on so this was something that people think about this is something people worry about now and i'm not wanting just to kind of point back and say yeah you know those people back in those days those were real vintage people they had to worry about what they were going to eat and what they were going to drink and what they were going to wear we have the same needs now we have some of the similar pursuits and the truth is a lot of us we do we are we are very comfortable in our ability to acquire food the our ability to pay our rent or our mortgage and our ability to be clothed with with nice clothes and there's people that we fellowship and those who are part of the household of faith who struggle to make sure that they're even going to get their rent paid wonder just exactly where how far food is going to go and it's very important that we not get so comfortable in how we have all these things that reach and forget that jesus and the scripture identify this as a real anxiety among people because not everyone typically usually you're not going to find even in the in the faithful and those that serve god opulence and riches and extravagance and the ability just to grab and eat whatever they want there has to be discipline there has to be budgeting there can be some very difficult times we're not sure sure how far this is going to go and and where's the next meal going to come if this doesn't come through we don't get that job or if this happens or that happens and jesus is touching on the great fear and anxiety of every man what am i going to eat what am i going to drink how i'm going to clothe my body but he says is not the life more than meat in the body than reignment now we ask it rhetorically and that we probably say well yeah it is yeah the body's more than uh you know life is more than just eating and the body is more than for clothing but if we if we if we didn't have clothing and food we kind of what are we doing here right like it's the most basic need that's the sum of man's most basic needs it's the sum of man's greatest concerns and so the physical need for just basic human survival so that we could have health and we could even reproduce and have proper bodily functions it's met in food and water in rest and shelter and clothing these are just like the basic things so that you can feel human the basic things that we would need the basic things that we would have to have on a daily basis to be able to achieve all the other things we want to do uh i remember one time i was in honduras with brother paul lafontaine and we're getting ready to leave the hotel and i can't remember the arc of the conversation but it kind of implying do you have everything you need are you ready to preach and i i'm just wanting to convey that as long as as long as i have you know i have my my tie on and my bible i know the gift god will use the gift and i can preach and i made the comment i said as long as i've got clothes on in my bible i'm good to go and he's like is the closed part a problem sometimes you know do you sometimes forget to get dressed when you go preach but really in that way if if if i can dress if i can put clothes on if i can have a meal and then i i've take taken those necessary steps to have those most basic needs met to in order to go forth and do whatever it else is i need to do in the day so these are just on the base basic needs of the human being and so when we look at hunger hunger is just relates to food or just the substance it's even the word that's used for hunger is not just our craving or appetite for something in particular that i don't want that no i don't want that but it actually is unease or pain because of the lack of food to be hungry it's a strong eager desire for survival a desire to maintain essential functions it's a craving wherein the body needs something because it knows if it doesn't have that it cannot even exist not it's not i'm not talking about oh that hit the spot i'm talking about that that keeps me alive type thing that's what we mean by hunger and there's really no plan or pursuit that we engage in that doesn't account for or work around our need to eat if you're going on if you're going to go on a hike have water and if how depending on how long it's going to be you might want to have something to snack on you might want to have something to eat every every trip every every vacation don't we all plan our vacations around where we're going to eat right like where might eat breakfast where am i lunch it's like where are you going i'm going there oh what what are you going to see well i've got all these restaurants picked out and whatever's between them that's what i'm gonna see and that's how we plan things when we we have these first world problems but if you think about it just anything if eating's not really that big to you you make contingencies or plans to have something for what so you can stay focused so your body could have the proper nutrients in order to continue to engage in whatever endeavor it is every plan every pursuit ought to account for a workaround the body's need to eat if not it's probably a failure or if not what do we call it fasting for the entire thing is built around the fact that we're not eating so our whole lives are going to be built around this condition i need to provide for eating or i'm not eating and still it has a way of coloring and framing our entire lives and this need this this need to eat and the power of its feeling which hunger is so great that being deprived of food and water is one of the worst ways to die in exodus chapter 16 and the children of israel said unto them verse 3 exodus 16 verse 3 would to god we would had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger in other words we would have rather died by some means in egypt with full bellies as slaves than to be free men in the desert and die because of hunger this is just how men this is how big and i'm not chiding the israelites and saying oh they're crazy no this is just how significant it is for someone to be hungry and think that they're going to die and their children are going to die because they don't have bread and they don't have water and they're going to be dehydrated they're going to die of starvation and these bodily functions that begin to shut down they're thinking it would be better if we died by some other tragic event as slaves in full bellies than to be out here in the wilderness and die this agonizing death of malnutrition starvation and dehydration in lamentations 4 9 the bible says they that be slain with the sword are better lamentations four verse nine they that are killed or slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger the bible is saying to be better to be murdered and better to have your life taken away in a tragedy or bleeding out than to die with hunger for these pieing away stricken through want of the fruits of the field so this is within our dna as human beings this is part of our thought process and our psyche these things are rooted in our evolution how that we must eat to live we must eat to live we must do this for survival and it's and it would be the most horrible death to die being stricken with hunger and withering away for want of the fruits of the field it would be better to die a slave with the full belly than to die a free man of starvation this is what the bible is expressing so when they have said when he says you sought me not because you really are catching something deep and spiritual but you sought me really because i was able to feed you and that forms a very large significant thing with even your unconsciousness that your body needs bread so badly that that was enough to get you attracted that essential most basic need to survive was enough for someone to say i'll cross a lake i got a fear of water but i'll cross the lake for a guy who can feed me i'm willing and really what would the shame be you know hanging out in that crew right i mean that would be a posse that we wouldn't be ashamed of like this guy here you got some bread watch this right i mean we would say what you want about the guy we're all eating well right so there really is not much shame in somebody being able to put food on your table by ways of miracles so there's a lot of things a lot of stigmas and a lot of shame and a lot of reproach that would be completely gone when you have somebody who can give you what you need to live and survive and have essential functions so jesus then says this in verse 27 john 6 27 labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth under everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed jesus turns the entire pursuit upside down he turns the very hierarchy of needs he completely demolishes it not even turns it upside down he basically does away with it to say look you labor on the most basic fundamental level to make sure that your bodily functions are are running properly and orderly so that you can do all these other things that you would need to do because if you haven't had if you haven't had a good breakfast and you're not thinking clearly your blood sugar's low you're probably not gonna be able to put together your puzzle or run around the block or do all these other things you need to do manage life take care of the kids teach whatever it might be you realize there's certain basic human needs that have to be taken care of so this is how man was orienting himself for thousands of years and they're thinking this is what jesus gets because he was worried about whether or not we had eaten that day this is what everyone gets they get it that a man's got to eat and all of a sudden jesus says you know what don't labor for that and he turns the entire pursuit upside down he's saying what do you mean that's all that we labor for if we knew we were going to get handouts if we knew that we had a uh you know minimum basic income and we knew that we would have food delivered us by hello fresh every day i would be able to do hobbies not have a job right and they're thinking oh this this doesn't make it this is completely different he turns it completely upside down by saying don't strive and labor for meat that perishes but labor and strive for meat which endureth under everlasting life and he basically says you can work real hard for food that's perishable or you can labor for something of eternal substance in other words what is going to become the leading object of your life because he's not saying just in case i'm not i'm making a mess of this jesus is not telling him don't work for food right you can keep your will work for food signs but he's saying what's your chief anxiety what what is what is it you're trying to accomplish what's your overall objective do do we would we seek a religion or a belief system or would we try to pursue some lifestyle that really ultimately just benefits us in the natural and in the flesh you're going to try to put everything all the pieces into its place to achieve some sort of nirvana in this natural life or is there something more to it i mean there's it because there's it's not listen the word of god it has never been intended to be you know 12 steps to having a better day or or a band-aid on man's problems it's something entirely different than anything that exists anywhere else the true word of god and what's being presented to us through the word of god and the opening of scripture is not just another religion another belief system another way to order our lives and submit to it and make this work uh and just life feel a little bit easier brother matthew it's not another crossfit cult that's not we're trying to do just we all agree on certain things we're all going to work out together and we're all going to try to you know what's your bmi now and what are you eating like what protein yeah you know i found these pills you know we're just all part of this thing no this is so much deeper than any diet any exercise any belief system any religion this is something that jesus is saying that every other religion is going to try to find some way to better your lives through natural means because that's all that it is he says now i'm telling you don't labor for meat that perishes and don't look for just a government of natural things but labor for meat which endures to everlasting life which the son of man alone can give you what's your chief anxiety what's your main leading objective are you only worried about making sure this works and that works and this works and that works or are you wanting to at the end of the day find what really matters we know that food is required for strength food is required for life without fundamental health without soundness of mind and body the rest really has no meaning or purpose right what if we just even think logically if if if all of us didn't have a snickers this morning we'd all be here you know grumpy brother michael's up here give me the key of g happy happy happy happiness i i'm running us down i mean we just won't kind of be grumpy like you know what i mean if you're not gonna if your body's not gonna be where it needs to be if your blood sugar is not where it needs to be if you're if you're in pain right nothing feels good so there's this obvious need for the body to be aligned there's an obvious need to eat and have health because without it you know just can you work properly can you enjoy other things properly these things are necessary but i'm asking the question today hungry but not to leave here and go eat somewhere but the questions being asked to probe your heart are you at rest that even when your belly is full and you're finding all the choice places to to eat and you're able to buy the choice pieces of meat and you're able to get them smoked just right you're able to grill it just right where your wife's an excellent cook or baker and all these things and you find that i've got i can hike and i can eat and i and i'm able to do this and all these things can be done but yet still at the end of the day you're still hungry you're still not satisfied and jesus is trying to get them to recognize this say now what just happened is very powerful and has a very very strong draw upon the body for great for understandable reasons and for right reasons if you knew that there was somebody that could heal your body and you'd be sick your entire life there's no i i wouldn't want to weaponize that person's desire to be delivered from a debilitating illness like oh well my goodness gracious you saw jesus christ and all you got was healed that is such a huge thing in a person's life they're unable they can't think right they can't function properly can't be the wife they want to be they can't be the mother they want to be a man can't work like he should and the desire and the longing to be healed in their body that's not a nasty perverted desire that's a natural desire and it's a need that god can meet it's a need that this word can fulfill but there's something deeper than that and these powers and these motivations of our base human needs to in satisfying them pursue them don't always bring the fulfillment or the contentment so jesus continues or after he says this to him you should labor for meat which is internal they said unto him in verse 28 what shall we do that we might work the works of god now it might sound as if the the question is being changed a little bit or they're trying to change the subject but what can we do so that we can do the miracles like you're doing what can we do to really perform these wonderful things and i'll speculate that maybe they're thinking well jesus won't do it all the time maybe we can multiply loaves and fish and they said so he says jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent i'm sure that didn't really it didn't do much for them they're kind of like okay all right uh how does that how does that equal bread how does that equal fish so he says what what must you do this is the work this is what you must do believe on him whom he had sent they said therefore to him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe in other words you said that we didn't see the miracle but yet we saw you multiply the bread we saw you do this by the hand of god give us another sign that may open our eyes and then we'll believe upon him whom you say he has sent believe upon the son of man that has been sent that is this bread who can give us this bread that tends to everlasting life what doest thou work our now this is their saying our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat so when asking for further vindication they point back to the exodus wherein god answered the children of israel's hunger they said why did you bring us out to the desert to die of hunger to die of starvation we'd be better to die as slaves with bellies full in egypt by some calamity than to die of starvation in the wilderness and god answered their hunger and he and he uh and he gave them bread they're saying when we were in egypt when we were leaving egypt and we were in the exodus god through the hand of moses our fathers did eat manna as he gave them bread from heaven to eat they bring it back to the natural hunger that was satisfied in the exodus and the fact that moses met their natural hunger when they complained about it like we're in this exodus we're seeing the mighty hand of god and when we complained about our bellies not being full we received manna and the bible says in nehemiah and god gave us them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought us forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst nehemiah 9 15. in deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 3 says and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know now notice this they were hungry in the flesh right and god gave them fleshly food and it's just as the bible says if someone says they're cold and you say oh be warm i'm hungry we'll be thou filled that's that that yeah that's not making that that doesn't work right will yourself warm will yourself full like if somebody's hungry then what you want is you want they would want food to fill their belly if somebody's cold they want some source of heat or warmth in order to remedy that need and this is exactly god didn't look at the children of his like oh we're dying of hungry he's like well imagine yourselves full you know what you believed this far believe that you can survive in the wilderness without food no god gave them bread to meet that need but he did it that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live like there's still was something behind this thing you can't just take this as the end all that as long as we have food that this is this is the this is the desire of god to make sure that we're well fed and well clothed that there was something more greater need that existed within mankind that's only going to be satisfied through the word i did this so that at the end of the day man would be sick there would be some signal to man to believe in a god so supernatural and to take him at his word because ultimately man cannot just live by the meat that energizes his flesh but he's going to be asked to live and he can only be fully satisfied by living by the word that comes out of god's mouth so in matthew chapter 4 when jesus was led of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted says he went and fasted 40 days and 40 nights and he afterward hungered painful desire very very hungry and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread now listen you don't ever have to clown for the devil if thou be if thou be i think sometimes it's the this this the the voice of the critics that we imagine that motivate us to act more than the voice of god that tells us to stand still oh well what would they say and what would they think and we're we're acting on these imaginary voices sometimes they're real but sometimes they're imaginary and we've just constructed a jeering audience well if you do that we're going to make fun of you well i better not do that but you better do this well then i think i'll do that and we're just imagining it in other words we should just we should just live by what god would have us to do if thou be if thou be the taunts and the intimidations and the bullying of the devil listen i i we shouldn't be moved by that god will provide god will god will do the things that are necessary jehovah sees and he'll see to it and and and so he says if thou be the son of god well basically if he's asking this supposition well if thou be then do this for jesus to even begin to try to answer that or do it is validating the question on whether or not he is oh well let me prove a teacher just didn't need to prove anything to the devil but he says he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but every but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god what are these scriptures emphasizing even the very fact the very thing that the these men they had gone across the lake and to capernaum the very ones that came and and started this conversation with jesus how did you get here and you just came because you want more bread they're kind of like oh well you know if we do well then what should what can we do to work the works of god well just believe on him and we said well you know when we were hungry in the wilderness god gave us bread from heaven and we were satisfied they bring it right back to that in the very thing that they identified god's basis and reason for it was so that they wouldn't get so fixated on the natural things but they would recognize this is something beyond natural and if a god can reign quail down out of heaven and a god could multiply bread every morning such that whatever we wanted to taste we'd taste it to the children it was oil to one it would be fish to another it would be that they all the honeycomb it would be whatever they wanted if god could do that then how much more should we believe for things that are beyond this like why would we relegate everything to just these natural realms and pull everything down to where that's that's the limit of it god says i did it so that you would know that you can live by and find true meaning in the word of god and jesus brings it right back to that when he's hungry and the devil wants him to turn stones into bread he's like well i could do that and satisfy the body but i have a greater motivator there's a higher pursuit bread alone is not the ultimate goal it's not by any means necessary we fill the belly right that that's not how we're living to where we justify certain things like well it's a means to an end at the end of the day if we can just we need to eat right so i mean why do you care if i walked out with an extra bag of alright of french fries without paying for them i mean if they didn't want this they wouldn't have self-checkout duh right and we somehow rationalize it because i'm meeting a base it's not like i'm trying to sell it on ebay and get rich but this has got to be a dif there's got to be something a different motivator different kind of integrity something else that's guiding you and jesus said hey i'm not just all about where am i going to get my next meal am i just all about whether or not my belly's full there's something greater a greater need and a greater desire above that and something else that i'm tapped into i'm feeding on that satisfying me and this is the real secret to contentment because hunger is so powerful that it actually drives man away from things that are most essential and things that are the most fulfilling thinking that well if i'm not i hate this feeling of being hungry i hate this feeling of being broken as long as i can just fix all these things in the mind and body fix all these things in the natural then everything will be fixed and everything will click and fall in its place but the proverb says in proverbs 30 verse 8 remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches it's a plea for contentment remove far from me vanity remove from me lies removed from me i don't want poverty nor riches i just want contentment feed me with food convenient for me just give me prey as my allowance of bread for that day give me my daily bread give me my sufficient portion for each day just make sure that this base need is met i don't want to be greedy for gain i don't want it to be extravagant i don't need to be well or arrayed and things don't need to be luxurious and fine and supple and wonderful and i don't need some sort of status meal and i don't need some status clothing i just want what's convenient for me feed me with what's convenient for me i mean that's like a real healthy way to approach eating i live for years with the principle i live to eat in other words that's all that's the only reason why i was living i was living to eat so if you live to eat then when you eat you want to eat well right you know it's got to have so many ratings on yelp and it's got to have so many ratings on google and you've got to make sure you've looked this up and looked that up and it's got to have the right things it's got to have the right and you want to make sure you're eating well and eating right if you're living to eat you're probably going to die quicker right then if you're just hey i got to eat to live so i'm going to eat and i'm going to eat this there's some nutritional advice i could dish out right now not necessarily but i charge for that so i'm a professional but it's a little bit more healthy so you know what i need to eat to sustain function right and this need that that's kind of the just give me the bread that's convenient for me but it's still even in that desire it's acknowledging the fact that there can be such a need natural need that drives a man too far that'll cause a man to lose even his moral compass and the people in john 6 are unknowingly wrestling with how their hunger has hijacked their minds they're not they don't really they're not really catching it but jesus is basically wanting them to say look you're men or you're human so you need to eat and you realize you can't live without eating but that whole dynamic has become so large in your mind that you're looking that the very fact that god took natural bread this doesn't happen naturally he took barley loaves and took fish and multiplied them and had leftovers and you still are thinking cha-ching we can really eat like this is awesome our belly's gonna be full like it never dawned on you that whoa wait a minute what's going on here this is beyond i'm not thinking about lunch anymore i've lost my appetite i i i there's something else happening here i don't know what's going on but this is way beyond what we're eating for lunch but they're natural this thing is so great and so powerful it hijacked the thought process in proverbs chapter 28 verse 21 to have respects of person is not good for for a piece of bread that man will transgress do you catch that we have respect of persons and you hold someone in high esteem there's a way that this dynamic of politics can work upon a person or if you favor somebody you're trying to gain favor win favor you want to you want to have some influence or you want to benefit by that relationship it can actually the fact that a man hungers and he has certain basic needs it'll cause him to transgress the bible's identifying a weakness in man that natural hunger can motivate bad behavior because he realizes if i fall out of political favor then i may not be able to make a living or may not get the rays and may not be able to provide and these things begin to work upon a person where now there's forces that are motivating somebody and the bible says that you will because of hunger and the natural needs and your base needs as a human transgress why it's a powerful force in proverbs chapter 6 verse 30 men do not despise it says men do not despise a thief now this is really heavy it's human nature to not despise or begrudge a thief if he's still to satisfy his soul when he is hungry in other words we can even all of us could relate to the the one who's a beggar the one that's stricken the one that's needy who doesn't know how they're gonna feed their kids and they go into a grocery store and they're trying to steal diapers or they're trying to steal formula and that happens and we look at that and we're like well you know what they were desperate and it's really hard to begrudge them and it's really we can have some empathy or maybe sympathy who can empathize maybe at least some sympathy realize hey the extremes that people go to to provide for their kids all because this need and this hunger the bible's even saying that we won't despise a man who steals because he's so hungry he needs to eat to live so it acknowledges on one hand we get it we know how strong this drive is and it's so strong that we're even willing to justify theft when it's to satisfy a hungry soul right in the body a body that is hungry in genesis chapter 25 i'm just wanting to identify right now how being hungry and this natural desire can change our thinking and cause us to really miss what god is doing and what he's trying to accomplish in genesis chapter 25 esau is out hunting and he comes back and he is hungry faint he is famished and i don't know if esau was a drama queen or if he really really was just that hungry but he said oh i'm going to die oh jacob make me make me something to eat i'm going to die and he's and the bible he tells a story he sold his birthright he sold his rights as the firstborn because he was faint with hunger and this is how powerful hunger is he says in genesis chapter 25 32 and esau said behold i am at the point to die what prophet shall this birthright do to me this is how powerful hunger is that he rationalizes and says well if i can't live then what good is it to be the firstborn what is the double portion going to be what is what is this right going to be what is that going to be and in his hunger he completely forsake really maybe what would have been any kind of rational thought like do you really think you're going to die because you've been out hunting all morning like how long have you been gone and maybe i i might be a little flippant maybe he'd been gone for three weeks trying to hunt i don't know but it's there's it's it the question is how could you get so hungry in a moment that you'd be willing to exchange everything associated with being the firstborn for pottage for meat but yet here he was disregarding the spiritual advantages of the birthright it's where there should have been some honor there should have been some worth enough to say that it's not even willing to be exchanged like this is the value of the birthright i have all these rights and privileges as being the firstborn and it's so valuable that it wouldn't even be worth exchanging to live i would rather die holding that right and holding that privilege and holding to that honor and esteeming and even thinking that perhaps providence would step in on my behalf as the one that would be heir to the priesthood heir to the double portion that if i providence had seen that i would be the firstborn then could not providence then uphold me in this moment and maintain my integrity and not sell it just for a mess of pottage but he didn't regard and respect just as these men before jesus did not respect the spiritual advantages that were being offered to him he did not regard the spiritual benefits of the birthright and hunger is what made him vulnerable in the bible in hebrews chapter 12 verse 16 it says lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau not that he was a fornicator although there is some jewish uh segments of the jewish tradition that believe that all in the same day esau committed five different evil acts of murder and fornication but here it seems to be saying that he is a profane person who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright profanely cast away spiritual privilege for what for a meal he cast away now to kind of get your mind around it it was he was throwing away his inheritance not just his but his children everything he stood to gain i mean all the all the legacy and everything that was in the will and all the estate and all the double portion i mean he basically said i'm so hungry and jacob the shyster he says well i tell you what let me have your birth right capitalizing that vulnerability capitalizing on one's need to eat and one's need to have a meal to sustain life and he capitalizes on on esau's vulnerability and he's his mind is so hijacked by hungry he's like well if i die what good's the birthright you can have it and just in that profaning in him not saying wait a minute are you kidding me i'd rather die than give that up and if i die you'll get it anyway so i'm just holding fast i'm holding to it and i'm not going to give it away i'm just going to trust god that something's going to happen but he gave it away all because he was hungry hunger it comes from the root to toil for daily substance the word hunger has the idea of a pinching toil there's a pining it means to crave ardently if you're hungry you suffer for want you're needy you seek it's something you have an eager desire for to be hungry there's some sort of pain caused by the lack of food and it's this primal base need that motivates and drives our flesh it's what's inspires survival instincts whether you've ever thought about it or not it's this that's at the root of all our labor as men and women and there before jesus in john chapter 6 they say well our fathers hate man in the wilderness that came down from heaven and jesus says in verse 32 john 6 32 verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven and he's not rejecting that mo that bread came down about of heaven but he's saying that bread did not come by the hand of moses moses didn't give you that bread from him he didn't give you the bread you're alluding to or the bread i'm alluding to and even the bread that moses gave didn't come from heaven as it were and it didn't come from moses it came from god it came from the atmosphere it fell down but i and jesus is trying to kind of create this division now no no wait a minute that was just a type moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven in other words moses did not pray for prepare and procure the bread that you ate in the wilderness god gave that bread but that bread was not the true bread that bread was just a type that bread was from god and it was for your flesh i'm not talking about a bread that feeds the flesh he's like hello that's exactly what the disciples did when jesus always says hey beware of the leaven of the scribes and pharisees he's like hey where's the bread what happened to the they're trying to poison us and they were just thinking about natural bread they wasn't they didn't connect it to something is he saying this because we don't have bread what's gotten in here is jesus is he on gluten-free now what's happening and it's still this mindset and this attitude of not catching it and he's wanting to identify this that's bread for flesh anybody can participate in that but i'm talking about god gives true bread from heaven and he's pointing to a different bread he's actually trying to identify a different and greater hunger we're just conscious of this body's need for bread because of hunger pains because we recognize the detriments and not eating we realize the struggle and the toil and the histories of famines and people dying and they have histories of famines where thousands of people are dying every day in rome 5 000 a day during these great famines these things were these famines were things that happened often during this time period this is something large this is something very substantial this is something they think about and jesus actually say as much as you think bread and meat is in water is important i got something that's even more important than that and everyone would be like jacob or esau or like those in the wilderness oh if we can't eat what good is all this other stuff you're going to do for me if i if i can't have my belly full how am i going to enjoy whatever else you've got going on jesus then brings it right back to the exit or actually brings it before the exodus he brings it before the fall and he strikes at a need that is greater than food verse 33 for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life into the world imagine just how contradictory this was to their natural inclinations imagine just how contradictory this was to the religious inclinations when he says this the bread of god which he the for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world he's saying there is a living bread of life that is more essential than your daily food there's a living bread of life that's more essential than daily water this is something that is greater than all these things and he's wanting to identify wanting to awaken and quicken inside of them that they have a need that's so deep within them that it transcends the need for natural food and natural water like let's go back before the exodus let's go back before the fall let's go back to how what god made man for in the very beginning and how he would have lived and what he would have been focused around and god did not make man so that he would be an animal that just hunts his next meal but he put something deep down within people where there would be something greater than the natural food something greater than the water of this world then that alone would satisfy no matter how well you eat how well you dress how well you work how much you weigh how physically fit you are how perfectly your hair lays you wouldn't matter all of that you'd still feel empty unless that other part is touched i i believe that god is addressing some very specific things that maybe some of us just simply need to be reminded that unless that's being satisfied the rest is never going to bring you happiness it's never going to work for you and and if you if you're somewhat resistant to it thank god for it it's his grace if you can't be satisfied with enough money in the bank you can't be satisfied with good e you can't be satisfied with a nice house that's paid off you can't be satisfied with the car you can't be satisfied with athletic accomplishments none of these things satisfy and you still feel empty today don't despair thank god for his grace that he's never let anything hush that hunger for him be glad that you never found the thing well crack did it for me i'm satisfied be glad be glad that nothing else is satisfied that's his grace and when he says that verse 34 then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread and this seems to be an instinctive sincere reply this seems to be very heartfelt like well then give us the spread but it still carries the idea of bread for flesh because i and i'm so glad that i took the scriptures and i didn't have them in my notes because i wanted to go through these other scriptures to where the jews believed that the messiah would come and he would give him the best wine the best oil the best spices and the best bread i mean this would be the uber uber eats i mean this was this would be uh much better than what we could get today because that's what they expected the messiah is going to come they're going to be restored back to a garden of eden and all the heathen nations like do you see what they're eating like that's like the best olive oil you can get is that avocado toast what these guys are killing it and it says they'll feed and they'll be fed and they'll be clothed and they'll be happy but everyone else my servants will eat well and they'll rejoice and they'll have their tables full they believed that the messiah was going to come and it was just going to be a smorgasbord of good eats and that's what they thought in their mind like what else would a man want to do other than eat well can i get a witness yes that's what we want to do we want to eat well and that's how they thought like if i can eat good then i'm good and they said if you be the messiah then give us this perpetual food that'll quench our hunger and that's what they're asking for then if this is it then we believe in the scriptures according to the scripture that he's going to come and we're going to eat well we're ready for it we'll receive it but their their their response lord evermore give us this bread at least they're now desirous for whatever he has and in john chapter 4 i'm going to ask this to you individually so feel free to respond anybody getting restless i'm over an hour i get it but um i'm just going slow today don't you love it when the preacher says we're just going to do a sunday school lesson today don't we all just cringe when that happens like oh great this isn't a sunday school lesson because it's gone way beyond our time limit but you're doing so well and pulling and listening i have such a great liberty just to continue in john chapter 4 i want to go through the story of the woman at the well verse three i'm going to read to verse 34 we'll just try to jump through this very quickly he left jude and departed again into galilee and he must needs go through samaria he had he needed to go through some area not for lunch not because it was a good detour because this one had been on diners drive-ins and dives and it's only an hour out of the way and it's going to be worth it so we got to go to samaria to eat at that new pizza joint then cometh heat of the city of samaria which is called cycle near the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph now jacob's well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour there cometh the woman of samaria to draw water so jesus is weary he's tired he's resting on the well now comes a woman with her pot to draw water why she needs it her house needs it this is something you do naturally jesus said to her give me to drink then it gives us like a little bit of background for his disciples or gone away under the city to that new pizza place that had five stars the guy fieri had been to so they're going into the city they go to the city to buy meat why it's we need to eat we need to have water we need to eat this is the need we must do these things this is all part of this story these natural thirsts for water the natural need for meat so jesus says give me to drink then save the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew asked drink of me which i'm a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans so she's thinking very strictly that i'm a samaritan come to draw water you're a jew asking for me to draw water for you we don't talk like to each other you don't ask me for water i don't ask you for water i don't give you water you don't give me water this is how we roll and then in verse 10 jesus answered and said unto her and again this is where just as jesus turned it on him before in john chapter six he's doing the same thing here they're all about that bread and he's like oh don't labor for that labor for the eternal the things that are eternal like wait a minute wait i don't need to worry about those things if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would us have asked of him and he would have given thee living water in other words if you fully knew who was standing before you and you weren't just caught up in the scene of a weary man at a well who you would assume needs water and a woman who's coming to the well with a pot and all these things seem to be aligning that the natural thing would be that hey let's just get our water and go he said if you really knew who this weary man was laying up against this well and why he had need to come to samaria this story would get cut short and you'd say give me this living water if you really knew and the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water well living water to her just meant good water right this is substance this is what we all need this is something we have to live by water is what will help us have crops and water is what it helps us drink and water helps us do that and water helps us do that so she's still in her mind just thinking well if you can give me water you're going to need something to draw with and this is a deep well and at this point i don't see anything you can use to give me this water are you greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank there of himself and his children and his cattle well as a matter of fact right it's like one of those haha got you she thinks it's kind of it's like a mic drop moment and she just burned him everything oh man she got him oh my goodness she got him he's like well yeah as a matter of fact i am greater than the guy who dug this well but she's still thinking in terms of natural thirst she's still thinking in terms of the necessities of the flesh i understand the logistics here sir that if you can give me water you need something to draw with and at this point i got a pot you don't i win so who who needs who and jesus anson said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again here he is he's weary is that the well he said think about it ma'am if you drink this water you come here today at the sixth hour to draw water guess where you're going to be tomorrow right back here six o'clock with the same pot empty again to get water because if you're only chasing this thirst it's a cycle you always end up empty he says but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him should never thirst doesn't say you won't want more he says you'll never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life that if you take of this fountain everything changes that though you would still need to show up at six o'clock at a well with an empty pot to get water for natural life there's something else greater that drives man that would be satisfied who never has to never have to thirst again and let me say this with with a desire to amplify in a greater way let me just say this to challenge maybe some of our belief systems but we can buy into belief systems that place our motivation in a lie if you just do this if you just do that if you just do these things and we take our trust and we put it in certain steps and certain disciplines certain ideas even if we just took the man's hierarchy of needs and well i just kind of i need to have these needs and these needs and these needs and if i could get all these things and we're always buying into some beliefs and some book we read some youtube video we watched or something that we think holds the secret listen christ is the secret these the principles even that we can uh adhere to and the things that we can be disciplined in listen there's things that we there's things that we are told that we should do for our own health and there's things that we ought to do for our own wealth and there's prudent things that we should do in a lot of different other disciplines and i won't say one bad thing about it but let me say if you don't have what's best none of it's good it's christ that's gonna give anything else meaning it's christ it's going to be the force multiplier it's christ going to be the one that even makes it work and maybe that's sometimes what we're forgetting is we have a god that stands near and every time we're like well i'm going to try this he makes it happen because he wants to care for you and then we think we just got some kind we got magic our kid goes to do something and we make it happen for them and they don't realize we made it happen like we're letting them win right right guys you always win jack's clapping like yeah and they think man i i can beat my dad like i'm really really good at this and you know what that's what god does with us all the time we think we're smart enough we think we were good savvy enough we think we figured it out we think we made all the right decisions and god's like no i'm just going to look out after you he says i am john chapter 6 verse 35 i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst if thou knewest the gift of god and he who is standing here you would ask me for living water well you don't have anything to draw with you think you're better than jacob well man as a matter of fact if you got the water i had to give you would never thirst again but you would be a well of living water you would have inside of you everything that you need for contentment everything you need for satisfaction you actually have a source of power deep inside of you that if it was necessary you could make bread if it was necessary you could create water that's how deep this well runs that's how great i am that's how much greater i am than jacob i don't have to dig it i could create it by your own mouth so you drink this water you'll never thirst again i am the bread of life he that come to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst what kind of bread is this think about it what what kind of hunger could this be is this like they have those pills you can take that whatever you taste taste sweet that's not what he's talking about this isn't some kind of gimmick where oh i just take a pill it's an appetite suppressant i'm not hungry during the day well how long you be able to do that right so we know this just is this isn't a magic show this isn't some kind of trick what kind of hunger is he talking about how can the very thing that has framed our human existence from genesis chapter 3 all of a sudden change our days are defined by breakfast lunch and dinner and the snack before we go to bed hey this is this is so what are you you small meals frequently no i'm three meals a day no i do one big one we're all identified but what we are what we eat i i'm all fats and no i'm all carbs and i'm i'm this and i'm that i mean how could you take something that has literally framed human existence driven societies been the very the very thing is at the forefront of fallen man's condition and you're going to change all that in a moment but he's saying that there's a bread of life that satisfies the deepest pains and hungers of pains of hunger and thirst of the broken man that's what he's saying there's something deeper you think you could have bread the rest of your life and you'll die happy no because you weren't made for that so the woman saith unto him when she says he says if you drink this water verse 15 the woman said to him sir give me this water that i don't thirst for neither that i came to draw but i want it just like what they said in john chapter 6 lord evermore give us this bread and she says in a way that well i don't really i'm not really thirsty for it uh and i didn't come to draw it but i like what you're saying i mean i'll have it she seems sincere i believe that she was sincere but to be certain that she fully recognizes the need that he's referring to watch what he says jesus saith in her john 4 16 go call thy husband and come hither oh you say you're not hungry i'm gonna show you just how thirsty you've been right think about it oh oh you're not thirsty i'll leave that alone listen to what he had what he's about to say if you can read it here john chapter 4 verse 16. go call thy husband and come hither she just said i'm not thirsty for it i didn't come to draw it but give it to me the woman answered said i have no husband jesus said in her thou has well said i have no husband for thou has had five husbands and the guy you're with now and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that set us thou truly you said you're not thirsty look at your life look at your life young lady parents turned you out as a teenage girl and look you've been hungry ever since you've been trying to satisfy this you thought it could be in that one husband you thought it'd be in the next you thought it'd be in the next you thought it'd be the next you thought it'd be the next and you thought you know what it's not marriage it's just having someone to provide and you've been trying to make sure that you had water and bread through all these different relationships as a young girl and you're with the sixth man five husbands the one you're with now is not your husband and you tell me you're not thirsty come on somebody just to make sure she knew what she was asking for he started peeling it back saying daughter you've been hungry since birth you had unfortunate circumstances being turned out in the streets as a young girl you become a prostitute you've been married five times the one you're with now is not even your husband you've spoke the truth maybe even being a little bit evasive but hunger's caused this your thirst for this waters caused this because what have you been wanting you've been wanting to lay your head down at night happy you've been wanting to have a sense of peace when you get up in the morning you've been wanting able to face the face of society not as an outcast and not as a prostitute you that you can't outrun your past you've got the hauntings of five husbands you've got the estrangement from your family the one you're with now you're only with them now because you know you need bread and you say you're not thirsty for this you're thirsty and then something turns inside of a verse 19 the woman sayeth on him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet she didn't say did you hear my stomach growl there's something deeper now our father's worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship now she's thinking more deeply because perception is not a function of her belly perception something in her feelings and her emotions she came to that place that day because she was thirsty she was part she may have needed water to cook there was a natural hunger that brought her to the well but jesus had needs to come to samaria and it had nothing to do with the weariness of his flesh it had nothing to do with the meat market in sacra it had nothing to do with natural hunger it had to do with the spiritual hunger and the heart of a young girl who needed contentment and needed rest and wouldn't find it in society wouldn't find in the synagogues she would only find it in one place at that well she was thinking more deeply something's been quick and now she's thinking she was actually kind of making fun of him a little bit hey you're a jew i'm a samaritan knock it off then he makes some kind of comment and she's like mr big shot here you think you're bigger than jacob but now the tone's changing wait a minute all right i was playing a little cute with you when i said i don't have a husband but then you just got real this escalated quickly because you just called me out on the fact that i've had five and the one i'm with now is not my husband and you just told me i was telling the truth even though i was really kind of trying to blow you off and jesus says unto her woman verse 21 believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither end this mountain or at jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know you what what we know what we worship for the salvation of the jews now he's kind of really dishonored as a samaritan but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him he said he must needs go through samaritan samaria whose need was he meeting father's hunger he needs he desires the father seek if he craves he's hungry for true worshipers god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth the woman said to him i know now this is getting deep i know that messiah cometh which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all things something about what he had to say made her get think you know what you're right you know i might have been sarcastic about jews and samaritans i i might have been sarcastic about jacob i might have been like well i'm not thirsty for this water neither did i come to draw but if you've got something i'll take it and i and i say that i perceive you're a prophet but i know i know these things that you're saying now has uncovered a desire deep inside of me and a longing in the craving that even i know as a samaritan that my redemption and my deliverance from bondage will be when he comes and jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he and the story all of a sudden interjects this and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman see they weren't free from the prejudice they probably thought that jesus had needs to go by samaria because this butcher shop and cycler was not too far away and we and jacob's well i mean we've read the reviews about jacob's well right it's worth a stop and they walk up what is he doing why is he talking to this woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talk is thou with her no one questioned them but they all said it in their hearts and as they walk up skeptical because they know what kind of woman this is who would be there at that time of day getting water like jesus come on that's his name they weren't using it in vain they're like jesus do you realize who you're talking to this doesn't look good we go to get some meat and this is what's happening and just that it's so natural it's so carnal so shallow and at this very moment he has just said i that speak unto thee am he and verse 28 the woman then left her water pot she had just carried this thing to a well for one reason to get water in order to live to satisfy a natural thirst she left it went her way into the city and as a woman that was a reproach an outcast estranged from her family turned out on the street five living husbands and with the men now that wasn't her husband she had enough boldness to go into the city and say come see a man which told me all things that i've ever did is not this the christ something had been shed away something had been washed away and she was no longer ashamed to stand upon something that she knew and it wasn't her lies and cards well this happened and that happened and this happened and that happened and it wasn't about jew or samaritan it wasn't about jacob and it wasn't about wells and it wasn't about me it was come see the christ come see the christ that satisfied something in my heart i've never felt free like this i've never felt satisfied i can never face you people of the city and tell you here's the messiah because i was ashamed i was a reproach i was sinful but now forgiven and set free come see a man then they went out of the city and followed her not because she was they were promised bread not because they were promised a miracle but because there was someone who could tell them who they were brother branham says in the message the mighty god unveiled before us referring to this story now what did this this i would just i'd like to emphasize this to you and then amplify it later next week lord willing what did this he says put in the old scripture with the experience that jesus was giving to her he's taken the prom prophecies of the word and what she was experiencing at the moment what did it do it made the messiah what's been written and prophesied had now dovetailed with what she was experiencing and now the word was being quickened made alive and what did it produce the messiah what she knew would come one day what she was longing for one day it made the messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable nothing she had done in her 20 years nothing she had done in those young few years that she had lived that that wasn't what identified her that's not what qualified her that's not what gave her entrance into the club that's not what made her a candidate at the well she didn't have the the linkedin profile that that that had the headhunter look her up and say hey i got a meeting with jesus today if you think you if you think you can make it no this is something that was connected with something at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in god's thinking at the beginning so it what was it the written word and her ex what she was experiencing what she was seeing what she was feeling this this piece that she was experiencing the layers that were being uncovered it was the fulfillment of the word of god it made the messiah it revealed the son of man to her and quickly she's new she's made free she's forgiven why did that happen because all along she was redeemable all along she had a quality and a characteristic that was not just driven by a thirsty flesh she i have to have a husband i need to be taken care of no you only did those things because deep down inside of you you were redeemable and you ran this way and you ran that way and you tried to do this and you tried to do that and join this and join that but at the end of the day there was only one that would satisfy and that was an experience that would take what was written and make the messiah she was redeemable so it redeemed her and brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifested of jehovah what he was what he is hallelujah think very deeply very spiritually saints could you not just think that's exactly i believe that god is dealing with hearts to know this to see this to experience this but could we who've had this could we not praise him yes that's what's happened to me the word i read as a child the things i heard as a young man one day one day i experienced it and it made the messiah this is not this was not man this was not a meal that my mother prepared it's not a sermon my dad preached but it was the word written beforehand coming to a redeemable son and it made the messiah and it made me free this is what the prostitute did and then when god when jesus did the very things in john chapter 6 to the religious and the and the upright and the pious it says the jews then murmured at him and said because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i am come down from heaven the most religious the most pious the most put together people see the same gift and one calls it beelzebub one rejects it and the other one who looks far from redeemable is the one that makes the messiah says come see a man there wasn't a hunger for redemption in those others as they sat there and saw at mavis there was no desire awakened and listen as i speak to you today i've been an hour and a half today already as i speak to you now i'm not reasoning with your mind i'm probing your heart i'm not trying to get up in your head's face and use logic i'm wanting to use scripture to peel back layers to where you sit there and you realize you're at a well today and there's word that's being read and you start to experience something and all of a sudden it makes a messiah who's welcoming you home who's saying it doesn't matter what you've done i'll take you from here don't be worried about what the future holds what about this what about that i'll take care of you hungry hungry for more than what you've experienced a hunger for more than what you felt hunger for peace think about all those thresholds right when i get there it'll smooth out right we always thought if i could just get there and it's never there the bible says in psalm 42 as the heart pantheth after the water brooks so my soul panteth after the o god panting heart this is a strong a panting hardest it's an audible thirst it's not hey would you like a red bull yeah i think i'll take i can take a red bull you'll want arnold palmer they're like a buck over here at salad to go you want one yeah yeah i'll take one yeah i got some room for it no this is your tongue is cleaving to the roof of your mouth you it's a matter of life or death it's a motivating force it's a painful desire as the woman ran away it says in the meantime while his disciples pray prayed him saying in the meantime while his disciples prayed him saying master eat come on master we went and got meat eat time to eat but he said to them i have meat to eat you know not of what he was just telling the woman from samaritan samaritan he's still trying to get his disciples to realize it therefore say if the disciples one to another if any man brought him ought to eat they're still literally thinking who gave him a cheesesteak like which one of you snuck up judas did you do doordash i mean like we're over here standing in line trying to get our food and you're over there ordering in they're literally asking i say literally but they're asking the question hey who gave him meat because they're still thinking in this realm when he says i got meat that you know not of they're not instinctively saying that's true lord that's true that's right we need to be start we need to be thinking more spiritual we need to think beyond what this flesh craves and wants and what would look good for this flesh he's jesus said them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work i've got something else to live by i've got something else to live for i'm not just living to know where i'm gonna eat my next meal i'm not like some of you who are talking about where you're gonna eat breakfast while you're eating dinner i've got something else i need to do you guys came this way so you could go to that butcher shop in cycle i came over here because god needed a true worshiper and we found one that's what he's saying i have a job to do my meek my substance where i have a different drive i have a different motivator in my hierarchy of needs i've got a base and a foundation and i've got one pyramid one food pyramid and it's do what the father wants me to do that's what i want to do that's my meat that's my motivator that's my force just as job belt out i have esteemed the words of god more than my necessary food that's the very heart of the messiah saying i live by what god wants me to do i'm sir i survive i thrive i'm fulfilled i'm happy not by having bread in my belly but by doing that which pleases god we live in a time when only christ will satisfy the redeemable i i i i'm going to leave off some scriptures here but i want to emphasize that we can pick this up at another time this is a time in an hour let me say this to everyone who will hear my voice though you as the redeemable are living in a season where only christ is going to satisfy it it's it we we've we've advanced and come to the place now where it's no you cannot play games you can't fiddle around you can't fool with this it's something that you've got to come to a place to recognize this is what god is doing this is what it means this is what it's for i in this desire and hunger i have in my heart is only going to be satisfied by the word i i say with great carefulness god could give you a different disease every day and heal you every afternoon and that would be awesome wouldn't it i guess the afternoons would be we would dread the mornings but oh miracle miracle miracle miracle milk miracle but if it's not the word if you're not coming to the word if the word's not if you're not saying if there's a god that can not only get me sick but heal it every day then can't there be a god that can lift me up above every challenge is there not a god is he not a god that can take the very specter of death and place it under my feet they let it mature me let it grow me let it let me take this desire this this these instances of healing if i was to be made sick and healed then audit not inspire me to run into the city and say come taste a word that can heal not inviting people to a church experience but an opportunity to make the messiah blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are they matthew chapter five verse six blessed are they which do hunger and thirst it's a desperate hunger jesus saying you're hungry for it if you're really thirsty for it it's not you know if your number's called you shall it's desperate this word righteousness has a very deep meaning but it's being in this state that you ought to be real you understand that righteousness is man being in this state as he ought to be now instead of in your mind thinking that righteousness is a certain length of skirt certain length of hair certain standard in the home and we start thinking about all the metrics by which we measure clothesline gospel and what we think the token is and what holiness is those things are what they are but at the end of the day it's not those things it's being what you're ought to be that's what you're hungry for blessed is he who hungers and thirsts for being what he ought to be who desires to be who he really is musicians come please are you desperate for peace do you have a painful desire to find yourself hungry in luke chapter 15 jesus tells the parable of what we call the prodigal son prodigal's a word that we've added it's not in the scripture he's not referred to as the prodigal in the scripture but rather it's the description that we give him because he was wasteful he took his inheritance and he wasted it and he goes and joins us becomes a citizen of a strange country he's a slave he's a servant he's given a job of feeding the pigs of corn and he found himself of necessity so hungry and without food that he would eat the pig's food and it was this is the miracle of this story the the dawn the beginning of this miracle in his redemption he would have died of hunger and he's there wrestling with the pangs of hunger and to satisfy this in his belly he's wanting to eat pig's food something happens and he thinks about something else and all of a sudden for a moment he wakes up [Music] and it says then when he came to himself how sweet that must have tasted when he remembered who he was i'm not a slave not a servant to this and he realized that even if he went back to his father's house as a servant it'd be better than what this was when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger and then he came to himself and he was that that began to satisfy that that was a taste that was a hunger and he was hungry enough to act he was hungry enough to say work past his brother's objections this guy you're gonna let him come back to church [Music] he was hungry enough to overcome his father's objections you've wasted all my inheritance why would i have you back he already knew he said father i know i'm not even worthy brother you're right i'm not even worthy i'm not coming back because i want anything back because i want a position i'm just coming back i'll be a servant i just want to eat and i know that you treat your servants well i'm coming back his hunger put him on the road back [Music] but what did he find redemption he didn't come back as a servant he didn't eat as a servant of the servant's table what did his father say come put on the best meal give him a robe let's put on a face for this my son which was dead is alive what did that hunger [Music] with heads bowed today are you hungry [Music] just ponder these things [Music] this was directed at someone who's ordained to crave god god is addressing very specific things it's a matter of life [Music] has god awakened a hunger for a bread that you've never known before [Music] is it coming into into view today is it becoming clear more clear that what i need isn't a new job what i need isn't a raise what i need isn't a new car what i need isn't this what i need isn't that what i need is you lord i invite you to receive him now if you know in your heart that's what you need would you receive him now [Music] heads are bowed there's no cameras on i'm just looking down the middle aisle if you want to receive him into your heart come to his table i welcome prodigals i welcome women at the well to just stand i'm coming home coming home to you lord you're the only one that will satisfy [Music] is there a hunger deep within your heart that you realize today only he can satisfy god bless those who've stood i want to invite you to receive him for my hunger why don't you just approach him that way in john chapter 4 the woman said well i don't know that i'm thirsty and i don't know that i came to draw this but give it to me maybe you could even say that to him lord i don't even not even sure what this guy is talking about but lord could you could you give me something could you start something could you walk through my life maybe in the sincerity of those in john chapter 6 lord evermore give us this bread maybe it could be as a prodigal i'm not even worthy to be called thy son i'll come and be a servant but have you recognized you're hungry if you want more of him today would you stand with these who stood to receive him [Music] god bless all of you who've stood [Music] let's lift up hungry hearts to him now he says feed me lord i'm hungry i'm hungry lord i'm desperate lord [Music] i need you lord [Music] the silence doesn't intimidate me [Music] silence doesn't bother god what moves him is a hungry heart you have a hungry heart just deep within you let it well up like a heart panting my soul thirst for happiness i long for peace i long to be who i am i don't even feel like myself i don't even feel like i belong lift up your eyes to the one who speaks to you today say oh god if you're real oh god if you're true oh god if it's you i need then touch me lord satisfy this longing deep within my person psychiatrists couldn't do it psychologists couldn't do it pursuits haven't done it accomplishments have not allayed my fears or quenched this hunger lord i've come to church today for a lot of other reasons maybe but now now something's making a messiah and i'm hungry for that oh god i pray for those standing for more of you that you would so take this hunger and energize it that it would become the greatest motivator and their chief appetite i pray lord you take those who've stood in their initial response to this this hunger that they have now lord i realize that for some it would not be just knowing you initially are just giving their heart to you but something has stirred within the heart of these individuals and they stood as one who would say lord give me this bread lord give me this meat lord give me this water and it would not be measured in calories lord would not be measured in weight loss it would be something of spiritual significance [Music] he said lord i've been thirsty i've made mistakes i've run i've hit i've tried i've cried i realized now it's been all along because i was hungry thank god that we could attribute all of our detours to the fact that we were redeemable [Music] and they were detours because we could never continue down that path we had to come back to this at this well today i say lord i will come to you with an open heart to receive you i may not know anything else other than to raise my hands or to say lord i love you or god help me or just to cry out the name jesus but here we are today lord hungry hungry hands lifted and hearts open it doesn't matter if they're broken touch us now i pray fill us strengthen us and encourage us in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
