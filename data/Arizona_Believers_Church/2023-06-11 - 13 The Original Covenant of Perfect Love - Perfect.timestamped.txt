[0:00] the original covenant of perfect love.
[0:02] And I'd like to through this service,
[0:04] we're going to be pulling a lot from the
[0:06] sermon marriage and divorce. And I don't
[0:08] say that now just to get everybody
[0:09] uptight. Um, but I will say that that is
[0:12] one of the most misunderstood sermons
[0:13] that brother Bradam preaches. Uh, and
[0:16] perhaps maybe one where people draw out
[0:19] a lot of things from it and they put
[0:21] this emphasis on it where uh, in my
[0:23] heart perhaps, uh, the wrong emphasis is
[0:26] put on it. Brother Brandham is teaching
[0:28] uh this lengthy sermon and there's just
[0:30] some things that we kind of zero in on
[0:32] and focus on and we kind of miss I think
[0:34] the bigger picture that brother Brandham
[0:35] was expressing. So I'd like to at the
[0:37] outset um I'm going to start with par
[0:40] paragraph 66. I have all the way to 76
[0:43] here before me but I read this at the
[0:45] outset and it's going to kind of put put
[0:47] some pieces out there. says now if that
[0:50] he says we have two schools of thought
[0:52] on marriage and divorce and so when he
[0:54] says there's two schools of thought pay
[0:56] close attention that he's not
[0:58] necessarily saying there's only two
[1:00] schools and that one of those is right
[1:02] he's saying this these are the
[1:03] prevailing schools of thought one of
[1:05] them says a man can only be married once
[1:07] unless his wife is dead and that's one
[1:09] of the questions but you go to following
[1:11] that you go overboard and then next says
[1:13] oh if the wife or husband either one has
[1:15] committed adultery either one of them
[1:16] can be put away and married again you
[1:18] find yourself overboard with that. So,
[1:20] it's neither southeast or northeast. We
[1:23] want directly east. You'd run out of
[1:25] scripture when you go this way and you'd
[1:26] run out of scripture when you go that
[1:28] way. We want to know where scripture
[1:30] meets scripture and know that's the
[1:32] truth of it. He says each takes a
[1:34] different way and failed to bring up the
[1:35] correct answer. But there still must be
[1:37] an answer. And he and then he uses the
[1:40] two great schools of doctrine in terms
[1:42] of Calvinism and Armenianism. He says
[1:44] one's a legalist, the other one's grace.
[1:46] He says that people who believe in the
[1:48] grace say, "Bless God, it don't hurt me
[1:50] to smoke. Don't hurt me to drink. I can
[1:51] do these things. I've got eternal
[1:53] security." Then on the other side, the
[1:55] legalist, oh, I'd like to ball them out.
[1:56] I'd like to show him a piece of my mind,
[1:58] but I'm a Christian. I have to keep
[1:59] still. So, he's showing these two
[2:01] different sides. He says, "You find
[2:03] yourself on two different roads." He
[2:04] says, "And neither one of them is
[2:06] right." Now, that's hard to say, but
[2:08] it's the truth. We find ourselves on two
[2:10] different roads. One going one way, one
[2:12] another. Now, let's see what truth is.
[2:14] So now again his pursuit is truth at the
[2:17] outset of this and then this is the part
[2:19] that I really wanted to read but I felt
[2:21] that that kind of gives greater context
[2:24] to this. He says now and let's see if
[2:26] this sounds sensible to you. For
[2:28] instance, if I got ready to go overseas,
[2:30] I'll take my own family. I'll call my
[2:32] wife to me and I'll say I'm going
[2:33] overseas, dear. Now here's the legal
[2:35] aside. Now my wife, I'm going to lay
[2:36] down the law to you. If you flirt with
[2:38] any man while I'm gone, when I come
[2:40] back, you're a divorced woman and I
[2:41] don't want you making eyes. Don't want
[2:43] you flirting. You understand that? I'm
[2:44] your husband. You do it, I'm going to
[2:45] put you away when I come back. Then she
[2:47] reaches and gets me by the tie and says,
[2:49] "My good man, I want to tell you
[2:50] something. If you make eyes at any woman
[2:52] or any woman or take any woman out or
[2:54] flirt with any woman, you're going to be
[2:55] a divorced man when you come back." Now,
[2:57] wouldn't that be a happy home? That's
[2:59] legalist. Says the other side. Now, if I
[3:01] go overseas, I make a mistake, go over
[3:03] and say, "Now look, I take this woman
[3:04] out. It's all right with my wife. She
[3:06] don't care. My wife say I'll go out with
[3:07] this man. It's all right. Built with
[3:08] Bill. He don't care. If I don't care,
[3:10] then there's something wrong with me. So
[3:13] that's that's a really good point. If I
[3:15] don't care, there's something wrong with
[3:16] me. I don't love that woman, right? And
[3:18] if she don't care, there's something
[3:20] wrong with her. She's my wife. I don't
[3:22] want other men fooling with her. She's
[3:23] my wife. He says, now the correct way of
[3:26] it is there's both of them has got a
[3:28] truth, but not the exact truth.
[3:31] Just see the things he's kind of entered
[3:32] into the record. He says, "Now when I go
[3:34] overseas to make it right, my little
[3:35] family gathers around and we pray with
[3:37] one another and I commit them to God.
[3:39] They commit me to God. And when we do,
[3:40] we go overseas. I now I know she loves
[3:43] me. I have confidence in her and I love
[3:45] her. She's got confidence in me. As long
[3:46] as I love her like that, she don't have
[3:48] any worry about me taking another woman
[3:50] out. As long as she loves me, right,
[3:52] why? There's no need of me thinking
[3:53] about any other man going out with her
[3:55] because she's my wife and I believe her.
[3:58] I believe if I would actually do
[3:59] something wrong, make a mistake and go
[4:01] out with some other woman and return
[4:03] back and would confess it to her and
[4:05] tell her me. I didn't mean to do that. I
[4:06] just got caught in a trap. The woman
[4:08] just run right up to me and grabbed me
[4:09] and started so and so. I believe she
[4:12] would be understanding. I believe she
[4:14] would forgive me for it, but I wouldn't
[4:16] do it for nothing because I love her.
[4:18] Though she would forgive me, I wouldn't
[4:19] do it. I wouldn't hurt her for nothing.
[4:21] Though I know she would forgive me for
[4:22] it, I don't want to hurt her.
[4:25] That's quite quite a scenario. And
[4:28] that's the way it is with God. If ailio
[4:31] love, which is human love, fellowship
[4:32] love, can make a man feel that about his
[4:34] wife, what about agape love, Greek word
[4:38] meaning the love of God? How would that
[4:39] make me do about Jesus Christ? I as long
[4:42] as I want to do it, it's in my heart to
[4:44] do it. I say as long as it's in my heart
[4:46] to do it, I go do it. Legalism won't let
[4:48] me do it. It's because I know it I'd get
[4:50] punished for doing it. But the real
[4:52] truth of it is, this is a part I think
[4:54] that just I want you to hold in your
[4:56] hearts. But the real truth of it is when
[4:59] the love of God comes into your heart
[5:00] till you want to do it, that's the truth
[5:02] of it. He said there's the two schools.
[5:04] No legalism or other or Calvinism. It's
[5:07] both.
[5:10] So that's uh like you to keep that in
[5:12] mind at the outset as we go forward. He
[5:14] said there's got to be an exact truth
[5:16] and I believe what he's identifying is
[5:18] the exact truth is right there in
[5:20] perfect love in the love of God. So uh
[5:23] just a few things to capture what we
[5:26] were on last Sunday. It was on for God
[5:29] so loved the world. We spent a few
[5:30] services on that. And the world we're
[5:32] talking about is the original world that
[5:34] God created. And in that world, it was
[5:36] under a covenant of perfect love. They
[5:38] were one with God and each other. Uh so
[5:41] being that having that harmony and that
[5:42] unity, there was no fear. There was no
[5:44] shame. And we know that brother Brandham
[5:46] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[5:48] is pointing to this. But the God's love
[5:50] was expressed in the unfolding of the
[5:52] image of that man and that woman in the
[5:55] beginning. Brother Brandham says in
[5:57] marriage and divorce then we find out
[5:58] that everything in the beginning was
[6:01] running in perfect order and harmony
[6:03] with God. Nothing was out of cater. So
[6:06] that's the original world that God
[6:07] loved. Everything in its place,
[6:09] everything operating, everything in
[6:10] harmony. That's in the beginning.
[6:13] Perfect order, perfect harmony. Nothing
[6:15] was out of cater. And this is the
[6:18] arrangement of man and woman. And that
[6:20] was a union. That was marriage is what's
[6:22] being expressed there. Brother Bramman
[6:24] in the sermon invisible union he says
[6:26] marriage is the oldest institution in
[6:27] the world. Marriage was performed first
[6:30] and instituted in the garden of Eden. We
[6:33] know that he characterized this union as
[6:35] his first masterpiece. It was a
[6:37] masterpiece family. So this is something
[6:40] that God loved as he brought forth the
[6:42] woman out of the man. He was portraying
[6:44] the bride knowing that the bride was
[6:45] God's heart purpose and the reason why
[6:47] he created the world. We see that the
[6:49] world uh that God loved is embodied in
[6:52] the heaven and the earth. the man and
[6:53] the woman that come forth. This
[6:55] expression and this image said they had
[6:57] perfect love for one for the other.
[6:59] Perfect life forever. They had perfect
[7:01] love and a perfect understanding of the
[7:04] love of God. That was man and woman in
[7:07] the beginning as God had intended them
[7:08] to be united in perfect love under a
[7:11] commandment. Be fruitful, multiply, and
[7:13] replenish the earth. And I want to call
[7:15] that world say that that was the
[7:18] original covenant that God had the
[7:20] original love covenant. this perfect
[7:22] love one for another, this perfect love
[7:24] for God, all of them bound together
[7:25] under one covenant. Now, if you'll take
[7:28] a look at Genesis chapter 2, and we hope
[7:32] to be jumping fully into this now,
[7:34] Genesis chapter 2, 23 and 24. Now, as
[7:38] the woman came out from him and they
[7:41] were brought together, this is Adam's
[7:43] declaration. This is now bone of my
[7:45] bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall
[7:49] be called woman because she was taken
[7:52] out of man. Therefore shall a man leave
[7:55] his father and his mother and shall
[7:57] cleave unto his wife and they shall be
[8:00] one flesh. Now I believe I'll probably
[8:03] make this point later on, but notice how
[8:06] that Paul says that we are members of
[8:09] his body and of his flesh and of his
[8:10] bones. And and he quotes quote he's
[8:13] quoting these very same scriptures from
[8:16] Genesis 23. Flesh of his flesh, bone of
[8:19] his bones, flesh of his flesh. He says,
[8:21] "We are bone of his bones and flesh of h
[8:23] flesh of his flesh." And Adam is
[8:25] declaring this. And then therefore shall
[8:27] a man leave his father and mother shall
[8:28] cleave on his wife and they shall be one
[8:30] flesh. Paul is quoting that specifically
[8:32] and he says this is a great mystery. So
[8:34] there's a mystery in this even in the
[8:37] beginning and this is part of that
[8:40] original covenant. the man's attitude
[8:42] towards the woman, what the woman meant
[8:44] to the man. And this is where we drew
[8:46] from in Ephesians 5:29. For no man yet
[8:49] hated his own flesh. When Adam looks at
[8:52] the woman, bone of my bone, flesh of my
[8:55] flesh, he is he's declaring that she is
[8:59] my own flesh.
[9:00] Brother Brandham said she was right with
[9:02] man, co-equal with man. And so because
[9:07] they were co-equal, and this is I maybe
[9:11] need to take a deep breath so I don't
[9:12] just pass over this. She was right with
[9:14] man, co-equal with man. Therefore, there
[9:18] was only there was only need of one
[9:22] covenant,
[9:22] right?
[9:23] Because here's Adam. She becomes a a
[9:26] second self to him. She is just like
[9:29] him. So God didn't need um more than one
[9:32] command covenant. It was for the both of
[9:35] them. So there's only one marriage
[9:36] covenant in the beginning. There was
[9:39] mutual love, shared love. It was the
[9:41] same. It was mutual honor, mutual
[9:43] respect for each other. And it's
[9:45] important to consider this how they what
[9:47] they shared and how it was equal and it
[9:48] was commisserate one with another. And
[9:50] and how that she being a second self,
[9:52] the mirror image, but yet complimentary
[9:54] to him. This is what is expressed in
[9:57] Genesis 2. She is me. She she is
[10:00] everything that I am. Bone of my bone,
[10:02] flesh of my flesh. And brethren, I says
[10:04] she's co-equal with him. Now, there's a
[10:06] lot that I want you to uh picture in a
[10:08] in your mind when we speak of this
[10:11] co-equality and this mutual love that
[10:14] they had for each other. And brother
[10:15] Bramman in the sermon, you must be born
[10:17] again said she couldn't get scared.
[10:19] Wasn't nothing about her to scare. She
[10:22] had perfect love and love casteth out
[10:25] fear.
[10:26] Amen.
[10:27] So, there was in this condition, she she
[10:29] couldn't get a she wasn't afraid of
[10:31] anything. She couldn't. There was
[10:33] nothing about her that could be scared
[10:35] and she had perfect love and that
[10:38] perfect love kept fear away. Brother
[10:40] Brandham says it this way impersonation
[10:42] of Christianity said and Adam looked
[10:45] lonesome so he made a byproduct for him
[10:47] and took a rib from his side and made
[10:49] him a sweetheart Eve. And he loved Adam
[10:52] and he loved Eve. There's God's perfect
[10:54] love for them. And he takes them and I
[10:56] can see little Eve as she laid her
[10:57] little head against the shoulder of
[10:58] Adam. And she was everything that a
[11:00] woman could ever and he she was
[11:02] everything that a woman could ever
[11:03] expect and more. And as she laid against
[11:05] the big strong shoulder of her
[11:06] sweetheart Adam and they walked through
[11:08] the garden, he was a son of God. She was
[11:11] his sweetheart. That was a love with no
[11:14] fear, with no shame. That it was a
[11:16] perfect uh with no guile and no
[11:19] hypocrisy.
[11:20] And what I think is beautiful and how
[11:23] that brother describes they're
[11:24] shouldertosh shoulder. They're walking
[11:25] together. They're moving together. And
[11:27] there there's no power imbalance. Uh the
[11:31] woman isn't looking at him like, "Oh my
[11:33] goodness, that that man is so strong.
[11:35] He's so much bigger than me. And man, if
[11:36] he got angry with me, he could really
[11:38] let me have it." Or he could do a lot of
[11:39] damage to me. Or wow, he he's my way in
[11:42] this world, and if I don't follow him, I
[11:43] won't be able to eat. And he's the god
[11:45] of all the world, and if I don't listen
[11:47] to him, then he's going to let me have
[11:48] it. or he could banish me. Uh uh and she
[11:51] wasn't over there just kind of checking
[11:52] every once in a while to see if he had
[11:53] other ribs and thinking, "Oh, well man,
[11:55] he's got this many. That just means
[11:57] there's more of me in there that he
[11:59] could bring out whenever he wants." But
[12:00] it was that perfect headship of nurture
[12:02] and harmony. Uh where that they were
[12:06] submitted to each other. And it wasn't
[12:08] that one had something over the other
[12:10] because he says, "You, you're myself.
[12:12] You're my second self." And so as it
[12:15] says in Ephesians 5:21
[12:18] 5:29, "For no man ever yet hated his own
[12:20] flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
[12:23] even as the Lord the church."
[12:26] And so in this description, I think that
[12:28] we can see that both Adam and Christ
[12:30] fit. That Adam is saying to the woman,
[12:33] "You are my flesh." That Christ says to
[12:36] his bride, "You are my flesh." Brother
[12:38] Brham said, the bride and the groom is
[12:40] the same flesh and blood, the same
[12:42] ministry. So as the woman was the same
[12:44] flesh and blood of Adam, the bride is
[12:46] the same flesh and blood of Christ. He
[12:47] says it's got to be his same flesh, same
[12:49] bone, same spirit, same everything just
[12:51] exactly built up. And the two of them be
[12:54] then become one.
[12:55] So as Adam would have looked at the
[12:57] woman and had this description, we need
[12:59] to see that the bride today is the
[13:02] fulfillment of what that foreshadowed.
[13:05] The bride and Christ today are the
[13:07] perfect fulfillment of what that typed.
[13:10] And so what I what I like to do is turn
[13:12] that around to where we're that we are
[13:13] not a type of Adam and the woman, but
[13:15] they were a type of what God was going
[13:16] to achieve. Brother Brandon then says,
[13:18] "She is flesh of his flesh, bone of his
[13:20] bone, life of his life, power of his
[13:23] power. She is him."
[13:26] So as he says, "No man ever yet hated
[13:29] his own flesh." We could say that
[13:31] neither Adam nor Christ hated their
[13:33] wife. So there is a very uh there this
[13:37] is a very specific saying
[13:40] and and and I I'll come back to some
[13:42] scriptures later but he says for no man
[13:43] ever never yet hated his own flesh. I
[13:46] I'm wanting to broaden our scope of what
[13:48] that looks like because we say well that
[13:51] uh you love love love your wife as
[13:54] yourself and no man has ever hated
[13:56] himself. So then he must or we must love
[13:58] her as I would me. But he's actually
[14:01] bringing it back to the image of Adam
[14:03] who the woman would stand as a mirror
[14:05] image to him and that would be himself.
[14:07] So he would love her as a part of
[14:09] himself. Christ then loves you as being
[14:12] an essential part of himself.
[14:14] Now brother Brandham makes this
[14:16] statement in marriage and divorce. The
[14:18] woman not the man. She broke the
[14:21] covenant.
[14:23] Brother Brandham is saying or excuse me
[14:25] the scripture is saying no man ever yet
[14:27] hated his own flesh. to make a point.
[14:30] Now, it says the woman, not the man, she
[14:32] broke the covenant. She broke the
[14:34] covenant because why? She stepped across
[14:36] the borders of God's word. Now, if she
[14:38] broke her covenant with her husband, she
[14:40] broke her covenant with God. Then,
[14:42] because she broke the covenant with God,
[14:44] she broke it with her husband. Now, this
[14:46] is an important event. This is an
[14:48] important characterization of what
[14:49] happened. If man and the woman in the
[14:50] beginning were co-equal, they existed
[14:52] together in perfect harmony. Now, the
[14:54] woman broke the covenant, the single
[14:56] covenant that they were under. When she
[14:58] does that, she does it to God. She does
[15:00] it to her husband. But now, as we
[15:03] touched on last Sunday, when the woman
[15:06] broke the marriage covenant and she
[15:08] comes to Adam,
[15:11] and I think it's important to think
[15:13] about uh well, maybe it's not important
[15:16] to think about it, but it's important as
[15:17] the scripture says to know Adam did not
[15:19] sin. Adam was not deceived. So when she
[15:22] breaks the marriage covenant and she
[15:23] comes to him, he intervenes is what
[15:27] brother Brandham said.
[15:28] He saved her by intervening. Says he
[15:31] took her to himself. So the woman has
[15:34] broken the marriage covenant. She comes
[15:36] to the man. And when she comes to the
[15:38] man and shows him symbolically the fruit
[15:40] of the tree and they both parttook. So
[15:43] and it says now their eyes are open.
[15:44] They're both naked. They're both
[15:45] ashamed. When Adam acts, he is not
[15:47] deceived. In other words, he's not
[15:50] overtaken by lust. She doesn't repreach
[15:53] the serpent sermon and he FINDS HIMSELF
[15:55] GOING, "WHOA, WOW." AND RECEIVE IT IN
[15:58] HIS MIND first and then the natural act
[15:59] taking place. He's not overtaken by
[16:02] lust. He acts immediately
[16:04] and intervenes and takes her to himself.
[16:06] I'm just saying what brother Brandham
[16:08] said. And by the same token, Adam was
[16:11] not in the transgression. Adam was not
[16:13] deceived
[16:15] in the same way that the as the woman
[16:17] was. And he acted in a figure of him
[16:20] that was to come, which is Christ. And
[16:22] so WE KNOW THAT CHRIST WAS NOT deceived
[16:24] into sin, but he laid his life down.
[16:29] And so as the woman broke the marriage
[16:31] covenant and Adam begins to act at the
[16:33] same time, we realize she's the one that
[16:35] broke it. Adam acted to save her in
[16:37] light of her breaking the covenant.
[16:40] So in Genesis 3:16 when God is now not
[16:43] cursing the woman, but this is the
[16:45] consequence of her sin. Unto the woman,
[16:48] he said,"I will greatly multiply thy
[16:49] sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow,
[16:52] thou shalt bring forth children." I
[16:53] think we looked at that in greater
[16:55] detail last week, if not more in the
[16:57] past. And then this statement here is
[16:58] what I'd like you to focus on. And thy
[17:01] desire shall be to thy husband, and he
[17:04] shall rule over thee.
[17:06] We'll read the statements in here just a
[17:07] moment. But this is where brother
[17:08] Brandham says another covenant's
[17:10] introduced. Says, "And thy desire shall
[17:13] be to thy husband, and he shall rule
[17:14] over thee." This is not the original
[17:17] covenant.
[17:19] There's been a change in their
[17:20] relationship. The woman broke her
[17:22] covenant to God, and she broke her
[17:23] covenant to man. Now, in light of the
[17:25] fact because thou has done this, and
[17:27] this has happened, there is a change in
[17:30] the covenant. There's a change in the
[17:31] relationship. And he says, "Thy desire
[17:34] shall be to thy husband." That statement
[17:36] means co-equality's been lost.
[17:40] That is plain and simple. When you read
[17:41] it, HE'S SAYING, "OH, THY DESIRE shall
[17:43] be to YOUR HUSBAND." NOW, NOW
[17:45] SOMETHING'S BEEN CHANGED to where they
[17:47] were once co-equal, but now when he
[17:50] says, "Thy desire SHALL BE TO YOUR
[17:51] HUSBAND," he's saying there has been a
[17:53] shift in the relationship.
[17:56] In Genesis 4:7, if you go to read it,
[17:58] God says says to Cain, "Unto Cain shall
[18:01] be Abel's desire. Unto you shall be your
[18:04] brother's desire." In other words,
[18:06] there's going he would continue to
[18:08] submit himself to you and subject
[18:09] himself to you as the firstborn. So, if
[18:12] thou doest well, will you not also be
[18:15] accepted? And a and his desire shall be
[18:17] to you. He's saying that there's a there
[18:19] would still be this reverence and this
[18:20] all and this acknowledgement that you
[18:22] being born first, you're the heir. you
[18:24] being born first, uh you're you're the
[18:26] more preeminent one. There had been some
[18:28] acknowledgment of that respect that the
[18:31] younger and the lesser would have to
[18:32] give to the older.
[18:34] So when he says, "Thy desire shall be to
[18:36] thy husband," in plain language,
[18:38] whatever that co-equality was has now
[18:40] been diminished.
[18:42] It's very important to understand that.
[18:44] Amen.
[18:44] And then he says, "And he shall rule
[18:46] over thee." That word rule means have
[18:48] dominion and control over you. It's used
[18:51] of the lights in the sky ruling the
[18:53] night and day.
[18:55] So before this, under the original
[18:58] covenant, these words aren't even used.
[19:00] It's coequality. It's love, it's honor,
[19:03] it's respect, it's reverence, but it's
[19:04] not this dominion and control. And so
[19:09] before
[19:11] there was no subjection in the sense of
[19:13] Adam exercising authority. There was no
[19:16] submission in the sense that the woman
[19:18] was scared of Adam. So there was I want
[19:22] you to think about that. There was no
[19:24] subjection in this uh power imbalance
[19:27] sense or this exercising of authority by
[19:31] Adam where he's like woman I'm the head
[19:32] woman I'm the man. It wasn't necessary,
[19:35] right?
[19:36] Even if we even though we would
[19:37] acknowledge the man was the head, it it
[19:41] didn't create opportunity, privilege,
[19:43] and power that he took advantage of in
[19:46] order to cause the woman to do what he
[19:47] wanted her to do.
[19:49] And I'm going to read a statement.
[19:51] You're going to go, you should have just
[19:52] read that and save five minutes. But
[19:54] brother reads this scripture. Genesis
[19:56] 3:16, "And thy desire shall be to thy
[19:57] husband, he shall rule over you." Points
[19:59] to the scripture. says, "Now it was then
[20:01] man was made to rule over the woman by
[20:04] God's word. She was no more co-equal
[20:07] with him."
[20:08] If you ever, if you're ever trying to
[20:10] figure out where I get this, you better
[20:11] just jump more into this message.
[20:13] Listen, listen, listen to it. Read it.
[20:15] Read it. Read it. Read it. It's
[20:16] available to us because this is my
[20:18] inspiration as the message of the hour.
[20:20] She was then, man. It was then at that
[20:23] moment at the institution of this other
[20:25] covenant that man was made to rule over
[20:27] the woman by God's word. she was no
[20:29] longer co-equal with him. Brother Ram
[20:32] goes into great detail in the sermon
[20:33] marriage and divorce. I believe even at
[20:34] the beginning he's kind of trying to
[20:35] say, "Hey, there's a lot of things I
[20:36] have to say here. I don't know if I
[20:38] really want to say it." And he's wanting
[20:40] to do it in order so that he can
[20:41] emphasize why there's been a change
[20:44] and why God has arranged things that he
[20:46] has after the fall, but it's then with
[20:48] this uh when this happens when the women
[20:51] woman brings a double covenant, he's
[20:53] saying that's when the man is a rule
[20:55] over her and she's no longer co-equal.
[20:57] So we realize that by her actions she
[20:59] brings a double covenant wherein man is
[21:02] under a covenant and the woman is under
[21:03] a covenant. And I think that's uh that
[21:06] is expressed in the message very clearly
[21:08] as brother Benham teaches this. And if
[21:11] we could if we could just
[21:14] uh for time sake think of it this way
[21:17] when we read Genesis chapter 3 and we
[21:20] see the curses and the consequences and
[21:23] he begins to arrange the man to the
[21:24] woman. Thy desire shall be to thy
[21:26] husband. and he shall rule over thee. It
[21:27] doesn't mention love,
[21:29] doesn't mention respect or reverence in
[21:33] the way that we would expect it to be
[21:34] mentioned because the fallen nature
[21:37] needed a different covenant to govern
[21:38] the union.
[21:40] So, brother Brandham, marriage and
[21:41] divorce has two covenants. Now, that
[21:43] closes the beginning.
[21:45] So, in the beginning was this original
[21:47] covenant, perfect love, no fear, she was
[21:49] a sweetheart. The woman breaks that
[21:52] covenant and then after the covenant is
[21:54] broken, the consequence to her is now
[21:56] there's no longer a covenant. There's
[21:58] two covenants and he says that closes
[22:01] the beginning. So that original covenant
[22:03] is now is barred off and gone. There's
[22:06] new covenants that are introduced. He
[22:08] says in marriage and divorce after the
[22:10] fall there's another covenant made. Now
[22:12] she was no longer ruler with him. Each
[22:14] must have a separate covenant. And
[22:17] notice how important it is to understand
[22:18] why the man is made the ruler and why
[22:20] thy desire shall be to thy husband. And
[22:22] even as brother Bam goes on to say,
[22:24] there's consequences in the fall why the
[22:26] woman couldn't occupy certain positions
[22:28] and have certain kinds of authority,
[22:30] right?
[22:31] That she she cannot fill in certain
[22:33] places. She cannot exercise certain
[22:35] authority. Brother saying the reason why
[22:36] is because the role that she played in
[22:38] the fall
[22:40] and and he's going to great lengths to
[22:41] say that so that we can understand why
[22:43] it's arranged that it is. She's no
[22:45] longer ruler with him. Each must have a
[22:48] separate covenant. Now, if I could say
[22:49] this since I've already said it before,
[22:51] the woman could not rule and reign with
[22:54] him under the double covenant.
[22:57] But will not the bride rule and reign
[22:59] with him in the millennium and forever
[23:01] more?
[23:02] Now, think about that then.
[23:05] What are the implications?
[23:07] So, he says there is a covenant for the
[23:09] product and the byproduct.
[23:13] Those are the two covenants after the
[23:15] fall. After the fall, there's a lot of
[23:17] ways we could describe this, but now
[23:19] there's so many more emotions that are
[23:20] mixed in there. Before the fall, they
[23:22] could never be afraid.
[23:24] But now that there's fear and with fear
[23:27] comes doubt and suspicion and all these
[23:28] things or doubt comes fear and all these
[23:30] ways that you could begin to describe
[23:31] it, this cascading domino effect of sin,
[23:34] we find that there's now going to be
[23:37] fear mixed with filio love. There's
[23:39] going to be doubt and suspicion and
[23:41] animosity and lust and all these other
[23:42] things mixed into their love. It's not
[23:45] going to be a love of a higher
[23:46] intelligence. It's not going to be a
[23:47] love that's united with one purpose. And
[23:49] because it's not perfect, it requires a
[23:52] different covenant.
[23:54] Now, brother Brandham says in marriage
[23:56] and divorce, now you see then after the
[23:58] beginning, it was something else
[24:00] introduced. He says, now this is going
[24:02] to shock you. And as I read over this
[24:04] and even in the past when I read over
[24:06] it, I thought the shock and I don't know
[24:08] that this is too you all are going to
[24:10] think brother Aaron you you should be
[24:12] ashamed of yourself. But to me I always
[24:15] read it in the sense of it's going to
[24:17] shock you because he's using the word
[24:18] sex and that somehow this polygamy and
[24:21] the things he begins to talk about is is
[24:23] shocking and pearl clutching. But it's
[24:25] even more shocking to me now when I read
[24:27] this because it's like wow he saw this
[24:30] coming. says after the beginning it was
[24:32] something else was introduced. Something
[24:34] else is introduced. Now I would say
[24:36] something else was introduced. Therefore
[24:38] something else was introduced.
[24:40] Something else was introduced by the
[24:42] wicked one. God then has to give a
[24:43] double covenant. Says after the
[24:46] beginning. So the fall is after is part
[24:48] of that after the beginning. God now
[24:50] secondarily sets a new nature again by
[24:53] sex.
[24:54] He created the first without sex. Do you
[24:57] believe that? Now it's another covenant
[24:59] with nature. He sets it in ANOTHER ORDER
[25:02] BY SEX.
[25:04] So when God created,
[25:06] he did not rely upon gender.
[25:09] Right? Adam and the woman were not
[25:11] gendered.
[25:12] The the man was created and the woman
[25:14] was formed from the man or taken from
[25:16] the man. But he says after the
[25:18] beginning, once the beginning is over,
[25:20] now we're this new beginning. He sets a
[25:22] new nature again. Something else is
[25:24] introduced. And it's another covenant
[25:26] with nature. And he sets it in order by
[25:28] sex.
[25:29] And now what's striking then is to
[25:32] recognize to me Satan's agenda against
[25:36] gender
[25:38] because the double covenants exist.
[25:41] We see that the what we know what the
[25:42] original sin was and so we see how
[25:44] that's associated with it but recognize
[25:47] how gender was at the core of that.
[25:50] And so NOW THAT THEY THAT GOD then
[25:54] this is really going to make the devil
[25:56] mad. In the beginning, God was
[25:58] non-binary in the sense that there was
[26:00] one covenant.
[26:01] And then the devil's the ONE THAT
[26:03] CREATED THIS BINARY SYSTEM.
[26:06] He's over there kicking something right
[26:07] now. HE'S LIKE, "MY GOODNESS, IT'S
[26:09] BACKFIRING."
[26:11] Which I do think it's kind of funny that
[26:12] they say they're non-binary, thereby
[26:14] creating a binary structure. But say
[26:18] this is IT IS BY GENDER, BY SEX. AND
[26:21] THEN I know that that has further maybe
[26:24] more important. We know what brother
[26:25] Bam's referring to. But now think about
[26:27] just on another level, at a greater
[26:30] level, but just another level. How that
[26:32] it's one for the man, one for the woman.
[26:34] He sets in a different nature and a
[26:36] different order according to the sex.
[26:40] And then brother Brandon makes this
[26:42] statement, but notice now it wasn't so
[26:45] at the beginning.
[26:47] If I could SAY THIS, IT WASN'T LIKE this
[26:48] at the beginning. There wasn't two
[26:49] covenants at the beginning. She was
[26:51] ruler with him in the beginning. After
[26:53] the beginning is when something else was
[26:55] introduced. In the beginning, God didn't
[26:56] there wasn't new natures. He didn't set
[26:58] a secondarily nature in there. There
[27:00] wasn't another covenant with one nature
[27:02] and another nature. There wasn't another
[27:03] order. There was one.
[27:07] He says it wasn't so at the beginning.
[27:09] But now it's after the beginning. I This
[27:11] is one of the most important pieces of
[27:12] this sermon. Not the one I'm preaching
[27:14] necessarily, but marriage and divorce.
[27:15] It's one of the most important pieces
[27:18] because he wants us to understand WHY
[27:20] THINGS ARE SO MIXED UP.
[27:23] He wants us to understand how people get
[27:24] into these messes AND HOW PEOPLE
[27:26] MISUNDERSTAND and why the world is in
[27:28] the condition it's in. He wants us to go
[27:30] back to the beginning when in the
[27:32] beginning ended and the fall is now
[27:33] fully accomplished this mess that we get
[27:36] into. And as he does that, HE SAYS IT
[27:38] WASN'T like this in the beginning. He's
[27:40] not only doing it so that we could
[27:41] understand the mess we're in, but as
[27:43] soon as he does that, he's trying to say
[27:45] this is what it was like in the
[27:48] beginning.
[27:49] He's wanting us to see how it should be.
[27:53] So the phrase he says now it wasn't so
[27:55] at the beginning. He's taking the very
[27:57] words of Jesus in Matthew 19 in Matthew
[28:01] 19:es 3 to8 if you'd like to look on the
[28:04] screens or turn in your Bibles or flip
[28:06] scroll whatever it is you do. Uh maybe
[28:09] if you have your your Provision goggles
[28:12] maybe it just populates right there in
[28:13] virtual reality and 3D. says, "The
[28:15] Pharisees also came unto him, tempting
[28:17] him and saying to him, is it lawful for
[28:19] a man to put away his wife for every
[28:21] cause?"
[28:23] And this is a question tempting him,
[28:25] trying to trap him. Can a man divorce,
[28:28] put away his divorce, his wife for every
[28:30] cause? Can he for any reason he wants to
[28:33] put a his wife away? Now notice Jesus's
[28:36] answer. Have you not read that he which
[28:39] made them at the beginning made them
[28:41] male and female? Genesis 1. A and and
[28:46] said, "For this cause shall a man leave
[28:49] father and mother and shall cleave to
[28:50] his wife." Genesis 2,
[28:53] and they twain shall be one flesh. Is it
[28:57] lawful for a man to divorce his wife for
[28:58] any reason? And instead of and Jesus
[29:01] instead of trying to answer that
[29:02] question, go, "Well, that's a very good
[29:03] question. Let's let's kind of parse this
[29:05] down." He goes all the way back and he's
[29:07] like, "Wait a minute. Didn't you know
[29:08] that God in the beginning intended man
[29:10] and woman to be one,
[29:11] one flesh?"
[29:14] you know, kind of at least suggesting
[29:16] how could you divide that,
[29:18] right? I mean, where where is the
[29:19] division to this? And he says,
[29:21] "Wherefore they are no more twain, but
[29:23] one flesh." This is Genesis 2. He says,
[29:28] "What therefore God has joined together,
[29:29] let no man put put us under." Now, that
[29:32] that really pinches it, doesn't it?
[29:34] He's saying, "Okay, you're saying how
[29:36] can a man divorce his wife for any
[29:38] reason and and separate?" And he goes,
[29:40] "Well, God made man and woman that that
[29:42] when they unite together, they're one
[29:44] flesh. How can they ever be separate?
[29:45] Whatever God has joined together, this
[29:47] great phrase that we use in our marriage
[29:49] ceremonies, what God has joined
[29:50] together, let no man put us under.
[29:52] This can't be divided." So when he says
[29:55] this, this has naturally kind of
[29:57] provoked them to think, okay, so what
[29:59] you're saying is a man, a man shouldn't
[30:02] put his wife away for any reason, but
[30:04] now you're saying a man can't even put
[30:06] away his wife
[30:07] because they're one flesh.
[30:08] And what God has joined together, let no
[30:10] man put us under. Now we know all the
[30:12] creative ways that people try to get
[30:14] around that says, "Well, was it really
[30:15] God that married me when that man
[30:17] backslid?"
[30:18] You know, that preacher's no longer in
[30:19] the message. You realize that, right?
[30:20] And they use all I just went to the just
[30:22] peace. come up with all sorts of ideas
[30:24] that there was no way that God was part
[30:25] of that union. But we're not going off
[30:26] into the the sophism of that. We're
[30:29] looking at the fact that his answer says
[30:31] and suggests to them, no, a man can't
[30:34] even divorce his wife. Now, I'm not
[30:35] saying that's what he's saying, but then
[30:37] that's that's the way they took it.
[30:39] Because look at their next question in
[30:40] verse 7. They say to him, why did Moses
[30:43] then command to give a ridden of
[30:44] divorcement and to PUT HER AWAY? WHY
[30:48] WOULD HE ALLOW US THIS WRITING OF
[30:49] DIVORCEMENT, THIS RID OF DIVORCEMENT TO
[30:51] PUT A WIFE away if when God has joined
[30:53] us together, you can't put us put us
[30:55] aunder?
[30:57] So that's the way that they take it is
[30:58] Jesus says, "Well, let me bring you back
[31:00] to the beginning where God made man and
[31:02] woman, one. And how are you going to how
[31:04] can you divorce that? The man and the
[31:06] wife are one flesh. Now you can't you
[31:08] can't put that aunderder like well then
[31:10] why did Moses give us permission to do
[31:12] it?"
[31:13] Are you are you tracking that? You don't
[31:15] have to agree with me, but I would at
[31:17] least want you to see. Well, okay, I see
[31:18] where you're coming from. Keep going.
[31:20] Let me know where you're want where
[31:21] you're going with this. Says, he said
[31:23] unto them, here's his answer. Why did
[31:26] Moses let us divorce our wives? Moses
[31:28] let you divorce your wives. Because of
[31:30] the hardness of your hearts.
[31:32] This is his answer. Moses, because of
[31:34] the hardness of your hearts, suffered
[31:36] you to put away your wives. But from the
[31:39] beginning, it was not so.
[31:42] WE CANNOT MISS THIS POINT.
[31:45] He said, "Well, then why does why does
[31:46] the law let us put away our wives? Why
[31:48] does the law give us permission to
[31:49] divorce our wives?" He's saying, "It's
[31:52] not because the wife, it's because of
[31:55] you.
[31:56] It's because of your hard hearts that
[31:59] Moses allowed you to divorce your
[32:01] wives." He says, "But from the
[32:03] beginning, it was not so." Well, what
[32:05] what in the beginning was not so? Have
[32:08] we sufficiently established for our
[32:09] sakes this morning what in the beginning
[32:12] was and what after the beginning was? In
[32:14] the beginning was Adam and the woman
[32:16] under one covenant arranged perfectly
[32:18] together co-equal. The woman broke that
[32:21] covenant. Adam did not break that
[32:24] covenant. After the covenant is broken,
[32:26] a new nature is set in. New order is
[32:28] setting in. There's things that have
[32:30] been defiled. So now God secondarily
[32:32] sets in a double covenant after the
[32:34] fall. So when brother Brandham answers
[32:36] this or when Jesus is answering this and
[32:38] he says, "Well, from the beginning IT
[32:39] WAS NOT SO, HE'S WANTING YOU TO THINK
[32:41] ABOUT ADAM AND the woman
[32:44] and how that the law has been instituted
[32:46] as a RESULT OF THE FALL." And the reason
[32:48] why ye let you divorce is because your
[32:51] fallen nature.
[32:55] So divorce and remarage only become an
[32:57] issue after the double covenant's
[32:59] instituted.
[33:02] So when
[33:07] Christ is facing the question of divorce
[33:10] and I would say the subsequent issue of
[33:12] remarage
[33:14] we often we often focus on the remarage
[33:17] aspect right in mar the sermon is
[33:20] marriage and divorce but we've all
[33:22] retitled it as who can remarry
[33:26] I mean it's marriage and divorce and we
[33:29] all go always saying, "Do you ever hear
[33:30] brother Bam's sermon on remarage?"
[33:38] You know, it's true.
[33:41] So, it's only after marriage and divorce
[33:45] that even an issue of remarage comes
[33:49] becomes an issue. So, on the question of
[33:52] divorce and I would say the issue of
[33:53] marriage and divorce, Christ goes back
[33:56] to the beginning.
[33:59] when he's asked, he doesn't say, "Well,
[34:01] let's unpack this. Uh, if you could grab
[34:03] your scrolls and uh and let's just I say
[34:05] let's go through this a little bit and
[34:07] uh do you have any particular instance
[34:08] you're referring to and what causes are
[34:10] you talking about?" And he he just said,
[34:12] "Well, let's just start off by
[34:14] establishing first the way God in his
[34:16] perfect will established it."
[34:19] Remember I said that these those three
[34:21] sermons on God so love was a setup.
[34:23] We're getting really close to pulling
[34:24] the trap here.
[34:26] So Christ goes back to the beginning in
[34:27] the sermon marriage and divorce. Brother
[34:29] man says THE QUESTION THE TRUE ANSWER
[34:31] THAT JESUS wants us to go back to is to
[34:33] go back to the beginning
[34:35] when it comes to the two schools of
[34:37] thought when it comes to issues of
[34:39] marriage and divorce when it comes to
[34:41] the secondary issue that we think to be
[34:42] the most important who can remarry he
[34:45] says let's go back to the true answer
[34:47] let's go back to the beginning because
[34:48] that's what Jesus pointed us to he says
[34:50] that would be in Genesis because the
[34:52] word Genesis is the seed chapter to
[34:54] every question in the Bible
[34:57] so when Jesus says, "Oh,
[35:00] but God," I said, "Can a man divorce his
[35:02] wife for any reason?" He says, "Well,
[35:04] haven't you read that in the beginning,
[35:05] God made man, male and female, and
[35:07] whatsoever God joined and they were one
[35:08] flesh, and whatsoever God had put
[35:10] together, let no man put us under?" He
[35:11] says, "That's God's original marriage
[35:13] was instituted by God in the Garden of
[35:15] Eden."
[35:16] This is how God envisioned a marriage to
[35:18] work. And they thought, "Okay, so you're
[35:21] saying we can't." Well, if you're saying
[35:22] we can't, then why did Moses say we can?
[35:24] He goes, "Oh, if that's your question,
[35:26] you want to know why you do and why you
[35:28] can't." He says, "Because your hard
[35:30] hearts,
[35:31] right?
[35:32] Because your hard hearts, he lets you do
[35:34] it." And he says, "But from the
[35:36] beginning,
[35:38] that wasn't the way that it was."
[35:40] So, under the original covenant, there
[35:42] was a different arrangement. There was a
[35:43] different agreement. There was a the
[35:45] covenant had different actions that were
[35:48] required and certain actions that were
[35:50] were not allowed. The woman acted in
[35:53] violation of that.
[35:55] But after the fall, it was necessary. I
[35:57] know I keep saying this. It was
[35:58] necessary to institute another covenant.
[36:01] Why? The original sin mixes our nature
[36:02] with evil.
[36:04] See very quickly how quickly in Genesis
[36:06] 4. And then you go on to Genesis 6 and
[36:08] you see just how uh uh debased mankind
[36:10] became. God's like, "Well, there's no
[36:12] way. You don't even have the nature of
[36:15] the original covenant. You don't have
[36:16] the image of the original covenant. I
[36:18] CAN'T IMPOSE THAT on you. it it required
[36:22] a new covenant.
[36:24] So now in Deuteronomy chapter 24
[36:34] remember how
[36:36] in ver Ephesians 5:29 for no man ever
[36:38] yet hated his own flesh. That was a very
[36:40] specific saying of Paul in the context
[36:42] of marriage that to a Jew he'd
[36:44] immediately knew exactly what he was
[36:46] referring to. The same would have been
[36:48] in the minds of them that said Moses
[36:50] then commanded us a writing of divorce.
[36:53] They they knew exactly what they they
[36:55] knew exactly what scroll that was in.
[36:58] It was it was actually probably just
[36:59] always open right like that was the one
[37:02] that they all knew by heart. Look, I can
[37:04] find it blind there. Yeah, it's told you
[37:06] it's there. There just it was kind of a
[37:08] little divot in the parchment from where
[37:11] everyone pointed to it. He says in
[37:13] Deuteronomy 24:1, "When a man hath taken
[37:15] a wife and married her, and it came to
[37:18] pass that she find no favor in his eyes,
[37:20] there's no grace.
[37:22] She's out of favor with him because he
[37:24] hath found some uncleanness in her. Then
[37:26] let him write her a bill of divorcement
[37:29] and give it to in her hand and send her
[37:31] out of his house." There's so much more
[37:32] here we could get into that would
[37:34] provoke a lot of good discussion, but
[37:36] we'll save it for ministers meetings.
[37:38] And he says, "And it came to pass that
[37:41] the husband marries a woman and he
[37:43] doesn't have any favor any fur more
[37:44] because he's found some uncleanness." We
[37:47] have to be very careful in reading this
[37:48] that we don't try to uh extract anything
[37:52] from this by way of this is what we're
[37:54] being instructed to or this is what's
[37:56] right or this is wrong. We can observe
[37:58] that this is just simply the case.
[38:01] And he says, and he let him write a bill
[38:03] of divorcement.
[38:05] So this is the bill of divorcement that
[38:09] Moses commanded them given a writing of
[38:10] divorcement that they're referring to.
[38:13] So we say then why did God allow this
[38:16] bill of divorcement? Why was it
[38:18] necessary? Why why would God say all
[38:21] right you married her and and then you
[38:24] you found this uncleanness and now you
[38:27] you're no longer happy with her. You
[38:28] know they have a favor with her then you
[38:30] can divorce her.
[38:33] Now to a
[38:36] to the Jews the breaking and I think
[38:39] this goes back even to the original sin
[38:41] uh even though it's maybe not explicit
[38:43] in a lot of the the the writings and
[38:45] their doctrine but breaking the marriage
[38:47] bond to a Jew breaking of the marriage
[38:50] bond was a sign and symptom of breaking
[38:52] the divine covenant
[38:54] that this is this is portrayed over and
[38:57] over again in God's dealing with Israel
[38:59] and they viewed the marriage covenant as
[39:02] being something holy
[39:03] and something of God and that if one was
[39:06] to break that there was a breaking of
[39:08] divi the divine covenant. So that's why
[39:11] they actually need some sort of explicit
[39:13] law to give them that liberty. And so
[39:17] Jesus gives us the answer why divorce is
[39:20] permitted given that it's a s symbolic
[39:22] of or even symptomatic of breaking the
[39:25] divine covenant. So the marriage bonds
[39:27] that are broken now can point back to
[39:30] the fall of man in the beginning.
[39:33] Jesus is saying that the reason why God
[39:35] allowed Moses to give us a rid of
[39:37] divorcement or allowed divorce is after
[39:40] the beginning God permitted it because
[39:42] the hardness of the man's heart says the
[39:45] hardness of your hearts suffered you to
[39:48] put away your wives. And so that's where
[39:51] the reason is behind this bill of
[39:54] divorcement.
[39:56] The hardness of hearts that means harsh,
[39:59] offensive, intolerable, impatient,
[40:02] unkind, illtempered, selfish. As a
[40:06] matter of fact, if you wanted to take
[40:07] the words that are used in hardness of
[40:09] hearts and compare it to charity, you'd
[40:11] find that it looks the opposite. Right?
[40:14] Because the hardness of your hearts.
[40:17] This is why he allowed it.
[40:20] Because you're impatient. You're unkind.
[40:22] You're selfish. You think evil. You're
[40:25] hard. You're harsh.
[40:27] In Deuteronomy 21:15, if a man have two
[40:30] wives, one loved and another hated.
[40:34] You'll find that as it leads up to
[40:36] Deuteronomy 24, the language that is
[40:38] used in the scripture is that when a man
[40:41] hated his wife, that's what gave him he
[40:43] was that's why he was looking for a
[40:45] reason to put her away. Deuteronomy
[40:47] 22:13, if any man take a wife and go
[40:49] unto her and hate her.
[40:53] SO EPHESIANS 5:21 29 IS pointing
[40:56] specifically to the condition OF MAN'S
[40:58] HEART TOWARDS HIS WIFE. No man ever yet
[41:01] hated his own flesh.
[41:04] And here he's saying, YOU GO BACK TO
[41:05] DEUTERONOMY. IT SAYS A MAN HATES his
[41:08] wife and if he hate her and the scriptur
[41:10] is bringing this up in the context of
[41:12] that marriage union when a man is no
[41:13] LONGER FAVORABLE TOWARDS HIS WIFE, IT'S
[41:15] THE hatred he has towards her. And and
[41:18] JESUS IS SAYING, WELL, A MAN DIVORCES
[41:20] because he hates.
[41:22] This is the condition after the fall
[41:24] that required a double covenant to
[41:26] govern that fallen nature.
[41:29] There is under the double covenant
[41:32] divorce.
[41:35] And brother Brandham says, now this is
[41:37] I'm just going to I'm going to move
[41:38] quickly on beyond this. I I'll just
[41:40] maybe summarize it.
[41:43] Brother Brandham says, "He can put us
[41:44] away for spiritual fornications and
[41:46] false doctrine anytime he wants to."
[41:50] Like any the double covenant.
[41:54] And if you're if you find that you find
[41:57] that well, let's we need to explain that
[41:58] a little bit more. Brother Aaron, in the
[42:01] beginning there was no sin under the
[42:03] original covenant.
[42:05] No fornication, no spiritual
[42:06] fornication, no adultery in the
[42:08] beginning. That's the original order.
[42:11] Now the woman after the fall, God
[42:13] institutes another covenant. So it's
[42:15] only then he's saying he can put you any
[42:17] way he wants, anytime he wants to.
[42:20] If you look at the history of Israel,
[42:22] Israel served God under the double
[42:23] covenant, desire and dominion.
[42:27] There was it was always it wasn't the
[42:29] respect and awe of a loving
[42:31] relationship. It was a fearful
[42:32] relationship of the all powerful God.
[42:34] Right?
[42:35] They as a matter of fact they just been
[42:37] studied on some things uh uh and how
[42:40] that in the Old Testament God was not
[42:42] known as a father
[42:44] as as some sort of literal loving kind
[42:48] relationship, a birthing relationship.
[42:49] He was the almighty God who created the
[42:51] heavens and the earth. And they would
[42:53] only refer to him in some sort of role,
[42:55] not in some sense that there was some
[42:56] sort of affinity and connection because
[42:58] they would when Jesus said he was the
[43:00] son of God, they said you've made
[43:01] yourself equal with God.
[43:02] Right?
[43:03] So they served him in that inequality,
[43:06] right?
[43:06] They served him under a double covenant.
[43:08] And God often raised that if you don't,
[43:10] I'll put you away. If you don't, I'll
[43:11] cause this. There was that that
[43:13] punishment under that double covenant.
[43:15] I'll say this, it's a mouthful, but I
[43:17] hope that maybe you could understand.
[43:18] And if the church I'll say the the
[43:21] church and if she's only the church, she
[43:23] serves God under this double covenant.
[43:25] That's all she is is a church. She
[43:27] serves God under the double covenant.
[43:30] But from the beginning, it wasn't. So
[43:33] this to me is one of the most important
[43:35] aspects and parts of marriage and
[43:37] divorce.
[43:38] From the beginning, this wasn't so. The
[43:40] original covenant of perfect love was
[43:41] governed by a divine power and a divine
[43:44] purpose. And it represented something
[43:46] and signified something to us. What we
[43:48] see now on the issue of marriage and
[43:50] divorce and remarage and all the
[43:52] subsequent problems that flow from it is
[43:54] not how it was in the beginning.
[43:58] It wasn't so from the beginning is what
[44:00] brother Brandham keeps bringing us back
[44:01] to over and over and over again. So, if
[44:05] you'll look at Ephesians chapter 5, 32
[44:08] and 33,
[44:11] I'd like to read um
[44:15] I'd like to read this
[44:17] and hopefully we could just keep
[44:19] referring back to some of these parts
[44:21] here.
[44:25] Paul says, "This is a great mystery.
[44:28] this mystery of this uh man shall leave
[44:33] members of his body of his flesh and his
[44:34] bones and they leave his father and
[44:36] mother be joined to his wife they shall
[44:38] be one flesh this is a great mystery
[44:40] and as just as they would have in
[44:43] Matthew chapter 19 saying okay my wife
[44:46] is and I are one flesh we're twin God
[44:48] has joined us together no man could put
[44:49] us aunder and they try to conceptualize
[44:51] that oneness Paul says this is a great
[44:54] mystery and and everybody could have
[44:56] been like you know like yeah I get it
[44:58] because I I when I look at my wife I see
[45:00] two but then he immediately says but I
[45:02] speak concerning Christ and the church
[45:05] so then it's like oh the mystery is the
[45:08] Christ and the church are to be one
[45:10] flesh
[45:11] self-same people
[45:12] just as Adam and the woman that's the
[45:14] mystery but Paul doesn't back off
[45:17] nevertheless even though I'm talking
[45:19] about Christ let every one of you in
[45:21] particular so love his wife even as
[45:24] himself
[45:26] Paul when he SAYS THIS IS A GREAT
[45:27] MYSTERY HE COULD HAVE BEEN LETTING US
[45:28] OFF THE HOOK. OH, when I was talking
[45:30] about one flesh, when I was talking
[45:31] about bone of bone, flesh of flesh and
[45:33] all that, I was talking about Christ and
[45:34] the church and everybody could have been
[45:35] like and and there could have been some
[45:38] sense of relief. He says, "But
[45:39] nevertheless, let every one of you IN
[45:41] PARTICULAR SO LOVE GOD SO LOVED THE
[45:43] WORLD. SO LOVED HIS WIFE EVEN AS HIMSELF
[45:46] as she is himself
[45:49] and the wife see that she reverence her
[45:50] husband." Amen.
[45:52] So when he says this is a great mystery
[45:54] and he says so therefore let every one
[45:55] of you in particular so love his wife.
[45:57] The mystery held love and wives
[46:00] reverence her husband. The mystery held
[46:01] reverence. And it's this mystery of true
[46:04] love and true reverence. How that the
[46:07] man OUGHT TO LOVE HIS WIFE AND HOW THAT
[46:08] SHE OUGHT TO REVERENCE THE HUSBAND. THIS
[46:10] IS A mystery that's acting in Adam and a
[46:13] mystery that's acting in Christ.
[46:16] Now I'm going to I'm going to go just
[46:19] point back to this very quickly in
[46:21] Genesis 3 6 to8 after the fall you'll
[46:26] find that the woman she acts
[46:27] independently of Adam with the serpent
[46:30] she then has this she has fallen she's
[46:34] broke the covenant already SO AS I
[46:37] PORTRAYED it in prayer and I'm very
[46:40] careful to try to paint this picture
[46:42] that maybe brother Brandham didn't
[46:43] explicitly paint but if you take it
[46:45] together with scripture and how he
[46:46] describes it. I I I I suggested could it
[46:50] be that the woman came to Adam in in the
[46:54] awareness of what she had done. And it
[46:57] says, "I've made a huge mistake because
[47:00] now she's feeling guilt. Now she's
[47:02] feeling shame." We we try to say, "Oh,
[47:04] she just must have been so lustful and
[47:06] it must have been so exciting for her."
[47:08] And she goes and runs and finds Adam.
[47:09] BUT COULD YOU IMAGINE PERHAPS THAT SHE
[47:12] FINDS HERSELF overwhelmed with this THIS
[47:15] THIS FEELING THAT SHE'S NEVER FELT
[47:17] BEFORE. AND IT'S NOT LIKE IN A
[47:19] PLEASURABLE WAY NOW. THIS IS AFTERWARDS
[47:21] WHERE IT'S MORE LIKE, "OH, WHAT HAVE I
[47:22] DONE? I HOW DID I GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT
[47:25] AND THE PAINS AND THE GUILT AND NOW THAT
[47:27] THE THE PASSION IS LEFT, SHE FINDS
[47:29] HERSELF PERHAPS GOING TO ADAM SAYING,
[47:30] "ADAM, I I I'VE MESSED UP. I'VE DONE
[47:33] SOMETHING WRONG. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
[47:34] DO. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS. THIS
[47:35] IS WHAT'S HAPPEN." AND ADAM MAY HAVE
[47:37] BEEN ABLE TO SEE THEN, BUT BECAUSE LOVE
[47:39] LOVE HAS THAT DISCERNMENT AND LOVE SAYS,
[47:41] "OH MY." AND IN THAT MOMENT, HE TAKES
[47:44] HER TO HIMSELF AND THEN THEY BEGIN TO
[47:47] ACT TOGETHER.
[47:49] As you read the scripture, Adam and his
[47:51] wife hid themselves.
[47:54] And here there the woman the the woman
[47:57] has just committed adultery against her
[47:59] husband. And Adam now IS STANDING
[48:02] STAYING BY HER SIDE. And you read these
[48:05] few verses, they themselves, they
[48:08] themselves, THEY'RE ALWAYS ACTING
[48:10] TOGETHER in that moment. Whatever they
[48:12] do, they do together. Even though they
[48:14] may be wrong, they're fleeing. They're
[48:15] dressing themselves. They're doing all
[48:16] these different things together. Adam
[48:18] remains there together with her.
[48:23] So the picture that you must I believe
[48:27] you must see this when brother Bam's
[48:30] telling us what Adam did and he acted in
[48:31] the image of Christ and he portrayed
[48:32] this and he took her to himself and he
[48:34] put his seed in her and all those things
[48:35] she should have been burned with the
[48:36] serpent all these things brother Bam
[48:38] says when the woman sinned when the
[48:41] WOMAN COMMITTED ADULTERY ADAM DID NOT
[48:43] PUT HER AWAY in divorce
[48:46] ADAM DID NOT SEPARATE from her
[48:49] ADAM DIDN'T GO SLEEPING IN ANOTHER
[48:51] VINEYARD.
[48:53] ADAM DID NOT ACT IN A WAY TO SAY, "WELL,
[48:56] you know what? I just need some time.
[48:59] You know, you I'll be with the
[49:00] giraffes."
[49:03] HE DOES NOT LEAVE HER TO BE CONDEMNED.
[49:08] WHAT ADAM DID IN the moment that she in
[49:11] the the moment that he realized she had
[49:14] BROKE HER COVENANT TO GOD AND HAD BROKE
[49:16] HER COVENANT TO HIM. WHEN HE'S FULLY
[49:18] AWARE AND HE'S FEELING THE WEIGHT OF A
[49:20] BROKEN COVENANT, ADAM ACTED QUICKLY to
[49:24] cleave to HER
[49:27] AND HE JOINED HIMSELF TO HER TO SAVE HER
[49:30] FROM CERTAIN DEATH. AMEN.
[49:32] SO WHEN THE WOMAN HAD BROKE HER COVENANT
[49:34] TO GOD AND BROKE HER COVENANT TO ADAM,
[49:37] WHAT ADAM DOES IN THAT MOMENT, AND I
[49:39] WANT TO SAY HE INSTINCTIVELY did this,
[49:41] he didn't say, "I just need some time. I
[49:43] need to figure this out. I need to work
[49:45] through this." He didn't have a bunch of
[49:46] questions. You know, where is he? I'm
[49:47] going to go get him. In his mind, he
[49:49] just immediately acts and he joins
[49:52] himself to her to save her from death.
[49:56] If I could say this, he redeemed her.
[50:01] Why did he redeem her?
[50:03] Because he's under the original
[50:04] covenant.
[50:06] Under the re original covenant, there's
[50:09] marriage, no divorce.
[50:12] Under the original covenant, it was a
[50:13] singular COVENANT THAT GOVERNED ADAM AND
[50:16] THE WOMAN AS ONE UNIT. And there was
[50:17] only marriage, no divorce.
[50:21] SO WHENEVER SHE BROKE THE COVENANT, ADAM
[50:24] ACTS ACCORDING TO THE COVENANT TO REDEEM
[50:27] HER. SHE BROKE THE COVENANT THROUGH
[50:30] UNFAITHFULNESS, but Adam WAS FAITHFUL TO
[50:33] THE COVENANT.
[50:36] IN OTHER WORDS, IF ADAM HAD DIVORCED
[50:38] HER, HE WOULD HAVE BROKE THE ORIGINAL
[50:41] COVENANT.
[50:43] HALLELUJAH. SHE WAS HIM.
[50:46] SO UNDER THE ORIGINAL MARRIAGE COVENANT,
[50:49] HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE OPTION TO
[50:52] DIVORCE HER. HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE
[50:54] RIGHT TO PUT HER AWAY. IF HE WOULD HAVE
[50:56] DONE IT, HE WOULD HAVE BROKE THE
[50:57] ORIGINAL COVENANT HIMSELF. [screaming]
[50:59] BUT UNDER THE ORIGINAL COVENANT, ADAM,
[51:02] WHO IS IN THE FIGURE OF CHRIST, BEEN
[51:04] FAITHFUL TO THE CLAUSE, TO THE LAW, TO
[51:07] THE LIFE, TO THE POWER OF THE ORIGINAL
[51:10] LOVE REDEEMED HER. AMEN.
[51:14] Divorce was not in the God's original
[51:16] world.
[51:18] IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT GOD LOVES.
[51:22] God didn't build it into the covenant
[51:26] because it what what followed is
[51:29] permissive.
[51:32] That's the that's the mystery of
[51:33] permissive will. What God permits, what
[51:36] God allows.
[51:39] But it was not. This wasn't so from the
[51:41] beginning. In Malachi 2:14-16, yet you
[51:45] say, "Wherefore, because the Lord hath
[51:46] been witness between thee and thy wife
[51:48] of thy youth." So there's the divine
[51:50] covenant
[51:52] against whom thou hast dealt
[51:54] treacherously.
[51:56] Yet she is thy companion and the wife of
[51:58] thy covenant.
[52:00] Malachi
[52:02] is speaking to hard hearts.
[52:06] And he says, 'The Lord has been a
[52:07] witness with your wife that you're
[52:10] mistreating, dealt treacherously with,
[52:13] wanting to go take other woman, put her
[52:15] away, take other woman, he says, she's
[52:17] your companion, the wife of thy
[52:18] covenant. And notice, and did not he
[52:21] make one?
[52:23] God ordained one man than one woman.
[52:26] Even though he HAD POWER TO MAKE MANY,
[52:28] this is what brother said in the
[52:29] beginning, one man, one woman. And he's
[52:31] saying this is this is what one man to
[52:33] one woman. This is the way it was in the
[52:34] beginning. one couple, one family. He
[52:36] ordained one male, one female, that he
[52:38] might have, as the scripture saying, did
[52:39] he not make one? Yet had he the residue
[52:42] of the spirit. And why one? Wherefore
[52:44] what? That he might seek a godly seed.
[52:47] This is holy offspring. This is the
[52:49] reason why that he did it this way. He's
[52:52] talking about that. It's that
[52:53] manifestation, the three-fold purpose of
[52:55] Christ or God in the beginning, in the
[52:57] man and the woman. So now Malachi when
[53:00] he's writing about men's attitudes
[53:02] towards their wives, he goes right back
[53:04] to the beginning. When Jesus has talked
[53:06] about marriage and divorce, he goes
[53:07] right back to the beginning. When Paul
[53:10] goes right back to the beginning, you
[53:11] see this theme now. It's going back to
[53:13] the original. Back to the original. He
[53:15] says, "Therefore, take heed to your
[53:17] spirit. Let none deal treacherously
[53:18] against the wife of his youth. For the
[53:21] Lord, the God of Israel saith that he
[53:22] hateth putting away.
[53:25] HE HATES DIVORCE.
[53:28] GOD hates divorce.
[53:31] For one coverth violence with his
[53:32] garment, sayeth the Lord of hosts.
[53:34] Therefore, take heed to your spirit that
[53:35] you deal not treacherously
[53:38] BECAUSE OF THIS IMAGE IN THE BEGINNING
[53:40] IN VERSE 15. God hates divorce. IT'S NOT
[53:43] IN HARMONY WITH GOD'S ORIGINAL COVENANT.
[53:46] Why did God LET US HAVE PERMIT US TO
[53:48] HAVE A A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT? WHY DID HE
[53:50] LET US PUT AWAY OUR WIVES? HE SAYS
[53:52] BECAUSE THE HARDNESS OF YOUR HEARTS, NOT
[53:53] BECAUSE THE HARDNESS OF HIS HEART,
[53:55] not because he's cruel. Not because he's
[53:58] impatient. It's because of YOU HE DID
[54:00] IT. THIS ISN'T HOW GOD SAW THINGS IN THE
[54:02] BEGINNING.
[54:05] God desired one family in agreement in
[54:07] harmony, one flesh, ONE SPIRIT, ONE
[54:08] LIFE. That's how God envisioned it in
[54:10] the beginning.
[54:12] So when we read in Ephesians 5 and we
[54:15] start with verse 25, husbands, love your
[54:17] wives even as Christ loved the church.
[54:19] He says, gave himself for it. They might
[54:20] sanctify it, cleanse it. So ought to men
[54:22] to love their wives as their own body.
[54:24] And he says, and he says that as the
[54:26] Lord the church, we are members of his
[54:28] body, his bones, his flesh. This cause
[54:30] shall a man leave his father. There
[54:32] should be one flesh. This is a great
[54:33] mystery. I speak of Christ in church. He
[54:34] says, "Nevertheless, let every one of
[54:35] you in so particular love his wife."
[54:40] Do you recognize what Paul has done in
[54:41] this instance? Paul tells husbands to
[54:43] love their wives under the original
[54:44] covenant,
[54:46] not under the double covenant. Right?
[54:48] He's not he's not looking uh when he
[54:50] says this when he says this he said
[54:52] Christ is the example husband Adam who
[54:55] patterned Christ in Romans 5:14 that
[54:57] there who is in the figure of him that
[54:58] is to come said that husbands love your
[55:01] wives as Christ loved the church the
[55:03] head is the savior the deliverer the
[55:05] preserver the one that keeps safe and
[55:06] sound the one who uses tender care he
[55:09] gives himself over his wife he allows
[55:11] himself to be USED FOR HER HE SACRIFICES
[55:14] HIMSELF FOR HE'S THE SANCTIFIER TO
[55:16] SEPARATE FROM profane things to
[55:18] consecrate from things that spoil and
[55:20] harm. He is the sanctifier.
[55:22] So if there's any profane thing, if
[55:24] there's any hurtful thing, he
[55:25] consecrates her from the spoil and harm.
[55:27] He's a cleanser. HE SETS FREE FROM
[55:29] WICKEDNESS. HE GUIDES IT FROM FAULTS AND
[55:31] MISTAKES.
[55:33] THIS WHEN BROTHER WHEN PAUL IS TELLING
[55:34] HUSBANDS TO LOVE THEIR WIVES, HE POINTS
[55:36] TO CHRIST and and IN DOING SO, HE'S ALSO
[55:39] POINTING TO ADAM. HE SAYS THIS IS HOW
[55:41] CHRIST LOVES THE CHURCH. HE'S A
[55:43] SANCTIFIER.
[55:44] HE'S A PURGGER. HE'S A CLEANSER. HE HE'S
[55:46] THE giver
[55:48] and and HE SAID THIS IS THIS IS WHAT HOW
[55:50] CHRIST LOVES THE CHURCH. HE SAYS THIS IS
[55:53] this this is how you ought to LOVE UNDER
[55:54] THE ORIGINAL COVENANT. AND UNDER THE
[55:56] ORIGINAL COVENANT IT'S ALL IT HAD UNDER
[55:58] THE ORIGINAL COVENANT. THERE WAS ONE
[56:00] CONDITION perfect love.
[56:03] Unconditional perfect love.
[56:06] And so Paul's marriage counseling, if I
[56:08] could kind of uh summarize it this way,
[56:10] it's not according to Deuteronomy 24.
[56:12] Amen.
[56:13] He's not uh turn in your Bibles to
[56:15] Deuteronomy 21:22 and let's read verse
[56:16] 24 20 chapter 24. He is not counseling
[56:20] according to Deuteronomy 24 or hate.
[56:23] But he's actually counting counseling
[56:25] according to Genesis chapter 1 and two
[56:26] love.
[56:28] He's not he's not counseling in light of
[56:30] hate.
[56:31] He's not saying well because hard hearts
[56:33] I get it. I know how this happens. I
[56:34] know through time and things just happen
[56:36] and there's misunderstandings and
[56:37] eventually it just kind of breeds
[56:38] contempt and you're no longer happy to
[56:40] be together. You know who wants a home
[56:41] like that? And besides a woman and uh
[56:43] you know an angry woman and a railing
[56:44] woman is kind of like a dripping faucet
[56:46] and you know better to live in a small
[56:47] house and they start pulling you from
[56:49] everywhere and saying I get it guys come
[56:50] on look just you can leave her.
[56:56] He doesn't do that.
[56:58] He counels from Genesis chapter 1 and
[57:00] two. Paul is pointing to and drawing
[57:03] from the original marriage covenant when
[57:05] he says husbands love your wives. He's
[57:07] drawing from and and pointing us to the
[57:10] original marriage covenant when he says,
[57:11] "So love your wives."
[57:14] And this is exactly what Jesus did when
[57:16] the issue of divorce came up. He quoted
[57:18] the original.
[57:21] Notice how Paul counsels in 1
[57:23] Corinthians chapter 7:es 10-15.
[57:28] I know these scriptures oftentimes raise
[57:29] more questions just in the reading of
[57:32] it, but I think there's some things we
[57:33] can take away. And unto the married, I
[57:36] command, yet not I, but the Lord. This
[57:38] is the Lord's commandment. Let not the
[57:40] wife depart from her husband.
[57:43] But if she depart, let her remain
[57:44] unmarried or be reconciled to her
[57:46] husband. So, it's telling you this is
[57:48] the Lord.
[57:49] These are the only options. He says,
[57:53] "And let not the husband put away his
[57:56] wife."
[57:59] This is the Lord saying it. Yes.
[58:01] So we could read this to the married I
[58:04] command you tonight. Let not the wife
[58:05] depart from her husband. He's not he
[58:06] doesn't want the separation. But if she
[58:07] depart, she needs to remade unmarried
[58:10] or she can be reconciled to her husband.
[58:11] He says but don't let the husband
[58:12] divorce his wife. This is not me. Paul
[58:15] is saying this is the Lord. The husband
[58:17] don't divorce your wife. So but to the
[58:19] rest speak I not the Lord. If any
[58:21] brother hath a wife that believeth not
[58:23] and she be pleased to dwell with him,
[58:24] let him not put her away. Don't divorce
[58:27] her. And the woman which hath a husband
[58:29] that believeth not and if he be pleased
[58:31] to dwell with her let her not leave him.
[58:33] And and I know that if you read that
[58:35] it's pretty explicit that the man is the
[58:37] one that divorces. The woman can only
[58:39] leave.
[58:40] Says and the unbelieving husband. This
[58:43] is why he says this. For the unbelieving
[58:46] husband is sanctified by the wife and
[58:47] the unbelieving wife is sanctified by by
[58:48] the husband. Else were your children
[58:50] unclean but now they are clean. Now they
[58:52] are holy.
[58:54] THAT'S THE POWER OF MARRIAGE. THAT'S THE
[58:56] BEAUTY OF MARRIAGE.
[58:58] So he says, "BUT IF THE UNBELIEVING
[58:59] DEPART, let them depart." He says, "And
[59:00] a brother, sister's not under bondage in
[59:02] such ca such cases, but God hath called
[59:04] us to peace." That there ought not to be
[59:06] any condemnation in the instance that
[59:08] the unbelieving would depart and it
[59:10] happens, then you you can have peace.
[59:13] God will not lay that to your charge.
[59:14] You do not need to be condemned by that.
[59:16] Paul is giving being given this great uh
[59:20] privilege to say you can continue as you
[59:22] are. Don't worry. Don't live in fear.
[59:25] You can go on.
[59:27] He's not saying that they're no longer
[59:28] bound uh by that original marriage and
[59:31] by their vows. He just says you're not
[59:32] you're not condemned by this.
[59:35] So guess what Paul is what is he not
[59:38] selling in these verses.
[59:40] He's not selling divorce.
[59:42] As a solution, but he's actually quoting
[59:45] God is saying don't divorce.
[59:48] And brother Brandham does the same
[59:49] thing.
[59:51] He's doing the same thing. Now, this is
[59:54] going to be maybe a an acceleration of
[59:56] thoughts here,
[59:58] but if I can say this, and I want to
[1:00:00] prove this statement by the the message.
[1:00:02] Brother Bram does the same thing that
[1:00:04] Paul does, the same thing that Christ
[1:00:06] does that when the issue is raised,
[1:00:09] Christ goes, "Oh, we'll go back to the
[1:00:11] beginning." Malachi, when he's dealing
[1:00:13] with the issue, goes back to the
[1:00:15] beginning.
[1:00:16] Paul, when he deals with the issue, goes
[1:00:18] back to the beginning. Brother Brandon,
[1:00:20] when he deals with the issue, goes back
[1:00:22] to the beginning.
[1:00:23] And can I just say this before I go any
[1:00:25] further? Isn't it wonderful that that
[1:00:26] ministry restores the heart?
[1:00:29] Turns the heart away from hardness and
[1:00:32] harshness and bitterness and selfishness
[1:00:33] and unkindness. That's what this word is
[1:00:35] supposed to do.
[1:00:37] But after the seals are open, we're
[1:00:39] brought back to in the beginning
[1:00:41] where it was where he says from the
[1:00:44] beginning it wasn't so. So he's wanting
[1:00:45] to bring us back to the beginning. So
[1:00:47] whatever that was can be. So
[1:00:48] yes, Amen.
[1:00:51] We are, I believe we already recognize
[1:00:52] and see that the original covenant had
[1:00:54] been lost. That's where the double
[1:00:56] covenants instituted. Different
[1:00:58] covenants exist. But when the word has
[1:01:00] been restored to us, the original
[1:01:02] covenant's being restored.
[1:01:04] And the sermon thinking man's filter,
[1:01:05] brother says, "Oh, for the grace of
[1:01:07] God," this is in August of 65, that he
[1:01:09] would give us understanding of such
[1:01:11] great mysteries.
[1:01:13] And I know we're thinking
[1:01:15] the the mysteries of, you know, the the
[1:01:19] logistics of the mighty angel coming
[1:01:20] down
[1:01:23] and the other mysteries we might think
[1:01:24] of. But he says as Paul spoke here
[1:01:25] further down in Ephesians, speaking of
[1:01:26] the husband and wife, and said this is a
[1:01:28] mystery, how the woman should be in
[1:01:30] respects to their husband.
[1:01:32] He's identifying the relationship
[1:01:34] between the man and the woman and the
[1:01:36] love and the respect that they have for
[1:01:37] each other as a mystery.
[1:01:39] And I would say, "Oh, what a great
[1:01:41] mystery that's been revealed of the true
[1:01:43] love and reverence that ought to exist
[1:01:45] in a marriage."
[1:01:46] Amen.
[1:01:46] In the sermon in third Exodus, he says,
[1:01:48] "I want to explain the real truth of
[1:01:49] marriage and divorce." It's a question
[1:01:52] and this is the last hours when all the
[1:01:55] mysteries of God should be finished.
[1:01:58] So he refers to the the mystery the the
[1:02:02] understand of such great mysteries and
[1:02:04] he refers to Ephesians 5. Now he says
[1:02:06] the truth of marriage and divorce is
[1:02:08] part of the mysteries of God that should
[1:02:09] be finished. Then in marriage and
[1:02:11] divorce he says now on the marriage and
[1:02:14] divorce it has to be revealed. Until
[1:02:17] it's revealed you don't know it.
[1:02:19] But he promised in this last days in
[1:02:22] this age that every hidden mystery in
[1:02:24] the Bible would be revealed.
[1:02:26] How many knows that? Revelations the
[1:02:27] 10th chapter
[1:02:29] the mystery of one flesh.
[1:02:31] Every mystery shall be revealed. A
[1:02:33] marriage and divorce. He says he's
[1:02:34] promised that he the hidden mystery in
[1:02:36] the Bible would be revealed. And he goes
[1:02:37] it's Revelation the 10th chapter. So
[1:02:40] Revelations 10:es 1-7 as we would could
[1:02:44] read it and we would see the way it's
[1:02:46] symbolically represented in scripture.
[1:02:47] He's saying that PROMISES TO ANSWER THE
[1:02:51] QUESTION OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.
[1:02:53] THAT PROMISES TO GIVE US UNDERSTANDING
[1:02:55] OF THIS MYSTERY OF A woman being in
[1:02:57] respect to her husband.
[1:03:00] And I and WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS I
[1:03:03] believe at the open of the word I I I'm
[1:03:05] I'm putting it in my words now. I
[1:03:07] believe that at the open of the word the
[1:03:09] truth of marriage and divorce is being
[1:03:11] restored. That the truth of this great
[1:03:13] mystery is being restored. I believe
[1:03:15] that at the open of the word we're able
[1:03:17] TO KNOW WHAT THAT DOUBLE COVENANT IS AND
[1:03:19] WHY IT EXISTS. BUT THEN WE'RE ALSO ABLE
[1:03:21] TO KNOW BY REVELATION THAT THE ORIGINAL
[1:03:24] COVENANT MUST BE RESTORED. AMEN.
[1:03:27] And so, Brother Brandham uses the phrase
[1:03:29] phrase marriage covenant three times.
[1:03:31] Leave all of them after the seals are
[1:03:32] opened in weddings. He says, "I shall
[1:03:35] propose to you the marriage covenant."
[1:03:38] And I believe that's exactly what
[1:03:40] brother Brandham was doing from 63 on to
[1:03:42] 65. I shall propose to you the marriage
[1:03:45] covenant.
[1:03:46] The revelation of the son of man is a
[1:03:48] union between Christ and his bride. I
[1:03:50] propose to you the marriage covenant.
[1:03:51] I'm no longer going to call you church,
[1:03:54] but I'm going to call you bride. So that
[1:03:55] you understand, I now propose to you the
[1:03:57] marriage covenant. You're not just one
[1:03:59] that's been a spouse. YOU'RE NOT SERVING
[1:04:01] under the double covenant. I'm not
[1:04:02] proposing to you that you're still in
[1:04:04] this state of fear. I'M TRYING TO GET
[1:04:06] YOU AWAY FROM ALL the fear and scare.
[1:04:08] This is the language THAT HE'S USING. HE
[1:04:09] WAS A SON OF MAN revealing the son of
[1:04:11] man, SAYING, "I NOW PROPOSE TO YOU THE
[1:04:14] MARRIAGE COVENANT." WHY? THE MARRIAGE
[1:04:16] COVENANT WAS BEING CONFIRMED.
[1:04:18] At the opening OF THE SEALS, CHRIST THE
[1:04:20] MIGHTY ANGEL COMES DOWN WITH THE RAINBOW
[1:04:22] ON HIS HEAD. WHAT IS HE? HE'S THE
[1:04:24] COVENANT ANGEL
[1:04:26] DESCENDING WITH AN OPEN BOOK. THE
[1:04:28] ORIGINAL COVENANT.
[1:04:30] THAT'S REVELATIONS 10:1. THAT'S THE
[1:04:32] REVELATION THE 10TH CHAPTER. THAT'S THE
[1:04:34] MYSTERY PART OF THE MYSTERIES THAT are
[1:04:35] being fulfilled.
[1:04:36] The mighty angel with the rainbow upon
[1:04:38] his head is THE MESSENGER OF THE
[1:04:40] unconditional covenant.
[1:04:41] He's not A MESSENGER OF DEUTERONOMY 24.
[1:04:44] HE'S NOT A MESSENGER OF THE DOUBLE
[1:04:45] COVENANT. HE'S NOT A MESSENGER OF HE
[1:04:47] CAN. SHE CAN. HE'S A MESSENGER OF THE
[1:04:50] ORIGINAL COVENANT.
[1:04:53] And he's restoring to the bride her
[1:04:54] secret covenant.
[1:04:56] Bill Ram says, "The secret's been made
[1:04:57] known. The seals are opened."
[1:04:59] Amen.
[1:05:01] The secret of the Lord is with them that
[1:05:02] fear him. And he will show them his
[1:05:04] covenant.
[1:05:05] The secret of the Lord is with his wife.
[1:05:08] Amen.
[1:05:08] Because the mystery is how the wife
[1:05:10] should be in reverence to her husband to
[1:05:11] fear her husband. That's not the fear
[1:05:13] that the woman has in Deuteronomy 24 of
[1:05:15] her husband.
[1:05:16] It's the fear and the the love that the
[1:05:18] woman would have had in the beginning.
[1:05:20] that respect and that desire that was
[1:05:22] one and co-equal. And he says to my
[1:05:24] wife, to her that fears me, I will show
[1:05:27] my covenant.
[1:05:30] Brother Bandam in the sermon marriage
[1:05:31] and divorce is you've got to come back
[1:05:33] to the truth to find out what it is.
[1:05:36] It's always been that way. That's the
[1:05:38] regular covenant with God from the
[1:05:40] beginning. First, before the beginning,
[1:05:44] from the beginning, there was just one
[1:05:46] and one.
[1:05:49] Are you are are you thinking about it?
[1:05:52] Think about the implications in this.
[1:05:55] There was just one and one. After the
[1:05:57] sin came in, then there was one man and
[1:05:58] a bunch of women. Run that way in
[1:06:00] nature. Every animal and human beings
[1:06:01] and natural flesh is animal. We're
[1:06:02] mammal. We know that. All of us. See,
[1:06:04] and it's all God's nature AND
[1:06:06] CONTINUITY. BUT NOW THAT THE SEALS ARE
[1:06:09] OPENED,
[1:06:10] THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH DIRECTS us to the
[1:06:13] word. Amen.
[1:06:14] Now, IF WE COULD SAY THIS, NOW THAT THE
[1:06:16] SEALS ARE OPEN, THIS IS THE WAY THAT
[1:06:18] IT'S SET IN SECONDARILY IN NATURE BY
[1:06:20] SEX. THIS IS THE WAY THAT it has BEEN
[1:06:22] BECAUSE OF THE FALL. BUT NOW THAT THE
[1:06:24] SEALS ARE OPENED,
[1:06:26] WE SEE WHAT THE ORIGINAL COVENANT WAS.
[1:06:28] WE SEE THE DOUBLE COVENANT. AND HE SAYS
[1:06:30] THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH DIRECTS US TO THE
[1:06:32] WORD.
[1:06:34] It's directed us to the beginning. IT'S
[1:06:36] DIRECTED US TO HOW IT WAS IN THE
[1:06:37] BEGINNING. THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH DIRECTS
[1:06:39] US TO THE WORD. AND HE SAYS THAT
[1:06:41] EXPLAINS WHY ALL THE MISTAKES HAVE been
[1:06:42] made through the ages.
[1:06:45] BECAUSE THE SEALS WAS NOT OPENED. THIS
[1:06:47] WAS NOT REVEALED. IT'S TRUE.
[1:06:50] THE REASON WHY MISTAKES ARE MADE IS
[1:06:53] BECAUSE the seals weren't opened. THE
[1:06:55] REASON WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW AND DIDN'T
[1:06:56] UNDERSTAND AND WENT OFF AND DID CERTAIN
[1:06:58] THINGS THAT THEY DID IS BECAUSE THE
[1:07:00] SEALS WERE NOT OPEN. THIS WAS NOT
[1:07:01] REVEALED.
[1:07:03] AND HE'S SAYING UNDER THE DOUBLE
[1:07:04] COVENANT THERE IS DIVORCE. BUT UNDER THE
[1:07:07] ORIGINAL COVENANT,
[1:07:09] HE HE CLEARLY TELLS US ON THE ISSUE OF
[1:07:12] MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE. IN THE BEGINNING,
[1:07:14] GOD INSTITUTED MARRIAGE. THERE WAS NO
[1:07:17] DIVORCE. It is in the INSTITUTION OF THE
[1:07:20] SEC THE DOUBLE COVENANTS THAT FROM THEN
[1:07:22] ON HE SET IN THE SECOND covenant
[1:07:25] and now there was double covenants in
[1:07:27] the fall. So in the original covenant
[1:07:29] there's no divorce, just redemption.
[1:07:33] Amen.
[1:07:34] Under a church covenant there's divorce.
[1:07:37] But under the bride age covenant, under
[1:07:39] a church age covenant, there's divorce.
[1:07:41] But under the bride age covenant,
[1:07:43] there's only redemption.
[1:07:46] You want to know why we're still here?
[1:07:48] Because he can't put us away and try to
[1:07:50] do something else.
[1:07:52] Can't do it.
[1:07:54] Why are we still here? Unconditional.
[1:07:57] UNCONDITIONAL LOVE THERE. WHY WILL THERE
[1:07:59] NOT BE ANOTHER AGE TO THIS?
[1:08:01] WHY WILL THERE NOT BE ANOTHER CYCLE? WHY
[1:08:03] WILL HE NOT SEND ANOTHER PROPHET? WHY?
[1:08:06] BECAUSE HE'S RESTORED THE ORIGINAL
[1:08:08] MARRIAGE COVENANT. AND JUST AS ADAM DID
[1:08:11] WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO REDEEM THE WOMAN,
[1:08:13] CHRIST DOES WHAT'S NECESSARY TO SAVE
[1:08:17] [screaming]
[1:08:17] HIS WIFE.
[1:08:21] In the sermon marriage and divorce, he
[1:08:22] says he could put her away, but she
[1:08:24] cannot put him away. He's talking about
[1:08:25] the church. He did it. has proved it in
[1:08:27] the days of Luther, Wesley, and
[1:08:28] Pentecost when they refused to become
[1:08:30] the further part of him by having
[1:08:32] spiritual sexual affair to become
[1:08:33] pregnant with the further part of the
[1:08:35] word. I know that's a mouthful. It's
[1:08:37] quite quite a statement.
[1:08:39] He's saying he could put Luther Wesley
[1:08:41] and Pentecost away. But upon the
[1:08:44] restoration of the original marriage
[1:08:45] covenant, something changes.
[1:08:48] He says, "And so it is with the church
[1:08:49] that refuses to become pregnant in the
[1:08:51] age that we live in now to bring forth
[1:08:53] children of this age." says, "We are not
[1:08:55] Lutheran. We are not Wesley's. Neither
[1:08:58] are we Pentecostals."
[1:09:00] He puts them away.
[1:09:02] THOSE ARE THE CHURCHES UNDER THE DOUBLE
[1:09:04] COVENANT. BUT WE ARE NOT LUTHER. WE ARE
[1:09:07] NOT WESLEY. WE ARE NOT PENTECOSTAL.
[1:09:10] WE'RE THE BRIDE.
[1:09:13] He says, "WE'VE GOT TO BE THE CHILDREN
[1:09:14] OF THIS AGE THROUGH THE PREGNANCY OF THE
[1:09:15] WORD of God to BRING FORTH THE CHILD OF
[1:09:17] THIS AGE, THE SEED OF THE CHILD." DO YOU
[1:09:19] NOT SEE WHAT CHRIST IS DOING IN THE END
[1:09:21] TIME? HE'S DOING EXACTLY WHAT ADAM DID.
[1:09:24] HE'S REDEEMING US.
[1:09:26] HE'S KEEPING US.
[1:09:29] This is the blessing of the ORIGINAL
[1:09:30] MARRIAGE COVENANT. IT'S UNCONDITIONAL.
[1:09:33] IT'S WHAT HE EXPRESSES in Abraham.
[1:09:36] Unconditional.
[1:09:38] ABRAHAM, I WILL DO THIS FOR YOU.
[1:09:43] ADAM, if you made a mistake, Adam, this
[1:09:44] is what happens. He He made these
[1:09:46] conditional covenants. But with Abraham,
[1:09:48] he wants to express something. Abraham,
[1:09:50] look, no matter what you do, e even if
[1:09:51] with Hagar, doesn't matter if you doubt,
[1:09:53] you do all these different things. You
[1:09:54] lie, you try to save your own life. No
[1:09:56] matter what, doesn't matter. I'll make
[1:09:57] it happen.
[1:09:58] I'm I'm just going to do it. Doesn't
[1:10:00] matter.
[1:10:05] And so, what does God do in this hour?
[1:10:07] He says, "We're not Lutheran. We're not
[1:10:08] Wesleys. We're not Pentecostals. We're
[1:10:10] not We are not them.
[1:10:12] And we're not like the woman.
[1:10:15] We're not like Eve."
[1:10:18] Why? Why in this age, in this time, what
[1:10:21] is it Christ? What is this great mystery
[1:10:23] brothers referring to that Paul refers
[1:10:24] to? Christ cannot hate his own flesh.
[1:10:29] He cannot deny her. He cannot reject
[1:10:30] her. He cannot look for another one.
[1:10:33] Therefore, for us as the bride of Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ, this is perfect love. There's no
[1:10:39] fear of divorce.
[1:10:42] There's no fear of banishment. When the
[1:10:44] HEADSTONE WHICH IS CHRIST, WHICH IS THE
[1:10:46] HEART OF GOD, WHICH IS THE LOVE of God,
[1:10:48] WHICH IS PERFECT LOVE, which is charity,
[1:10:50] when the headstone is being revealed to
[1:10:52] us, it comes with shines of grace. Grace
[1:10:55] until we come into the perfection. IT'S
[1:10:57] GRACE UPON GRACE UNTIL WE COME INTO
[1:10:59] PERFECTION. THAT WE CANNOT BE SAID OF
[1:11:02] CHRIST THAT WHEN HE MARRIES YOU, YOU
[1:11:04] FALL OUT OF FAVOR WITH HER. THAT'S WHY
[1:11:06] THERE'S AN INVISIBLE UNION. YOU CANNOT
[1:11:08] FALL OUT OF FAVOR WITH HIM. IT'S GRACE
[1:11:10] AFTER GRACE AFTER GRACE.
[1:11:13] HE'LL DO IT UNTIL PERFECT LOVE COMES.
[1:11:16] DIVINE LOVE HAS BEEN PROJECTED.
[1:11:18] SOVEREIGN GRACE HAS TAKE IT TOOK ITS
[1:11:19] PLACE AND IT WILL PRODUCE PERFECT LOVE.
[1:11:23] THERE IS NO FEAR. LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:11:25] GET AWAY FROM IT. I WANT YOU AS
[1:11:27] INDIVIDUAL BELIEVERS TODAY FOR ONCE AND
[1:11:30] FOR ALL. BURY THAT UNBELIEF. BURY THAT
[1:11:34] FEAR. HE CANNOT PUT YOU AWAY.
[1:11:40] She couldn't get scared. That's what he
[1:11:42] says about the woman. She couldn't get
[1:11:43] scared. There's nothing to get scared
[1:11:44] about. She had perfect love.
[1:11:50] And so, what what about my first
[1:11:51] husband? He's dead.
[1:11:55] Think about all the things that this
[1:11:56] message is teaching us.
[1:12:00] Look at the woman. Oh, but I I made a
[1:12:02] mistake. I I was fallen. I I I I've
[1:12:04] sinned. Okay, I can redeem you.
[1:12:08] That's what's reflected.
[1:12:11] And if I could say this in closing, I
[1:12:13] know you thought I was going to be long.
[1:12:16] I just I wanted to get to Lubies before
[1:12:18] it closed.
[1:12:22] This is the covenant that our marriage
[1:12:24] should be marriages should be under.
[1:12:27] I know that's a that's a mouthful.
[1:12:30] This is the covenant that our marriages
[1:12:32] should aspire to. Not a double covenant.
[1:12:36] We shouldn't we shouldn't have the
[1:12:38] sermon marriage and divorced all
[1:12:40] highlighted and dogeared and everything
[1:12:42] kind of saved so that we could come come
[1:12:44] and say he can she can't. What about the
[1:12:46] other message that's in that?
[1:12:49] What about what about the other image?
[1:12:52] The he can she can't. That's because
[1:12:53] hardness of hearts.
[1:12:55] The he can't she can't. That's under the
[1:12:57] that's under the double covenant.
[1:12:59] This this is this is under the covenant
[1:13:01] of hate. That's under the covenant of
[1:13:03] unfaithfulness.
[1:13:06] But this is the covenant. The original
[1:13:07] marriage covenant is the covenant that
[1:13:08] our our marriages should aspire to.
[1:13:11] Amen.
[1:13:11] Is it not the original marriage covenant
[1:13:13] that we find ourselves quoting? I
[1:13:14] promise to love to honor cherish and
[1:13:16] sickness or health rich or poor as long
[1:13:18] as we both shall live.
[1:13:21] Isn't isn't it that the two shall let
[1:13:23] what God joined together? Let let no man
[1:13:25] put us under is the very declaration
[1:13:27] that's set over us in our marriage
[1:13:28] ceremonies. It's not under Deuteronomy.
[1:13:31] It's it's under the original. It's from
[1:13:34] Ephesians 5. It's from Genesis 1 and2.
[1:13:36] It's from the words of Christ. IT'S FROM
[1:13:38] THE THINGS THAT ALL POINT US BACK to the
[1:13:40] beginning.
[1:13:42] And and and AND OUR MARRIAGE COVENANT,
[1:13:44] OUR MARRIAGE VOWS. IT'S NOT THAT UH I
[1:13:46] PROMISE TO BE FAITHFUL to you until I
[1:13:48] hate you and then I'm just going to
[1:13:49] leave you.
[1:13:51] And that would make more SENSE UNDER THE
[1:13:52] OLD TESTAMENT makes more sense IN THE
[1:13:54] DOUBLE COVENANT. WE'RE NOT EVEN DRAWING
[1:13:56] IT FROM EVEN CORINTHIANS WHERE HE SAYS,
[1:13:57] "YOU KNOW WHAT? IF SHE wants to leave
[1:13:58] and says, well, I promise to always
[1:14:00] remain a believer. If my life wife
[1:14:01] becomes an unbeliever and she doesn't
[1:14:03] want to live with me, then let her
[1:14:04] depart. THAT'S NOT THE VOW WE GIVE AT
[1:14:06] OUR WEDDING DAY.
[1:14:08] IT'S ALL DRAWING FROM THE ORIGINAL
[1:14:09] MARRIAGE COVENANT. THESE VOWS OF OUR
[1:14:12] MARRIAGES THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN UNITED
[1:14:13] UNDER DRAW FROM THE COVENANT IN THE
[1:14:15] BEGINNING. AND IT OUGHT TO INSPIRE US TO
[1:14:18] PERFECT LOVE.
[1:14:22] The opening of the seals, the opening of
[1:14:24] the word should completely change our
[1:14:26] attitudes towards our marriages.
[1:14:27] Amen.
[1:14:29] Because I believe that as much as the
[1:14:31] third pool has this side to it that is
[1:14:38] mysterious and rich and deep and pulls
[1:14:42] from all these different areas and you
[1:14:43] see even dates and times and numerology
[1:14:45] shadows and types that there's this
[1:14:46] whole area of of things that is that uh
[1:14:51] I don't want to say anything to diminish
[1:14:52] it at all because when I hear it
[1:14:54] preached well I get giddy and I love it
[1:14:57] just the same as you
[1:14:58] But the third pull is for the
[1:15:01] preservation of our marriages,
[1:15:04] for the sanctification of our families.
[1:15:06] That's that's what the third pool is
[1:15:08] for.
[1:15:08] When he when he's introducing to us the
[1:15:10] marriage covenant, I under under the
[1:15:13] sermon marriage and divorce, he's saying
[1:15:15] in the beginning it was marriage without
[1:15:16] divorce.
[1:15:18] The reason why we have marriage and
[1:15:19] divorce today is because of the fall.
[1:15:21] But now the spirit of truth directs us
[1:15:23] to the word. Now he's restored us back
[1:15:25] to an Eden condition. Now the messenger
[1:15:28] of the covenant is here reaffirming his
[1:15:30] love for us. He puts us in this state of
[1:15:32] comfort and no scare, no fear. If that's
[1:15:35] what he can do for us, if that's what he
[1:15:37] can do in our own PERSONAL LIVES, COULD
[1:15:39] IT not give us a reservoir of love?
[1:15:41] Could it not give us a reservoir of
[1:15:43] healing bomb for our marriages? LISTEN,
[1:15:45] I DO NOT BELIEVE I DON'T CARE HOW MANY
[1:15:47] YEARS YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED. I DON'T CARE
[1:15:49] HOW MUCH PAIN, HOW MUCH IN AND OUT, HOW
[1:15:51] MANY THINGS HAVE TRANSPIRED. I BELIEVE
[1:15:53] THE POWER OF THE REDEMPTIVE WORD. AND I
[1:15:56] BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF CHRIST THAT HAS
[1:15:59] BEEN REVEALED IN THIS END TIME. AND IT
[1:16:00] IS THE POWER OF RESTORATION. IT IS THE
[1:16:02] POWER OF HEALING. IT IS THE POWER OF
[1:16:04] REDEMPTION. AND THERE IS A PERFECT LOVE
[1:16:07] HERE THAT CAN REDEEM,
[1:16:09] THAT CAN RESTORE, THAT CAN HEAL,
[1:16:16] and this statement to me just becomes
[1:16:19] such a
[1:16:22] a an anchor in marriage and divorce. He
[1:16:25] said, "God gave us a remedy and a way to
[1:16:28] marry our wives and live with them,
[1:16:31] but God but man won't accept God's
[1:16:33] remedy. Won't accept his word on it."
[1:16:37] What does that sound like to you?
[1:16:40] God gave us a remedy.
[1:16:42] And a way to marry our wives and live
[1:16:44] with them.
[1:16:46] He gives us a remedy.
[1:16:48] AND MAN WON'T ACCEPT GOD'S REMEDY. WON'T
[1:16:51] accept God's word on it. I know
[1:16:53] situations are unique. I I I know that
[1:16:56] in preaching this even a maybe a
[1:16:58] minister could challenge me and say,
[1:16:59] "Oh, are you saying that we can no
[1:17:01] longer a wife can no longer be
[1:17:03] divorced?" I say the double covenant is
[1:17:05] still in effect.
[1:17:07] The double covenant is STILL IN EFFECT.
[1:17:09] IT STILL exists today. AND I'M I AM NOT
[1:17:12] SAYING THAT THAT IS CLOSED. I'M NOT
[1:17:14] CHANGING WHAT BROTHER TAUGHT. IT STANDS
[1:17:16] JUST THE SAME AS IT WAS WHEN HE PREACHED
[1:17:18] IT. BUT I WANT YOU TO RECOGNIZE THE
[1:17:21] OTHER THEME TO THIS SERMON. GOD GAVE US
[1:17:24] A REMEDY.
[1:17:25] HOW TO MARRY OUR WIVES AND LIVE WITH
[1:17:27] THEM. GOD GAVE US A REMEDY. TO THOSE OF
[1:17:30] US WHO SIT HERE TODAY WHO HAVE THE
[1:17:32] PRIVILEGE OF STILL BEING MARRIED TO OUR
[1:17:33] WIVES, WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO ACCEPT A
[1:17:36] REMEDY THAT SAYS, "NO MATTER WHAT,
[1:17:39] NO MATTER WHAT,
[1:17:41] DEATH WILL ONLY CHANGE OUR DWELLING. NO
[1:17:44] MATTER WHAT, I'M WITH YOU TO THE END. NO
[1:17:46] MATTER WHAT, I'LL STICK THIS OUT.
[1:17:51] God gives us a remedy.
[1:17:53] And I believe that there's so much
[1:17:55] pointing. There's so much
[1:17:56] misunderstanding this sermon. And I'm I
[1:17:59] have not I trust by God's grace that you
[1:18:01] could you could say amen to this. I have
[1:18:03] not changed anything that brother
[1:18:06] Brandham taught. I have not anolded. I
[1:18:08] have not disqualified it. I haven't
[1:18:09] taken anything away from it. I am merely
[1:18:11] pointing out more of what he taught.
[1:18:14] that there's another side to this that
[1:18:16] perhaps we miss sometimes. And listen to
[1:18:18] how brother Badam says it, paragraph 312
[1:18:21] at to the end in marriage and divorce.
[1:18:23] I'm just going to read this to you. I
[1:18:25] hope that this could anchor in your
[1:18:27] hearts. I hope that you could hear this.
[1:18:29] To me, it is one of the most anointed
[1:18:32] moments in Brother Bram's ministry that
[1:18:34] when you listen to it,
[1:18:38] there is such a divine inspiration.
[1:18:40] There is such a pulsating to the heart
[1:18:42] of God and to thank that as brother
[1:18:44] Brandham says there he was in Tucson
[1:18:47] below finger rock in that pill column of
[1:18:49] fire coming up and down witnessed by
[1:18:52] people and there God is giving him this
[1:18:56] and he's seeing something and he's not
[1:18:58] just being taken and the God is not the
[1:19:00] ANGEL LORD IS JUST NOT SAYING well over
[1:19:02] here it says this and over here it says
[1:19:04] that I believe that God did is he gave
[1:19:05] him he opened up a realm where he
[1:19:09] entered into to the original marriage
[1:19:11] covenant and he enters into that divine
[1:19:13] favor. He enters into that love and he
[1:19:15] recognizes something that's ETERNAL AND
[1:19:17] WITHOUT END. AND when he senses THAT AND
[1:19:19] FEELS THAT I KNOW I'M JUST DRAMATIZING
[1:19:21] WHEN HE SEES THAT, IT BRINGS SUCH A
[1:19:24] STARK CONTRAST TO THE DIVORCE that
[1:19:26] exists TODAY AND ALL THE SUBSEQUENT
[1:19:28] ISSUES THAT COME DOWN TO IT. AND SO WHEN
[1:19:30] GOD GAVE THIS SERMON TO BROTHER
[1:19:32] BRANDHAM, IT WAS NOT TO ATTACK THE TWO
[1:19:34] SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT. HE'S SAYING THEY
[1:19:36] BOTH HAVE SOME TRUTH, BUT THEY'RE BOTH
[1:19:38] WRONG. HE SAYS, "WE DON'T WANT TO GO
[1:19:39] SOUTHEAST. WE DON'T WANT TO GO
[1:19:40] NORTHEAST. WE WANT TO GO DO EAST." HE
[1:19:43] WAS WANTING US TO GET THE TRUTH OF IT.
[1:19:45] AND I IF I COULD SAY THIS, NOT JUST TO
[1:19:48] KNOW WHY THINGS ARE MESSED UP, BUT KNOW
[1:19:50] [screaming] HOW WE CAN'T OR WHY HOW
[1:19:53] WE'LL NEVER MESS UP.
[1:19:55] HE WANT US TO KNOW HOW TO STAY OUT OF A
[1:19:57] MESS.
[1:19:59] He says it wasn't so from the beginning,
[1:20:02] but Moses permitted it and God
[1:20:04] recognized its righteousness.
[1:20:07] Paul also had a right when he found this
[1:20:08] church in that condition.
[1:20:11] Now you believe this to be true and
[1:20:14] believe it to come from God.
[1:20:17] And by THE VINDICATION OF HIS CLOUD AND
[1:20:19] HIS MESSAGE THAT'S BROUGHT ME THIS FAR,
[1:20:22] should God upon that mountain permit me
[1:20:24] to do the same thing?
[1:20:27] To suffer you to go on the way you are
[1:20:29] and do it no more?
[1:20:32] Go with your wives and live in peace for
[1:20:34] the hour late.
[1:20:37] THE COMING OF THE LORD IS at hand. We
[1:20:40] haven't got time to break these things
[1:20:42] up.
[1:20:44] And listen to what he says. Don't you
[1:20:46] dare try to do it again.
[1:20:49] I'm speaking only to my congregation.
[1:20:51] But if you're married, God bore me
[1:20:53] witness of that on the mountain that I
[1:20:54] could say this a supernatural revelation
[1:20:56] because of the opening of the seals.
[1:20:58] This is a question in God's word. Let
[1:21:00] them go in as they are in sin no more.
[1:21:04] It wasn't so from the beginning. What
[1:21:06] was it in the beginning? What did Adam
[1:21:08] do in the beginning? What does that tell
[1:21:10] us as his bride in the beginning? What
[1:21:12] does that tell us as spouses in the
[1:21:14] beginning?
[1:21:16] In the beginning, it wasn't he can, she
[1:21:18] can't.
[1:21:19] In the beginning, it wasn't just
[1:21:21] separation. In the beginning, it was
[1:21:23] redemption. So, he says that's right. It
[1:21:26] wasn't so. And it'll not be at THE END.
[1:21:29] AMEN.
[1:21:30] BUT UNDER MODERN CONDITIONS AS GOD'S
[1:21:32] SERVANT, I WON'T CALL MYSELF HIS
[1:21:33] PROPHET, but I believe maybe if I
[1:21:35] wouldn't be sent for that, I'm laying a
[1:21:36] ground for him that when he does come.
[1:21:38] And he says some things very particular
[1:21:39] to that at the beginning. SO UNDER THE
[1:21:41] MODERN CONDITIONS, I COMMAND YOU TO GO
[1:21:43] TO YOUR HOME with your wife now. If you
[1:21:45] are happy with her, live with her. Raise
[1:21:47] your children in the admonition of God.
[1:21:49] But God be merciful to you if you ever
[1:21:51] do that again.
[1:21:53] And he says, "You teach your children to
[1:21:56] never do such a THING LIKE THAT. BRING
[1:21:59] THEM UP IN THE ADMONITION OF GOD. I
[1:22:02] BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO TEACH A
[1:22:03] DIFFERENT STANDARD TO OUR CHILDREN THAT
[1:22:06] WE WANT TO RAISE OUR YOUNG MEN TO LOVE
[1:22:08] THEIR WIVES AS CHRIST LOVES THE CHURCH.
[1:22:10] NOT IN THE IMAGE OF THE UNFAITHFUL MEN
[1:22:12] THAT HAVE PERVERTED THE MESSAGE AND MADE
[1:22:14] IT A A CODEL, MADE IT A STICK TO BEAT UP
[1:22:17] THE CHURCH, MADE IT A STICK TO BEAT UP
[1:22:19] THE WOMAN, BUT HAVE PERFECT LOVE.
[1:22:22] Teach your children to never do such a
[1:22:24] THING LIKE THAT. BRING THEM up in the
[1:22:25] admonition of God. And now that you are
[1:22:27] as you are, let us go now at the late
[1:22:30] evening hour that we're living in
[1:22:31] impressed toward the mark of the high
[1:22:33] calling IN CHRIST WHERE ALL THINGS ARE
[1:22:35] POSSIBLE.
[1:22:37] DON'T YOU [screaming] BELIEVE ALL THINGS
[1:22:38] ARE POSSIBLE? I THANK GOD FOR THE GRACE
[1:22:41] THAT'S EXTENDED IN THIS TO GIVE A GRACE
[1:22:43] AND TO DECLARE RIGHTEOUSNESS ON
[1:22:45] SITUATIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE PERMITTED
[1:22:47] BY GOD THAT MAY NOT THAT STILL LINE UP
[1:22:50] UNDER THE DOUBLE COVENANT. BUT I THANK
[1:22:52] GOD THAT GRACE TEACHES US THE ORIGINAL
[1:22:55] COVENANT. AMEN.
[1:22:58] And that we can be inspired to a higher
[1:23:00] love and a greater love.
[1:23:03] Then to instinctively reach
[1:23:06] for a double covenant.
[1:23:09] And as God is restoring the hearts of
[1:23:11] his children to his heart,
[1:23:16] the reason for the double covenant is
[1:23:19] changing is is is is going away.
[1:23:23] set in a new nature.
[1:23:25] But now that the oneness has come again,
[1:23:28] comes back to a single covenant.
[1:23:32] I know at the very least I've given you
[1:23:33] a lot to think about.
[1:23:35] Could we stand together today?
