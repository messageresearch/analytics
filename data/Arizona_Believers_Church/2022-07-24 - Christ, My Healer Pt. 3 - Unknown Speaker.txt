TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what psalms 107 verses 17 to 20 it says fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul abhoreth all manner of meat and they draw near into the gates of death then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses what a remarkable passage he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing amen god bless you you can take your seats i have a a tremendous amount of scriptures in front of me and i realized that at some point we might want to just stop and uh pick up later on and so trust you'll kind of just stay real close to what we're ministering on and try to get out of it as much as you possibly can we're on the subject of christ my healer that's the title the subject is divine healing and it has a lot to do with placing our faith correctly in scripture and if our faith is placed right then it can grow and we've even labored on showing that we have faith it's a gift of god and sometimes it's not a matter of not having faith it's just not having it placed exactly right so we're wanting our faith to be placed right so that can grow and in the subject i really are hoping that christ becomes more personal to us so that we understand christ a little bit more and i could say this that we are endeavoring to strengthen our faith by even looking at a specific promise as we say christ my healer we're looking at the promise of divine healing we're learning about a very specific promise in scripture or an attribute of god and in doing that it will strengthen our faith even by zeroing in on just one thing it can strengthen our faith because we know that our perfection will come by faith and that faith comes by hearing the word and it grows by hearing the word we read this statement last time i believe last time we ministered on this subject we've been preaching on this on a series on wednesday nights and so if some of you are like we're we've been when have we started this subject we started on a wednesday night a few wednesday nights ago and i'm going to go i want to move it to sundays now for some time as the lord would lead and so hopefully we'll all kind of be caught up together in this it's the statement and what it takes to overcome all unbelief he says now the initial and original way to receive any redemptive blessing is by hearing the word of god because faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god he says like the ministers preached so we can say this redemption is in the word and so there is a promise of redemption or there are redemptive blessings that god has given his children and i know this is just stating the obvious but the original way of receiving any redemptive blessing is to hear about it it may seem extremely logical but if you don't know anything about redemption if you don't know about the blessings of christ then once you hear about it that's your opportunity to just receive it by faith because you hear it's a promise to you your faith reaches out and grabs it and then you can receive it so to receive a redemptive blessing you have to first heard about it and paul talks about how can they believe except they hear and he goes through that process in romans 10 of how hearing the word of god causes one to believe and then they call upon the name of the lord so that's god's original way of redemption is his word being preached and so in this today i guess i'll say this today in this part three on this series uh we're going to be identifying healing as an attribute of god and how he has given us a promise to heal in his word and it's going to be very very fundamental but i hope that the picture becomes more vivid for you if you look at verse 17 of psalms 107 we're just now looking back at our text it says fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul of worth all manner of meat and they draw near to the unto the gates of death then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses the psalmist here is first identifying a spiritual sickness the depravity of mankind putting it even in the context of a fool because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted and he's outlining that it is because of sin that there is sickness if there was no sin there would be no sickness so it's because of sin that their sickness and so that is if i could emphasize this and i'm using these scriptures because it just brings us right to the gate of it he says fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted because of sin their sickness and that is why in the atonement for our sins there's healing when he had paid the price for our redemption it included healing in isaiah chapter 53 verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities so he said fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities but now in prophecy of christ he's wounded for our transgressions he's bruised for our iniquities the very cause for affliction and it says and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed so in the the taking care of our transgressions in the taking care of our iniquities there is peace for us and there is healing for us by his stripes we are healed as we read in psalms 103 a few weeks ago bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases so they find that they they begin to become companions one with another that if sin is atoned for sin is the cause of sickness that there's also a promise for healing in the word of god by virtue of his shed blood which covers your soul atones for your sins but then there's divine healing that comes with it and brother branham in the sermon the godhead explained this is a very striking statement i believe that divine healing is based upon a principle that you ought to come to god first and give your heart to him now i know it's not necessary that someone be a christian or that someone be filled with the holy ghost to receive healing but ultimately what was the price of redemption for not just merely to heal a sick body but to save our souls so it being and i think it's i want to be careful the way that i say it because i'm almost saying it's kind of a a consequence or a byproduct but he gave his life to redeem our souls and that such a tremendous shedding of blood that it includes the healing of our body and by faith people can receive healing but all the ultimate would be the saving of the soul the healing of the soul so he says he believes that divine healing is based upon a principle that you ought to come to god first and give your heart to him because the shedding of blood was to purchase that heart he says and wash up your lives in the blood of jesus christ and then god will go to work with you and heal you i'd say that would be that would be the ultimate if someone's sick and you know that they don't know the lord you'd want to minister to them in such a way to where they come to know the lord and they and their hearts may move to receive christ not just merely so that they can be healed but so that their sins can be forgiven in jeremiah chapter 17 verse 14 heal me o lord and i shall be healed if he heals you you are healed he says save me and i shall be saved for thou art my praise so the healing and salvation you find are are closely connected together but we know your body can be healed and then get sick again we may all be able to testify to that that we god heals us of one thing and only to have another issue or even sometimes the very same thing that we are healed of later on it can come right back again but when your soul is delivered it is delivered forever god can't save you to lose you the price that he paid for your soul and the healing of the soul it is permanent but yet god can heal your body for your body only to get sick again so the fools because of their transgressions and their iniquities are sick the psalmist is bringing sickness into view in our sins and our iniquities and then he says that they cried unto the lord and he saved them out of their distresses verse 20 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions he sent his word and his word healed him he sent his word and his word delivered them from their destructions it's the word that accomplished it he says oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful work to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing the psalmist in in using this phrase he sent his word and healed them and his word delivered them he's looking back upon what god had done for israel and how that god demonstrated his power to heal and how it came to pass even by the word in exodus chapter 23 verse 25 and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and god speaking and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee notice this promise and if it and i said in the beginning this is going to be very fundamental and you're saying well i believe in healing i believe in healing i believe in him well then we're just supporting it i don't feel that i came today trying to bring something new or convince a skeptic i know that there's some and dispensationalists that believe that miracles were taken out of the church and that there is no more divine healing but at least we're looking in the scripture to identify that god at one time they would have to admit healed sicknesses he says i will take sickness away from the midst of thee and this is this is a declaration that he makes in the exodus and in exodus in the beginning of exodus exodus chapter uh three and four the lord says i am come down in exodus chapter three he meets with moses at the burning bush he says i am come down to deliver thee this is the very genesis of the exodus and he's going to take the children of israel out of egypt and out of bondage and at the very outset of commissioning moses he performs a miracle to declare this attribute of healing in exodus chapter 4 verses 6 and 7 and the lord said furthermore unto him this is after his staff turned into a serpent and back again he says put now thy hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow so he puts his hand in his bosom inside his cloak as it were and he brings out and he's got leprosy on his hand and and this would be shocking and he says and he and he says in verse 7 put that hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and he plucked it out of his bosom behold it was turned again as his other flesh in deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 29 it says see that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand that's exactly what he did with moses his hand was perfectly fine no leprosy puts it in his bosom to withdraw it again and it has leprosy but then he asked him to put it back in again and the very one that put the leprosy on him is the very one that heals and it may seem to be a paradox but he says i kill and i and i will make alive i wound and i heal so when moses puts his hand in his cloak and he removes it and it's leprous and then he puts it in again and he takes it out brother branham says it showed him divine healing and as moses is being commissioned and moses is wondering how is it that i am going to go down and deliver the children out of egypt your children out of egypt how can i declare your power how can i declare your greatness and god gives them these signs the staff being turned into a serpent and then this sign of his hand turning leprous you don't see it demonstrated before pharaoh or before genesis jamboree's or anyone's but brother man said divine healing is included in the glory of god he says another place divine healing is god's glory so god's glory is going to be made known in egypt and so he's showing uh moses this attribute of this characteristic so he can have this confidence in god to go down and deliver the children at his command in exodus chapter 15 verse 26 this may be one of the most outstanding scriptures on the a god being a healer and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i brought upon the egyptians so he's the one that wounds and he says i will keep you from being sick and so that's a testimony uh we ought to thank god for healing or we ought to thank god for good health uh just as much as we would pray when we're sick maybe we should praise when we're well when we get really desperate when we're sick and the covet test comes back positive and we want god to stop it and we want god to heal us and we call out to him and saying god deliver us if we are well and we're not sick we should probably have an equal amount of praise and thanksgiving for keeping us well because it's the lord that keeps us from diseases and he says for i am the lord that healeth thee that's jehovah rapha the lord that heals i am the lord that healeth him i i think maybe it's kind of in the undercurrent i won't emphasize it maybe over and over again but god's the only one who can heal there's no other healer there's no divine healer outside of god it's jehovah rapha the lord that heals bill abram said he can't be jehovah rapha without being jehovah jireh neither can he be jehovah jabra without being jehovah rapha all these attributes these seven redemptive names of jehovah they're all kind of working together in each one declaring the same god not chopped up individuals say oh i'm praying today to jehovah jibril the one who sees and conv providing oh well that's great because i'm praying to jehovah rapha because i need physical healing no it's the same one it's the same jehovah it's the same jesus christ and if he's jehovah jireh he's also jehovah rapha he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we are healed and so this is the psalmist he sent his word and healed them it's in a way it's looking backwards but it's also prophetic uh going forward because god is revealing himself in exodus and the exodus and to the children of israel through moses he's revealing himself to the seed of abraham as a healer and healing was in their atonement job writes about it it's written of job much earlier in job 5 18. he says he maketh sore which is the lord that wounds and heals he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole this is a characteristic of god in psalms 30 verse 2 oh lord my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me delivered me saved me this is a characteristic of god we find in genesis chapter 20 verse 17 so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bear children here's the prayer of abraham the father of faith praying for one praying for his family and god heals them and his maidservants his wife and they bear children god healed abimelech in second kings chapter 20 verse 5 it says turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears and behold i will heal thee and the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord these are all these are just a few examples of divine healing in the old testament how abraham prays and god heals abimelech here hezekiah cries out to the lord oh leaked in my days don't cut my day short and he says i've heard thee and i will heal thee this is prayer being offered up and god healing the individual who is sick these are all examples of divine healing being a uh or just if i say this why healing being a divine attribute or a characteristic of god it's a mark of god divine healing is a mark of god in numbers chapter 21 verse start with verse 6 and then we'll skip and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died they said again this kind of fits with the i wound and i healed they were complaining and murmuring and what did god do he sent he sent serpents and i know it's a it's it's it's difficult these attributes and characteristics of god people wrestle with these there's people that read the old testament i think man god's crazy it's like the meme that shows jesus knocking on the door and it says open up and jesus says i want to save you and the person says from what and the meme says for what i'm going to do to you if you don't open the door right and that's that's how people look at it they're like i'm so confused here you want me to save me save me for what will save me for what i'm going to do to you if you don't let me save you and the world just tries to understand god through human means and human things but if you could just consider this that there was a god completely invisible that wants to have equal fellowship with someone who does not exist therefore they could not be god right and so there's he he in his wisdom divine has a plan of redemption to bring forth a people that'll love him who is invisible and he can have fellowship with so he wants to manifest himself and declare himself and make himself known to his people and these are the ways that god makes himself known and so he they serve the snakes come out bite the people and they die in verse 8 the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it should come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived and this this is a remarkable occurrence in scripture the deadly serpents are killing people and with the bite they die but now something is lifted up before the people and then this ensign that has lifted up this symbol of a serpent on a pole that when they looked upon it god upon their their eyes meeting that and seeing that they find themselves healed of whatever this venom was that would have killed them the sermon god identified himself by his characteristics he says notice he had a brass serpent that had been lifted up for the sickness and diseases of the people therefore moses was practicing divine healing he had the atonement the brass serpent symbolizing that god was in the camp and the people were looking on that brass serpent and being healed it was uh it was moses was practicing divine healing obeying the word of god lifting up this serpent upon a pole this image of it and they they say that it must have been quite large for it to be in a place where people could view it and see it and be and be healed and it says lift it up before the people and it's divine healing taking place right within the camp taking place right within the children of israel they're looking upon this and they're being healed and there's though there's some debate as to the origin of it there's a lot of evidence to suggest that even subsequent uses of it in mythology it was drawing from this very image in the exodus but we even see it being used in the armed services of a two serpents on a on a pole and and even within the hippocratic oath and within medicine what what is it used to declare i think the world health organization has a pole with a snake wrapped around it and it it calls back to this very image of divine healing medicine is testifies of divine healing a great example we know that life is the healer right you take a dead body or you take you take someone who's dead and you cut the flesh and you put balm on it and you suture it and you put all the ointments all the medicine you do everything you can to the wound in order for it to mend back again it'll never heal itself because life has left the body and that's why life is the healer it's not there's not some medicine there's not some treatment there's not some cure in itself that heals but god has made the body with healing in itself to where god can quicken that attribute and heal the body life is the healer not not just medicine or doctors and i realized that now maybe some statements i wanted to use will just be pushing off for another time but then it this serpent that's lifted up in the wilderness jesus said and as moses john 3 14 and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up what did it foreshadow foreshadowed christ it spoke of christ it declared an attribute of god as a healer but also is declaring this attribute of christ the one who is by his stripes we are healed and so if you are i hope i could come to this about anecdotal faith but if you're if you're just looking at this example people get bit by a snake you take a serpent put on a pole and when they look at the they look at the snake and they're healed now someone could just look at the optics of that just what is seen and then worship the snake or go find a snake and put them on a pole or worship the element of brass and and put all sorts of confidence in the certain elements that existed at the time that they were healed and not realized that god told the prophet to do something and so the healing is connected with god's commandment in not just the brass not the serpent or the pole or the size of it or your ability to see it necessarily but a promise of god and so there's a danger even in this supernatural happening there was a danger that this uh where the people lost focus from god's promise and put it more on the elements and the mechanics of it so ii kings chapter 18 verses 3 and 4 when hezekiah became king it says and he did that which was right on the side of the lord and according to all that david his father did and he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the groves and broke break in pieces the brazen serpent that moses had made for under those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it nehushtan which means a thing of brass that's chopping it down right people worshipped it as the brazen serpent and had they burned incense to it it became idolatry to the children of israel and they cut it down and they destroy it and broke it into peace and says it's just a thing of brass because that's really that's all it was it was a thing of brass but it was the promise of god behind it that made it something that they could look upon and heal and so here's the danger that they had taken this very artifact of divine healing and begin to worship the artifact in contradiction to god's saying let there not be any other idols before you to have no graven images and here was something that vindicated his presence in the camp here's something that saved them from death and yet you can take those very things and make them into something that they shouldn't be and that's where there's danger even in these things in the sermon principles of divine healing it says god always had a provided way for the people to be healed he gave it in the days of israel's journey he had the brass serpent after the going away of the brass serpent when people make an idol out of it the prophet broke up the serpent and tore it up and threw it away they made an idol out of the very thing that provided healing and then he gets into the pool of bethesda now that once that pool had been built and that the angel lord would trouble it and that became another place of divine healing for israel but he says god always provided a way for the people to be healed but they made the provided way this are this this element this artifact an idol he says in the sermon being led to the spirit many times the people stray away and they make an idol out of the very thing that god has ordained this is i'm wanting you to focus on this because there's a danger here god manifest himself in this element of divine healing through this brazen serpent but then it actually becomes something that they worship in contradiction to god's word he says many times people stray away and make an idol out of the very thing that god has ordained look at the serpent the brass serpent in the wilderness did you know the prophet had to tear that serpent to pieces it was a king actually why because the people were worshiping the serpent and they made an idol out of it do you believe you can do that today you can make an idol out of your church you can make an idol out of your pastor i'm hoping i'm making that really hard for you you can make an idol out of your pastor you can make an idol out of an evangelist and i'm afraid that that's what a lot of of it's being done they idolized the man now he if we even just look at our sincerity the children of israel didn't just go out and find a pole laying on the ground and someone had carved up a nice snake you know buck whaling put carves a snake out of a piece of wood and you go and you find it and you put it on the you put it on a stick and you start worshiping it no this is something that the god had told moses to do it's associated with the prophet it's associated with his vindication and his presence with israel and the exodus and so in there's just a slight slip just a slight deviation they begin to worship this and so people can make an idol out of their church just so subtly not because they're evil but because they see god move in the church and instead of it drawing them closer to god maybe just with a little bit of leaven they begin to draw closer to their church instead make an idol out of their pastor not because their pastor is worldly and they love worldliness but because god uses the pastor and instead of it being effective to draw them closer to christ they're only seeing the flesh and the man and they begin to lift up the man he says you can make an idol out of an evangelist how because my he comes and he preaches and people are healed and god moves and man he does so much more uh deliverance than the pastor ever does he does so much more delivering and is more dynamic than these other ministers and instead of you thanking god for the gift and recognizing that's the move of god and it's the same christ you make an idol out of the man so with that consider this statement in the message conferences i'm against a lot of this here super-duper divine healing they have in the land today you might not like me after this remark but i'm going to say it anyhow they got so much super duper stuff oh divine healing everything buddy only thing you do is hallelujah is have hands laid on you owe glory to god this is a incredible statement he realized that even in saying it might cause some not to like him because he's identifying some imbalance in an emphasis that isn't centered completely on the word of god where now it's like oh divine healing that's it that's where it's at oh just lay hands on glory to god hallelujah he said that's not so repent and get right with god that's what we need more repentance it's it's identifying how that you can begin to major on something that's complementary and you begin to get the order reversed and the emphasis becomes more on the super duper divine healing more on the divine healing instead of the divine healer emphasis on the brass serpent instead of the one who gave his command to heal them he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions brother braham said divine healing is based on his word that's what i'm wanting to drive home today is divine healing is based on the word this is very clear in the old testament it was his word it's god's word it's god's promise he sent his word and healed them and his word delivered them the bible teaches us he is the same yesterday today and forever divine healing is based on his word now i'm just taking a piece out because i wanted to then originally i was going to transition from old testament to new testament and begin to show how christ uh the all the miracles they performed and all this ministry of divine healing and how jehovah of the old is jesus of the new and these redemptive names are now in christ jesus and so many different examples we can begin to show of god healing but just to capitalize on he sent his word it says in luke chapter 5 verse 17 and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching didasko that means to teach or to hold a discourse with others in order to destruct instruct them not destruct them you want to destruct their unbelief and so there is a you're either going to attract the believer or drive and drive unbelief away but he's he's teaching he's instructing them it's to teach one that's what that's where we get the word doctrine from this didasco he's teaching and there were pharisees and doctors of law sitting by oh i got a jd and he says doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of galilee and judea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was present to heal them it wasn't some super-duper healer it wasn't the amount of sweat it wasn't that the the smoke machine was working just well just right that morning but he's just teaching he's holding discourse with others to instruct them and through teaching the word of god it says the power of the lord was present to heal them because the power of god to heal is in his word brother brahman in the sermon serves we would see jesus he says divine healing is not done by a man did not jesus even himself said i could do nothing except my father show me i say what he tells me to say i do what i see him do divine healing is not done by a man divine healing is the finished product only thing that a minister can do is preach the word that ought to be sufficient that ought to settle it that ought to be sufficient that you who are sick to say look the promise is by his stripes we are healed that that would seem to be sufficient because all a minister can do a minister can't heal you i i i can preach on blue in the face today and get really lathered up and real sweaty and i could speak with tongues and the music could be just right and just almost like mesmer just mesmerizing us with the music and everything and i can kind of shake my hands and crack my knuckles and say come up here i'm going to bless you i couldn't heal one of you the only thing i could do is preach the word and he says that that ought to be sufficient brother bram said the devil fights this wonderful truth of divine healing and marks it up so maybe it would be enough if we didn't have a devil like if he'd just given up you know when christ died and was rose again he goes i blew it you know i've been waiting for this to happen ever since god said the seat of the woman would bruise my head and i blew it and i walked right into the trap and i'm defeated and there's nothing i can do and if you just kind of left it alone and we just kind of had this liberty just to take god at his word but the devil has gummed it up he's marked it up look dropping back to the fundamentals here well let me just i think maybe this is where i might want to skip a little bit let's just let's look at let's go to mark chapter 16. i know i'm skipping several slides but i i'm leaving off quite a bit here i'm not even sure why i'm doing this i just feel impressed uh to to skip a few things here because we have this the thought is that it's a promise made in the word of god and preaching the word of god ought to be sufficient so in mark chapter 16 verses 14 to 20 we would maybe read this as the great commission afterward he appeared into the eleven as they sat at meat and upgraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had been seen which had seen him after he was risen again you could just look at that dynamic that he has risen and he's seen of some and the some testify and they don't believe and upon what basis did he want them to believe that they said so right and it wasn't just something they made up not only was it something they had seen but it was something that he had told them before that he would do that he would raise again after three days he'd given him that promise so here's some testifying you remember how he said that he would raise he has risen indeed and without them seeing it think well i mean i guess i kind of would have want to see him myself but he says he uprated them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they didn't believe those that had testified of his resurrection according to his promise and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and the gospel is is the very thing that they didn't believe right the christ crucified for our sins rose on the third day and is this and this this is the gospel the gospel of christ he says now you're going to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature the power of the gospel is the gospel the word of god has power in it as he was teaching there was power present to heal them all this is there was there was a power there just in the word of god just in preaching the gospel there's power he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth what the gospel go preach the gospel he that believes the gospel and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned notice it says nothing of baptism because he that believeth truly believeth will be baptized and will be saved and then he that believeth not doesn't matter how wet he gets he can't be saved and it says and these signs shall follow them that believe remember we made this statement where or we mentioned the statement only a minister all he can do is preach and that ought to be sufficient thought to settle it but the devil fights this wonderful truth and divine healing she says and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink in the deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so they that believed were going to go into all the world and preach the gospel and preach in the gospel it was to cause others to hear the word of god and believe upon him and be saved and then there's signs also that follow the believer casting out devils speaking with new tongues taking up serpents drinking neatly deadly thing and it not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up in heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following so the goal of any preaching is to instigate faith in jesus christ that's the reason why we preach he that believeth he preached the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved so there has to be a hearing of the word of god to instigate faith in jesus christ to receive him and then in believing be baptized in the name of jesus christ and and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost therein lies the salvation the sealing of the soul and it has to happen uh by the word being preached now as humans especially with as much pride as we take in our words and our thoughts we would say well if if you don't believe me that's fine and in some ways we recognize that jesus upgrading them for their unbelief he says he's risen and he appears unto some of the disciples they run back and say he's risen he's risen he's risen like i don't trust you and if it was us we'd like fine don't believe me right wait a minute am i the only one that might do that i think a lot of us probably think that way that well if you don't trust me fine you know if you don't believe me fine because we take we just think well i see it i believe it i'm trustworthy i you ought to trust me you don't have any reason not to believe me and we would think that our word would be enough just take me at my word that should be enough if you don't believe me fine but god in his grace and his understanding of human nature takes it a step further and even though he might upgrade us for unbelief to not take him at his word he goes a step further and he says i will go ahead and confirm my presence with signs following we read this statement in the very beginning now the initial and original way to receive any redemptive blessing is by hearing the word of god because faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god like ministers preach if that were you and i that would be sufficient if the people didn't want to believe us why we would just let them go on but god is so good and so full of mercy to after all that he sent his word then he sent gifts into the church there's sufficient enough evidence in the bible to say that god's a healer we could just have the example of hezekiah the example of abraham the examples in the in the lifting up of the brass serpent we could just look back and say well god hears the cries of his people god will answer prayer with abimelech abraham prayed and god healed him with hezekiah he prayed and god healed him and and we can say well that should be enough but god takes it a step further and he gives signs and gifts into the church the sermon jehovah jireh i've got perfect confidence in you as my brethren i know you're men of god called of god this is at the end of service and what he's doing is actually calling a prayer line he's having them line up on each side he's going to perform two lines for or for people to pass through and and maybe just the typical prayer line that you might be used to and he's having different ministers of god come and stand up and they're going to be the ones that are going to extend their hands they're going to be the ones that are laying hands on the sick they're going to be the ones that are praying and he says i have confidence in you men i'm trying to let this audience know that they don't have to wait for somebody to come by some special gift gifts don't heal gifts only declare god why because there's no such thing as some super-duper divine healer that even when god can genuinely move behind a man of god move behind an evangelist move in a particular ministry demonstrate many wonderful things people can get their eye on the man that god is using they can get their eye on the one who has the gift for your benefit and they look at that and he says i want to break us out of this mindset that you've got to wait on this cycle of annual meetings annual camps or a particular minister to come by or an evangelist or go visit some particular place so that you can receive your heal and he says gifts don't heal gifts only declare god you're ministers you know the word a lot better than i do so your gift is to do that that's the original way believe his word he sent his word and healed them that's the way it's supposed to be but then god's so good and makes such promises if they can't believe the word then he shows them a sign that it's him there that's what it's for that's the reason i have you here just preaching the word ought to accomplish it that would be the original way just by preaching the word of god he's a healer he's a healer and you sitting there would say oh i believe i believe god i heal and receive your healing even as the word is going forth that would be the the the best way uh to be healed in one place brother branham says that uh mr argenbright said to me that's number seven in the prayer cards was already healed while i was preaching he says praise the lord that's good that's the original way that's his way of doing it preaching the word and that's the way to do it preaching the word and to get healed by preaching god sent his word and what did it do it healed them that's right that's good so the ultimate is not even healing the ultimate is the word he says may this audience now without any sign at all may they just receive the word you sent your word and healed them may the word of god find a place in every heart may they be healed everyone both spiritually and physically we ask in jesus name by what the word he speaks of divine healing being a finished work at calvary and a minister that's taught in the word he can stand up and preach the word to you now if he preaches the word faith comes by hearing hearing the word of god that's the original so we can say that's the original way priest's word preached the word but then he says if they can't believe the word what mercy what grace do you realize just how legalistic we could get sometimes well man this word is perfect it's so clear god's a healer if you don't want to hear it i told you he's a healer then forget about it and walk away but god is so good that if they can't believe he shows them a sign that he's there that's what it's for we have to place these things right because we'll we'll even take certain things well that's just nothing but some sort of tradition and that's this and that's that and you don't even realize what it's there for they can't believe the word then he shows them a sign all right i hope i'm doing all right here with time first corinthians chapter 12 verses 28 to 30. you let me know when i'm done it could be a risky proposition brother obed's gonna say all right brother aaron you're done [Laughter] first corinthians chapter 12 verses 28 to 30. and god had set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues are all apostles or all prophets or all teachers or all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret these are rhetorical questions what's the answer no they don't all do it but some do notice he has put gifts of healings in the church they're put there you could say well just take him at his word by his stripes we're healed just take him out of his word buy his stripes here but then god rich in mercy puts gifts in the church to bring up our faith in christ to build our faith if it's hard to believe if we've been a battle scarred and wounded we've suffered disappointments we've prayed and we didn't get what we asked for and it causes us just to be a little bit reluctant then god has a way of trying to woo us to believe and take him at his word and one of the ways he does is by declaring his presence amongst his people and if we just don't take him at his word he wants to show you that he's there for you he wants to start with you give you some basis to take him at his word some point of contact to see he made the promise and he healed us that's exactly what the brass serpent was they're grumbling they're complaining because of their complaining death enters into the camp but then god raises up a sign and inside that's lifted up so the people looking upon her healed and it would cause them to recognize lord forgive us for our grumbling forgive us for railing against you forgive us for our complaining forgive us for wanting to go back that's what brought upon us these serpents but you provided a way of escape and we looked at it and that they would glorify god not worship the serpent gifts of healings he says do all have gifts of healing we know they don't brother branham in the sermon looking unto jesus this very unique statement he says you know what the gift of healing is faith in healing see you just release your faith to pray for somebody that's all the gift of healing is again it's not some kind of right come over here i'm gonna touch your knee all right or just put this rabbit rabbit tail under your arm and and a pinch of toad liver under your tongue and then i'm gonna you know slap you on your forehead and all of a sudden you're gonna get well that's not a that's not a gift of healing a gift of healing is just to believe that's what a gift of healing is and certain people have it there's there's ones i've heard this even testified by other men of god that brother ernest fulcher in virginia has just a a gift of praying that that there's those that testify if they were ever sick they're calling him up and asking him to pray because he believes that god's a healer absolutely convinced of it and it's all based on faith and so a gift of healing is to believe that when i pray for you you're going to get well he says every minister should have it every minister should have a gift of healing why he should be absolutely convinced that god's a healer and he says everybody see should have gift of healing so paul asking do all have gifts of healing we realize we all don't but maybe we all should if he could save your soul certainly could heal your body he said he says the power that heals you is on the inside of you the holy spirit you just have to let it work its way out that's all it's not the man who's the healer there's no man with divine healing but a man can have such confidence in the word of god that when he prays for you it you you have confidence that god's going to hear his prayer and that that prayer is going to deliver you and release you and make you well but what happens when someone has a gift of healing they turn that one who has the gift of healing into the healer and they make an idol out of them and they put more emphasis on the man's words or the man's faith instead of the word of god that built his own faith brother branham when he's taking questions and answers on the seals he says just look what the little gift of divine healing is a gift of healing has done come on his own ministry he says how it confused the church everybody had a sensation everybody had this this is when ministries began to rise up and different tremendous healing ministries begin to sweep the nation everybody else wanted to have something sensational or super-duper and instead of the attention being on the word of god or the attention being on christ it gets more drawn to the ministries and that's what a gift of healing can do when you get your eyes on the one that has the gift instead of the one who gave the gift and the focus just strays from the word it strays from the promise to the natural part and that's where i'm using the phrase it becomes anecdotal faith because you look at the particular instance in which god heals somebody and go oh so you came in a prayer line and brother so and so prayed for you and all the ministers were praying for you and waymaker was being played and it was on a saturday night and they're like oh i can't wait for that next time that that brother is having a prayer line in a particular meeting and they could be plain waymaker and i can be prayed for and they don't see the promise that god made to heal and what a gift of healing is they look at all the other anecdotal evidence related to it and their faith becomes anecdotal because it's so fixated on the particular instance that's how we build idols that's how we turn think promises of god into traditions and jesus says you've made god the word of god a nun effect through your tradition because you made the thing itself the thing when the thing was supposed to testify of christ it should just be a brass thing but you make it an idol we put the emphasis on the specific outward manifestation instead of the actual word something supernatural can take place oh so that's how it happened that's what took place and then what we want is we want to see the same manifestation for some sort of vindication or some sort of evidence i know it's a much larger thought but i just keep mentioning it we have to be careful that our faith isn't anecdotal based specifically on the way god moved in someone's life instead of the promise that they were relying upon to see god move james chapter 5 verses 14 to he says there's any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord this is in the bible laying hands on this and anointing the sick with oil if someone is sick call the elders let them pray for him anoint him with oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much this is a promise given in the word of god paul says there's gifts of healing in the church james says that you should call for the elders when one is sick anoint the sick with oil and pray and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise them up a clear prescription in the word of god that when one is sick you can ask for prayer you can be anointed with oil the prayer of faith can be prayed and it's that prayer faith that will raise them up he says pray for one another that you may be healed and it's the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man that availeth much this wasn't just given to james it wasn't just given dispensationally to the apostles it's a promise in the word of god that we can look to today but the healing's not in the oil right the healing's not even in the hands the healing's not even the prayer the healing's in the faith in mark chapter six verse five he said he could do there no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them exactly how it's written upon a few sick folk and healed them christ in his own ministry laid his hands on the sick and they were healed then later on in that same chapter verses 12 and 13 he sends out the disciples and they went out and preached that men should repent and they cast out many devils and anointed many with oil anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them this is demonstrated in jesus ministry laying hands on the sick demonstrated in the apostles ministry in the days of christ's own ministry before he gives them the great commission later in mark chapter 16 he's preaching these things sends them out they preach the word of god they cast out devils anoint with oil and see the sick are healed jesus in luke 13 13. he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight so we could see it in the word of god but even in that it's based on the word our confidence that that would happen is based on the word otherwise we might want the apostles to come back or we need jesus physically here to here to lay his hands on us but it's something deeper than that i i got just a few more statements and then we'll close from that time brother branham says divine healing isn't based on some mental tantrum that's a that's a mindful isn't it divine healing is based on some mental tantrum i don't know what that means to you but man i'd like i could just think on that for a while what is a what is a mental tantrum get yourself worked up does it have to be some sort of enthusiasm some kind of mental uh excitement neither is it based upon some out of some oil of somebody's hands or some hocus pocus divine healing is based upon the shed blood of jesus christ the atonement he was wounded for our transgressions and with the stripes we were healed so it's upon the atonement and as long as we try to achieve a church for god we're going contrary against his will we must let the spirit come into our lives and take our lives and let him have his way in our heart that's the ultimate you wouldn't even want to see divine healing in your church just so you can build a church you wouldn't want to have people being healed just so you could gain a following you want god to vindicate his presence amongst his people that the people's hearts would be led by him and that he would take over their lives a miracle should declare god's presence and it draws something to god it doesn't vindicate a person doesn't indicate hands doesn't vindicate doterra or young living it just vindicates god's presence amongst his people and that someone in their heart would want to have him take over their life and him have a way in their heart so it's not based on a mental tantrum it's not based upon oil in someone's hands it's not a hocus pocus it's based upon the blood of jesus christ the sermon be not afraid to desire divine healing is not based upon some emotion it's not based upon some laying on of hands or some strange feeling or sensation it's based upon a faith in a work that was done for you by jesus christ at calvary it is a finished product and every person here tonight that's sick and afflicted as far as god is concerned you are already healed we believe in the power of god to heal just by based upon what's in the old testament we believe god's a healer because the word said so he says i am the lord that healeth thee and god sent his word and healed them and he could have just left it at that right but he takes it one step further that if if you are unable or if you are not taking him at his word to be healed then you can ask someone to pray for you they can anoint you with oil lay hands it's still the word of god right we believe that god will honor prayer we believe god will honor the laying on of hands we believe that god will honor the anointing with oil because the bible says so this is the promise of god this is in the word of god if someone's sick have the the elders come and pray for them and it's all meant to do what build up your faith in god because it's a promise in the word of god this isn't some hocus pocus it isn't some mental tantrum i i i couldn't tell any of you if any of you have a headache today then i want you to come up here and just bang your head on the wall seven times and you're gonna watch that headache go away you'd have no place to base that on oh so you're telling me your knee hurts well let me just stab you in the back uh you're worried about your knee now there's no there's those are just distractions there's nothing to it we don't we're not looking for a placebo effect in the house of god we can actually take god at his word he was he's gracious enough to say that i sent my word and then i'm going to vindicate my word with signs following in order to do what not become make us sign seekers but that the sign would get us to believe in him not that we would have idols and super duper healers and and work up of mental tantrums and some emotions and and get so fixated on the lane of hands but that we will believe christ is our healer so the basis for divine healing is the word our faith that god is a healer ought to be rooted in the word i'll read this i'm going to read one last statement musicians if you could come let me just read the statement from the queen of sheba because if the brass serpent can become an idol then even the man who's got a gift of healing can become an idol or the prayer line can become an idol the laying on of hands and the anointing oil can all become idols and he says now i'm what i'm trying to get the american people to see you don't have to wait for a special time for a certain evangelist to come through and pray for you your pastor is sufficient if your pastor isn't there your neighbor's sufficient if your neighbor isn't there your husband your wife is sufficient and if none of them's there just raise up your hands he's sufficient always do you see how god's willing to meet us on whatever level that's why we you you should never preach against we should never cause you to be suspicious of hands being laid on you never want to be suspicious of a prayer line you should never be suspicious of oh oil being someone being anointed with oil you say oh well the gentile way is to take him at his word well not all gentiles believe in christ i'm not wanting to just take the gentile away i want to take his way his provided way and if that's the ultimate of the bride's faith you can't just expect me to get there if all i am is a gentile the only way i could ever get to that bride level of faith is to see god confirm his promised word on every promise in the word of god and there's a lot of people that need to meet him at the altar they need to meet him in a prayer line they need to meet him with hands being laid on they need to meet him with the oil being laid on because it's all in the word of god but ultimately what you would desire for them to see is that the same god who met me at the altar the same god who met me in the prayer line it's the same god when that evangelist came through it's the same god in my pastor but if my pastor's not there it's the same god and the neighbor next to you and if the neighbor's not next to you if it's just your wife your wife can pray for you he said they are sufficient but if there's none of them there he's sufficient always just wherever you are believe it believe it it's a finished work amen let's stand
