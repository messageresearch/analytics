TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now let's jump in and go to uh second Peter chapter 3 I've got my clock here that's pretty neat i' there's a clock embedded in the Pulpit here brother minnow now that means absolutely nothing but there is a clock there all right let's let's just look at this we're we're our subject is the Harvest time now um I don't want you to worry about this but when a minister comes to your church and says I've been doing a little ser series at home that usually strikes fear in the heart of most congregations right uh because he's going to try to condense everything into one service and I'm not uh but I wanted to take a principle for you because in the Harvest time it's a really exciting thing to watch at the end of the Gentile dispensation of how many things are connected and I want to look at some of those tonight all right so there's all kinds of things that are taking place but here's what brother Braham said remember these words remember these words that everything is at the end you got to think about this now now for a moment what is a harvest but an end of something isn't it it's a completion of something and so when you come to the Harvest there's nothing beyond that there's only Gathering things in now to the burn that's what that's what the whole goal is is to have uh what what you've planted what you've swn and so Harvest represents an end and here's a prophet coming to us and signaling not only to us but to the whole world hey we're at an end time cycle we're at the end folks wake up there's nothing Beyond this for the Gentiles so therefore what's been sown is now showing itself in this Harvest cycle and the only thing left is a gathering in a gathering in to the father's barns okay so that's that's the principle and brother Braham says things like this many times in many places he says remember these words that everything's at the end civilization is at the end there's only a pretty thin veneer of civilization left in our world democracy is at the end that's interesting everything he said the nation is honeycom just any time be blown to Pieces other nations he said the world's at the end every moral thing must die that IMM immortality can take its place and he said we got to come to this place we're here we're at the end and nothing else can care now but Jesus and He does care so the name of the sermon is he careth for you and he says when you come down to that end point when you come down to that end in in season he said now you've got to make sure you know the one who's going to care for you in those dark times and you've got to be aligned with him and so that's what he's reminding us so there's many many scriptures now many many uh statements about this Harvest cycle but Jesus says in Matthew 13 let both grow together until the Harvest and and the the the workers in the parable are saying hey we notice now there's weeds in the field should we go and pull them up and the master said no no leave it all leave it all and let it grow together until the end so everything carries on in the same path until the end and in the time of the Harvest I will say to the Reapers gather you together uh first the tears and bind them in bundles and burn them but gather the weed into my barn so that tells us something we have an ingathering of the wheat and we have an out Gathering of everything else right so that's the picture that we should have about this Harvest Time that there's a there's a precious commodity that's gathered in but there's also an out Gathering there's something that is not needed and it's gathered away from this over here the separation finally comes and and and this this we know very uh commonly is what happens in the end times so when we think of harvest time and here I am with you know Saskatchewan Farmers here trying to talk to you about the Harvest so you folks can just uh get get on your phones for just a few minutes here and I'll I'll be right back brother minnow we think of harvest like this we think of uh a field of wheat but you understand right that we are the Harvest in the last day it's the souls of men that God is looking for right you understand now this is not about a bunch of loaves of bread this is about you and I right okay there's three principles I want to give you here about this Harvest Time number one if you planted a seed a harvest is inevitable the outcomes expected I mean we know what's going to come at the end of the growing cycle without any interruptions we know that if we plant wheat we're going to have wheat at the end and and that's the outcome I mean we know what we're going to get the second thing is you cannot change the outcome in the Harvest Right what you whatever you sow that's what you're going to reap so you can't pray and say oh Lord give us something different in the Harvest no it depends on what you planted right that's that's what's important here and you can't be looking for a different outcome now let me give you a little example I've had people come to me I've had one time I remember specifically I had a parent come to me a father come to to me and uh he was having problems with his 18-year-old daughter now a teenager and kind of growing up and uh she was exhibiting Tendencies of disrespect and lack of communication and wanted to do her own thing didn't want to listen to Mom and Dad and uh it it was uh it was not very good I mean she was getting into some real trouble and he came to me and he said brother Barry he said you're here to talk about families in our church here he said 'I want you to talk to my daughter and fix the problem and I said to him sir you cannot change the outcome in the Harvest we've got to go back a little bit here and we also have to begin to sew something better in her heart in order to get a better Harvest because we're not going to change the outcome in the Harvest time does that make sense and the third thing to obtain a different crop you got to sew different seeds every one of us can do that right we can seow better seeds whether it's in your marriage or your family or your work or your whatever uh we want to be able to sew the right seeds to get the right crop okay so brother brandom says again he's infinite he said certainly he knows you and what are you scared about now here's what I I I I I need to say this at the beginning here so that uh we have this underscored and he said he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world what are you worried about you've got the Holy Ghost sealed into the kingdom of God how many can say amen he said the church is scared and I'd say the world is scared he said but don't be scared fear not only believe that's what God wants he wants you to believe him he want you to trust him with all of your heart so there are things that are happening that you may not be able to understand there are things that are happening that will look very illogical and even very dangerous uh coming up in the world there's things that uh you know uh nations with their fingers on triggers uh that would have detrimental consequences uh in our world here but he says brother bam says a l lot of people are scared but he said don't you be scared I want you to only believe that's what brother bram's advice that's good advice for all of us to take now let's go back to Second Peter if you don't mind and if you have your Bibles here this is the one passage I want you to read with me here second Peter chapter 3 and: three now all of second Peter is about the end time all of second Peter is about end time prophecies and uh Peter is giving us basically uh how how this is going to go down uh in the first three verses here and I want to pick it up in verse three chapter 3: three knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust so this is how it's going to happen folks okay this is what Peter is saying this is not now but whenever this takes place when the day of the Lord comes here's how it's going to roll out okay there will be scoffers there will be people who say verse four where is the promise of he's coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation and for this they are willingly ignorant of that phrase in the Greeks willingly ignorant of it means they are delighted to be ignorant or unaware of what's coming there's a lot of people in our world who don't want to hear what you believe because then they would have to act on it they'd have to do something about it they would have to respond to what they are now being made aware of so they don't want to hear it and they really don't want you to come around and talk about it and so they're delighted to be unawares just like the people in Noah's day listen we leave that to Noah and his family and the people who want to hang around and try to dispute him but we're just going to carry on with our business just like it was in the days of Noah so is it today there are obvious glaring signs in our world that something's about to happen but you know what there's a lot of people saying you can look after that the government will take care of us the Marines are in place we'll just go on about our business and that's the wrong way to be thinking about our time right they are delighted to be unaware that by the word of God the heavens which were of old of and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water now this is an odd phrase this is odd the way it's worded whereby the world that uh that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved under the fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men now we don't normally put phrases like that but let me just paraphrase it for you just for a moment what Peter is telling us is that the same God who created the Earth out of the the water out of the ocean and raised up this Earth to where it is use that same water to destroy the Earth in the days of Noah that same God who created and then destroyed is also the same God who will destroy by fire that's what that's what he's simply telling us don't underestimate the fact that God who created the earth now will be reserved to judge it he will but this time he's not going to do it by water he's going to do it by fire so it's a promise that he's actually stating here in that passage verse 8 but beloved be not be not ignorant of this one thing that the day uh that that one day is with the Lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day and the Lord is not slack concerning his promise or lazy that word in the Greek it means lazy he's not slack concerning his promise as some men count laziness but he is longsuffering here to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and the day of the Lord will come as a thief in a night so there be a suddenness about this in the which the heavens and earth shall pass away with a great noise and I mean we've never seen the elements pass away we've never seen Stars shaken we've never seen the moon covered with blood we've never seen the phenomena that the bible promises is going to happen but it'll all happen and according to the first part of the verse it'll happen quickly it'll happen like a thief in the night and seeing then that all of these shall be dissolved now that word dissolved is a really important word and here it is and we won't have time to deal with all of it but it literally means listen now it means to unbind or to set something free something that was maybe Bound in prison is now let go am it means that something that is uh Bound by laws for instance if there are uh laws that bind the people like in the former Communist Regime or like in North Korea they have laws that bind the people uh and and it it they it deprives them of freedom and freedom of movement watch what Peter is promising he said that when all of these things will be dissolved so I want you to think now about our time that we're living in we're in the season where would you agree all of these things are coming to pass or about to come to pass right all of these things that I just read are about to come to pass or they're coming to pass in our time right God what what Peter is saying is that in that hour God's going to dissolve everything that is bound he's going hey thankfully he Unbound us from the systems of this world or he Unbound you from drugs or he Unbound you from denominational systems or he Unbound you from your own uh lust or your own fears or your own anxiety God's able to do that he's able to take whatever it is that holds you and dissolves that and let you go free Amen in the same way that Lazarus was set free from from the uh grave and the grave flows that bound him you also can be set free your children can be set free anybody out of the world can be set free nothing is powerful enough to hold them when God decides to dissolve people from the things that hold them back and even the systems and the governments of this world and the uh the elements of this world none of it will be able to hold uh the people of God back or the Earth back from coming into its place again he says all of that shall be olved what manner of persons then and this is the question that he asked how how in the world should we act how in the world should we conduct ourselves on a day-to-day basis and then he gives us an indication here in beginning in verse 12 looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of the Lord that word looking for it is the word expect so if if he's asking the questions here what manner of persons Al show Al should you also be we should be a people who are expecting something to happen not wondering my goodness what's happening what's what how in the world is all this going to come to pass and I don't know if God could do I don't know if it's going to happen and he he's he's not saying that he's saying you should be expecting and hastening unto the day of God where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for that's the same word we should be expecting new heavens and a new Earth We're not we're not only expecting God to to gather a bride we're expecting that God's got a home for us in another in another kingdom isn't that right that God's got another place for us God's got another body for me and we should not be just wondering that we should be expecting that that's what Peter says you want to know what kind of person you should be you should be a person who lives in expectation of the things that God has promised because that kingdom is coming closer all the time and God is revealing more of that to us in our time and we feel like we're coming closer to that and pretty soon we're going to be changed in a moment and taken into that Kingdom forever and there's a body waiting for us over there and there are all the saints of all the ages that are gathered over there on the other side we should not be just wondering about that we should be expecting that to happen just like we expect that tomorrow will be Thursday nevertheless we according to his promise look for we expect new heavens and a new Earth wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things wherefore since you expect those things to happen be diligent that you be may may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless now let's just go a little faster here through some of this Abraham was looking for it brother Bram said he said that Prophet knowing it was somewhere he knew that city was somewhere John saw it coming but Abraham thought it must be on the Earth right then why because he met mzc the king of that City and he gave him a tithe in other words he was expecting something he was looking for something to happen and he said the tree of life will be there and it's only for the Overcomers he said do you know know that it isn't for the denominational people it'll be for the Overcomers how many Overcomers do we have here tonight Overcomers are people who according to a prophet have a revelation that God will give you authority over the devil here it is right here it's a revelation that's what you need to pray that God gives you is a revelation of your identity so that you know exactly who you are and you can stand with authority over the things that bind you and say hey sorry we're living in a time that nothing can bind us we have been dissolved by the grace of God and we have been set free and he whom the sun sets free is free indeed all right that makes sense all right so that's just a little of of second Peter chapter 3 but now let's go a little bit further and you need to know this okay we're going to tuck this into our pocket here as we go forward brother Braham said you're standing completely a as if you've never sinned in the first place now you got to watch this quote I love this God don't even know he doesn't know right amen yeah right no that's what brother brandom said I'm only saying what the tape say so in other words let's put it this way let's just say that I'm the woman at the wh and I get a cross on the other side and I run into Jesus on the other side and she says oh lord it's so good to see you you remember me yes I remember you you were the woman from sikar yes I was the woman with with four husbands I sorry I don't remember that I remember you but I don't remember yeah you told me that I had four husbands and the one I was living with was not my husband now and I I was a woman who couldn't even come to the well because I was a sinner and all the other sister I I'm awfully glad you're here I'm sorry I don't know what you're talking about oh yeah yeah yeah I was the woman that that ran into town nobody would have anything to do with me and I I ran back into town and got everybody to come out yes I remember that but I don't remember anything about the the the husbands that you had you know why because God don't even know the things you put underneath the blood God doesn't even know it's in the sea of his forgetfulness read on you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son or a daughter of God in other words that's the seed that God placed in you to look for something at the Harvest Time right you're washed your old book of divorcement is put away absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God it's out of existence You're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ therefore why should we be afraid rather I think we should be a people who expect good things to happen Don't Be Afraid don't be afraid of what's Happening even if it looks pretty dark and confusing and illogical don't be afraid because you've been predestinated as a member of the bride of Christ brother Ram says it again he says God by predestination brought this seed that was in you to life he said and expressing itself cuz that's what seeds do you don't need to instruct seeds you don't need to educate seeds right seeds seem to know what to do right from the very beginning even when they're not doing anything right you put them in the right place in the right environment with the right elements you know what and they know what to do you don't need to say 12 steps for pumpkin seeds to produce pumpkins you don't need to do that right they just know and here's what brother Braham says that God by his predestination brought that seed that was in me to life and it's expressing itself and on top of all that he said it's over come it doesn't Express itself down there in the Bog or the swamp he said it's getting up to express itself and neither did you in your sin and adultery and everything that you lived in he didn't Express Christ back then right you expressed the nature of your father and mother as a sinner I don't know about you but I did he said but you didn't Express nothing but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to express itself into life and now you're in the presence of Christ with the sunlight and it brought out what you really was in the beginning glory to God and you know where we see the real me is in the Harvest right that's where we see the real me and you know what that's where we see the real you yes is in the Harvest Time all right now look ju let me let me just let me it's 10 to 10 10 to 10 in Virginia time the first PLL second uh healing second pull prophesying so here's brother Bram he's explaining to us how God has brought him through these phases of ministry he says now we're at the end and and this is what we're talking about here is the Harvest and he said remember that third pole was the opening of those Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word over all of these years let me graphically put it out here because I'm a graphic person and he says the third pole had these parts to it they it was the opening of the word and the manifestation of the sons of God and and that's how that's how it all happens under this last day Ministry hisory and he under that under that manifestation here we had a son of God who manifested the character of Christ in all of these areas right you're you're following the board here I'm just kind of summarizing it all for you in creation when he spoke to squirrels into existence and I I talked to brother George Smith and I I said brother George and sister Rebecca you know she was there when brother BR brought those squirrels home the ones that were spoken into existence and I said what did you do with them I me I mean we'd tend to mount them right or we at least tend to photograph them and put them on social media I mean that's the least you could do she said we ate him that's why he went hunting in the first place and and this the storm spoken out of existence and all of these examples here when you think about it listen no one was there when brother Bram spoke those squirrels into existence right there are no pictures there are no Witnesses and I'll say this to you he's either really right or he's really wrong one or the other in telling these stories brother braham's either really right or really wrong I believe he's really right amen because I think this is what God wanted to display in the character of an overcomer in this last day and did it through an adopted son and and I believe that's that's what we're looking at here and then of course preaching to the total LW so there's a there's an element of witness to the world in just you being here in the last day right with the expectation you have in your heart and people look at you and they say you're different my goodness you're different you don't have metal stuck in your body you don't have tattoos everywhere uh you don't like the music everybody else likes you you love going to church you rejoice when someone dies you people are odd you people are really weird and we say thank you because that is a compliment to us so let's focus for a moment here and I I I use this diagram a lot because in the last days obviously the center of attention is Christ right he's at the center of everything and he's causing everything to take place as it is and these elements are also included on the stage if you like of the last day now here's the reality and I don't know where you all are but when this all happens so when this all winds up you're going to be in one of those bubbles or another yeah there's nobody nobody is not included here unbelievers Jews church members bride everybody's included here so you just want to be sure you're in the right bubble you want to be sure you're in the right place right cuz you're you're going to be affected by end time events one way or the other so I I added a little bit more to this this circle here and I the other bubble I added in was the foolish virgins because we were looking at the foolish virgins and versus the church versus the bride and that's that's another study here but let's look at it here the bride plays its part in Revelation 10 because it was not Revelation 10 was not just about brother brandom verse 7 but Revelation 10 stops at verse 11 so verse 8 to 11 says that John took the book and ate the book and prophesied again amen right and you know what that's our part isn't it so then we we know that Israel comes into view and what's interesting is that all the nations of the world gather against Jerusalem to battle and I think with a mere casual glance you can see how that's possible in our time there's a lot of people I mean I have I have the count of the votes of the nations against Israel and there's very few on the pro side most everybody's moved over to the against side and so we're almost at a point where that's fulfilled according to Zechariah it's extremely interesting uh to to look at Zechariah 14 and how accurate it is then also the the world had to become like the days of Sodom that's what God allowed to happen in this last days will we'd all agree with that and then National Powers I mean you could start anywhere on the map the United Nations or China and Russia what's happening in Europe and and so forth all of those things are important the the the foolish virgins are described in Matthew chapter 25 you know coming out of the church out of that last day and brother ramam said it's all connected together that's what's interesting they're not all separate entities here but they are connected the events that cause this are all connected together he said God deals with the Jews he said uh as individuals not as a nation uh s sorry as a nation he said Israel is ready to receive the spirit when Elijah and Moses appears Revelation 11 and he says Israel comes to its Homeland and so forth but we're individuals so God deals with us a little bit differently right but uh but but God's dealing with everybody and they're all connected there there's all of these all of these elements are connected uh geopolitically if you like in the world now watch see the angel of the Lord is on the earth now and he's moving around fixing everything for the coming of the Lord wow who knew it's the same angels that heard the sin when they went down to Sodom we've come down to see whether these things are so wow well the same Angels they know how it all happens right all right so let's do it all right so the same Angels arrive and they arrive at lot's house right and there're all right you come on over here you you stand over here for a second if you will you come on I need you be ready be ready all right so this is lot Andy family right so the Angels causing this saying you guys go out of town all right your lot's rebellious Sons you you you can stay right there because you and Sodom all you guys are going to burn all right so you can stay right there so the angel is making sure that the right ones are out and the other ones are left where they are that's that's not a coincidence something's making that happen guys you want to come and have your seat here one stayed with Abraham the elect and the other one was he said he went down to Sodom and the angels so forth and preached well all right let's let's here's what brother mam I think is saying that the angel of the Lord is on earth now so right now he's saying he's saying all right I if you don't mind yeah be ready you got to be ready okay we only got an hour here I need you over here and I need you and come on I need you I can't pick you up you're too big you sit right here I need you there America is a big country so I got to move at a certain distance here and the Angel's moving things around you may think that you stumbled into this church and you know you made a decision based on a job or something else Hey listen the angel knows what he's doing the angel knows a little bit about things that are happening in another realm than what you know the Angel's able to place you the a Angel's able to uh you know move people around and this this Bo no now you this boy meets a certain girl because a family visits and then all of a sudden they're married you know I recently I talked about that in my own church and how my boys married uh you we were led to go to the church that I Pastor now Hickory Bible Tabernacle and you know my boys all married girls in that church and you know I'd say now my boys are pretty glad that they that I felt led to go to that church and and back when I went to that church back when I went there all the boys were not marrying age but you know what it was I believe that the angel of the Lord wanted me in a certain place and that place the boys in a certain place and then these young girls are being raised a certain way and you know all of a sudden there's a blend there and we think hey don't ever think that's coincidental God is moving you around just exactly where he wants you to be and you should just maintain the you can go back to your seats there guys you should you should maintain that sensitivity to the Holy Spirit to follow what he wants you to do and where he wants you to be because this is what brother braham's telling us it's a moving time it's a fixing everybody on the platform on the St AG where God wants you to be that's exactly right well now think a little higher I believe that God brought those Jews back from all those countries back to Israel when when they had nothing when they had nothing and the angel was watching over Israel and they won battles against all the Arab Nations that were surrounding them that vowed to push them into the sea and they were so desperate back in that day there's a a biography of eer viman who was the head of the Israeli Air Force and he said when they would fly up and practice bombing runs in their planes he said they would have 10 lb sacks of flour on the floor of the plane and they would drop those sacks of flour out to mimic bombs to see where they'd land because they could not waste their ammunition on practice runs and it became so desperate for Munitions and help that that finally they sent goldem Myer over to Nixon when all the other nations shut the door on Israel back in that day and Nixon said we are now vowing to help Israel and I believe that's that believe God blessed America for uh those responses because you're always blessed in relation to how you treat the Fig Tree you're always blessed in how you treat Israel and and I believe that the angel of the Lord orchestrated those events I believe also that those Jews allowed to come were allowed to come back to Israel I I I was around when the Soviet Union uh collapsed in the sense that the doors came open it was a unheard of event unexpected event but two things happened when the when the Soviet Union fell number one the message went in now PE now the message had access to the Believers that were in Russia and I'll guarantee I've been there many times there are lots of really good Believers in Russia but they were not allowed to have the message prior to the fall of the Soviet Union and the second thing happened was the Jews got out and they came back to Israel again uh in droves and there was nothing could hold them back I believe that was a uh the hand of the angel of God but the world had to be like Sodom and gomore didn't it and I believe that there are things that were orchestrated in our world because you know what from the Garden of Eden until Woodstock I mean things were normal pretty well men knew they were men they worked women knew they were women they kind of look after the family right and were keepers at home all of a sudden in the 60s everything went nuts right yes I don't believe that's a coincidence that's right I believe the world had to be like Sodom and Gomorrah in the last day there are many many things that we could illustrate here uh you know Hitler and musini and uh there was men raised up who had a certain mindset and had a certain uh uh you know desire to do things that were fulfilling scripture not saying that they were right but I believe that God allowed uh you know the different uh uh conditions to exist within countries for uh these kind of men to take power there has to be a reason why I mean this is more modern here here's uh you know Secretary of State Anthony blinkin and uh Mr abas who was the head of the uh PLO and they're sitting there prior to a news conference that they're having that's why they're kind of looking casual there and uh you know they're they're about to discuss things here about the uh Jewish conflict there in in Gaza but you know what's interesting is the background the background is a picture of the Temple Mount because this has always been about Jerusalem don't think it's about Gaza Gaza looks like parts of the Arizona wilderness I've been over there it's nothing but rocks and dirt and uh they don't have cactuses the only difference but I will tell you it's a wasteland they're not they're not worried about the Arab people are not worried about Gaza itself they're worried about Jerusalem that's always the center of attention over there it's a center of Prophecy for this day and if you go to Zechariah the emphasis is on Jerusalem not on Gaza that's right I believe the angel of the Lord allows that so at the end of the ages we have a cycle a distinct change begins to take place where the church goes into apostasy leoty and darkness and a judgment cycle begins right don't need to belabor that point we know that's true we also know too that the bride enters into what's identified as the bride age how many believe that we're living in a time where uh God begins to deal exclusively with the bride of Christ with an understanding with an understanding that is not parallel by any other age or let me say it this way God does not hide things from us God hid things for us God's a great Hider and he doesn't hide things from us he hid things for us so there were certain things that remain hidden All Through the Ages for us in the last day to know isn't that right and and God God allowed these great things to be revealed and are being revealed today in this bright age and I I listen I'm thankful that we I live in this in this last age I'll tell you what the cycle of restoration for Israel begins and we're we're well into that right we're well up the road in terms of the restoration of Israel and where they are and then fourthly the Antichrist begins to Rise To Rule and and it's not it's it's not in the way that many people thought but he comes in the Bible says with flatteries so he's not going to come in as a beast but we know what his nature truly is all right so I chat a lot with Andrew and different Brothers you know about things that are happening in our time and always in January I'm always curious about what people are are saying about the main events of last year and then what's going to happen ahead now they're not prophets right people in Media or government or not profits but I always think it's interesting what they are predicting what they're saying about what's what's important what's coming and I thank God for a profit just about every day because otherwise you'd be guessing and probing like everybody else in the world and I found this diagram now I want you to take a look at the diagram for a minute in the it it's kind of divided into four sections here and uh let me see if I can I can't I can't do this right no not in these screens on the top part there you got an hourglass that's a time uh time sequence there and the the idea conveyed is that uh time is running out and and that's what they want to imply over over here you have Mr zalinski and Mr Putin there and they're representing the struggles that are going on it's all about bombs and ammunitions and so forth and you have Mr Trump up here and uh this is the the Warfare scene now did you guys enlarge that for me okay okay so let's go down a notch here I thought it was interesting that they put these moons here as well that uh you know represent cycles and uh I thought it was interesting here we have uh medical technology and things related to DNA on this on this quadrant here over here is technology we'll talk a little bit more about technology in a second here and then down here on the bottom we have I I think this is Mr uh B President Biden and this is uh Mr Z in China China and uh we have all the manufacturing and all that stuff over here and over here you have uh and I think this is Biden because we have all of the uh you know the uh global warming and things like that you know and it was it was interesting all right so bring it back to regular size here for me so there what what the article was about was talking about all of these important quadrants in this diagram here but what I thought was really interesting when I looked at it long enough is what's in the middle what's in the center of this diagram what is it that they would have deem most important here for 2024 Ballot Box wow really a Ballot Box why in the world do we have a Ballot Box in the middle of what's going to happen in 2024 well I did a count and in 20124 there are 109 election events that are going to take place in 40 different nations which are going to affect over half the world's population in a dramatic way I did the count meaning that by the end of this year we could see a dramatic shift in just about half the population of the world aligning with a different governing power than what they are aligned with Now put on your seat belt 202 24 is going to be an interesting one but watch this in the second coming of the Lord Brother Braham says no matter how well we try to take care of our physical being or to take care of the church there's coming a time when all these things shall pass away you're not in other words you're not going to stop the passage of time that changes all of these things God's got it predetermined God's got it set and you know what you're a part of it and all of it's going to happen around you you just need to sit there and be in expectation for the good things that God has promised for the people of God Amen but there's a lot of stuff going to happen here and brother bam says no matter how you try to protect it no matter how you try to protect your church no matter how you try to protect your political position or your party you know what it's all going to happen God's way because God's the one that's got his hand on the remote right isn't that right all right so there are there are all of these elections that are going to take place and you might think wow it doesn't make much difference let me show you one that does and it's this one and this election's already passed it's the election for the governing power of Taiwan and and despite China's best efforts the opposition party got in in Taiwan and they're the people who are leaning towards separation now they're they're having to do a uh you know a a cooperation with other smaller political parties but uh this man Mr lie uh he is the head of the party that has been uh promoting separation now here's the thing here's the thing you need to know that our government has pledged to support Taiwan in the event of being attacked act to the point where they would put soldiers on the ground in that battle from America American soldiers on the ground in that battle that will change your life that will change things but this is a big deal because now you have the two superpowers that have resources to fight aiming at one another if this thing actually comes to pass that election is over it's already passed the other one will happen in November that will change a lot of things in our world depending on what happens in that outcome right the American election that'll happen plus all the other elections that'll take place I mean this gets really interesting if you're older than 45 this is the way we viewed the world as we were growing up right some of you old folks that are sitting here who don't want to admit you're old we had two ways of looking at the world and and one was dominated by America and democracy and the other part of the world was do at by communism Russian and Chinese communism different brands and so forth but we were kind of supported on two two uh we we existed with two points of view if that M does that make sense where else do you find you know an end time event what what's scriptural about this well here we find in the end time Daniel saw the whole thing supported by two different feet iron and Clay two things that don't mix right and did it work nope they never Blended together so therefore you have a a a distinction you have separate things and I love this diagram because it has the church ages right here on the bottom of it and all the candles are lit here we're at the end and it's just interesting so here's the diagram brother bandam Drew now he didn't have PowerPoint like we have but somebody made notes and I have a sister in my church who was there uh when brother brandom Drew this diagram and this is a uh a sketch of how he drew it back in that day same idea here is the here's the Capstone and as the Jews are returning in this last day because if this is the end of the Gentile dispensation here uh the Jews return in 1948 up until now and the Capstone comes down and smites this image of De feet here so now we have a change and so that's why the the Russian system broke up like it did and all the rest of it there but uh we find that uh brother Brandon places all of this at the end of the church ages Harvest Time right so what what I said to you in the beginning was was a whole bunch of things that happen in the Harvest time because all the seeds are come to maturity everything's come to maturity at the end time so we see the real thing at the end time and here we have ready for two prophets that come out three and a half years in this in this section over here uh and and two prophets that come to Israel according to Revelation 11 I know I'm going fast I'm going to leave you this PowerPoint so you can go back and look at it and look at all the quotes and so forth uh whenever you want to but it's really interesting now what's happening in the world I'll be very brief here that there are other groups now that are rising up because those two superpowers are not uh are not in control as they were so there are other superpowers that are merging together and I'll guarantee you all of them are merging together against America and they're merging together against Israel and that's what's important so we have Brazil and China South Africa India and Russia that's why they call it bricks and they had a summit just recently where they all got together now these people are very different the governments are very different how they make their money is very different and they don't really agree much except on this one thing they hate Israel and number two they don't want to be under the American umbrella in life and joining them this year is going to be five other nations Ethiopia Iran Egypt UAE and Saudi Arabia and those 10 nations with all the money they have and the oil resources they have they have more buying power than all the other nations of the earth and so they're going to they're going to cause an influence in our world because they're going to have uh as of January 1st 2024 this is going this group is going to change and there's more people wanting to be a part of that because they don't want to be a part of the American system anymore and they certainly agree with their hatred of Israel what I'm saying to you is that a lot of times you may not even see all of these things happening because if you're watching the media they're only going to tell you what they want you to know but modern events are made clear by CNN no it's not modern events are made clear by prophecy aren't they and so there are things that are happening in the background here that we need to be aware of very important things and brother Ram says and here's the gospel he says come and give a mercy call throughout the Nations for years and we've turned it down and now working the devil taking his seat turning the hearts of those political men against Israel hold it now take a look at the year he says this this is 1956 seven friends that is 66 years ago and brother Braham saying look all these political men are going to be against Israel they're looking over they're hooking up Over Yonder with the Arabs and he said we're as good as gone we'll sink just as sure as the world he says I love my nation I love what it stands for but brother I love my Lord above everything and I love to see my nation to its knees humbling itself but I'm afraid we'll never do it we're at the end time why a mixed multitude got in there so go back to the bubbles now you have you have Israel right you have uh you know the the the bride you have the nations of the earth you have the church foolish virgins and all all those bubbles around and Christ is at the center of it all and all of it's been prophesied and you're living in the day when it's all coming to pass and you can sit there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled and you happen to be in the right bubble you should be thanking God every day you wake up in the morning yes sir all all right can I have a couple of more minutes I have no idea where we are all right let's look this is an amazing statement and I never noticed it until the other day brother time and he said lots of people fail to have discernment about the times we live in but he said as we see the time that we live in there must be something somebody's overlooking somewhere what a statement for a prophet to say there's got to be something going on that you know everyone's missing my my goodness what's happening because God had never let these things happen without giving us a sign and you know what he's telling the people that that's not God's way God always gives a sign wake up everybody there's a sign that's been put in front of you right a prophet hello a prophet that came in the last day and you know what signs do they point you to something signs are not the destiny signs point you to something and brother br's pointing us to something but there's a whole lot of people sitting there saying somebody's overlooking something somewhere that was a great statement so can I show you something here you're probably not expecting the last bubble that I would put on the board would be the technical order of things the digital Revolution now I we don't have we don't have a whole lot of time to go into this but I'll give you a little heads up up next Wednesday night this February 7th a week from the day in my church I've got one of my sons who's a digital guy to give us a an expose on how digital media affects you and I will tell you how it does it really real simply I I don't know a thing right I'm over 30 trust me I don't know what I'm talking about that's why I'm getting him to do it he's he's trained in that area this is what the article said in the economist it said with Ruth ruthless efficiency social media can deliver unlimited amounts of the content that influencers create or Inspire that stopped me because I didn't know what an influencer was and that makes the combination of influencers and social media algorithms perhaps the most powerful form of advertising ever invented I Micah could probably get up here and rattle off what that what that actually means and if trust me I'm over 30 I don't know but what what my son is going to do is talk about these two things influencers and algorithms and how they're tailored to make you attracted to bound to social media all the time and I will assure you it's a very powerful thing it's a very powerful thing now it's from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so there are good things that you can get done and there's there's other things that you can't get done so I was asking him what's an influencer and he said you know it's those guys that uh you know like on YouTube you get on there and they'll show you how to how to make biscuits from scratch right the old women would tell you how to make biscuits from scratch and she' get in there and and uh get her hands in the bowl and she's mixing that up and you're and she said I've got some links below and you you click on the link Amazon bang mail two days later you got all the supplies you need and you're making biscuits just like her because you've been influenced right I said oh wow I know what an influencer is because I only look at two things on YouTube and one thing is sermons and the second thing is woodworking brother Brian you'd be proud of me and I I I look at woodworking things and these guys are 10 tools every worker woodworker must have right and so I'm a sucker I mean I go right down into that trap and I I'm looking I'm looking at it and uh guy's doing this Nifty thing with a and I've been struggling with that you know I almost lost my some my fingers with that and he's got and a link is below in the hey click on that bang Amazon two days I got it over in my shop and I'm using that cuz I've been influenced now my algorithm which is my friend whether I know it or not sees the kind of gullible person I am and says let's throw a million gadgets at brother Barry and let's see how he reacts to that so now I'm sitting there saying who knew all these people were out there with all these gadgets whoa it's like I died and went to heaven this is a powerful thing it's a powerful thing powerful to the point of no matter how we as Christians try to influence this great big thing out there called the internet with all of its algorithms we're a minuscule part of that process so if all of us now all every every Christian in the world dedicated their life to being on the internet and clicking only on good sites you still wouldn't influence the cosmos it's way way way too big and powerful for that to change and there are people making decisions long ago about how this is all going to happen that's what's interesting and it's a frontier or a fight or a battle or a trap and we never saw coming and neither did we get a choice because how many of you adults that are here and teens that are here that don't have a phone and I'm not saying you should throw your phone away I'm not saying that at all but I'm saying that we're all involved and some of us are really involved to the point where this is today and I don't know if you saw this or heard this but this was powerful and I was following along this morning as this was F unfolding and I was doing some work and preparing for tonight but I was following this because this is a senate hearing and there are very powerful Senators here in this seated in this role right here and they they're they're doing the pledge the five top Executives for uh for Facebook and uh uh Snapchat and Instagram and so forth they were all there they were all there five of them were there uh Tik Tock were there and tick and talk were both there and they were these these five were standing there 1 2 3 4 5 and they were standing standing there and they were grilling them for the third time about uh their processes and about the effect of social media on young people and so on and by the way Florida just passed a law that you had to be 16 and over before you can use social media and everybody said wow they said it all together so today what would made this hearing very interesting is that in the audience it was filled with moms and dads of of children who had died because they picked up fenel on Facebook they they uh were involved in uh child pornography and they were involved in this that and the other thing and the parents of these of these children who had died are sitting back in the audience and they're listening to these Executives talk about how their one aim in life was to make lots of money and they they had internal documents that were leaked to the public and and and uh Mr Zuckerberg from Facebook said that we a fix a financial value on every young person in this country who uses Facebook anybody know what the amount is $270 and there were people in the audience who had t-shirts on and there it said I am worth more than $270 and in other words the system was designed to merchandise all of these young people that are in the world not only through meta but through all the other major venues as well I mean it was just extraordinary and I listened to a little bit of it and then at the end Mr Zuckerberg from Facebook or meta he got up and turned to those families and said to them I apologize for the death of your children we need to do more and so on and you know made a made a a token apology at least he made an apology but made a token apology and they blasted him after he made that apology and in other words there are real life consequences for this whole thing of influencers and algorithms and I made light of it just in a moment here about the woodworking but I'll tell you there are real consequences when kids go down that go down that slippery slope and they find themselves involved in things that they never thought they'd be involved in and parents and even message believers who get pulled down that slippery slope and find themselves in a place said never thought they'd be we have a responsibility as parents and grandparents to know what we need to know to help protect our children and to have wisdom to be able to use discernment in the time that we're living in because you know what it's here to stay it's just like brother bam said tubless tires and uh you know uh other other things that he said they're here to stay we're not going to do anything to change that and this is here to stay you know what you got to do you got to learn to navigate through Le oysa you got to learn to navigate through this season with wisdom wisdom from above now watch in James chapter 3 the wisdom that descendeth not from above is Earthly sensal and de devilish hold on now it's he James is describing two kinds of wisdom wisdom that is from above is this wisdom that comes from below is this but they're both called wisdom that's what's interesting there's a wisdom that's going to do you no good but there's a wisdom that comes from God but the world calls this wisdom because it lets them know how to replace the muffler in your car and it also lets you know how to you know buy drugs and it lets you know how to do all anything in the cosmos that you want to know watch and the fruit of righteousness is sown in in peace of them that make peace there is a there's a good fruit of wisdom that that produces righteousness but there's another kind of fruit that comes from the other use of so-called wisdom our answer to this whole problem is seeking wisdom from above not from Google cuz I got news for God doesn't even use it he doesn't he doesn't even have it because he doesn't need it huh this gets really interesting brother braham's telling us that the whole thing is going back to the way God intended it in the first place he sit up there in the British ice Fields he said they blast 500 ft down through the ice and there's palms and ferns I've been there I've been in Siberia and they have found the you know the woolly mammoth up there and so forth I've been right up where that in that area where that is and he said it showed it was once a Tropic and he said now it leans back the Earth leans back because of the blast in Noah's Day from the anti luian destruction this is 1964 I'm going to close here okay do you believe this is right come on he's either really right or really wrong one or the other there's kind of no halfway in in things he's saying here amen and I believe the very thing that threw it out of its cycle then is ready to throw it back in its cycle now am man destroys himself by his knowledge and God destroys nothing so we're at we're at the end we're at this har we're in this Harvest cycle where the whole thing is there's remember now there's a gathering into the kingdom and a gathering out of everything else right that's what you're looking at now the real separation that matters it's h is happening okay okay everybody with me last quote Joshua said now you're going to see the glory of God I think it's the last quote I think it is Joshua said now going into the promise and crossing over you're going to see the glory of God for they hung the pillar of fire over them but don't let it get out of your sight because you've never passed this way before good advice I believe there's an exper I believe there's an experience for the church I love it how brother bam connects that with this I love that when he says same thing today you know he makes statements like that I believe there's an experience for the church that's something the church should remember let's move outwards uh towards Jordan tonight maybe you've never passed this way before but let's pass this way God's here leading you he's here to lead you if you've never passed this way to it be unfair for God to say I hope you make it he didn't do that he came to lead us that's what's talking to your heart and telling you to do it is the holy spirit second part of the quote now I can see the people as they went marching on the angel of the Lord went into Jordan before them and the angel of God oh I love this the angel of God will lead you every step of the way say it with me every step of the way say it again every step of the way that's his promis God sometimes you think the trials are heart and I'm not I'm not minimizing some of the trials some of you are going through because the pendulum swings this way and this way and sometimes you feel real secure about things secure about your job all your kids are at at the dining room table and eating dinner with you and your health is good and your boss says to you you'll always be you'll always have a job here buddy but all of a sudden the pendulum swings the other way and the doctor comes in and looks at you and pushes the file out and says I'm afraid we can't do anything else or you see a bunch of Chinese people walking around the plant you realize your job's not so secure anymore you'll pray differently in those valleys than you will you will on then you will on the mountaintops I'll guarantee you'll pray differently down here that's why God allows the down here sometimes you think trials are hard God ain't need no hurry you're the only one that's in a hurry we love results God loves the journey we love results God loves the process that process is very important you're the only one that's in a hurry he let Dani get right to the Lim's Den before he overcome just rise up and start walking by faith God I believe you I'm Bound for the promised land you promised it to me and I'm expecting that that's what Peter tells us to believe like in the last day have have anticipation have expectation on your mind in your heart because some of you have problems and you think they're as big as anything in the world look at the screen with me some of you think your problems are bigger than anything else they're big as the Earth and my goodness how am I over going to overcome I'm going to end with this but some of you think your problems are so big and I mean there's Ain't No Way ain't no solution to that but you know God created all of these didn't he let's just step out a little bit further from that and look at this screen here and realize that God also is bigger than the earth isn't he follow the Earth with me if you will because when we go further the Earth is just a pixel there that's the sun who hey who created the Sun same God right same God that created all of it and sometimes we think it's the biggest thing in the world our problems are the biggest thing in the world and in reality they're not can I go a little bit further here hey look here's the sun over here and these are some of the other planets that they know about that are in the universe there Arcturus well let's go a little bit farther look the sun is not even visible it's a pixel over here and you can't even see it it's over here under this little thing and and the Earth is long gone long gone in comparison to the God who created all of it brother brandom said father he said you're you're the Lord our strength a very present help in time of trouble and father May that arm of of a Believer May that one that that prays May that arm of Faith that'll go beyond this sin cursed World Reach Out beyond the moon and the stars until it touches His Garment way up yonder and May there come a voice from saying Heaven saying I am the Lord that Health thee and I'm Jehovah sh I'm a very present help in a time of trouble I'm here to help you let me tell you your faith can raise up it can reach farther than the the the circumstances of this world and the problems that you face your faith can reach beyond your hurt your faith can reach beyond your confusion your faith can reach beyond your solutions that you try to come up with to figure out how am I going to fix this and how am I going to work that and how am I going to supply for my family or whatever else your armor of faith can reach beyond all of that and touch the God who created it all amen and believe that let my friend believe that God is watching over you watching over this bride in the last day that uh that we're living in brother B said he gives us this advice commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over don't build up the pressure let off pressure will you say I'm worried brother B he I just don't know let off the pressure and cast your cares upon him because he cares for you he said don't you worry about your cares that's his business when you give your cares to God in faith and in prayer they're his business now not yours and you go on as if that was not as if it was over because you know what God loves it when you thank him in the midst of a trial as opposed to thanking him when the answer is obvious when you begin to thank God in the valley when you begin to thank God before he does anything visible on your behalf he loves that I mean he loves that because he knows somehow you believe he's going to work this out you know he's going to fix this you know he's going to come to your Aid somehow even if you can't see it or feel it or nothing seems to be coming together when you're in the middle of that trial or in the slew of despondency and you're thanking God for his mercies and you're thanking God for his grace and you're thanking God for the solution amen God must love that even more than when he does something obvious and then you're saying I thank you Lord I knew you'd do it people of Faith are thanking God no matter what the circumstances are like because we're not governed by circumstance in the Harvest Time that's the kind of people God's looking for let's stand to our feet let's stop right there
