[0:00] luke chapter 2 i'm going to be reading
[0:02] verses 1 to 14
[0:04] and
[0:06] i am excited about some of the things
[0:08] i've been studying the way the lord's
[0:09] dealt with my heart we've had several
[0:10] requests for more parts on abraham i'm
[0:13] sure we'll have opportunity to minister
[0:15] on him as we continue
[0:17] to minister the gospel it's hard to
[0:19] avoid abraham as you preach the word of
[0:21] god
[0:22] but i've been studying some things the
[0:23] lord's been doing with my heart and it's
[0:25] december 1st
[0:27] it's after thanksgiving this is when
[0:29] some people can finally start to think
[0:30] about christmas even though they push it
[0:33] on us right around halloween time
[0:35] but i want to speak on a number of
[0:37] different subjects during the month of
[0:38] december and maybe we could call it a
[0:40] series of sermons
[0:42] deriving some inspiration from the
[0:44] events of the birth of christ uh so you
[0:47] could call it a christmas christmas
[0:48] series and i'll give you my title here
[0:50] in a little bit
[0:51] uh but i wanted just to give you that uh
[0:53] give you that at the outset and begin
[0:55] reading in luke chapter 2
[0:58] verses 1 to 14 and there's a wonderful
[1:00] atmosphere here tonight so i just feel
[1:01] very comfortable
[1:03] and it came to pass in those days he's
[1:05] going to be reading luke chapter 2
[1:06] verses 1 to 14. and it came to pass in
[1:09] those days that there went out a decree
[1:11] from caesar augustus that all the world
[1:13] should be taxed and this taxing was
[1:16] first made when cyrenius was governor of
[1:18] syria and all went to be taxed everyone
[1:20] into his own city and joseph also went
[1:23] up from galilee out to of the city of
[1:25] nazareth and into judea unto the city of
[1:29] david which is called bethlehem because
[1:31] he was of the house and lineage of david
[1:34] to be taxed with mary his espoused wife
[1:36] being great with child and so it was
[1:39] that while they were there the days were
[1:40] accomplished that she should be
[1:42] delivered and she brought forth her
[1:44] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[1:45] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[1:47] manger because there was no room for
[1:49] them in the end
[1:50] and there were in the same country
[1:52] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[1:54] watch over their flock by night and lo
[1:56] the angel lord came upon them and the
[1:58] glory the lord shone round about them
[2:00] and they were so afraid the angel said
[2:02] unto them fear not for behold i bring
[2:04] you good tidings of great joy which
[2:06] shall be to all people for unto you is
[2:09] born this day in the city of david a
[2:11] savior which is christ the lord there
[2:14] shall be a sign unto you you shall see
[2:16] you shall find the babe wrapped in
[2:18] swaddling clothes lying in a manger and
[2:21] suddenly there was with an a with the
[2:23] angel a multitude of heavenly hosts
[2:25] praising god and saying glory to god in
[2:28] the highest on earth peace good will
[2:31] toward men
[2:32] god bless you can be seated
[2:36] as i mentioned i'm wanting to uh if god
[2:38] would lead us and
[2:40] i want to be very very strict uh to find
[2:42] his leading uh there's maybe a lot of
[2:44] things in the word of god that you could
[2:46] give a speech on or that you could print
[2:47] out statements on or just do a word
[2:50] search and print out a number of
[2:51] scriptures but that would not
[2:53] match the need
[2:55] that you have in your life the spiritual
[2:57] need because only the anointing and only
[2:59] what is inspired in a season is what's
[3:02] going to feed your soul and so i don't
[3:03] want to just because it's december and
[3:06] we're heading towards a christmas
[3:07] celebration that we just speak on a
[3:09] subject
[3:10] i've never actually ministered on a
[3:12] series of services on christmas
[3:14] and i don't often just grab things that
[3:16] might seem to be relevant because of the
[3:18] season but god's impressed some things
[3:20] on me
[3:21] and i want to speak on the subject and
[3:22] then acknowledge just even at the outset
[3:25] that the subject of christmas and you
[3:27] could just be
[3:29] free to amend this if you agree and it
[3:30] won't disclose which side you might be
[3:32] on but christmas can be a controversial
[3:35] subject isn't that right
[3:37] and it's amazing that it can be but my
[3:39] goal in speaking on christmas is to lift
[3:42] up christ
[3:43] and to lift up the true meaning and to
[3:45] identify the true spirit of christmas so
[3:48] i'm not angling
[3:50] into taking a stand in the areas that
[3:52] might be controversial but just really
[3:54] identifying that as christians there's
[3:56] something that we can emphasize and
[3:59] something that's very real about the
[4:01] birth of christ and those are the things
[4:03] that we would like to do is to lift up
[4:05] christ
[4:06] in these things that we would minister
[4:08] and in the sermon the deity of jesus
[4:11] christ brother branham preaches this
[4:12] it's the first sermon that we have
[4:14] recorded
[4:15] in which he preaches on christmas day
[4:19] and i believe i have it there on the
[4:20] slide in the deity of jesus christ it
[4:22] says as it was in the days of noah
[4:25] so will it be in the coming of the son
[4:27] of man
[4:28] noah had some faithful ones in that day
[4:31] god god's got some faithful ones today
[4:34] and i just love this how he approaches
[4:36] this and i wanted to use this as a
[4:37] foundational statement the hour is
[4:40] coming this great drama setting men and
[4:42] women if the holy ghost is dwelling in
[4:44] you
[4:45] the christ that was born 1900 years ago
[4:48] came to manhood
[4:50] he never stayed in the cradle
[4:53] so you could already begin to recognize
[4:54] maybe a theme here and even recognize
[4:57] the the danger of some of the emphasis
[4:59] that we could put on christmas if we
[5:01] keep him in a manger you just keep him
[5:02] in a stable and so he's identifying that
[5:05] christ was born born in a manger as the
[5:07] scripture says but there was a
[5:09] trajectory a progression an evolution in
[5:12] his life where he came to manhood and i
[5:14] love that statement he never stayed in
[5:16] the cradle
[5:17] and he's expressing this to those who
[5:19] have the holy ghost
[5:21] so if we have the holiness we can't stay
[5:23] in a cradle we've got to grow to manhood
[5:26] and he says and today this is where he
[5:27] kind of begins to focus on the event of
[5:30] christmas and today that memorial of his
[5:32] birthday so this day the date he's
[5:34] preaching if you could see it on the
[5:35] opposite the other the first slide i
[5:37] think i even put it in our traditional
[5:40] uh christmas colors you can see preach
[5:42] this on christmas day
[5:44] and so he's thinking of this time the
[5:46] memorial of his birthday what did they
[5:47] do they get some tree cut it down make a
[5:50] christmas tree for the kitties he says
[5:52] that's all right i'm not kicking against
[5:54] that
[5:55] but the thing of it is they put more on
[5:57] the christmas tree than they do for
[5:59] christ
[6:00] kris kringle's all over the country who
[6:02] was he a german a catholic saint years
[6:04] ago an old man went about doing good and
[6:06] today it's become almost a worship so we
[6:09] can see he's he's bringing in a lot of
[6:11] different elements
[6:13] it's the memorial of christ's birthday
[6:15] but people cut down a tree and they give
[6:17] the preeminence to the tree they give
[6:19] preeminence to kris kringle and the um
[6:22] the teaching of christ's birth is kind
[6:24] of losing
[6:26] losing focus so he says
[6:28] it's become almost a worship that's
[6:29] right it's all right to tell the kitties
[6:31] or whatever you want to do as far as i'm
[6:34] concerned way i take that is he saying
[6:35] hey if you want to tell your kids about
[6:37] a kris kringle you want to you want to
[6:39] have a christmas trees he says i'm not
[6:40] kicking against that he said whatever
[6:43] you want to do as far as i'm concerned
[6:45] but he this is the emphasis but the real
[6:47] thing of it is
[6:49] it's so easy to fall in that rut on the
[6:52] other side and push christ
[6:55] and push out christ the real
[6:57] fundamentals of christmas
[6:59] notice
[7:00] he's identifying this rut on the other
[7:03] side so i would say if he's saying
[7:05] there's a rut on one side there's a rut
[7:06] on the other and there's these two
[7:08] different areas that you can fall into
[7:10] and he says and make and man take kris
[7:12] kringle instead of real christmas that's
[7:15] right no room for him in the end
[7:18] so just as it was in the time of his
[7:20] literal birth and whatever time of year
[7:22] that would have been we don't believe it
[7:23] was in the winter time we don't believe
[7:25] that it was on december 25th but as it
[7:28] would be in the springtime when rams are
[7:30] born and lambs are born
[7:31] that there was no room for him at the
[7:33] end and then once again here in the end
[7:35] time in the last days as mankind and his
[7:38] traditions and his theology has
[7:39] accumulated he says they put more
[7:42] emphasis on kris kringle or santa claus
[7:44] as we might call him
[7:45] instead of real christmas that there's a
[7:48] real truth to christmas and what
[7:49] christmas ought to be identifying he
[7:51] says they fall in on the other side and
[7:53] push out christ and he uses this phrase
[7:56] the real fundamentals of christmas
[7:59] so there are fundamentals of christmas
[8:01] he's identifying this as a on this
[8:03] christmas day in 1949 he identifies
[8:06] fundamentals of christmas
[8:08] and that would mean the the primary or
[8:10] something that's primary to christmas or
[8:12] original to christmas uh pertaining to
[8:15] the foundation of christmas if it's the
[8:17] fundamentals it's the primary principles
[8:20] or rules as it relates to christmas
[8:22] and and this is this is something that
[8:24] we ought to catch on there are
[8:26] fundamentals of christmas
[8:28] and that he's wanting to point to these
[8:31] primary
[8:32] foundational things as it relates to
[8:34] christmas time
[8:36] and there are many truths and i pondered
[8:39] this even this afternoon i started as i
[8:40] was pondering this i wanted to make this
[8:42] statement there's many truths uh
[8:44] pertaining to the birth of christ that
[8:46] are worth lifting up and you're like duh
[8:49] but i really just think there's even
[8:50] some things that are more uh
[8:53] really deep very rich there's types and
[8:55] shadows in the birth of christ there's
[8:57] many truths about
[8:59] him being born as a baby and the
[9:01] circumstances of his birth and all the
[9:03] many different prophecies that are
[9:05] fulfilled that are worth emphasizing
[9:08] that are worth lifting up and we could
[9:09] emphasize them on july 4th we could
[9:11] emphasize them uh in the month of may we
[9:14] could do it in september you could
[9:15] really do it any time
[9:17] and if you take time to do it in this
[9:18] season it's not inappropriate to ponder
[9:21] and think about what was happening when
[9:23] this babe was born
[9:25] i think it's a good thing to do so
[9:26] there's many uh principles and shadows
[9:29] there's even really beautiful types
[9:31] in the birth of christ even the elements
[9:33] of these things that we read about and
[9:35] joseph and mary and the taxation and the
[9:38] city of bethlehem and there's no room at
[9:39] the end he's lying in a mange and
[9:41] wrapped in swaddling clothes there's a
[9:43] lot of rich truths pertaining to these
[9:45] things
[9:46] and just think of the different
[9:47] prophecies that are fulfilled when he
[9:48] comes as a baby they're born in
[9:50] bethlehem and so there's meaning behind
[9:53] these prophecies there's meanings in
[9:55] these events
[9:56] but i want to just ask this question
[9:58] just for you to ponder it and i am going
[10:00] to answer it generally
[10:02] before we go into a more foundational
[10:05] subject before we enter into even what
[10:07] our title is
[10:08] but why why has christmas become so
[10:10] controversial
[10:13] it's important it's it's interesting to
[10:14] think about it just how controversial it
[10:17] has become because to be anti-christmas
[10:19] is just not it's not just an atheist
[10:22] sentiment
[10:23] right
[10:24] and maybe this is new for some of us
[10:26] it's not just the atheists that rail
[10:28] against christmas and hate christmas and
[10:29] despise christmas uh there there's
[10:32] there's another side to it that's more
[10:33] of a religious fervor and and more of an
[10:35] indignation uh that would be more uh
[10:38] religious uh not atheistic but those who
[10:41] would uh would not like it and would be
[10:43] against it so it's controversial not
[10:46] just because they're trying to take
[10:47] christ out of christmas and they want to
[10:49] take away uh and you shouldn't say merry
[10:51] christmas you should say happy holidays
[10:53] it's it's not even that anymore there's
[10:56] actually those that even believe very
[10:58] fervently in christ but would be
[11:00] anti-christmas and anti-christmas
[11:02] sentiment
[11:03] and so the con the christmas
[11:06] christmas is it's very easy to say this
[11:08] way christmas is controversial due to
[11:11] its truth
[11:13] because of what it stands for it's
[11:14] controversial you say it's certainly
[11:16] controversial to the atheist or the
[11:18] agnostic who denies that there is a god
[11:20] or does not believe there's a god let
[11:22] alone one that would send his son to be
[11:23] born of a virgin birth and a manger so
[11:26] christmas is controversial just because
[11:28] of its truth but it's also controversial
[11:30] because of its myths
[11:33] and that's where my title is today
[11:35] christmas myths and i missed a really
[11:37] good lispy pun and i could have just
[11:39] called it chris
[11:40] smith's and brother michael suggested
[11:43] that i should have had an outline of
[11:44] mike tyson
[11:45] uh there behind it
[11:47] and so we're preaching on christmas
[11:49] uh christmas myths and i know now i'm
[11:51] gonna list my way through this as we
[11:53] refer to it
[11:55] but and that's what i want to begin to
[11:56] speak on are christmas myths
[11:59] christmas myths
[12:00] right
[12:02] and and i'm not going to be able to get
[12:03] into those myths necessarily this
[12:05] evening but it's something i want you to
[12:06] begin to ponder what are the myths as it
[12:08] relates to christmas and how is it that
[12:10] mythology has somehow been blended in
[12:12] with christianity and made the gospel uh
[12:16] mysterious to some and controversial to
[12:18] others and even caused some to reject
[12:20] truth or to reject certain things all
[12:23] based upon a mythology
[12:25] it's starting saints pray for me my
[12:27] tongue's starting to get real fat
[12:30] but there's uh there's things that i
[12:32] want to begin to identify and it may be
[12:33] something we could just touch on very
[12:35] quickly in a future service but before
[12:37] we begin to drill down on some of these
[12:39] christmas myths i wanted to just take a
[12:41] foundational
[12:43] some foundational subjects some
[12:44] principles maybe not subjects but just
[12:46] words and principles before going deeper
[12:48] into the myths of christmas
[12:50] and these things i want to identify
[12:52] tonight are
[12:54] principles that are worth understanding
[12:55] with respect to any subject matter
[12:58] as you approach anything in the word of
[12:59] god as you approach any subject matter
[13:01] with respect to god's truth and
[13:03] maybe even guiding principles if we're
[13:04] trying to figure something out in our
[13:06] own personal life that may not relate to
[13:08] supreme truth these principles are
[13:10] important to think of
[13:12] and i want to talk about polarization
[13:14] polarization
[13:16] and the importance of being balanced how
[13:18] things can become very polarized
[13:20] polarization and the importance of being
[13:22] balanced or the importance of balance
[13:24] and with respect to polarization just
[13:26] the idea of things being coming
[13:28] radicalized radicalization or even a
[13:30] dogma and are those terms that are
[13:31] familiar to you i'm going to expound
[13:34] upon them a little bit so i think
[13:35] they'll become more familiar
[13:36] and hopefully just kind of find their
[13:38] place in this subject matter
[13:40] and truth can be very muddied up
[13:42] obfuscated because of extremes
[13:46] and so you have a truth and then people
[13:48] can get very extreme with truth
[13:51] and when truth and when i say extreme i
[13:53] don't mean people being very fervent and
[13:55] passionate
[13:56] or zealous about truth because there's a
[13:59] we need to be zealous and there's a true
[14:01] zeal that is according to knowledge but
[14:03] what i what i mean is truth can be lost
[14:05] sometimes not in the zeal or proper
[14:08] enthusiasm for truth but in the extremes
[14:10] that people can take with respect to
[14:13] truth and what happens is these
[14:15] opposites begin to form the boundaries
[14:17] and so you have you have some people
[14:20] that look at something one way and they
[14:21] form a boundary and this is the line and
[14:24] they're in this extreme
[14:26] and then it happens on the other side
[14:28] we're going a little bit i'm going a
[14:29] little bit far in my my my slideshow i
[14:31] should have put the warning there my my
[14:33] even my christmas image of polarization
[14:35] you get that
[14:36] the pole polarization
[14:38] um
[14:39] and so i'm gonna get there i'm gonna get
[14:40] the polarization
[14:42] but in the um
[14:44] so the one side has a barrier this is
[14:46] how we believe this is how we see things
[14:48] and they become very entrenched in this
[14:51] and then on the other side
[14:53] and sometimes i'd even say it now i hope
[14:55] to come to it later almost in a counter
[14:58] measure
[14:59] people draw a line in another extreme
[15:02] and in some ways it almost tries it's
[15:04] almost trying to form like this
[15:05] counterweight to this side that's really
[15:07] extreme so this side other side gets
[15:09] really extreme and then this almost
[15:11] becomes the point at which um you have
[15:14] to either be on this side or that side
[15:16] and so if you if you have to gather
[15:18] behind this line or gather behind that
[15:20] line these lines actually then become
[15:22] barriers to truth
[15:24] because everybody's put in this camp and
[15:26] everyone's put into that camp and you
[15:27] either have to be on this side you have
[15:28] to be on that side and there's really no
[15:30] more liberty uh to even find the zeal
[15:33] for the truth because now it's been lost
[15:35] in the extremes
[15:37] fanaticism is maybe a word we could use
[15:39] for this it's an excessive or irrational
[15:42] zeal so i believe that we ought to be as
[15:44] christians zealous for truth
[15:46] but when it comes to the word of god and
[15:48] the thought and the logos of the word of
[15:50] god we ought not to be irrational or
[15:53] exceed beyond some boundary with our
[15:54] zeal so it's something if you're a
[15:56] fanatic you're wildly excessive it's
[15:58] wildly excessive devotion or wildly
[16:00] excessive enthusiasm
[16:03] to be a fanatic it's one who's marked by
[16:06] or motivated by extreme unreasonable
[16:09] enthusiasm and so i think that's
[16:11] something when we think about because we
[16:13] can be called fanatics and that doesn't
[16:14] necessarily mean you are one i think the
[16:16] phrase is oft you've been used before
[16:18] fanatic is just someone who loves jesus
[16:20] more than you
[16:22] and that a lot of times can be the truth
[16:24] a fanatic is one who is more zealous for
[16:26] truth but i'm not identifying a zeal for
[16:29] truth as it says something that is
[16:31] excessive or something that exceeds
[16:34] a particular it's irrational fanaticism
[16:38] is something that crosses a certain
[16:39] boundary
[16:41] fanaticism is something that exceeds it
[16:44] says it becomes excessive so if we could
[16:46] just think about that in order to go
[16:48] from zeal to to
[16:51] fanaticism you have to cross a boundary
[16:54] and that's that's where the extremes
[16:55] begin to be adopted is in these ex in
[16:58] these signs
[17:00] it's winston churchill that said a
[17:01] fanatic is one who can't change his mind
[17:04] and won't change the subject
[17:07] and so it's
[17:08] something it's irrational it's excessive
[17:10] it's too much
[17:12] so now on the subject of polarization
[17:14] i want to just ponder this for a moment
[17:16] and maybe briefly just express this
[17:18] polarization
[17:20] is the state of having different
[17:21] properties on different sides so this is
[17:24] where we could put that slide up of
[17:25] polarization
[17:27] it's the state of having different
[17:28] properties on different sides we have
[17:30] polar opposites and so we get the idea
[17:33] of pole it's the poles even in the earth
[17:35] that's where we draw this thought from
[17:37] the north pole the the north pole the
[17:39] south pole and they're polar opposites
[17:41] it's having different properties on
[17:43] different sides that's what this word uh
[17:45] polarization relates to
[17:47] uh so if something is polar it's the
[17:49] direct opposite in character or tendency
[17:52] as it relates to electricity or
[17:54] magnitude uh if something's magnetized
[17:56] you could have these polar opposites
[17:58] things that are directly opposite in
[18:00] character or tendency so what does that
[18:03] tell us if i'm talking about
[18:04] polarization you're talking about
[18:05] properties with different signs
[18:08] different characters
[18:10] and it's tr polarization can be good
[18:13] and we don't want to
[18:14] characterize it as all negative but it's
[18:16] something that can be good within a
[18:18] democratic society it's something that's
[18:20] good within the um
[18:22] the political process so it's not that
[18:23] it's all bad if you become polarized and
[18:26] believe in something and very adamant
[18:28] about something and people are different
[18:30] so it's not just the polarization alone
[18:32] that begins to raise these barriers to
[18:35] truth
[18:36] but polarization can quickly go beyond
[18:38] disagreement indifference
[18:41] to where wow you see it one way i see it
[18:42] another way and and so we can be
[18:44] different in character and i can
[18:46] acknowledge well i see it this way you
[18:48] see it that way and so and it can even
[18:50] be opposite
[18:52] where i think it's this way you think
[18:54] it's that way and it's really hard to
[18:55] see the two harmonized and that in
[18:57] itself is not wrong
[19:00] it's not wrong to have disagreement it's
[19:02] not wrong to not see things necessary
[19:04] exactly the same way but what happens
[19:06] when we go beyond just our differences
[19:09] is that can lead to a loss of empathy
[19:12] to where now because i believe a certain
[19:14] way and you believe another way
[19:16] there's certain mechanisms that begin to
[19:17] work within our in our minds
[19:20] and what happens is we begin to lose
[19:22] empathy over why this person may see it
[19:25] the way that they do or why i see it the
[19:27] way i do and the liberty that they may
[19:29] have to see it a different way and then
[19:31] we might feel attacked we might feel
[19:33] kind of defensive so we can't we're not
[19:35] just happy saying well we just agree to
[19:37] disagree
[19:38] you've got to tear the other person down
[19:41] or you've got to make the reason why
[19:42] they believe it differently because
[19:43] there's something wrong and there's some
[19:45] they've done this and they've done that
[19:47] and you start to tear something down and
[19:48] you lose empathy as to why they may be
[19:51] where they are and when that happens it
[19:53] goes beyond mere disagreement or
[19:55] differences
[19:57] and it leads to what is called effective
[19:59] polarization
[20:01] it's a negative sentiment towards one
[20:02] who differs or disagrees polarization is
[20:04] one thing and it would be fine
[20:06] we are polarized in a lot of our beliefs
[20:08] in a good way
[20:10] we believe the bible is the word of god
[20:11] that's polarizing we believe it's true
[20:14] it's without error that it we can trust
[20:16] it we can rely on we believe that jesus
[20:17] christ is the son of god that's
[20:18] polarizing there's a lot of things that
[20:20] are polarizing but what begins to happen
[20:22] is even holding those truths could you
[20:23] imagine that believing that jesus christ
[20:26] is the son of god who came into the
[20:27] world
[20:28] to shed his blood from my sins and it's
[20:30] the very heartbeat and blood of god that
[20:32] jesus loved those who disagreed with
[20:35] them and the very ones that crucified
[20:36] him he shed his blood for in what grace
[20:39] and mercy was shed and then as soon as
[20:41] we find somebody else who doesn't
[20:43] believe jesus christ the son of god you
[20:44] infidel i hope you die
[20:48] and like all of a sudden it's like whoa
[20:50] that escalated really quick
[20:52] we're bathed in the blood of jesus
[20:54] christ basking in the glow of his love
[20:56] and find out that someone doesn't share
[20:58] the same sentiments and we want to we
[21:00] want to do our own christian jihad on
[21:01] them
[21:03] it's a paradox isn't it maybe not quite
[21:05] a paradox but more uh
[21:07] revealing
[21:09] but this effect of polarization
[21:11] is where we begin to develop these
[21:13] negative attitudes these negative
[21:14] feelings towards someone who disagrees
[21:16] with us
[21:17] and this is where we begin to get very
[21:19] extreme our polarization is one thing
[21:20] but then we become begin to get
[21:22] extremist with it and it leads to this
[21:24] not just uh
[21:27] empathy but antipathy
[21:29] where now we are very harsh very
[21:32] critical
[21:33] not not that we just lost feeling but
[21:35] now we begin to develop these very
[21:36] negative feelings and it leads to
[21:38] radicalization
[21:39] where people get radical with it
[21:42] and whenever we become radicalized and
[21:45] i'm wanting to
[21:47] wanting to introduce these principles
[21:48] because i think that your mind you could
[21:50] grasp these things
[21:52] and use them in this context these are
[21:53] very foundational principles
[21:56] when we become radicalized it's easy to
[21:58] justify hatred
[22:01] when we become radicalized it's very
[22:04] easy to justify hostility
[22:06] and anger
[22:07] and bitterness
[22:09] and even
[22:10] violence
[22:12] well there's and you think well we're
[22:14] not we're not talking about christians
[22:15] anymore well i'm going to show a lot of
[22:17] grace for people who become radicalized
[22:20] and then do a lot of hateful spiteful
[22:23] sometimes not just
[22:24] character assassination but do
[22:26] physically physically do things
[22:29] that are out of character and they would
[22:31] know that they're out of character but
[22:33] they justify their hateful words they
[22:35] justify their hateful actions and they
[22:37] justify it out of some sort of
[22:38] radicalization about truth
[22:41] even some people when they become anti
[22:43] the word they become anti the message
[22:45] they become anti certain things it's
[22:47] it's not enough to continue to love and
[22:49] to pray and to desire to see grace come
[22:52] on the scene and things to change they
[22:53] become radicalized against something and
[22:55] once they become radicalized they'll use
[22:57] a lot of other people's failures and
[23:00] things that they've
[23:01] done and their own hurts and their own
[23:03] disappointments to justify hatred
[23:05] hostility and they'll even justify lying
[23:08] exaggeration manipulation and all sorts
[23:11] of nasty devious things and they'll
[23:13] justify it because they become
[23:15] radicalized against something
[23:17] and and they they will even be
[23:19] confronted with it and say well you know
[23:22] all of it was you know maybe 99 was a
[23:24] lie but one percent was true
[23:26] and the reason why they feel justified
[23:28] is because they're convinced that the
[23:29] means justify the ends justifies the
[23:34] means now there's also
[23:37] so there's there's a there's the camp
[23:39] that we could say that we need to be
[23:40] very careful of becoming radicalized
[23:42] where we're different we have
[23:44] differences well then that and that's in
[23:45] that way we're kind of polarized because
[23:47] we don't really see harmony or the way
[23:49] these two things
[23:50] uh could meet
[23:52] and then
[23:54] the the once it gets to this effect of
[23:56] polarization you get to get you begin to
[23:58] get nasty you're following me out or
[23:59] it's not we just disagree but now they
[24:01] disagree because they're the devil or
[24:03] you know maybe that's a
[24:05] i will people say that we know that's
[24:06] true but maybe we wouldn't say that
[24:08] about each other uh they have an iphone
[24:10] because they just can't afford an
[24:11] android whatever it is
[24:12] and so we get into these camps and we're
[24:15] in these kind of we take these positions
[24:18] and then when we become radicalized and
[24:20] we become very entrenched in these
[24:22] things and we get in that extremism it
[24:24] becomes more negative we're able to
[24:25] justify hostility and that's when we
[24:27] become radicalized
[24:29] now that's one side i just want to touch
[24:31] on this for just a brief moment because
[24:33] then there is also
[24:34] this radicalization myth
[24:37] and it'd be very very dangerous
[24:40] because then what we do
[24:42] and this is let's say we're not
[24:43] radicalized but then we can we can take
[24:46] this idea of being radicalized and we
[24:48] can use it to stigmatize those who have
[24:51] extreme beliefs
[24:53] where somebody's very fervent about
[24:54] something very passionate very zealous
[24:56] and maybe even extreme and because
[24:58] they're extreme we just give them this
[25:00] label this scarlet letter being
[25:01] radicalized
[25:03] and this happens it happens not i'm not
[25:05] this may not happen necessarily within
[25:06] the uh our circle of fellowship and the
[25:09] things that we believe within the
[25:10] message but to some extent i would say
[25:12] in broader christianity but definitely
[25:14] as christianity pits itself against
[25:17] other religions there's this label of
[25:19] radicalization that can be placed on
[25:21] certain things in order to create a
[25:22] climate of fear
[25:24] in order to kind of create this kind of
[25:26] self-censorship
[25:28] because you create this oh they're
[25:30] radicalized and
[25:31] and you you got to watch out because
[25:33] they're going to want to they're going
[25:34] to want to blow up your car they're
[25:35] going to want to do this they want to do
[25:36] that and it's all done to cause one to
[25:39] forsake
[25:40] their religious uh their religious
[25:43] beliefs
[25:45] to change their religious exercises
[25:49] that's why i believe that we ought to be
[25:51] very careful as christians
[25:53] the animus and the the bitterness that
[25:55] we be we could have or the disagreement
[25:57] that we could have towards other
[25:58] people's expression of what they believe
[26:01] because it can be a double-edged sword
[26:03] that if i'm just gonna be very blunt if
[26:04] you wanted to get all the mosque out of
[26:06] maricopa it's just a matter of time
[26:08] before they want to get all the churches
[26:10] out
[26:11] you thought about that
[26:13] and that there's a certain there's a
[26:14] certain way that we want to be able to
[26:15] worship christ in liberty we have the
[26:18] liberty to serve god we have the liberty
[26:20] to to dress the way we want and to
[26:22] preach the things that we want and then
[26:23] we want to use the law we want to use
[26:25] politics to shut the mouths of other
[26:27] people that don't see the message quite
[26:28] the same way we do or certain views the
[26:30] same way we do it can kick back
[26:33] it can backfire on you
[26:35] and so there can be this radicalization
[26:38] myth to where we we we say well they've
[26:41] been radicalized and we kind of use it
[26:43] to put this pressure on them so that
[26:44] they abandon the exercise of their
[26:47] conviction and we wouldn't want anyone
[26:49] to put that pressure on us
[26:51] because trust me there's those that
[26:52] would want to put this label on us and
[26:54] say you were just radicalized
[26:56] and you've drunk the kool-aid and you
[26:58] guys are in a cult and they want to cast
[27:00] you as being radicalized and they want
[27:02] to use that as some sort of intimidation
[27:04] it's just a matter of time until you
[27:05] guys go viral and then to put this
[27:08] pressure on us to abandon what our
[27:09] religious exercise
[27:12] and to abandon our i say religious
[27:14] exercise i'd use that very generally but
[27:16] i can say just abandon our discipline
[27:18] and our conviction in truth
[27:21] so you say well
[27:23] well what's your point brother aaron all
[27:24] right thank you for asking
[27:27] my my point is beware of the polls
[27:30] and i'm not talking about you know where
[27:31] they ask you questions and or or people
[27:33] from poland i'm saying beware of the
[27:35] polls
[27:36] the polarization the ex the the extremes
[27:39] the sides beware of those
[27:41] uh and beware of the extremism and the
[27:43] way they kind of push you within those
[27:45] extremes and be aware of your own biases
[27:48] be aware of certain ways that we might
[27:50] think we could be biased to certainly be
[27:52] aware of your own beliefs
[27:54] and this is the way i believe and this
[27:55] is why i believe it be very conscious of
[27:57] that and when someone believes
[27:58] differently realize that if you are in
[28:00] fact walking in truth by revelation and
[28:04] somebody is counter to that and they are
[28:07] uh they are in the opposite in character
[28:09] their opposite in tendency realize the
[28:11] grace that put you in the place that you
[28:13] are and how that it must be the same
[28:16] grace that'll put them likewise in the
[28:18] same place otherwise we're all just
[28:21] playing a game
[28:24] so you recognize i'm in truth by the
[28:26] grace of god they are the polar opposite
[28:28] to me but it's going to take the grace
[28:31] of god to change them and put them where
[28:33] i am and so as we spoke on for many many
[28:36] weeks on who is my neighbor we don't
[28:38] want to be that nasty neighbor who cast
[28:41] somebody down and always criticize them
[28:43] as and is terrible towards them because
[28:46] they're the opposite from us they're
[28:48] never wanna they're never gonna wanna be
[28:50] in the place you are
[28:52] and here you are in truth and you've
[28:55] created such a nasty energy around your
[28:57] truth that the person who's in complete
[29:00] deception knows enough that they don't
[29:02] want that
[29:05] so that's the
[29:06] uh that's my point in bringing up
[29:08] polarization beware kind of avoid the
[29:10] caustic extremism
[29:13] where you can get very extreme with
[29:15] something and when you get extreme you
[29:16] get very caustic with it and it's
[29:18] something that is uh
[29:20] that often grieves me as i can agree
[29:22] with somebody but their tone and their
[29:24] attitude and the way they're putting is
[29:25] so caustic
[29:27] and that's corrosive it's going to erode
[29:29] something and you're going to kind of
[29:31] lose
[29:32] the righteousness and it's become
[29:34] unrighteousness whenever it gets caustic
[29:37] so there's the kind of the subject of
[29:38] polarization but then also in another
[29:40] way of looking at this because i want to
[29:42] touch on hopefully we can get to it
[29:43] tonight on balance
[29:45] but i want to look at the idea of dogma
[29:48] and a dogma is a settled opinion it's a
[29:50] principle that one holds two
[29:52] that you hold to is being firmly
[29:54] established so you can have a dogma and
[29:56] he said this is this is firmly
[29:57] established in psalms 119 verse 89 it
[30:01] says forever o lord thy word is settled
[30:03] in heaven
[30:04] i use that so that when we introduce the
[30:06] concept of dogma use that term i don't
[30:09] want you to think that anything that's
[30:10] firmly established is you know be leery
[30:13] of god's word
[30:15] is dogma
[30:16] it's firmly established
[30:19] it's forever established it's the truth
[30:21] is firmly and forever established thy
[30:24] word is settled
[30:26] it is it is dogma the word of god is
[30:28] dogma so it's a
[30:29] principle that we can hold to the word
[30:31] of god is something we can hold to as
[30:33] being firmly established and as we
[30:36] talked about
[30:37] fanaticism before
[30:40] the line between faith and the word of
[30:42] god and fanaticism is found right here
[30:45] the word is the line between faith and
[30:47] fanaticism someone says well i have
[30:49] faith i'm zealous i have a zealous faith
[30:51] and then
[30:52] someone else has fanaticism you say well
[30:54] what's the difference brother the
[30:55] difference is the word
[30:57] because remember fanaticism exceeds
[30:59] something
[31:00] so the boundary that fanaticism exceeds
[31:02] is the boundary of the word of god where
[31:04] they take something that is outside the
[31:06] word it becomes the kind of the focal
[31:08] point the rallying point the rally and
[31:09] cry it's not even in the word it's not a
[31:12] subject of the word it's not addressed
[31:13] by the word or clarified by the word but
[31:15] yet it becomes something you can be very
[31:17] passionate very zealous of and then it
[31:19] becomes fanaticism because it's no
[31:21] longer in the foundation of the word so
[31:23] you want to know the difference between
[31:25] faith and fanaticism the word the line
[31:27] of the word the boundary of the word is
[31:28] the difference
[31:29] faith we know is built on the word
[31:32] faith can only be energized and fed by
[31:35] the word
[31:36] but fanaticism on the other hand it may
[31:38] be very near the word
[31:40] so you can have the word the word ends
[31:43] here
[31:43] and you can have fanaticism just right
[31:45] here right up next to it but it's
[31:47] crossed over
[31:48] so you have the word establishes the
[31:50] boundary fade fanaticism became very
[31:52] very near it but one thing about
[31:54] fanaticism is it's not fed by the word
[31:58] it's not supported by the word
[32:00] fanaticism lives outside of the word
[32:02] fanaticism has its existence outside the
[32:05] word because fanaticism is not actually
[32:06] sustained by the word
[32:08] now your your minds are working right
[32:10] now and i can tell there's things that
[32:11] are turned over and you realize that
[32:12] when someone has given themselves from
[32:14] faith into fanaticism it's no longer the
[32:17] word of god that is bolstering their
[32:19] enthusiasm it's no longer the word of
[32:21] god that's channeling their faith and
[32:23] causing them to act they're no longer
[32:24] operating by the message of the hour
[32:26] they're operating by all these other
[32:28] things
[32:29] forums and whatever else you want to
[32:31] talk whether it be social media or
[32:33] things you read and that's what becomes
[32:35] the evidence and the support and that's
[32:38] what keeps the belief or conviction
[32:40] going is things that aren't in the word
[32:43] come on somebody
[32:45] it's true it's something we have to be
[32:47] very very conscious of that fanaticism
[32:49] exists outside the word lives outside of
[32:52] the word and is fed and sustained by
[32:54] things that are not that are outside of
[32:55] the word
[32:57] and so it's important i believe it's
[32:59] important for us to know the difference
[33:00] between word and i'll use this phrase
[33:02] personal dogma
[33:05] very important for us to understand to
[33:06] know the difference between the word and
[33:08] personal dogma you can have a personal
[33:11] dogma
[33:12] as it relates to certain things and that
[33:15] that dogma
[33:17] as long as it's not anti-word and as
[33:19] long as it doesn't infringe on somebody
[33:20] else's liberty and christ then we could
[33:22] respect that right that's their personal
[33:24] conviction it's not a word but that's
[33:26] their personal conviction but it's
[33:28] important for us maybe to recognize that
[33:30] their conviction is not necessarily word
[33:32] based but if i'm the one with the
[33:33] personal dogma it'd be very important
[33:35] for me to realize that by me not
[33:38] drinking coffee
[33:43] i just lose everybody
[33:45] i'll drink i'm a social drinker i'll
[33:46] drink coffee every once in a while but i
[33:48] used to joke when somebody said brother
[33:50] aaron would you like some coffee and say
[33:51] no thanks i'm a christian
[33:53] and uh and then i really one time that
[33:55] kind of got taken the wrong way and like
[33:57] they didn't realize i was completely
[33:58] joking
[33:59] and so then i started saying uh no thank
[34:01] you i don't even smoke
[34:03] and i think that one was even worse so i
[34:05] just don't joke around anymore
[34:07] i'll say no thank you
[34:09] and so but if someone had this
[34:11] conviction that you shouldn't drink
[34:12] coffee that there's something wrong with
[34:14] coffee and i don't you shouldn't be
[34:16] drinking that kind of caffeine or maybe
[34:17] even meat don't eat meat meat is bad and
[34:20] they and they're vegan or vegetarian or
[34:22] pescatarian they only eat fish that
[34:23] would be a personal dogma
[34:26] that would be something that this is
[34:28] just the way somebody feels
[34:30] and and you would know they'd kind of be
[34:31] getting on a dangerous territory if they
[34:34] started to try to use this to support
[34:35] that
[34:36] right and that would be when it would be
[34:38] important for someone to say you know i
[34:39] have this i have this personal metric i
[34:42] have this personal conviction have this
[34:44] personal dogma and then that'll keep
[34:45] them from becoming what not just
[34:47] polarized but radicalized and looked
[34:49] down on all these filthy meat eaters
[34:54] and so it's important to know that and
[34:55] so i think it's kind of built into the
[34:57] word dogma in the sense that dogma would
[35:00] be a firmly established truth we could
[35:02] say that the word of god is dogma but in
[35:04] this sense god's word is not dogma dogma
[35:07] is a philosophical tenet or or a
[35:09] philosophical opinion
[35:11] think about that it actually comes from
[35:13] the root that which one thinks is true
[35:17] coming from the the root to seem good or
[35:20] to think
[35:21] you're pondering that that dogma is just
[35:24] something that which one thinks is true
[35:26] and it seems good or you think to be
[35:27] true so in that way dogma could be just
[35:29] a personal opinion we need to recognize
[35:32] when we are entering into these areas
[35:33] where we just hold a personal opinion
[35:36] and when opinion deviates from the word
[35:39] this is something i guess would be
[35:41] a
[35:42] very very uh broad subject but when
[35:45] whenever our opinion deviates from the
[35:48] word
[35:49] but you you want to justify it or some
[35:52] forces begin to work on you
[35:54] uh because of your personal conviction
[35:56] you try to make it spiritual if it's
[35:58] contrary to the word at some point i'll
[36:00] say this especially for a real believer
[36:02] there's gonna there's gonna be some
[36:03] dissonance
[36:04] begin to wrestle between well the word
[36:06] doesn't really talk about this at all
[36:08] but i have this idea this really gets
[36:10] under my crawl and i really feel strong
[36:12] but i can't really find any basis or
[36:13] justification for it so then you begin
[36:15] to get this little dissonance and in
[36:17] order to shout down the dissonance you
[36:19] become very dogmatic
[36:22] and so it becomes a dogma to you and
[36:24] then and that's where and then if
[36:26] someone tries to help you
[36:27] say hey you know by the way then you get
[36:29] what more entrenched
[36:31] because you get very defensive that's
[36:33] why we have to be very careful about the
[36:35] things that we begin to defend i found
[36:37] this in my own personal experience
[36:38] especially as a minister
[36:40] uh that there's things that truths that
[36:41] you would hold you'd say well i i i
[36:44] believe this is just right about where
[36:45] the word of god places this truth and
[36:47] all of a sudden you find somebody that
[36:48] just kind of takes it and throws it all
[36:50] the way over here and you're like oh my
[36:51] goodness how could you do that and in an
[36:54] effort you know to balance out the guy
[36:56] who wants to close the book and throw it
[36:57] all on the other side you want to take
[36:59] it and put it all the way over here
[37:02] and you find wait you realize wait a
[37:03] minute i don't even i don't even believe
[37:05] that
[37:06] i'm not that extreme i'm bending against
[37:08] this guy over here and you got to
[37:10] recognize when that begins to happen
[37:12] because sometimes one of the worst
[37:13] things that can take place in our own
[37:15] spirits is when we get oh we get
[37:17] unnecessarily defensive about truth
[37:21] and by pushing back against the air we
[37:23] kind of we cause ourselves to get a
[37:24] little bit out of off balance
[37:26] a little bit off balance
[37:28] and so that's how we can keep even from
[37:29] truth from becoming tainted with this
[37:32] personal dogma and opinion by just
[37:35] recognizing these mechanisms that can
[37:36] work against us and resisting
[37:39] being overly defensive resist uh this
[37:42] idea of shouting down our dissonance and
[37:44] becoming dogmatic on things if you have
[37:46] an opinion on something that the word
[37:47] doesn't clearly address keep it out of
[37:49] the realm of the word
[37:51] that way you won't try to use the word
[37:52] to justify it you won't become dogmatic
[37:54] about it and you can have grace for
[37:56] other people that may see it differently
[37:58] and and the church age book brother
[38:00] branham writes this it is very very
[38:02] profound i want to read a very large
[38:04] portion of it and i believe it just
[38:06] really conveys what um
[38:09] what i'm thinking about in terms of
[38:11] these
[38:12] where how it begins and it kind of
[38:14] entrenches itself
[38:15] and we know that he brings us through
[38:17] this progression of deed doctrine and
[38:19] death and how something can start as a
[38:21] deed it's merely a deed but then it
[38:22] becomes a doctrine and then it's crowned
[38:24] in death but this is just the one part
[38:26] here that deals with it from deed to
[38:28] doctrine
[38:29] see how it started out in the early
[38:31] church it was called deeds it's just
[38:32] something you do right
[38:35] i do this this is something i drink i i
[38:36] don't drink coffee or i drink coffee but
[38:38] he says then it became a doctrine
[38:41] it became the standard it became the
[38:44] unbending way it finally took over and
[38:47] god was pushed aside
[38:49] it's amazing that this could happen
[38:50] around things that are that are quotes
[38:52] and
[38:53] scriptures and principles in the word of
[38:54] god that you can because you may take a
[38:56] deed and it becomes a doctrine then god
[38:58] gets pushed out of it oh it started so
[39:00] small so quietly so inoffensively it
[39:03] looked so good
[39:05] it seemed so sound
[39:07] then it caught a hold and like a python
[39:09] it squeezed out the very breath and
[39:11] killed breath and killed all the
[39:13] spirituality there was in the church
[39:16] we need to be very careful that we don't
[39:17] have deeds that become doctrines
[39:20] that do not have god in them
[39:23] because they will act as a python in
[39:25] your spiritual
[39:26] life anybody want to say a personal amen
[39:29] to that you take up causes you get
[39:31] caught up in things that have don't have
[39:34] god in them and it's a deed the deed may
[39:36] be fine in itself hey i'm doing this
[39:38] thing i'm doing this thing but then it
[39:39] becomes this doctrine and it gets on
[39:41] this slippery slope where now it becomes
[39:42] more of an identification because more
[39:44] of a fervor more of a passion outside
[39:46] the realm of even recreation or hobby or
[39:48] even a conviction now it becomes this
[39:50] python that can squeeze the very
[39:52] spirituality out of you
[39:56] because it's gotten into it's gotten out
[39:58] of balance oh that false vine is subtle
[40:01] it is like an angel of light until it
[40:02] gets a hold on you
[40:04] now i want to say that i believe in
[40:05] leadership i wanted to read this because
[40:07] i felt it was so beautiful to balance
[40:08] out um
[40:10] some of the the way the channels through
[40:12] which deeds and doctrines come i believe
[40:15] in leadership but it's not the
[40:16] leadership of men i believe in
[40:18] i believe in the leadership of the holy
[40:19] ghost coming through the word
[40:22] there's a we could probably get the
[40:23] loudest course of amends everyone agree
[40:25] on that and then it gets a little tricky
[40:27] for some people because there's
[40:28] different camps i believe also that god
[40:30] has set men in the church men who are
[40:33] gifted by the spirit and they will keep
[40:35] the church in order i believe that i
[40:39] also believe that the church is ruled
[40:40] over by men that god sends to take
[40:43] charge
[40:44] we believe these things and i love this
[40:46] balance but that rule is by the word
[40:50] it's not the man's charisma it's not his
[40:52] opinion it's not his popularity it's not
[40:55] his politics it's not his money
[40:57] the leadership is by the world the rule
[40:59] is by the word so that it's not men
[41:01] really ruling but the spirit of god for
[41:03] the word and spirit are one now that's
[41:06] the anecdote to deeds becoming doctrine
[41:09] that's the anecdote from not being led
[41:11] astray into certain things that may be
[41:13] done and maybe personal conviction maybe
[41:15] personal opinion maybe personal dogma
[41:17] that someone does and then when it
[41:18] begins to take hold as a doctrine that
[41:21] happens when man's personality and his
[41:24] own preference and these different
[41:25] things begin to take the preeminence and
[41:27] then it's no longer ruling by the word
[41:29] you're ruling by your opinion and that
[41:32] opinion becomes the python
[41:34] that's going to take the spirituality
[41:35] right out of you
[41:38] so that men are no longer ruling by the
[41:40] spirit of god they're ruling by their
[41:41] own spirit their own opinions very very
[41:43] dangerous
[41:44] brother jason demars expressed it this
[41:46] way i believe it was last year
[41:48] at a ministers meeting in 2020 it seems
[41:51] like decades ago or maybe days ago i
[41:53] don't know anymore it's just kind of all
[41:54] running together
[41:56] but uh there's um
[41:58] he made the subject was on the line
[42:01] between being ecumenical and compromised
[42:03] it was very intriguing subject i really
[42:05] really enjoyed it i had the opportunity
[42:06] to speak on it myself but the one my
[42:08] takeaway was not what i spoke on but
[42:10] what brother jason dimar said and he
[42:12] talked about how
[42:13] where the problem
[42:15] in these areas and i want to
[42:16] specifically relate it to this
[42:18] the problem is when we are dogmatic
[42:21] when god allows differences
[42:24] and allow differences when god is
[42:25] dogmatic
[42:26] i thought ponder that for a moment so
[42:28] very well
[42:29] fray a framed statement
[42:32] that we can be very dogmatic on
[42:34] something
[42:35] that god's word doesn't even touch on
[42:39] could you imagine if we had this dogma
[42:42] that if somebody didn't have a turkey on
[42:44] thanksgiving they were serpent seed
[42:47] i mean i know some people that didn't
[42:49] and it just may be a very innocent way
[42:51] of putting it if someone didn't have
[42:53] turkey
[42:54] ate cheesesteaks or something like that
[42:56] on thanksgiving that they can't be
[42:58] christians right there's no way in the
[42:59] world they'd have to be from philly and
[43:02] can any good thing come from
[43:02] philadelphia i mean there's all the
[43:04] things we can start saying
[43:05] and that would be we all of a sudden get
[43:07] dogmatic and you just create kind of
[43:09] this i listen
[43:11] if things were uh if
[43:13] i if i would if i was just one percent
[43:16] good looking some people could take them
[43:17] like oh my goodness did you hear that we
[43:18] shouldn't have cheese steaks and just
[43:20] build a little cult around it but i have
[43:22] the benefit of not being very
[43:23] charismatic
[43:25] and that's how things get started just a
[43:26] little statement is made and also it
[43:28] becomes this idea and i'm using
[43:30] something very innocent because i doubt
[43:31] anybody had cheese steak on thanksgiving
[43:33] but if uh or maybe i'm doubting my
[43:35] doubts because i know someone did
[43:37] um so if they if we made that a doctrine
[43:41] and we're dogmatic about you have to
[43:42] have turkey you have to have turkey well
[43:44] please show me anywhere in the word of
[43:46] god and use josephus if you want all the
[43:49] the fox's book of martyrs you can use
[43:51] anything you want to try to find place
[43:53] where someone anywhere made this
[43:55] statement that you had to have turkey on
[43:56] thanksgiving
[43:58] and just show me anywhere and you'll
[43:59] find the god silent
[44:01] but you get dogmatic about it
[44:03] and there's a problem when we are
[44:05] dogmatic on something that god has not
[44:07] even addressed
[44:09] or dogmatic on things that god isn't
[44:11] very clear on he says it a certain way
[44:13] and and wow there's it could be this it
[44:15] could be that and you realize i i need
[44:18] to be very careful not to be dogmatic
[44:20] and say this is a firmly established
[44:22] truth these are the boundaries put a
[44:23] period on it and anybody outside of his
[44:25] contrary to the word of god when god
[44:26] himself hasn't done that
[44:29] and then the flip side is when we allow
[44:31] differences
[44:32] when god is dogmatic
[44:34] that the word of god says it's one way
[44:37] but we oh well it doesn't really matter
[44:39] it can be this way it can be that way
[44:41] when the word of god is clear the way
[44:42] that baptism ought to be and there's
[44:44] well maybe we can allow differences and
[44:47] the word of god is very clear on
[44:48] salvation very clear in certain things
[44:50] there's things in the word of god that
[44:51] god is dogmatic about this is an
[44:53] abomination this is how i feel this is
[44:55] the way it is this is how the things
[44:57] ought to be established this is the word
[44:58] of god pertaining you and we have things
[45:01] that the word is very dogmatic on and
[45:03] where we get in trouble is when we begin
[45:04] to allow differences
[45:06] on the things that god is dogmatic
[45:08] and what i find fascinating if i could
[45:10] use that word for this is a lot of times
[45:13] the people that are most dogmatic on
[45:15] things that god allows where god allows
[45:17] differences can allow for differences so
[45:19] easily where god is dogmatic
[45:22] it's like wow i mean you are very very
[45:24] extreme on this but very very loose on
[45:27] that with no basis for this but a lot of
[45:30] basis for this
[45:34] as brother rand continued i just had
[45:35] this statement written down and didn't
[45:36] provide the full quote he says with
[45:38] those arms of iron his deeds became
[45:41] doctrine and his doctrine became the law
[45:43] of an empire
[45:46] you see how subtle it can something can
[45:48] come into your life
[45:49] arms of iron can turn deeds into
[45:52] doctrine
[45:53] and then this doctrine becomes the law
[45:55] of your life
[45:58] this doctrine becomes what overrides you
[46:00] it controls you
[46:01] and so he's showing how that deeds
[46:03] become doctrine
[46:04] and they're not supported in the word
[46:06] but they're carnal traditions they're
[46:08] men's ideas they're things that christ
[46:09] even identified as
[46:12] taking away the life and the power of
[46:13] the word of god
[46:15] and so there's i just i i'm wanting just
[46:18] to introduce these things to you
[46:20] and and i realize with such liberty
[46:22] tonight it's been very easy to amplify
[46:23] these things maybe beyond what i
[46:24] intended
[46:26] but recognizing how personal dogmas and
[46:28] things and opinions that we might hold
[46:30] that might be different we have to be
[46:31] very careful that we don't become
[46:33] entrenched with them and extreme with
[46:35] them and i would say even dogmatic
[46:39] so that it becomes polarized and then it
[46:44] we begin to
[46:46] cause friction
[46:48] let me just say this avoid weaponizing
[46:50] your personal dogmas
[46:52] right you see something one way someone
[46:54] sees it the other way if two can come
[46:56] together and reason it out and find it
[46:57] in the word of god i believe that we
[46:58] should have relationships with one
[47:00] another that if i preach something wrong
[47:02] as your pastor and you see it in the
[47:04] word of god a different way you are
[47:06] absolutely welcome to come show me
[47:09] and i mean that
[47:11] if you feel differently for about
[47:12] something i am not above the word of god
[47:14] if you see it a certain way i welcome
[47:16] you to show me
[47:17] and we can talk about it and we can
[47:18] reason it out and then we might just say
[47:20] well brother you see it this way or well
[47:22] sister well argued and you see it that
[47:23] way and i can show you where i see it
[47:25] you can show me where you see it and
[47:26] then we could just say hey you know what
[47:28] i see where you're coming from you do
[47:30] you see where i'm coming from and there
[47:31] might be a way that these things kind of
[47:32] dovetail together when we look at things
[47:34] in the word of god but if there's
[47:36] something that's not in the word of god
[47:38] and you know it's your personal
[47:40] preference or your opinion and it's your
[47:42] own little pet doctrine or your pet
[47:43] dogma let's not weaponize it as for
[47:47] somebody else's detriment
[47:50] i mean there's things even such as one
[47:52] cup at uh a communion versus several
[47:54] little cups that divide denominations
[47:58] like we're all one big happy family
[47:59] let's have communion and wash one
[48:01] another's feet oh i love you brother
[48:02] washing one another's feet oh this is
[48:04] wonderful and then they bring out the
[48:05] communion train it's a bunch of little
[48:06] cups it's like never mind i hate you
[48:08] give me one cup
[48:10] and they separate
[48:12] and and you're laughing maybe because
[48:14] you know it's true or maybe you think
[48:16] i'm just joking but there's been
[48:17] organizations split over whether or not
[48:20] you use one cup or little cups at
[48:22] communion
[48:26] and i'm not saying there might not be a
[48:28] very robust theological debate with
[48:30] respect to that
[48:32] but it's very dangerous when you
[48:33] weaponize things
[48:35] and become radicalized and then
[48:37] therefore justify hatred
[48:39] because somebody sees it differently
[48:41] than you
[48:43] i need to go very quickly here it's in
[48:45] philippians chapter 4 verses four and
[48:47] five i debated on whether or not to
[48:49] include chapter verse four
[48:51] not a whole chapter just verse four
[48:52] chapter four verse four and then five
[48:54] but paul says rejoice in the lord alway
[48:57] and again i say rejoice this is very
[49:00] extreme it seems you're going to rejoice
[49:02] in the lord alway which really doesn't
[49:04] leave room for any more but then he says
[49:06] and again i say rejoice so rejoice all
[49:09] the time plus more
[49:11] and this seems to be very
[49:13] very passionate rejoice in the lord
[49:15] alway and again i say rejoice so rejoice
[49:18] 24 hours in a day and in another half
[49:20] hour or rejoice even more rejoice
[49:23] rejoice 365 and on the leap year right
[49:26] like rejoice rejoice rejoice but then he
[49:28] says
[49:29] let your moderation be known unto all
[49:30] men
[49:32] the lord is at hand what a remarkable
[49:34] statement let your moderation be known
[49:36] unto all men the lord is at hand
[49:38] moderation
[49:39] it speaks of yieldingness being able to
[49:41] yield let your moderation it speaks of
[49:44] reasonableness i know and it is true
[49:46] that this phrase could be used
[49:48] moderation can be used to express uh you
[49:51] know maybe not an excessive appetite or
[49:53] giving in to certain things
[49:55] but even in that way it holds this
[49:57] foundation this route of being
[49:59] reasonable
[50:02] that your moderation it's a it's it's
[50:05] being able to yield it's being able to
[50:06] understand it's being able to be
[50:08] entreated there's this kind of this
[50:10] accommodation without compromise that
[50:11] it's speaking of you're going to rejoice
[50:13] in the lord always but then we're not
[50:15] wanting to be these religious zealots
[50:17] who are extremists
[50:18] that want to kill all the infidels
[50:20] there's a moderation that we have
[50:22] in second corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[50:24] paul uses this he says now i paul i paul
[50:27] myself beseech you i'm reasoning with
[50:30] you i'm pleading you but he says by the
[50:31] meekness and gentleness of christ
[50:35] which means the the mildness makings the
[50:37] mildness the gentleness speaks of
[50:39] fairness one translation says by the
[50:41] meekness and the sweet reasonableness of
[50:44] christ
[50:46] christ had a there was a reasonableness
[50:48] about him we know that there was a no
[50:50] without question there was things that
[50:52] he acted under the anointing of the
[50:54] scripture the zealothine house hath eat
[50:57] me up and that zeal could in no way be
[50:59] fanaticism because it's according to
[51:01] prophecy the zeal of thy house hath
[51:03] eaten me up and he rid the the sanctuary
[51:05] or the the temple of the money changers
[51:07] and turned over their tables and this
[51:09] was him operating which would be some
[51:11] with some sort of zeal and passion but
[51:14] yet you look at how his life was
[51:15] characterized
[51:16] the friend of publicans and sinners and
[51:19] and he had tax collector that followed
[51:20] him and all these he had this this uh
[51:23] reasonableness about him that was
[51:25] inviting to those that needed him
[51:29] he wasn't prickly and caustic uh to the
[51:31] hurting to the lost he even uses the
[51:33] phrase you know those that aren't sick
[51:35] don't need a physician you guys that
[51:37] have it all figured out and are
[51:39] religious and you avoid this and you
[51:40] avoid that you know you could tithe on
[51:42] the mint and cumin and you everything
[51:44] broke down and you've got everything
[51:46] figured out you're religious and you're
[51:47] pious and you know how to pray and you
[51:49] cast down them oh god thank goodness i'm
[51:51] not like that guy over there he says i'm
[51:53] i haven't come for those who think
[51:55] they're perfectly healthy i've come for
[51:57] the sick
[51:59] and he had he had an inviting nature
[52:01] about him that drew the sick to him
[52:07] a reasonableness it comes from actually
[52:09] logicos which is of the word
[52:12] to be reasonable agrees to reason or
[52:14] following reason comes from a logic cost
[52:16] which which would come from logos
[52:19] and that's where i said jesus's
[52:20] reasonableness was an anti-word it never
[52:22] deviated from the word and that's our
[52:24] reason for believing is the word
[52:29] whereas fanaticism
[52:31] human reasoning takes place of the word
[52:34] remember radicalization is not connected
[52:36] to the word fanaticism is not connected
[52:38] to the word it can be very near it and
[52:39] at one point in it but then once it
[52:41] crosses the word it becomes
[52:44] fanaticism brother branham says in the
[52:46] message god in simplicity
[52:49] or god hiding himself in simplicity and
[52:51] revealing himself in the same he said
[52:52] there's one side that's highly
[52:53] intellectual cold and indifferent they
[52:56] deny everything there so that's one side
[52:58] and the others get on the other side on
[53:01] the other side a radical bunch of
[53:02] emotion and deny the word
[53:05] you see the two ruts
[53:07] two sides and one side that's all
[53:09] emotion cold or no emotion cold formal
[53:11] but they deny everything the other side
[53:13] maybe they don't deny as much but they
[53:15] deny the word and he said these are two
[53:16] sides but he says but the real true
[53:18] church stays right in the middle of the
[53:20] road
[53:22] that's when it comes to the word
[53:24] we know there are some things that we
[53:25] want to stay afar as far away from the
[53:27] edge as possible right right and we want
[53:30] to stay as far away from the world as
[53:31] possible there's other things that we
[53:33] find ourselves in and you've got this
[53:35] side and you've got that side and we
[53:36] need the discernment to know that i can
[53:38] stay right in the middle
[53:39] there's a path there's a right path do
[53:41] you believe that there's a right way and
[53:43] there's ditches that are formed on each
[53:45] side of the right way
[53:47] and in these ditches we can call them
[53:48] ruts but there's ruts on each side of
[53:50] the road
[53:51] and in these ruts there's hang-ups it's
[53:53] always easier to travel in the road is
[53:55] that at least something we can all agree
[53:56] on
[53:57] if you're in the ditch it's a lot harder
[53:59] to go
[54:00] but yet if you're in the motorcycle it's
[54:02] a lot easier to stay on the road instead
[54:03] of a ditch
[54:04] even if you're on your quad or a dirt
[54:07] bike you're going to find that the road
[54:08] is a lot easier uh to traverse than the
[54:11] ditches so you could be in a rut and
[54:13] moving along
[54:15] and i know this the phrase is i can't
[54:16] tell if i'm in a groove or a rut because
[54:19] they're really similar in a lot of ways
[54:21] but you could find these sides on both
[54:23] sides of the word of god in the
[54:24] imbalance are ditches
[54:27] and this is true the word can be
[54:29] preached in such a way
[54:32] to pull us out of those ruts
[54:36] but the danger's pulling too hard and
[54:38] you go from one ditch to the other
[54:41] oh they're all caught up in this they're
[54:43] all caught up in that and so in the
[54:45] effort to get them out of this you yank
[54:47] so hard they go out of one ditch into
[54:48] the other like oh my goodness i didn't
[54:50] you weren't supposed to do that
[54:52] why because you go too hard
[54:55] you can go so hard on you know god's
[54:57] prophets don't make mistakes where every
[54:58] word is thus the lord but you've got to
[55:00] be very careful when you start to talk
[55:01] about mistakes otherwise you just can
[55:03] reject the whole thing
[55:05] there's ditches that form themselves on
[55:07] each side of the road when it comes to
[55:09] god's path that he has for us and we
[55:10] have to be sure that we stay out of the
[55:12] ditch
[55:14] that the real true church stays right in
[55:16] the middle of the road in other words
[55:18] it's important for us to be balanced
[55:19] christians
[55:21] even the idea of planting seed you you
[55:23] plant in the in a row because that's
[55:25] something that's going to enhance the
[55:26] yield and maximize your yield
[55:29] why don't we just throw seed out there
[55:31] indiscriminately any any farmers here
[55:33] what do you do you ho a row you farm in
[55:35] a row and you plant in a row why to
[55:37] maximize the effectiveness of the seed
[55:40] to maximize the yield of the seed if you
[55:42] just throw it all out there
[55:43] indiscriminately and nothing's in its
[55:44] place in the proper channel you won't
[55:46] get the results you need and you can
[55:48] maybe make some progress in a ditch but
[55:50] it's not going to be efficient
[55:53] and expedient to where we need to go get
[55:55] out of the ditches in the middle of the
[55:57] road and avoid those ruts that are
[55:59] hang-ups that cause it so hard to go the
[56:02] way of the christian life i believe i
[56:04] could say this in the name of the lord
[56:05] some of us are finding the word of god
[56:07] to be very difficult not because of the
[56:10] word but because of the personal dogmas
[56:12] we've attached to it and we're finding
[56:14] so much resistance and we're finding it
[56:16] so hard to move forward and you're just
[56:18] in a ditch
[56:20] just get out of the ditch leave the
[56:22] personal dogma alone leave all their
[56:23] stuff get out of the ditch get in the
[56:25] middle of the road you'll find you know
[56:26] what it's much easier when i stay
[56:28] in the middle of the road
[56:33] billy branham and when he's preaching
[56:35] revelation of jesus christ he's uh in
[56:37] december of 1960 he's talking about how
[56:40] there was this legalism that came
[56:42] legalist teaching and he said the
[56:44] legalist teaching was a good thing
[56:46] because all he had got what had gone was
[56:48] calvinistic in england where they didn't
[56:50] even have revivals anymore and john
[56:52] wesley came along preaching the armenian
[56:54] doctrine which balanced it up so he's
[56:55] saying that they were all on this one
[56:57] side in calvinism and then there was
[56:58] armenianism and he says god will always
[57:01] balance it up
[57:03] and so sometimes the
[57:05] there can be an extreme that is god's
[57:07] purpose of trying to bring the balance
[57:09] but what do you have to do you don't
[57:10] want to get in this side or that side
[57:12] you got to find where god's trying to
[57:13] bring the balance
[57:14] i've often wondered this sometimes this
[57:16] is where the danger is uh when we have
[57:18] access to
[57:19] all the other great ministries that are
[57:21] in the world today and you can stream
[57:23] this preacher and that preacher and this
[57:24] minister and this pastor and just right
[57:26] now we can leave the service and we can
[57:28] pick up somebody else's service and we
[57:29] can listen to what they preach tonight
[57:31] and it's very wonderful to have maybe an
[57:33] opportunity to hear what some of these
[57:34] other uh ministers are saying but
[57:36] there's a real danger
[57:37] because i know it could happen at any
[57:39] moment to our services where somebody
[57:41] just tunes in at one moment and like wow
[57:45] they're really out on a limb
[57:48] because you've never you've never
[57:50] watched the pastor climb up the tree
[57:52] set the stage for why he's going out on
[57:54] a limb to rescue a lamb that's gone a
[57:56] little bit of stray to bring him back
[57:58] off the limb and get him back on the
[58:00] down the tree like we don't catch the
[58:02] rest of it so we go away going man i
[58:04] really wish brother ann was on a limb i
[58:05] really wish he was this way i really
[58:06] wish he did that and you don't know you
[58:08] don't even know where it's going right
[58:10] because you only catch a glimpse
[58:12] and it's important for us to realize
[58:14] that sometimes god will allow things to
[58:16] happen to bring a balance but you got to
[58:18] take everything in total
[58:19] and allow god to balance it up
[58:24] i want to end with this
[58:25] with a thought
[58:27] just i want to sum this up
[58:30] polarization
[58:32] and let me say it more this way
[58:33] extremism and even
[58:35] radicalization
[58:37] and i want to make this even in this
[58:38] sense even things that are anti-word
[58:42] are sometimes born as a counterculture
[58:45] and counterculture is something that
[58:48] where there's something is a certain way
[58:50] and then that's kind of what the hippies
[58:52] were right there's counter culture
[58:54] there's different things that you know
[58:55] they want to be counter it's like all
[58:58] the hipsters
[58:59] you know they want they just want to be
[59:01] different and they've just all become
[59:02] the same
[59:03] and it's like you're not really a
[59:04] hipster you're like everybody else your
[59:06] beard your flannel your boots everything
[59:08] you're just a carbon copy of the next
[59:10] guy
[59:11] and and so there's it's this attempt to
[59:13] kind of try to be different edgy counter
[59:15] culture
[59:16] and so there's this i'm not looking at
[59:17] the sense of some sort of you know uh
[59:20] movement that wants to be counter
[59:21] culture
[59:22] in itself but there's this things that
[59:24] can take place to where there's certain
[59:26] things are a certain way but then
[59:28] something raises up to counteract that
[59:30] and to be against it and there's a lot
[59:32] of things that are movements and
[59:34] extremes and political ideals and
[59:37] philosophies that exist for a reason
[59:41] and maybe we don't ask ourselves why is
[59:43] it this way
[59:44] there's a sermon that i had wanted to
[59:46] preach for a long time and i recently
[59:47] just revisited my notes on it and hadn't
[59:49] recently
[59:50] there's times we find ourselves i won't
[59:52] preach it right now it's 8 35
[59:54] but there's times we find ourselves
[59:56] having to make a critical decision
[59:58] and instead of asking ourselves
[1:00:01] what decisions should i make we should
[1:00:02] ask ourselves
[1:00:04] how did i get here
[1:00:07] and there's a reason why people can be
[1:00:09] where they are there's a reason why
[1:00:10] they're there and it's not to say that
[1:00:11] they're justified in being there but
[1:00:13] maybe to find out how someone gets there
[1:00:15] is explanatory as to why they're feeling
[1:00:17] the way that they are
[1:00:18] and there's instances where someone
[1:00:20] could be
[1:00:21] uh
[1:00:22] could perceive a problem
[1:00:25] and even if it's not fully rational
[1:00:28] they their their position exists for a
[1:00:31] reason even if it's not really a true
[1:00:33] solution to the problem or fully
[1:00:34] rational but it exists because they
[1:00:36] recognize something is wrong they
[1:00:38] perceive a problem
[1:00:40] and many polarizing movements are in
[1:00:42] direct opposition against the word
[1:00:45] this is important for us to ponder at
[1:00:47] all times how does this relate to the
[1:00:49] word of god modern events are made clear
[1:00:51] by prophecy i always want to view things
[1:00:52] through the the viewer the viewfinder of
[1:00:54] god's word i want to look at it through
[1:00:55] the word of god and there's a lot of
[1:00:57] things that exist because they're kind
[1:00:58] of it's satan's agenda against the word
[1:01:01] of god and you go oh wow this is
[1:01:02] happening because it's against it's
[1:01:04] anti-word it i can see that this is
[1:01:06] clearly against the word
[1:01:08] but i i know it's late but please i
[1:01:10] think the lord just arranged it
[1:01:11] perfectly with those who have late
[1:01:13] bedtimes or no work tomorrow or
[1:01:14] something like that are here tonight i'm
[1:01:16] not going to be very much longer but i
[1:01:17] want to share this it's very important
[1:01:18] it's very heavy up on my heart
[1:01:20] but so there's things that are anti-word
[1:01:23] and sometimes it's not obvious
[1:01:25] but god's got to bring us to these
[1:01:26] places to recognize anything that's
[1:01:28] contrary to the word of god we need that
[1:01:29] discernment but i want to say this in
[1:01:31] some cases there can be movements or
[1:01:33] even extremes that exist
[1:01:35] because of the lack of broad faith in
[1:01:37] the word of god
[1:01:39] now
[1:01:41] i hope i hope that that statement is
[1:01:43] explanatory but let me say it this way
[1:01:46] in our even in america alone there's
[1:01:48] problems that exist because faith has
[1:01:52] lost its hold
[1:01:53] within our community community at large
[1:01:56] when you when you don't have men of
[1:01:58] conviction when you don't have principle
[1:02:00] when you don't have integrity in truth
[1:02:02] and the bible begin to lose its premise
[1:02:04] there's things that exist as problems
[1:02:06] today
[1:02:08] in america and around the world that are
[1:02:10] symptoms of broad faith a public
[1:02:13] believing in god a a broader public
[1:02:15] going to church a broad right of public
[1:02:17] believing in christ in the virtues of
[1:02:18] the word of god and in a broad faith in
[1:02:20] the word of god as that has weakened
[1:02:22] it's given rise to these other things
[1:02:25] so i i want you to recognize things that
[1:02:27] may seem to be very anti-word sometimes
[1:02:30] they exist not to be against the word
[1:02:33] but they exist in the absence of the
[1:02:35] true word
[1:02:37] all right to me it's so liberating when
[1:02:39] you think about it that way it was
[1:02:40] something that really and i'm really
[1:02:42] continuing on the subject of blind trust
[1:02:44] bad faith
[1:02:45] because this was something so i
[1:02:47] recognized how we we lose our our center
[1:02:49] post we lose our absolute when we when
[1:02:51] we don't recognize that some things
[1:02:53] exist today because faith no longer has
[1:02:55] its hold in society as it once did
[1:02:59] so let's just as i close think about the
[1:03:00] first christmas
[1:03:02] i want to use this
[1:03:04] to
[1:03:05] to wrap this
[1:03:07] to wrap this up
[1:03:09] but in the first christmas the world was
[1:03:10] lost
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:14] groping in darkness it was chaotic it
[1:03:16] was depraved
[1:03:18] you'd actually find if you study it that
[1:03:19] had been hundreds of years
[1:03:21] since the word of god had been spoken
[1:03:24] they had lost so much
[1:03:26] of their
[1:03:27] of their worship
[1:03:29] even in israel
[1:03:34] there is so much in the word of god
[1:03:37] is somebody praying that i just stopped
[1:03:39] because now my throat is dry
[1:03:44] the world
[1:03:45] the um it was there there's so many
[1:03:47] things that's kind of maybe just getting
[1:03:48] into my thought process here because i
[1:03:50] studied on this
[1:03:51] and i know exactly what i'm looking at
[1:03:52] and i don't want to have to describe the
[1:03:54] whole picture to you but even israel
[1:03:56] god's chosen people the nation of israel
[1:04:00] had no word
[1:04:02] the word of god had been lost
[1:04:04] and so even if you go to luke chapter 2
[1:04:07] i'm not going to read it in luke chapter
[1:04:08] 2
[1:04:09] it sets the scene for the birth of
[1:04:10] christ because caesar augustus
[1:04:13] called for taxation what does that tell
[1:04:16] us they are under the dominion and rule
[1:04:18] of a foreign power
[1:04:20] they've been stripped of their liberties
[1:04:21] they're being called to tax and to
[1:04:23] report back to their the place of their
[1:04:25] birth and their their family lineage
[1:04:27] in order to report and so it's in that
[1:04:29] season the darkest of times
[1:04:32] god's answer and god's solution to all
[1:04:34] these things that we could describe
[1:04:36] was jesus christ
[1:04:38] this was god's answer what we read about
[1:04:40] luke chapter 2 tonight this babe lying
[1:04:41] in a major this was the beginning of
[1:04:43] god's answer
[1:04:45] the savior of the world now follow me
[1:04:46] please very closely very closely here
[1:04:49] so christ
[1:04:51] then
[1:04:52] was the answer to all strife
[1:04:55] christ was the answer to all evil
[1:04:58] he was the answer to sorrow he was the
[1:05:00] answer to sickness he was the answer uh
[1:05:02] uh to to uh whatever you could think of
[1:05:06] cry that would be negative jealousy
[1:05:08] hatred
[1:05:10] bitterness
[1:05:12] anxiety depression christ was the answer
[1:05:15] and we could say even today would we not
[1:05:17] agree that if there is a lacking if
[1:05:19] there is a longing christ is the
[1:05:20] absolute answer to any need that we have
[1:05:23] do we believe that
[1:05:26] so then that was god's answer in the
[1:05:27] first christmas
[1:05:29] then what happens if christ is not
[1:05:31] preached
[1:05:34] what happens if christ isn't lifted up
[1:05:37] i i'm wanting to i pray
[1:05:39] that your heart could be softened
[1:05:41] towards those that are lost
[1:05:44] because what happens when christ is no
[1:05:47] longer lifted up
[1:05:48] what happens if christ is not preached
[1:05:52] in the absence of a christ to run to
[1:05:56] they'll turn to something else
[1:05:59] and in revelations chapter 3 verse 20
[1:06:01] says behold i stand at the door and
[1:06:02] knock one of the most pitiful scriptures
[1:06:05] in the bible because christ's true
[1:06:08] nature is no longer in the church
[1:06:11] he's no longer within the church he's no
[1:06:13] longer in the place that is identified
[1:06:15] as christians as maha gandhi said it is
[1:06:17] not the christ that i do not like it is
[1:06:19] the christians that i don't like
[1:06:22] he said he liked christ he said it's the
[1:06:24] christians i don't like why because the
[1:06:27] christ that ought to make the christian
[1:06:28] church a christian church is no longer
[1:06:31] in the church so it's not really a
[1:06:32] christian church it's just a church
[1:06:36] it's a mystery babylon and it becoming
[1:06:39] it becoming this
[1:06:40] and it becoming a church that no longer
[1:06:42] has christ christ true reasonableness
[1:06:45] christ's true nature is no longer in the
[1:06:47] church
[1:06:48] and if jesus christ no longer has the
[1:06:50] preeminence what does the church have to
[1:06:53] offer except personal dogma opinion
[1:06:56] polarization
[1:06:58] if christ no longer has preeminence what
[1:07:00] is the church inviting people to
[1:07:03] and listen there's people that are sharp
[1:07:05] enough to look at it and say that's not
[1:07:07] something i want
[1:07:09] that's no better than the other
[1:07:10] religions of the world that's just as
[1:07:12] bankrupt as this theology that's just as
[1:07:14] bankrupt as that one and what they do is
[1:07:16] they turn to something else not because
[1:07:19] they're evil but because of their need
[1:07:21] is not met in the church
[1:07:25] can i blow your mind since you waited
[1:07:26] with me this long we can really really
[1:07:29] have a lot of hatred and bitterness
[1:07:31] towards feminism but i don't because i
[1:07:33] had the highest grade in feminist
[1:07:35] political theory when i graduated from
[1:07:36] my undergrad degree i had the highest
[1:07:38] grade in the class the feminist hated me
[1:07:41] but i didn't hate them
[1:07:46] feminism offers
[1:07:48] to women who've been marginalized
[1:07:50] women who've been abused women who've
[1:07:52] been controlled
[1:07:53] it offers to those women the value and
[1:07:57] the worth that christ could give them
[1:08:01] think very deeply about this because we
[1:08:02] make a lot of people are bitter enemies
[1:08:04] but what they what they found in their
[1:08:06] ideology
[1:08:08] is what christ could have offered them
[1:08:10] if the church hadn't kicked them out
[1:08:14] and so you're the only one that holds
[1:08:16] the true balm
[1:08:19] to give them what they need and they're
[1:08:21] looking to find in their ideologies
[1:08:25] let me say this way the ism itself can
[1:08:27] be evil
[1:08:29] but the ist
[1:08:31] may just be confused
[1:08:34] the ism may be evil the ism may be
[1:08:36] anti-word but the ist the one that's in
[1:08:38] it may just be hurting may just be
[1:08:40] seeking the feminism is anti-word but
[1:08:43] the feminist just may be looking for
[1:08:45] something that'll give her the value and
[1:08:47] give her the worth that only christ can
[1:08:49] give her but she never found it in the
[1:08:51] church
[1:08:59] all right
[1:09:01] i'm gonna stop here
[1:09:02] if we could stand together i'm gonna
[1:09:04] sort of turn the service over brother
[1:09:06] michael if you don't mind coming and
[1:09:07] maybe playing
[1:09:11] but i'm going to turn it over to brother
[1:09:13] loyal for worship
[1:09:14] and uh
[1:09:16] but i i want to i'll say this just so no
[1:09:18] one
[1:09:20] can get worried about where i'm going
[1:09:21] because i realize even right now i've
[1:09:23] probably set a pretty good foundation
[1:09:25] to either say
[1:09:26] if you celebrate christmas you're going
[1:09:28] to hell or if you don't celebrate
[1:09:29] christmas you won't be in the millennium
[1:09:31] i've probably set a pretty good
[1:09:32] foundation for either one of those but
[1:09:33] let me just say this when it comes to
[1:09:34] celebrating christmas it's december 1st
[1:09:37] some of you have already gotten out your
[1:09:38] christmas decorations
[1:09:40] uh or some of you have already gotten
[1:09:41] out your ba humbug sign i don't know but
[1:09:44] let me just say this when it comes to
[1:09:45] celebrating christmas that's a family
[1:09:47] decision
[1:09:49] not a church decision
[1:09:51] there's not there's no church creed
[1:09:53] that's going to force you to do one
[1:09:54] thing or the other
[1:09:56] i think that's something that
[1:09:59] there should be no church pressure when
[1:10:00] it comes to those things
[1:10:02] if if i as the pastor in my family
[1:10:04] celebrated christmas and none of you did
[1:10:07] there should be no pressure for you guys
[1:10:08] to change
[1:10:11] what you do as family when it comes to
[1:10:12] christmas
[1:10:14] if i didn't celebrate christmas as a as
[1:10:16] your pastor and i was very adamant
[1:10:18] within my own home that we do it this
[1:10:19] way and we don't do it that way and
[1:10:21] we've seen the nonsense and we're going
[1:10:22] to be very careful not to identify
[1:10:23] ourselves with all the frivolity that's
[1:10:25] related to christmas then i wouldn't it
[1:10:27] wouldn't be my place and i probably may
[1:10:28] be giving a very uh open door into how i
[1:10:31] believe that the message of the hour
[1:10:33] lays this out i should not exert
[1:10:35] pressure from the pulpit
[1:10:38] and put this political pressure on you
[1:10:39] to change what you feel led to do within
[1:10:41] your home
[1:10:43] but what we can do is use the word of
[1:10:45] god to bring the balance
[1:10:47] and use the word of god to let christ
[1:10:48] have his preeminence within our homes
[1:10:51] and there may be things that you could
[1:10:52] do as families there may be something we
[1:10:54] do as a youth group there might be
[1:10:55] things that we do that should not be
[1:10:56] taken as some sort of endorsement or
[1:10:58] approval of anything because as a church
[1:11:00] i would say this you abide by your
[1:11:03] convictions as you see them in the word
[1:11:04] of god you abide them as you feel that
[1:11:06] you ought to in the home but most of all
[1:11:10] let's not leave
[1:11:12] the word of god
[1:11:14] because it's when we do that
[1:11:16] all of a sudden things become polarized
[1:11:19] and we have to have an a service and a b
[1:11:21] service
[1:11:23] so those who want don't mind me saying
[1:11:25] merry christmas can come in the morning
[1:11:26] and those who can't stand it come in the
[1:11:28] evening
[1:11:29] right
[1:11:30] there's there's a there's a church i
[1:11:31] know of that
[1:11:33] had different entrances and exits so if
[1:11:35] you could enter one way you could exit
[1:11:37] the same way
[1:11:38] and that church
[1:11:40] they no longer hold services in this
[1:11:41] building anymore but that church
[1:11:43] actually the people entered and left
[1:11:46] according to the particular doctrine
[1:11:48] that they believed
[1:11:50] you came through that door you were in a
[1:11:52] camp if you left through that door you
[1:11:53] are still in that camp
[1:11:56] and let it not be so amongst us that we
[1:11:57] become so polarized in the things that
[1:11:59] god is not dogmatic on do we begin to
[1:12:01] lose the fellowship and the strength and
[1:12:03] the camaraderie that we can have
[1:12:05] amongst ourselves
[1:12:07] because god's doing something very
[1:12:08] special
[1:12:10] this is the work of god that is very
[1:12:11] very special
[1:12:13] it's done so much for me i can testify
[1:12:15] as a christian this work of god has done
[1:12:17] so much for me i trust that you could
[1:12:18] testify the same for you and your
[1:12:20] families
[1:12:21] and i have a burden this this december
[1:12:24] to lift up christ
[1:12:26] and do it in a way
[1:12:28] that promotes the freedom
[1:12:30] of worship and the liberty of the holy
[1:12:32] spirit in our midst can we do that
[1:12:34] together
[1:12:35] let's pray our gracious heavenly father
[1:12:37] lord has a precious presence with us
[1:12:39] tonight
[1:12:41] it's wonderful how you orchestrate just
[1:12:43] the
[1:12:44] the service from beginning to end
[1:12:47] and lord our heart
[1:12:48] misses
[1:12:49] the
[1:12:50] more than a dozen families that are not
[1:12:52] here this evening we we miss them
[1:12:55] we miss their prayers and their singing
[1:12:57] and
[1:12:58] this their countenance their amends it's
[1:13:00] obvious lord that
[1:13:01] that they're not with us and we miss
[1:13:02] them and to think lord that in their
[1:13:05] absence in such an extreme absence you
[1:13:07] still brought so many out to the house
[1:13:09] of god and the house
[1:13:11] feels it doesn't feel empty it feels
[1:13:12] full and there's such an anticipation
[1:13:14] and a worship where the voices being
[1:13:17] raised it created just the perfect
[1:13:19] atmosphere tonight
[1:13:20] to hear your voice
[1:13:23] and lord i realize as i have the benefit
[1:13:26] of looking at a month's worth of sermons
[1:13:28] and a burden
[1:13:29] that i would like to unfold to this
[1:13:31] church as you've burdened me
[1:13:33] it might be easy for some to take the
[1:13:35] things that i've said
[1:13:37] and feel that i'm pushing pushing on
[1:13:39] them
[1:13:41] but lord let me just get out of the
[1:13:42] picture tonight
[1:13:44] and may you just be the one that sets
[1:13:46] their present within their hearts
[1:13:49] to either encourage and increase our
[1:13:51] zeal or wash us of any fanaticism that
[1:13:53] keeps us from seeing your face clearly
[1:13:57] our need is for you
[1:14:00] our answers are in your word
[1:14:02] [Music]
[1:14:03] and lord as we brought to our minds the
[1:14:06] image of a feminist
[1:14:09] who can be very
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:12] passionate of certain ideals and
[1:14:14] principles
[1:14:16] and in that belief and conviction that
[1:14:18] can be so anti-word
[1:14:20] lord to understand
[1:14:24] that even that movement
[1:14:26] and those positions as anti-word as they
[1:14:29] are some people are caught up in them
[1:14:31] because when the church ought to have
[1:14:33] nurtured her
[1:14:35] protected her
[1:14:36] and valued her
[1:14:40] she was marginalized and abused and cast
[1:14:43] down
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:45] and is just searching for something to
[1:14:46] find the worth that is in her
[1:14:50] lord that's what happened to your bride
[1:14:54] in the face of so many isms
[1:14:57] she became an ist
[1:14:59] not because she wanted to be
[1:15:02] but because she couldn't find you
[1:15:05] and i'm so glad we found the ist the
[1:15:08] christ
[1:15:10] that you've taken us to become
[1:15:12] christians
[1:15:14] and i pray tonight as we stand in your
[1:15:16] presence that you could be the one that
[1:15:18] levels this out in this subject matter
[1:15:20] and the things that i'm preaching that
[1:15:21] we could find the true balance and be in
[1:15:23] harmony with your word in these things i
[1:15:25] commit it to you now i pray father
[1:15:27] be with your people and bless them
[1:15:29] supremely
[1:15:30] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:15:32] pray
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:35] god bless you
