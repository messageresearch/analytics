honoring your word lord we have gathered in your name therefore we believe by faith you are in our midst the lord we desire that the word would have preeminence aside from facilities aside from dynamics of uh furniture in the room and the location lord we just desired that you would be the dynamics that you would be the one that would come and speak to our hearts and give us the things that we have necessary for this journey that we're on and lord we realize looking around that maybe these are unique settings and unique circumstances maybe even some would say a unique gathering of people the lord we believe that we have been drawn by your voice that we have come with the hunger in our hearts to feed upon the unfailing body word of the son of man so we give that the right place today we pray that you would touch hearts that are hurting lord if there be any sick amongst us may they be healed father if there be a lost one may they hear your voice and come to you pleading lord the

of the lord jesus christ amen amen we welcome everyone here today we welcome no visitors because all of us have been here just about the same time as anybody else so we're just family here today and we're glad to see each one of you that's come out there's many that traveled to be here from a long ways that have uh meant a lot to us in our lives through the years and it's nice to see them here uh to be here for this service that we have today and we welcome you there's not a lot to say other than we just we love the lord we believe that he's with his people and it's a great privilege to be able to gather together today around the words if you could just turn in your bibles to genesis chapter one we appreciate the musicians stepping in genesis chapter 1 we're going to read verses 1 to 5. there's perhaps a lot in my heart personally i'd like to share with you uh but we it's evident that god has called us here and we feel led just to to begin a work that would rally around the word of the lord and the lord would just add those that he would see fit so we just thank you showing your support today and being here but i really desire just that the word would have preeminence and so we're just going to turn directly to the word in genesis chapter 1 verses 1 to 5 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day amen you may be seated we had we had held the service back at the end of july and we had ministered on the subject in the beginning and lord's impressed this subject on my heart to continue in and i'd like to maybe just recap just a few things that we had looked at the last time and go further in this subject but we're drawing it from genesis chapter 1 verse 1 where it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and it starts with that phrase of beresheth in the beginning it's a time when something begins and the way that i've been looking at it is the time when god begins to tell a story and he's telling the story of himself he's telling a story of redemption and god has to start somewhere to begin to express something and god be an eternal one without beginning or without end he had to start something in order to tell his story or to express himself it says in the beginning god that's elohim l which is strong one and allah which means bound by an oath or to swear and so it's elohim the strong one bound by an oath and it paints the picture that this is the covenant god this is not just a deity this is not the figment of someone's imagination this isn't just somebody conjuring up an image that they would worship but this is the eternal one a strong one who's bound by an oath it comes from the word to swear and so it's the covenant god a god who's made a promise and he had something that he wanted to express and so god from the very moment that he begins to create he's expressing something but he's actually hiding the ultimate expression in his creation and it's then in genesis chapter 2 it's not just elohim but it's lord god jehovah elohim and jehovah speaks of the self-existent one it comes from adana here which comes from the word havah which means to become so it's jehovah elohim he's the becoming god he's one that exists or become becomes known so he was eternal but because no one else was he wasn't known he was only known to himself but his nature was jehovah god as he began to be create he was no longer just elohim now he's jehovah elohim because he's the becoming god a god that wants to unveil himself or be made known and in ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11 he says he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end so he has set something in the heart of man and the image that's created when he says this that he has he's made everything beautiful in his time but he set the world in their heart so that no man can figure out what he's doing from the beginning to the end but it's something that you can only grasp from an eternal perspective he's hid it in the heart to where only by his quickening only by his revealing can you really understand the work of god from the beginning to the end and what i want to emphasize today is that he has hidden a meaning in his creation that as he creates he's showing something he's portraying something he's hiding something and he gives us a window into his heart or into his mind to catch he can by revelation and we look at creation by revelation we can begin to catch oh this is what god is doing and we realize that where we sit now we have the benefit if we say hindsight's 20 20. and with the way 2020 is unfolded 2020 vision doesn't sound good anymore some of us would pay a lot of money to have 20 20 vision but now we're like oh 2020 is a just causes us to flinch a little bit but in looking back and we often have the phrase hindsight is 20 20. it means looking back you see things better you see things more clearly so we do have the benefit of looking back and seeing what god is doing and have an understanding and the scripture says in romans chapter 15 verse 4 for whatsoever things are written aforetime were written for our learning now we we have to take this very very personal for ourselves today that the things that were written in the bible and even the testimony of the saints to the new testament church and through the church ages have been recorded for our learning it's there for our benefit and so we can look back and see everything that god has achieved from the moment that he began to create to the time where we are now and we know it's for a specific purpose and god has a specific goal but these things that are written in the scripture are written afore time for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope and as i pondered that this past week these things are written for our learning and that through the patience and comfort of the very things that were written we might have hope so as i pondered i thought what does god want us to learn from in the beginning that if we're to learn from scripture and we've been taught that you have to see jesus christ in every scripture and the bible's saying that the scriptures were written for our patience and our comfort that we might learn from them written for our learning that we might have hope so what is it that god wants us to learn from genesis chapter one verse one what in this would actually begin to give us hope as we read this and as we look at it we think in the beginning genesis 1 1 we'll just read kind of through a little bit our text here in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth so we we have this understand this is the eternal one this is a perfect one there's no darkness in him there's no shadow of turning and and god creates something we think here's the perfect god creating a perfect creation but then then the very next statement in verse 2 is and so god is joining this perfect creation which we just assume if god creates it and it comes from it would be perfect and so as we behold what's a perfect picture god inserts something very profound at the very beginning and he says and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep so this without form and void it means there was chaos god had created the heaven and the earth but now the earth is in a chaotic form it's confusion there's actually to say that it's void it's emptiness it would seem to be vanity there seemed to be no purpose to it so had we had the benefit of looking back and seeing something and say see this fluid mass darkness is upon the face of the deep there's no discernible land mass it's just a massive fluid and it's all chaotic and we would look at that and we'd say what do you see here say we don't see anything we see no purpose in this we see no design to it we don't understand even what what good this would be and so there would be a part of us perhaps in looking at it that would say well this is such a this is a worthless thing but god is wanting to express something to us in this because then it says and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good so god spoke the spirit of god began to move upon the face of the waters and as the spirit moves there's the voice that speaks because it's the voice of god that declares the presence of god tells us in the book of genesis that the voice of god was walking in the garden of eden it didn't have to be an animate man even a man in flesh but god's voice declares his presence there's a revelation there's a quickening to the voice of god that declares his presence and so god began the spirit of god begin to move upon the face of the waters and there's a word that spoke and let there be light and light comes forth and then god divides the light from the darkness and he calls the light day and the darkness night and he says this is the first day and what we see is that the word changed these dead chaotic elements the word where there was chaos there was void there was confusion there was emptiness the word spoken takes these things that seem to have no discernible purpose and no discernible use and it's void it's empty and all the adjectives that we could bring out from the original hebrew and the spirit of god and the voice of god began to arrange it and then begin to quicken it and as he began to quicken it this became the foundation of a perfect eden so the beginning of the perfect eden god wants us to catch and realize that at first it looked empty at first it looked void at first it looked like it was darkness and chaos and confusion and that it would that how could there be any good in this but then the word of god begins to move upon it brings order and then upon what used to be chaotic what used to be empty god brought an eden of holiness and eden of perfection and so what he wants us to recognize is even our own personal chaos even our own feeling of unworth and all the mistakes we've made all the darkness in our life and all the chaos and emptiness and void and all the vanity does not hinder god that if you feel empty you feel void you look back on your life and say even to this day at 42 years old it all just seems like one big gigantic mess up in a gigantic mass the spirit of god can move upon any life and the voice of god begin to speak and it brings order and will arrange things and bring another eden in your life and that's what god wants us to catch in this very image that we see at the beginning in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth but then the earth it represents something and the very first thing we can begin to identify with is that the earth was in chaos the earth had darkness in it it was upside down it was disorganized it had no direction but the spirit of god moved upon it and paul in writing in ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 to 7 he says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins it's the same thing that god did to the earth he now does to the individual you were dead in sins and trespasses but now he's quickened you and then he describes it this way where in time past you walk according to the course of this world we could even see it in the beginning that the course of this world even before there was flesh upon it it was chaotic it was dark it was confusing he says according to the prince of the power of the heir the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation and times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others you know there's no one that could read this and say not me it doesn't matter if you gave your heart to god at 12 years old and refilled the holy ghost at that very moment there's nobody that can say well i'm exempt from that this is one of those scriptures that we could say applies to every man born of a woman that we all walked in this manner we all had this lane in our flesh he says but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus so now we who were dead in sins walking according to the course of this world and this fallen condition there's a quickening and now he says we're seated in heavenly places right now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus he says that in the ages to come the time we're even living in right now he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus oh my that's beautiful so we can see in genesis chapter 1 verses verse 2 through 5 we can see ourselves in that and i believe that god wants us to identify with that it's okay to recognize your humanity and your weakness and it's okay to realize that you make mistakes because those things those things come with the fleshly part and it's when we try to use the fleshly part to prop up the fleshly part that we just are worse off pride is a nasty thing it'll cause you to sin but the worst part about pride is it keeps you in sin because it holds you there making excuses and we can just by humans today say yes we make mistakes we don't have it all figured out we don't have all the answers and i'll tell you right now even as as the minister today i don't know the answer to every question but i know one who does i know i have an answer to the devil's question but all the questions that we might be able to conjure up and all the things that we might be able to ask we don't know all the answers to the question but we know of christ who is the answer and so it's important for us to recognize even in this first part just through humility say i recognize with genesis chapter 1 verse 2 but then to avail ourselves to the spirit of god to yield ourselves to the voice of god to bring order where there was once chaos and i want to just focus on genesis chapter 1 verse 1 today and this is our first time meeting in this facility and if it's if it's warm to you i apologize it just reminds you that it's warmer outside and i was joking around in north carolina that we were moving to escape the heat because it's just so humid uh but it uh it's still hot still very hot and we're looking forward to that day here uh i believe that in the meeting in the air it'll just be right you know whatever you like it at it'll just be right whenever we come back in the millennium it'll just be right if you like it at 112 i believe you'll just feel it that way they say that in the wilderness that the word manno means what is it and that according to some jewish historians that the way that the tradition was passed down orally is that the manna tasted like whatever you wanted to taste whatever is pleasant to you whatever whatever tasted good so if we have man in the millennium it might taste a lot like rito's to me and so whatever temperature you want it to be at perhaps that's how you'll feel in the ages to come but in genesis chapter one verse one and i what i was thinking when i said that is just be patient with all the little things the sound doesn't work there's an echo it's hot in here let's just remember we're gathered around one thing that's the word not a building not a name not a personality we're just gathered around to hear the word because our little time here it's we're not living to go to church we go to church to live so we're gathering here today just to receive substance from the word of god not that we would leave here and just think in our minds well i got to live right so i can make it back to church again no we want to get something at church to live it's got to make a difference on a sunday evening and a monday morning and that's what we come to receive and if we are a little bit uncomfortable and things aren't just exactly right dear church just as long as we're getting something we can live by that's what matters in genesis chapter 1 1 i want to look at this in great detail and we just used that little bit of a foundation to recapture what was administered earlier this summer in the beginning god as we've looked at that at the beginning in god it says now he created and what he created was heaven and earth and in the hebrews beresheth borrow elohim in the beginning god in the beginning beresheth bara elohim in the beginning god created and what he did is he created the heaven and the earth some translations render it god in the beginning created the heavens and the earth so it places god at the beginning god in the beginning created the heaven and the earth and this word borah and the hebrew created it means to cause existence where previously to that moment there was nothing that existed so there hadn't been nothing no material nothing else existing god was the invisible god who existed in the realm all by himself but now it says in the beginning god created to create it means to bring something forth that had not previously had any being had not previously had any existence any physical existence and one translation says god in the beginning created substance of the heaven and the substance of the earth and and that really struck me that god in the beginning created something that became the substance of what the heavens became and what the earth became and so he brought into existence the first elements from which heaven and earth were later formed and we could see this very thing we could see this uh maybe these two layers to this scripture that god brought forth the substance from which creation came or from which he formed creation because the bible says in john chapter one in the beginning was the word and we know it's the word that begin to create john chapter one verses one to three in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so there was there was a form of being that god the invisible god formed himself into the logos and then from this body this theophany he began to create and in the beginning he brought forth substance that became the heavens he brought forth substance that became the earth in hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things that are seen were not made of things which do appear so by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and all things were made by the word and proceeded forth from the word and so in the beginning god created brought forth substance that began to bring forth the heaven and the earth and i want to look at these two elements the heaven and the earth and this has just been burning on my heart for some time and i'm so grateful to have the privilege of sharing it with you today he made the heaven and the the heaven the first heaven that god made was the very habitation of elohim that god who is the invisible god he dwelt we could say in a dimension that was his alone it really was the only thing that was and it was just god if we were to imagine me uh being alone in this room today or me being alone or existing by myself you would try to imagine me within some space and you say well brother aaron's at home alone and so you would picture some dimension and space and there would be all these different elements that we begin to comprehend what makes someone alone but god wasn't alone in that there was space and there was other room for others he was alone and that that was all there was god was the only space god was the only being and he just existed all by himself so when he formed himself into the word of the logos he had he brings forth the heaven that he that there's a dimension now of heaven that becomes the habitation of elohim the heavens of heavens the highest order and we see these dimensions and it's also referred to as the tabernacle of god and so the heaven i want to just put this image before you today the heaven represents the supernatural and when we speak of heaven god is identified with heaven jesus said my father which is in heaven and he referred to the father which is in heaven we think of heaven as being a dimension of glory a dimension of the supernatural a dimension of the divine and it's it's appropriate to begin to think that way god created the heaven it's a dimension that's associated with him and if you take it just another step down and ponder how the stars and the galaxies in the universe are also declared as the heavens god identified himself with the heavens and wrote his first bible in the stars so the stars and the galaxies and all the things that are up there and even this other supernatural part that we're pointing to it's it's it's symbolized and represents the the habitation of god the dwelling place of god so the stars and the galaxies the whole universe can also be signified into heaven so you have the heaven that's created then you can see that this is the habitation of god god writes his first bible there it's the first place that god is being expressed you can see it even be expressed in the sun in different ways that you could draw this out in all the different constellations god is expressing himself in the heavenlies but remember that it's the tabernacle of god it's the dwelling place of god the heaven is then he says god created not just the heaven but he also created the earth and when he creates the earth this is the land as opposed to heaven and it's interesting to note that from the moment that god says god created the heaven and he says and the earth from this point on the narrative only relates to the earth we're not told a story in another galaxy everything that takes place is take place within relation to the earth even if you bring up the image of of satan coming before the lord in the book of job and you see some sort of heavenly scene nothing that's being expressed doesn't have some connection with what's taking place on earth so the narrative from this moment on even in creation in the rest of the book of genesis what's being expressed is everything that relates to where we are now the natural things that we see and all the senses that we use to contact this earth so now what he brings forth is that there's a heaven and now there is an earth and god intended something glorious to be declared in this verse very simple verse and i'm sure all of us should have it memorized if you need a bible memory verse let's just all remember genesis 1 1 this week in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth that's i think that's simple enough for all of us but god is decl is intending something glorious by this verse and if you could for a moment just maybe humor me i was just sitting back thinking about it this past week this bible is god in written form the stars is the first bible that god wrote then god has preserved himself in a written bible so think of how tremendous and important the very first words of the bible would be god the way god starts is the way god finishes god's got to start a particular way he begins a particular way and so think of how important genesis 1 1 must be because it sets in motion the unfolding of god and i believe that when god said in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth he wrapped up so much truth in this one statement that the further revelation of it can get so deep and so deep that it'll draw you away from carnal things it'll cause you to see things from a completely different perspective because god in one verse has articulated his great plan he sets it all in motion here and he lays it out before us that in this creation this is the first creation that it's expressed god in the beginning created the heaven and the earth and this is how important this scripture is and i want to use a few statements from brother branham to show how we can look at this and understand that this is significant because it's god showing something he makes this statement the resurrection can be proved by looking at the creator how that he created all this botany life and how everything serving his purpose must die and if it dies it lives again because it's got perpetual life but the only way it can live again is a germatized seed so he's saying that we can look at the natural course of flowers and plants and see dying and coming back up again and we can see that even the creation expresses resurrection and it's proved by looking at how the creator put these symbols in creation or in natural life in botany life and we can see this type natural declaring the spiritual he says this though now god expresses himself in that creation and it shows that all these pagan gods and things that we that we have are not right they're just philosophy imaginations but the one who created the heaven and earth expresses himself back through his creation and what he is in his program now we should take this as commentary on genesis 1 1 that the very one who created in the heaven the earth expresses himself back through that creation so that we can see what he is and his program so in genesis 1 1 god expresses himself and his program seems very simple in the beginning god created the heaven and earth and some say well to me that means that god had the ability to create and he created a universe and an earth within that universe that's kind of like a sandbox and now he's the he's a god that set everything in motion so he just now sits back with his arms folded kind of seeing how things will play out but yet god expresses something greater in that verse than just a man creating a sandbox god expresses himself in that creation the one who created the heaven and the earth expresses himself back through that creation and the message letting off the pressure he says we know that this world is a creation and before there can be a creation there has to be a creator of that creation and this creator expresses himself in the creation hold that thought in your mind it says in the beginning god the creator created the heaven and the earth so god is the creator the heaven and the earth are his creation and brother brahm is saying god expresses himself in the creation so god has expressed himself in heaven and earth there's an expression of him in this creation if we did not even have a bible we still know that that's the truth just as we do the bible only sets it in order now god created the creation is expressing himself back in the creation so there's there's more depth to it uh there's more meaning to it than just uh you and i taking substance and building something and say well this is my great work this is my great masterpiece we say oh well look at what brother aaron built and all we know he likes this color and we know he likes this design and you try to see myself in that it's very different what god did he continues and he's not a god just of one solid sears and roebuck harmony house he's a god of variety he makes big hills and little hills he makes the deserts and he makes lakes and he makes little trees and big trees and white flowers and red flowers and makes little men and big men and red-headed women and black-headed women and he makes us different because he wants us that way shouldn't that just allow us just to rest in how god has made us he's a god of variety and he makes some rich and some poor some in between but we've got a place to serve god and that's the place that he's placed us in if we'll just abide in that place beautiful words there of encouragement and admonishment just to be who god's made you to be and variety is beautiful to god and so as he says this there's different ways that god expresses himself so it's not a matter of all of us just trying to conform to a particular attitude or particular way but allowing god to express himself through our being but the point that i'm really wanting to draw from this is that god expresses himself in the thing that he creates the one who created the heaven and the earth expresses himself back through the heaven and the earth god creating the creation is expressing himself back in the creation so we read in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth god expresses himself in heaven and earth this is the first expression of god that we're introduced to we could we could we could maybe some would might disagree with this statement but i can personally say for myself i i was not introduced to an image before in the beginning or john 1 in the beginning was the word i had no concept of that until the prophet comes back and begins to describe how this infinite invisible god forms himself into a low gospel and this becomes an expression of god then what we're introduced to in genesis 1 1 in the beginning god elohim the covenant god created the heaven and the earth and so god wants us to catch this expression because what is he foreshadowing in this if he expresses himself in that creation he expresses himself back through his creation god creating the creation is expressing himself back in the creation so that we could see what he is in his program what is he showing us and the word express is brother madam uses this word it's to represent in visual art or to put into words that is just one sense of an expression you have a thought you try to express it in a visual way or put it into words and in that sense we say a word is a thought expressed but the word if you look at the etymology of it means to press or to squeeze out or to speak one's mind so to express something something's being pressed or squeezed out and so it creates this picture if one is expressing something something is being squeezed out and taken out of their mind and put into form and we see this happening it had to be there in god's thoughts in god's heart and in the latin it means to represent to describe to portray to imitate and it literally means to press out and i might be getting a few on my side today even me maybe my brother matthew would just really rally behind this but this word to express in the latin it literally means to press out and it's the source of the word la italian word espresso can i get an amen anybody want to amend me here now i got everybody's attention may god just give the caffeine of that to us now and energize us spiritually claim it but he so it comes from this expression or expressed the english word we use this is what's portrayed in the italian word espresso from x which is out a prasar to pressure to push to press or to push out the the latin root to that means to press to hold fast and it it the word the picture word that's created it's in the sense of how that may be clay under pressure takes the form of an image and that's when you when you espresso and i don't pretend to know how it works and i'm sure there's many that will just correct me on it but there's a pressing that takes place to make the espresso to get the the life out of that being to get the flavor out of the caffeine especially and it does it in such a way to where it presents something that can be enjoyed it's taking the substance of that being and through pressure presses out an expression of it presses out a different image or manifestation of it so this expression that brother madam is using god expresses himself in that creation god has expressed himself back in that creation so we can know what he is in his program there's a sense of something being formed in something being made manifest like you could take a clay and press an image into it and you see something being expressed but god does not create like an artist god does not create like a barista god is not like any one of us at our espresso machine making coffee it's not something that he's created that's a standalone but he wants to become expressed it's something that's becoming tangible it's something that's becoming material and this invisible god when he begins to express it's not just a reflection but it is him it's the becoming god he's not just painting the picture and handing it out or taking a picture and distributing and saying oh this is a reflection of him this is an image of but no this is him this is god making himself known this is god sharing with us so that we through the learn we can learn through the comfort and patience of scripture have hope and so what is created reflects what is in god's mind he says that's what an expression is to press out to squeeze out to speak one's mind so this is it's being squeezed out is being portrayed and what's the first expression we see in genesis 1 the first expression in the bible the heaven and the earth and this is what this is where maybe if i was better at this i could save this for the end and just kind of bring it in the way to where it's like ah aha but what he's expressed here in heaven and earth he portrays the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride in the very first verse of the bible there's christ and there's you in the beginning god pressed himself out brought for squeezed out of his mind a groom and a bride represented as a heavenly bridegroom and an earthly bride because we know he made the earth to get a bride out of him so they're not expressed as separate conditions or separate creations when they're created he expresses them as being created together and and although we can see in language and maybe in position we might say maybe one was greater than the other one was here and one was there one was higher one was lower but they're coexisting together it doesn't say in the beginning god created the heaven and then and then it takes the earth and it's created uh later on or he he says this is something i'm representing in the very beginning regardless of the condition of it regardless of how much time passes the image i want my believer to see that in the beginning they were just as much in my mind as christ was in my mind that my expression is not complete without heaven and earth though i made known in christ jesus though i was expressed in the sun there's more to that expression there is a wife there's a bride that must come forth so he says i have created heaven and earth together coexisting so they're they're together and brother banham talks about uh and and i want to use this very quickly he says we're so great it's just to see this harmony this is what i was thinking heaven and earth existing and the harmony among between them brahman says we're so glad that we can look up and see the stars in the skies and the moon and the great solar system as it revolves in such perfect harmony and the earth is part of that harmony it's remarkable that a a comet can pass by and scientists could say you won't see that again for 324 years and 12 minutes you're like what really and then if time passes they just can like clock work it's going to come right back around again wow there's a timing there's an order there's a harmony to all these things the earth exists within the solar system and within the heavens it exists in harmony by gravitational pull and it's it's circling around the sun in each one in their places god is showing that there's a harmony that's even existing with the earth within the rest of the greater whole and brother branham uses this thought and greatest battle ever fought and i thought of the order of that heavenly host not one of them is out of place everyone keeps his time perfectly he says god's great army i thought of the soldiers how that if that moon would ever get out of order notice what he says the earth would be covered up with water in just a few minutes so there's something about the heavenlies that keeps order in the earthly and if the heavenly god out of place it would cause chaos upon the earth so there's there's an expression here of harmony and continuity that god wants to see between heaven and earth he said the earth would be just like it was when god decided to use it for us to have us here on it it was without form and void and darkness was upon the face that was upon the breath of the earth and if that moon would ever move it would do the same thing again so god is expressing that there's he intends to have harmony between heaven and earth that if the the heavenly was to get out of order it would cause chaos upon the earth but as long as the earth is in direct in the right relationship with the moon and the moon doesn't move out of position or the earth doesn't move out of position the earth is safe it won't return back to void it won't return back to darkness he says when the moon rocks a little bit away from the earth the tide comes up when it goes down it follows the ties it's god's great army so we could see then that there was a dependency of the earth upon the heavens and in the beginning god is showing his plan of harmony between christ and his bride now let's not look at that arrangement as being three different things or three different entities but really just one expressed in two it's the invisible god expressed in groom the invisible god expressed in bride and so god in the beginning is showing his plan of harmony between christ and his bride now just to take it a step further the bible refers to in the beginning of the creation of god and brother branham identifies that as being jesus christ and in mark chapter one and i want to read it very quickly in three different places so you can see how the emphasis of the gospels trying to expressing this principle because i'm wanting to look at in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now we identify with the earth none of us were born in heaven show of hands right so we all we all are related very well to this earth to the natural things but yet now god when he's when jesus christ comes notice the language that is used at the baptism on the jordan river mark chapter 1 verses 9 to 11. and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan and straightway coming out up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descended upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and it's not just a father pleased with this son but in whom i am well pleased to dwell in he's not just saying i'm real proud of your son but now he's indwelling the sun there's there's a union that's taking place it's it's written this way matthew chapter 3 verses 16 to 17 and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and low a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son and who i am well pleased again the heavens opened the spirit of the lord descending upon him lighting upon him like a dove descending upon him a voice of god identifying himself with this dissension of the spirit it says in john chapter 1 verse 32 and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him so we see an image of the heavenlies opening up and it coming down to abide on flesh coming down to abide upon jesus christ and it's an indwelling it's it's a it's a the holy spirit coming and identifying himself with the man christ jesus coming coming to unite with him and this is the language that brother branham uses and this is what and again we're reading from genesis chapter 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now at the baptism of jesus christ we see the heavens open up the spirit like a dove descending upon jesus who is now in flesh it's a it's a flesh man he's we could say in one sense he's 100 man but yet the blood that was in him was divine it was it was the blood of god it wasn't any other blood so the deity of jesus christ relates to his blood but now at the jordan river something is happening to this cree this creation something's happening to this son who's now flesh and blood who is now walking in flesh who's a young baby that was born in a manger and grows up and we see a glimpse of him at 12 years old and the bible says he increased in wisdom and his stature and in favor with god and man so now this is flesh that is growing just like you and i this isn't flesh like melchizedek where god just creates a body blows himself into it walks it now this is a this is a man this is a man with a with a desire this is a man with passions this is a man who had his own will he said not my will but thy will be done so what happens here on the jordan river has great significance for us because brother bottom uses there's several places we could read from to use this but he says in the message the lamb and the dove when this dove came from the heavens the meekest bird of all the heavens came to the meekest animal and all the earth heaven and earth kissed each other heaven and earth was united together so this is the image now it is baptism heaven and earth are now uniting in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth again in another message called lamb and dove all with a confirmation to see a lamb and dove come together heaven and earth united god and man united he's shown a union now heaven and earth united heaven and earth united says in another place when the dove settled down on the lamb heaven and earth embraced each other and kissed in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth now in in the beginning of the creation of god jesus christ there's a time when heaven and earth are embracing and kissing he says in another message god making his promise that was the greatest event that this world has ever seen and will see when heaven and earth kissed he said it was the greatest event this world ever seen and we'll see until until christ and the church has united together again oh hallelujah i just have to express it now and not save it for the end once again heaven and earth are kissing once again heaven and earth are uniting together so once again it's the greatest event this world has ever seen the greatest event this world has ever seen and we'll see until christ and the church is united together again that is when god and man became one heaven and earth embraced each other and kissed each other and settled the sin question forever is when the dove and the lamb united together says again in one other place he says many people bypass this scripture but to me it's one of the most outstanding it's one of the outstanding scriptures of the bible that when heaven and earth embraced when god came down in the form of a dove and went upon his son in the form of a lamb when god in christ became one when the dove came down on the lamb heaven and earth kissed each other god and man was reconciled together why it's one of the greatest moments in the world ever have that when man and god was reconciled together the dove and the lamb came together heaven and earth kissed one of the greatest greatest moments the world ever had has ever seen or will see until until you see the picture that's being painted in the beginning god created the heaven and earth it's not just it's not just a a rough start to god trying to tell a great story it's almost as if he told the whole story in one verse in the beginning god created the expression of a bridegroom and he created an expression of a bride that would be united and live forever in eternity and we even understand in the beginning god created they have an earth period we don't know how long it got here or how long it was here we don't know how long it existed when people say well this rock's billions and billions of years old i i don't argue with them on that i'm sometimes perplexed by the methods they use and and i don't quite understand the science and you realize it takes there's a level of faith that they have in the process to come to arrive so conclusively at this number no it is exactly 3.2 billion years old well could it be 3.1 oh hold on there buddy you know don't mess with science no it's 3.2 very precise very adamant very focused this is what it's supposed to be and so but god is expressing something eternal related to you and i and then genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and then in revelations chapter 21 verses 1 to 3 john says and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more seed now this this seems uh very striking and i want to come to a place in future home where brother ram deals with this the new heaven and the new earth are seen they're visualizing he says the first heaven and the first earth are passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven so now we see something coming down out of god out of the heaven which is the tabernacle of god and he sees what is called a new jerusalem but then he says prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so when he sees the city his inspiration it's a woman it's a bride he's told he's going to go see the bride and he's shown a city if we read later in the same chapter because what is being expressed is the wife the lamb's wife she has made herself ready so as this city comes down out of heaven out of god the new jerusalem prepared as a bride adorned for her husband it's connected with the new heaven and the new earth it's an expression of new heaven and new earth he says and i heard a great voice out of saying out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men because now it has come down out of heaven from god out of heaven and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god what has what's transpiring in this what john has seen in the end which holds a great truth for us now he is seeing where heaven is now fused and united with earth there's not gonna there's not gonna be a heaven and here we are on earth and we're praying to a god in heaven he's actually saying that now the tabernacle of god is with men and heaven and earth have been fused together and now this is god's permanent dwelling what god had in his mind in the beginning that he wanted to become it now he's saying it's now finally in the image that he had in the beginning to where now it's being expressed where now god is tabernacling with man in this new jerusalem in this new heaven and new earth the heaven is now united with the earth permanently god's permanent dwelling that's why it's called the tabernacle of god is now with men whereas there is god in heaven god in heaven now there's a union in the fusion that takes place expressed here in revelations 21. now watch how brother branham addresses this scripture he reads a few other passages and it's in the sermon future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride it's it's tapped into in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth it's tapped into where the heaven and earth embraced and kissed at the time of jesus christ on earth is tapped into revelations 21 the new heaven and the earth it's a union together and the future home and he reads in these different places and he reads especially from revelations 21 he says by these passages one might think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this earth will be destroyed he says i will make a new heaven and a new earth see that the heavens will be gone and the earth will be gone completely annihilated he said if one reads this they could be led to believe that there's a total annihilation of the earth and there's a new earth that comes forward he says but a close study and with the help of the holy spirit we can see the truth of this and that's what we're going to get into we're going into it's only the atmos atmospheres around it and the sin that's upon the earth that will be destroyed why because the earth was an original spoken word attribute of god and notice how he walks us through this we realize that the heavens means the atmosphere is above what does it do it then these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits will all be gone away and annihilated and remember whatever god does to the earth he also does to the person so this is your promise you can hold on to these things that whatever these sicknesses and these thistles and these politics and whatever evil spirits you can be delivered of these things annihilated so it has to be done that way because we're going to live right here we'll prove that by the bible right here is where we live notice thistles germs all sickness and things will be completely taken away all this its existence that's in the earth now man-made systems politics sin all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and all the heaven the heavens above us in here is contaminated with evil spirit now we're going to go deep and long in this not me this is brother brown i'm saying this you may say well too late brother aaron i know i made the mistake of not looking at my watch but i'm kind of i'm i'm i'm paying attention to the time he says we're going to go deep and long in this all this exists in the heavens or atmospheres and the earth which is now this earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused it to be like that it was made by god the creator and all our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when god created it because you're dust out of the earth it was all laid out there when god himself created it you were in his thinking so in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth you are in his thinking so he gives you an expression of something that you can identify yourself with in the void and the emptiness and the darkness and we can relate to that why you were in his thinking in the beginning he knew the way that you would come he knew the path that you would take so he lays a pattern of redemption he lays a seed of hope so that there's no life here today that has endured abuse or suffering or sickness or doubt or even stumblings or backslidings and even the things that we say from our mouth we shake our fisted god that god laid a pattern in scripture so that you too yourself could believe his love towards you is redemptive and he'll reach to you wherever you are paul even said it of himself you know what i i was made a blasphemer so that everyone could have hope in redemption i know i'm paraphrasing maybe a new translation there but just to put it in our in a way that we could understand some modern language he said look my life my testimony expresses and declares i even a blasphemer have received grace he says why so that i could be an example he was made for that purpose god when he created you were in his thinking in him the great eternal was the thought which is his attribute and now sin caused all this to happen and god through this age through this age is gathering up his material amen it was all laid there in the earth you were in his thinking from the very moment when heaven and earth came forward you were in his thinking you were in his mind he says now in this age he's gathering up his material in this time right now he's gathering up the ordained material that he laid in the earth isn't that wonderful to think of that so he comes to the very end that was in paragraph 65 a future home of the heavenly bridegroom the bridegroom represented in heaven and the bride represented as the earth he says this in paragraph 4 44 as he comes to the end notice the tabernacle of god will be with man the former things has passed away this thing has passed away this means that heaven has come down to resident with man heaven and earth are embraced just exactly when the dove came on part of the earth which was jesus he was dust of the earth man god coming from that one little life germ by creative power and that blood that was in that the life that was in that blood ascended back to god but the blood dripped upon the earth to claim it he says this means heaven and has passed and come down to be resonant with man heaven and earth are embraced just like it happened in jesus at his baptism he's wanting us to see this image that now for us there's something very uh personal that we can identify ourselves with in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth something very personal we can begin to identify with jesus at his baptism that even though he were son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered though he was made perfect and made sinless he had to come to a place of surrender at the jordan river even when john says i i'm not worthy to baptize you because uh us to fulfill all righteousness i must humble myself to the will of god gives us hope hope of regeneration hope of a new birth it's the covenant god who's expressed his ambition and desire in genesis 1 1 the covenant god heaven and earth groom and bride christ represented in his own personal ministry heaven and earth embracing brother branham says this in church in its condition uh and i'm just i'm drawing i'm drawing to a close here i'm just very very close so i have one maybe lengthy statement to read from if christ is a mystery and just two other statements before this just to bring it to this this climax here heaven and earth embracing heaven and earth kissing the word being united by abraham says this about that event and john said i bear records seeing the spirit of god like a dove coming down and abiding on him hallelujah he says there you are i i don't know if he's saying there you are and like i'm trying to identify that that's what i was telling you about but it strikes me as him telling me there i am can you see yourself heaven and earth embracing the spirit of god like a dove coming down and abiding on him there you are can you identify yourself personally with that he says the dove and the lamb united together that's when god and men became one that's when heaven and earth embraced each other hallelujah that's when god was made flesh that's when the word was made flesh that's when god was made perfectly flesh at that time of that union at the jordan river that's when god was made flesh brought it that's when god came down from the spirit form and was made a man and dwelt among us that's when all eternity embraced each other that's why you were represented there that's why you have personal representation in jesus christ that's why we believe in him was she and him was the bride in him was the expression of a woman that would come forth as a church that would be his bride she says that that was when god was made flesh so brother brown takes the sermon invisible union of the bride of christ it is the invisible union of the earthly bride to her heavenly bridegroom he has made himself known in this day so that we could know our mate the revealed word it is the the heavenly bridegroom uniting with the earthly bride to take us to our future home to bring us to that place where we would reside in our future home so brother when preaching that sermon he says in jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that i might become him the word let me hold true to it not the church the word our allegiance is not to a church our allegiance is to the word he says oh amen oh that spiritual union of christ and his church now because remember when he said earlier that was the greatest event this world had ever seen and we'll see until christ and the church unites together again so when he says all that spiritual union to christ and his church now he's saying now it's the repeat of the greatest event now the earth is seen again when it saw when christ was there in the jordan river all the spiritual union of christ this church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh we saw the word become flesh in jesus christ now flesh is becoming word i don't think you just got it turned around i just believe there's something special in there for me personally i can see the word made flesh in christ oh let me see my flesh become made word he says the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day why it's accumulating so fast out there in those deserts amen and these things taking place that i couldn't even keep up with it we're nearing the coming of jesus to be united with this church that's what that coming represents a union united where the word becomes the word call of the holy spirit he says searching the hearts god was made flesh that day when heaven and earth embraced now once again heaven and earth are embracing and it's not just the word being made flesh but flesh being made word he says it's word becoming the word i want to read this statement from christ is the mystery of god revealed that's lengthy i'm starting with paragraph 476 he says it's god in man that's his manifestation that's what he's revealing that's what he's trying to do in god's own word revealing it it shows that man cannot create and i believe he's using moses as an example just prior to this he says god is the creator and it ain't man no more i don't mind using ain't there it ain't man no more it's god the creator in man which is his church now he says amen going home to heaven that's the season we're living in it's god in his bride going home to heaven live with him ever god expresses eternal love to his church he says listen listen close now i want you to not to fail to get this no other church no other sign no other fellowship no other government no other testimony no the creed no denomination is accepted outside of this god accepts nothing else but that christ in you the hope of glory the only thing that god recognizes no fellowship no church he's repeating it again no fellowship no church no creed no denomination no nothing everything else is dead it's fragments that has to be cut off pruned off away from the thing that christ might live with preeminences in you so let's examine ourselves to be sure that we have not tied ourselves to anything that would keep him from having preeminence in us as he says no other church no sign of fellowship government testimony created denomination everything else has to be cut off all the fragments pruned off that he might have preeminences in you says not referring back got one limp here that says it's my organization that's got to be cut off i got my soul and so here this says this my mother tells me i'm a holy oh that's got to be cut off too well i know my husband wants me to wear these shorts that's got to be cut off too it's got to be cut off and pruned till that's just you and christ alone think by the living presence of the living christ by the living word oh living christ living presence living word that's what i want living christ's living presence living word he says watch by his own personal personal vindication proves his church not members he never done it in the days of moses he never done it in the days of anybody else at the end of the world when it come to the place where it was the destruction the days of lot it wasn't membership it was personal vindication god and flesh see personal vindication that's what we encourage is personal vindication not our own ministers do not seek their own personal vindication but your personal vindication that christ could be personally vindicated in your life that you could have an assurance that you've been bought with the price that you've been sealed with the holy ghost that you're walking in the path that he has for your life it doesn't matter if a church is vindicated doesn't matter if a ministry is vindicated what matters is that you are personally vindicated by a living christ a living presence a living word oh we could take those names and attach them to a church but what matters is that it's personally vindicated in your life the personal vindication god and flesh the personal vindication will invite the musicians to come he says remember think of that people born in his spirit in a day like this in this great denominational age that we live in and the living god takes his living word and vindicates it personally that this life that's in the word the germ that's in the seed and the word is a seed that sower went forth to sow and the life is christ and the word in the word personally in you vindicating something that you cannot do proving himself that it's not you but it's him this is what we are holding to this is what we're believing for a living god takes his living word and vindicates it personally this life that's in the word in you proving himself that it's not you that it's him and you've become one a love slave to him to be a bride the song i was thinking is the key of see going home i'm going home there's nothing to hold me here you've become one a love slave to him to be a bride thanks be to the living god who created the heavens and the earth and all that's in the midst in the midst of the heaven and the earth thanks be to god he brings that image up right in the middle of this passage thanks be to god who created the heaven and the earth why because what we're reading here is what was in genesis 1 1. what brother brahm is expressing in christ is the mystery god revealed what was in the back part of god's mind he says just now being made known to the church what he was wanting to achieve what he was wanting to accomplish what he was wanting to express that's what was in genesis 1 1. it was there in the heaven and earth that he created it was just hid as a mystery thanks be to god the living god who created the heaven and the earth no wonder he's alpha and omega the beginning and the ending he was that which is and shall come the root and offspring of david the bride in morning star he is all in all his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a a vindication of the great revelation of god who's the great vindication of the great revelation of god who is it just one person that's all it takes it says you are a vindication of the great revelation of god look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group this is if you read it this is just what he's saying over and over it's a great it's a vindication of the great revelation expressing itself through you he says look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual he wants you to individually identify yourself with him in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth i want i i it should be a revelation to you that in the beginning we created the heaven i was represented in that earth not to end in chaos not to end in sadness and sorrow and disunity but because i was linked with that heaven and there's some that will leave for a later time it's in this hour it's united again heaven and earth have embraced when christ the word comes to your heart and makes himself known could we just bow our heads for a moment why don't we just stand to our feet and we'll offer prayer for you he says it's to an individual never a group an individual i could say we've stood as a group maybe there'd be some here today that would want to ask the lord to be personally identified with you and you'd want to just raise your hand and say lord identify yourself with me lord maybe you'd say lord i identify with genesis 1 2 darkness void confusion chaos you say lord identify yourself with me as the spirit of god would move upon the face of my deep let the spirit of god move upon my chaos and my hurt and my sorrow let it move upon me lord identify yourself with me if our heads bowed let us just pray our gracious heavenly father lord we see a beautiful picture unfolding in just one verse we see how you in the beginning expressed yourself as a heaven and an earth and it represents christ the word and his bride the word and we come down to this age the age where you're gathering up your material and lord we may feel lost and broken we may feel useless and cast aside and we may feel that many years have been wasted wandering around but lord how long did that earth lay there in that condition for an appointed time where you begin to move and begin to speak lord may it be a young soul's appointed time today maybe a maybe a backslidden believer lord whoever it might be that would fall under the voice of this message lord may this be the moment the time where they realize the spirit of god is moving upon their chaos moving upon their years of brokenness moving upon their years of turmoil and he's going to bring order going to bring beauty i pray father you would meet us in our needs you'd touch us where we're hurting heal us where we're sick father put us on the right path where we veered from you lord and i asked today that your presence would come and identify yourself with those who lifted their hands and desired oh god oh god personally identify yourself with me not to vindicate a group not to vindicate or gather not to vindicate an assembly but for the personal vindication lord that's what we desire to see is your member the members of your body the members of your bride would come to a place of a solid revelation of who they are in you take their stand lord may they be anchored in this revelation lord may it be christ in them the hope of glory heaven and earth you 19 once again we commit the people to you today lord praying for those who may be sick those there's some here lord desire to be here but couldn't be whatever the situation are you lord we just place it before you now lord as we're going to be dismissed shortly lord we just pray that you be with those who've driven driven long distances be with those who've gathered over arizona some driving maybe some linked father we pray that you be with them and bless them in their journey and i pray father that you you alone the word would be their portion as they go and bless them father as they hold to these words i ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] going home i am home oh there is nothing to hold
