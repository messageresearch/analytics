[0:00] man
[0:01] amen god bless you good to see all of
[0:02] you tonight happy to be in the house of
[0:05] the lord and if you grab your bibles
[0:06] we're going to be reading from john
[0:07] chapter 6.
[0:10] and
[0:11] when i was looking at it earlier today i
[0:13] was wanting to read
[0:14] maybe a pretty big chunk of it
[0:17] and
[0:19] i uh
[0:23] i think we're just going to start with
[0:24] verse 22 and read to verse 35
[0:28] even though it was the entire chapter
[0:30] that really covers
[0:32] a lot and has
[0:34] just paints a really beautiful picture
[0:36] we'll just make reference to some of
[0:37] these things um as we go forward but
[0:39] john chapter 6 starting with verse 22.
[0:42] we'll read to verse 35
[0:44] the day following this is after he's
[0:46] walked on the sea the day followed when
[0:47] the people which stood on the other side
[0:49] of the sea
[0:50] so we know that he's crossed over
[0:53] to the other side of the sea he saw that
[0:54] there was none other boat there saved
[0:56] the one where
[0:57] into his disciples were entered that
[1:00] jesus went not with his disciples into
[1:01] the boat but that his disciples were
[1:03] gone away alone
[1:05] how be it there came other boats from
[1:06] tiberius nigh unto the place where they
[1:09] did eat bread after that the lord had
[1:10] given things when the people therefore
[1:13] saw that jesus was not there neither his
[1:15] disciples they also took shipping and
[1:17] came to capernaum seeking for jesus
[1:20] when they had found him on the other
[1:21] side of the sea they said unto them
[1:23] rabbi when camest thou hither jesus
[1:26] answered them and said verily verily i
[1:28] send to you you seek me not because you
[1:31] saw the miracles but because you did eat
[1:33] the loaves and were filled
[1:35] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[1:36] but for that meat which endureth unto
[1:38] everlasting life which the son of man
[1:40] shall give unto you for him hath god the
[1:43] father sealed
[1:44] then said they unto him well what shall
[1:46] we do that we might work the works of
[1:48] god and jesus answered and said to them
[1:50] this is the work of god that you believe
[1:52] on him whom he hath sent they said
[1:54] therefor unto him what sign shows thou
[1:56] then that we may see and believe thee
[1:58] and what does and what dost thou work
[2:01] our fathers did eat man in the in the
[2:03] desert as it is written he gave them
[2:04] bread from heaven to eat
[2:06] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[2:08] i say unto you moses gave you not that
[2:10] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[2:12] you the true bread from heaven for the
[2:14] bread of god which he which
[2:16] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[2:18] giveth life unto the world
[2:20] sin said the unto the lord him lord
[2:22] evermore give us this bread jesus said
[2:24] to them i am the bread of life he that
[2:26] cometh to me shall never hunger and he
[2:28] that believeth on me shall never thirst
[2:30] but i send to you that ye also have seen
[2:32] me and believe not
[2:34] and all that the father they have given
[2:36] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[2:38] to me while i know why is cast out
[2:40] for i am come down from heaven
[2:43] not to
[2:44] seek my own but the will of him that
[2:46] sent me and this is the father's will
[2:48] which hath sent me that of all which he
[2:51] hath given me i shall lose nothing but
[2:53] should raise it up again and at the last
[2:55] day and this is the will of him that
[2:57] sent me that everyone which seeth the
[2:59] son and believeth on him may have
[3:01] everlasting life and i'll raise him up
[3:03] at the last day
[3:05] amen god bless you you could be seated
[3:08] we're continuing on the subject of
[3:09] christ my healer
[3:11] and i
[3:14] just feel impressed to try to cover as
[3:16] much ground as we can we have the
[3:17] opportunity on this subject it is um
[3:20] focusing on the the specifically on
[3:23] divine healing god's power to heal
[3:26] and what its purpose is there's a divine
[3:28] purpose to this divine healing and we
[3:31] mentioned sunday morning at the outset
[3:32] that just at its core divine healing
[3:35] points to the promise of full redemption
[3:38] and some may say well it seems pretty
[3:40] plain in scripture that god heals the
[3:42] bible says i am the lord that healeth
[3:43] all thy diseases we see that jesus went
[3:45] about healing and performing great
[3:47] miracles we see that it continued in the
[3:49] lives of the apostles we've witnessed it
[3:51] in our own lives and we've seen the
[3:53] power of god to heal and it might seem
[3:55] that
[3:57] may be too fundamental or maybe a waste
[3:59] of time to go over these things but
[4:01] brother abraham said the devil fights
[4:02] this wonderful truth of divine healing
[4:05] and marks it up so it's a truth that the
[4:07] devil would like to mark up it's a truth
[4:09] that the devil would want us to get out
[4:11] of balance
[4:12] and on sunday we were looking at a
[4:15] tipping point and look at uh kind of
[4:17] using the idea that there's a kind of an
[4:19] accumulation of things and just a series
[4:22] of small incidences that may be uh
[4:24] discrete or inperceivable might be
[4:26] something that is um just in small
[4:29] increments but eventually it builds to a
[4:31] point to where it tips over and it's
[4:32] called a tip point or a tipping point
[4:35] and at the point that it tips it can be
[4:36] something very very significant that
[4:38] happens
[4:39] and underneath some you know the
[4:42] watchful eye something just slowly
[4:44] slowly is building and then when it
[4:46] manifests it's like wow how did it ever
[4:48] get to this point that something so big
[4:50] can happen it had just been slowly
[4:52] building and slowly building and we
[4:54] talked about how it kind of comes that
[4:55] critical mass to a point where things
[4:57] change or a boiling point
[4:59] and we looked at it from the standpoint
[5:01] that there can be both the positive
[5:04] side of that and then also a negative
[5:07] and tonight i want to take um the
[5:09] subtitle of the minor leads to the major
[5:13] and and you're familiar with the
[5:14] statements brother says you can't major
[5:16] on a minor i've been reading through
[5:17] every single place where brother bam
[5:19] says it catching the context of it uh
[5:21] wanting to understand exactly what he
[5:22] meant what the majors are what the
[5:24] minors are but we in looking at this the
[5:27] minor when i say the minor there's
[5:29] because there's many different minors
[5:30] but there's one major but where you see
[5:33] the minor the minors to lead you to the
[5:35] major and that's my
[5:36] thought i want to continue on and it
[5:38] ties connect very well in with the
[5:40] tipping point
[5:42] now the one of the statements we read on
[5:44] sunday from the sermon the angel of god
[5:47] touches on this idea of this tipping
[5:49] point in the negative way now the angel
[5:51] god told me it would come to pass that
[5:53] they wouldn't believe unless there was a
[5:55] miracle and your words have been proved
[5:58] and this is what he says in his prayer
[6:00] and he's just he's looking at the
[6:01] phenomenon of he comes with signs and
[6:04] wonders and miracles and you think this
[6:06] is getting the people to believe and if
[6:07] you can get the people to believe
[6:09] nothing can stand in your way not even
[6:11] cancer and so here's god manifest
[6:14] himself in a ministry in a way that uh
[6:16] had not been seen just very powerful
[6:19] very very vindicated
[6:21] and it it finally worked to a point to
[6:23] where the people's faith weren't go it
[6:25] wasn't getting stronger is actually
[6:27] getting to where they had to see a
[6:29] miracle to believe
[6:31] i know it may seem a little bit
[6:32] counter-intuitive but this is the danger
[6:34] line or the tipping point that you see
[6:36] so much of the supernatural to where you
[6:38] are actually looking to that and need
[6:41] that to have faith instead of all that
[6:44] time your faith is actually building to
[6:46] say i don't need to see a sign i know
[6:48] what god can do
[6:49] and take god at his word so it came to
[6:51] the place where the people were only
[6:53] looking for the supernatural signs only
[6:56] looking for the gifts in order to
[6:57] believe and that was not what god
[7:00] intended by the gifts and there's very
[7:02] tempting just to re-preach sunday
[7:04] morning but well i'm going to take this
[7:05] further
[7:06] these are two statements of one is from
[7:08] god keeps his word in 57 another was
[7:11] from the evidence of the resurrection in
[7:12] 58.
[7:14] i'm going to make reference to them and
[7:16] i want you to be careful to try not to
[7:17] assume too much but just recognize that
[7:20] brother branham's identifying this
[7:22] tendency of what might seem to be
[7:24] positive eventually getting to a point
[7:26] to where it's it's counterproductive i
[7:29] was going to maybe get into the law of
[7:30] diminishing returns and i realized that
[7:33] some of us probably hated economics too
[7:35] much in our studies to maybe dig into it
[7:38] but it's something i felt maybe even
[7:39] applicable
[7:41] in this context because there is a
[7:42] supernatural that's been done that's
[7:44] true
[7:45] but you're going wild with it
[7:49] and that interesting especially when we
[7:51] sometimes we say if i'd rather have a
[7:53] wildfire than no fire fire at all it's
[7:55] all right if it's if that's the a b
[7:57] multiple choice you could either choose
[7:59] between the two give me wildfire but i
[8:02] don't want to do what brother branham is
[8:03] saying here where supernatural's being
[8:05] done he says but you're going wild with
[8:07] it you're going on the deep end with it
[8:10] and some people may say glory to god i'm
[8:12] wild right
[8:14] and i'm going off the deep end i'm
[8:15] jumping in like you know like the a lot
[8:17] of the nominal christian songs anymore
[8:19] about hurricanes and recklessness and
[8:21] going in deep and everything right
[8:24] and painting a real big picture so we're
[8:26] thinking yeah that's what i'm doing i'm
[8:27] going wild i'm going off the deep end he
[8:29] says the devil's pushing you off with it
[8:32] and so then you're like wait a minute i
[8:34] thought you were going somewhere else
[8:35] with this brother branham he says you've
[8:37] got plum out of the bible now now again
[8:40] i'm just this is brother branham ign
[8:43] referencing to the move of the
[8:44] supernatural and then people getting
[8:46] wild with it going off the deep end in a
[8:48] bad way with it and it's the devil
[8:50] that's pushing you off into it
[8:53] why because the devil fights the
[8:54] wonderful truth of divine healing the
[8:55] devil can impersonate any gift there's
[8:57] just ways he tries to gum it up and
[8:59] confuse us he says you've got plum out
[9:01] of the bible now
[9:03] he says i believe in the supernatural
[9:06] and we ought to he says i believe in
[9:08] jesus christ i believe he's the same
[9:09] yesterday today and forever and does the
[9:11] same things that he did yesterday and
[9:13] will forever so we must believe in the
[9:16] supernatural right must be there must be
[9:19] there should not be any reluctance in
[9:21] our hearts to see god move in the
[9:23] supernatural for god to manifest himself
[9:25] because we believe in it but we realize
[9:27] there is a way that our faith not
[9:30] properly centered the devil can push us
[9:32] out of balance and people are going wild
[9:35] with it
[9:36] and often to the deep end by the devil's
[9:38] nudge
[9:40] then he makes this statement in the
[9:42] evidence of the resurrection we've come
[9:43] we've become interested in some emotion
[9:46] we become interested if we can dance if
[9:48] we can shout because i believe in it
[9:50] if we can speak with tongues i believe
[9:52] in it
[9:53] i believe in every bit of it so he's
[9:55] i i love his balance he's not just
[9:58] preaching against emotion he's not
[9:59] preaching against dancing or shouting he
[10:01] says i believe in it but we've become
[10:03] interested in that
[10:05] it says but if we have that and don't
[10:06] have that agonizing weeping broken up
[10:09] spirit god can never use it
[10:12] and in reading a lot of these statements
[10:15] these
[10:16] brother bradham is putting it in this
[10:18] context and i may be getting a little
[10:19] bit uh ahead of myself even in
[10:22] into the maybe another sermon later
[10:25] but when he's he's looking at divine
[10:26] healing and how it relates he's he
[10:28] usually brings us back to salvation of
[10:30] the soul is the most important that's
[10:33] the most important thing we shouldn't be
[10:34] laboring to see miracles of the healing
[10:37] of the body at the sake of not
[10:38] ministering to the needs of the souls
[10:40] that need to be saved and sealed by the
[10:43] holy ghost
[10:44] and and i would think that we as message
[10:46] believers have a tremendous balance in
[10:48] that often in our churches we're
[10:50] preaching to uh people who've had that
[10:52] experience and they're not just hanging
[10:54] out for prayer lines and things like
[10:56] that uh and so i wouldn't want to just
[10:58] lean too far into this but he is wanting
[11:00] us he's wanting us to see that there's
[11:02] something where you get so fixated on
[11:03] the gifts and the movement of the spirit
[11:05] that other things are left undone
[11:08] and he's talking about this agonizing
[11:09] this week this weeping
[11:11] and he says them things are good
[11:14] but we've got to have the other to go
[11:16] with it
[11:17] we've left off
[11:19] the main thing and gone for secondary
[11:22] and you can never major on a minor so
[11:24] we've left off the main thing and gone
[11:26] for something secondary and you can
[11:27] never major on a minor we know that even
[11:29] in our own meetings our own meetings
[11:32] have gone too much to the place it's too
[11:35] much on divine healing instead of
[11:37] healing of the soul
[11:39] this is brother bam's assessment of his
[11:40] own meetings if you want to say he's
[11:42] just he's bringing in the the
[11:43] pentecostals that's fine but you'll find
[11:45] in other places what brother brahms
[11:47] lamenting about his own emphasis on the
[11:49] signs and wonders and miracles he says
[11:51] even in our own meetings we've gone too
[11:53] much to the place where it's on divine
[11:55] healing
[11:56] instead of the healing of the soul and i
[11:58] think it's still relevant today no
[12:00] matter how far that we've gone in the
[12:01] word of god it's still relevant today
[12:04] that we're mindful that there's souls
[12:05] that need to be saved amen
[12:07] no matter how much filled with the holy
[12:09] ghost you are and no matter how much
[12:11] filled the holy ghost your spouse is if
[12:12] you have children they still must be
[12:15] born again and so there must always be a
[12:17] gospel that's calling the sinner to
[12:19] repentance and i believe this message is
[12:22] the way of salvation and and he's saying
[12:24] we got to be careful that even in our
[12:26] own meetings that not too much emphasis
[12:28] is placed upon divine healing instead of
[12:30] healing of the soul and he's saying
[12:31] because you can't major on a minor
[12:35] now in the sermon the queen of sheba
[12:37] this is going to touch on the same
[12:39] thought but it's going to also bring in
[12:41] kind of this absolute concreteness of
[12:43] divine healing he says now in these
[12:45] meetings we do not have what we call
[12:46] major on divine healing because divine
[12:49] healing is a minor and you can never
[12:51] major on a minor divine healing is just
[12:53] something that god added to the church
[12:56] and no one can preach salvation of the
[12:58] soul without preaching divine healing
[13:00] for the body
[13:02] this is where we you can draw that
[13:04] thought from where i said that
[13:06] healing of the body is a consequence or
[13:08] a product of purchasing your salvation
[13:10] listen how he describes this it's just
[13:12] like if an animal had me by the side
[13:14] here and was just cutting my side out
[13:15] with his paws there's no need of
[13:17] chopping off his foot or his paw that is
[13:19] god in my side just knock him in the
[13:22] head it kills the whole animal i know
[13:24] it's pretty brutal and we might get
[13:26] censored by youtube
[13:28] but he says well that's the way christ
[13:30] did when he died for sin
[13:33] he killed every attribute of sin
[13:36] he killed the whole thing and before we
[13:38] had any sin we had no sickness sickness
[13:40] is an attribute of sin without sin they
[13:42] had no sickness and he's saying that if
[13:44] you deal with sin you've dealt with
[13:46] sickness you've killed the whole animal
[13:47] the whole beast and so it took care of
[13:49] the the sickness of your body when he
[13:51] took care of the sin question and when
[13:53] sickness is a result of sin and you
[13:54] cannot deal with sin without dealing
[13:55] with sickness he was wounded for our
[13:57] transgressions with his stripes we are
[13:59] healed
[14:00] so when you stop the sin question you
[14:02] also affect the sick question
[14:05] all of it is taken care of together
[14:08] and that's why christ died a full man a
[14:10] full death a full resurrection for a
[14:11] full church for a full gospel that's
[14:13] right
[14:14] therefore it all goes together
[14:17] he says you say well then brother
[14:19] branham your ministry is noted as divine
[14:22] healing because i might say man the most
[14:23] outstanding thing in your ministry is
[14:25] the divine healing
[14:27] sure certainly divine healing attracts
[14:30] about 85 percent of jesus's ministry was
[14:33] divine healing so catch that divine
[14:34] healing attracts
[14:36] 85 percent of jesus minister was divine
[14:38] healing did you know that the late dr f
[14:40] f bosworth used to say you never show
[14:42] the fish the hook you show them the bait
[14:44] he grabs the bait and he's got the hook
[14:46] so that's the way it is people come to
[14:48] see the power and the miracles of god
[14:51] and when they see that
[14:53] actually god catches them with the hooks
[14:55] and the jaw right there because they
[14:57] know that there's something real
[15:00] puts in a very a very beautiful light
[15:02] that god uses signs wonders supernatural
[15:05] in order to catch the people's attention
[15:07] divine healing attracts people come and
[15:09] they see the power of god and the
[15:12] miracles of god and when they see that
[15:14] they know there's something beyond
[15:16] themselves
[15:17] you know this is this is not normal this
[15:20] is not natural
[15:21] and this is just when the supernatural
[15:23] begins to move man whether it manifest
[15:25] in worship or praise or signs and
[15:28] wonders and miracles there's a point
[15:29] where you begin to realize there's
[15:31] something beyond there's something
[15:32] supernatural and i'm sure many of you
[15:34] can recall even as children or maybe a
[15:36] young person when you first begin to
[15:38] feel the presence of god you know this
[15:39] is beyond myself this is beyond natural
[15:42] i know there's something real beyond the
[15:45] flesh
[15:46] so in the way that brother brown was put
[15:48] in it now i still want you to remember
[15:50] the idea that uh brother brahms says you
[15:53] can get wild with this you can go too
[15:54] far you can go off the deep end you can
[15:56] get too caught up in emotion you begin
[15:58] to make the meetings all about divine
[16:00] healing and not so much the soul
[16:02] but so now we're kind of stepping back
[16:04] and showing
[16:06] that divine healing is necessary
[16:08] because it demonstrates something beyond
[16:10] the ability of man it is supernatural
[16:13] and so when that happens you know well
[16:15] man cannot do this is something only god
[16:17] can do and it gets someone's attention
[16:20] and they're challenged they then are
[16:22] facing the the choice should i do i
[16:24] believe in god do i accept the
[16:26] supernatural do i begin to open myself
[16:29] up to accept this one that can do the
[16:31] things that no man can do or do i want
[16:34] to just stay the way i am and so the
[16:36] individuals are confronted by the
[16:38] supernatural
[16:39] uh through divine healing and these
[16:41] manifestations
[16:43] and we're talking about just the center
[16:44] the the make-believer the the nominal
[16:46] person that these are ways of getting
[16:48] their attention now i'm going to be
[16:50] looking at john chapter six so you can
[16:52] if you want to start turning there uh
[16:54] where we were in our text we'll still
[16:55] read a few other scriptures and quotes
[16:57] but i want you to start thinking about
[17:00] uh what we read there in john chapter
[17:02] six and kind of read just in the middle
[17:04] and i'm going to start a little bit
[17:05] before that
[17:06] in john chapter 6
[17:09] the
[17:09] at the very very beginning it says in
[17:11] verse 2 and a great multitude followed
[17:14] him
[17:15] because they saw his miracles which he
[17:17] did on them that were diseased and so we
[17:20] know that just before he had healed it
[17:22] to pulled bethesda healed the nobleman's
[17:23] son
[17:24] and so word is going abroad that jesus
[17:26] christ this jesus of nazareth this man
[17:29] of galilee
[17:30] is praying for the sick he's teaching
[17:33] and things are happening and people are
[17:34] being delivered of their diseases and
[17:37] this is the phrase it says a great
[17:39] multitude there's many that are
[17:40] following because because because they
[17:44] are following because they saw miracles
[17:45] which he did
[17:46] they are following because of the divine
[17:49] healing so he amassed quite a large
[17:50] following because of the miracle of
[17:53] divine healing that was following him
[17:56] and the sermon conferences with god
[17:57] brother man says now we do not try to
[17:59] say that we make divine healing here a
[18:01] major because divine healing is a minor
[18:04] and you can never major on a minor but
[18:06] we believe that jesus christ ministry 86
[18:09] of it was divine healing so it's already
[18:10] gone up a percent
[18:12] and in catching the people's attention
[18:14] by divine healing brought the
[18:15] realization that he was god
[18:20] this is what's taking place he says
[18:22] that there's a great multitude fun
[18:24] because they saw his miracles that he
[18:25] did on that they were diseased and
[18:28] divine healing is to catch the people's
[18:30] attention
[18:31] to bring the realization that this is
[18:34] god in the flesh of his son this is god
[18:36] manifesting himself as a messiah to the
[18:38] people that was the purpose of doing the
[18:41] supernatural
[18:42] because it was related to an attribute
[18:44] of god i am the lord that healeth all
[18:46] thy diseases
[18:48] it was to catch their attention
[18:50] in john chapter 10 verses 37
[18:53] and to 38
[18:55] i recognize a typo here that should be
[18:57] 38 not 28. might be trying to figure out
[18:59] which version of the bible am i reading
[19:01] in
[19:02] kind of like a hybrid english hebrew
[19:04] bible where you kind of go backwards
[19:06] it says if i do not the works of my
[19:08] father believe me not but if i do
[19:11] th though but if i do though you believe
[19:14] not me
[19:16] believe the works
[19:17] that you may know and believe that the
[19:19] father is in me and i in him we were
[19:21] reading the bible last night and eliot
[19:23] said that the bible has a way of saying
[19:25] things sometimes that you could say in
[19:27] much fewer words
[19:29] and this may be one of those instances
[19:31] if i do not the works of my father
[19:32] believe me not but if i do though you
[19:34] believe not me believe the works that
[19:36] you may know and believe that the father
[19:38] is in me and i in him
[19:39] he said if you can't take my word for it
[19:42] believe the works
[19:44] if you're not going to believe me when i
[19:46] tell you that the father is in me when i
[19:47] demonstrate something that should that
[19:49] could only be done by god then you ought
[19:51] to believe me said if you can't take my
[19:53] word for it which is the supreme way the
[19:55] original way the way that god wants it
[19:56] to be he's saying believe me because the
[19:59] works that are following demonstrate
[20:01] what i've just told you to be
[20:04] says it again in john 14 11 believe me
[20:06] that i am in the father and the father
[20:08] and me or else believe me for the very
[20:10] work's sake
[20:13] now this is uh to me it's a very
[20:14] profound uh
[20:16] profound scriptures because it's showing
[20:19] this
[20:20] uh the grace of god to where he sends
[20:23] his son
[20:24] and he is the messiah
[20:26] i think there's a song that uh i think
[20:28] brother rodney griffin wrote even if he
[20:30] never came and did another miracle jesus
[20:32] would still be god right if he never
[20:34] performed one miracle he still jesus
[20:36] would have still been the messiah
[20:38] and and so
[20:40] he's not demonstrating any signs and he
[20:42] wonders any miracles then he still would
[20:44] be who he was but god in his grace
[20:47] because he wants people to believe is
[20:49] declaring his presence in the son doing
[20:51] things that he said he would do
[20:54] by prophecy by promise by the by the old
[20:56] testament prophets and he's saying
[20:58] believe me when i tell you that the
[21:00] fathers and me and i and in him and if
[21:02] you can't just take my word for it
[21:04] believe me for the very work's sake that
[21:06] god is doing through me
[21:09] i i don't have the statement in front of
[21:10] me but i just want to make reference to
[21:12] it
[21:13] brother adam in the church book says
[21:15] jesus never did emphasize his works over
[21:18] the word
[21:19] i may be kind of losing the exact
[21:21] phrasing of it but jesus is first saying
[21:25] i am it speaks the word and stands by it
[21:28] but then is pointing out that god is
[21:30] doing demonstrating certain things that
[21:32] if you can't just believe my word
[21:33] believe the works so they're working
[21:35] together
[21:36] but he's not putting the emphasis on the
[21:38] works he's putting it on the word and
[21:41] giving a dispensation of grace to
[21:42] receive him by his works
[21:44] and so believe the works if you can't
[21:46] believe the word because the works are
[21:47] to back up what he was already saying
[21:50] now in john chapter 6 we know that
[21:52] thousands uh had begin to follow him
[21:55] when it says a great
[21:56] multitude we know by virtue of the
[21:58] miracles that are performed in john
[22:00] chapter 6
[22:02] that thousands had come
[22:04] because of the divine healing
[22:06] because of the miracles they were
[22:07] attracted
[22:09] this is the question i want to ask
[22:11] what impact were the miracles having
[22:14] as they witnessed them
[22:16] where were they ending up at the end of
[22:18] the day what was what was the final
[22:20] outcome and result as they witnessed
[22:21] this tremendous these supernatural
[22:23] instances
[22:24] and in john chapter six verse five this
[22:26] is how we know thousands uh were coming
[22:28] he says when jesus then lifted up his
[22:30] eyes and saw a great company con unto
[22:32] him he saith unto philip when shall we
[22:34] buy bread that these may eat we continue
[22:36] to read and jesus feeds over five
[22:38] thousand
[22:39] uh with five barley loaves and just two
[22:41] small fish pickled or dried fish
[22:44] and uh when they're done there's
[22:45] leftovers to fill 12 baskets
[22:48] and we went through these very these
[22:50] some of these exact scriptures when we
[22:52] ministered last year i know you remember
[22:54] exactly the date march something 2021
[22:57] you you don't even have to flip back in
[22:59] your notes you remember it so well on
[23:00] being hungry or hungry and and asking
[23:03] the question looking at the spiritual
[23:04] hunger that we all should have
[23:06] and so he he feeds 5 000 has leftovers
[23:10] to spare
[23:11] and because of this
[23:13] uh this great miracle there's already a
[23:15] great multitude following because the
[23:16] loaves and fishes are because of the
[23:18] miracles the divine healing now he does
[23:20] something that is supernatural and again
[23:22] i would say if you can't believe me when
[23:24] i tell you i'm the son of god
[23:26] maybe you should believe me when i just
[23:28] multiplied
[23:29] uh 12 you know these five loaves and two
[23:32] small fish enough to feed five thousand
[23:34] just the men and then the rest and all
[23:36] these leftovers so in verses 22 and 24
[23:39] as we have already read it these come
[23:41] they come try to seek him and follow
[23:43] find out where he was they had been
[23:45] there when these miracles were wrought
[23:48] and they can't find him anymore and they
[23:49] didn't see him leave and they saw this
[23:51] this back and forth where they realized
[23:52] well where's jesus and the people are
[23:54] coming back to that place where the
[23:56] bread was broke looking for jesus and
[23:58] then seeing that he is gone they they go
[24:01] now across the sea to find jesus and
[24:04] they're seeking jesus
[24:06] in verse 25 and when they found him on
[24:08] the other side of the sea they said unto
[24:09] him rabbi this is a word of respect
[24:13] teacher rabbi master in a sense that
[24:15] they're
[24:16] they're showing them reverence and
[24:17] respect because they recognize the
[24:18] things that he's doing he says when
[24:20] cometh thou hithert they ask
[24:22] jesus answered them and said
[24:25] verily verily i say unto you ye seek me
[24:28] not because you saw the miracles but
[24:30] because you did eat of the loaves and
[24:32] were filled
[24:36] nice to see you too right
[24:38] what are you doing here and they're
[24:39] saying hey jesus what's going on you
[24:41] know que pasa and he's like you know
[24:44] you're not looking for me because you
[24:45] you really want us you know you really
[24:47] have saw the what's taking place you
[24:50] seek me not because you saw the miracles
[24:52] again this is a peculiar phrase because
[24:55] they saw the miracles but they didn't
[24:57] really see the miracles
[24:59] you're seeking me which we would think
[25:01] would be good and it is good but you're
[25:03] not seeking me because the miracles have
[25:06] truly attracted you but you're seeking
[25:08] me because you ate of the bread and it
[25:11] satisfied you
[25:13] so there was something shallow about
[25:15] their search they're seeing the
[25:16] supernatural they're seeing things that
[25:19] you and i will never see in our lifetime
[25:20] that many people fed off of two loaves
[25:22] and five loaves and two small fish and
[25:24] so this is something very very
[25:26] supernatural but the miracles went no
[25:28] deeper than the temporary satisfaction
[25:31] of their appetite
[25:33] it went no different it went no further
[25:36] because after that after their stomachs
[25:38] were hungry again they were still
[25:40] seeking this bread and they wanted this
[25:41] bread that was multiplied and so he's
[25:43] saying that they're what been awakened
[25:46] inside of them is just temporary that as
[25:48] soon as they're hungry again for natural
[25:50] bread they were looking for jesus and
[25:52] the same way that's exactly what healing
[25:55] is healing is temporal
[25:58] it's only going to last as long until
[25:59] you get sick again and it's only going
[26:01] to last until you die
[26:03] these healings are only temporary in
[26:05] this body because you can get healed in
[26:07] your body only to get sick at the very
[26:09] same thing or sick of something else so
[26:11] when they came looking for him they
[26:13] wanted the bread to feed the body which
[26:16] was something temporary in the same way
[26:18] that some people are just coming looking
[26:20] to christ for the temporary
[26:21] manifestations of the gifts and the
[26:23] temporary outpouring of the holy ghost
[26:26] because of what it can do to their body
[26:28] into their spirit
[26:30] and so jesus is actually identifying
[26:32] that they did not understand the
[26:34] supernatural significance or the reason
[26:37] for the miracles
[26:40] it was a signpost it was a sign that was
[26:42] being given but they didn't recognize
[26:44] what it was pointing to they were never
[26:46] at this moment they're not fully seeing
[26:49] the miracles for what they were for
[26:53] believe me for my word's sake but if you
[26:55] can't believe me for my words like
[26:57] believe me
[26:59] for my work's sake not if you can't
[27:01] believe me believe my works
[27:04] right it wasn't this it wasn't just
[27:05] trying to say well i mean at least you
[27:07] come for the bread right well at least
[27:08] you come for this at least you come for
[27:10] that no he wanted them to believe
[27:12] and so they sought him because the
[27:14] miracles but they sought him for the
[27:16] miracles only
[27:19] they're seeking them for the because of
[27:20] the miracles but then they were only
[27:22] seeking the miracles
[27:24] continuing in verse 27
[27:27] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[27:29] but for the meat which is dearth under
[27:30] everlasting life which the son of man
[27:32] shall give unto you for him hath god the
[27:34] father sealed this is jesus now opening
[27:37] the word
[27:39] they come wanting more bread more
[27:40] miracles more signs more wonders well
[27:42] he's not going to give them what they're
[27:44] looking for because he's already given
[27:46] them a sign and now he's saying that you
[27:49] ought not to labor for the temporary
[27:51] things just don't labor for signs and
[27:52] wonders and gifts but you should labor
[27:54] for the word you should labor for that
[27:56] which
[27:57] can transform you
[28:00] and there's uh it provokes dialogue then
[28:03] they said to him what shall we do that
[28:04] we might work the works of god
[28:07] jesus answered and said to them
[28:09] this is the work of god that you believe
[28:12] on him whom he hath sent
[28:13] he's not letting up
[28:15] he's coming right back to it he says
[28:17] they said what can we do that we might
[28:18] work the mighty works of god he's saying
[28:21] the work of god when god has actually
[28:24] done a work in you you believe
[28:28] this is the work of god that you believe
[28:30] on him whom he had sent here's jesus
[28:31] christ standing there the father has
[28:33] sent me and i am speaking unto you and
[28:37] the word it would be effective in your
[28:39] heart even the signs and wonders and
[28:40] miracles would be effective in your
[28:41] heart if you had believed me because
[28:44] that's the work of god in there what can
[28:45] we do to work the mighty works of god
[28:47] well you haven't even started yet
[28:49] because god's not working even in you to
[28:51] believe me
[28:54] quite a statement
[28:56] they respond
[28:58] they said therefore unto him
[29:00] what signs show us thou then
[29:03] that we may see and believe thee
[29:05] what dost thou work
[29:08] and
[29:13] hadn't already been enough
[29:15] i mean
[29:16] they're following because of the
[29:17] miracles right
[29:19] they're falling because hey these guys
[29:20] are being healed he's cashing out
[29:22] diseases he just multiplied two loaves
[29:24] of five why'd i keep saying two loaves
[29:26] five loaves of bread and and two fish
[29:29] and he's done that and they're like and
[29:31] he said you should believe me like well
[29:32] what are you gonna do
[29:34] you know
[29:35] i mean i'm open to the idea i mean
[29:38] i'm not completely skeptical and i can
[29:41] be convinced convince me jesus
[29:44] and they know exactly what they're
[29:46] talking about because he just performed
[29:47] this miracle with two plus three loaves
[29:49] of bread and he says our fathers did eat
[29:52] man in the desert and it is written he
[29:53] gave them bread from heaven to eat
[29:57] this is they said they know exactly what
[29:59] they're thinking about
[30:01] but they only had an appetite for the
[30:03] miracles not for christ
[30:06] and they had an appetite for the
[30:07] miracles because what it could do to the
[30:08] body what it could do to the bottom line
[30:10] to think that you could have you could
[30:12] be hanging out with somebody that
[30:14] whenever you're hungry they can take
[30:15] whatever peter brought and feed
[30:17] everybody else
[30:18] and you don't ever need to bring lunch
[30:20] to work
[30:24] they only had an appetite for the
[30:25] miracles not for the miracle worker
[30:28] our fat fathers ate man in the desert
[30:30] and it's written he gave them bread from
[30:32] heaven to eat so why don't you when you
[30:34] pull it down to this guy why don't you
[30:35] feed us
[30:36] verse
[30:37] verse 32 so we continued then jesus said
[30:40] to them verily verily i send you moses
[30:42] gave you not that bread from heaven
[30:45] but my father giveth you the true bread
[30:47] from heaven
[30:48] for the bread of god which is he
[30:51] which cometh down from heaven and giveth
[30:53] life unto the world so truly it wasn't
[30:56] moses that gave
[30:59] the bread it was god that sent it down
[31:00] from heaven but now he's talking about
[31:02] the true bread of heaven the bread of
[31:04] god which is he
[31:06] it's christ the word which cometh down
[31:08] from heaven and giveth life unto
[31:10] the world
[31:13] now
[31:16] consider just how contradictory this was
[31:19] to
[31:20] uh
[31:21] their religious minds
[31:26] he is saying that there is a living
[31:28] bread of life for the bread of god which
[31:30] is he which comes from heaven and giveth
[31:32] life unto the world there is a bread of
[31:34] life that is more necessary than just
[31:37] the temporal bread
[31:38] that even your fathers ate in the
[31:40] wilderness
[31:41] more necessary than just the bread that
[31:43] you ate the day before
[31:45] there there's a life that's more
[31:47] necessary than the temporary healings
[31:49] the temporary hunger
[31:51] and their response is not again in line
[31:55] with what jesus is trying to provoke
[31:56] because in verse 34 they said in him
[31:58] lord evermore give us this bread
[32:01] and when they say that they're not
[32:03] desiring christ who had come down from
[32:06] heaven who was that bread so it wasn't
[32:08] like it clicked
[32:09] right it wasn't like they said wait a
[32:12] minute
[32:13] this is he
[32:15] he speaks to us he is the one uh they're
[32:17] they're not desiring they're not being
[32:19] awakened to the true messiah because all
[32:21] their traditions and we could get into a
[32:23] lot of how these traditions are
[32:24] impacting them at this very moment but
[32:26] all their traditions had veiled them
[32:28] from seeing him
[32:30] the jews believed the messiah would come
[32:31] and when he would come he would serve
[32:33] the best wine
[32:35] they believed it they believed he would
[32:37] have the best wine and the best bread
[32:39] naturally
[32:40] and so there's a lot of reasons why they
[32:42] were looking forward to the messiah they
[32:43] would have the best wine and the best
[32:44] bread and so if he's the messiah then
[32:48] they're saying now's your time to put up
[32:50] buddy
[32:51] we've already heard that you turned the
[32:52] water into wine we saw what you did with
[32:54] the loaves the day before now you show
[32:57] us that you're the messiah because the
[32:58] messiah when he comes he's going to set
[33:00] up a natural kingdom on earth and all
[33:02] the gentiles are going to come to it
[33:03] there's going to be peace throughout all
[33:05] the world and you're going to rule and
[33:07] reign the messiah is going to be a
[33:08] natural king and he is going to have the
[33:10] best bread and the best wine
[33:13] and so they wanted was a perpetual
[33:15] natural food
[33:17] they weren't asking for the bread from
[33:19] heaven that supernatural that gives life
[33:21] unto the world the bread that jesus is
[33:23] alluding to but when they said evermore
[33:25] lord give us this bread they wanted it
[33:28] to eat just like they had the day before
[33:32] and he says in verse 35 and this is kind
[33:34] of what instigates
[33:36] their animus towards them and jesus said
[33:38] unto him i am the bread of life
[33:41] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[33:43] and he that believeth on me shall never
[33:45] thirst
[33:46] he's not given in
[33:48] jesus didn't say you know what fine
[33:50] andrew come here let me have your little
[33:52] pouch of bread there he's not giving in
[33:55] he's still he
[33:56] had come to a tipping point
[33:58] come to a point where he knew i've done
[34:00] enough and you've seen enough even just
[34:02] this early on
[34:03] the miracles and signs and wonders that
[34:05] had been done he's saying i've got to
[34:07] and he's doing that which the father
[34:08] shows them i've got to lay in the word
[34:10] now i've got to stand by what i am
[34:12] there's been enough done already
[34:14] secondarily to back up what i'm trying
[34:17] to say that i'm the son of god so now
[34:18] he's wanting them not to seek after the
[34:21] bread to not seek after the miracles but
[34:23] to seek after him so he's saying just as
[34:25] that bread was given that fed you i am
[34:28] that bread that will satisfy you
[34:30] forevermore
[34:31] you eat you come to me you'll never
[34:33] hunger if you believe in me you'll never
[34:35] thirst
[34:36] and in verse 41 the jews then murmured
[34:38] at him
[34:39] notice the the negativity and the angle
[34:42] they murdered him because he said i am
[34:44] the bread which come down from heaven
[34:46] and they said is not this jesus the son
[34:49] of joseph whose father and mother we
[34:51] know
[34:52] how is it then that he saith i come down
[34:54] from heaven.
[34:56] are these the same people
[34:58] earlier i mean were some of them from
[35:00] verse two great multitude follows
[35:02] because of the miracles he did on them
[35:03] that were diseased are are not these the
[35:06] ones of the same thousands
[35:09] who were there when he multiplied the
[35:11] two plus three loaves and the two fishes
[35:13] were they not there when it happened
[35:16] weren't they not there and why didn't
[35:18] they say
[35:19] what's joseph's son doing
[35:22] right they didn't say it when he was
[35:24] multiplying stuff
[35:26] but
[35:27] and not that they wouldn't have said it
[35:28] elsewhere they could have said it but
[35:29] it's in this moment they're beginning to
[35:31] forget these are the same people that
[35:33] saw miracles were seeking after him and
[35:36] now when he starts speaking a certain
[35:37] way and he's sticking by what his
[35:39] calling is what is what the word is
[35:41] they're starting to say well you know
[35:44] he's really just a man and what about
[35:46] joseph and they're trying to allude to
[35:48] joseph his father and mother and the
[35:50] things they know about him and all the
[35:52] rumors that may be true and he's trying
[35:54] to say he came down from heaven
[35:56] and how quickly how quickly they turned
[35:59] on him
[35:59] when he wouldn't get him a little non
[36:01] right
[36:03] verse 51 i'm going to start counting
[36:06] your nices and they say i'm up to 18
[36:08] nicest today like this is a record on a
[36:10] wednesday night
[36:13] in verse 51 i'm just skipping now
[36:15] john chapter 6
[36:17] 51-53
[36:18] he's just
[36:20] he's not backing down i'm the living
[36:21] bread which come down from heaven if any
[36:23] man eat of this bread he shall live
[36:25] forever and the bread that i will give
[36:27] is my flesh which i will give for the
[36:29] life of the world now he says this after
[36:32] they start murmuring that he says he's
[36:35] he's the bread that comes down out of
[36:37] heaven and jesus didn't say you know
[36:39] what i know that sounds confusing
[36:42] and i know it's really easy to
[36:43] misunderstand me so let me explain
[36:45] myself i'm sorry that you took it that
[36:47] way
[36:48] let's kind of break this down into the
[36:49] semantics but he says no i am the living
[36:51] bread of life come out of him if you eat
[36:53] this bread you'll live forever
[36:56] and the bread that i give is my flesh
[36:59] he's aggravating it
[37:01] so then it says in verse 53 the jews
[37:04] therefore strove among them saying
[37:06] saying and then among themselves saying
[37:08] how can this man give us his flesh to
[37:10] eat
[37:13] and finally jesus backed off i know that
[37:15] seems a little dramatic i'm sorry let me
[37:17] explain myself then jesus said to them
[37:19] verily verily i say unto you except you
[37:21] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[37:23] drink his blood you have no life in you
[37:28] wow how quickly the impression of the
[37:30] supernatural had left their minds
[37:34] a multitudes following because the sick
[37:36] are healed then they see another miracle
[37:39] which is supernatural demonstrative and
[37:43] this is not slight of hand
[37:46] and uh
[37:47] and he and he performs this miracle
[37:50] and it caused them to want to seek after
[37:53] him but at the very beginning of this
[37:55] part of the story at the very time on
[37:57] this next day jesus is already calling
[38:00] them out you're just wanting more
[38:02] miracles
[38:04] you have experienced and benefited by
[38:07] the miracles but you haven't really seen
[38:09] what they're all about and so when he
[38:11] starts trying to back come into the word
[38:13] now to say all of this was done that you
[38:15] might believe what i'm about to tell you
[38:17] then unless you eat this bread and drink
[38:18] this blood you'll have no part of me
[38:20] unless you eat the flesh of the son of
[38:21] man and drink his blood you have no life
[38:23] in you and that was the payoff of the
[38:25] miracles that was the moment when they
[38:27] would have all succeeded but it was so
[38:29] quick it was like
[38:30] all those things were gone and they're
[38:31] now striving oh my goodness this man's
[38:34] saying this this man saying that when
[38:36] they ought to have said
[38:39] wow
[38:41] think about what he has done
[38:43] think about these
[38:44] miracles the minor had led them to the
[38:47] major
[38:49] but they weren't able to accept it
[38:52] it was right there in front of them
[38:54] and they weren't able to accept it
[38:57] so we know in the infamous john 6 66
[39:01] from that time many of his disciples
[39:03] went back
[39:04] and walked no more with them
[39:07] that was it
[39:09] many of his
[39:10] disciples went back
[39:12] these disciples were ones that would
[39:14] have seen the divine healing
[39:17] they would have seen signs wonders
[39:18] discernments
[39:21] and all of those should have been
[39:22] building confidence
[39:25] building confidence for the moment when
[39:28] he would he would open up the word which
[39:30] is was already spoken uh it would backed
[39:33] up what was said of the messiah this
[39:34] would have convinced them this is the
[39:35] messiah this was god's trajectory this
[39:38] is how god was working he was trying to
[39:39] build them to a place to where they
[39:40] would see yes you are the very messiah
[39:44] is that not what happened to the woman
[39:45] at the well
[39:48] that he performed a wonder and was laid
[39:50] in the word and it brought her to christ
[39:52] it's not it's not the one who's the very
[39:54] messiah who told me the things that i've
[39:56] ever done but yet here's the opposite
[39:58] impact signs wonders miracles but when
[40:01] the payoff was to come for all that it's
[40:03] the very word that caused them to walk
[40:04] away
[40:06] if jesus had not if he had not
[40:08] stigmatized it with the word
[40:10] they might have been happy
[40:12] to follow
[40:13] now i don't want you stop giving me
[40:15] nices brother loyal
[40:16] so don't sit on me now i was
[40:19] i was just acknowledging them
[40:21] nice
[40:23] in investments brother brahm touches on
[40:24] so many different ones that we could use
[40:27] so many ones we could use on this
[40:29] because aren't we all familiar with this
[40:30] verse and many of his disciples walked
[40:33] away what was he doing getting into the
[40:34] word of his ministry brother man
[40:35] identifies it so plainly he said but one
[40:38] day god changed that ministry in him for
[40:40] miracles to the teaching of the word
[40:42] surely you could read between the lines
[40:44] look at the date
[40:46] it's getting it's coming he knows this
[40:48] is soon upon him when these seals are
[40:50] going to be open surely you could read
[40:52] between the lines he was already talking
[40:53] about how to change his ministry coming
[40:55] into something
[40:56] the program coming up a step higher he
[40:58] was very very conscious of this he says
[41:00] one day that ministry changed from
[41:02] miracles to the teaching of the word
[41:04] surely you could read between the lines
[41:06] and it's not that from this moment on
[41:08] jesus never performed another miracle
[41:10] but it was kind of that trajectory where
[41:11] this is building to this
[41:14] now the pattern can repeat itself as it
[41:16] often did in brother brown's ministries
[41:17] after the seals you'll find he'd start a
[41:19] series in tulsa or topeka or tampa and
[41:21] he's building building to this climax
[41:23] getting everybody on the same page what
[41:25] they're looking for what to expect in
[41:26] this last day how did he promise he
[41:28] would reveal himself so that whenever he
[41:30] would give a sign that would kind of be
[41:31] the aha moment i get it wow this is
[41:34] amazing right the revelation is to
[41:37] strike he says surely you could read
[41:38] between the lines he says you're not
[41:40] that blind
[41:44] and he says notice as soon as god
[41:45] changed his ministry from his miracles
[41:47] his miracles went on but not like that
[41:50] he began to tell them the straight
[41:52] scripture truth and where they were
[41:54] standing
[41:56] the crowd walked away from him said this
[41:57] is a hard saying
[41:59] what happened the 70 that was followed
[42:01] him he ordained they walked away too
[42:03] said who can understand a thing like
[42:05] this that's all against everything we
[42:07] was ever taught
[42:13] surely
[42:14] it ought to have been building to where
[42:15] they could have accepted him
[42:17] but it didn't and go awake jesus he said
[42:19] then we find out that they turned their
[42:21] backs and walked with him
[42:22] no more
[42:24] i'm gonna skip a little bit he says he
[42:26] gave them some strong doctrine
[42:28] his healing days were just about over he
[42:31] didn't care wasn't going to heal too
[42:33] much more he's going to tell them about
[42:36] something that was better
[42:39] i love that
[42:40] he was going to tell them about
[42:42] something that was better
[42:45] think of all i think of the emphasis we
[42:47] find often after the opening of the
[42:49] seals we've got something better we've
[42:51] got something more we've got something
[42:52] higher we've got something greater he
[42:54] says
[42:55] a whole new land a whole new field he
[42:57] says i'm going to tell him about
[42:58] something better he began to tell them
[43:00] that he was there revealed to them who
[43:03] he actually was
[43:06] so it wasn't just oh signs wonders
[43:08] miracles signs wonders miracles it was
[43:10] now he wanted himself to be revealed
[43:13] he wanted to reveal himself who he was
[43:15] uh
[43:16] to them what he was to be to them and
[43:18] it's the same in this last days god
[43:20] wants to reveal himself to you who he is
[43:23] the revealed word your mate
[43:25] he wants to reveal himself to you and
[43:27] god and his grace and god and his mercy
[43:30] will manifest himself to the movement of
[43:32] the spirit signs wonder wonders and
[43:34] miracles all sorts of things but at the
[43:36] end of the day he wants you
[43:38] he wants to reveal himself personally to
[43:40] you
[43:41] who he is in this hour and this time and
[43:43] he says so away they went
[43:46] why because he wasn't entertaining them
[43:48] with miracles anymore
[43:56] and the sermon sir we would see jesus
[44:01] i trust that this is making
[44:03] making sense to you kind of building in
[44:04] the right way
[44:06] he says now divine healing is not all
[44:08] the message
[44:09] jesus put i think they claimed about 80
[44:12] so now he's lost six
[44:13] about 80 of his ministry was on divine
[44:16] healing
[44:17] but as a late brother bosworth many of
[44:19] you know brother f f bosworth a godly
[44:21] saint man he used to say that divine
[44:24] healing is just like the bait on the
[44:25] hook
[44:26] you never show the fish the hook you
[44:28] show him the bait
[44:29] and so divine healing is a minor
[44:33] you can never major on a minor
[44:35] but it leads to the major
[44:37] isn't that beautiful
[44:39] you can never major on a minor
[44:41] but it leads to the major
[44:43] that's what it's supposed to do
[44:45] it's to lead you to the major
[44:48] if the minor begins to have so much
[44:50] attention where to that becomes the
[44:52] major
[44:53] you can't major on a minor
[44:56] there's there's something being lost
[44:57] even in the minor there's a devaluing
[45:00] there's something that's unwinding and
[45:02] the people in their hearts in john
[45:03] chapter 6 jesus kind of calls it out
[45:05] you're seeking me not because you're
[45:06] recognizing this miracle and this sign
[45:09] as being indicative of christ the
[45:11] messiah being amongst you but you're
[45:13] doing it only because you love how the
[45:16] secondary work or that miracle you love
[45:18] how it makes you feel
[45:22] it to me it hearkens back to brother
[45:24] branham saying you know the supernatural
[45:26] is being done but you're going wild with
[45:28] it or you're going leading too much to
[45:29] emotion and the meetings get too much
[45:31] words there's too much placed on divine
[45:33] healing instead of the healing of the
[45:34] soul jesus said here's a bread you can
[45:36] eat and never die
[45:39] and they would just as soon get healed
[45:41] of a bad headache or a bad diagnosis
[45:46] but he says the divine healing is a
[45:48] minor
[45:50] and says and you can never major on a
[45:52] minor
[45:54] when i start and again this is just
[45:56] i believe a necessary foundation before
[45:59] we start to emphasize
[46:00] taking time to really highlight divine
[46:02] healing
[46:03] i haven't done i haven't got there yet
[46:05] i don't know if that's a success or
[46:07] failure on my part
[46:08] but i've just it it just so impressed
[46:10] only before we start really
[46:13] teaching in the word of god in such a
[46:15] way to where people can experience the
[46:17] healing power of god's word
[46:19] that i wanted this to be the emphasis i
[46:21] want this to be our foundation and we're
[46:23] entering the record as a church that if
[46:25] god ever as we invite god to move in
[46:28] powerful ways amongst us and to manifest
[46:30] himself amongst us that the word is
[46:31] always the main thing
[46:33] the word is always the major christ who
[46:36] is present amongst us he's the one that
[46:38] does the works and it doesn't lift up
[46:40] man it doesn't lift up any order it
[46:42] doesn't lift up anything secondary it
[46:44] all points to him who's present amongst
[46:46] us
[46:48] and so we can never major on a minor but
[46:51] the minor leads to the major so
[46:54] beautiful
[46:55] and when i pick up on this
[46:58] uh maybe i might want to take it that
[47:00] the major with the minor
[47:02] and how they work
[47:03] let's look back at john chapter 6 verse
[47:05] 66 from that time many of his disciples
[47:07] went back and walked no more with them
[47:11] the minor didn't lead to the major for
[47:12] them
[47:14] then said jesus unto the twelve will ye
[47:17] also go away
[47:19] then simon peter answered him lord to
[47:22] whom shall we go
[47:25] thou hast the words of eternal life
[47:29] peter's answer was well lord there's
[47:31] really no other charismatic ministries
[47:33] in the land today
[47:35] i don't know of anybody else who could
[47:36] take five loaves and two fish and feed
[47:38] five thousand and have leftovers i don't
[47:40] know anybody else who can cast out
[47:41] devils don't know anybody else who can
[47:43] turn water to wine peter does not point
[47:46] back to the secondary signs he points to
[47:49] major christ
[47:51] he points to the major and he says to
[47:54] you lord where else would we go thou
[47:56] hast the words of eternal life and we
[47:58] believe and are sure that thou art that
[48:02] christ the son of the living god
[48:05] if i could say it worked
[48:07] it had worked on peter a very disciple
[48:10] of john who had gone through the paces
[48:12] of the introduction and the keynote and
[48:15] the one who introduced jesus christ and
[48:17] now jesus christ is the one who
[48:19] introduced the faith to the disciples so
[48:22] the forerunner had worked on peter now
[48:25] the very one who's to reveal himself it
[48:28] works on peter because now he comes to a
[48:31] place to say i know that you are the
[48:33] messiah i know that you're the son of
[48:35] god
[48:36] he didn't say well you know at least
[48:37] we've got a prophet well i can always go
[48:39] back to john
[48:41] no he said we know that you're the
[48:43] messiah that was to come to the world
[48:45] and i'm going to wrap this up this isn't
[48:48] necessary just alluding to a moment ago
[48:50] this is a necessary foundation on these
[48:52] things
[48:53] that before before we begin to teach on
[48:55] divine healing i want us to know that
[48:57] it's the lord that healeth all thy
[48:58] diseases
[49:00] i find in my heart that i've i'm
[49:02] desperate to see uh certain ones healed
[49:05] to take god at his word to be delivered
[49:07] of things that have plagued them and i
[49:09] want to see god move and not be hindered
[49:11] at all and i'm desirous to see those
[49:13] things happen in our midst but i want
[49:16] our faith to run at a higher level
[49:18] and so there's a there's a real
[49:20] sensitivity on my part that as we ask
[49:22] god to come as we ask god to move as we
[49:24] desire to see god vindicate his presence
[49:27] amongst us that our loved ones who are
[49:29] lost would be saved the hard-hearted
[49:31] would have that broken down and they
[49:32] would accept it that i want the blind
[49:34] eyes the spiritually blind eyes to see
[49:37] jesus christ standing amongst us the
[49:39] same yesterday today and forever that
[49:41] when that happens it's the soul that's
[49:44] saved
[49:44] [Applause]
[49:46] they come to know christ and that our
[49:48] faith begins to run at a higher level
[49:51] not to create a pattern in a cycle of
[49:53] revival and death within our own church
[49:56] and that we're just on this pattern of
[49:57] all we have a great time then we just
[49:59] die die die die we all get re-baptized
[50:01] and we have a great time we die die die
[50:03] i don't want cycles i want our faith to
[50:05] run at a higher level
[50:08] amen in john chapter 1 verse 50 i don't
[50:11] know if i provided this but it says
[50:13] when
[50:18] philip
[50:21] philip is called to follow
[50:24] christ
[50:26] and nathanael is coming just on philip's
[50:29] word
[50:30] and jesus discerns them
[50:33] he says it says one in whom there's no
[50:35] guile
[50:38] and he says before philip called thee
[50:41] and i believe when he made this
[50:42] statement
[50:44] when thou was under the fig tree i saw
[50:46] thee
[50:47] so even before philip went to go get you
[50:50] even before philip called you he
[50:52] referred to something perhaps very
[50:53] personal
[50:55] to nathanael
[50:56] you remember that day under the fig tree
[50:59] maybe he cried out for the messiah
[51:02] maybe he longed to see the one who could
[51:04] uh
[51:05] the one that was promised and when he
[51:07] says this
[51:10] his answer is rabbi thou art the son of
[51:13] god thou art the king of israel amen
[51:16] one sign
[51:18] philip invites them to church show up to
[51:20] church just one service you're it
[51:23] you're the messiah i believe you and
[51:25] jesus says because i said unto thee i
[51:28] saw thee under the fig tree you believe
[51:32] just because of that
[51:34] he says thou shalt see greater things
[51:35] than these
[51:37] meaning that whenever you see yes i saw
[51:41] and believed and whenever you truly see
[51:44] the miracle and that provokes the faith
[51:46] then you're in line to see greater
[51:48] things
[51:49] but if you don't see you're always going
[51:50] to want to go back to that and back to
[51:52] that and back to that because you never
[51:53] really saw what was there but now once
[51:56] you see it then you know
[51:58] you know there's something there you
[52:00] know that it's real and then you can see
[52:02] greater things
[52:04] those of us who have seen the
[52:05] vindication those of us that have seen
[52:08] god perform signs and wonders and
[52:10] miracles then we can see greater things
[52:14] greater than these
[52:16] he says brother abraham says on the
[52:19] first seal and there's coming forth
[52:20] seven mysterious thunders that's not
[52:23] even written at all
[52:25] and i believe that through those seven
[52:26] thunders will be revealed in the last
[52:27] days in order to get the bride together
[52:29] for rapturing faith
[52:32] this is what we need we need we need
[52:34] faith for a rapture
[52:36] he says because what we got right now we
[52:38] wouldn't be able to do it
[52:40] there's something we've got to
[52:42] got to step farther
[52:45] we can't have enough faith for divine
[52:47] healing hardly
[52:49] we've got to have enough faith to be
[52:50] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[52:52] of this earth
[52:55] if you really take it for exactly what
[52:57] he's saying
[52:59] is we don't even have enough faith for
[53:01] divine healing and you think you're
[53:02] going to have enough faith for a change
[53:03] body
[53:06] i think we do ourselves a disservice
[53:08] then when we try to carve out
[53:10] the supernatural of the word of god
[53:13] and maybe it's maybe it's our own
[53:15] unbelief
[53:16] that we just say oh well i mean i
[53:18] believe but it's not for me or
[53:20] you know really no i'm fine with my arm
[53:22] mangled up like this you know i'm fine
[53:25] even sister esther testified i'm not
[53:27] happy staying at home i i'm not just
[53:30] going to endure and say this is my law
[53:32] and i guess this is my cross no there
[53:34] are certain promises in the word of god
[53:35] i want all that he has for me i want to
[53:37] walk in all his promises i want to live
[53:39] above this i want to live above that i
[53:41] want to overcome and i want to have
[53:43] i want to enjoy all his benefits and all
[53:45] his blessings and so i'll say this he's
[53:48] saying there's something coming seven
[53:50] mysterious thunders that's not even
[53:51] written at all that's going to be
[53:52] revealed to get the bride ready for
[53:54] rapturing faith he says because what
[53:56] we've got now we don't have we've got to
[53:58] take a step further so then if he says
[54:00] we don't have enough faith for divine
[54:01] healing right now but something comes to
[54:04] cause us to take a step further you have
[54:06] what it takes for divine healing
[54:08] if you've got power to change this body
[54:11] you've got power to see this body healed
[54:15] why because the minor leads to the major
[54:19] the sermon one in a million
[54:21] this might have been part of the radio
[54:23] program i was pulling out
[54:24] uh
[54:26] just many different things i just just
[54:28] saw such a tremendous grace of god and
[54:30] pulling this together today just at a
[54:31] very late hour
[54:33] just wasn't sure what direction to go
[54:35] and what i was going to be preaching
[54:36] just a very very difficult day for me
[54:38] and i just just saw the supernatural
[54:40] handle god bring these things together
[54:43] and he says in one in a million he says
[54:45] and divine healing usually draws an
[54:47] attention to people
[54:48] and brings them into the presence of god
[54:51] god does something that they know is
[54:54] well it's not understood
[54:56] we cannot mechanically show how it's
[54:58] done
[54:59] god does it in his own great way
[55:02] then that attracts the attention of the
[55:05] people
[55:07] to know that there's a presence of a
[55:08] power somewhere
[55:10] that can do something that's beyond
[55:12] under human understanding
[55:15] and that causes them to look to the lamb
[55:17] of god
[55:18] that's what it ought to do
[55:22] and it's not that it's you're not that
[55:24] you're chasing your tell
[55:26] but my it makes the word so important in
[55:28] a day of impersonations and fanaticism
[55:31] to be connected to the word of god
[55:35] and that when a real the real thing that
[55:37] is performed the real thing is done it
[55:39] creates a hunger
[55:41] to then look to the lamb of god
[55:44] and that's the way that god will do it
[55:45] in any child of god's heart any elect
[55:47] seeds heart they can see the
[55:48] supernatural performed anywhere and it
[55:51] makes them hungry for the lamb of god
[55:52] and they won't stop seeking until they
[55:55] find them
[55:56] they'll never be satisfied in
[55:57] denominations they'll never be
[55:58] dissatisfied in religion they'll never
[56:00] be satisfied in something nominal
[56:02] they'll never be satisfied in just uh
[56:04] conventions and revivals they gotta they
[56:06] want to know the lamb
[56:08] because that's what the that's what it
[56:10] attracted
[56:11] their attention
[56:12] to a presence of a power somewhere it's
[56:15] beyond human understanding that causes
[56:17] them to look
[56:18] to the lamb of god
[56:21] and the sermon leadership i'll make this
[56:23] my last statement
[56:25] i had been um listening to brother uh
[56:30] where the reginald ben david platt had
[56:32] shared with me
[56:34] some quotes from the sermon as i was
[56:35] with moses while i'll be within i just
[56:37] been studying through it and reading it
[56:38] tremendous things had stood out to me
[56:40] that i thought i might use tonight
[56:41] brother branham makes this statement the
[56:43] sign is not the commission the sign only
[56:45] points to the commission
[56:47] he's very conscious of this change in
[56:49] his ministry and it fit right in line
[56:50] with the the things that we'd been
[56:52] ministered on to to see that brother
[56:54] branham's recognizing there's that
[56:55] emphasis that can be put so much on the
[56:57] signs that the commission suffers
[57:00] you're not walking in that commission
[57:03] but it's for the attraction of the
[57:04] people my last statement of sermon
[57:06] leadership december 7 1965 you know the
[57:09] importance of this
[57:10] and any message that's come in a genuine
[57:12] born-again message of god is different
[57:14] from the old trend i love that statement
[57:17] this message is different from the old
[57:19] trend what people try to make up this
[57:20] message just to force it right into that
[57:22] same old trend it's different he says
[57:23] when a divine healing went forth not
[57:25] long ago did you notice how the
[57:26] impersonators followed it
[57:29] every one of them went right into the
[57:31] organization staying there
[57:33] does anyone know that there had to be a
[57:35] message follow that
[57:37] god don't entertain us he attracts our
[57:40] attention with something
[57:42] and when he attracts our attention
[57:44] then he's got his message
[57:47] amen
[57:49] that's what that that's what divine
[57:50] healing is for
[57:52] that's what the minor is for that's what
[57:53] the secondary is for
[57:55] he sent his word
[57:57] and he healed them of their diseases he
[57:58] sent his word and delivered them from
[58:00] their destructions i am the lord the
[58:02] word that healeth all thy diseases
[58:04] that's the original primary way that's
[58:06] the way god works and then he gives
[58:08] gifts
[58:10] he gives the gifts and he manifests
[58:12] himself not that that would become the
[58:14] destination and the ultimate but that
[58:16] that would get our attention to seek for
[58:18] the voice that follows the sign
[58:21] the message that follows he says god
[58:25] don't entertain us
[58:27] the divine healing is to attract us
[58:30] because there's a message that comes
[58:32] so all the supernaturals to be causing
[58:35] us to dig deeper into the message
[58:37] know it understand desire it because
[58:39] this message is more than just divine
[58:41] healing
[58:42] more than just healing of the body
[58:45] there was promises divine promises of
[58:47] god to the gentile bride that are opened
[58:50] up to this word of god and that's the
[58:52] major
[58:53] that's the major god bless you let's
[58:55] stand tonight
