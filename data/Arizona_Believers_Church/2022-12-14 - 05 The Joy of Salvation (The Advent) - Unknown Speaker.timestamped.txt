[0:00] this is a continuation of the subject of
[0:03] the joy of Salvation and tonight we're
[0:06] taking the title of the Advent and we'll
[0:08] touch on that here in a moment just uh
[0:10] that very familiar phrase for many
[0:12] people during this time of year but just
[0:14] a few statements at the outset quickly
[0:16] about what we ministered on Sunday and
[0:18] just to kind of reset because we are
[0:20] continuing on though we're going to be
[0:22] speaking on the Advent or his coming uh
[0:24] there's this when we looked at tis the
[0:26] season it was uh I could maybe summarize
[0:29] it this way that our joy should be in
[0:32] the present work of God that he's doing
[0:33] in the time that we're living in and we
[0:36] praise them for what he's done we look
[0:37] forward to what he's going to be doing
[0:38] but the real pure joy and the true joy
[0:40] we have is in what God is doing present
[0:42] tense we know that God is a present
[0:44] tense God he says he's the I am so where
[0:47] he's working presently what he's doing
[0:49] presently is where you're going to
[0:50] really find your strength and the Bible
[0:52] says the joy of the Lord is my strength
[0:54] it's our happiness in the work that he
[0:57] is doing and happiness in what he's
[0:58] doing right now and that's where we take
[1:00] taking that phrase of tis the season
[1:02] that this is the season uh for something
[1:05] it's a time period the appropriate time
[1:08] the appropriate moment and what we
[1:10] really emphasize as we looked into
[1:11] trying to do God of service without it
[1:13] being his will the example there
[1:14] Nehemiah in different places that the
[1:16] open of the seals begins our season or
[1:19] is our season of Joy it's our time of
[1:22] rejoicing and we read that state where
[1:24] Brethren said talk about a happy time
[1:26] what was he referring to when those
[1:27] seals were open it was a happy time
[1:29] brother Branham said that when that
[1:31] seventh seal is opened everything is
[1:33] worship so that's the season that we're
[1:35] living and it's a time of Praise it's a
[1:36] time of worship it's a time of rejoice
[1:38] and you say well brother Aaron was it a
[1:40] time of rejoicing a hundred years ago
[1:42] yes was the time rejoicing 300 years ago
[1:44] yes it's it's a there's always reason to
[1:47] praise there's always reason to Rejoice
[1:48] but we don't want to be rejoicing in a
[1:50] former light we want to be rejoicing in
[1:52] the light of God's word for the time
[1:54] that we're living in and so those are
[1:56] just some summary thoughts on tis the
[1:58] season tonight on the Advent
[2:00] uh I'm sure that you all have seen
[2:03] um Advent calendars maybe some of you
[2:05] are doing your Advent chocolates and
[2:06] things like that anybody any young
[2:08] people doing the Advent calendars that
[2:09] have chocolates in them come on Jack
[2:11] raise your hand I know you're doing it
[2:14] and uh he's the only one I know in my
[2:16] family who's maybe saving them day you
[2:18] know for the appropriate day
[2:19] but the uh they do these things and
[2:22] we're so we're familiar with the
[2:23] terminology and it really is a kind of a
[2:26] phrase that's used in the nominal
[2:27] churches it's a season of their church
[2:29] year they have different seasons and
[2:31] different times and they're celebrating
[2:33] Christ's birth so the Advent in a
[2:35] nominal church or in Catholicism and
[2:37] denominations they have the Advent and
[2:39] it's this season it's a four Sunday
[2:41] Cycle that usually ends on Christmas Eve
[2:44] or the Feast of epiphany and it is a
[2:47] time where they're celebrating Christ's
[2:48] birth and so as they as they come to
[2:50] celebrate his birth there's this
[2:51] anticipation there's this expectation
[2:53] you have so many chocolates and did you
[2:55] get down and you're finally at the last
[2:57] one you know you've arrived at the time
[2:59] when Christ was born that they they
[3:01] observe his birth we know he wasn't born
[3:03] in December and so it's not only
[3:05] connected to his first coming but they
[3:08] also join into it the Advent is as it
[3:11] kind of looks to the expectance of this
[3:13] baby coming and that time when the baby
[3:16] was born that it also is joined with the
[3:18] second Advent of Christ the expectation
[3:21] of his return so those are some of the
[3:22] themes that the people use the churches
[3:25] use when it comes to Advent I think with
[3:27] last year when we preached on Christmas
[3:29] we looked at how holidays originally
[3:32] referred to the holy days and the old
[3:34] English as a whole holiday is a holy day
[3:36] and it referred to the season of Advent
[3:39] and so that's what we're actually
[3:41] preaching on is the Advent but I want to
[3:44] use it in this sense which the word just
[3:47] itself would mean an important arrival
[3:50] it comes from a Latin phrase that means
[3:51] to arrive or to come to this conjugation
[3:54] of this preface fix and suffix of
[3:58] um to come that's what it means this
[4:00] Advent it means to come or to arrive and
[4:03] the word could have actually been used
[4:04] in the scripture in different places
[4:05] that's translated to coming in Acts
[4:08] chapter 7 verse 52 it says which of the
[4:10] prophets have not your fathers
[4:12] persecuted and they have slain them
[4:13] which showed before of the coming of the
[4:17] just one of whom ye have of whom you
[4:19] have been now the betrayers and
[4:21] murderers tell it like it is and so he's
[4:24] saying that it says before of the coming
[4:27] of the just one that word coming there's
[4:29] the Advent the the arrival of the one
[4:31] that the coming that's what it's
[4:33] translated to is this word could have
[4:35] been or the Advent the arrival of our of
[4:38] the just one and so this is how it's
[4:40] used in the book of Acts and the same
[4:42] thought is in this in Matthew chapter 24
[4:45] verse 27 it says for as the lightning
[4:48] cometh out of the East and shineth even
[4:49] unto the West so shall also the coming
[4:52] of the son of man be the word there
[4:54] could have been Advent and it but yet
[4:56] it's translated to coming but in its
[4:59] definition and the Lexicon as you look
[5:01] at what the word means in the Greek it
[5:03] refers to an advent or an arrival the
[5:06] word itself means it's the presence is
[5:08] translated to presence the presence or a
[5:10] rival comes from the word to be
[5:12] alongside of or to be with to be to be
[5:15] present with so when we say Advent and a
[5:18] lot of times think this is important
[5:19] when we think about Cummings we think
[5:21] about in a moment we'll be changing the
[5:23] twink of an eye will be changed and so
[5:25] we think as Lightning lighted from the
[5:26] East to the West we kind of Imagine The
[5:28] coming or an advent to just kind of be
[5:30] like this snatch just real quick like a
[5:32] frog sticking out his tongue gets the
[5:34] fly and the tongue retracts and it
[5:36] happens so fast we don't know what
[5:37] happened but the word doesn't imply just
[5:40] a real quick visitation but an advent or
[5:42] a coming again it's not a brief
[5:44] appearance but it's an arrival and a
[5:47] lingering alongside of it's a presence
[5:49] with and that's what his first coming
[5:51] was when he came as a baby in the manger
[5:53] it wasn't just making an appearance as a
[5:55] baby but he grew up to full stature he
[5:57] was offered as a sacrifice it was all
[5:59] these different things that were
[6:00] manifested in that season and so an
[6:02] advent is not just a quick appearance
[6:04] but it's an arrival and a continued
[6:06] presence with
[6:07] and so there's two things I want to
[6:10] I've been wanting to just find the right
[6:12] place to use it and we could spend a lot
[6:15] of time on either one of these
[6:16] principles but how this was originally
[6:18] inspired to me as I was reading through
[6:20] the scriptures and studying different
[6:21] things is you'll find that his coming is
[6:23] always and often associated with joy and
[6:27] salvation and there's ways that you can
[6:29] begin to track it to her when it speaks
[6:31] of his coming it has to do with
[6:32] salvation and where there's salvation
[6:34] there ought to be joy and so there's
[6:36] different ways that it's phrased it's
[6:38] presence and joy is linked togethers his
[6:40] coming and salvation linked together joy
[6:42] and salvation are linked together and so
[6:44] there's a lot of places that these
[6:45] things are joined together so I want to
[6:48] look at how his comment is associated
[6:49] with salvation It's associated with joy
[6:52] and I would say that the subject of the
[6:55] coming of the Lord which whether you're
[6:57] looking at his first coming his second
[6:58] coming no matter what coming you're
[7:00] looking at as of critical importance and
[7:03] as a matter of fact Peter prophesies
[7:04] that in the last days it's going to be
[7:06] the very message of his coming that's
[7:08] scoffed at the very messy of his coming
[7:11] is what it is is what they laugh at and
[7:14] they score and they deride and they try
[7:15] to delude the truth of so it's something
[7:17] that's very important
[7:19] and be an important and being scoffed at
[7:22] it's very easy for it to be
[7:23] misunderstood and it can be
[7:24] controversial so I want to use this
[7:26] statement from question and answers to
[7:30] um to settle your hearts and to
[7:33] uh
[7:35] acknowledge the power of God in your
[7:37] life to reveal to you the word that you
[7:39] need to know and that you need to
[7:40] understand and that it's not it's not
[7:43] the preacher's job to explain it to you
[7:44] it's not the preacher's job to interpret
[7:46] to you interpret it to you but a man of
[7:49] God must be faithful to what the Bible
[7:51] has said and faithful to what the
[7:52] prophet is taught and desirous that it
[7:55] would be quickened to you that it would
[7:56] be revealed to you what what is meant in
[7:58] the word of God so I read this and in
[8:00] reading it I'm wanting to acknowledge
[8:01] the holy spirit in your life to speak to
[8:04] you what the word of God is what it is
[8:06] in the word of God what the prophet
[8:07] wanted you to know and and also to hold
[8:10] myself accountable to what the prophet
[8:12] said and you'll find this statement is
[8:14] just so on point I know you're probably
[8:17] familiar with it but to me it's one of
[8:18] the most
[8:19] um one of the outstanding quotes that I
[8:21] like to always have very near me he says
[8:23] I can say one thing and I'm so
[8:25] misunderstood or say it's this way or
[8:27] that way and one gets it way on this
[8:29] side
[8:30] and so that just think about that
[8:32] statement I can say one thing and I'm
[8:34] misunderstood or say it's this way or
[8:36] that way and one gets it way on this
[8:38] side so I say it this way one gets it
[8:40] over here and now he describes it and
[8:42] the way it is you say something right
[8:45] straight towards a point
[8:47] and one hears it this way
[8:49] so he tells another one and leans a
[8:51] little farther and the next one leans a
[8:54] little farther and next a little farther
[8:56] and then it's like it's got Plum out of
[8:59] cater
[9:00] is this not exactly what happens Prophet
[9:03] says something then the next the person
[9:04] hears it a little they hear it kind of
[9:06] in this slant
[9:07] so they repeat that and then the next
[9:09] person's already kind of leaning and
[9:11] before you know it it's gone way away
[9:13] from what he intended because he says
[9:15] one hears it this other way
[9:17] and he goes this way that way and that
[9:20] way see and you get away and the way
[9:22] that he describes it very well brother
[9:24] Ram could make one statement that's
[9:26] straight to the point and one hears it
[9:28] this way and then they tell another
[9:30] person they lead a little bit this way
[9:31] and they end up over here and then the
[9:33] same statement he makes someone hears it
[9:36] this way and it leans this way and leans
[9:38] this way and you can have people bait on
[9:40] the same statement divided just as far
[9:42] as East is from the West
[9:44] so he says see and you get away and
[9:46] that's the way it is out in the meetings
[9:47] and so forth when you're really driving
[9:49] right to a spot
[9:52] so he's wanting to make a point he's
[9:53] wanting to hammer something down he's
[9:55] one and he has something he needs to say
[9:57] and he says he's misunderstood uh some
[10:00] hear it a certain way to kind of hear it
[10:01] through their filter and when they
[10:03] filter it and one gets a little bit
[10:04] further and that's how people get very
[10:05] extreme on some ideas he says now the
[10:08] elected would hear that spot
[10:10] they get that spot and you're the
[10:13] elected that he's talking about brother
[10:15] Bradham says something in the message of
[10:17] the hour it's preserved for us you can
[10:18] hear it for yourself isn't it beautiful
[10:20] that you can hear it for yourself what a
[10:22] privilege that we can hear it for
[10:23] ourselves that we ought to have a burden
[10:24] that other believers who know other
[10:26] languages can hear it in their language
[10:28] hear it for themselves so that they can
[10:31] hear that spot they get that spot they
[10:34] know because I said just exactly was
[10:36] meant like that just the message just
[10:38] exactly
[10:39] and so there's that way that brother
[10:41] Branham said things and he's trying to
[10:42] drive a point home he wants us to hear
[10:44] something and there's ways that it can
[10:46] be pulled into extremes but what we want
[10:47] to know is we want to get that spot we
[10:50] want to know exactly what brother
[10:51] Branham was saying and so that I think
[10:53] that's an important statement to always
[10:54] keep in mind when it comes to the
[10:55] message of the hour now just a couple
[10:57] scriptures to establish this principle
[10:59] though there's many that could be used
[11:01] and you're always welcome to share with
[11:02] me the ones that the Lord has inspired
[11:04] to you I enjoyed the fellowship around
[11:05] the things of God and the scripture but
[11:07] it's coming in Salvation to get the
[11:10] coming
[11:11] is associated coming it's coming in
[11:13] Salvation or associated with joy and
[11:16] here is a scripture in Isaiah chapter 25
[11:18] verses 8 and 9. so we look at his coming
[11:20] and salvation both those things his
[11:22] coming and salvation are associated with
[11:25] joy it says in Isaiah chapter 25 verses
[11:27] 8 and 9 he will swallow up death and
[11:30] victory when did Paul say that was going
[11:31] to happen when the Last Enemy which is
[11:33] death is placed under your feet then it
[11:36] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[11:38] death is swallowed up in Victory so we
[11:39] see this as an end time prophecy and
[11:41] promise and the Lord God will wipe away
[11:43] tears from off all faces and the rebuke
[11:46] of his people shall be taken away from
[11:47] all the Earth from off all the Earth for
[11:50] the Lord hath spoken it and it shall be
[11:52] said in that day Lo This Is Our God we
[11:55] have waited for him and he will save us
[11:57] so there's the Salvation this the
[11:59] Salvation to come this looking forward
[12:01] to this anticipation of what this very
[12:03] deliverance from Death the Salvation
[12:05] from Death this Last Enemy being
[12:07] defeated says we've waited for him he
[12:09] tear it and he waited and he waited and
[12:10] he waited but he will come we've waited
[12:12] for him and he will save us this is the
[12:14] Lord we have waited for him him we will
[12:16] be glad and rejoice in his salvation so
[12:20] you see some of those themes in this his
[12:21] coming to defeat death this waiting for
[12:24] him to arrive and he arrives and when he
[12:26] does it brings forth this power that
[12:28] defeats death and it says we've waited
[12:30] for him but now he's come and so we will
[12:33] rejoice in his salvation this is his
[12:36] coming and his salvation being
[12:39] associated with joy because it says
[12:40] we'll be glad and rejoice in it
[12:42] we'll rejoice in his salvation in Isaiah
[12:45] chapter 66 verse 5 it says hear the word
[12:47] of the Lord ye that tremble at his word
[12:49] your brethren that hated you that cast
[12:52] you out for my name's sake said let the
[12:54] Lord be glorified but he shall
[12:57] he but he shall appear to your joy and
[13:01] they shall be ashamed he is going to
[13:03] make himself known he's going to
[13:04] manifest himself and it's going to be to
[13:07] your joy to your excitement to your
[13:09] enthusiasm to your to your rejoice and
[13:11] he shall appear to your joy and you'll
[13:13] find other places where a little bit
[13:14] different language is used and other
[13:16] prophecies to where his his coming is a
[13:20] deliverance and his or his arrival his
[13:22] his coming to your Aid to avenge you and
[13:24] you're you so that you're not
[13:26] disappointed and and that is cause for
[13:28] rejoice and it's cause for celebration
[13:30] it's a cause to be happy you'll find it
[13:32] even in the Exodus in different places
[13:34] where he has become our Salvation And
[13:37] there's this rejoicing that's associated
[13:39] with it
[13:40] and I'll say this maybe as a second
[13:42] principle to build upon his coming and
[13:44] salvation or associated with joy and
[13:46] then I want to support this that his
[13:48] coming
[13:49] is is for the purpose of salvation
[13:52] and maybe that's a broad statement that
[13:54] you could find uh may just be stating
[13:56] the obvious but his coming is for the
[13:58] purpose of Salvation that's both his
[14:00] first coming and his second coming it's
[14:02] for the purpose of Salvation we read at
[14:05] the outset in Luke Chapter 2 verses 10
[14:06] and 11 that the Angels when they gave
[14:08] the pronounced announcement to the
[14:10] Shepherds they said I bring you good
[14:11] tidings of great joy and what what's the
[14:14] what's the course that we seek Joy to
[14:16] the World the Lord Has Come and it said
[14:18] of his arrival as a baby his birth is a
[14:21] baby in a manger and it says uh we bring
[14:23] you great Tidings or Good Tidings of
[14:25] great joy for a savior has been born
[14:27] Christ the lord has been born in the
[14:29] city of David so here's the announcement
[14:31] of his birth and it's associated with
[14:33] great joy and he's a savior and so his
[14:37] coming is associated with joy or his
[14:40] comment is associated with salvation and
[14:42] joy in Luke chapter 5 verse 32 he says I
[14:45] come not to call the righteous but
[14:46] Sinners to repentance so he said I've
[14:48] come for the purpose of sinners sinners
[14:50] repenting and in doing so finding
[14:53] salvation it says in Chapter 19 Verse 10
[14:55] for the son of man has come to seek and
[14:57] to save that which was lost hear his
[15:00] hear his ministry is for the purpose of
[15:03] salvation
[15:04] and remember what time and I know I I
[15:07] know I've said this before it happened a
[15:09] number of years ago and it was really
[15:10] striking to me I was with a minister
[15:11] fellowshipping and somehow our
[15:13] conversation veered into uh we are
[15:15] overseas ministering and he mentioned
[15:18] the out there are certain subjects that
[15:20] people disagree on and debate on and and
[15:22] I don't know if he really meant this or
[15:24] he just wasn't thinking but he said you
[15:25] know there's just some things that
[15:27] aren't salvation issues and and I'm
[15:29] thinking uh yeah okay what what would
[15:31] that be maybe Christmas lights or
[15:34] something and he said you know like the
[15:35] coming of the Lord he said that's not a
[15:37] Salvation issue and I just remember
[15:39] feeling like I just been flattened you
[15:41] know by one of those Earth rollers or
[15:42] whatever because I was like wait a
[15:44] minute you could have put any subject
[15:46] maybe in the word of God that we could
[15:48] have debated whether or not it was a
[15:49] Salvation issue other than his coming
[15:53] right like that's so that's the whole
[15:55] point of it is is salvation and so I I
[15:59] say I share that just to say it's very
[16:01] uh this is such a critical subject
[16:05] his coming is always associated with
[16:07] salvation and Christ has mentioned this
[16:09] I'm I'm coming to call Sinners to
[16:11] repentance what for that they might be
[16:12] saved and rescued from their sin I come
[16:15] I come to seek and to save that which
[16:17] was lost his coming was as a messiah to
[16:20] save the people
[16:22] and then it says in Hebrews chapter 9
[16:24] verse 28 so Christ was once offered to
[16:26] Bear the sins of many this is his first
[16:28] coming be a sacrificial lamb to shed his
[16:30] blood in order for this the salvation of
[16:32] the of those that he was sent to and
[16:34] unto them that look for him now it's a
[16:36] separate coming unto him that looked for
[16:39] him shall he appear the second time
[16:41] without sin not to deal with sin but
[16:44] unto for the purpose of salvation
[16:47] and that's and so this is an in this is
[16:49] an important uh concept to recognize his
[16:52] first coming was for salvation the to
[16:55] pay the price for sin as it says he was
[16:57] Christ was offered to Bear the sins of
[16:58] many so it's in the shedding of blood
[17:00] pain the price of redemption but he is
[17:03] promised to appear a second time a
[17:05] second coming to make himself visible to
[17:08] make himself known and it will be for
[17:10] the purpose of Salvation again
[17:13] and it has to do with that second part
[17:15] of redemption it has to do with the the
[17:17] very purpose of Salvation to begin with
[17:19] this the the entering into the taking
[17:22] possession of and so he appears a second
[17:24] time not to deal with sin but for full
[17:27] salvation a Deliverance the Bible is
[17:30] speaking of them
[17:31] and now we're familiar with the number
[17:33] of statements that brother branna makes
[17:35] with respect to this as he says and it
[17:37] is I be not afraid he comes three times
[17:40] as what we we see him teaching first
[17:42] coming to redeem his bride second coming
[17:44] to catch his bride away third time
[17:46] coming with his bride so his first
[17:49] coming as a lamb as a sacrifice to shed
[17:51] the blood to die upon a cross to raise
[17:53] again on the third day that is that
[17:55] these are those those are elements a
[17:57] part of that first coming and in that it
[17:59] is to pay the price to redeem his bride
[18:02] and the second time he appears without
[18:05] sin unto salvation that's the second
[18:07] coming to catch his bride away and
[18:09] there's also a third coming that's when
[18:10] he comes with his bride
[18:13] and Peter prophesies of this second
[18:15] coming in First Peter chapter 1 verse 5.
[18:17] speaking of the elect he says who are
[18:19] kept by the power of God through faith
[18:21] unto salvation ready to be revealed in
[18:25] the last time
[18:26] what does this tell us that there is a
[18:28] Salvation that is going to be revealed
[18:30] in the end times
[18:31] so it's the revelation of Salvation
[18:32] there's going to be a revelation in time
[18:36] and in that Revelation there is
[18:37] salvation and Paul Peter is writing this
[18:39] that the elector kept by the power of
[18:41] God through faith and that there's going
[18:43] to be a keeping of all the elect Through
[18:45] the Ages until a time when salvation is
[18:48] revealed in the end
[18:49] pays the price of redemption in his
[18:51] first coming then there's going to be a
[18:53] revelation in the end which is going to
[18:55] be the climax and the the perfecting of
[18:57] all those that sleep there's going to be
[18:59] a Salvation revealed in the last time
[19:02] so Peter picks it up eight verses later
[19:04] in verse 13 He says wherefore gird up
[19:06] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[19:08] to the end why does he tell us to hope
[19:10] to the end because there's going to be a
[19:11] Salvation revealed in the end he's told
[19:13] us this in verse 5 he says hope to the
[19:16] end for the grace salvation is by Grace
[19:18] he says for the grace that is brought
[19:20] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[19:23] Christ
[19:24] so if there's going to be a Salvation
[19:26] that's revealed in the last time there
[19:28] is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ
[19:31] so it's going to be a revelation of
[19:33] Jesus Christ and in the revelation of
[19:35] Jesus Christ it brings to us a Grace and
[19:37] it is the Salvation at the end time so
[19:41] this end time salvation at the he shall
[19:43] appear the second time for the purpose
[19:45] of Salvation this end time salvation
[19:47] comes by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[19:49] or the coming of Jesus Christ it says
[19:52] making known this manifesting of Jesus
[19:54] Christ you find that even as we read
[19:57] already in Matthew 24 it's the revealing
[19:59] of the son of man
[20:00] the revealing of the sentiment is the
[20:01] coming of the son of man scripture those
[20:03] those two things are the very same in
[20:06] those prophecies in Matthew 24 Luke 17.
[20:09] and so brother Brandon makes this
[20:11] statement this way and the sermon broken
[20:12] cisterns and you all are very attentive
[20:15] tonight listening uh very intently so I
[20:17] feel that the point is being accepted
[20:19] and we're able just to move quickly
[20:22] and the sermon broken systems brother
[20:24] Brown says so he comes first to redeem
[20:26] his bride he comes second as a rapture
[20:29] I think that's an important way that he
[20:31] uses this language he comes second as a
[20:33] Rapture to take away his bride the Lord
[20:35] himself shall descend and we know that
[20:37] there is a shout voice and Trump he does
[20:39] all three as he's descending and the
[20:41] shout is the message
[20:42] and so these are things it's a messenger
[20:44] revealing that it's a the voice of God
[20:47] that's uh bringing forth the bride as he
[20:49] teaches us these things in the Rapture
[20:51] so he comes a second time as a Rapture
[20:53] to take away his bride he comes a third
[20:55] with his bride king and queen he says
[20:57] after he says and he says that's when
[21:00] many people are expecting the coming
[21:02] and what he is identifying is most
[21:06] people have in their mind the third
[21:09] coming when they're instead of the
[21:11] second coming
[21:12] when they're thinking about the next
[21:14] coming
[21:15] does that make sense they have in their
[21:17] mind the image and the visual and the
[21:19] promises and actually maybe the uh
[21:21] certain uh characteristics that would be
[21:23] associated with the third coming that's
[21:26] what they believe to be the next coming
[21:27] or the second coming and so they get
[21:29] that in their minds oh this this is what
[21:32] we're looking for this is what's going
[21:33] to happen and brother brahm's kind of
[21:35] identifying that that there is a third
[21:37] coming that has a certain
[21:38] representations and certain images and
[21:41] they're looking to that and in looking
[21:42] to that they're expecting that but
[21:45] they've got it out of order
[21:46] because Christ in his second coming he
[21:48] does the Corporal body does not return
[21:50] back to the Earth uh to set feet on
[21:52] Earth that's in his third coming and so
[21:55] when that's what Believers believe they
[21:56] believe that Christ will return and Rule
[21:58] and Reign on the earth uh there will be
[22:00] a thousand year reign but that's not the
[22:01] second coming and as a matter of fact
[22:03] there's if you want to start getting our
[22:05] head dizzy with Cummings not only does
[22:07] he reveal himself to the Gentiles but
[22:09] he's going to reveal himself to the Jews
[22:11] and that's a coming that's a that's a
[22:14] that's a coming that brother Brennan
[22:16] refers to in the message it's a coming
[22:17] that's referred to in the scripture he
[22:18] says but when he comes this time this
[22:20] time to come as a Rapture to take away
[22:22] his bride he says hardly none but those
[22:23] who are ready will know when he comes
[22:26] to those that look for him will he
[22:27] appear to those who are looking for him
[22:29] to those who are constantly in the word
[22:31] and know what to look for to those who
[22:33] know how he's going to make himself
[22:35] known in this time they're going to
[22:37] recognize him
[22:39] and how he chooses to make himself known
[22:41] is so that we will know him as our
[22:43] bridegroom so that we'll know him as our
[22:46] savior in this end time and so these are
[22:48] just a number of principles I think that
[22:50] uh are important for us to understand I
[22:52] don't I don't believe that we've had
[22:54] opportunity to this point to maybe go
[22:56] through some of these scriptures with
[22:57] you over the last couple years so these
[22:59] are just good maybe just to enter into
[23:01] our thought process begin to consider
[23:03] them as a church and chew on them and
[23:05] find where brother Brennan places them
[23:07] in the scripture
[23:08] now to connect this with what we were
[23:11] preaching on Sunday on
[23:14] tis the season and how the time and
[23:17] season that we're living in has to do
[23:19] with the open of the the word of God the
[23:20] open of the seals in the sermon the
[23:22] breach and now when brother Branham
[23:24] preaches the breach he he takes us to
[23:27] the spot where
[23:29] he says the church ages are finished
[23:31] we're coming to these seals and he's
[23:33] preaching the breach and he's talking
[23:34] about the breach between I think even
[23:36] the full titles of the breach between
[23:37] the seven Church ages and the Seven
[23:38] Seals so when he's preaching that keep
[23:41] that in mind the breach is between
[23:43] Church ages that he feels very
[23:46] comfortable about how the loose sins
[23:47] have been tied up certain things have
[23:48] been established we're approaching the
[23:50] seals he's preaching the breach he's
[23:52] taken Revelations chapter five he says
[23:54] now he comes to take his bride
[23:57] what is this relating to is he says the
[23:59] the first coming the second coming to
[24:01] catch his bride away he comes second as
[24:03] a Rapture to take away his bride now the
[24:05] ram is looking at this and he says he
[24:07] comes to take his bride he comes now as
[24:09] king he's looking for his Queen
[24:12] this isn't coming with his Queen this is
[24:14] the king looking for his Queen in this
[24:17] book is the whole secret of it wrapped
[24:18] around Seven Seals Seven Seals waiting
[24:21] for him to come to what come take the
[24:24] book and the loose the seal so now he
[24:26] comes to take his bride and is coming to
[24:28] take his bride it's visually represented
[24:31] even in this idea of Christ or this
[24:34] image of Christ coming forward to take a
[24:36] hold of a book that's been sealed with
[24:38] Seven Seals
[24:39] and so we were reading in Revelations
[24:41] chapter 5 on Sunday how there was this
[24:43] book and the right hand of him that sat
[24:46] upon the throne of God and it was sealed
[24:48] with Seven Seals written within and
[24:50] without and there was this Proclamation
[24:52] by the strong Angel and I think we had a
[24:54] wonderful time around these things on
[24:55] Sunday uh who is worthy and now John
[24:59] begins to weep because when he says he's
[25:01] worthy there's no man that's worthy
[25:04] there's no no no one present maybe that
[25:06] anyone's thinking of well I'm not worthy
[25:08] and you're not worthy no one's found
[25:09] worthy but there was a worthy one
[25:11] and the strong Angel's voice is what
[25:13] Rouses him up and brings him forward to
[25:16] take a hold of this book and it says
[25:18] John says and I wept much Revelations
[25:20] chapter 5 verse 4 making really good
[25:22] time tonight we'll be we'll be home
[25:24] before the snow falls he says and I wept
[25:26] much because no man was found worthy to
[25:28] open and to read the book neither to
[25:30] look or thereon I know these are very
[25:31] familiar phrases to you I know we have
[25:33] already covered them maybe in great
[25:34] detail already as a church and even
[25:36] recently so John is weeping because in
[25:39] his mind based upon the silence at that
[25:41] moment or the announcement and everyone
[25:44] kind of conceding we're not worthy that
[25:46] oh does this mean the book can't be
[25:47] opened so he's weeping and one of the
[25:49] elders saith unto me weep not so now
[25:52] that's not the time to cry John Behold
[25:54] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[25:56] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[25:57] and to loose the seals thereof and I
[26:00] beheld and low in the midst of the
[26:01] throne and of the four beasts in the
[26:03] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[26:04] had been slain it's the lamb but he's
[26:06] announced as the lion
[26:07] says having seven horns and seven eyes
[26:09] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[26:11] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[26:13] took the book out of the right hand of
[26:15] him that sat upon the throne
[26:18] this is John describing what he saw this
[26:22] is what is visually being represented to
[26:23] John in this even the book of the
[26:25] revelation of Jesus Christ and these
[26:27] events that he's caught up to see and to
[26:29] witness and as he's a witness to this
[26:31] this sealed book now is being told he
[26:34] sees that the lamb has the lamb has come
[26:37] in prevailing as a lion to take a hold
[26:41] of the book and to loose the seals
[26:43] thereof he says and he came and took the
[26:46] book out of the right hand of him that
[26:48] sat upon the throne the season this
[26:50] taking of the book brother Branham
[26:52] refers to this as the most Sublime act
[26:54] in Scripture
[26:55] says this is the most Sublime thing in
[26:57] scripture he calls it a Sublime act and
[26:59] when you use the word sublime he's
[27:00] referring to the highest
[27:02] the most Supreme it's the it cannot be
[27:05] cannot be excelled
[27:07] can't be anything greater so when he
[27:09] takes us to this point he says the most
[27:10] Sublime thing in Scripture that cannot
[27:13] be excelled by anything else it's the
[27:14] highest most Supreme part then this is a
[27:17] very significant part in Scripture
[27:20] and it must have something to do with
[27:22] this coming it must have something to do
[27:24] with salvation and it must have
[27:26] something to do with our joy and it's
[27:27] something that we we cannot divorce from
[27:30] his first coming and it's something that
[27:32] we don't want to misplace or
[27:33] misunderstand but this taking of the
[27:35] book it's the Kinsmen Redeemer taking
[27:37] this book out of the right hand of him
[27:39] that sat upon the throne to claim the
[27:40] title deed of redemption for those to
[27:42] whom it belongs
[27:44] Adam had lost something in the fall I
[27:47] think we've mentioned it here recently
[27:48] and just the way that uh it's described
[27:50] as Adam having lost the title deed of
[27:53] redemption it just struck me it was only
[27:56] as of late that it really struck me that
[27:59] I know it's just symbolic but the
[28:01] language is used to suggest that even
[28:03] while Adam had it it was called The Book
[28:05] of redemption and that was Adam's first
[28:07] clue that things were going to change
[28:09] right because as as of yet there was no
[28:12] Redemption there was no need for
[28:13] Redemption but Adam could have never
[28:15] known God and we would have never known
[28:17] God in his fullness without a form and
[28:20] so the book was a clue that God had this
[28:22] all planned it's called The Plan of
[28:24] Salvation we rejoice in the Plan of
[28:26] Salvation There's Something Beautiful in
[28:28] thinking about God's Plan of Salvation I
[28:31] know that there's a way that we take the
[28:32] word salvation and we kind of just
[28:34] relegate it to the Baptist well the
[28:35] Baptists have a Ministry of Salvation
[28:37] and these people want to get you saved
[28:39] but Salvation is the greatest thing
[28:42] it's a beautiful thing and so John's
[28:45] weeping as we see it in verse 4 and his
[28:49] mourning is turned into joy and
[28:51] rejoicing in verse 13 and we do not risk
[28:53] necessarily reading it tonight but he
[28:55] said everybody heard me
[28:57] Every Creature hurt me joy rejoicing and
[29:00] giving blessing and honor and glory and
[29:02] power to him that sits upon the throne
[29:04] and the lamb forever and ever because he
[29:06] has taken the book he has prevailed he's
[29:08] overcome to take the book and to loose
[29:11] the sales thereof and so what I want you
[29:13] to catch is we talked about a season
[29:15] change on Sunday and the season had
[29:18] changed from weeping to rejoicing the
[29:21] the the very description of John in one
[29:23] moment weeping much because no man is
[29:25] found worthy and then being told wait a
[29:27] minute the line of the tribal Judith
[29:29] prevailed to loose the seals thereof and
[29:31] now his weeping is turned into rejoicing
[29:33] it's symbolic of night being turned into
[29:35] day
[29:36] because the Weeping endures for the
[29:38] night the Bible says Psalms 30 verse 5
[29:40] for his anger and Earth but a moment in
[29:42] his favor is life
[29:44] where is his favor declared in his
[29:46] countenance
[29:47] and a lot of the king's countenance
[29:49] there is life his in his favor his life
[29:50] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[29:53] cometh in the morning
[29:55] so this is this is what happens to John
[29:58] is he's weeping in that dark time he's
[30:00] weeping in that unknown time he's
[30:02] weeping in the delay he's weeping in
[30:04] that moment well wait a minute what's
[30:06] going to happen here this is John who
[30:07] possessed salvation this is John who was
[30:09] there on the day of Pentecost this is
[30:11] John who who knew who the lamb was he's
[30:13] the one that knew the sacrifice he's the
[30:15] one that had received the uh the first
[30:17] uh fruits of it and he's enjoying it and
[30:20] he's walking in it but now through this
[30:22] delay in this dark time he begins to
[30:24] weep but when his weeping is turned into
[30:25] rejoicing that's symbolic of the sun
[30:27] coming up
[30:29] the weeping may endure for a night but
[30:32] joy cometh in the morning and what is
[30:34] what is one of those themes that brother
[30:36] Brandon begins to preach at the end of
[30:37] 1963 there's a man here who could turn
[30:39] on the light and Rapture that church now
[30:41] he didn't say a man come and he said
[30:42] there's a man here who could turn on the
[30:44] light and Rapture that church and he
[30:46] said and if you think now I like the I
[30:49] like the pool you guys are given tonight
[30:50] this is good did you notice the way
[30:52] you're seating is kind of like a
[30:53] gradient too
[30:54] I don't know if you notice that
[30:56] but they uh you're pulling really really
[30:59] well
[31:01] but there's a
[31:03] uh when he when he gives that when he
[31:04] preaches that very sermon he's given us
[31:06] this description kind of what inspires
[31:08] it and he uses as an example is how they
[31:11] went down into Carlsbad Caverns and this
[31:13] uh this sister and her older brother
[31:15] there's with them they go down and and
[31:18] they're in this great great big cavern
[31:19] and also the lights turn off
[31:21] and the little girl starts crying and
[31:23] she's getting all nervous she's crying
[31:25] and she says her little brother says
[31:27] don't worry honey
[31:28] there's a man here who could turn on the
[31:30] light
[31:31] and then brother Brandon when he just
[31:33] when he's sharing that uh sharing that
[31:36] um testimony he says because the brother
[31:38] was standing next to the man who could
[31:41] turn on the light so he's standing next
[31:43] to him and he's given us this perfect
[31:45] image of how don't worry Brian don't
[31:46] worry sister don't worry when it seems
[31:49] dark don't worry there's one who is
[31:51] standing near the man who could turn
[31:53] standing near the engineer maybe in the
[31:55] phrase he uses he said don't worry honey
[31:57] I know he's here and he has the power to
[32:00] turn on the light and Rapture that
[32:02] church
[32:03] and as he enters into 1964 he's
[32:06] preaching shalom shalom shalom preaches
[32:08] it here in Arizona he preaches this
[32:09] sermon I think even in Phoenix and what
[32:11] does he say preaching it's good morning
[32:13] to the church
[32:14] it's a Setting Sun to the world it's a
[32:16] Setting Sun on laodicea but now it's a
[32:18] Rising Sun it is the rise of the Sun and
[32:20] when he's preaching Shalom good morning
[32:22] to the bride what does that mean time of
[32:25] weeping is over joy cometh in the
[32:28] morning so our joy has been found in
[32:30] that Rising Sun
[32:33] and so brother Branham visits this in
[32:34] the sermon the breach
[32:36] and he says talk about a jubilee talk
[32:39] about a time when the lamb walked forth
[32:41] see the books even sealed in heaven the
[32:44] Mysteries are now think about this
[32:46] phrase because I'm going to come to this
[32:47] on Sunday says say is my name there
[32:51] I don't know I hope it is
[32:53] but if it is it was put on the book
[32:56] before the foundation of the world again
[32:57] this is the breach preach after between
[33:00] the seven Church ages and the Seven
[33:02] Seals so brother Branham even himself
[33:04] was in this time of what is this going
[33:06] to be there's things he doesn't know
[33:08] until they're actually open he says but
[33:10] I hope it is but if it was if it is it
[33:12] was put on the book before the
[33:13] foundation of the world
[33:15] but the first thing that represented
[33:16] that Redemption
[33:18] come the lamb that had been slain from
[33:20] the foundation of the world
[33:22] and this is now notice what brother
[33:24] Brown does in this this next statement
[33:26] he's talking about he's preaching the
[33:28] breach he's talking about the book
[33:29] that's sealed and he's talking about the
[33:31] lamb who's been slain before the
[33:33] foundation of the world and he took the
[33:35] book
[33:37] open the book
[33:38] tore off the seals
[33:41] and sent it down to the Earth to his
[33:43] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[33:45] and this next phrase is great however
[33:47] you want to take it there you are
[33:49] there you are there you are right there
[33:53] you are
[33:54] and notice how what he has done and this
[33:56] is I think uh I was raising the message
[33:58] I've uh
[34:00] who spent my spent my last you know over
[34:04] 20 uh last 25 years or so or uh 27 years
[34:08] you know in the word of God studying the
[34:10] word of God uh fellowship and the word
[34:12] of God with people all over the world
[34:13] and Men of God and preachers around the
[34:15] world and Believers and so some of these
[34:17] things can be very controversial but I'm
[34:19] telling you you have to ignore the
[34:22] message to say that brother Branham
[34:24] wasn't tying Revelations 5 and
[34:26] Revelations 10 to his present Ministry
[34:28] because he says it right here he says he
[34:30] took the book open the seals tore off
[34:31] the seal sent down to earth to the
[34:32] seventh angel he revealed to his people
[34:33] he says there you are
[34:35] right and then when brother Branham is
[34:36] preaching these things in 1963 these
[34:38] things have tremendous weight especially
[34:40] considering what everyone was under
[34:42] expectation and prior preconceived ideas
[34:44] of how things would take place and even
[34:46] brother Branham himself is very heavy
[34:48] with the weight of what is transpiring
[34:50] and you want to talk about his heaviness
[34:52] I believe maybe we fellowshipped on it
[34:53] here uh before how brother Branham when
[34:56] he preached his souls in prison now he's
[34:58] saying oh we know what's happened we see
[35:01] what's taking place he says could it be
[35:03] then that we're at this time when these
[35:06] events have transpired and it's too late
[35:08] right I mean these are the questions
[35:10] that he's asking in that sermon and and
[35:12] I'm sure many of you could probably
[35:13] remember the first time you ever heard
[35:15] it and just how uh uh how much concern
[35:19] it would cause and the Weeping and even
[35:21] the seriousness and the stubbornness
[35:22] that brother Branham is using because
[35:24] he's recognizing that something
[35:27] significant has happened with respect to
[35:29] the open of the seals and and there was
[35:32] a way that you could look at it to say
[35:33] oh well then this means it's over the
[35:35] days salvation the door is shut it's
[35:37] finished he's claimed the last one and
[35:39] we are all now just he's like even if I
[35:42] could put it in my own words I didn't
[35:43] think we'd be here this long I didn't
[35:45] know it would take this long I don't
[35:46] know why we're still here maybe we're
[35:48] just now manifesting the word to people
[35:50] who can never be saved and that isn't
[35:53] that the theme of it
[35:54] and it's in that very sermon where he
[35:56] says Revelations 5 it's in paragraph 139
[35:58] he says immediately it comes to
[35:59] Revelations 10 7.
[36:01] so there's a there's a this Revelations
[36:03] 5 7 is then immediately connected to
[36:06] Revelations 10 7. why because the book
[36:08] that's opened in Revelations 5 comes to
[36:10] the seventh angel on the earth to reveal
[36:12] it to the people
[36:14] and now I'll say this not to just leave
[36:16] the sermon souls in prison now
[36:19] as as the door being shot this is
[36:21] Brother Branham wrestling with the
[36:22] implication of what of what has happened
[36:24] in saying could it be
[36:26] and I believe things continue to unfold
[36:28] uh to where he he is very clear that the
[36:31] door of Salvation has not been shut that
[36:34] the things he's considering things he's
[36:36] looking at it's not wasn't the end of
[36:37] Salvation it wasn't no more no one could
[36:39] be saved from that moment on but he does
[36:41] make a statement to me that turns
[36:43] everything around at the very end he
[36:45] says think of it could it be
[36:46] and he's even referring I've got
[36:48] children out there there I've got lost
[36:49] loved ones he says could it be could
[36:51] this be and he goes and just to think of
[36:53] it we've made it
[36:55] right and he's saying we wait he's
[36:57] looking at the beauty of what has been
[36:59] made known is that there's something
[37:01] here available in the end time to snatch
[37:03] us from death into life there's
[37:05] something a quickening power that's come
[37:07] to us to preserve us and to keep us and
[37:09] that's where we want to be he says and
[37:10] to think of it oh yes there's a horrible
[37:12] side to all of this but just to think
[37:14] that there is a place that he wants to
[37:16] bring you into where he says I've made
[37:18] it
[37:18] I'm secure I'm safe
[37:21] and so in this
[37:24] um
[37:24] talk about a jubilee
[37:27] talk about rejoicing this time when the
[37:29] lamb comes forward and takes the book
[37:30] and he says now he sent it down to earth
[37:31] to Revelations 10 7. so in Revelations
[37:34] chapter 10 verses 1 to 3.
[37:37] he says I saw another Mighty Angel come
[37:39] down from heaven clothed with the cloud
[37:41] and a rainbow was upon his head
[37:43] and his face was the word the Sun and
[37:46] his feet his pillars of fire these are
[37:48] descriptions that have important meaning
[37:51] he has he's clothed the cloud and the
[37:53] rainbows upon his head it tells us this
[37:55] is a covenant angel
[37:58] and I'll say this this Mighty angel can
[38:00] be no one else other than Christ
[38:02] and he had in his hand a little book
[38:04] open this little book open is this book
[38:06] that is unsealed in Revelations 5 and he
[38:08] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[38:10] left foot on the earth and he cried with
[38:11] a loud voice as when a lion roarth so
[38:14] here's this connection back to the line
[38:16] of the tribe of Judah he this Mighty
[38:18] Angel which is Christ Roars as a lion he
[38:21] is the lion of the tribe of Judah and he
[38:22] cried with a loud voice is when a line
[38:24] wrote and when he had cried seven
[38:25] Thunders uttered their voices
[38:27] now once these seven Thunders have
[38:30] uttered their voices John is getting
[38:31] ready to write
[38:32] and he's and he's told no don't write it
[38:35] seal up these things and so that means
[38:38] that what the mystery contained under
[38:40] those seven seals are going to be
[38:42] revealed in the seven Thunders but John
[38:43] is not going to write them so he says
[38:46] seal it up it's not that there's another
[38:47] set of seals it just means John is not
[38:49] going to write them they're going to be
[38:51] kept a secret until the time of the
[38:53] actual taking of the book and the
[38:55] revealing of these things and so
[38:57] and even if I could we could identify
[38:59] this and I know these things are just
[39:01] very apparent to you in the scripture
[39:02] that John at one time is present when it
[39:05] says who's worthy to take the book and
[39:06] to open it and the conclusion with John
[39:09] present is that nobody is worthy to take
[39:11] the book and to loose the seals there
[39:13] nobody's even worthy to look on it right
[39:15] they're not even worthy to look at this
[39:17] book and John is present so he has
[39:20] included as one who is unworthy but now
[39:22] that the book is opened and it's being
[39:24] sent back down to earth to be revealed
[39:26] uh to his people to God's people this
[39:28] King now coming uh looking for his Queen
[39:31] John here's the revelation of the seven
[39:33] Thunders and that is the significant
[39:36] event that takes John from somebody who
[39:38] wasn't even worthy to look on the book
[39:41] to be in one being told to go to him
[39:43] that has the book and ask for it
[39:46] and then being obedient to that he asked
[39:49] for it and not only does he ask for it
[39:51] and he's going to be given it but the
[39:53] mighty Angel then unfolds this very this
[39:55] other this other further part of this
[39:57] Revelation that comes when you're in
[39:59] audience with him he says take it and
[40:01] you can eat it
[40:03] now A lot's changed right if if we could
[40:07] just relate maybe these young men could
[40:08] rely on the front row that when you're
[40:09] told he's mom can I have a cupcake no
[40:11] don't don't you even touch it right
[40:14] and and how how much changes oh yeah you
[40:16] can have it you can eat it George full
[40:19] possession you can enjoy every bit of it
[40:21] what a change what changed what happened
[40:24] it was the season
[40:26] so revelation of those seven Thunders
[40:28] that revealed to John to John his worth
[40:30] and his right to take that book and then
[40:33] the angel and that personal audience he
[40:34] has with John says not only can you take
[40:37] it but you can eat it
[40:38] now brother Branham in the sermon the
[40:40] breach she says and here he returns back
[40:42] in the 10th chapter after the coming
[40:44] time
[40:45] that all the Mysteries is to be finished
[40:46] and the seals to be broke and
[40:48] proclaiming that time is no more
[40:50] so here he returns back this is this is
[40:52] him in this coming time after the coming
[40:54] time he's looking at these things in the
[40:56] breach and he's showing us that
[40:57] something is transpiring something's
[40:58] happening related to these things
[41:01] and then in the breach again he says and
[41:03] when the seals are broke and the
[41:05] Mysteries are revealed down comes the
[41:08] angel the messenger Christ
[41:11] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[41:13] the sea with the rainbow over his head
[41:17] are you paying attention to this last
[41:19] statement here
[41:20] now remember this seventh angel is is on
[41:23] Earth at the time of this coming
[41:26] if you're familiar with the different
[41:28] statements that that were part of the uh
[41:30] commissioning to brother as John the
[41:32] Baptist 4 ran and notice so he used this
[41:35] phrase just as John was given his
[41:37] message the same time that Messiah come
[41:38] in the the days John knew he would see
[41:41] him because he was going to introduce
[41:43] him and we realized that in the
[41:44] scriptures over in Malachi 4 there's
[41:46] going to be one like John and Elijah to
[41:48] whom the word of God can come to
[41:50] what is he pointing to that in
[41:52] Revelations chapter 10 verse 1 down
[41:54] comes Christ The Mighty Angel the
[41:56] messenger Christ and he says the seventh
[41:59] angel is on Earth at the time of this
[42:01] coming
[42:02] at the time that he comes this little
[42:03] book open the time when this unsealed
[42:06] book is coming down out of Heaven we're
[42:08] using a symbolic language right we're
[42:10] using a language that is according to
[42:12] the scripture but he says he's on Earth
[42:13] at the time of this coming
[42:20] these things are very important to this
[42:22] brother branham's Ministry
[42:24] and now in the sermon souls in prison
[42:28] now
[42:33] notice how he he places this he says the
[42:35] lamb came for what he had redeemed
[42:38] he come to claim what he had redeemed
[42:41] he says he's already got it right here
[42:42] in the book taken it from his hand now
[42:44] he's coming to receive what he has
[42:47] redeemed think of that phrase coming to
[42:49] receive what he has redeemed price is
[42:52] paid in his first coming he is the one
[42:54] that has the purchase price he's the one
[42:56] that has the receipt he's the one to say
[42:57] I'm worthy who's worthy to loose the
[42:59] seals well the one that paid the price
[43:01] the one who gave his life he's prevailed
[43:03] now uh he not only paid the price but
[43:05] now he says he comes to receive what he
[43:07] has redeemed that is his work says he's
[43:10] done he's come to receive it oh what a
[43:13] time he's it has proven it the seventh
[43:17] seal proved it does he tell us that the
[43:19] seventh still brings him back to Earth
[43:20] so these are all very significant things
[43:22] and profound things he says he come back
[43:24] and took the book of redemption notice
[43:26] it was to be the seventh Angel's message
[43:29] that was to reveal the Seven Seals
[43:30] Revelations 10 7. he says now you'll
[43:32] find it where we're going to find it in
[43:33] the scripture
[43:35] Revelations 10 7 is the one is the
[43:37] message to reveal the Seven Seals and he
[43:39] says this is what's happening he's
[43:41] coming to receive what he's redeemed
[43:43] he's coming to take it the seventh seal
[43:45] proves that he comes back and takes the
[43:47] book of redemption this is what's
[43:49] revealed by the seventh Angel's message
[43:53] and remember
[43:56] his coming is for the purpose of
[43:59] salvation
[44:01] and it's always
[44:03] a joy
[44:06] in the sermon trying to do God of
[44:07] service without it being his will this
[44:09] is the one he preached later in in
[44:11] Shreveport at the businessman's
[44:12] breakfast
[44:14] and I this is kind of tapping back into
[44:17] where we were last Sunday as we closed
[44:18] this evening he says now let us see what
[44:20] happened when God in his time and age
[44:23] remember we read a statement very
[44:24] similar we see what happens when God in
[44:26] his time and his age is not considered
[44:28] he sees see what happened when God in
[44:30] his time and age and His prophets are
[44:31] not considered just depend on theology
[44:34] priest denominationalism like we do
[44:36] today
[44:37] now closely it gets messed up it all
[44:40] gets messed up
[44:42] if the true spirit of God there so if
[44:44] the true spirit of God is there it'll
[44:46] direct it and do the word not just one
[44:49] place in the word the entire word for
[44:51] the entire age
[44:53] so there's a lot of things that maybe we
[44:55] could be directed to and and we and it's
[44:58] and it's directed to it be very careful
[45:00] that if you see the spirit of God
[45:02] directs to another part of the word be
[45:04] very careful uh you know to not just
[45:07] instinctively disagree because
[45:09] it's directed to the word the entire
[45:12] word for the entire age someone may be
[45:14] shining a little bit of light or put a
[45:16] little bit of emphasis on one part and
[45:18] if it's in the word for the age you can
[45:19] amen it right we don't want to reject
[45:22] things we don't want to get the wrong
[45:23] kind of attitude toward things that are
[45:24] just partial truths but what we rejoice
[45:26] in is when we can have the spirit of
[45:29] Truth direct us to the word for the
[45:31] entire word for the age the entire age
[45:34] the relevant portions to the time we're
[45:36] living in so he uses this example the
[45:38] day of Pentecost the spirit directed it
[45:40] right into that to Joel 2 28. why
[45:43] because that was the scripture for that
[45:45] time that was what was the scripture was
[45:46] for That season so the spirit directs it
[45:49] into the prophecy of that time the day
[45:50] of Luther directed it right into that
[45:52] that that
[45:52] Wesley in this last Pentecostal move so
[45:56] in each age the spirit directs him to
[45:58] the word and if you were living in that
[46:00] age that's the word that you want to see
[46:01] that's the word that you receive and
[46:03] that would be your cause for rejoicing
[46:04] he says but this is another age
[46:07] this is the calling out of the Bride
[46:10] this is the catch in a way of the Bride
[46:12] this is the bride calling time this is
[46:14] the time where there's a lot there's
[46:17] something that comes forth to bring
[46:18] forth the bride not for the purpose of a
[46:20] church Revival but for the purpose of a
[46:22] rapture
[46:24] this is another age this is the cone out
[46:26] of the Bride not 2 000 years ago at
[46:28] Pentecost or the repeat or the return
[46:31] of what Pentecost
[46:34] this is exactly what he's saying this is
[46:36] not just a repeat of Pentecost this is
[46:38] not just a return to Pentecost this is
[46:40] another age and he's skipping just a
[46:42] couple paragraphs he says now this it
[46:44] now is the bride calling
[46:47] now is when the Seven Seals have been
[46:49] opened
[46:51] this is what he's emphasizing this is
[46:53] what he's showing us this is the spirit
[46:55] directing us to the promise for our day
[46:57] Revelations 5 7 Revelations 10 7
[46:59] Revelations 5 Revelations 10. this is
[47:01] the spirit of God pointing us to the
[47:04] mighty Angel descending Out of Heaven if
[47:06] we could just look at that as language
[47:07] that's descriptive of something
[47:09] transpiring because one thing to always
[47:12] remember that God that we only we use
[47:14] language and we use time and we use
[47:16] space to express something
[47:18] if you want to understand something we
[47:20] use language to describe it and we only
[47:22] make sense of it and that it occupies
[47:24] certain space and and it's relative to
[47:27] time we maybe look at those quantum
[47:28] mechanics and things we talked about
[47:30] before these different dimensions and
[47:31] way of understanding something but God
[47:33] is not bound by language time or
[47:35] distance and so if we were to say well
[47:37] if the Lord would come tonight and
[47:39] someone might say well if he's coming
[47:40] did he leave in time did he are they
[47:43] blasting on I-17 tonight is he going to
[47:45] get stopped you know is he what is he
[47:47] driving in does he have enough gas well
[47:48] God doesn't when God when he comes and a
[47:50] spirit comes it's not that God has to
[47:52] travel some great distance but when we
[47:55] think of it coming we immediately start
[47:56] thinking wow there's a Point of
[47:57] Departure there's a point of arrival
[47:59] that has to travel if you go somewhere
[48:01] you cover distance and in order to cover
[48:03] distance cover time
[48:05] right but God doesn't work that way
[48:07] that's not the way that God is so these
[48:10] are dispensations manifestations that's
[48:12] why we use a language to try to describe
[48:13] them and sometimes we have to we really
[48:16] need the Revelation to catch what it
[48:18] means and so when brother bear says the
[48:19] seventh angels on Earth at the time of
[48:21] this coming you know to use a language
[48:23] that we could understand what's
[48:25] transpiring is that those things that
[48:28] were sealed up for the end time the
[48:30] Salvation that was being held back
[48:31] waiting for the last days to be revealed
[48:33] the open of those seals reveals to us
[48:36] who Jesus Christ it is the revelation of
[48:39] Jesus Christ that brings the grace the
[48:41] Capstone comes crying Grace Grace
[48:43] salvation has been brought to us at the
[48:46] revelation of Jesus Christ in this end
[48:48] time
[48:49] that is the bride's salvation
[48:51] that is the bride's rejoicing not a
[48:54] repeat or return to Pentecost but it is
[48:56] the Christ that brought those disciples
[48:59] to their Pentecost it's the same Christ
[49:01] bringing us to our Capstone in the end
[49:06] so have you ever pondered it
[49:08] I don't know where we are in the Ponder
[49:10] bingo
[49:11] but have you ever pondered the last very
[49:13] last statement in the church age book do
[49:16] you know what it is anybody know what
[49:17] the very very you can I guess you can
[49:19] Google it if you want
[49:21] but the very last statement of the
[49:23] churches book
[49:25] remember brother bran preaches the
[49:26] breach
[49:28] it's between the seven Church ages and
[49:30] the Seven Seals and his book on the
[49:33] seven Church ages ends with this phrase
[49:34] in the statement
[49:36] and may his coming
[49:38] Rejoice your heart
[49:41] isn't that beautiful
[49:43] and may his coming Rejoice your heart
[49:46] why because there's something that his
[49:48] ministry introduced us to there's
[49:49] something that's restored back to us in
[49:52] the message of the hour that is Christ
[49:55] that is our cause of rejoicing
[49:58] I know there's people that have made it
[49:59] cultish I know there's some people that
[50:01] heard it this way and lean further this
[50:03] way lean further this way but it's
[50:05] nothing other than the truth of Christ
[50:07] revealed in this scripture being
[50:09] restored back to the his people to know
[50:12] him in his reality to gnome and his
[50:14] nature to gnome and his character to
[50:17] settle the sin question to empower us to
[50:19] Rise Above All The Temptations of
[50:20] laodicea to put us in the track that we
[50:23] can rise above uh the the all the things
[50:26] in the word in the world so that the
[50:28] word can give faith and and energy to
[50:30] our wings to finally triumph over death
[50:33] I know there's a way we can make it
[50:34] weird but you know what it just is
[50:36] different on its own as it is there's no
[50:39] reason we should try to make it weird
[50:40] and try to make it different it is in
[50:42] its reality it is in its truth and it's
[50:45] something that's precious to us and
[50:46] brother about him that's what he ends
[50:49] this church age but with may his coming
[50:50] Rejoice your heart that is our rejoicing
[50:53] in our cause of joy
[50:55] as Paul writes in first Thessalonians 2
[50:57] 19 he says for what is our hope our joy
[51:01] or crown of rejoicing what is it
[51:04] what is your hope your joy or crown of
[51:06] rejoicing
[51:08] and he says are not even ye in the
[51:10] presence of our Lord Jesus Christ it is
[51:12] coming
[51:13] in other words what is it what is it
[51:15] you're looking to
[51:17] for your happiness what is it you're
[51:19] looking to in his presence is the
[51:20] fullness of joy is what the scripture
[51:22] teaches us he says what is it what's our
[51:24] hope what's our joy what's our crown of
[51:26] rejoicing and he asks this question as a
[51:28] way of sinter and our joy on Christ he
[51:30] says are you not in the presence of our
[51:32] Lord Jesus Christ that is coming
[51:34] it's his presence that his presence is
[51:36] our joy
[51:38] his presence is our strength that's
[51:40] presence not with it ents
[51:44] it's a different presence but that's our
[51:45] joy
[51:47] the brothers if they'd come to their
[51:48] instruments
[51:49] my last statement here this evening from
[51:51] the sermon broken cisterns
[51:53] it's a sermon that there's a lot you can
[51:55] pull from
[51:57] on this subject
[51:59] he says why don't you turn to him
[52:03] where God is our abundant supply of joy
[52:06] our abundant Supply and praise
[52:10] our abundant Supply and satisfaction
[52:13] the calmness of my nerves comes from God
[52:18] when I'm tore up I find my satisfaction
[52:20] in Christ
[52:21] not in a cigarette not on the things of
[52:24] the world not enjoying some Creed
[52:28] but in finding him
[52:31] there's so many things that are offered
[52:32] to us these days it may not be a
[52:34] cigarette it could just be a lavender
[52:35] bath right
[52:37] it may not be in the things of the world
[52:39] it's just this the respite I just need
[52:42] to watch a movie to let off some esteem
[52:44] or I want to I want to go golfing I need
[52:46] to go fishing and I want to do this
[52:48] there's all sorts of ways that we're
[52:49] looking for some sort of recreation to
[52:51] calm our nerves they just need to do
[52:53] something to calm my nerves he says the
[52:54] calmness of my nerves comes from God I
[52:57] find my satisfaction in Christ not in
[52:59] cigarettes not in the things of the
[53:00] world not enjoying some Creed but notice
[53:02] how he phrases this but in finding him
[53:04] the promised word that he said if I go
[53:08] away I'll come again to receive you
[53:11] I find my joy in that
[53:14] that's a statement I find my joy in that
[53:17] he is my joy
[53:21] find your joy in the promised word
[53:24] I would take a promise of God
[53:27] and
[53:28] tie myself to it if I was you
[53:31] and what better promises to tie yourself
[53:34] to than the ones that are being
[53:35] fulfilled right now
[53:39] think about this this very scripture
[53:41] even as we go into Sunday morning
[53:42] service on Sunday he says if I go away
[53:45] I'll come again to receive you
[53:48] he comes a second time to catch his
[53:50] bride away he comes second as a Rapture
[53:53] to take his bride away he comes now as
[53:54] king he's looking for his Queen
[53:57] he comes
[53:58] [Music]
[53:59] to receive
[54:02] and he says I find my joy in that
[54:07] let's find our joy in that can we stand
[54:09] tonight
[54:09] [Music]
