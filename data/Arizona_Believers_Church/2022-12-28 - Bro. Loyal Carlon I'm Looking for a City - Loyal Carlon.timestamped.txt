[0:00] Jehovah Jireh 1962. now Abraham was
[0:03] looking for a city whose Builder and
[0:05] maker was God and today we are Pilgrim
[0:09] strangers looking for a city whose
[0:12] Builder and maker is God look Abraham
[0:15] before he had ever known there was
[0:18] something like an instinct in him that
[0:20] he looked at the city today passing down
[0:23] with the wife I was saying a lovely
[0:26] little place here sitting on the hill
[0:28] maybe 300 hundred years ago beautiful
[0:31] wood great High Timbers man come in they
[0:34] cut them down polluting the streams it
[0:37] would be a beautiful place to live here
[0:38] yeah but you look he built houses then
[0:42] he began to multiply sin and violence
[0:44] begin to come in Hollywood moved in
[0:46] close to him brought it in by movie by
[0:49] television and now it's contaminated
[0:51] sinful every city and surely as people
[0:55] some things in them likes to live
[0:57] together to neighbor and to be right
[1:00] righteous there is surely a city
[1:02] somewhere the Deep calling deep again
[1:06] and then from 64 questions and answer
[1:09] answers I just give anything this
[1:12] morning if I had a place here on Earth
[1:14] that I could go and say this is home if
[1:18] I had it I'd give a million dollars if I
[1:21] had a place that I could say boy I just
[1:24] love this so well I don't want to leave
[1:27] it no more I'd give anything but I can't
[1:30] find it I'm some something like Abraham
[1:33] was I'm looking for a city see I can't
[1:37] find it but I know it's there but I
[1:40] certainly can't get adjusted to any
[1:42] certain place on this Earth it just
[1:44] don't look like fine people fine places
[1:47] and you go here it's too wet you go out
[1:50] there it's too dry go up here it's too
[1:53] cold go down there it's too hot see
[1:56] there's no place it just stayed home
[2:00] and it's funny actually looking at this
[2:03] for myself I'm from Minnesota I lived in
[2:06] Tennessee for about two years I've lived
[2:08] here for about two years and I can say
[2:10] that this is true
[2:11] in Minnesota it's way too cold out in in
[2:14] the east coast it's way too wet it's
[2:16] kind of wet pretty much all the time
[2:18] it's always raining something like that
[2:19] coming in off the ocean there and out
[2:22] here it's definitely too hot except for
[2:24] tonight for some reason it's typically
[2:26] too hot and it's it's we're constantly
[2:29] oscillating and swinging through these
[2:32] seasons and times and shifts we go
[2:35] through this in the earth in the natural
[2:36] state of the Earth but then we also go
[2:38] through these things in our lives there
[2:41] are times and Seasons that we go through
[2:43] both on a on a large scale right when
[2:45] you're a kid you're in a springtime it's
[2:48] time to plant seeds it's time to grow
[2:49] it's time to listen it's time to be
[2:51] watered and you're in a spring time of
[2:53] your life no one really expects you to
[2:55] be bearing fruit when you're a kid at
[2:58] the end of the day your job is to learn
[2:59] your job is to grow but you start to get
[3:02] into your mid-20s maybe into your 30s
[3:04] into the summer of your life people
[3:06] expect to see some growth after a while
[3:08] it's the time to be where growth should
[3:11] have been taken taking place some
[3:12] branches are spreading out you're able
[3:14] to get some shade from this tree there's
[3:16] some strength in that growth and then of
[3:19] course we know after summer comes fall
[3:21] there should be some fruit in this tree
[3:23] there should be some fruit in this life
[3:25] going into 40s and 50s there should be
[3:27] depending on the decisions that were
[3:30] made when we were younger
[3:32] there's fruit
[3:34] that comes forth and then of course we
[3:36] know after fall comes winter and we can
[3:39] think of more of the retirement season
[3:41] where we're living off of those stores
[3:43] that the life has lived that's the
[3:45] Harvest that has been reaped from a what
[3:48] a life well lived
[3:50] but then we also see in the spiritual
[3:52] levels we see seasons and times that we
[3:55] all go through there are some times that
[3:58] are drier than others there are times
[4:00] that are wetter than others there are
[4:02] times where it just seems like
[4:03] everything is going perfect and when
[4:06] those times come we tend I don't know
[4:08] about you but for me I'm always like yes
[4:10] I finally made it
[4:12] I finally made it and then what do you
[4:15] know
[4:16] then we go back into another season
[4:19] dryness or wetness or whatever here we
[4:24] have no continuing City though we would
[4:28] think to know it though we would think
[4:29] to hold on to it even the Bible says any
[4:32] man that that thinks he stands take heed
[4:35] lest he fall why because we are are
[4:39] constantly
[4:41] we know Jesus talked about the parable
[4:43] of the the two houses one's built on
[4:46] Sand and one's built upon the rock sand
[4:48] a sifting sand the sand is a metaphor
[4:51] for man for mankind man's ideas if we're
[4:56] building our house our foundation of Our
[4:58] Lives upon man we're always going to be
[5:01] shifting back and forth that's always
[5:03] going to be this thing than that thing
[5:05] there's always going to be something
[5:08] um moving us in a sense
[5:10] but if we can drill down to the Rock
[5:13] and build our life upon the rock it the
[5:16] rock of God's word never moves it's
[5:19] always steadfast we're able to count on
[5:22] that and to trust in that
[5:26] 1953 expectancy look at the Indians when
[5:29] we first come here why they were
[5:31] worshiping Sun they were worshiping
[5:33] totem poles and everything there was
[5:35] something in them that knowed there was
[5:37] a maker somewhere all human beings know
[5:41] somewhere they've worshiped images and
[5:43] beasts and everything but they know
[5:45] there's a maker somewhere what is it
[5:47] they're thirsting for God there's bound
[5:50] to be a truth and a god somewhere to
[5:53] respond to that thirst not long ago when
[5:56] a church began to get a little different
[5:57] formal and cold many of you Full Gospel
[5:59] people you couldn't stand that you
[6:01] started craving and thirsting after more
[6:04] of God and if you're thirsting for more
[6:06] of God there's got to be more of God to
[6:09] respond to that thirst or you'd never
[6:12] have that thirst
[6:15] Something in My Redeemer Lives liveth
[6:17] something down in the human soul is
[6:19] crying out for something they can't find
[6:22] the Deep calling to the Deep
[6:26] I uh wanted to just throw in here
[6:30] just a little bit of a testimony and I
[6:32] don't
[6:33] I don't know I just felt led to go in
[6:35] this direction so y'all pray for me and
[6:37] bear with me
[6:39] about 11 years ago and it's it's around
[6:41] this time of year a bunch of kids are
[6:43] going to Winnie the treat right now it's
[6:44] a beautiful time of year it's a great
[6:46] time I went for a number of years but 11
[6:49] years ago this week uh was Winnie the
[6:52] treat and there were
[6:55] um
[6:56] a youth camp as you do you're in your
[6:59] early 20s late teens you spend a lot of
[7:01] time together you have some great
[7:03] services and then typically there's an
[7:04] after party right everyone gets together
[7:06] they hang out at the time for young
[7:08] people to connect
[7:09] exchange Facebook back in the day I mean
[7:12] that's kind of the way it went and there
[7:14] were a bunch of us
[7:17] um that had 50 people to send out a
[7:20] house let's put it that way 50 people
[7:22] descended on this tiny little house
[7:23] somewhere in Michigan or Ohio I can't
[7:25] remember
[7:26] and I just remember brother Aaron
[7:29] actually preached at those services and
[7:31] it was a beautiful time like we had one
[7:33] of the most beautiful times of communion
[7:35] and I remember we all showed up at this
[7:38] house and we kind of broke into groups
[7:40] like there was a group playing games
[7:42] there was a group that went off on a
[7:43] walk there was a group downstairs
[7:44] playing other games and then there was a
[7:46] group of us that ended up in this small
[7:48] room almost like a closet there was a
[7:51] wall a false wall that you could just
[7:53] kind of pull over this little like 10 by
[7:55] 10 foot room and there was 10 of us in
[7:57] there and
[7:59] we were just kind of ended up finding
[8:02] each other the people that really wanted
[8:04] to talk about the service like really
[8:06] like we just we there was a
[8:09] there was a need to go a little bit
[8:12] further
[8:13] than just the services than just the
[8:15] thought just to go a little bit deeper
[8:18] and I remember I was fortunate enough to
[8:20] be in that group and I just remember we
[8:23] were talking about God and
[8:26] there there was
[8:30] it's so
[8:32] I just want to take you on a little bit
[8:33] of a journey tonight because I I felt to
[8:35] bring this it's been 11 years and it was
[8:37] this week and I was just thinking about
[8:38] this this
[8:42] event is where things changed for me
[8:46] having grown up in and around the
[8:48] message you know you have you go through
[8:51] seasons and periods I was for myself and
[8:53] again I don't know why I'm going down
[8:55] this maybe it's for the young people but
[8:56] baptized when I was 12 years old you
[8:59] know grew up my dad was a song leader I
[9:01] was best friends with the pastor's son
[9:02] you know you're very clean cut
[9:05] stereotypical christian-born kid you
[9:08] know that's that's the thing and then
[9:09] you know you go through your teenage
[9:11] crises and you think you're just the
[9:13] worst person ever and like all this
[9:14] stuff God really got a hold of my life
[9:16] again when I was 18.
[9:18] and I felt like I was in a really good
[9:21] place with God in a lot of ways and yet
[9:23] here we are I'm I think 22 whenever this
[9:26] came about 11 years ago yeah I guess I'm
[9:28] 33 there we go
[9:30] um you forget as you get older I guess I
[9:33] can say that now right
[9:36] anyways but we were in this this room
[9:39] and I just remember
[9:42] I'm there you know here I for me I feel
[9:44] like I've already got a walk with god
[9:46] I've already spent a lot of you know
[9:48] I've dedicated I was already a worship
[9:50] leader at my church I was already
[9:51] running a Bible study like for me it was
[9:54] I'm in a really good place as far as
[9:56] anyone else knows and yet somehow deep
[9:59] inside I remember that whole sequence of
[10:03] services I remember I was wrestling
[10:05] inside of myself with this idea of what
[10:08] if this is all just a joke like what if
[10:10] it's not even real like what if it's all
[10:12] I think having been someone who like I
[10:16] read a lot I've always been a voracious
[10:18] leader reader having read a lot of books
[10:21] having really like dug in in college and
[10:23] a lot of different things
[10:26] it it
[10:27] becomes very easy to compare one thing
[10:31] to something else
[10:33] it's very easy to compare the
[10:35] experiences that people have in one
[10:37] religion to another religion or that
[10:39] some people have in in maybe a emotional
[10:42] experience to another emotional
[10:44] experience I mean we know that this is
[10:46] true and in the secular Christian world
[10:49] it's basically a rock concert it's kind
[10:52] of the same thing like I I've been to my
[10:55] fair share of shows I know what it's
[10:57] like I know what that atmosphere is like
[10:59] and where
[11:01] you know you have your altar call in a
[11:03] rock concert absolutely it's it's there
[11:05] are tenants that are very similar that
[11:07] are very parallel and so
[11:10] it's very hard when you've dug deep
[11:13] enough to start to divide that and the
[11:15] doubt can set in
[11:17] and so for me like I believed that this
[11:20] was true but I had it was almost like a
[11:23] palpable voice someone sitting on my
[11:25] shoulder like you don't believe any of
[11:27] this none of this is all nonsense
[11:29] but I I was hungering for something more
[11:32] for for something greater because I knew
[11:35] that there had to be and
[11:38] we all have our own testimonies and I
[11:40] guess I just want to share this because
[11:41] this was something very important for me
[11:43] and for several of us we were in this
[11:46] room
[11:47] um Chris take was there Nathan Erickson
[11:49] Zachary Wallace was there uh several
[11:51] different people from this area were
[11:53] there
[11:54] and
[11:55] we just we be like I don't know how long
[11:58] it was I don't know how many hours it
[11:59] was but we were talking about God and
[12:02] eventually like a like it was like a
[12:05] concentrated force of desire and we
[12:07] decided we're just going to pray now
[12:10] there's no ministers here it's a bunch
[12:12] of young people in a house in our early
[12:14] 20s there's no music there's nothing
[12:17] there's nothing to work someone up we're
[12:20] in this little room it's not very
[12:21] comfortable these like really bad little
[12:24] wooden chairs and we all just start
[12:27] praying and I remember in that like you
[12:29] you just felt the room
[12:31] charge and then someone started speaking
[12:34] in tongues and someone started
[12:36] prophesying and in that moment the room
[12:40] blew up it was it was weird I know for
[12:42] myself it was like a scream came out of
[12:45] me that I'd never like it wasn't me it
[12:47] was weird and that voice left whatever
[12:50] it was for me left and it hasn't come
[12:53] back which is it thanked the Lord for
[12:55] that like it it left now I've gone
[12:58] through my season since then but I never
[13:00] there's a lock there it's like a wall
[13:04] P that that what ended up happening was
[13:06] someone of that they heard us screaming
[13:09] in there and they they pulled the false
[13:11] wall back and eventually just like blew
[13:13] up into the rest of the room people were
[13:14] downstairs playing games they hear us
[13:16] upstairs like running around and you
[13:18] know it just enveloped the place
[13:20] and I mean we started praying for people
[13:23] people were healed like we were it was
[13:25] amazing people that had gone on the walk
[13:27] a friend of mine Jared meat he goes to
[13:29] brother um Paul off maintains her she's
[13:31] a minister now he said he was walking
[13:33] around outside
[13:36] as a part of the group and he looks
[13:37] through the window they were coming back
[13:39] and he saw people running around in
[13:41] circles with their eyes closed and he
[13:43] thought that they were playing games and
[13:45] so he goes running into the house and
[13:46] he's like we're playing games you know
[13:49] and he said for him it was like when he
[13:52] went in the door he hit a brick wall
[13:54] like oh something stopped him from going
[13:57] in the door because it
[14:00] his Spirit wasn't in the same Union as
[14:03] the spirit that was going on in there
[14:05] and my sister was a part of that group
[14:07] as well she can testify to the same
[14:09] thing
[14:09] and so they they prayed outside and they
[14:12] slowly entered in and
[14:16] it went on for five six hours like this
[14:20] the police started circling the building
[14:22] literally there were police that were
[14:24] coming down and
[14:27] um
[14:29] long story short like we we
[14:33] something happened something happened
[14:36] that you can't explain
[14:38] that I couldn't explain
[14:40] and the Beautiful Thing is we all a lot
[14:43] of us ended up going to Paul off on
[14:44] teen's Church the next day which was
[14:46] happened to be Sunday and the same thing
[14:48] happened again where all of a sudden it
[14:50] just broke out I'm sure you're over
[14:52] there you remember Michael like it was a
[14:55] beautiful thing all of a sudden just
[14:56] this spilling out of the spirit and the
[14:59] power of almighty God
[15:01] and
[15:09] to me and to those of us that were there
[15:12] now not everyone not not everyone
[15:14] connected the dots but to me it was the
[15:18] first time I saw something real
[15:21] real having grown up around this thing
[15:24] where you're taught the tenets of Faith
[15:28] taught you know you get baptized you
[15:30] know seeking the Holy Ghost I know
[15:32] what's right and wrong I know these
[15:34] things but I needed something that was
[15:37] real
[15:38] because if we're looking at just the the
[15:41] tenets of the faith I mean really if you
[15:43] look at it we could all go be Buddhists
[15:45] and would actually be pretty good people
[15:46] like if you go look at it like they're
[15:48] not that bad we could all become like
[15:51] and again that's that's a broad kind of
[15:53] smoothing it over but if we're just if
[15:57] we're just coming to Christianity for a
[16:00] better way of living
[16:02] then it's vanity
[16:05] it's just vanity it's just another way
[16:08] of living
[16:09] and
[16:10] we've got to have something real today
[16:15] we've got to have something real for
[16:18] today I was just thinking about this it
[16:20] may have been 11 years since that event
[16:22] but it's just as real and alive today
[16:25] it's just as real and I I can say for
[16:28] myself I think in the years of of Trials
[16:32] and struggles since then as Satan has
[16:34] attacked me and many of us that were
[16:36] there I I can attest for several of them
[16:39] that I've talked to since and they've
[16:41] all said the same thing that even though
[16:43] like the attack of the enemy has come we
[16:46] can never it can never cross that line
[16:49] there's a memorial for each one of us
[16:51] back to that time where God made himself
[16:55] real
[16:56] not just a hype up not just a fanaticism
[16:59] not just an emotional time
[17:02] and
[17:03] my my reason for bringing it up isn't
[17:06] like oh yeah look at this great time
[17:07] that I had and now you guys need to go
[17:09] find a room somewhere and now you can go
[17:11] figure it out like that's not the point
[17:13] the point being is that
[17:17] for each one of us
[17:20] there's a thirst for God
[17:23] there is a craving and a desire for God
[17:27] and God put that desire in there
[17:32] and if God put the desire in there he
[17:35] owes it to us to satisfy that desire if
[17:40] there is a deep calling then there must
[17:42] be a deep to respond
[17:45] there must be and I think even even
[17:49] as we age and we grow more mature in the
[17:53] faith again we're going into those
[17:54] Seasons those seasons of summertime
[17:57] those seasons of harvest that we might
[17:59] think in our lives you know I've already
[18:01] been walking with God I've already had
[18:03] those times with God
[18:05] he can do just the same today
[18:08] continuously that ever that ever present
[18:13] joyous stream is alive for us today we
[18:16] don't have to just be living in a
[18:19] testimony of days gone by but we can
[18:22] connect to him today in the now
[18:26] in today
[18:31] first 1965 you say I have a holy thirst
[18:34] I'm not guilty brother Branham and of
[18:37] just go and joining church and things
[18:39] like this but see to neglect a thirst if
[18:44] you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water
[18:48] or food you will die
[18:50] and if you neglect that thirst in you
[18:52] for God you will spiritually die
[18:56] you call for revivals you wait for your
[18:59] church to have a Revival well that ain't
[19:02] the Revival for you the Revival ought to
[19:05] begin right in you when you begin to
[19:08] thirst for God there might not be
[19:10] another member of that church wanting
[19:13] that Revival if it breaks out in you it
[19:16] will break out other places see
[19:20] praise the Lord
[19:23] it will break out
[19:25] in you
[19:28] as we're going into this next year this
[19:30] is the last service of this year going
[19:33] into another year
[19:34] and I was just thinking about the
[19:40] in some ways the futility
[19:43] of the perpetuity of life in a sense
[19:46] here comes another year we go by people
[19:49] make New Year's resolutions they aim
[19:51] like I'm going to try to get a raise
[19:52] this year or I'm going to lose some
[19:54] weight this year
[19:56] and there's a there's a futility to it
[20:00] all in some regards it as a metaphor if
[20:03] we clean the house we just have to clean
[20:06] the house again
[20:07] if we do the dishes we just have to do
[20:10] the dishes again if we eat a delicious
[20:12] meal we just have to eat a delicious
[20:14] meal again not complaining on that one
[20:17] but we do
[20:19] if we get a good night's sleep a perfect
[20:21] night's sleep we just have to sleep
[20:23] again
[20:24] if we take all of our vitamins if we
[20:27] shave whatever we just have to do it
[20:30] again it is this continuation
[20:35] of the cycle of life and the and as
[20:39] Ecclesiastes said it Ecclesiastes 4
[20:41] verse uh four again I considered all
[20:44] travail and every right work every right
[20:48] work this isn't bad works it's every
[20:50] right work that for this man is envied
[20:53] of his neighbor this is also vanity and
[20:55] vexation of spirit the fool full
[20:59] I can't say that word today folds his
[21:02] hands together and eats his own flesh
[21:04] betters and handful with quietness than
[21:07] both the hands full which her veil in a
[21:09] vexation of spirit then I returned and I
[21:12] saw vanity Under the Sun there is one
[21:15] alone and there is not a second yea he
[21:17] hath neither child nor brother yet is
[21:20] there no end of all his labor neither is
[21:23] his eye satisfied with riches thank you
[21:27] neither safety for whom do I labor and
[21:30] bereave my soul of good this is also
[21:33] vanity yea it is a sore travail
[21:39] 59 thirsting for Life some people things
[21:42] to make money that's life make money
[21:44] plenty of it
[21:46] amen I'm just kidding
[21:50] just kidding
[21:52] um some people thinks that they're young
[21:54] gaity and running out and dances and
[21:56] things cutting up carrying on immoral
[21:58] next morning with a headache heartache
[22:01] broke up homes that's not life that's
[22:04] death disguised that's the wolf in the
[22:06] sheep's clothes clothing that cannot be
[22:09] life that's death and the world is
[22:12] deceived by those things but the
[22:14] question is my brother sister tonight
[22:16] what makes men and women do that if
[22:19] they're mentally right what makes them
[22:21] do that what makes them crave to drink
[22:24] whiskey what makes the American people
[22:25] smoke cigarettes
[22:27] is because when God made a man he
[22:30] created him thus he made a man to thirst
[22:33] and there's a little place in the heart
[22:35] that nothing will fill it but God
[22:39] Jesus said blessed are they that do
[22:42] hunger and thirst for righteousness and
[22:45] it's God trying to get to a human heart
[22:48] the devil tries to quench that by
[22:50] letting them drink theirself to death or
[22:53] run themselves to death or something
[22:55] else but God created man to have that
[22:58] Holy thirst and if you won't take God
[23:01] you'll have to take something else to
[23:04] kind of appease that calling
[23:08] you'll have to take something else and I
[23:12] think of it today and
[23:14] in the Instagram social media age that
[23:17] we're in I just I don't know whatever I
[23:20] work in marketing and sales and I've
[23:22] just been I think about this all the
[23:24] time and it's terrible
[23:27] they say that when you work in a poison
[23:29] Factory you never want to drink your own
[23:31] product and it's kind of true if you
[23:32] work in marketing and sales you start to
[23:34] get this like wow everyone really is
[23:37] just like
[23:39] they're pushing a religion is what's
[23:41] actually happening we're pushing an
[23:43] ideal if it's not the the fitness
[23:46] lifestyle then it's the nutrition
[23:48] lifestyle if it's not the nutrition
[23:49] lifestyle then it's the gamer lifestyle
[23:51] if it's not the gamer lifestyle it's the
[23:54] car lifestyle that lifestyle becomes the
[23:58] religion becomes this ideal this
[24:02] Obsession the the thing that every
[24:04] weekend is spent thinking about and
[24:08] they're thirsting and again like I I
[24:10] think it's it's important to update this
[24:12] away from alcohol or denominations or
[24:16] drugs or you know uh going out to you
[24:19] know just like you know the club or
[24:21] whatever but updating it to the the
[24:23] anything again there's nothing wrong
[24:25] with having a nice car there's nothing
[24:27] wrong with working out there's nothing
[24:28] wrong with good nutrition or whatever
[24:30] but the moment that it becomes the
[24:33] substitute
[24:35] now we have a problem there is a problem
[24:38] and it's very often and we look at this
[24:41] if Satan can come with the word
[24:44] then certainly he can come with things
[24:46] that are good for us and pervert them
[24:49] into idolatry
[24:51] pervert them into taking the place of
[24:54] our love and our need and our desire for
[24:57] God
[24:58] I don't know about you but I've tried
[25:00] plenty of this like meditation like
[25:02] headspace mindfulness stuff sure it's
[25:05] great you know some of it's awesome I
[25:06] think it's really good but it will never
[25:08] take the place of a relationship with
[25:10] Christ it doesn't matter how much these
[25:13] people can say all you need is 10
[25:15] minutes a day of headspace and just take
[25:17] some deep breaths in and ah you know you
[25:20] know and even the Christian version of
[25:22] it the Christian version is you know if
[25:24] you look back into the roots of the
[25:26] Bible the word Isha or whatever it's
[25:28] like that's the word of God or Yahweh is
[25:30] it's the Breath of God and you know when
[25:33] we're breathing we're saying the name of
[25:34] God and like that stuff is beautiful but
[25:36] again it's not it is
[25:39] if put in the right place it's fine it's
[25:42] just like you know going and eating a
[25:44] good meal we all need to do that that's
[25:46] that's not a problem but the moment it
[25:48] becomes
[25:50] it's a very quick thing it's a very
[25:54] subtle thing where it shifts to self
[25:57] worship
[25:58] the worship of yourself the same thing
[26:01] again going back to working out or going
[26:03] back to nutrition these different things
[26:06] it can become this idea yes our body is
[26:09] a temple that's a scripture
[26:10] just saying we all got to go sign up for
[26:13] the gym January 1st Let's go people
[26:16] come on
[26:17] gotta get our numbers up um
[26:20] our body is a temple but if we're taking
[26:23] that in isolation then we create yeah
[26:25] our body is a temple to our own lusts
[26:28] and again not preaching against working
[26:30] out although those other things it's
[26:32] fine but we must keep it in Balance we
[26:35] must keep the main thing the main thing
[26:38] and we must not allow the
[26:43] we must not allow I love it the and I
[26:46] don't have it right in front of me but
[26:48] we'll just quote it is Jesus talked
[26:50] about the parable of the sower and how
[26:53] some some was um some of the seed was
[26:57] thrown onto you know rough brown or bad
[26:59] ground or whatever you know the birds
[27:01] come up and pluck it out
[27:03] but some fell on really good ground in
[27:06] fact it was so good that the weeds
[27:08] really liked growing there too
[27:11] and I think too frequently that's us if
[27:14] we're not maintaining that ground the
[27:17] weeds come in and if you look at it
[27:19] Jesus said it was the the cares of this
[27:22] life and the deceitfulness of riches
[27:24] came in and choked out the seed again it
[27:29] was good ground
[27:31] it was good ground and and if we look
[27:33] brother Branham talks about in uh a
[27:36] series on demonology he talked about
[27:38] many this is true it's an exact quote go
[27:41] look it up
[27:42] there are people who can be filled with
[27:44] the Holy Ghost and be totally insane
[27:49] because they've allowed their Spirit man
[27:52] their their body to become so possessed
[27:56] by the things of this life and the
[27:58] things of this world and of course we
[28:00] know that there's different mental
[28:01] illnesses not not shaming anyone for
[28:03] that but that the point being is that we
[28:06] if we are not careful we can allow even
[28:09] with the Holy Ghost we've been born
[28:11] again we can allow our spirits to become
[28:14] polluted with the things of the world
[28:16] and there is no longer the ability to
[28:19] bring forth fruit
[28:22] God help us
[28:27] Ecclesiastes 5 10. he that love is
[28:31] silver shall not be satisfied with
[28:33] silver nor he that loves abundance with
[28:36] increase this is also vanity I can just
[28:39] see you know what's funny I can see
[28:41] Solomon writing this and it's just like
[28:43] with his riches and with his wealth and
[28:46] he's just like man I got it all still
[28:50] not happy hashtag you know whatever like
[28:52] I mean that's that's the idea here
[28:55] really this is the idea
[28:58] this is the worst that's basically what
[29:00] he's saying updating it to modern
[29:02] language like sad face or angry face
[29:09] it's annoying to have labored for what
[29:12] you love and never being satisfied with
[29:15] that thing that you love I mean I'm sure
[29:18] we've all done it you get a new car yes
[29:21] this is the best two weeks later it's
[29:23] like
[29:23] picking at like something like under
[29:25] like you know like the seams and the
[29:27] leather whatever like we we start to
[29:29] there's it's our human nature we're
[29:32] going to find same thing with this
[29:33] building like when we moved out of the
[29:35] hotel it's like whoa yay oh my God it's
[29:38] so hot in here like it's the worst you
[29:41] know like immediately we're updating our
[29:44] need because we're humans we have no
[29:47] continuing City there's always going to
[29:50] be something that we're dissatisfied
[29:52] with as humans as as long as we are
[29:56] looking to the things of this Earth to
[29:59] satisfy us
[30:03] for here we have no continuing City but
[30:06] we seek one to come
[30:11] just remember brother we are looking for
[30:14] a city to come whose Builder and maker
[30:16] is God that's right we're looking for a
[30:18] kingdom to come it isn't Germany it
[30:20] isn't Switzerland it is in the United
[30:23] States
[30:24] it's Christ and the kingdom from above
[30:28] praise the Lord
[30:40] uh from and I'm watching the time here
[30:43] greater than Solomon is here
[30:45] uh speaking of the queen of Bathsheba
[30:47] that didn't satisfy her she said but sir
[30:51] speaking of the priests there in her
[30:53] country sir look they tell me that it is
[30:55] a living God dear look look at the gods
[30:58] that we have here yes that's right all
[31:01] the books and gods but I never seen
[31:03] nothing move in them grandma didn't see
[31:06] nothing moving them and her grandma
[31:08] didn't see nothing moving them they're
[31:10] nothing but a bunch of words
[31:12] they're nothing but a bunch of idols
[31:19] but they tell me that is a living God
[31:22] who lives in human beings and I want to
[31:25] see something real bless her little
[31:28] heart I want to see something that's got
[31:31] some life to it not a dead Idol not a
[31:34] dead formal theology
[31:41] we've got to have something real we've
[31:44] got to and I think that I'm just going
[31:46] to drop this in here because I felt
[31:48] we've got a wonderful Church we've got
[31:51] great word we've got great worship we
[31:53] have people that love the Lord and if we
[31:56] stop there it's all in vain
[31:59] it's all in vain the the the and you see
[32:03] this I've seen this before in other
[32:05] churches that I've been in and I again
[32:07] I'm not saying we're getting it here but
[32:09] it's something we should be aware of the
[32:11] moment we start thinking wow man that
[32:14] was a great service
[32:16] we we're it like I got like where we got
[32:19] it that moment is the moment we're no
[32:22] longer we're not receiving from God
[32:24] which comes back to this idea of
[32:26] self-worship and if you look at this
[32:28] this is a continuum
[32:31] any time and again I love brother Aaron
[32:35] I love him but if we start lifting him
[32:38] up it's like brother Aaron you got wow
[32:40] whoa
[32:42] so amazing God will come in and he will
[32:45] make sure that we get our eyes back on
[32:47] Christ he will make sure because God
[32:50] isn't going to share his glory with
[32:52] anyone
[32:53] he will make sure that that happens and
[32:55] so it is is vital and again Pastor
[32:58] appreciation believe in all that it's
[32:59] very important it's great but we must
[33:02] make sure we're focusing on Christ we're
[33:04] looking through the ministry to Christ
[33:07] we must get a hold of God it's not
[33:12] enough to have read the Bible multiple
[33:15] times to memorize again
[33:18] there are people who will beat us at
[33:20] every single one of those things
[33:21] memorizing the word of God studying it
[33:25] voraciously
[33:28] but Jesus talked about a way
[33:32] that a fool would an air in it there's a
[33:35] scripture and I'm don't have it in my
[33:36] notes this is totally off the cuff
[33:38] the think about that that there is a way
[33:42] that someone who is not able to
[33:44] comprehend it intellectually can still
[33:47] get a hold of God
[33:49] they're not able to put all the quotes
[33:52] or the scriptures together and like wow
[33:54] I really got this deep Revelation right
[33:57] and yet they
[34:00] if they're a child of God they won't
[34:02] miss it they won't miss it God help us
[34:06] to have that level of humility to be
[34:09] able to lay off our intellectual crowns
[34:12] and say God I need you I need you
[34:16] because it is the very things that we
[34:18] think we know that may be keeping us
[34:21] from a closer walk with God
[34:24] we know so much
[34:27] we know so much honestly what it often
[34:30] creates is spiritual obesity we know so
[34:34] much oh so good
[34:36] when's the last time you exercised your
[34:38] faith when's the last time you were able
[34:41] to bring it into your life at the end of
[34:45] the day and again we're not even talking
[34:46] about it's not about the signs and the
[34:49] Wonders and jumping up and down and
[34:51] screaming though those things are
[34:52] awesome and I love them I love it but it
[34:55] is in our day today grind just down into
[35:00] this the weeds of life
[35:03] and I love it God Jesus said he would
[35:07] never leave us
[35:09] never forsake us so the days we don't
[35:12] feel like Christ is there those are the
[35:15] days
[35:16] that's the reason Jesus said that
[35:19] because he knew most days we'd probably
[35:22] think he's not there
[35:24] right but he is there not because we can
[35:27] feel him but because he said he would be
[35:30] he would be there in the middle of our
[35:33] muck and our mire and our our our own
[35:37] Frailty I love it says in Psalms David
[35:40] wrote you remember we're butt dust
[35:45] he remembers we're just dust you know we
[35:49] tend to think we put so much pressure on
[35:51] ourselves that we got to have this whole
[35:53] thing figured out we have to have
[35:55] everything just so and then you know
[35:58] once I'm going good for 30 days then I'm
[36:00] gonna be you know it takes 30 days to
[36:03] build a habit and then once I'm there
[36:04] then God will accept me
[36:07] then I'll be like a favored child of God
[36:10] look at me
[36:15] or if we don't think that we definitely
[36:17] think the opposite of that I've been
[36:20] doing really bad for the last 30 days
[36:22] I'm definitely way down here I'm just
[36:25] you know
[36:26] don't look at me God you know wait until
[36:29] I know friends I have friends who grew
[36:32] up around the around the message and
[36:33] around Christianity
[36:35] that have basically said
[36:39] I don't I can't
[36:43] I can't come to church I can't come do
[36:45] these things because I know I can't live
[36:47] it
[36:48] and they're right
[36:51] and neither can you neither can I
[36:55] and but yet we think we're supposed to
[36:58] we do I'm not the only one
[37:02] we think we're supposed to oh God don't
[37:04] worry yeah you saved me I got it from
[37:06] here get off like go
[37:09] I got it from here but that I think that
[37:12] the the human walk and again this idea
[37:14] of there is no continuing City
[37:17] it is too
[37:19] make sure we are always in a position
[37:21] where we need God
[37:24] we are always in a position where we
[37:28] where we can look to him and as long as
[37:31] we can get our eyes off of the hand of
[37:34] man off of Our Own
[37:36] ability to save ourselves is the moment
[37:39] that we stop trying to save ourselves
[37:42] that God can actually come in and do
[37:45] something in our lives is the moment
[37:50] Psalms 84 verse 2.
[37:53] my soul longest yay even fainteth for
[37:57] the courts of the Lord my heart and of
[38:00] My Flesh cryeth out for the Living God
[38:03] yea the sparrow hath found in house and
[38:06] the swallow a nest for herself where she
[38:08] may lay her young even thine altars O
[38:10] Lord of hosts my king and my God
[38:13] blessed are they that dwell in thy house
[38:15] they will still be praising they blessed
[38:18] is the man whose strength is in thee in
[38:21] whose heart are the ways of them
[38:24] for a day in thy courts is better than a
[38:26] thousand
[38:28] I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house
[38:30] of God than to dwell in the tents of
[38:32] wickedness
[38:37] 1956 at kadish barnia
[38:39] talking about Moses and in the face of
[38:42] that burning bush that day he received
[38:45] an experience that stayed with him as
[38:48] long as he lived and as I said last
[38:51] night so I say today that man no matter
[38:54] how good Moses was taught how much
[38:57] theology he knowed how good a church
[38:59] member he was and how good a teacher
[39:01] mother he was brought up under and every
[39:04] precept of Education that could be
[39:06] brought he was a King's son but he's
[39:09] still trying in himself
[39:12] failed to make it go over
[39:14] but in five minutes in the presence of
[39:17] the burning bush he became a new person
[39:19] something happened and what we need
[39:23] today in our seminaries it's not so much
[39:25] theology to be taught but a burning bush
[39:28] experience where men get down before God
[39:31] and meet him face to face we need a
[39:34] challenger today like we had in that day
[39:36] what we need is a man and woman who has
[39:39] met God and know what they're talking
[39:42] about not somebody trying to teach from
[39:45] some church book or some open theology
[39:47] what we need today is a man that's been
[39:50] in the presence of a burning bush has
[39:52] been born again and changed and made a
[39:56] new creature
[39:58] and I was thinking about this
[40:02] I love this testifying
[40:06] think about and again secular
[40:08] Christianity has taught us that
[40:09] testifying is going out and talking to
[40:11] someone and saying here's the 10 steps
[40:13] to Salvation now if you want to come
[40:15] down to my church we'll get you hooked
[40:16] up that's testifying testifying really
[40:20] though if you think about the compound
[40:22] meaning of that word is
[40:25] a testimonial of an experience I was
[40:29] there I saw it this happened I was there
[40:35] and it's the the you can't testify
[40:39] unless you've seen something
[40:42] God help us have less less of this and
[40:47] more of this drilling down with our own
[40:51] lives to God we need it I need it we all
[40:55] need it
[40:57] we've got to have an experience with God
[41:02] it's what we need it's what our young
[41:04] people need it's what this church needs
[41:07] we need we must have and again I think
[41:11] we often conflate it's very easy to kind
[41:13] of move this into oh we need to have a
[41:15] time of just crying and everyone needs
[41:16] to be shouting or something it's like
[41:18] maybe
[41:19] but at the end of the day when something
[41:21] happens you'll know you will know
[41:25] from that time there the something
[41:29] happened something happened and we need
[41:33] it
[41:41] Matthew 6 33 but seek ye first the
[41:44] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[41:46] all these things shall be added unto you
[41:49] and I love this and I believe brother
[41:51] Aaron has touched on this before as well
[41:52] the definition of the word seek and
[41:54] there's a couple of compound meanings
[41:55] but one of them if you go back to the
[41:57] original text the word actually means to
[42:01] Crave to demand something from someone
[42:05] to seek Him First for even the uh idea
[42:09] of first is of utmost importance this
[42:13] idea of demanding like I have got to
[42:16] have this I've got to have this I have
[42:19] must have the kingdom of God and all
[42:22] these things will be added unto us
[42:25] Jeremiah 29
[42:27] and yeesh verse 13 and ye shall seek me
[42:30] and find me when ye shall search for me
[42:32] with all your heart
[42:35] with all your heart not a partial
[42:39] surrender or a partial idea or again
[42:43] even even
[42:45] I think it's so easy to to have walked
[42:49] with God and get
[42:51] used to a walk with God it's like oh
[42:55] well this is just kind of the way life
[42:56] is now you know I just come to church on
[42:59] Sunday and come to church on Wednesday
[43:00] and you know I read my Bible sometimes
[43:02] and I pray sometimes you know like
[43:05] or we get into a routine we get into a
[43:08] habit of serving God those things are
[43:10] fine nothing against them but our faith
[43:13] is not built in our habits and our
[43:15] rituals and our routines our faith is
[43:18] not built and how well we are doing
[43:20] right now
[43:21] our faith is not is not in in our
[43:24] environment or the people that we are
[43:26] around our faith must be solely In
[43:30] Christ Alone
[43:31] must be solely aimed at Christ we can
[43:35] think of this in the way that we look
[43:36] like we we must be looking unto Christ
[43:44] 1957 uh the greatest gift in the Bible
[43:47] that's the way my soul thirsts for thee
[43:50] Oh I must have you Lord or I'll perish
[43:53] if you only knew sinner friend that the
[43:55] hounds of hell is right behind you
[43:57] crippled and wounded by sin you've got
[44:00] to find Christ or perish when that sort
[44:03] of a desire gets into a man's heart he
[44:06] will find Christ when you get in that
[44:09] shape as the heart paneth for the water
[44:11] Brook I must have it I'm wounded if I
[44:15] don't have it I'm I'm gone
[44:19] I'm gone
[44:21] and
[44:22] this is the place of true surrender
[44:27] surrendering is not
[44:30] a thought it's not a word it's an action
[44:33] it's something we do
[44:36] it isn't oh you know I love the song I
[44:38] surrender all it's not I surrender all
[44:40] like that's a great song we should sing
[44:41] it after this it's a great song but it
[44:44] that is a profession not an action
[44:48] true surrender is when God's got you in
[44:51] a headlock
[44:52] and there is no choice but to tap out
[44:57] life's got you you don't got it you
[45:00] don't have it and it is in that moment
[45:02] we must call upon the Lord and let go
[45:07] and that's where trust comes in and I'm
[45:09] watching the time we're coming to a
[45:10] close shortly
[45:12] trust is faith in action we sit on
[45:16] chairs tonight because we believe that
[45:19] it will hold us
[45:21] most of us I'm just kidding they'll
[45:24] trust we trust that the chair will hold
[45:27] us
[45:28] and a lot of the times the reason we
[45:30] don't surrender to Christ is because we
[45:32] don't really trust him
[45:35] we say we do we might even want to
[45:38] but we don't
[45:40] the Bible says to come boldly before the
[45:43] throne of grace that you might obtain
[45:45] mercy and I love brother Aaron brought
[45:48] it out the other day that the word
[45:49] boldly really means honestly come
[45:54] honestly before the throne of grace that
[45:56] you might obtain Mercy that God I don't
[45:59] have it you know I think sometimes it's
[46:01] almost harder when you
[46:04] believe yourself to be a Christian
[46:07] it's almost harder to get down and tell
[46:10] God I don't have this
[46:13] I don't have I don't have enough faith
[46:16] for this I don't know if I do
[46:18] but being honest with God about where we
[46:21] are because again the faith if we lack
[46:24] Faith Bible said if the if you lack
[46:27] Wisdom ask God
[46:29] everything we need comes from God we
[46:32] don't need to we put on our masks with
[46:34] each other
[46:36] as humans we put on masks we put on
[46:39] personas like hey I'm a great person
[46:42] and inside we know that that's not
[46:45] that's just nonsense
[46:47] even when we are doing great some part
[46:49] of us somewhere is like man
[46:51] I don't know if I am doing great some
[46:54] part of us
[46:55] and we can bring that before God without
[46:59] the fear of judgment without the fear of
[47:02] rejection without the fear of criticism
[47:05] without without the father looking down
[47:08] and saying yeah you are messed up
[47:11] um
[47:13] the story of the prodigal son is so
[47:16] beautiful it's so beautiful here's the
[47:18] prodigal son he's the son
[47:21] he's been given wealth riches goes and
[47:24] squatters it goes and does just the you
[47:26] know he's doing cocaine like I mean he's
[47:28] just he's not a good guy he is not a
[47:30] great son
[47:32] and yet here he is coming back ready
[47:37] he's totally abased he's ready to just
[47:39] be a servant
[47:42] and yet he's not even able to get it out
[47:45] of his mouth before the father says
[47:48] we're throwing a party I'm so glad
[47:51] you're back I'm so glad to see you we're
[47:55] gonna have some barbecue and some steaks
[47:57] and some brisket I mean that's what it
[47:59] is we're throwing a party
[48:02] and that is the same love that Christ
[48:05] has for us
[48:07] as Sons even as people who know better
[48:21] coming into a close
[48:24] uh musicians can go ahead and come
[48:31] you say if you would have lived in the
[48:34] days of Jesus I would have done so and
[48:36] so
[48:37] why you are living in his days
[48:41] you are
[48:44] if you're looking for him you'll find
[48:47] him he's here there's a fountain open
[48:50] tonight brother when a man hunger and
[48:53] thirst for God there's bound to be
[48:55] something in there to create that thirst
[49:01] foreign
[49:04] and I guess as we come to the close of
[49:07] this year
[49:10] and I I guess I would extend this out to
[49:11] all of us
[49:13] if you're thirsting for God
[49:15] there's a fountain open tonight
[49:18] sometimes I think
[49:21] um let's just play he is here
[49:24] [Music]
[49:26] as Christians sometimes we we get tired
[49:29] of asking
[49:31] we get tired of praying for the same
[49:34] things over and over and over again
[49:38] and
[49:41] we get warned in the battle and the
[49:44] struggles of life and just exhausted
[49:48] [Music]
[49:51] there's a there's a fountain for that
[49:55] they that weighed upon the Lord they'll
[49:57] renew their strength they'll Mount up
[49:59] with wings as Eagles maybe we've come to
[50:02] the point where we're
[50:05] bored complacent we like to say
[50:07] complacent but it's actually bored
[50:10] we're bored with our walk and our
[50:12] relationship with Christ and we don't
[50:14] want to admit that
[50:16] we don't want to admit that
[50:18] but we can we can talk to God about that
[50:22] he understands he understands
[50:26] he remembers that we're just Dust We
[50:34] 1954 Divine Healing I can imagine being
[50:37] an old man coming down whenever my

[50:50] lot of tracks through the Briar patches

[51:00] Seas let's have the rough way too I must
[51:04] fight if I must Reign I must get some of
