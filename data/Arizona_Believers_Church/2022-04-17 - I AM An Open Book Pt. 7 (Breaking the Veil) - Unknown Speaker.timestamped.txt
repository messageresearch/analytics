[0:00] if you'd like to look at matthew chapter
[0:02] 27 again i want to look at verse 50 and
[0:05] this is going to help me get started
[0:07] and i really appreciate your attention
[0:09] today there is a lot that's in my heart
[0:12] to deliver i think at the end and at the
[0:14] end of it all it's very simple but we
[0:16] might be picking up a lot of different
[0:17] pieces to put it together into a puzzle
[0:20] that i think is going to have really
[0:22] great clarity and uh
[0:24] strength for you so in matthew chapter
[0:26] 27 verse 50
[0:28] uh it says and i want to read this and
[0:30] then come back to it but i wanted to
[0:32] take it to verse 54 with you says jesus
[0:35] when he had cried again with a loud
[0:36] voice
[0:37] and yielded up the ghost and behold the
[0:39] veil the temple was rent and twain
[0:42] from the top to the bottom and the earth
[0:44] did quake and the rocks rent
[0:47] and the graves were open and many of the
[0:48] saints which slept arose and came out of
[0:51] the graves after his resurrection and
[0:53] went to the holy city and appeared unto
[0:54] many
[0:55] now when the centurion and they that
[0:57] were with him watching jesus saw the
[0:59] earthquake and those things that were
[1:01] done they feared greatly saying truly
[1:04] this was the son of god and in other
[1:06] writings it's very clear that it's the
[1:08] centurion that's remarking this in the
[1:10] other gospels it said this meant truly
[1:12] this man
[1:13] was the son of god this is a a
[1:16] remarkable narration of events just in
[1:18] these these few verses that we're
[1:19] looking at right here
[1:21] and what matthew does when he
[1:24] in these verses this is what really i
[1:25] wanted to start here because when i was
[1:27] just looking at um
[1:29] the breadth of the subject matter that i
[1:31] wanted to share today i had i found that
[1:34] i had to find a starting place to begin
[1:36] to build and i kept coming back to
[1:38] and my subject was on the uh on the veil
[1:40] being torn
[1:42] and some of the symmetry with the open
[1:44] of the seals and i'd been looking at
[1:45] that and i kept coming back to this
[1:48] passage here
[1:49] and notice just what an incredible
[1:51] journey that matthew takes us on as we
[1:53] begin to read this is in verse 50 we
[1:56] hear jesus cries with a loud voice as
[1:58] soon as he cries again with this loud
[2:00] voice and that's going to have
[2:01] significance as we'll come back to
[2:04] and yields up the ghost john and matthew
[2:06] begins to write and behold the veil of
[2:08] the temple so in verse 51
[2:10] we go from christ on the cross and we
[2:13] enter into jerusalem
[2:15] and we go we go into the temple and
[2:18] inside the temple he describes and we
[2:20] were able to see by his narration that
[2:22] the veil is torn in two
[2:24] and then he goes from the temple and
[2:27] watching this veil be torn in verse 52
[2:30] he actually jumps forward in time
[2:33] and the events that he describes and he
[2:34] jumps forward to the resurrection
[2:35] morning
[2:37] at the time when the graves are opened
[2:39] and the saints are rising because it
[2:40] says after his resurrection
[2:43] and and you'll find that this is many
[2:45] just concur with this and brother
[2:46] branham oriented us to the resurrection
[2:49] morning when this event would have
[2:50] happened and so you see these sleeping
[2:53] saints rise up and this is in verse 52
[2:56] but then our we kind of follow them into
[2:58] the holy city so our view shifts back to
[3:00] jerusalem as the bible says the old
[3:02] testament saints appear unto many
[3:05] and then in verse 54 we come right back
[3:07] to the crucifixion day
[3:09] so notice what we've just done jesus
[3:11] cries with a loud voice and then he
[3:13] brings us into the temple and we see the
[3:14] veil rent in two and then once that
[3:17] happens he fast forwards to a
[3:19] resurrection and i hope you kind of
[3:20] realize how these things are now there's
[3:22] a reason why matthew writes it this way
[3:24] he fast forwards a couple days later to
[3:26] a resurrection
[3:27] and then he comes back to the cross at
[3:29] the time where christ has cried out and
[3:32] those that stood near hear him and the
[3:34] centurion declares
[3:36] uh that
[3:37] this truly this is the son of god
[3:40] so matthew jumps from the cross to the
[3:42] temple
[3:43] on friday
[3:45] over into sunday
[3:46] then comes back to friday at calvary
[3:49] and so there's uh there's this moving
[3:51] around because jesus will look at later
[3:53] he's not in jerusalem he's just outside
[3:55] the city as it were when he's when he's
[3:57] crucified so he goes from calvary into
[3:59] jerusalem into the temple then it goes
[4:02] forward to sunday wherever wherever that
[4:04] view would be bringing in the view of
[4:05] the old testament states raising
[4:07] together and then when you hear the uh
[4:10] when you know the people that brother
[4:11] brown says were there then you know
[4:13] there was this place where they the
[4:15] forefathers were buried so it's almost
[4:16] as if our view goes over there and then
[4:18] they appear in dominion jerusalem and
[4:20] there's this moving around and all these
[4:22] things are connected together so if i
[4:24] don't come to a resurrection scripture
[4:26] this morning where we talk about the
[4:28] grave being empty what we're talking
[4:30] about we're going to be focusing in
[4:31] verse 51 because my easter message is
[4:33] the breaking of the veil
[4:36] and as soon as that veil is broken
[4:37] there's a resurrection
[4:40] as soon as it's broken matthew says and
[4:42] the graves were opened and many bodies
[4:44] of the saints which slept the rose and
[4:45] came out of the grace after his
[4:47] resurrection and went into the holy city
[4:49] and appeared to me so this the breaking
[4:50] of the veil is what we want to focus on
[4:52] because this is a significant happening
[4:54] that we want to see
[4:56] and i and i say i say we want to see we
[4:59] just want to fellowship on so i believe
[5:00] that you understand these things and
[5:02] they're very precious to you but i want
[5:03] to look at this br the breaking of the
[5:05] veil is a type of what transpires in
[5:07] revelations chapter 5
[5:09] in the open of the book and the
[5:10] revealing of the i am which you are a
[5:12] part of
[5:14] and so in matthew chapter 27 verse 50 it
[5:16] says and jesus had cried when jesus had
[5:18] cried again with a loud voice he yielded
[5:21] up the ghost
[5:23] and there's two other notable instances
[5:25] where christ cries with the loud voice
[5:29] and we even in what we just read he
[5:31] cried with a loud voice my god my god
[5:33] why hast thou forsaken me but i want to
[5:35] look at these two other notable
[5:37] instances where christ
[5:39] is crying with the loud voice and you'll
[5:41] find that they're they match
[5:43] they're matching what transpires here in
[5:44] matthew 27. in john chapter 11 verses 43
[5:48] and 44 it's the resurrection of lazarus
[5:50] there's so many types we could dig into
[5:52] there in john chapter 11 a lot of things
[5:53] that we could mine out and enjoy but it
[5:56] says and when he had thus had spoken
[5:58] he cried with a loud voice lazarus come
[6:01] forth and so he's it's not a general cry
[6:04] it's a very specific direct cry uh had
[6:06] he just generally called to those that
[6:08] were sleeping uh and under that promise
[6:11] and and under those sacrifices looking
[6:13] to come then what happened in matthew
[6:14] chapter 27 would have happened at that
[6:16] very moment because he had that voice of
[6:18] the resurrection with them and he said
[6:20] lazarus come forth and he that was dead
[6:24] came forth bound hand and foot with
[6:25] grave clothes and his face was bound
[6:27] about with the napkin
[6:28] jesus saith unto them loose him and let
[6:30] him go
[6:31] what is it that we read in john chapter
[6:33] 11 the voice of the resurrection
[6:35] waking sleeping lazarus so this is even
[6:38] lazarus is a type of the old testament
[6:40] or the the saints that sleep the
[6:42] new testament saints he's a
[6:44] representation of those that sleep that
[6:46] are going to be resurrected and this is
[6:48] the voice of the resurrection he cries
[6:50] with a loud voice lazarus come forth we
[6:53] know this is the same voice in first
[6:54] thessalonians chapter 4 verses 15 and
[6:57] 16. for this we say unto you by the word
[6:59] of the lord that we which are alive and
[7:01] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[7:03] not prevent or hinder
[7:05] uh them which are asleep for the lord
[7:08] himself shall descend from heaven this
[7:10] is christ himself the lord himself shall
[7:13] descend from heaven with a shout
[7:16] with the voice of the archangel and with
[7:18] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[7:20] shall rise first christ himself does all
[7:23] three as he's descending the shout it's
[7:25] the message it's the living bread of
[7:27] life it's christ that final attraction
[7:29] that final pull gathering together for
[7:31] the bride and then the next is the voice
[7:33] of the archangel and very clear what the
[7:35] teaching is on this it's the voice of
[7:37] the resurrection it's the same voice in
[7:39] john chapter 11 brother branham said so
[7:41] in matthew 27 he's crying with a loud
[7:44] voice and it says and when he cried with
[7:46] the loud voice he gave up the ghost he
[7:48] yielded up the ghost so when he cries
[7:51] with a loud voice in matthew
[7:53] he he gives up life
[7:55] to give up the ghost it means to expire
[7:57] to breathe out to breathe out one's life
[7:59] to it's to breathe your last breath
[8:01] and there's some that describe when
[8:03] they're near one when they're dying
[8:04] there's this breathing that takes place
[8:06] and there's this expiration of breath it
[8:09] even means when he gave up the gave it
[8:10] the ghost means to expire so notice he
[8:12] cries with a loud voice and his life
[8:15] leaves him and he dies but in john
[8:17] chapter 11 the same one who cried the
[8:19] voice of christ gives life to the one
[8:21] that was dead
[8:22] he cries with a loud voice and like life
[8:24] is it expires from him but the same one
[8:27] in john 11 when he cried it brought life
[8:29] to one that was sleeping
[8:31] now another notable instance where the
[8:32] same one christ cries with a loud voice
[8:36] is in revelations chapter 10. we'll read
[8:38] the verse three these things are
[8:39] extremely familiar to us it says and i
[8:41] saw another mighty angel come down from
[8:44] heaven the very word used there is
[8:45] descend from heaven
[8:47] i saw another mighty angel come down
[8:50] from heaven it's very notable to
[8:51] remember this
[8:52] coming from heaven
[8:54] and there's some there's some uh
[8:57] movement there's something that's
[8:58] crossed over in this
[9:00] and this mighty angel we know is christ
[9:02] that's who this mighty angel is i'm glad
[9:04] at least one person knows this
[9:05] if anybody else agrees with him as we go
[9:07] forward you can amen him
[9:09] he says and i saw another mighty angel
[9:11] which is christ come down from heaven
[9:12] clothed with the cloud
[9:14] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[9:16] face was as it were the sun and his feet
[9:18] as pillars of fire this description is
[9:20] very uh will be even stand out to you
[9:23] even more when you begin to associate
[9:26] christ being a high priest in the holy
[9:29] of holies uh him even being a type of
[9:31] the mercy seat and all the all the
[9:33] elements that would have existed in the
[9:34] sacrifices and in the temple and the
[9:36] tabernacle and this description of
[9:39] christ here it would be so profound
[9:41] to a rabbi or to a jew so he descends
[9:43] from heaven he's clothed with the cloud
[9:45] a rainbow upon his head his face as it
[9:47] was the sun and his feet as pillars of
[9:49] fire and he had his hand a little book
[9:51] open
[9:52] it's that book of redemption the sealed
[9:53] book in revelations chapter 5 he has a
[9:55] little book open and he set his right
[9:57] foot upon the sea in his left foot on
[9:59] the earth so his foot is uh he has one
[10:03] foot on earth one foot on sea his head
[10:04] is in heaven as it were but he's
[10:06] descending down from heaven and cried
[10:09] with a loud voice
[10:10] once again it's the same uh same
[10:13] verbiage actually when you read it
[10:15] um
[10:16] it reads in the greek it would look like
[10:17] it says uh a megaphone
[10:20] because it's it's crying it's the very
[10:21] word phone and megas it's a it's he's
[10:24] crying he cries with a loud voice as
[10:26] when a lion roareth and when he cried
[10:28] the seven thunders uttered their voices
[10:31] this is the same one in matthew 27 that
[10:33] cried with a loud voice at his
[10:34] crucifixion it's the same one at the
[10:36] grave of lazarus when he said lazarus
[10:38] come forth
[10:39] but in matthew 27 it says when he cried
[10:42] again with a loud voice this is a lamb
[10:45] that is uh
[10:48] crying out in anguish and pain
[10:50] he's suffering and and he cries out he's
[10:52] a bloodied sacrifice he's
[10:54] life is leaving him and he's beaten
[10:57] beyond recognition and he's crying out
[10:59] in pain and the anguish of even the
[11:02] being rejected by his father and the
[11:03] father turned his back to him and he's
[11:06] left completely alone and in his pain
[11:08] and his agony he cries with the loud
[11:10] voice
[11:13] that is to say my god my god why hast
[11:16] thou forsaken me
[11:17] what an anguish what a crime and this is
[11:20] one of as a lamb who's bloodied who's
[11:22] slain but in revelations chapter 10 he
[11:25] cried and as when a lion roars and he's
[11:28] described as a mighty angel here's the
[11:30] mighty angel here's the one who is
[11:32] conquered you have the the lamb his
[11:34] breath is expired and he cries with the
[11:36] loud voice and life leaves him but now
[11:38] you have one who cries the same one
[11:41] cries and it's not a forsaken son on the
[11:43] cross it's as a lion roaring
[11:47] which brings us to revelations chapter 5
[11:49] verses 5 and 6.
[11:52] one of the elders john is weeping
[11:53] because the book is closed and no one is
[11:55] worthy brother brandon even says in one
[11:57] place worthy to interpret it
[11:59] that makes it puts in a different light
[12:01] even in revelations chapter 5 verses 5
[12:03] and 6 and one of the elders saith unto
[12:05] me weep not
[12:06] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[12:09] the root of david hath prevailed to open
[12:12] the book and to loose the seven seals
[12:15] thereof no one is worthy in the earth
[12:17] anywhere nowhere no one's worthy to take
[12:19] the book even to look on the book but
[12:20] there was one who was worthy and he's
[12:23] described as the lion of the tribe of
[12:25] judah
[12:26] he's the one who is worthy to take the
[12:28] book and it says he prevailed he
[12:30] conquered he overcame to take the book
[12:32] and to loose and to open up that book
[12:35] and to loose the seals of it and he's
[12:37] the lion of the tribe of judah and
[12:39] that's why when he descends in
[12:40] revelations chapter 10 and he cries with
[12:43] a loud voice it's as a lion that is
[12:45] roaring because he's the mighty
[12:46] conqueror
[12:48] if you even think about the picture that
[12:49] was taken in the cloud we look at it as
[12:51] a wig but it looks like a lion's mane
[12:53] too
[12:54] because this is what's being expressed
[12:56] this kingship this deity this lion this
[12:59] of the tribe of judah
[13:01] and then john knows it's the line of the
[13:04] tribe of judah and he would he would
[13:05] know very well with the line of tribe of
[13:07] judah the root of david would refer to
[13:09] the messiah
[13:10] and be i beheld and lo in the midst of
[13:13] the throne
[13:15] and of the four beasts and we know these
[13:17] four beasts the four gospels represented
[13:19] the four gospels uh that are the
[13:21] protectors of the mercy seat in the
[13:23] midst of the throne or something very
[13:25] focal uh specific that's being looked at
[13:28] here and in the midst of the elders
[13:29] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[13:32] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[13:33] are the seven spirits that god sent
[13:35] forth and all the earth
[13:36] now
[13:37] he's not looking at something else he's
[13:38] looking at the line of the tribe of
[13:40] judah
[13:41] it's the lion of the tribe of judas that
[13:43] office it's that
[13:45] in the taking of the book he's the lion
[13:46] who that hath prevailed and then he
[13:48] looks and the lion is the lamb
[13:51] it's the same one who was slain he looks
[13:54] and sees the lamb as it had been slain
[13:55] so it wants to give you this image and
[13:57] we know this is symbolism
[13:58] and its revelation is the book of
[14:00] symbols
[14:01] and i can still remember the first time
[14:03] uh that i ever heard brother lonnie
[14:05] jenkins preach it was on tape
[14:07] and uh and so he's the teacher right and
[14:10] so he says and i want to read over here
[14:12] in revelation book of symbols i was like
[14:14] does he gotta call it the book of
[14:15] symbols i mean and he was just reading
[14:17] from the sermon revelation uh book of
[14:20] symbols and it was when i learned that i
[14:21] was being a little snarky i was like wow
[14:23] that's how teachers like they they just
[14:25] it's just the way he said it it seemed
[14:26] very kind of you know book of symbols i
[14:28] was like i got a revelation yes it's the
[14:30] book of symbols and it's actually a
[14:32] sermon called revelation book of symbols
[14:34] so we know this is and he was quoting
[14:35] brother branham so
[14:38] sorry brother lonnie
[14:41] he got me back
[14:43] later on
[14:45] uh
[14:46] the uh where am i here
[14:49] so it's we know this is a symbolic
[14:51] representation there's something that's
[14:52] being expressed here that we see in
[14:54] symbolism and so it's the line of the
[14:56] tribe of judah that takes the book and
[14:58] opens the book but john wants us to see
[15:00] a bloody lamb in the midst of the throne
[15:03] in the presence of these four beasts in
[15:05] the midst of the elders there's a lamb
[15:06] as it had been slain it's bloody
[15:09] it's wounded it's the one that paid the
[15:11] price of redemption and so when we go
[15:13] back to matthew chapter 27 when the lamb
[15:16] which was on the cross cried again with
[15:18] a loud voice and life leaves him
[15:20] immediately says and behold look at
[15:22] verse 51 and behold the veil of the
[15:25] temple was rent and twain torn in two
[15:28] from the top to the bottom
[15:30] so it's from the top to the bottom and
[15:32] this they say that um
[15:35] studying the bible doesn't say exactly
[15:37] how thick it was but they say that it
[15:38] was four inches thick
[15:41] and that it was it was so heavy uh
[15:43] and all the different elements of it to
[15:44] be carried that it was impossible for
[15:46] man to rip it
[15:47] and so just to be very clear that it
[15:50] wasn't man that did it it tore from the
[15:52] top to the bottom
[15:54] and at the same time it says the earth
[15:56] did quake and the rocks rent we know
[15:58] that there's a earthquake signifying
[16:00] judgment
[16:01] and so he cries with a loud voice and as
[16:03] soon as he cries with a loud voice the
[16:05] earth is quaking and rocks are breaking
[16:07] open open there's there's a shearing
[16:09] there's an opening up of these rocks
[16:11] and this is in the shaking
[16:13] this is very important to recognize
[16:15] because it's that
[16:17] we cries with a loud voice and the earth
[16:19] is shaking and rocks are being broke
[16:21] open but he wants us to look inside the
[16:23] temple and see that the veil is being
[16:25] torn into
[16:26] and in hebrews chapter 12 verses 26 to
[16:29] 27
[16:31] it says whose voice then shook the earth
[16:33] and we know that the voice shook there
[16:34] on the mountain but now he hath promised
[16:36] saying yet once more i shake not the
[16:38] earth only but also the heavens so see
[16:40] these two things coming together again
[16:43] and this language is i'm going to shake
[16:45] not just the earth but the heaven
[16:47] and yet this word
[16:49] and this word yet once more signifieth
[16:52] the removing of those things that are
[16:53] shaken as of things that are made that
[16:56] those things which cannot be shaken may
[16:58] remain
[16:59] remember that the tabernacle the temple
[17:01] was made with hands it was made by men
[17:03] and so in when the
[17:06] when the ground the earth is shaking and
[17:07] the rocks are breaking and the veil of
[17:09] the temple is torn this is a removing of
[17:12] those things that are shaken
[17:15] it's a fulfillment there's a fulfillment
[17:17] to israel that paul was talking about
[17:18] that there has been a fulfillment of
[17:20] this judgment of the shaking and this
[17:21] tearing down of things that were made a
[17:23] removing of the sacrifices the removing
[17:26] of the priestly order and this is a this
[17:28] is fulfilled to israel but he says yet
[17:30] once more is signified it's going to
[17:33] happen again so there's a fulfillment to
[17:34] the bride
[17:36] there's a fulfillment to zion
[17:38] and so this was judgment i i'm i'm deep
[17:41] into my subject already so
[17:44] if you're kind of waiting
[17:45] if i've established some kind of
[17:47] pavlov's dog thing with you guys let's
[17:49] just not do it i'm deep into what i'm
[17:51] preaching i'm going i love it i i i'm
[17:54] i'm inspired i don't don't know that i
[17:56] have a lot of fluff
[17:58] brother andrew's dad told me one time he
[18:00] wanted me to do a devotion at a men's
[18:02] meeting and he said take a sermon remove
[18:04] all the fluff and told me a little bit
[18:06] about how he prepares his sermons uh but
[18:08] i thought i don't have any fluff so i'll
[18:10] just try to find a short sermon
[18:12] but um and so i'm i'm in it this is not
[18:15] foundation stuff and this is just not me
[18:17] warming up if you need me to sweat i'll
[18:19] try to sweat
[18:21] turn off the air so i can people think
[18:22] i'm anointed
[18:25] so this was at this very moment this was
[18:28] judgment to the jewish church
[18:30] jesus here's the lamb on the cross he's
[18:33] dying he's bleeding out he dies
[18:35] and and the loud voice and the shaking
[18:37] of the earth and then the renting of the
[18:39] veil it's judgment to the jewish church
[18:41] when at the end of their jewish ages
[18:44] at their very climax it's the ending of
[18:46] the ordinances it's the ending of the
[18:47] government as we went through this in a
[18:49] couple services there's this signified
[18:51] the end of the jewish church state the
[18:53] end of the priesthood all these
[18:55] different things i say end you see the
[18:57] fulfillment of everything it pointed to
[19:00] so it says the veil of the temple was
[19:02] rent and twain from top to bottom
[19:04] i think about the very moment that this
[19:06] is happening if you could if we could
[19:07] just have matthew
[19:09] lead us into the temple at this very
[19:10] moment i wish he could have maybe
[19:12] described it in more detail but he makes
[19:14] sure that we know it's between the sixth
[19:15] and the ninth hour he's wanting us to
[19:17] kind of think about the very things that
[19:19] are happening because we call it easter
[19:20] what are the jews calling it the feast
[19:22] of the passover
[19:23] and the feast of unleavened bread
[19:24] they're keeping these feasts and so they
[19:26] have they are coming to jerusalem to
[19:29] celebrate this feast there's people
[19:30] bringing in their sacrifices they're
[19:33] using their temple to celebrate the
[19:35] feast of passover just like we're using
[19:37] our church they're using their
[19:38] synagogues and there's all these events
[19:41] are transpiring in this at this very
[19:43] time and so at the time of the passover
[19:45] sacrifice
[19:46] this very time that christ is being
[19:48] sacrificed the priest would have been
[19:51] in the holy place at the altar of
[19:52] incense
[19:53] at the golden altar
[19:55] it says in exodus chapter 30 verse 6 and
[19:57] thou shalt put it before the veil
[19:59] this altar where where the feast of
[20:02] passover the blood of all the lambs that
[20:04] would be brought would be poured out
[20:06] upon this altar he says it put it before
[20:09] the veil that is by the ark of the
[20:11] testimony so
[20:12] in order to not
[20:14] show off my artistic skills
[20:16] artistic skills
[20:18] i didn't do any kind of diagrams or
[20:20] anything like that but you just have the
[20:22] the ho the holiest the holy of holies
[20:24] the most holy place where the ark of the
[20:26] covenant was and is there's a veil and
[20:29] it says that this altar is by before
[20:31] that veil and the veil is by the ark of
[20:33] the testament before the mercy seat that
[20:36] is over the testament which is the law
[20:37] all those tablets where i will meet thee
[20:40] so this is this kind of gives us why
[20:42] don't you start thinking about this
[20:43] picture of the tabernacle and the temple
[20:46] that you would have the place where god
[20:48] meets the high priest it was between the
[20:50] cherubim
[20:52] over the mercy seat which was that gold
[20:54] piece and underneath that was the law
[20:56] was the tablet which it says the
[20:58] testimony so it's the ark of testimony
[21:00] and remember that law was a witness
[21:02] against israel and then how paul turns
[21:04] it right around and now he says the
[21:06] blood is sprinkled upon our hearts and
[21:09] the law is written in our hearts and we
[21:10] have a mediator of that of that offering
[21:13] and we realize oh my now i'm in the very
[21:15] image of what god was drawing out in
[21:18] that holy place the most holy place
[21:20] so there is the
[21:22] holy of holies the ark of the covenant
[21:25] inside is the testimony overlaid with
[21:27] the a lid was made of solid gold with
[21:30] the cherubim attached to it and then
[21:32] there's a veil that separates the most
[21:35] holy place from the holy place the holy
[21:36] of holies from this sanctuary where the
[21:39] uh the altar of incense or the golden
[21:42] altar would have been where this priest
[21:45] would have been pouring blood out upon
[21:46] it
[21:47] so here at the feast of the passover
[21:49] this very time we have our christian
[21:52] resurrection the crucifixion of the lamb
[21:54] but to israel the priest would be
[21:55] applying the blood of lambs to the altar
[21:59] and they're saying this is just going by
[22:00] tradition and and the the scholars and
[22:03] the ones that have poured into this and
[22:04] lined these things up they'd say about
[22:06] the ninth hour the passover lambs are
[22:08] being slain in the temple
[22:10] and we read in our bible is from the
[22:12] sixth hour to the ninth hour and about
[22:13] the ninth hour jesus is crying with the
[22:15] loud voice
[22:17] and so at the very moment that god tore
[22:19] the veil
[22:21] there at the same at that very moment
[22:23] there's all these people whether you
[22:24] want to look at it over those many days
[22:26] of this these feasts
[22:28] walking in these ordinances walking in
[22:29] the sacrifices but at that very moment
[22:31] that a priest could have been there
[22:33] before the altar of incense god tore the
[22:35] veil
[22:36] that separated the golden altar from the
[22:38] ark of the covenant that tore down that
[22:41] partition that a high priest could only
[22:43] enter in behind once a year on the day
[22:45] of atonement but here they're making
[22:47] this sin offering upon the golden altar
[22:50] and it's at that moment that god takes
[22:52] that veil and rips it apart
[22:54] and so the breaking of the veil the
[22:56] opening it's called the curtain of
[22:58] testimony in some places the breaking of
[23:00] that veil or the opening of that curtain
[23:02] signaled a great revelation
[23:04] and it signified a tremendous event so i
[23:07] want you maybe look at this event and a
[23:08] revelation and maybe we'll try to use
[23:10] those two different distinctions to
[23:11] bring something out
[23:13] there was uh very significant historical
[23:16] things unfolding very literal things so
[23:18] as we read matthew describe it this is
[23:20] literally happening but there's a they
[23:23] have great spiritual uh representations
[23:26] so there's a literal tearing or dividing
[23:29] of the veil and in that ripping of the
[23:31] veil it represented the ending of the
[23:34] jewish ages an ending of their systems
[23:38] now
[23:39] that maybe this is just a more
[23:41] historical context
[23:42] when the veil was torn so let's just
[23:44] dramatize it and i don't think you have
[23:46] to get picky on whether or not there was
[23:48] actually a priest in there and whether
[23:49] they would have been there on that day
[23:51] because it's wonderful to see people
[23:52] debate the days and the times and the
[23:54] months but we're just looking at the
[23:55] truth of it all right but it's if we
[23:58] could just imagine that maybe there was
[24:00] a priest in there with a
[24:02] lamb's blood pointed out upon the altar
[24:05] and at the very moment this veil
[24:08] is torn
[24:09] from top to bottom
[24:11] and when it happens it would have
[24:12] exposed the view to
[24:16] the holy of holies
[24:18] and as he looked do you know what would
[24:20] have been the most pronounced thing at
[24:22] that very moment
[24:24] there's no mercy
[24:27] there's there's no mercy seat there as a
[24:29] matter of fact the history is and now
[24:30] i'm forgetting the the name of the stone
[24:32] that they would apply the blood to there
[24:34] is no mercy it had been taken
[24:37] and with no mercy seat there was no
[24:39] blood upon that mercy seat there was no
[24:42] place where he would meet them between
[24:44] the cherubim therefore there was no
[24:45] shekinah glory as a matter of fact if
[24:47] you were a jew and you believed that
[24:49] once a year the high priest went in
[24:51] behind that veil and applied blood the
[24:54] of the atone toning sacrifice upon the
[24:57] lid of the ark of the testimony between
[24:59] the cherubim and there would be a cloud
[25:01] even upon that lid and the presence of
[25:03] god would come in there and you thought
[25:05] that was atoning once a year for the
[25:07] sins of the people and all of a sudden
[25:09] you got to peak behind the curtain and
[25:10] saw there was no ark of the testament
[25:12] these guys are a bunch of phonies
[25:15] this is fake this is fraudulent this is
[25:18] bloodless worship there's no blood here
[25:20] there's no atonement here they're not
[25:22] even doing what they were told to do
[25:25] and that's what's represented when this
[25:27] veil is taken away you look into the
[25:29] holy place and nothing there that god
[25:31] said should be there is there anymore
[25:35] and now watch how what this represents
[25:37] and the indictment brother bram says
[25:38] christ is god's provided limb
[25:41] now notice how appropriate it was
[25:43] showing that that jerusalem was ceasing
[25:46] that language is uh very i think we a
[25:48] lot of us probably recognize that
[25:49] language that jerusalem is ceasing that
[25:52] order those church ages that
[25:54] dispensation uh the law is ceasing the
[25:57] law has been fulfilled why because
[25:58] christ is the end of the law he is the
[26:01] fulfillment of the law so it's showing
[26:02] that that jerusalem is ceasing ending
[26:05] terminating expiring
[26:07] so when the very breath of the lamb
[26:10] and the breath comes out
[26:12] and that in the life of the lamb is
[26:13] expired at that very moment everything
[26:16] that every sacrifice always pointed to
[26:18] ends itself
[26:20] why because the bleeding lamb that was
[26:22] sacrificed pointed to that one the
[26:24] bullocks and the doves and the blood and
[26:26] everything that transpired through all
[26:28] those ordinances and all those offerings
[26:30] was pointing to the perfect one that
[26:32] would come so it's only appropriate that
[26:34] when that lamb died the rest of the
[26:36] system ceased to exist
[26:40] and he says when he says it was in
[26:42] effect until that hour
[26:45] the blood of the lamb was all right
[26:47] until that day the paschal lambs all the
[26:49] lambs that were being bought all the
[26:50] lambs that were being brought a lamb to
[26:52] a house he says but at that crucifixion
[26:55] but now at the crucifixion it changes
[26:59] the old system is done
[27:02] there was a new one and the lamb was at
[27:04] the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial
[27:06] lamb was on the grounds
[27:09] i was pouring through the psalms and and
[27:11] looking at the different images that we
[27:13] could bring up before you in the
[27:14] scripture of the very things that they
[27:16] were singing
[27:18] and the psalms that they were crying out
[27:20] at the very moment the christ the true
[27:22] paschal lamb
[27:23] was there on the grounds being crucified
[27:27] and as he hung there
[27:31] he is not in the temple
[27:33] his blood is not being applied to
[27:36] the altar of incense or the golden altar
[27:38] it's not going beyond that veil and his
[27:40] blood being sprinkled upon the mercy
[27:42] seat but he's outside the camp
[27:45] he's outside the city
[27:47] and why because it was written in the
[27:49] law in the ordinances that there were
[27:50] certain things that took place and
[27:52] things were dealt with outside the camp
[27:55] what was it showing that god was
[27:57] foreshadowing by prophecy that you're
[27:59] going to reject the sacrifice he had
[28:02] them acted out every time they did it
[28:04] the sacrifice was brought outside of the
[28:06] city to be burned there was even a
[28:08] sacrifice that was let go outside the
[28:10] camp signifying that you're not going to
[28:12] receive the sacrifice you're not going
[28:13] to receive christ so there hung jesus
[28:16] christ outside the gate beyond the camp
[28:19] and what was it it was the mercy seat
[28:24] i know sometimes people struggle with
[28:26] the concept of a mercy seat
[28:28] they have it in their minds maybe it's a
[28:30] literal chair that says mercy on it or
[28:33] it's a cushion and it's bolted to the
[28:35] ground but really in the bible the mercy
[28:37] seat was always in motion
[28:39] even in the tabernacle in the days of
[28:41] the tabernacle witnessed in the
[28:42] wilderness that the staves and the poles
[28:44] and everything i put it on a cart they
[28:46] had to move it
[28:48] and so this is an event that matthew
[28:50] takes us from he cries with a loud voice
[28:52] we're watching the lamb which was deity
[28:56] bloodied and it's the mercy seat
[29:00] hanging there on the cross every element
[29:01] you need for the mercy seat is there in
[29:03] christ as it hangs across upon the cross
[29:05] so matthew says come real quick and look
[29:07] there there's no mercy seat there
[29:09] there's no ark of the covenant there's
[29:11] no there's no golden lid there's no
[29:13] cherubim there's no shekinah glory there
[29:15] christ was hanging and we would say in
[29:17] plain view
[29:20] and in hebrews chapter 13 verses 11 and
[29:22] 12 it says for the bodies of those
[29:24] beasts it's referring to the ones that
[29:25] were sacrificed
[29:26] whose blood is
[29:27] brought into the sanctum the sanctuary
[29:30] is the holy place not the holy of holies
[29:32] so it's referring to these different
[29:33] offerings where the blood would be
[29:34] brought into the sanctuary where the the
[29:36] table of show bread was the golden altar
[29:39] and the candlesticks for those bodies of
[29:41] those beasts whose blood is brought into
[29:42] the sanctuary by the high priest for sin
[29:45] are burned without the camp so they're
[29:47] brought in and their blood is poured out
[29:49] but then they're taken out of the temple
[29:50] out of the uh of the tabernacle and
[29:52] they're burned outside the gate without
[29:54] the camp it says wherefore therefore and
[29:57] that this is why jesus also that he
[30:00] might sanctify the people with his own
[30:02] blood suffered without the gate
[30:05] you can read it leviticus 4 21 where the
[30:08] sin offerings were brought outside of
[30:10] the gate and burned
[30:11] there's other instances in numbers and
[30:13] different place where they bring some of
[30:14] these images out but christ now is the
[30:17] fulfillment of this act of taking the
[30:19] beasts that were sacrificed and their
[30:21] bodies in bringing them outside the gate
[30:24] and disposing of them and burning them
[30:25] it says paul now catches this revelation
[30:28] and says that christ suffered beyond or
[30:31] outside the camp or beyond the gate or
[30:33] without the gate
[30:35] this is what christ did
[30:38] now
[30:39] that what took place
[30:41] in the old testament was pointing to the
[30:43] lamb that would be rejected
[30:46] and crucified
[30:47] without the camp
[30:50] without the gate
[30:52] but now there's still a representation
[30:54] in it brother batman going beyond the
[30:56] camp
[30:57] he says he rebuked them and they put him
[30:59] out of their camp
[31:00] what happened the days of his first
[31:01] coming jesus suffered without the camp
[31:03] so he brings in hebrews 13. they put him
[31:06] out of the camp outside way beyond their
[31:09] camp
[31:10] we find out that the bible said in this
[31:12] last day under this laodicean age they
[31:15] would do the same thing they would be
[31:17] put out of the camp
[31:20] now he's saying that there's a not
[31:22] there's not just an image that
[31:23] foreshadowed in the old testament of his
[31:25] first coming but now in the end of the
[31:26] cr the gentile church ages it would
[31:29] happen again
[31:32] now this is
[31:34] um this is to me is very striking i hope
[31:36] you can just see these pieces uh coming
[31:38] together i think it's going to be up to
[31:40] you maybe to put the puzzle together
[31:41] with the holy spirit's help but i feel
[31:43] that i'm giving you a lot of material to
[31:44] work with
[31:47] so now he says it happens again the same
[31:49] thing he's going to be put out of the
[31:51] camp in the last days in laodicean age
[31:54] where is that going to be revelations 3
[31:56] 20.
[31:57] behold i stand at the door and knock
[32:00] if any man hear my voice and open the
[32:03] door i will come into him and will sup
[32:06] with him and he with me this is
[32:08] definitely descriptive symbolic language
[32:11] but a door is an entrance it's a way or
[32:12] a passage
[32:14] and the door is what's keeping the
[32:17] separating the fellowship
[32:20] because that's what he brings up that if
[32:21] this door can open then we can
[32:23] fellowship so the open of the door is
[32:24] the removal of a barrier
[32:27] that's keeping christ from having
[32:28] fellowship with somebody
[32:31] and so there's a separation what we
[32:33] could take from this there's a
[32:34] separation from the presence of christ
[32:37] we know all the things that brother
[32:38] graham said because he deals with the
[32:39] scripture quite a bit the word has been
[32:41] pushed out
[32:43] and so when
[32:44] it's described this way behold i stand
[32:46] at the door and knock
[32:48] if any man will hear my voice and open
[32:50] the door
[32:51] there is a symbolic representation of
[32:54] christ haven't been removed or put
[32:56] outside the camp
[32:58] and when christ is pushed out then there
[33:01] is a ch we could say a change of
[33:03] dispensation or even a change of
[33:05] administration because something has
[33:06] changed something has changed from how
[33:09] it had been
[33:11] think of it this way in revelations
[33:12] chapter 1 verses 12 to 15. okay before
[33:15] we start reading this can we if you're
[33:17] looking at revelations 3 20 ponder this
[33:19] again we know and we're taught very
[33:21] clearly very plainly that christ is no
[33:24] longer in the church
[33:26] he's pushed out he's made a refugee he's
[33:29] kicked out he's rejected he's no longer
[33:32] in the church this signifies a change or
[33:35] transition
[33:36] because now he has to deal with the
[33:38] people at this moment he's having to say
[33:40] listen i'm knocking on the door you have
[33:42] to hear my voice and has to be removing
[33:44] of what separates for us to come back
[33:46] into fellowship again
[33:48] and the first age they had left their
[33:49] first love and it culminates where
[33:51] eventually finally they get so lukewarm
[33:54] they pushed christ out
[33:57] it took a long time but it finally
[33:59] happened
[34:00] now to understand this image
[34:02] how
[34:03] striking it is to read that christ is no
[34:05] longer in the church
[34:07] in revelations chapter 1 verses 12 to 15
[34:10] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[34:12] with me
[34:14] and being turned i saw seven golden
[34:16] candle sticks
[34:17] and in the midst of the seven
[34:19] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[34:21] man
[34:22] clothe with the garment down to the foot
[34:24] and gird about the paps with the golden
[34:26] girdle brother batman one place says
[34:27] that this is even representing the bride
[34:30] which is very easy to understand that
[34:31] she is him so there's a representation
[34:34] of them
[34:35] in their oneness and his head and and
[34:37] his hairs were white like wool as white
[34:40] as snow
[34:42] again you can see even how it's the the
[34:45] same
[34:46] the white head of the uh the wigged one
[34:48] the mighty angel in revelations chapter
[34:50] 10 and his eyes were his flames of fire
[34:52] and his feet like undefined brass as
[34:54] they burned in a furnace in his voice as
[34:56] the sound of many waters this is
[34:58] describing uh this christ one likened to
[35:01] the son of man
[35:03] we know this is christ
[35:05] it's a sim it's symbolic of christ
[35:07] in the midst of his church through seven
[35:09] church ages because verse 20 comes to
[35:11] tell us the seven candlesticks are the
[35:13] seven churches that are in asia so these
[35:15] these seven golden candlesticks
[35:17] represent in the gentile ages the seven
[35:20] gentile churches through seven church
[35:22] ages and this depiction of this one in
[35:26] the midst of the seven golden
[35:27] candlesticks shows that christ was in
[35:30] his church in every age
[35:34] all the way all the way up to the
[35:35] seventh age here he is in the midst of
[35:37] his church
[35:38] in the midst of her in the midst of them
[35:40] and so these seven golden candlesticks
[35:42] with christ in the midst of them it's
[35:44] christ in the midst of his church
[35:47] but what are we reading in revelations 3
[35:48] 20
[35:50] a different description
[35:52] now let's uh let's think about this
[35:54] imagery that's being described in
[35:56] revelations one the seven golden
[35:57] candlesticks correspond
[35:59] to the seven lamps that are in the
[36:01] sanctuary
[36:02] so if we were
[36:04] if we were wanting to focus on maybe the
[36:06] type of the tabernacle
[36:08] we could already see that what's
[36:10] happening for john right now as is he's
[36:13] come in from the outer court and he's in
[36:15] the holy place
[36:17] because now he sees the the uh the can
[36:20] seven golden candlesticks which are
[36:22] represented in the tabernacle the seven
[36:24] lamps in the holy place before you get
[36:26] into
[36:27] the holy of holies
[36:29] brother brahm said he said i'm the one
[36:31] that walks in the midst of the seven
[36:32] golden candlesticks and on the last
[36:34] church age here he was on the outside i
[36:37] should have put the quote on the slide
[36:39] so you could read it because that's the
[36:40] image i want you to see here he is in
[36:42] revelations one christ in the midst of
[36:44] the seven golden candlesticks but now at
[36:46] the end of revelations chapter three in
[36:48] the last church age he's on the outside
[36:50] the one that was in the midst is on the
[36:51] outside they kicked him out whereabouts
[36:53] in this laodicean age standing again
[36:56] trying to get back again at his own door
[36:59] to his own church
[37:00] but it talks about how pathetic that is
[37:03] now there is a historical significance
[37:05] there's a symbolic significance just as
[37:08] we could say that there was literal
[37:09] events unfolding at the breaking of the
[37:11] veil but it also signified spiritual
[37:13] things in this imagery that uh
[37:16] that john is describing there's literal
[37:18] things that have transpired but these
[37:19] things are happening in a spiritual
[37:21] sense
[37:22] i want you to see the image of the
[37:24] temple
[37:25] in revelations 1.
[37:27] so let's look at hebrews chapter 9.
[37:29] i'm going to read verses 1 to 5 and then
[37:31] i'll skip to verse 23
[37:33] then verily the first covenant
[37:36] it's uh
[37:37] there was one point i was tempted to
[37:39] just read the entire book of hebrews to
[37:41] you
[37:43] just hoping that somehow some way we
[37:44] could kind of just see the picture
[37:46] uh come out in 3d as we read it because
[37:48] it's it's amazing just how much depth
[37:52] paul goes into to proving who christ was
[37:55] by their own law
[37:57] by their own images by their own
[37:58] symbolism by their own traditions by the
[38:00] own arrangement of the tabernacle shall
[38:02] christ fulfill it christ will feel that
[38:03] christ will feel that christ fulfilled
[38:04] it
[38:05] says then verily the first covenant had
[38:08] also ordinance as divine service that
[38:09] would be the old testament the old
[38:10] covenant the first covenant had
[38:12] ordinance of divine service and a
[38:13] worldly sanctuary
[38:16] there's that's sanctuary thing now for
[38:18] there was a tabernacle made the first
[38:20] wearing was the candlestick and the
[38:22] table and the showbread which is called
[38:25] the sanctuary see the outer court then
[38:27] you had the sanctuary which called also
[38:29] the holy place and in there's the
[38:31] candlestick the table the showbread and
[38:34] is also going to be the golden altar the
[38:36] altar of incense is in the sanctuary and
[38:38] after the second veil
[38:40] so there was a uh they called it
[38:42] a a gate i believe into the outer courts
[38:45] and then there was a a door the first
[38:47] veil or the first door into the
[38:49] sanctuary but now the second veil the
[38:51] tabernacle which is called the holiest
[38:54] of all
[38:55] paul's wanting us to see this image
[38:57] so he says which had the golden sensor
[39:00] and the ark of the covenant overlaid
[39:02] roundabout with gold wherein was the
[39:03] golden pot that had manna and aaron's
[39:05] rod that butted and the tables of the
[39:07] covenant and over the cherubims of glory
[39:10] shadowing the mercy seat of which we
[39:11] cannot now speak particularly it must
[39:14] have been a mystery there
[39:16] that he wanted to share he's described
[39:17] the sanctuary and now what he calls the
[39:20] tabernacle which is called the holiest
[39:23] of all not just the sanctuary but this
[39:25] place behind the veil where is the ark
[39:28] of the covenant
[39:30] and overlaid with gold skip to verse 23
[39:34] as he's established this image he says
[39:36] it was therefore necessary that the
[39:38] pattern of things in the heavens should
[39:40] be purified with these
[39:42] but the heavenly these the heavenly
[39:44] things themselves with better sacrifices
[39:46] than these because he's talking about
[39:48] how the natural the the things that were
[39:50] in the image of the heavenly war were
[39:52] consecrated or sanctified with blood
[39:54] they were sprinkled with blood and these
[39:56] things were literally happening to the
[39:58] jews and their church ages and their
[40:00] traditions are in their doctrine and
[40:01] their belief in their system but he's
[40:04] saying but then the things that are
[40:06] heavenly are themselves
[40:09] sanctified or purified with a better
[40:11] sacrifice than that of bullocks and rams
[40:13] and lambs
[40:15] so he shows us the better sacrifice
[40:17] for christ is not entered into the holy
[40:19] places made with hands
[40:22] christ has not come into the sanctuary
[40:24] at the table of showbread and
[40:26] candlesticks and a golden altar or he
[40:29] hasn't just come into behind be through
[40:31] a linen a veil a curtain
[40:34] made with hands four inches thick top to
[40:37] bottom uh very very heavy men had to
[40:39] carry it many men it had it was was not
[40:42] easily moved he says christ has not
[40:44] entered into the sanctuary or even the
[40:46] the uh the holiest of all which are the
[40:49] figures of the true
[40:52] so the sanctuary and the holiest of all
[40:55] or the the holy place and the holy of
[40:57] holies are the most holy place they
[41:00] symbolize and represented something that
[41:02] was literal as well
[41:05] but he says they're figures of the true
[41:08] remember i don't think i had them here i
[41:10] might come to it here in a moment
[41:12] where moses makes the tabernacle after
[41:14] the pattern that he saw
[41:17] and so there was a representation of
[41:18] these things in heaven and earth that
[41:20] the tabernacle is supposed to represent
[41:23] just as the tabernacle has outer court
[41:25] inner court and a holy of holies
[41:28] that even represents the man
[41:30] the three part of the man the three
[41:32] three
[41:33] parts of the person body spirit soul so
[41:35] christ is entered into that which are
[41:38] uh not the ones the holy place is made
[41:40] with hands
[41:42] but which are figures of the true but
[41:43] into heaven itself
[41:45] so catch that here's christ the high
[41:48] priest
[41:49] the fulfillment of what all those things
[41:50] pointed to it says he's entered into
[41:54] heaven itself now to appear in the
[41:57] presence of god for us so he draws this
[42:00] image just as the high priest once a
[42:01] year on the day of atonement would come
[42:03] in behind that veil i himself have him
[42:06] in the it's called the anointed priest
[42:07] the anoint the one that is anointed the
[42:08] one that is anointed he had to make a
[42:10] sacrifice for himself he had to dress a
[42:11] particular way he had to be uh covered
[42:14] uh and prepared to go in there and they
[42:16] made preparation just in case he didn't
[42:17] do it all right
[42:19] there's no more bells ringing tug on the
[42:20] rope all right we lost them drag them
[42:22] out
[42:24] uh there's a ah this image now paul is
[42:27] saying that christ has not just done
[42:30] what these natural priests have done but
[42:32] now the high priest after the order of
[42:34] melchizedek has not entered into holy
[42:36] places made with hands he hasn't just
[42:38] merely come to a sanctuary and then is
[42:40] the holiest of all but he is now entered
[42:42] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[42:45] presence of god
[42:46] now catch what paul is doing he's
[42:48] distinguishing between the sanctuary and
[42:50] the holy of holies
[42:52] and that veil and i think lord one i'll
[42:54] just spend more time on the veil and
[42:56] other services because i just feel
[42:57] really uh
[42:59] impressed that there's just so much more
[43:01] for us to look at in this but the veil
[43:03] in the temple separated the priest
[43:06] from the holy place where god's shekinah
[43:08] glory was and it was a veil of
[43:09] protection
[43:11] because if you entered into that
[43:13] improperly you would die
[43:15] and the veil then was a barrier between
[43:17] god and man it was a barrier between god
[43:19] and the high priest it was a place where
[43:20] god dwelt and it was there to keep god
[43:23] to mark off where god was so it held god
[43:27] the veil held god and god dwelt there
[43:30] and god was arrested behind that so the
[43:33] veil is
[43:34] the holding in of something but then the
[43:37] veil has another effect of keeping
[43:39] something away
[43:42] and so in when paul is separating out
[43:44] the sanctuary
[43:46] from the holy of holies and maybe you
[43:48] should have said this in the beginning i
[43:49] hope you're really really focusing
[43:51] if i could use a carnal type this is
[43:54] like a counting 101.
[43:56] if you miss a day
[43:58] of accounting 101 when you're in college
[44:01] you might as well just drop the course
[44:03] that's what i did
[44:05] because i missed a couple classes i was
[44:08] going to louisiana youth camp this very
[44:10] weekend so many years ago and i got back
[44:12] to class i'm like wait what what are we
[44:13] doing now what is this did i am i have
[44:15] the wrong class because it just all
[44:16] built
[44:17] or i don't you had to know what you had
[44:18] to know was on tuesday to get was
[44:20] if you're just now listening
[44:22] enjoy the the manner
[44:25] okay
[44:26] and i'll maybe try to use more hand
[44:28] gestures and and work work the platform
[44:31] a little bit better to keep you engaged
[44:32] but i hope you've been focusing this far
[44:34] because everything i've said everything
[44:37] i've said have been very deliberate
[44:38] about even if i can't put the
[44:40] make make the point that all the pieces
[44:42] are just being laid out every single one
[44:43] of these and hopefully at one point what
[44:45] happens is all sudden you see
[44:48] because they're starting to just all
[44:49] come here paul is saying that there was
[44:51] a first covenant old testament old
[44:53] covenant
[44:54] that in that covenant there was a
[44:55] sanctuary and a holy of holies sanctuary
[44:59] holy place or what he called the holiest
[45:01] of all there's a veil that separates
[45:03] those two one's the sanctuary but when
[45:05] he says that christ is now entering into
[45:10] heaven itself
[45:12] there's an image that's being expressed
[45:15] tabernacle was arranged to tell the
[45:17] story of redemption
[45:19] in earth and in heaven
[45:23] i've read this to you before in the
[45:24] jewish writings i said the structure of
[45:25] the tabernacle corresponds to the
[45:27] structure of heaven and earth
[45:30] the tabernacle below like was likewise
[45:32] made after the pattern of the
[45:34] supernatural tabernacle in all of its
[45:36] details
[45:37] so there was a dwelling place of god
[45:40] there was a spiritual image that god had
[45:42] in his mind remember genesis chapter 1
[45:44] verse 1 in the beginning god created the
[45:46] heaven and the earth
[45:48] god right there just put all the
[45:49] elements of redemption right in front of
[45:51] us
[45:51] told the story of redemption a heavenly
[45:53] bridegroom and an earthly bride it's all
[45:55] laid out there
[45:56] and he told us that the bride was gonna
[45:58] be in chaos and his word had to bring
[46:00] order he tells all that in the first few
[46:01] words of his book first few verses of
[46:03] his book so in the beginning god created
[46:05] the heaven and the earth you have the
[46:07] dwelling place of god you have the place
[46:09] where the bride's going to be raised up
[46:11] but he's also portraying in words what
[46:13] the tabernacle is going to represent
[46:17] i know a lot of you are familiar with
[46:18] josephus
[46:20] and in his writings
[46:22] he presented the tabernacle as
[46:23] portraying creation
[46:25] he said the tabernacle represents
[46:27] creation in three parts and the outer
[46:30] parts of the outer court and the holy
[46:31] place or the sanctuary
[46:33] represented land and sea
[46:35] but then the holy of holies he uses this
[46:37] phrase a heaven peculiar to god
[46:41] because the priest would be in the
[46:42] sanctuary where there was a man-made
[46:44] light the candlesticks and they would be
[46:46] offering a sacrifice and instance
[46:48] performing their service and it was a
[46:49] consecrated place but there was one
[46:51] place that was separated out where god
[46:53] dwelled and there his presence would be
[46:55] as chicano glory would be and to go in
[46:57] there not properly dress and just for
[46:59] anyone to go in there with certain death
[47:02] because it was a heaven peculiar to god
[47:04] that is where the father is that is
[47:05] where god is he is in heaven
[47:08] and so this jewish in jewish tradition
[47:11] you have the most holy place the holiest
[47:14] of all
[47:15] and there's a veil that that separates
[47:18] the sanctuary the high priest and the
[47:21] service of men from the presence of god
[47:23] and this veil and jewish tradition
[47:26] symbolized the sky
[47:29] even you could even as i think even
[47:30] josephus calls it the panorama of the
[47:32] entire heavens
[47:35] in captivity it was a babylonian
[47:36] tapestry i thought that was really
[47:38] remarkable for the end time type
[47:40] because it's a babylonian denominational
[47:42] veil that needs to be torn down
[47:44] and so thanks brother josephus for that
[47:47] and they
[47:49] in this
[47:50] and even the colors if you look at the
[47:51] colors in the in the bible the colors
[47:53] were associated with the color of the
[47:55] sky
[47:56] that even the elements and the images
[47:58] and the things that were on it was this
[48:00] representation that this is the sky
[48:03] and this these are the heavens and god
[48:05] dwells in heaven his throne is in heaven
[48:08] his presence is in heaven and so even in
[48:11] genesis chapter one when he gets begins
[48:12] to get into creation he divides the
[48:15] firmament from the heaven and he is
[48:17] dividing the earth and the firmament
[48:19] from the heaven he's making these
[48:20] distinctions and he has a veil there
[48:23] and he puts these barriers that's going
[48:24] to separate the heavens god was putting
[48:27] in these layers to separate the heaven
[48:29] from the earth and so to a jew they saw
[48:31] the veil as being symbolic of the
[48:33] heavens that hid god
[48:36] in psalms 11 4 the lord is in his holy
[48:38] temple
[48:40] it says the lord's throne is in heaven
[48:43] and this is a statement this is the
[48:44] phrase when josephus is writing on the
[48:46] war he says thus the veil which screamed
[48:48] the holy of holies was also the boundary
[48:51] between earth and heaven
[48:54] right because the sanctuary could get
[48:55] cloudy
[48:56] all right could this the the the
[48:59] man-made light the lamp stand it had to
[49:01] be maintained
[49:02] all right the table show bread the altar
[49:04] of incense these there's men doing
[49:06] service i'm i'm having again this is
[49:08] like this is a 5 000 level course
[49:12] right this is your masters i can preach
[49:14] this on an easter morning to message
[49:15] believers there's a lot of things you
[49:17] already know that i'm capitalizing on
[49:19] these elements in the sanctuary in the
[49:21] holy place are relate to the earthly
[49:24] things in man but then once you go
[49:25] beyond the veil everything portrays
[49:28] deity
[49:29] god
[49:30] heaven
[49:33] and in
[49:34] in the ordinances
[49:36] there were different offerings that men
[49:37] would perform
[49:40] on a regular basis in the sanctuary
[49:42] but in leviticus 16 which god said this
[49:44] you'll keep
[49:46] on the tenth day of the seventh month
[49:48] forever as a memorial
[49:50] he's calling it it's the day of
[49:52] atonement where once a year a high
[49:53] priest entered through that veil
[49:57] that curtain into
[49:59] what paul says the most holy place
[50:01] the holy of holies
[50:04] so when the priest did it the high
[50:06] priest did it once a year
[50:08] as as the as in their oral tradition the
[50:11] veil
[50:12] screened the holy of holies it was a
[50:14] boundary between earth and heaven
[50:16] and so the high priest
[50:19] when he would go from the sanctuary and
[50:21] go behind that veil it was as if he was
[50:23] leaving the earth
[50:25] and entering into heaven
[50:27] even with the very language that's used
[50:29] to describe what's happening when the
[50:31] high priest enters in there and says and
[50:32] there's no man there
[50:34] there's some that even take it to say
[50:35] there's been a tran transition of the
[50:37] person where he's no longer human but
[50:40] now he's divine and by the blood this is
[50:42] that's beautiful by the blood now he
[50:45] crosses through that veil we'll come to
[50:46] it a little bit that veil would have
[50:48] already been sprinkled with blood
[50:50] i don't know how many times i tried to
[50:51] imagine what it would have smelt like
[50:53] but he walked in through that veil and
[50:55] he comes in and now it's as if he's
[50:58] entered into heaven
[50:59] because he's coming into the presence of
[51:01] jehovah before the mercy seat which was
[51:04] a symbol of heaven which is
[51:05] representative of heaven so this is a
[51:06] very supernatural thing it wouldn't be
[51:08] hard for us to imagine that right
[51:10] because you're seated here in heavenly
[51:11] places
[51:12] right already right now seated in heavy
[51:14] places so this high priest then when he
[51:16] entered in behind that veil there's this
[51:18] great spiritual transition translation a
[51:21] temporary resurrection to her now he's
[51:23] coming in behind the veil and he's
[51:25] entered into the presence of jehovah and
[51:27] heaven as it were heaven and tight but
[51:29] then paul says christ has entered into
[51:32] the holy of holies he says as into
[51:34] heaven itself why because it was
[51:37] imagined and it was represented in the
[51:38] sacrifices in the temple but now he says
[51:41] christ has entered into the heaven
[51:42] itself now to appear in the presence of
[51:44] god for us so there's the sacrifice
[51:47] there's the high priest there's the
[51:48] blood there's the mercy seat there's the
[51:51] shekinah glory on top of it it's all
[51:54] represented in that union between god
[51:56] and his son and the sacrifice of christ
[52:00] he's entered into heaven itself nice and
[52:02] he's literally not just what was
[52:04] represented in the tabernacle and the
[52:06] sanctuary into the holy place but now
[52:08] christ has done it what it represented
[52:14] my
[52:18] revelations 3 20 then
[52:19] behold i stand at the door knock
[52:22] what's representing that image then
[52:24] remember
[52:25] how we arrived there
[52:27] is the breaking of the veil
[52:29] was the ceasing of jerusalem i'm just
[52:32] trying to catch us all back up the break
[52:34] in the bill was the ceasing of jerusalem
[52:35] brother man says it's going to happen
[52:36] again in the end time when he's put out
[52:38] of the camp according to revelations 3
[52:40] 20.
[52:40] and in revelations 3 20
[52:43] there is christ is pushed out of the
[52:45] church
[52:47] and so he was that that in the church
[52:49] was represented the sanctuary
[52:51] seven golden candlesticks christ just
[52:54] pushed out so paul uses those very same
[52:56] images to describe how the high priest
[52:58] would be in the sanctuary and then he
[53:00] would enter in behind the veil into
[53:01] heaven and type to offer that sacrifice
[53:04] on the day of atonement and then he says
[53:06] but christ has not entered into the
[53:07] sanctuary or even behind that veil into
[53:09] the holy place but he's entered into
[53:10] heaven itself as the sacrifice once and
[53:13] for all
[53:15] in the presence of god for us
[53:19] and so then we come back to our type of
[53:21] our time in our day behold i
[53:23] stand at the door knock
[53:26] the church has separated itself from
[53:27] christ
[53:28] so there's a transition that's taken
[53:30] place
[53:30] just like at the crucifixion when
[53:32] brother brahma says jerusalem is ceasing
[53:34] and at the crucifixion it changes the
[53:36] old system is done
[53:38] so it was in effect until that hour
[53:41] right jerusalem is ceasing in effect to
[53:43] that hour crucifixion it changes the old
[53:45] system is done
[53:47] why because the sacrificial lamb
[53:49] has
[53:51] there's there's something that's changed
[53:52] in relation to the mercy seat something
[53:55] changed in relation to where the
[53:56] shekinah glory is
[53:58] so brother adam in that very statement i
[54:00] was reading to you earlier the lamb the
[54:02] sacrificial lamb was on the ground
[54:03] jerusalem was ceased it was effective
[54:04] this hour he says god be blessed for
[54:06] seeing this wonderful heavenly light in
[54:08] this last day because the churches are
[54:10] doing the same thing today
[54:13] what what was the church doing in the
[54:14] days of his first coming crucifying
[54:17] christ he's hanging on the cross but
[54:19] what did it represent their time is over
[54:21] until the hour that organized organized
[54:23] religion organization religion is
[54:25] condemned and proved to be sacrificing
[54:27] christ's word from then on comes the
[54:28] word and the word only from the old
[54:31] paschal lamb passed away and christ
[54:33] became our lamb at the day of the
[54:35] crucifixion and the day so there's the
[54:37] there's the transition then
[54:40] at the end of the jewish ages when the
[54:42] breath is expired it shows as his life
[54:45] is given out it's fulfilled all the
[54:47] shadows and types of the law christ is
[54:48] the end of the law so the veil of the
[54:50] temple is rent showing this system is
[54:53] done it's over here he hangs on a cross
[54:56] that's the duke that's the new mercy
[54:58] seat
[55:01] so he says and the day that the
[55:03] denomination crucified the word of god
[55:05] and accepted a creed instead of the word
[55:07] that's the day the word come into full
[55:09] effect that's just been recently
[55:13] what would have been recent in july 7
[55:15] 1963 the opening of the seven seals
[55:19] that's the significant event that it
[55:20] transpired he says that's just been
[55:22] recently so when these things transpire
[55:25] and the revelation is giving then it's
[55:28] it's opening up something to where
[55:29] brother branham could say that what the
[55:31] jewish church did to christ christ's
[55:34] church is now done to him in the end of
[55:37] the gentile ages
[55:40] and but notice
[55:42] just as christ is being crucified
[55:45] and his breath leaves he's forever
[55:47] consecrated a new covenant
[55:49] so he said oh he died well he's but he
[55:51] by his blood the shedding of his blood
[55:53] he's consecrated a new covenant
[55:55] a new testament
[55:58] and there it exposes the old system but
[56:02] something new
[56:04] is being born
[56:07] and going beyond the camp
[56:09] brother man says the son of david a few
[56:10] hundred years after that set on the same
[56:12] hill and wet because he was the rejected
[56:14] king among his own people it's christ
[56:16] always
[56:22] talking about david feeling rejected
[56:25] then christ the son of david is rejected
[56:29] and today when it's prophesied that
[56:30] christ must come into the camp you know
[56:32] what happened so now he's got us today
[56:35] it's be it'd be just exactly like it was
[56:37] then
[56:38] it's got to be that way to fulfill what
[56:40] the word here promises he will do
[56:42] now remember christ was in the age of
[56:44] noah that was christ jesus christ the
[56:45] saying yesterday forever the rejected
[56:48] word of the hour
[56:50] notice and his prophecy of revelations 3
[56:53] revelations 3 20 is prophecy then
[56:56] when he come in the last days as he
[56:58] prophesied he would come in this last
[57:00] days and how did he find the church at
[57:02] laodicea rich have need of nothing said
[57:04] as a queen and can see no sorrow
[57:06] and put him outside the church prophecy
[57:09] in revelations 3 of the laodicean age
[57:11] when he would come he would be put
[57:13] outside the church had no use for him he
[57:16] went without the camp again
[57:20] where does that place just think of this
[57:22] where does that place christ in this
[57:24] moment what images are being brought
[57:27] here he's veiled again
[57:30] once again or he says he's failed i'll
[57:32] say this once again there's been a
[57:33] system established in a pattern of the
[57:35] real
[57:36] a false vine
[57:38] and in in that there they it appears to
[57:41] be the real genuine thing
[57:44] but god is saying i'm not in there
[57:47] i'm not in it
[57:48] but don't we do this don't we do that
[57:50] don't we do but i'm not in it
[57:55] now
[57:56] if you could with me
[57:58] um
[58:01] i'm just over halfway through we're good
[58:05] now i want the image in the picture just
[58:07] to get very very stark to you i want it
[58:09] to be very focused now
[58:11] so on calvary christ is hanging on the
[58:13] cross
[58:15] deity
[58:16] is dripping with blood
[58:19] his life is being poured out
[58:22] and he cries with a loud voice
[58:24] and the breaking of the veil the loosing
[58:26] of that curtain exposed that god
[58:29] had left their temple
[58:33] and at that moment the old veils tore
[58:34] apart and the system's done right at
[58:37] that moment it's like who's ever going
[58:39] to go back to that
[58:41] you could see your testimony right
[58:44] if you were if you were dragging a lamb
[58:45] up there that day and you come to find
[58:46] out there's wait we don't even have an
[58:48] arc wait there's no presence of god
[58:49] behind that veil why would i ever go
[58:51] back to this church
[58:53] right there's something exposed that was
[58:55] lacking
[58:56] but god god doesn't ever just tear down
[58:58] something
[59:00] if he doesn't have something
[59:03] uh else just as we see it's all in the
[59:05] parable
[59:06] of the who is who is my neighbor
[59:09] that there's a lot of times we act like
[59:10] thieves because we strip people of their
[59:12] religion we strip them of their beliefs
[59:14] we strip them of their comforts but we
[59:15] don't give them anything else
[59:19] so at the very moment that the old
[59:21] system is proved to be wrong it was a
[59:24] good to that moment
[59:26] there's a new veil
[59:28] right
[59:29] because he's consecrated a new covenant
[59:32] the old veil had been abolished
[59:35] the old veil
[59:37] had been removed but then there i want
[59:39] you i want to use this language and
[59:40] maybe i'm just seeding something for
[59:42] later the new veil a new veil was raised
[59:45] up
[59:46] because in the message the unveiling of
[59:48] god brother and says god is always
[59:49] behind the veil
[59:52] did you know that
[59:53] you know what you're going to see in
[59:54] heaven
[59:56] his son
[59:58] because god is always
[1:00:00] always behind the veil he said god is
[1:00:02] hid from the public so god is not into a
[1:00:04] public show
[1:00:06] even when the most remarkable
[1:00:08] significant most sublime things are
[1:00:10] going to happen god isn't going to do it
[1:00:12] as a 900 foot jesus god is not going to
[1:00:14] do it as a pie in this guy god's not
[1:00:16] going to do it openly it won't be a
[1:00:18] public show it will always be hid behind
[1:00:20] something humble even if it seems like
[1:00:22] it's within a great big cathedral it'll
[1:00:24] always be something very small something
[1:00:26] private something intimate because god
[1:00:28] does not clown for the devil god is
[1:00:31] always hid from the public
[1:00:34] he's always behind the veil
[1:00:36] in hebrews chapter 10
[1:00:38] verses 19 to 22 having therefore
[1:00:41] brethren boldness
[1:00:42] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[1:00:45] of jesus now this is this is blasphemy
[1:00:48] to a jew but this what he's saying is
[1:00:50] hey you know that carpenter you guys
[1:00:51] crucified you know that blood you shed
[1:00:54] that was shed and that one that you say
[1:00:55] the disciples stole his body because he
[1:00:58] died and shed his blood but my
[1:01:00] confession that he died for my sins and
[1:01:02] the returning of his spirit upon me i
[1:01:04] have been anointed to enter in behind
[1:01:07] the veil to come before the mercy seat
[1:01:10] into the presence of god and a jew
[1:01:12] begins to rip his garments and blasphemy
[1:01:15] and pull out his curls
[1:01:18] but he's saying
[1:01:19] we have boldness to enter the whole list
[1:01:21] by the blood of jesus by a new and
[1:01:23] living way
[1:01:25] which he hath consecrated for us notice
[1:01:28] through the veil
[1:01:29] that is to say his flesh
[1:01:33] the the way the way to in there he
[1:01:36] consecrated it through the veil that is
[1:01:38] his flesh and having a high priest over
[1:01:40] the house of god christ
[1:01:42] who has what entered into heaven itself
[1:01:45] now to appear in the presence of god for
[1:01:46] us now having this high priest let us
[1:01:49] draw near with the true heart and full
[1:01:51] assurance of faith having our hearts
[1:01:54] sprinkled from an evil conscience so now
[1:01:56] we like the elements of the tabernacle
[1:01:58] we likewise are being sprinkled he says
[1:02:00] our hearts being sprinkled uh from an
[1:02:02] evil conscience and where is the tablet
[1:02:04] of testimony it's written in your heart
[1:02:07] now it's sprinkled with the blood and
[1:02:08] our body's washed with pure water he's
[1:02:11] putting us in the very what steps of the
[1:02:14] high priest who is cleaned and washed
[1:02:16] and anointed and has the right to stand
[1:02:19] before the shekinah glory
[1:02:25] so one one veil was abolished when he
[1:02:27] cried with a loud voice and it rent the
[1:02:30] veil of the natural tabernacle the
[1:02:31] natural temple but there still was
[1:02:33] another veil
[1:02:35] because he said it was the veil of his
[1:02:37] flesh
[1:02:38] that forever consecrated the way now i
[1:02:41] recognize it in some way maybe we're
[1:02:43] using veil in a different sense but
[1:02:45] they're connected
[1:02:48] it's kind of that paradox nature of the
[1:02:49] veil that brother brown begins to talk
[1:02:51] about in the end time but there was a
[1:02:52] veil that was written that was torn that
[1:02:54] exposed that veil was covering nothing
[1:02:57] it hid nothing but a stone
[1:03:00] the foundation stone i think is what
[1:03:02] they call the the founding stone
[1:03:04] with the connected to creation connected
[1:03:07] to different things in the garden and
[1:03:08] they they say that in their later
[1:03:09] tradition after the captivity after the
[1:03:11] ark of the covenant was gone they
[1:03:13] sprinkled the blood upon this stone they
[1:03:15] at least were trying to be sincere with
[1:03:16] what they had
[1:03:17] if you can't get a full ark
[1:03:19] get it get a slice
[1:03:23] and now
[1:03:25] this veil
[1:03:26] of his flesh
[1:03:28] it was a bloody veil
[1:03:31] covered in blood
[1:03:33] and leviticus 4 it goes through sin
[1:03:36] offerings
[1:03:37] and have have you anybody ever kind of
[1:03:39] sat down and tried to figure out the
[1:03:40] feast and the sacrifices and which ones
[1:03:42] which and which you know it just all
[1:03:45] points to christ right
[1:03:47] just i want to just see jesus christ
[1:03:49] in all of them because you've got grain
[1:03:51] offerings and you have burnt offerings
[1:03:53] and you have some that are done this way
[1:03:55] and you have turtle dubs and you have
[1:03:56] this this and you have the scapegoat and
[1:03:59] you have all these different things like
[1:04:00] well which ones which one well you're
[1:04:02] not gonna be able to figure it out with
[1:04:02] all the different people just all
[1:04:04] somehow in some way expresses what
[1:04:05] christ has done for us
[1:04:07] it's all forward-looking in a way that's
[1:04:09] pointing to something so in leviticus 4
[1:04:12] you have the sin offerings if a leader
[1:04:14] sinned of a high priest if the people
[1:04:16] sinned if they said ignorantly there was
[1:04:18] things that they could do to bring the
[1:04:19] blood and a sacrifice in a bullock and
[1:04:21] that blood would be shed and it would be
[1:04:23] sprinkled upon
[1:04:24] the altar but then this notice in verse
[1:04:26] 17 leviticus 4 17 and the priest shall
[1:04:29] dip his finger in some of the blood
[1:04:31] and sprinkle it seven times before the
[1:04:34] lord
[1:04:35] even before the veil
[1:04:38] so the
[1:04:39] the veil
[1:04:42] in
[1:04:44] the
[1:04:45] would be
[1:04:46] uh
[1:04:47] covering the ark of the covenant
[1:04:49] covering that room that contained the
[1:04:51] which was the most holy place which was
[1:04:52] the scatter course kind of going where
[1:04:54] the lord dwelt so he would stand before
[1:04:57] it
[1:04:58] and he would take the blood and he would
[1:04:59] sprinkle it
[1:05:01] says before
[1:05:02] the veil
[1:05:04] and in the language of other
[1:05:05] translations and in the and the
[1:05:07] tradition
[1:05:08] he would be doing it to the veil towards
[1:05:10] the and it would be on the veil of the
[1:05:12] sanctuary he would actually be
[1:05:14] sprinkling the blood the veil with the
[1:05:17] blood of the sacrifice and so the veil
[1:05:20] then had blood that had been scattered
[1:05:22] was placed upon it blood placed upon
[1:05:25] that veil
[1:05:26] and so this veil is a bloody veil that
[1:05:29] hangs in the natural tabernacle pla
[1:05:31] keeping the blood uh the the mercy seat
[1:05:34] hid
[1:05:35] from the people in the sanctuary
[1:05:39] still a bloody veil that keeps people
[1:05:42] from seeing them
[1:05:44] in second corinthians chapter 3 verses
[1:05:46] 13 and 14. i am going to come back to
[1:05:48] some of these things on this because i
[1:05:49] wanted to read much more
[1:05:51] if you recall we've been reading from
[1:05:53] 2nd corinthians 3 a lot in terms of the
[1:05:55] new testament able ministers of this new
[1:05:57] covenant
[1:05:58] and there's there's a lot in this entire
[1:06:01] chapter you can draw from but now the
[1:06:03] veil comes into view again because this
[1:06:05] is the function of a veil he says and
[1:06:06] not as moses which put a veil over his
[1:06:08] face that the children of israel could
[1:06:10] not steadfastly look to the end of that
[1:06:12] which is abolished
[1:06:14] they what was abolished the laws the
[1:06:16] sacrifices the ordinances and they moses
[1:06:19] himself
[1:06:20] after he had gone into the presence of
[1:06:22] god he'd go in the presence of god
[1:06:23] remove the veil
[1:06:24] come back out put the veil on to talk to
[1:06:26] the people
[1:06:27] he was already symbolizing before the
[1:06:29] tabernacle was even built that the
[1:06:31] children of israel couldn't look upon
[1:06:33] them
[1:06:34] why because moses became a god to the
[1:06:36] people and i kind of may be getting more
[1:06:37] into it than i wanted to but there's a
[1:06:39] veil is there to symbolize something to
[1:06:41] represent this was duplicated and
[1:06:43] replicated even in the tabernacle
[1:06:46] but their minds were blinded for even
[1:06:48] and we've read this recently for until
[1:06:50] this day remaineth the same veil
[1:06:53] untaken away
[1:06:56] the same veil
[1:06:57] not
[1:06:58] unveiled the same veil remaineth the
[1:07:01] same veil untaken away not unfolded in
[1:07:04] the reading of the old testament so they
[1:07:05] read the old testament which points to
[1:07:07] christ but the veil is still standing
[1:07:10] between them
[1:07:12] and the scene of christ but he says
[1:07:14] which veil is done away in christ
[1:07:18] so the veil that kept mo the glory that
[1:07:21] was upon moses's face for the people one
[1:07:23] is hit that veil is taken away don't be
[1:07:25] afraid to look into his glory when it
[1:07:27] comes to the veil before the shekinah
[1:07:29] glory that veil is done away with christ
[1:07:32] so paul says we have boldness to enter
[1:07:35] the holiest by the blood of jesus why
[1:07:37] there's been a consecrated new and
[1:07:39] living way and we are washed with that
[1:07:41] blood and we have a right to come before
[1:07:43] christ raised seated together with them
[1:07:45] in heavenly places because that veil
[1:07:48] that separated man from the sanctuary
[1:07:50] from the the dwelling place of god has
[1:07:53] been done away in christ
[1:07:56] so christ did away with one veil but
[1:07:59] christ himself is a veil
[1:08:01] because he said he did away with that
[1:08:03] veil
[1:08:04] through the veil that is his flesh
[1:08:07] so he took one bloody veil and tore it
[1:08:09] down but what was hanging on the cross
[1:08:12] another bloody veil
[1:08:15] so the break-in of the veil
[1:08:17] signifies
[1:08:19] an exposure right exposing of the
[1:08:22] jerusalem systems that we're ceasing
[1:08:24] exposure of something that is bankrupt
[1:08:25] something is godless something that is
[1:08:27] bloodless that god is no longer in
[1:08:28] there's no life in it
[1:08:30] but this is the last part i want to
[1:08:31] share with you
[1:08:33] is that it also
[1:08:35] is a great revealing
[1:08:37] and an unveiling
[1:08:40] christ is there on the on the on the
[1:08:43] cross
[1:08:44] as the mercy seat
[1:08:46] in plain view
[1:08:48] and they're looking right at it
[1:08:50] the same way they would be looking at a
[1:08:52] bloody veil in the sanctuary
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:54] same way
[1:08:56] billy bran now so this what i want you
[1:08:58] to see is that when christ when the veil
[1:08:59] was torn
[1:09:01] it was there was an opening up
[1:09:04] an opportunity is there an it
[1:09:06] opportunity for advancement
[1:09:09] but i said the opening veil on that day
[1:09:11] at calvary revealed the way to the total
[1:09:13] victory
[1:09:15] the open of the veil revealed the way
[1:09:18] so that's what i wanted to amplify for a
[1:09:19] few more moments now the opening of the
[1:09:21] veil is a revealing
[1:09:23] it opened up the way between the
[1:09:25] sanctuary which was the earth
[1:09:27] and heaven which was the presence of god
[1:09:30] it was opening up away
[1:09:32] so in mark so on the on the cross
[1:09:36] as he cries out with the loud voice it
[1:09:38] says the veil of the temple was rent it
[1:09:40] was divided it was separated
[1:09:43] it was opened up
[1:09:45] now notice this in mark chapter 1 verses
[1:09:47] 9 to 11.
[1:09:49] and it came to pass in those days that
[1:09:51] jesus came from nazareth under galilee
[1:09:53] and was baptized by john and jordan now
[1:09:56] now watch what's going to happen here i
[1:09:57] think this is very
[1:09:59] very important it might seem a little
[1:10:00] bit disjointed i apologize that's that's
[1:10:02] entirely on me because i'm the one
[1:10:03] that's been up here preaching for an
[1:10:04] hour and ten minutes
[1:10:06] because in straight way now so
[1:10:08] jesus comes to john and straightway
[1:10:10] coming up out of the water so what's
[1:10:11] happening
[1:10:12] we know the dialogue between them two
[1:10:13] jesus is baptized by john and as he's
[1:10:16] coming up out of the water he saw the
[1:10:18] heavens opened
[1:10:20] now remember what the tabernacle
[1:10:22] represented
[1:10:23] and how you had the sanctuary which was
[1:10:25] the earth you had the outer courts and
[1:10:27] the sanctuary land and sea and now as
[1:10:30] this one comes from the land and to the
[1:10:32] water and now there's an opening as he's
[1:10:35] in the water he sees the heavens open
[1:10:38] and the spirit like a dove descending
[1:10:40] upon him
[1:10:42] and there came a voice from heaven
[1:10:43] saying thou art my beloved son in whom
[1:10:46] i'm well-pleased
[1:10:49] this is now this whole image i know
[1:10:51] we're very familiar with it but it says
[1:10:53] he saw the heavens open that could have
[1:10:55] just as easily been read
[1:10:57] translated to i saw the heavens rent
[1:10:59] because it's the same word
[1:11:01] so just as the veil the temple was
[1:11:03] ripped into and you could see into the
[1:11:07] the the holy place the most holy place
[1:11:09] the holiest of all and you could see
[1:11:11] that there was no mercy seat there was
[1:11:13] no shekinah glory there was nothing
[1:11:14] there and then on calvary there's the
[1:11:17] new veil that's hanging there upon the
[1:11:19] cross and he cries with a loud voice
[1:11:21] that veil is rent here he is he's
[1:11:23] standing in the waters and it says
[1:11:25] heaven is opened up
[1:11:27] heaven has been rent and when that opens
[1:11:30] up what gets out
[1:11:33] the spirit descending from heaven the
[1:11:35] spirit like a dove descended upon him
[1:11:37] and a voice comes from heaven so it's
[1:11:39] like a curtain's been opened up a veil
[1:11:41] has been opened up and it looses the
[1:11:43] shekinah glory to come down out of
[1:11:45] heaven and there's a voice tracking
[1:11:46] right behind it thou art my beloved son
[1:11:49] and whom i'm well pleased to dwell god
[1:11:51] announces at this moment i will dwell in
[1:11:54] this tabernacle i will dwell in this
[1:11:57] place this is where i put my name
[1:12:01] oh how does brother branham describe it
[1:12:02] heaven and earth embraced
[1:12:05] right heaven and earth kissed
[1:12:07] that's when the word was made flesh
[1:12:09] that's when god and man this is why
[1:12:11] christ had become the way that he did
[1:12:13] because he looked like an earthly man he
[1:12:15] had this semblance of an earthly man he
[1:12:18] had the earthly lineage he was the root
[1:12:20] and offspring of david he had to be
[1:12:22] connected to the earth but he was also
[1:12:24] the lion of the tribe of judah he had to
[1:12:26] be connected to deity so at his baptism
[1:12:29] heaven opens up and it rinse open and
[1:12:32] the spirit gets out and the chicano
[1:12:34] glory descends upon that body and he's
[1:12:37] joined together with the man and it's
[1:12:39] heaven and earth kissing heaven and
[1:12:42] earth embracing then the word was made
[1:12:44] flesh
[1:12:47] the shekinah glory that was on the ark
[1:12:50] had now settled on another tabernacle
[1:12:54] christ
[1:12:56] and in matthew 27
[1:12:59] the natural
[1:13:00] veil of the temple
[1:13:02] is supernaturally tore open
[1:13:05] and it's the same language
[1:13:08] heaven is opened up
[1:13:10] now the in which the veil represented
[1:13:12] remember what jose brother josephus was
[1:13:14] telling us
[1:13:15] how the the veil itself signified the
[1:13:17] separation between heaven and earth
[1:13:20] and so when heaven opens up it's as if
[1:13:22] that curtain has been removed
[1:13:24] and god joins with all the all the
[1:13:26] symbolism all the types now it's all
[1:13:29] coming together it's all blending it's
[1:13:30] all mixing together and he says this is
[1:13:32] my beloved son in whom i dwell in whom
[1:13:35] i'm pleased to dwell in
[1:13:38] and so when we come forward and that
[1:13:40] natural veil is supernaturally tore open
[1:13:44] catch us at the very same moment that it
[1:13:46] happens
[1:13:49] i'm trying to find
[1:13:50] another place where i wanted to read
[1:13:52] this
[1:13:53] it says
[1:13:55] in matthew 27 54 i think i have that one
[1:13:57] it says now when the centurion so he
[1:13:59] says he cried at the loud voice the veil
[1:14:00] of the temple is rent and what does
[1:14:02] matthew do he takes us on a journey
[1:14:04] so hold on here let me let's back up
[1:14:06] let's go on this journey cries with a
[1:14:08] loud voice come to the temple real quick
[1:14:10] i want to show you something
[1:14:11] see the veil it's been torn
[1:14:13] now watch what just happened as soon as
[1:14:14] that veil was torn let's go forward to
[1:14:16] sunday morning look what it look what
[1:14:17] happened look what it made away for old
[1:14:19] testament saints or reservation let's
[1:14:20] follow them back into jerusalem on
[1:14:21] sunday they've seen them many say now
[1:14:23] let's go back
[1:14:25] he cried a loud voice the veil was torn
[1:14:26] in that very moment when this takes
[1:14:29] place the centurion
[1:14:31] and they that were with him watching
[1:14:33] jesus saw the earthquake
[1:14:35] and those things that were done they
[1:14:36] feared greatly saying
[1:14:38] truly
[1:14:39] this was the son of god and mark it says
[1:14:43] he said the centurion the satarian which
[1:14:45] stood over against him
[1:14:47] saw that he so cried
[1:14:49] and gave up the ghost so now mark
[1:14:50] connects the crying of the voice the
[1:14:53] expiration of life he said truly this
[1:14:55] man was the son of god
[1:14:58] what does the centurion say he says when
[1:15:00] the that veil is torn
[1:15:02] he says the same thing that god said
[1:15:05] when the heavens opened in mark 1
[1:15:07] when the sacrifice was washed when the
[1:15:09] sacrifice came to the water and was
[1:15:12] washed god the heavens opened up and
[1:15:14] that veil was opened up and the shekinah
[1:15:16] glory came down of the heaven upon the
[1:15:19] new mercy seat upon upon christ that was
[1:15:22] going to be the sacrificial lamb he was
[1:15:24] the lamb he was the high priest he was
[1:15:26] the mercy see it was all pointing to
[1:15:28] christ it was going to be satisfied in
[1:15:31] one god said this is my son this is the
[1:15:35] son of god and then on the cross when
[1:15:38] the veil was torn the centerian is moved
[1:15:42] he was moved his words are recorded in
[1:15:44] the scripture he was moved if i could
[1:15:46] say he was inspired and god caused his
[1:15:49] lips to confess the same thing that god
[1:15:52] did on the jordan river truly this man
[1:15:55] is the son of god
[1:15:58] oh and i got so much joy and pondering
[1:16:01] it it was a centurion
[1:16:03] so there's there stood at the cross a
[1:16:05] gentile
[1:16:08] a gentile who fully couldn't comprehend
[1:16:10] what was happening at the ceasing of
[1:16:12] jerusalem but yet something in that
[1:16:14] moment inspired him to say this is
[1:16:16] christ this is the son of god and we
[1:16:19] have a gentile witness that day of what
[1:16:22] happens when heaven is open when the
[1:16:25] veil is torn
[1:16:31] oh praise the lord
[1:16:34] the break-in of the veil is a symbolic
[1:16:36] opening of heaven
[1:16:39] the break-in of the veil is a loosing of
[1:16:41] the mystery
[1:16:42] to reveal christ
[1:16:44] the brother man says in the unveiling of
[1:16:46] god go listen to that go listen to the
[1:16:48] mighty god unveiled
[1:16:49] brother jared i know you were listening
[1:16:50] to it recently and going through it
[1:16:52] studying it
[1:16:53] god brother says god veiled in a human
[1:16:55] being
[1:16:57] he was in that flesh
[1:17:00] and that flesh was his veil
[1:17:03] the veil was rent
[1:17:05] the god might be made manifest
[1:17:08] there was a veil that was torn
[1:17:10] in the temple
[1:17:11] but then there was a veil that was
[1:17:12] bloodied bruised and beaten
[1:17:15] in rent on the cross
[1:17:17] that god might be made manifest
[1:17:21] the veil
[1:17:22] being opened is to manifest god
[1:17:27] that's exactly what this i want you to
[1:17:29] see in the opening of the veil when he
[1:17:30] cried with a loud voice
[1:17:31] and a veil was opened it's sick there's
[1:17:34] a literal happening there's symbolic
[1:17:36] representations but it also represents a
[1:17:37] revealing
[1:17:39] so now in the unveiling of god
[1:17:42] i want to read more if those of you have
[1:17:45] good eyes this is all i got left
[1:17:48] and this is usually about a half hour
[1:17:51] 45 minutes
[1:17:52] we'll see where we end up and the
[1:17:53] unveiling of god i want this to be a
[1:17:55] special service
[1:17:56] right brother andrew kept telling me
[1:17:58] came all the way out here just to be in
[1:17:59] service with you all and i'm like all
[1:18:00] right i better give him a good one
[1:18:02] didn't get much feedback on wednesday so
[1:18:04] i'm hoping that we can just
[1:18:05] make up for it tonight today tonight
[1:18:07] glory
[1:18:08] gonna get there so the unveiling of god
[1:18:10] paragraph 108
[1:18:12] follow him please please stay closely
[1:18:13] with me that the time is it's noon
[1:18:16] uh we'll preach long enough so all the
[1:18:18] restaurants empty out
[1:18:21] he was in behind the veil
[1:18:23] now he was behind what
[1:18:25] skin veil and he says see badger skins
[1:18:27] and i believe what he's doing then is
[1:18:28] he's he's representing what the whole
[1:18:30] thing wrap
[1:18:31] the tabernacle the whole thing from the
[1:18:33] outer walls
[1:18:35] and then behind the veil
[1:18:37] and when that veil was rent
[1:18:39] on the day of crucifixion
[1:18:41] the veil that he was wrapped in was rent
[1:18:44] on the day of crucifixion
[1:18:45] see the the two breakings of the veil
[1:18:48] the whole mercy seat
[1:18:50] came into view
[1:18:51] the whole mercy seat came into view
[1:18:55] that's what's that's what he was behind
[1:18:57] the veil now i'm skipping to paragraph
[1:18:58] 112. oh brother sister that's what the
[1:19:00] jews did when he was the veil was rent
[1:19:03] and brought god in plain view hanging on
[1:19:05] the cross
[1:19:06] but i mean
[1:19:07] two to everyone else a lot of people
[1:19:09] standing by oh let's see if elias will
[1:19:11] save him
[1:19:12] this is god this is the mercy seat god
[1:19:14] is in plain view in this image of this
[1:19:17] if i be lifted up and then here's this
[1:19:18] image on the cross that the brass
[1:19:20] serpent represented it all the
[1:19:22] sacrifices everything the veil upon most
[1:19:24] everything's there it's all signified
[1:19:26] and represented here here he hangs on
[1:19:27] the cross god is in plain view he was in
[1:19:29] plain view but they couldn't see it
[1:19:32] oh that you think behold him israel
[1:19:35] behold him
[1:19:36] your messiah your savior your redeemer
[1:19:39] your kinsmen behold him here is the
[1:19:41] mighty god
[1:19:43] before you do you see him can you know
[1:19:45] him
[1:19:47] he was in plain view but they couldn't
[1:19:48] see it could it be possible that the
[1:19:50] gentiles have done the same thing
[1:19:53] oh god when they have had church ages of
[1:19:56] the son of god you should recognize what
[1:19:58] he just did he reveals himself as the
[1:20:00] son of god through the church ages but
[1:20:01] at the end of the church ages he reveals
[1:20:03] himself again as
[1:20:04] the son of man they've had him in the
[1:20:06] church ages of the son of god but now
[1:20:09] when now the veil of denominations and
[1:20:11] things the veil of tradition that we've
[1:20:13] got since pentecost when the church
[1:20:15] traditions have been rent the things
[1:20:17] that the people said days of miracles
[1:20:19] passed and these things and god has took
[1:20:22] the veil off of it and brought it in
[1:20:24] plain view and they're ready to crucify
[1:20:27] it again just exactly like
[1:20:30] think about it it's history has repeated
[1:20:33] itself
[1:20:34] it has come back around and this is the
[1:20:36] reality of laodicea revelations 3 20
[1:20:39] behold i stand at the door and knock and
[1:20:42] now you have denominational veil
[1:20:44] traditional veils you have all these
[1:20:45] veils that availed god from the people
[1:20:48] and now a prophet is standing there
[1:20:50] crying with the loud voice and he's
[1:20:52] tearing down all the veils that'll keep
[1:20:55] the believer from christ
[1:20:58] so how and when is this veil torn how
[1:21:00] was it represented in scripture we kind
[1:21:02] of walked you through
[1:21:04] revelations
[1:21:05] uh
[1:21:07] in the revelation the image of the
[1:21:08] tabernacle so revelations 3 20. behold i
[1:21:11] stand at the door not christ is on one
[1:21:13] side of the door
[1:21:14] the church is on the other everyone else
[1:21:16] is on the other side
[1:21:18] then chapter four
[1:21:20] read this with me verses one and two
[1:21:22] after this
[1:21:24] i looked and behold a door was opened in
[1:21:27] heaven
[1:21:28] so now we see a door opening in heaven
[1:21:31] and the first voice which i heard was as
[1:21:33] it were a trumpet talking with me which
[1:21:35] said come up hither
[1:21:37] and i will show you these things which
[1:21:39] must be hereafter
[1:21:41] so revelations one it's christ in the
[1:21:42] midst of the golden candlestick so it's
[1:21:44] it within that that's in the sanctuary
[1:21:46] represent the sanctuary the lamp stands
[1:21:48] and the showbread here he has christ in
[1:21:49] the midst of him and in revelations
[1:21:51] chapter two and chapter three describe
[1:21:53] those seven golden candlesticks the
[1:21:56] complaints the compliments christ in the
[1:21:57] midst of his church the rewards but he
[1:21:59] says after this let me show you the
[1:22:01] things that must be hereafter and
[1:22:02] immediately i was in the spirit and
[1:22:04] behold a throne set in heaven and one
[1:22:06] sat on the throne
[1:22:09] church ages christ in the midst of the
[1:22:10] candlesticks the sanctuary but now he
[1:22:12] goes from the sanctuary a door is opened
[1:22:15] in heaven what does the veil represent
[1:22:16] signifies the panorama of heavens and
[1:22:18] he's called to come up higher and it's
[1:22:20] as if he's transferred now from the
[1:22:22] sanctuary into the throne room because
[1:22:24] chapter four he just describes the
[1:22:26] throne room
[1:22:28] described in the midst of the throne
[1:22:29] brother i said the same voice that was
[1:22:30] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[1:22:32] candlesticks also was the same voice he
[1:22:34] heard in heaven saying come up hither
[1:22:36] john went up yes
[1:22:38] so in chapter four a door is open in
[1:22:40] heaven
[1:22:42] it's another entrance
[1:22:44] and i'm gonna i'm gonna run out of time
[1:22:46] here
[1:22:47] and i'm just gonna have to
[1:22:49] clip my mic back on in case i start to
[1:22:51] run
[1:22:53] but think about the scene then it
[1:22:55] changes
[1:22:56] it changes from the earth to heaven
[1:22:59] you have to recognize that revelations
[1:23:00] one two and three is a there's a
[1:23:03] transition and a change
[1:23:05] in from chapters two and three
[1:23:06] explicitly
[1:23:08] from earth to heaven
[1:23:10] and it says that a door is opened in
[1:23:13] heaven there's a veil torn
[1:23:16] there's a dispensation change
[1:23:18] and i'll just use some summary language
[1:23:20] john
[1:23:22] is
[1:23:23] lifted from the church ages lifted from
[1:23:25] revelations three
[1:23:27] and what he begins to see thereafter he
[1:23:28] describes the throne room
[1:23:30] which would be like in the symbol of the
[1:23:32] the
[1:23:33] mercy seat he's the way he's describing
[1:23:35] it would have these different elements
[1:23:36] and what does he begin to see the sealed
[1:23:38] book of redemption opened
[1:23:40] and as he continues to watch what
[1:23:41] happens when it opens he sees the book
[1:23:43] come back down to earth again
[1:23:45] think about that
[1:23:47] think about what's transpiring what's
[1:23:49] taking place so brother brown says oh
[1:23:51] brother sister now unveiling god are you
[1:23:53] catching it
[1:23:54] look don't you see
[1:23:56] it's been veiled through these ages
[1:23:58] according to what god said
[1:24:00] and it will be opened in the last days
[1:24:02] those seven seals would be broke and the
[1:24:04] full thing would come into view of the
[1:24:06] people
[1:24:08] so when john is describing when john
[1:24:10] sees the symbols of the church ages and
[1:24:12] he comes to the end of the church ages
[1:24:14] and christ who had been in the midst of
[1:24:15] the golden candlesticks is no longer
[1:24:18] there and he says he's knocking at the
[1:24:20] door the very next scene is a door
[1:24:23] opened in heaven and christ is speaking
[1:24:25] from heaven now he is in the throne room
[1:24:28] now he's going to go to the father now
[1:24:31] he's going to take the sealed book from
[1:24:33] the hands of him that sat upon the
[1:24:34] throne and he's going to open the book
[1:24:36] he's going to loose the seals and so now
[1:24:39] john's view changes from earth to heaven
[1:24:42] and john is going to watch things take
[1:24:44] place there before the throne but he's
[1:24:46] going to see that book come back down to
[1:24:48] earth and he's going to have an
[1:24:50] opportunity to take it need it
[1:24:53] so once again a veil is breaking
[1:24:56] a veil is opening and in that opening it
[1:24:59] exposes the church right
[1:25:01] he's no longer in those systems god
[1:25:03] doesn't know his presence is no longer
[1:25:04] there they're sterile they can't give
[1:25:06] life uh they can only produce stillborns
[1:25:08] they can only produce after their their
[1:25:10] mothers their
[1:25:11] brother is very explicit about what god
[1:25:13] has done in this age but not only does
[1:25:15] it expose the church but it reveals
[1:25:17] christ
[1:25:19] when the veil is torn
[1:25:21] it exposes the church but it also
[1:25:23] reveals christ amen and i want to leave
[1:25:26] you with this thought i said two
[1:25:27] statements i want to read from the
[1:25:28] unveiling of god
[1:25:30] but i want to leave it with this
[1:25:32] if there's been one veil torn down there
[1:25:34] must be another veil
[1:25:36] because god's always behind a
[1:25:38] veil there must be another veil that not
[1:25:41] only hides him but reveals him
[1:25:44] another another place where the shekinah
[1:25:46] glory dwells
[1:25:48] and as we've been preaching i am an open
[1:25:50] book i want you to see your place in
[1:25:51] this
[1:25:52] and i want to use this story to close
[1:25:54] in the unveiling of god i mean it's only
[1:25:56] taken me eight minutes to get halfway
[1:25:58] through this page
[1:26:00] see how hard you're pulling
[1:26:02] and unveiling a god no you remember the
[1:26:04] story but i wanted just to read the
[1:26:05] story so you can this could build there
[1:26:07] was an auction one time
[1:26:09] and they got an old fiddle up
[1:26:11] you've heard it many times an old violin
[1:26:13] the auctioneer said what am i offer what
[1:26:15] am i offered for it
[1:26:17] i may not have done this just right
[1:26:18] according to the poem it's been many
[1:26:19] many years but it comes on my mind
[1:26:22] and they picked up
[1:26:25] the old fiddle
[1:26:27] it didn't look very much looks crummy
[1:26:29] and everything
[1:26:31] he couldn't even get a bid on it
[1:26:34] finally i think he got a bid for a
[1:26:35] dollar or something like that
[1:26:38] and there was one standing there that
[1:26:39] didn't think it ought to sell for that
[1:26:41] so he went
[1:26:42] picked it up
[1:26:44] he struck in his hands and picked up the
[1:26:46] bow and
[1:26:47] rosined it and he played a tune
[1:26:49] and when he did everyone started crying
[1:26:52] they'd never heard such music in their
[1:26:53] life
[1:26:54] then the auctioneer said what am i
[1:26:56] offered two thousand five thousand ten
[1:26:57] thousand what was it catch this
[1:27:00] the master's hand revealed what was
[1:27:02] veiled in the old instrument
[1:27:04] the master's hand revealed what was
[1:27:07] veiled in the old instrument
[1:27:10] i'll leave it up there for just a little
[1:27:12] bit longer if you want to jot it down
[1:27:13] take a picture however you want to
[1:27:14] remember this the master's hand revealed
[1:27:17] what was veiled in the old instrument
[1:27:21] did not the master reveal what was hid
[1:27:23] in the old testament
[1:27:24] take the same master's hand to reveal
[1:27:27] what's veiled in the new testament the
[1:27:28] master's hand revealed what was veiled
[1:27:31] in the old testament same now
[1:27:34] the old book gets ragged it's laughed at
[1:27:36] burnt made fun of but the time has come
[1:27:40] that they got a denominational auction
[1:27:42] the world council of churches they're
[1:27:44] sounded like nobody's business there's a
[1:27:46] denominational auction coming but
[1:27:48] remember there's something in the old
[1:27:51] book that promised that there would be
[1:27:53] predestinated ordained hand come one day
[1:27:57] that would pick it up and make the word
[1:27:58] of this book through a predestinated
[1:28:01] heart to the task that it's made for and
[1:28:04] reveal the promises that's in it
[1:28:07] oh i say in type you could just say to
[1:28:09] him oh master come and take this book
[1:28:13] come and take this book and open it up
[1:28:15] god come and take this old mocked
[1:28:19] abused and persecuted book confused
[1:28:22] whatever it may be and open this book
[1:28:25] why because all that is in the book is
[1:28:27] the believer it's you the words and the
[1:28:29] book he says there's got to come a
[1:28:32] predestinated ordained hand to take this
[1:28:35] book through a predestinated heart to
[1:28:37] the task that it's made for and reveal
[1:28:39] the promises that's in it oh it might
[1:28:41] look like a bunch of holy rollers or
[1:28:43] something other but just takes the
[1:28:45] master's hand to reveal on it to reveal
[1:28:48] that word and it becomes more than a
[1:28:50] holy roller
[1:28:52] it becomes that to the very every one of
[1:28:54] us hasn't it friends it's not a bunch of
[1:28:57] fanaticism it depends on whose hand has
[1:28:59] the bow
[1:29:01] depends on whose hand the bow is in
[1:29:04] let me say this there's something even
[1:29:06] if we wanted to use it about the books
[1:29:08] and tapes and the mp3s and the message
[1:29:10] there's something bound up in that
[1:29:11] there's something sealed in it there's
[1:29:13] something sealed in this book
[1:29:16] he says it's been mocked it's been
[1:29:17] laughed and it's been scorned it's been
[1:29:18] burnt but it holds a mystery
[1:29:20] he said the master's hand
[1:29:23] revealed what was veiled in the old
[1:29:24] instrument
[1:29:26] if you're this new testament it's the
[1:29:27] master's hand that will unveil
[1:29:30] what is veiled in this book
[1:29:33] and brother braham says
[1:29:35] and god
[1:29:36] in the unveiling of god you are the veil
[1:29:39] that veils him
[1:29:42] you are the veil
[1:29:44] that veils him
[1:29:46] i think a lot of statements that may be
[1:29:47] being read this morning is what a
[1:29:48] resurrection that was
[1:29:50] what a resurrection this is
[1:29:53] he resurrected out of dark
[1:29:54] denominationalism he's revisiting so
[1:29:56] many themes that i've loved to preach
[1:29:57] through the years on easter and they're
[1:30:00] so beautiful they're so precious they're
[1:30:01] so important i i think there's nothing
[1:30:04] wrong in revisiting regularly even if it
[1:30:06] was just every easter to remind
[1:30:08] ourselves that we're in a time of a
[1:30:10] resurrection out of dark
[1:30:11] denominationalism
[1:30:13] and what happened then has happened now
[1:30:15] spiritually for the bride
[1:30:19] my closing statement brother brown said
[1:30:20] he died to reveal himself to us
[1:30:24] now let us die to self
[1:30:26] to reveal him to others
[1:30:29] let us die to the traditions and things
[1:30:31] to reveal him to other die in the
[1:30:33] denominations to reveal him to others it
[1:30:35] is our duty this generation must reveal
[1:30:38] jesus christ and just as he died to
[1:30:41] reveal himself to us then we've got to
[1:30:43] die to our veils we've got to have veils
[1:30:45] torn down doors and doors of the heart
[1:30:47] denominational veils denominational
[1:30:48] interpretations our own personal
[1:30:50] ambitions all our desires we die let us
[1:30:52] die as he died to reveal himself to us
[1:30:56] as a veil was torn to make a way of
[1:30:58] revealing let my life which is a veil
[1:31:01] though him and let me die to all my
[1:31:03] other ideas let those veils be torn down
[1:31:06] that i can be a true veil of the
[1:31:08] shekinah glory
[1:31:11] i think one of the things that saul
[1:31:12] stirred brother brown him up in christ
[1:31:14] as a mystery as he came to this place
[1:31:16] and said just think just think christ
[1:31:18] revealed right in us now right now in us
[1:31:22] where is the shekinah glory today it is
[1:31:25] in his people
[1:31:28] so let us die to reveal him
[1:31:31] to others
[1:31:32] that'll that's what's going to make this
[1:31:34] a true easter
[1:31:36] is when they see the resurrection in you
[1:31:38] and you know what to some
[1:31:40] to some they may see nothing more than a
[1:31:42] holy roller to some that may seem
[1:31:44] nothing more than a man that is beaten
[1:31:45] and blooded upon a cross they may see
[1:31:47] nothing more than the veil
[1:31:49] but you've got to be that
[1:31:52] because it's the way to christ
[1:31:54] let's stand today
