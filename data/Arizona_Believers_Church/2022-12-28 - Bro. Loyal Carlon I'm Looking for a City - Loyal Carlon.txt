TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jehovah Jireh 1962. now Abraham was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God and today we are Pilgrim strangers looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God look Abraham before he had ever known there was something like an instinct in him that he looked at the city today passing down with the wife I was saying a lovely little place here sitting on the hill maybe 300 hundred years ago beautiful wood great High Timbers man come in they cut them down polluting the streams it would be a beautiful place to live here yeah but you look he built houses then he began to multiply sin and violence begin to come in Hollywood moved in close to him brought it in by movie by television and now it's contaminated sinful every city and surely as people some things in them likes to live together to neighbor and to be right righteous there is surely a city somewhere the Deep calling deep again and then from 64 questions and answer answers I just give anything this morning if I had a place here on Earth that I could go and say this is home if I had it I'd give a million dollars if I had a place that I could say boy I just love this so well I don't want to leave it no more I'd give anything but I can't find it I'm some something like Abraham was I'm looking for a city see I can't find it but I know it's there but I certainly can't get adjusted to any certain place on this Earth it just don't look like fine people fine places and you go here it's too wet you go out there it's too dry go up here it's too cold go down there it's too hot see there's no place it just stayed home and it's funny actually looking at this for myself I'm from Minnesota I lived in Tennessee for about two years I've lived here for about two years and I can say that this is true in Minnesota it's way too cold out in in the east coast it's way too wet it's kind of wet pretty much all the time it's always raining something like that coming in off the ocean there and out here it's definitely too hot except for tonight for some reason it's typically too hot and it's it's we're constantly oscillating and swinging through these seasons and times and shifts we go through this in the earth in the natural state of the Earth but then we also go through these things in our lives there are times and Seasons that we go through both on a on a large scale right when you're a kid you're in a springtime it's time to plant seeds it's time to grow it's time to listen it's time to be watered and you're in a spring time of your life no one really expects you to be bearing fruit when you're a kid at the end of the day your job is to learn your job is to grow but you start to get into your mid-20s maybe into your 30s into the summer of your life people expect to see some growth after a while it's the time to be where growth should have been taken taking place some branches are spreading out you're able to get some shade from this tree there's some strength in that growth and then of course we know after summer comes fall there should be some fruit in this tree there should be some fruit in this life going into 40s and 50s there should be depending on the decisions that were made when we were younger there's fruit that comes forth and then of course we know after fall comes winter and we can think of more of the retirement season where we're living off of those stores that the life has lived that's the Harvest that has been reaped from a what a life well lived but then we also see in the spiritual levels we see seasons and times that we all go through there are some times that are drier than others there are times that are wetter than others there are times where it just seems like everything is going perfect and when those times come we tend I don't know about you but for me I'm always like yes I finally made it I finally made it and then what do you know then we go back into another season dryness or wetness or whatever here we have no continuing City though we would think to know it though we would think to hold on to it even the Bible says any man that that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall why because we are are constantly we know Jesus talked about the parable of the the two houses one's built on Sand and one's built upon the rock sand a sifting sand the sand is a metaphor for man for mankind man's ideas if we're building our house our foundation of Our Lives upon man we're always going to be shifting back and forth that's always going to be this thing than that thing there's always going to be something um moving us in a sense but if we can drill down to the Rock and build our life upon the rock it the rock of God's word never moves it's always steadfast we're able to count on that and to trust in that 1953 expectancy look at the Indians when we first come here why they were worshiping Sun they were worshiping totem poles and everything there was something in them that knowed there was a maker somewhere all human beings know somewhere they've worshiped images and beasts and everything but they know there's a maker somewhere what is it they're thirsting for God there's bound to be a truth and a god somewhere to respond to that thirst not long ago when a church began to get a little different formal and cold many of you Full Gospel people you couldn't stand that you started craving and thirsting after more of God and if you're thirsting for more of God there's got to be more of God to respond to that thirst or you'd never have that thirst Something in My Redeemer Lives liveth something down in the human soul is crying out for something they can't find the Deep calling to the Deep I uh wanted to just throw in here just a little bit of a testimony and I don't I don't know I just felt led to go in this direction so y'all pray for me and bear with me about 11 years ago and it's it's around this time of year a bunch of kids are going to Winnie the treat right now it's a beautiful time of year it's a great time I went for a number of years but 11 years ago this week uh was Winnie the treat and there were um a youth camp as you do you're in your early 20s late teens you spend a lot of time together you have some great services and then typically there's an after party right everyone gets together they hang out at the time for young people to connect exchange Facebook back in the day I mean that's kind of the way it went and there were a bunch of us um that had 50 people to send out a house let's put it that way 50 people descended on this tiny little house somewhere in Michigan or Ohio I can't remember and I just remember brother Aaron actually preached at those services and it was a beautiful time like we had one of the most beautiful times of communion and I remember we all showed up at this house and we kind of broke into groups like there was a group playing games there was a group that went off on a walk there was a group downstairs playing other games and then there was a group of us that ended up in this small room almost like a closet there was a wall a false wall that you could just kind of pull over this little like 10 by 10 foot room and there was 10 of us in there and we were just kind of ended up finding each other the people that really wanted to talk about the service like really like we just we there was a there was a need to go a little bit further than just the services than just the thought just to go a little bit deeper and I remember I was fortunate enough to be in that group and I just remember we were talking about God and there there was it's so I just want to take you on a little bit of a journey tonight because I I felt to bring this it's been 11 years and it was this week and I was just thinking about this this event is where things changed for me having grown up in and around the message you know you have you go through seasons and periods I was for myself and again I don't know why I'm going down this maybe it's for the young people but baptized when I was 12 years old you know grew up my dad was a song leader I was best friends with the pastor's son you know you're very clean cut stereotypical christian-born kid you know that's that's the thing and then you know you go through your teenage crises and you think you're just the worst person ever and like all this stuff God really got a hold of my life again when I was 18. and I felt like I was in a really good place with God in a lot of ways and yet here we are I'm I think 22 whenever this came about 11 years ago yeah I guess I'm 33 there we go um you forget as you get older I guess I can say that now right anyways but we were in this this room and I just remember I'm there you know here I for me I feel like I've already got a walk with god I've already spent a lot of you know I've dedicated I was already a worship leader at my church I was already running a Bible study like for me it was I'm in a really good place as far as anyone else knows and yet somehow deep inside I remember that whole sequence of services I remember I was wrestling inside of myself with this idea of what if this is all just a joke like what if it's not even real like what if it's all I think having been someone who like I read a lot I've always been a voracious leader reader having read a lot of books having really like dug in in college and a lot of different things it it becomes very easy to compare one thing to something else it's very easy to compare the experiences that people have in one religion to another religion or that some people have in in maybe a emotional experience to another emotional experience I mean we know that this is true and in the secular Christian world it's basically a rock concert it's kind of the same thing like I I've been to my fair share of shows I know what it's like I know what that atmosphere is like and where you know you have your altar call in a rock concert absolutely it's it's there are tenants that are very similar that are very parallel and so it's very hard when you've dug deep enough to start to divide that and the doubt can set in and so for me like I believed that this was true but I had it was almost like a palpable voice someone sitting on my shoulder like you don't believe any of this none of this is all nonsense but I I was hungering for something more for for something greater because I knew that there had to be and we all have our own testimonies and I guess I just want to share this because this was something very important for me and for several of us we were in this room um Chris take was there Nathan Erickson Zachary Wallace was there uh several different people from this area were there and we just we be like I don't know how long it was I don't know how many hours it was but we were talking about God and eventually like a like it was like a concentrated force of desire and we decided we're just going to pray now there's no ministers here it's a bunch of young people in a house in our early 20s there's no music there's nothing there's nothing to work someone up we're in this little room it's not very comfortable these like really bad little wooden chairs and we all just start praying and I remember in that like you you just felt the room charge and then someone started speaking in tongues and someone started prophesying and in that moment the room blew up it was it was weird I know for myself it was like a scream came out of me that I'd never like it wasn't me it was weird and that voice left whatever it was for me left and it hasn't come back which is it thanked the Lord for that like it it left now I've gone through my season since then but I never there's a lock there it's like a wall P that that what ended up happening was someone of that they heard us screaming in there and they they pulled the false wall back and eventually just like blew up into the rest of the room people were downstairs playing games they hear us upstairs like running around and you know it just enveloped the place and I mean we started praying for people people were healed like we were it was amazing people that had gone on the walk a friend of mine Jared meat he goes to brother um Paul off maintains her she's a minister now he said he was walking around outside as a part of the group and he looks through the window they were coming back and he saw people running around in circles with their eyes closed and he thought that they were playing games and so he goes running into the house and he's like we're playing games you know and he said for him it was like when he went in the door he hit a brick wall like oh something stopped him from going in the door because it his Spirit wasn't in the same Union as the spirit that was going on in there and my sister was a part of that group as well she can testify to the same thing and so they they prayed outside and they slowly entered in and it went on for five six hours like this the police started circling the building literally there were police that were coming down and um long story short like we we something happened something happened that you can't explain that I couldn't explain and the Beautiful Thing is we all a lot of us ended up going to Paul off on teen's Church the next day which was happened to be Sunday and the same thing happened again where all of a sudden it just broke out I'm sure you're over there you remember Michael like it was a beautiful thing all of a sudden just this spilling out of the spirit and the power of almighty God and to me and to those of us that were there now not everyone not not everyone connected the dots but to me it was the first time I saw something real real having grown up around this thing where you're taught the tenets of Faith taught you know you get baptized you know seeking the Holy Ghost I know what's right and wrong I know these things but I needed something that was real because if we're looking at just the the tenets of the faith I mean really if you look at it we could all go be Buddhists and would actually be pretty good people like if you go look at it like they're not that bad we could all become like and again that's that's a broad kind of smoothing it over but if we're just if we're just coming to Christianity for a better way of living then it's vanity it's just vanity it's just another way of living and we've got to have something real today we've got to have something real for today I was just thinking about this it may have been 11 years since that event but it's just as real and alive today it's just as real and I I can say for myself I think in the years of of Trials and struggles since then as Satan has attacked me and many of us that were there I I can attest for several of them that I've talked to since and they've all said the same thing that even though like the attack of the enemy has come we can never it can never cross that line there's a memorial for each one of us back to that time where God made himself real not just a hype up not just a fanaticism not just an emotional time and my my reason for bringing it up isn't like oh yeah look at this great time that I had and now you guys need to go find a room somewhere and now you can go figure it out like that's not the point the point being is that for each one of us there's a thirst for God there is a craving and a desire for God and God put that desire in there and if God put the desire in there he owes it to us to satisfy that desire if there is a deep calling then there must be a deep to respond there must be and I think even even as we age and we grow more mature in the faith again we're going into those Seasons those seasons of summertime those seasons of harvest that we might think in our lives you know I've already been walking with God I've already had those times with God he can do just the same today continuously that ever that ever present joyous stream is alive for us today we don't have to just be living in a testimony of days gone by but we can connect to him today in the now in today first 1965 you say I have a holy thirst I'm not guilty brother Branham and of just go and joining church and things like this but see to neglect a thirst if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food you will die and if you neglect that thirst in you for God you will spiritually die you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a Revival well that ain't the Revival for you the Revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for God there might not be another member of that church wanting that Revival if it breaks out in you it will break out other places see praise the Lord it will break out in you as we're going into this next year this is the last service of this year going into another year and I was just thinking about the in some ways the futility of the perpetuity of life in a sense here comes another year we go by people make New Year's resolutions they aim like I'm going to try to get a raise this year or I'm going to lose some weight this year and there's a there's a futility to it all in some regards it as a metaphor if we clean the house we just have to clean the house again if we do the dishes we just have to do the dishes again if we eat a delicious meal we just have to eat a delicious meal again not complaining on that one but we do if we get a good night's sleep a perfect night's sleep we just have to sleep again if we take all of our vitamins if we shave whatever we just have to do it again it is this continuation of the cycle of life and the and as Ecclesiastes said it Ecclesiastes 4 verse uh four again I considered all travail and every right work every right work this isn't bad works it's every right work that for this man is envied of his neighbor this is also vanity and vexation of spirit the fool full I can't say that word today folds his hands together and eats his own flesh betters and handful with quietness than both the hands full which her veil in a vexation of spirit then I returned and I saw vanity Under the Sun there is one alone and there is not a second yea he hath neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labor neither is his eye satisfied with riches thank you neither safety for whom do I labor and bereave my soul of good this is also vanity yea it is a sore travail 59 thirsting for Life some people things to make money that's life make money plenty of it amen I'm just kidding just kidding um some people thinks that they're young gaity and running out and dances and things cutting up carrying on immoral next morning with a headache heartache broke up homes that's not life that's death disguised that's the wolf in the sheep's clothes clothing that cannot be life that's death and the world is deceived by those things but the question is my brother sister tonight what makes men and women do that if they're mentally right what makes them do that what makes them crave to drink whiskey what makes the American people smoke cigarettes is because when God made a man he created him thus he made a man to thirst and there's a little place in the heart that nothing will fill it but God Jesus said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness and it's God trying to get to a human heart the devil tries to quench that by letting them drink theirself to death or run themselves to death or something else but God created man to have that Holy thirst and if you won't take God you'll have to take something else to kind of appease that calling you'll have to take something else and I think of it today and in the Instagram social media age that we're in I just I don't know whatever I work in marketing and sales and I've just been I think about this all the time and it's terrible they say that when you work in a poison Factory you never want to drink your own product and it's kind of true if you work in marketing and sales you start to get this like wow everyone really is just like they're pushing a religion is what's actually happening we're pushing an ideal if it's not the the fitness lifestyle then it's the nutrition lifestyle if it's not the nutrition lifestyle then it's the gamer lifestyle if it's not the gamer lifestyle it's the car lifestyle that lifestyle becomes the religion becomes this ideal this Obsession the the thing that every weekend is spent thinking about and they're thirsting and again like I I think it's it's important to update this away from alcohol or denominations or drugs or you know uh going out to you know just like you know the club or whatever but updating it to the the anything again there's nothing wrong with having a nice car there's nothing wrong with working out there's nothing wrong with good nutrition or whatever but the moment that it becomes the substitute now we have a problem there is a problem and it's very often and we look at this if Satan can come with the word then certainly he can come with things that are good for us and pervert them into idolatry pervert them into taking the place of our love and our need and our desire for God I don't know about you but I've tried plenty of this like meditation like headspace mindfulness stuff sure it's great you know some of it's awesome I think it's really good but it will never take the place of a relationship with Christ it doesn't matter how much these people can say all you need is 10 minutes a day of headspace and just take some deep breaths in and ah you know you know and even the Christian version of it the Christian version is you know if you look back into the roots of the Bible the word Isha or whatever it's like that's the word of God or Yahweh is it's the Breath of God and you know when we're breathing we're saying the name of God and like that stuff is beautiful but again it's not it is if put in the right place it's fine it's just like you know going and eating a good meal we all need to do that that's that's not a problem but the moment it becomes it's a very quick thing it's a very subtle thing where it shifts to self worship the worship of yourself the same thing again going back to working out or going back to nutrition these different things it can become this idea yes our body is a temple that's a scripture just saying we all got to go sign up for the gym January 1st Let's go people come on gotta get our numbers up um our body is a temple but if we're taking that in isolation then we create yeah our body is a temple to our own lusts and again not preaching against working out although those other things it's fine but we must keep it in Balance we must keep the main thing the main thing and we must not allow the we must not allow I love it the and I don't have it right in front of me but we'll just quote it is Jesus talked about the parable of the sower and how some some was um some of the seed was thrown onto you know rough brown or bad ground or whatever you know the birds come up and pluck it out but some fell on really good ground in fact it was so good that the weeds really liked growing there too and I think too frequently that's us if we're not maintaining that ground the weeds come in and if you look at it Jesus said it was the the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches came in and choked out the seed again it was good ground it was good ground and and if we look brother Branham talks about in uh a series on demonology he talked about many this is true it's an exact quote go look it up there are people who can be filled with the Holy Ghost and be totally insane because they've allowed their Spirit man their their body to become so possessed by the things of this life and the things of this world and of course we know that there's different mental illnesses not not shaming anyone for that but that the point being is that we if we are not careful we can allow even with the Holy Ghost we've been born again we can allow our spirits to become polluted with the things of the world and there is no longer the ability to bring forth fruit God help us Ecclesiastes 5 10. he that love is silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loves abundance with increase this is also vanity I can just see you know what's funny I can see Solomon writing this and it's just like with his riches and with his wealth and he's just like man I got it all still not happy hashtag you know whatever like I mean that's that's the idea here really this is the idea this is the worst that's basically what he's saying updating it to modern language like sad face or angry face it's annoying to have labored for what you love and never being satisfied with that thing that you love I mean I'm sure we've all done it you get a new car yes this is the best two weeks later it's like picking at like something like under like you know like the seams and the leather whatever like we we start to there's it's our human nature we're going to find same thing with this building like when we moved out of the hotel it's like whoa yay oh my God it's so hot in here like it's the worst you know like immediately we're updating our need because we're humans we have no continuing City there's always going to be something that we're dissatisfied with as humans as as long as we are looking to the things of this Earth to satisfy us for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come just remember brother we are looking for a city to come whose Builder and maker is God that's right we're looking for a kingdom to come it isn't Germany it isn't Switzerland it is in the United States it's Christ and the kingdom from above praise the Lord uh from and I'm watching the time here greater than Solomon is here uh speaking of the queen of Bathsheba that didn't satisfy her she said but sir speaking of the priests there in her country sir look they tell me that it is a living God dear look look at the gods that we have here yes that's right all the books and gods but I never seen nothing move in them grandma didn't see nothing moving them and her grandma didn't see nothing moving them they're nothing but a bunch of words they're nothing but a bunch of idols but they tell me that is a living God who lives in human beings and I want to see something real bless her little heart I want to see something that's got some life to it not a dead Idol not a dead formal theology we've got to have something real we've got to and I think that I'm just going to drop this in here because I felt we've got a wonderful Church we've got great word we've got great worship we have people that love the Lord and if we stop there it's all in vain it's all in vain the the the and you see this I've seen this before in other churches that I've been in and I again I'm not saying we're getting it here but it's something we should be aware of the moment we start thinking wow man that was a great service we we're it like I got like where we got it that moment is the moment we're no longer we're not receiving from God which comes back to this idea of self-worship and if you look at this this is a continuum any time and again I love brother Aaron I love him but if we start lifting him up it's like brother Aaron you got wow whoa so amazing God will come in and he will make sure that we get our eyes back on Christ he will make sure because God isn't going to share his glory with anyone he will make sure that that happens and so it is is vital and again Pastor appreciation believe in all that it's very important it's great but we must make sure we're focusing on Christ we're looking through the ministry to Christ we must get a hold of God it's not enough to have read the Bible multiple times to memorize again there are people who will beat us at every single one of those things memorizing the word of God studying it voraciously but Jesus talked about a way that a fool would an air in it there's a scripture and I'm don't have it in my notes this is totally off the cuff the think about that that there is a way that someone who is not able to comprehend it intellectually can still get a hold of God they're not able to put all the quotes or the scriptures together and like wow I really got this deep Revelation right and yet they if they're a child of God they won't miss it they won't miss it God help us to have that level of humility to be able to lay off our intellectual crowns and say God I need you I need you because it is the very things that we think we know that may be keeping us from a closer walk with God we know so much we know so much honestly what it often creates is spiritual obesity we know so much oh so good when's the last time you exercised your faith when's the last time you were able to bring it into your life at the end of the day and again we're not even talking about it's not about the signs and the Wonders and jumping up and down and screaming though those things are awesome and I love them I love it but it is in our day today grind just down into this the weeds of life and I love it God Jesus said he would never leave us never forsake us so the days we don't feel like Christ is there those are the days that's the reason Jesus said that because he knew most days we'd probably think he's not there right but he is there not because we can feel him but because he said he would be he would be there in the middle of our muck and our mire and our our our own Frailty I love it says in Psalms David wrote you remember we're butt dust he remembers we're just dust you know we tend to think we put so much pressure on ourselves that we got to have this whole thing figured out we have to have everything just so and then you know once I'm going good for 30 days then I'm gonna be you know it takes 30 days to build a habit and then once I'm there then God will accept me then I'll be like a favored child of God look at me or if we don't think that we definitely think the opposite of that I've been doing really bad for the last 30 days I'm definitely way down here I'm just you know don't look at me God you know wait until I know friends I have friends who grew up around the around the message and around Christianity that have basically said I don't I can't I can't come to church I can't come do these things because I know I can't live it and they're right and neither can you neither can I and but yet we think we're supposed to we do I'm not the only one we think we're supposed to oh God don't worry yeah you saved me I got it from here get off like go I got it from here but that I think that the the human walk and again this idea of there is no continuing City it is too make sure we are always in a position where we need God we are always in a position where we where we can look to him and as long as we can get our eyes off of the hand of man off of Our Own ability to save ourselves is the moment that we stop trying to save ourselves that God can actually come in and do something in our lives is the moment Psalms 84 verse 2. my soul longest yay even fainteth for the courts of the Lord my heart and of My Flesh cryeth out for the Living God yea the sparrow hath found in house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars O Lord of hosts my king and my God blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will still be praising they blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness 1956 at kadish barnia talking about Moses and in the face of that burning bush that day he received an experience that stayed with him as long as he lived and as I said last night so I say today that man no matter how good Moses was taught how much theology he knowed how good a church member he was and how good a teacher mother he was brought up under and every precept of Education that could be brought he was a King's son but he's still trying in himself failed to make it go over but in five minutes in the presence of the burning bush he became a new person something happened and what we need today in our seminaries it's not so much theology to be taught but a burning bush experience where men get down before God and meet him face to face we need a challenger today like we had in that day what we need is a man and woman who has met God and know what they're talking about not somebody trying to teach from some church book or some open theology what we need today is a man that's been in the presence of a burning bush has been born again and changed and made a new creature and I was thinking about this I love this testifying think about and again secular Christianity has taught us that testifying is going out and talking to someone and saying here's the 10 steps to Salvation now if you want to come down to my church we'll get you hooked up that's testifying testifying really though if you think about the compound meaning of that word is a testimonial of an experience I was there I saw it this happened I was there and it's the the you can't testify unless you've seen something God help us have less less of this and more of this drilling down with our own lives to God we need it I need it we all need it we've got to have an experience with God it's what we need it's what our young people need it's what this church needs we need we must have and again I think we often conflate it's very easy to kind of move this into oh we need to have a time of just crying and everyone needs to be shouting or something it's like maybe but at the end of the day when something happens you'll know you will know from that time there the something happened something happened and we need it Matthew 6 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you and I love this and I believe brother Aaron has touched on this before as well the definition of the word seek and there's a couple of compound meanings but one of them if you go back to the original text the word actually means to Crave to demand something from someone to seek Him First for even the uh idea of first is of utmost importance this idea of demanding like I have got to have this I've got to have this I have must have the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto us Jeremiah 29 and yeesh verse 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart with all your heart not a partial surrender or a partial idea or again even even I think it's so easy to to have walked with God and get used to a walk with God it's like oh well this is just kind of the way life is now you know I just come to church on Sunday and come to church on Wednesday and you know I read my Bible sometimes and I pray sometimes you know like or we get into a routine we get into a habit of serving God those things are fine nothing against them but our faith is not built in our habits and our rituals and our routines our faith is not built and how well we are doing right now our faith is not is not in in our environment or the people that we are around our faith must be solely In Christ Alone must be solely aimed at Christ we can think of this in the way that we look like we we must be looking unto Christ 1957 uh the greatest gift in the Bible that's the way my soul thirsts for thee Oh I must have you Lord or I'll perish if you only knew sinner friend that the hounds of hell is right behind you crippled and wounded by sin you've got to find Christ or perish when that sort of a desire gets into a man's heart he will find Christ when you get in that shape as the heart paneth for the water Brook I must have it I'm wounded if I don't have it I'm I'm gone I'm gone and this is the place of true surrender surrendering is not a thought it's not a word it's an action it's something we do it isn't oh you know I love the song I surrender all it's not I surrender all like that's a great song we should sing it after this it's a great song but it that is a profession not an action true surrender is when God's got you in a headlock and there is no choice but to tap out life's got you you don't got it you don't have it and it is in that moment we must call upon the Lord and let go and that's where trust comes in and I'm watching the time we're coming to a close shortly trust is faith in action we sit on chairs tonight because we believe that it will hold us most of us I'm just kidding they'll trust we trust that the chair will hold us and a lot of the times the reason we don't surrender to Christ is because we don't really trust him we say we do we might even want to but we don't the Bible says to come boldly before the throne of grace that you might obtain mercy and I love brother Aaron brought it out the other day that the word boldly really means honestly come honestly before the throne of grace that you might obtain Mercy that God I don't have it you know I think sometimes it's almost harder when you believe yourself to be a Christian it's almost harder to get down and tell God I don't have this I don't have I don't have enough faith for this I don't know if I do but being honest with God about where we are because again the faith if we lack Faith Bible said if the if you lack Wisdom ask God everything we need comes from God we don't need to we put on our masks with each other as humans we put on masks we put on personas like hey I'm a great person and inside we know that that's not that's just nonsense even when we are doing great some part of us somewhere is like man I don't know if I am doing great some part of us and we can bring that before God without the fear of judgment without the fear of rejection without the fear of criticism without without the father looking down and saying yeah you are messed up um the story of the prodigal son is so beautiful it's so beautiful here's the prodigal son he's the son he's been given wealth riches goes and squatters it goes and does just the you know he's doing cocaine like I mean he's just he's not a good guy he is not a great son and yet here he is coming back ready he's totally abased he's ready to just be a servant and yet he's not even able to get it out of his mouth before the father says we're throwing a party I'm so glad you're back I'm so glad to see you we're gonna have some barbecue and some steaks and some brisket I mean that's what it is we're throwing a party and that is the same love that Christ has for us as Sons even as people who know better coming into a close uh musicians can go ahead and come you say if you would have lived in the days of Jesus I would have done so and so why you are living in his days you are if you're looking for him you'll find him he's here there's a fountain open tonight brother when a man hunger and thirst for God there's bound to be something in there to create that thirst foreign and I guess as we come to the close of this year and I I guess I would extend this out to all of us if you're thirsting for God there's a fountain open tonight sometimes I think um let's just play he is here [Music] as Christians sometimes we we get tired of asking we get tired of praying for the same things over and over and over again and we get warned in the battle and the struggles of life and just exhausted [Music] there's a there's a fountain for that they that weighed upon the Lord they'll renew their strength they'll Mount up with wings as Eagles maybe we've come to the point where we're bored complacent we like to say complacent but it's actually bored we're bored with our walk and our relationship with Christ and we don't want to admit that we don't want to admit that but we can we can talk to God about that he understands he understands he remembers that we're just Dust We 1954 Divine Healing I can imagine being an old man coming down whenever my work's finished and the cold ways that Jordan hit me in the face and I know I got to cross over I just want to look back down the path where I came see a lot of tracks through the Briar patches and over the rough places I don't desire a flower bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas let's have the rough way too I must fight if I must Reign I must get some of the rough Parts I want to take off the helmet of salvation lay it on the bank stick the old sword of the word hear back in the sheath of Eternity and scream to the top of my voice father push out a Lifeboat I'm coming over home this morning I believe he will be there to meet me that's right that's my faith that's built on nothing less than Jesus blood and right righteousness and all around my soul gives way he's all my trust and stay for on Christ the solid rock we stand amen let's just go to Lord in prayer tonight dear father Lord we just
