TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 13 verse 8 and again continuing on the subject of supreme faith revealed in abraham when you're sick of the subject just let me know genesis chapter 13 verse 8 and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my heard men and thy heard men for we be brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomore even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom but the men of sodom are wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly amen you can be seated and come back to that uh scripture tonight and maybe walk through it just again with the um providing some comment on it but we've been looking at um supreme faith revealed in abraham and how his life um is a pattern for us and his journey tells a testimony tells our testimony it's his testimony but also carries our testimony on sunday and i'm just going to make a few statements that kind of connect sunday's service to tonight's service we're looking at how the mystery of abraham's faith is hidden in genesis chapter one through four in the story of adam and the circumstances that adam was placed in even the circumstances of his fall god's response to the fall even events immediately after the fall in genesis chapter four him being thrust out of the garden that abraham's journey and his faith is connected to these events that transpire in those first few chapters and we could say that abraham's journey is related to abraham excuse me adam's fall and so some of the things we're looking at how the abraham's promises the promises that are given to abraham were typed in adam there were certain things that adam had and certain things expressed in adam that we see revived and manifested in abraham a statement we ended on is an identified masterpiece of god brother bram says after man had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy and come in and marred him and set death in him still was god not willing this be defeated he came down and started all over again and i love this statement he was going to make that man again so i'm not adam what adam represented what was embodied in him kind of the potential the promise the power um the the plan of god that was represented in adam he says he's going to do that over again and and i love it he's not willing he came down so we're looking at when when was this moment that god came down when is this moment that god's gonna bring this man back up again he put adam on a covenant do this and not this this and not that touched not handle not taste not but we find out when he started again he started with abraham and in abraham he started him on an unconditional covenant the subject of an unconditional covenant is so vast it is so marvelous and so wonderful that there there is kind of a pull or a draw to begin to highlight just the the number of things that are related to the fact that the covenant is unconditional and maybe we touched on a little bit on uh through the few of these services on the permanence of the promise to abraham and how that gave him this conviction that what he was seeking was eternal and had that revelation dawned on him early on then he would have never feared death because he's like this is a permanent promise god is able to revive or to raise up but i'm wanting just to look at on this very simple aspect of how that when god was starting again he started in abraham so in abraham there's this pattern that we see we're emphasizing that those words of pattern are processed and then we could say that abraham there's this profile of abraham's life so in abraham we see this profile and i want to be very specific tonight to an element that we were bringing out on sunday and just be very specific again and identify a particular aspect that again it opens up in a whole other area too that i'm going to be somewhat restrained in but we find out when he started again he started with abraham so in abraham is when god came down and was going to begin to make that man again now we realize that abraham is not that man but there's something that is attached to abraham that abraham is carrying that he becomes a part of by covenant that cannot be defeated and in the church age book brother branham said in the garden of eden when he promised the seed to the woman he says he later designated that seed had to come through abraham so genesis 3 15 that the seed of the woman would crush the serpent that is a prophecy of jesus christ we could say that is the man that is the seed of the woman that is the man being built again the last adam and brother branham is saying that in the garden of eden when this promise was given then that seed is designated to abraham so now abraham becomes the carrier or the one that is bearing this promise of genesis 3 15. so when we can look at this way when god calls abram in genesis chapter 12 or if you want to use chapter 11 he's designating the prophecy of christ and he's placing the prophecy of christ in genesis 3 15 to abraham the seed of the woman is now designated to or assigned to abraham such a beautiful a beautiful truth to recognize how that now adam is connected the promise given to adam and the woman or the curse to the serpent is now designated or connected to abraham and then we were looking in genesis chapter 17 how that god speaks to abraham and says walk before me and be thou perfect and how beautiful it was that this uh this utterance to abraham follows his uh his having a child by hagar so here is the the suggestion of the woman you know sarah said hey why don't you have a child by my handmaid just as eve suggested to adam that they partake of this fruit and then abraham acts according to his wife's suggestion whereas in eve did the same thing to adam and he fell he lost the covenant here in the shadows of abraham listening to his wife god appears again and he doesn't take away the covenant from him but he reaffirms it says walk before me and be thou perfect and he begins to use the language that this is an everlasting covenant as for me my covenant is with thee and it's going to be everlasting and we saw how that the language that god uses to abraham in chapter 17 is god establishing an everlasting covenant that corresponds to the covenant in eden so promise that was given in eden the promise that was given that related to the to be fruitful and multiply a promise that related to a land in children in that land or possession in that land god's using the same language with abraham all right can i get an amen that's my that's my summary on sunday now i want to take a step further in this and look at specifically just a very a very narrow thought that we already touched on already but i want to add maybe some more meat to the outline but god calling abraham and then sarah with him expresses a very specific image we've already looked at this so it's not uh there's not a big wow tonight um not that there normally is but just there's not something that oh never saw that before that's just going to be very very simple and so them being called out on a journey abraham and his wife to a land that he would show them afterwards so there's it's connected with the land there's a specific image that's being represented and in the sermon marriage and divorce brotherhood said one interruption spoils the entire program now when human beings were run in continuity with god with one man and one woman that's the program of god the program of god and human beings running in continuity with it so that's kind of the image i want you to be refreshed in is that god's program once it kind of reached this spot where now it's ready now it's all seeds are going to come forth after they're kind and god's plan is going to unfold it's humanity running in continuity with god according to the program of god one man and one woman that's the image when god's program had come to this apex as it were and was then going to usher forth certain promises and certain manifestations but then he says this woman sinned and it threw the whole earthly program out of continuity with god now this is god's program one man one woman was with so much potential so much possibility but through the woman's sin the whole earthly program falls out of continuity in harmony with god's program so if we see this image the program of god or the plan of god was held within and the promise of it the potential of it was held within one man and one woman but then when they fall this program is lost whatever promise or possibility was related to this plan of god it's forfeited and we can look at it as the book goes back into the hands of god the promise of genesis 1 28 goes back to god and all these things that they were had the power and possibility of they lose we even realize they lose the land the garden is lost to them they're driven out of it and and they're guarded from it and so this is the image that god raises back up that's just the part i'm wanting to kind of highlight again is that this image of one man and one woman is the image that god begins to raise back up in the life of abraham you look at genesis chapter 11 genesis chapter 12 you'll see that the scripture begins to zero in on and focus in on one man and his wife we see the genealogies and the lineages of each of the sons of noah then we begin to see a little bit more of an amplification of some of the details of the story of the tower of babel and how important that is to the context of abraham's story but it's wanting you to get to not just this general these are the sons of or this one begat this one this one begat this one they're wanting to get to one man abram and the wife that he chose and of all the characteristics that they want to tell you about abraham and his wife the one characteristic they want you to know is that oh by the way she can't have kids right that's the one thing that is being expressed is it's one man and his wife but it highlights the inability of her to have children but god when he speaks and he speaks to him and i'm going to look at i'm just going to actually refer to verse 2 of chapter 12 he says i will make of thee a great nation and this is a language now being spoken to abram he's we're informed ahead of time that sarah is unable to have a child but he's saying i'm going to make of the great nation so this is the promise of children i whether though you have not conceived yet you do not have a son you do not have children there will be progeny of your of your own through your family through your household and so this is a promise to abraham that he will have children so though it is one man and one woman there is a promise that he's going to have children and again we see this image embodied in adam and the woman because there was this promise even the woman when she's ushered out of the garden of eden she's pregnant and so then we could see that adam abraham and sarah though she has not conceived their lives are pregnant with the promise that there will be progeny there will be children that come forth and so there's going to be it's speaking of a restoration and this is a statement that we've used a few times already but i want to just pull a very short these short words out in israel in the church and all that land among all those people one man found favor with god of all humanity over the face of the whole earth one man found faith favor with god and it wasn't because abraham folded his hands a certain way when he prayed it wasn't because he was too lazy to worship the moon god it was nothing about him that was special there was nothing that stood him apart allowed him to kind of stand in contrast to everyone it was just god calling him he says among all of humanity one man found favor with god that's what made him different is he found favor with god he said i want you to notice that is the beginning of christianity of the church so in the beginning of christianity it's god singling out one man and him and his wife and one thing just to to ponder in this image as a and i want to be able to just maybe reference it and you could allow allow it just to be amplified in your hearts that when god calls abram in calling abram and and his wife it's pointing back to adam and so we see that god is going to designate something to to abram and i want you to see how it's connected to prior to the fall in the curse at the time of the fall so that we're god is wanting us to bring the creation and the fall of creation and carry it through the flood of the depravity of man and the flood and the judgment and then even the character of man after the flood that's represented in chapter 11 and he's wanting to see that in adam it points back and abram it points back to adam and there's this there's this connection between the two of them and so abraham is pointing back to adam but it's not he's not just pointing back to adam but in abram it's pointing forward to christ so this this becomes this tremendous turn in this story and a tremendous uh focusing in on the plan of god because we could say without any any uh any uh suspicion at all or any doubt that this is where the story zeroes in on and focuses on because we only read about we've said it many many times the rest of the bible is about one man and his seed so the old testament is about that's what the rest of the bible is about whether it be his natural seed or the royal seed or the seed which is christ you could say every scripture jesus christ is in every scripture he's the seed of abraham so the entire bible is about the seed of abraham so in calling one man abraham it points back to adam but it's also pointing forward to christ and in doing so abraham is forming a link between fallen humanity and the restoration of god's plan he's just this this fulcrum this critical juncture this point where mankind has fallen but now in abraham it's going to be that which redeems fallen humanity because it's linking us to the restoration of god's program through jesus christ and in genesis chapter 12 verse 1 god calls for abraham dramatic pause to separate from his father's house he's calling him to leave his father's house and specifically get away from my father's house that means extended family mom dad cousins brothers uncles sisters uh nephews and everything it's get away from my father's house and from that kindred so it kind of expanded a little bit that if there was any question that you should separate from those in the family tree god says from thy kindred so kind of expands the scope from which god wants him to separate and from the country and we've already taken a lot of time identifying what a beautiful truth is contained in calling abraham out of babylon and then it's also from his kindred but then also from his father's house and so by god doing this in in calling abraham he will cause abraham's life to portray the image of adam and the woman he's going to and i believe that god is intentional when he does something and so it's not that god calls abraham to do something and then afterwards god goes oh well look at that how awesome was that i didn't even notice that i didn't even realize that he was in ur just on the other side of the euphrates and then later on i was going to give him a possession all the way up to the euphrates so like when i called him he wasn't even in the land of possession but then after i called it well you know it's just i didn't know what i was doing but in that awesome listen we can preach sermons that happened that way and afterwards someone says did you notice this you notice that you're like well yeah of course i did i never thought of that before that's amazing did i say that i didn't mean to say that and you connect things after the fact god is very intentional and god is doing this and he's going to cause abraham's life to portray the image of adam and the woman now we've recognized certain similarities but maybe more so we've recognized contrast that there's certain things that model after one another but there's another side of it that abraham begins to testify of so let's look at this image in genesis chapter 12 verse 4 and says so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him so god told him to get away from your father's house from your kids or from your country well he got out of ur to haran but who was in her end his dad and some of the family then he tells him to leave and this is where he's getting up out of her on and he's departing as the lord had spoken to him and god wants us to know and lot went with him we want us to know that he wants us to recognize that lot isn't with them because this is an important aspect of the process that's taking place in abraham's life and so when lot leaves with his wife and i believe in verse 5 it says he took abraham took his wife sarah and lot with them it repeats it again we realized lot following him the image hasn't quite manifested yet he still hasn't fully walked in the original command genesis 12 1 abraham ghetto and this is me summarizing get away from your father's house from your kindred and from your country and he got away from the country maybe a little bit of the kindred but he still still has his father's house hanging around and so he hasn't fully complied with or walked into the image that god had if there was a picture painted by genesis 12 1 abraham hasn't yet fully walked into that yet and so in genesis chapter 13 verse 1 abram has gone down into egypt he's lied a little bit about his wife and there's there's a certain aspect that maybe he's not told in that story because it's focusing again on abram and his wife and the the situation with pharaoh but now in verse 1 he's going to leave back out of egypt and abram went out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with them into the south so guess who was there the whole time lot yeah he refers to him in one place as his brother and so this would be kind of the though he was be considered a nephew and he would be considered an uncle there was this expectation that you would look after this one as if he was the bro your brother because he's your brother's son and in certain cultures uh you would get in trouble if uh i know this is true uh in africa in certain cultures that if you called who is one who is literally your cousin if you call them your cousin you get in trouble that's your brother and so this is lot kind of like a brother that won't leave and here he is lot with him and kind of hanging out and here he goes he goes down into egypt he's there for a while lot was with him because as he begins to come out lot is still with him when he leaves now i want to kind of drop this in here because there's a few things i want to say about lot tonight kind of just uh wetting your whistle a little bit for a more detailed look into um uh the the life of lot or how lot relates to the life of abraham maybe we could say as supreme faith is revealed in abraham we could say that maybe bad faith is revealed in law but it's um a lot i i i need to find just the right way to express this because i want it to hold some weight that it could just stay with you a little bit without amplifying it very much but lot is a more subtle representation of babylon because god speaks to abram and we we have to understand that when god spoke to abraham he began he this is he's a different man he's changed whenever god appears to you and speaks to you god appeared to abram abram is being is a changed man and he's ever changing as god calls him out so the promise was to abraham god reveals himself to abraham but lot is kind of moving along with them but lot has not changed and lot not being changed he's a chaldean he's a babylonian he's an ear right or whatever you would call him from the city of earth here he is he's followed along with uh um with abraham but in though he's left babylon we look at him and i view him as kind of a more undercover unsuspecting representation of babylon so abraham leaves er he goes into iran he's there for a while and then as he leaves and he goes south he's to go into canaan and then into cain canaan he comes but babylon is following along with them and you'll find that this is just kind of where i want to sow the seeds for you to ponder this a little bit you'll find that the message of the hour associates lot with the unwise virgin and associates him with the foolish virgin and how he is a representation of the lukewarm church so there's it's not fully come out coming out of it's not fully separating himself and this is what lot represents so there's something very significant that god wants to portray in the life of lot as it relates to abraham's calling and so when god's separating when he says i want to separate you you need to be separate he's portraying something in the separation of abraham and sarah even from lot so you say well he got out of her and he got a haran he got away from his dad but now lot's still hanging around and god needs him to separate from lot and in doing so he's expressing something he's portraying something in that separation even from this nephew even from this brother and you'll find that brother branham refers to it quite often how that abraham had to get into a condition and there's a condition that he's wanting to put abraham in in part of that condition required distance from lot and and i'll say it here and i and and i've been working just as as i've been studying this putting certain scriptures and statements of the message hour and two a little database so those of you who like data i'm compiling data on on this particular thought because i realize that such a there's just this it's very easy for people to get nasty with this right you know how can light have fellowship with darkness and essentially what they're telling you is they think their light and your darkness right how can two walk together except they be agreed it's like i don't even like to walk so let's not worry about worry about walking and there's always this nastiness associated with it right and so the same thing with lot abraham being separated from lot that it's kind of like oh well that's just lot's group and he was just a penny and i'm a silver dollar and you begin to it comes this razor's edge where all of a sudden it kind of reveals nastiness in our heart when we can be so critical and so harsh and so knee-jerky about other people when the example i'm about to start to preach my data when the example that god portrays and brother man is very precise about this and it bears repeating so i don't mind sharing it with you now the example that's portrayed now that once god separates abraham from lot watch the christian attitude in abraham to go out and pursue his backslidden lukewarm believe in brother lot so we don't become these caustic critical harsh you know hand in the face get away from me i appreciate this six foot of separation from you um attitude towards law there's still a desire to see him restore it's still an act of restoration and a pursuing that takes place but you can never come to that until the separation comes first because as long as they were together he couldn't call a lot out to a promise they were kind of in it together and so god is wanting to portray something you've been looking at a number of statements in the sermon perfect faith and as i there was a few other statements that i i put into my notes um to share with you tonight and i've realized well this is just getting getting way too long i'd hate to preach after midnight so i cut it short so that we would we wouldn't go past midnight but there's several more statements you could look at in the message perfect faith and notice this he says abraham had to believe just what that voice told him and when he was a hundred years old 25 years later i loved this statement he was stronger believe in it than he was 25 years ago when it was given to him notice the faith of abraham on day one it wasn't to attend and then on day 1000 or whatever it's to attend it grew whatever whatever faith began in abraham it was stronger 25 years later he said he believed it he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god knowing that he was able to perform what he had promised so he was stronger believe in it 25 years later than when he received it that's the process of growth maturing faith to perfect faith faith or supreme faith he said that's the way everyone must be that way you and i must be that way you must come with an unfailing faith believing that god made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that faith so we look at abraham and his testimony that he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief and he was stronger 25 years later than when it was given to him stronger believing it more robust more powerful even in the absence of it manifesting i mean wouldn't we think that if i if if we well we don't have to think if someone made a promise to hey i'm going to do this and 25 years later you'd probably say so where's your confidence that i'm going to do this where is it at you might be like where was it the day i promised it well i don't know maybe i thought you know chance 8 out of 10 that you'd do it well where is it at now like is there negative on this scale you know how low can i go on this why because by 25 years later your confidence that someone's going to do it is going to wane but yet the opposite happens with abraham he's promised something and though nothing has been done to to make it material to him and nothing has even changed significantly to where he could put his finger on it and say here it is this is the promise i have a i have a pregnancy test it says she's expecting anything like that his faith is stronger than when he first began to believe now i'm not just wanting to brag on abraham i want you says every one of us must be that way but catch this abraham had a faith that grew and was stronger as a result of the position that he was in in the process that god was putting him through the paces that he was going through because he says you have to have that we have an unfailing faith but you have to be in a position to have that faith if i could put it this way i that we have a faith and this is faith that we all begin in we're justified by faith the the new birth is the seal of that genuine faith but then this faith is growing the potential and possibility of it being perfect faith is being developed within us as we walk in god's word and feed on the word of god and we are coming to this unfailing faith a perfect faith and for that to happen you have to be in a position to have that faith so we're coming to the supreme faith it's a faith that we haven't had before and notice you have to be in a position to have that faith so there's something about the positioning that is important for that seed of faith to develop anyone who who sow seed in a garden or has plants you realize that there's certain conditions that exist in a certain position there's some plants that need sunlight there's others that don't need a lot there's some that do well in some climates some that do well in others it's this principle now that the seed that was given to abraham was positionally placed in order to grow to supreme faith and our unfailing faith has to be in a position to develop correctly so process in abraham's life was a matter of god placing him in a position what's taking place is god getting abraham in a condition to receive the promise and and part of that was separation i got to get abraham in a frame of mind i got to get him in a condition i got to get him in a place i i need i need abraham to be worked on by certain factors and i've been pondering this and will identify here in a moment that god allows different instances of conflict in abraham's life and allows them to be addressed immediately so to speak in his life conflict comes up and god addresses it so that in abraham's life this is a very good principle for us to realize that in abraham's life conflict created certain circumstances for for something a character to be addressed and in addressing it it gave him victory and it put him in a a better condition to receive the promise but when the conflict came up if conflict is delayed addressing conflict is delayed and he didn't address the conflict in the time addressing conflict or delaying to address conflict makes conflict multiplied conflict's just going to multiply multiply here would be multiplying multiplying in abraham's heart keeping bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger bigger and it would have just exploded in his life and some of us are in the pattern of delayed addressing delayed addressing where conflict is multiplying and and in abraham these things came up so that he could address him so he could have this character development to be in a condition to receive the promise it's a conditioning to manifest supreme faith and and anybody who is maybe in an off-season program you start hearing conditioning you might wince a little bit and uh and say that god's god's physical training his physical conditioning or spiritual conditioning uh is to develop faith muscles and a faith endurance and so this condition in abraham's life is to bring forth this faith and part of it is separation because this is again part of that singular theme i want to have tonight is if abraham was joined with lot then god could not further manifest the promise there were some things he could do wasn't had he it wasn't that he woke up in ur one day and um he had blocked all his family on whatsapp and stopped unfriending them on facebook and like we can't get a hold of him what happened to him he changed his number and he just abraham just ghosted his family one day and er but it was a process where he's kind of he's coming out and so certain things are being unfolded he comes into canaan and he's going through continuing south in canaan but yet there's a there's a certain aspect of the promise a certain manifestation of the promise that would never manifest until he had separated because it's part of the condition that abraham had to be in and in christ is the mystery god revealed there was a few statements from this sermon that fit very well with this subject tonight brother brown's talking he's at the end of the sermon he's just worshiping they're singing he's praised and he says it's a revelation it's eternal as god's word is eternal look the threefold purpose of god's great mystery is revealed beautiful god manifested in christ christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the lost eve back to the original condition in the garden of eden i wanted to amplify this more on sunday this garden of eden aspect that was adam was placed in that abraham sought and his promise related to but here we can see that god in the end time is giving us a revelation in order to redeem us back to an original condition a condition that was represented in a promised land a perfect land of the garden of eden with one man and his wife with the promise to bring forth children and that's what we're being restored back to and that's patterned in abraham's journey it's reflected in abraham's life this and and i say this uh i guess this is the this is part of the point i'm trying to make if i haven't i've been clear on this that's why god is doing this separation is he wants to bring that image back up again one man and a woman were driven out of eden having lost the covenant then abraham comes on the scene without any power to bring forth children without any possibility to do it without any promised land without any possession any land and god is going to bring that image back up in abram so this is this is why we see these verses unfolding if you could take a look at our text now and walk through this in genesis chapter 13 verses 8 to 13 it says and abram said unto lot and we could have taken time just to look at how that they had been journeying and and they had different flocks and herds and they had become uh so great their substance was so great and they're dwelling together it was causing conflict and abraham says to lot there let there be no strife i pray thee so here's this conflict here's the striving between me and thee and between thy herb men and thy heard here's the wisdom of abraham for we be brethren he noticed conflict he was willing to address it because had he not it would have been conflict multiplied but much worse later much harder later to bring a separation or bring a balance he says is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me here's abram now asking for separation asking that they they withdraw he says if thou take the left hand then i'll go to the right if thou depart to the right then i will go to the left he's saying wherever you go i'll go the opposite we will separate you will have your own land i will have my own land now this is something notice what comes up within lot how he chooses abraham giving him first choice he says and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plane of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah and notice the writer how he uses this language this is very unique in using this even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt is thou comest unto zoar now think of the the parrot or the uh uh the irony in this that we would say that eight this is what abram's been promised canaan and he's promised something beautiful and something great and that his promise we've kind of looked beyond this to see that abraham is looking for a city uh not made with hands who's builder and maker is god so he's looking for this dwelling place he's looking for this tabernacle and you begin to look at how verdant this city is and the new heavens and new earth and how how much of a how it stands in comparison to the garden of eden and now abraham's saying lot you choose you go this way i'll go that way whatever you choose and lot's going to choose a place that is described even as the garden of the lord and then like the land of egypt as they come out of zoar there's this beautiful representation of this very uh fertile and gorgeous and beautiful landscape and and a great place to have cattle and a great place to have resources and that's what lot is choosing but notice how it's associated with sodom and egypt maybe at the time sodom wouldn't have had such a nasty representation but we know that it's there's something contained in those cities that signifies god's judgment and wickedness it says then lot chose him all the plane of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom here he's in the nice nice region the nice land that but the bible wants us to recognize this the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly so there was more emphasis on maybe the resources and opportunities that the land represented as opposed to the righteousness of the land and this is this kind of harkens back to what was in my heart a moment ago and talking about how separation we could use separation kind of as a nasty tool to alienate ourselves and to draw division and to tear people down but abraham's separation is very precise it has uh it has a very specific purpose so when god is asking to separate it's not just kind of this arbitrary thing oh just get away from everybody i just want you to be by yourself i i i want to have you to my uh all to my own uh we do believe that god is a jealous god but this wasn't narcissism and this wasn't well i want to manipulate and control you so what i have to do is separate you and alienate you from all those people who love you and care about you this is not legalism this wasn't narcissism there wasn't anything nasty about it it's not arbitrary but god is being very precise because he has a specific purpose and i want this simple thought to kind of uh be expressed to you that god was wanting to focus the picture on one man abram and his wife sarah like there couldn't be anybody else in the picture he wanted it to be one man and his wife with the promise so that it would have the image he's kind of resurrected the image of adam and his then the woman in the garden and to think that geographically that most likely he's in the region he's very near the place that adam would have been driven out we know that he's very near the place where adam and the woman were buried and here he is in that region he's in that land and god saying hey you i am beginning in you to build that man again the second adam so i want to get you up to a spot where you and your wife are an opposite mirror image of adam and the woman being driven out of the garden defeated with the covenant stripped away from him you may look defeated abraham and you may look like you don't have children you may look like you'll never have a land but you're pregnant your life is sown with the seed of genesis 3 15. you will have this land you will have children after you and he wants that picture to be raised and that is one of the reasons why god causes the separation so it wouldn't just be abram and his all his buddies and his family and everything in this great nation going forth but it's been whittled down to the image that there was in the fall in the resurrection and the restoration of it it comes back adam and a woman abraham and the woman sarah so that's that's the emphasis i wanted to give but god not it's not just being this narrow part there's more to it why god wanted the separation because again lot is associated with babylon and look at the trajectory of lot's life he leaves with abraham and he travels with them to her on and he stays with them all the way down through the south they travel all the way down into egypt because of a famine lot's there because when it comes time to go back out into the south of canaan lot's right there with them we get to chapter uh later in chapter 13 abraham's finally hey we need to separate but think about lot's testimony he's associated with babylon he leaves babylon yes way to go lot he leaves babylon but ends up in sodom i want you to think about this type of lot i want you to think about what's represented in him and what what he signifies and what he signifies in himself and what kind of condition it is for to be in the condition of lot and what that would signify but then also how it contrasts with the life of abraham because here's a lot leaves babylon seems like he crosses over seems like he's in the right spot but he ends up in sodom that's what that's why lot that's why abraham has to be further separated then i want you to just look at this aspect or ponder this aspect that lot is also a possible distraction from the promise as a potential heir of abraham because he he's referring to him as a brother he's he's part of the household he's part of his family and so lot lot being there could always be this temptation to abram well maybe it's lot maybe he's the heir because remember the tension in the story of abraham wasn't so much that abraham would he have an heir because that was promised but who was it going to be is it going to be eliezer's household is it going to be hagar's son is it could it be lot he's part of my family who's it going to be that was the tension and one of those tensions in abraham's story and so now lot exists as an influence upon abraham's faith or i could say maybe a distraction from what god was calling abraham to fulfill and his character his decisions and how and what he stood for it stood as a contrast as a contrasting image to abraham to potentially influence abram away from perfect faith because you'll find that brother branham begins to dramatize lot he says he begin to kind of murmur a little bit maybe begin to complain and murmur and criticize and so lot represents and signifies this confusion about the promise these things i'm drawing these things right from what we're taught in the message of the hour lot signifies a mixing of the of the spiritual promise to abraham in the carnal mind to think that i could be seed of abraham i could be in the house of abraham i can be following abraham i can be so near the prophet abraham but yet i'm going to pitch my tent towards sodom and i'm going to i'm going to mix myself up with sodom and what we're seeing here is this temptation that exists so near the message of the hour to be right near these things but yet be a mixing of the promise and a mixing of the carnal and this is so this is how lot signifies confusion about the promise this influence this wrong improper image to where he could have stood as someone said well maybe this is the promise maybe this is right and maybe this is the direction god wants to go and god wants to separate abram from that so there's no confusion who the royal seat are let me say i want to say this in the life of abraham you can identify a lot of the false moves that exist today in the message you know the ones that uh there's certain things that they believe and they hold to and they're and they're uh and they're looking forward to it's just islam in the message certain things that that uh that there's a a pentecostalism and when i say that i'm referring to affair to walk further in the word of god and further to walk further in the unfolding of the word of god be enamored with the gifts you'll find that in bethel in the house of laban they were happy with the gifts but god had to call rebecca out further they had to take rachel and leah further there's certain things you can see these things reap in the life of abraham that are repeated in the time that we're living in now and so there's this representation that lot that lot has that god is wanting to separate him from think of it this way how that lot being the nephew of abraham so he's the son of abraham's brother so there was this lot as a nephew symbolizes the old nature of abraham or he's tied to it he's connected to it that in lot you see his old nature you see i am i'm a grandson of terror i am i am the son of uh of my father this is this is who i am i'm part of this family part of this bloodline this is our identity this is where we're from in lot in many ways would be a constant reminder to abraham what his old nature was what his old traditions were what his old nurture was i mean a lot would have been a reminder of what he was when he was in earth because lots never change but abraham is and it's always kind of hovering around and haunting them and always kind of there with them so god is saying look i want to separate you completely from your past i want to separate you completely from your old nature i want to separate you completely from that mindset and that attitude and that belief so lot represented this old nature and it stood in contrast to the election in grace that was evident in abram's life beautiful picture so in verse 14 genesis chapter 13 verses 14 to 18 it says and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him the bible's being very precise it's mentions this not merely that we would understand chronologically the point at which god began to speak to abram whether it could be confused here he could have said it before because that happens you know we see abraham moving out of ur and it says because the lord god half said to abram get the out so there's a little bit of a um some details that are given and then some background well this is what had happened and even in the story of rebecca running to isaac it says that she jumped off her camel and went running to meet isaac and says for her servant had said she had asked the servant beforehand who is this that comes out to meet me it is thy master and that's why she jumped off and ran but the bible wants you to understand not just for the sake of chronology but for the sake of why god began to speak to him it was because he had separated from lot lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from you could say this way and the lord said unto abram because he had separated from lot lift up now thine eyes now that lord is out of the picture now lift up thine eyes now i'm going to give you a greater vision i'm going to give you a greater revelation and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered this happens after separation says arise walk through the land and the length of it and the breadth of it walk all right now you're free now you're untethered now start making footsteps to it now start possessing the promise it can't be it's not this group move you can't have this uh make believer this lukewarm member he can't be in this in other words if i can say this way there can't be confusion on who owns the land there can't be confusion on who possesses the promise as long as you let this person in the picture to seem to be an heir and to be just like you in every way then you're never gonna possess the promise so he gets locked completely out of the picture so that the so that abram signifies and represents something to you as the royal seed you say you're different but oh what a difference no matter how similar lot may be no matter how close they may be no matter how holy they might seem to be no matter how much the promise seems to be to them the fact that the bride is different from the church is oh what a difference and as long as satan could kind of confuse the distinction be like oh well i mean i guess they're just like us except for i don't know i mean they're we're different they're different no you're vastly different completely different i think the devil would really like to try to cause confusion on who each one is so god takes a lot and he pushes them way off to the side gets them out of the picture says now look around now start walking so that you know this promise is yours it's to you and your seed after you not just your father's house not your kindred not people closely associated with it but this is to you arise walk through the land the length of it in the breath of it i will give it to thee and here's the story after lot has settled himself down view with the view of sodom before him it says then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plane of memory which is in hebron which if i which it's in this place the burial place the traditional barrier place of adam and the woman the plane of memory which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord bill abraham said until he did that the lord stayed away from abraham direct statement until he did that the lord stayed away from abraham so once abraham and sarah separated and they were alone then god came to him god had been there's things that god had been doing been leading him guiding him speaking promises to him but now he says once he had separated now the lord could come to him in a more personal way now the lord can make the promise even greater give him more revelation once he had separated once it was him and his wife separated out then god came to him you say well why well partly to get to the image of genesis chapter 2 and then also because everything that lot represented that further separation out of babylon further separation even with the land of canaan to the seed the bride the elect now that is separated out brother and said god came to him the lord stayed away from him until he did that now he's come to this image it says in genesis 17 1 when abram was 90 and you 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god look at what happened in abraham's life once he separated genesis 14. he's got power to run off in the rescue lot then melchizedek come and meets him genesis 15 he appears to him in a vision i am thy shield and thy buckle i am thys exceeding great reward and he's speaking giving him visions and he and revealing himself genesis 17 now he hears the voice of the lord and god speaks to me appears to him says i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect can i say it this way walk with me this is what he's wanting to this is what he's wanting to portray here's adam and the woman they have this particular image god is raising it back up so what does he do to abraham once he's separated once he's in this place he's in memory and he's in this plane in hebron there god says now walk with me and be perfect genesis chapter 18 he appears to him once again veiled and flesh this is the acceleration of the promise this is the further manifestation of melchizedek and got himself to abram once he had separated then god came to him making himself more pronounced and known to him walk with me be perfect walk with me and be perfect that's the result of walking with them what does this signify what does this represent genesis 3 8 i know this is in the judgment scene but says they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day what did it signify the presence of the lord this was not a strange incident this wasn't they sinned and all said and god showed up but this was something that was customary then in the cool of the evening god himself would come his presence would be declared by his voice and says the voice of the lord walking in the garden declaring the presence of god brother brahm said she and her husband walk in the cool of the garden in the evening and talked face to face with god this is the image in the garden of eden one man and his wife and a god who comes to him and walks with him and makes himself known face to face so then in the life of abram once he's separated out from lot melchizedek comes down and serves him communion god appears to him in a vision god speaks him in genesis 17 then he comes down again veiled in flesh and after the two messengers go down into sodom there he is revealed himself and his plan further to abram and his wife wow that's the pattern that was in the garden that's what god is wanting to resurrect and bring back up so he portrays it in abraham where she and her husband adam and the woman walked in the cool of the garden the evening and talk face to face with god then abram is doing the same thing in hebron in the plain emra and then not to leave don't want to leave us out because what is this signifying and representing the seed which is christ the royal seed witches you what you just think of all the things that we have been taught in the message of the hour adam was given a bride to reproduce himself she fell christ was given a bride to reproduce himself she fell but in the end there'll be a wife who won't fail there will be a wife that won't fail and so you represent the redemption you say god was going to make that woman again he made the man again the second adam and he never failed but he wants to bring forth a woman that will never fail and this is who you are and who you represent and so this is a beautiful principle to to consider that we're taught in the message of the hour the millennium is is a restoration of an eden condition that existed on earth before the new heavens and the new earth and the eighth day in the new jerusalem comes down to settle on the new heavens and the new earth right that'll then be a a eden we can say restored but something that god was always hiding and holding back because that's what he was going to achieve and he hid the plan of redemption so then god allows the millennium to unfold and this is what brother brahma said as adam and eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years now jesus our last adam in his eve the true church will fulfill all the plan of god the bride with her bridegroom in the millennium is going to fulfill all the plan of god so what was interrupted in genesis 3 the plan of god what is resurrected in genesis chapter 12 the plan of god what is finished with you and the bridegroom the plan of god this beautiful picture and pattern this profile in abraham but the mike if you'd come i'd like to finish with this statement from abraham and his seat after him he says so now it's by grace that god called you not what you did not what you could do or what you will do can we just accept that it's not what we did it's not what you could do it's not what you will do it's all him we should have there there's just there's this this carnal brag is not in this at all if you are the seed of abraham god spoke to you by his amazing grace just like he did abraham in the 12th chapter of genesis god's going to give you the same experience that abraham had as soon as abraham believed god by justification believe in the lord we are justified immediately god called abraham to total separation from all unbelief again this is what's represented in lot not so much that you need to get away from your uh your brother's son we can't have any nephews in our life that's it's it's not this physical isolation and dividing families and and being nasty with it it's the unbelief primarily the unbelief he says he had to separate from all in belief that's what he's that's what he's done you separate yourself from your kindred from all your associates come out of the pool room come out of the dance hall come away from the things of the world that's what it represents god calls for a total separation to abraham's seed because that's what he's called that's what he called abraham and notice the question he asked are you patterning it is that a word patterning that's what you're doing that he said are you following in that pattern are you patterning abraham we need to ask ourselves he's the profile he he's the he's the pattern he's the image are we following in that image is my life fallen as an example isn't it beautiful to look back and relate to the life of abraham and abraham had faith to offer his son on mount moriah and i have faith to believe for the change of this body because i'm going through the same paces and the same process as my father abraham going through the exact same thing that he did being put in the position to have that unfailing faith are you patterning it this instrument is abraham i thought that was just such a tremendous statement this instrument is abraham an instrument is something that's used to accomplish a person purpose it's a it's a means by which something is done an instrument to do something or is something that's used for a purpose but also it's used to measure something that's used to record something used to control so abraham is god's means of recording it's his means of of measuring the instrument is abraham and we're measuring ourselves by this instrument abraham this instrument represents this seed after him so he's the control he's the measure he's also the means by which something was accomplished he's also uh the the what's used for a particular purpose but now he's the he's the measure he's the recording he's the controlling he represents this seed after him and the covenant was made to both abraham and his seed after him and as abraham was called by grace by election so was his seed called by grace and election they heard the voice of god and believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness heard the voice of god in a bar room everywhere it was and believed god and abraham was commanded to abstain and to separate himself from the things of the world and so is the seed of abraham separate themselves from the seed of the things of the world but a beautiful picture that god wants to paint in the life of abraham we went into a little bit more detail about lot just just to understand how god is wanting to use this figure in abraham's life to express something to us unbelief the lingering influence of babylon and how it ends up in sodom and gomorrah how it was drawn to the well-watered plains and it was drawn to the beauty of this natural life but yet was lurking behind all that was this wickedness which is exactly what mr babylon is and how abraham was content to watch his nephew choose the choicest land and abraham is content because he knows it's all his anyways and so god comes to him afterwards and says i want you to look around as much as you can see and in in perfect not just in by way of assumption he's actually telling look around and as he looked around he would have seen exactly where lot was and everywhere else also god reminds abraham don't be jealous don't be worried i'm going to give it all to you anyways don't be as david in the psalms would fret why did the wicked prosper and why did they flourish and why did they get away with this and why did they get with that god comes to abraham and says listen don't for a moment be bothered by lot getting the best in this life or getting the best right now it's all yours anyways listen laodicea has nothing you should be jealous of the world has nothing you should be jealous of there's no position no prestige no popularity politics whatever it might be there's nothing you should allow to cause any kind of sting or bitterness in your spirit as the world would want to intimidate you and wave it in your face it's all going to be yours eventually anyways man i may not ever be able to have a house in cave creek but it's mine anyways i may not ever be able to own a house in a high rent district i may now be able to do this i may not have a video i may not be able to vacation in paris i mean i'll build that but one day it's all gonna be mine anyways why i'm the royal seat of abraham look south look north look east look west this world has nothing that's not yours it's all yours eventually he's wanting abraham just to rest don't worry what lot has and so he brings the separation he brings the divide to put abram in the pattern and the profile of adam the woman because god's going to build that man again and then it starts speaking do you see how much more it speaks to us layer after layer volume after volume the example of abraham's life thank you for your attention tonight could we stand together what a privilege we have in this hour to walk with him what a beautiful privilege we have under the opening of this word as he speaks to us in such beautiful poetry would you walk with me let's purpose in our hearts to do that more perfectly walk with him with our heads bowed let's remember the various needs that we have in our assembly different families at home sick i got a text message today from a family that they're traveling they're out of town and just remember them in prayer those different ones our gracious heavenly father [Music] we praise you we honor you there is no god like you there is no other god besides thee we recognize you to be the supreme one [Music] the god above all the god that is in all from you alone proceeded forth creation light and time and matter your hands made the heavens your voice fashioned the universe and brought forth the earth and in your greatness lord as we praise you and magnify you for your greatness lord we offer thanksgiving for it's in this grandeur of creation and the endless endless galaxies and the numerous innumerable stars in the midst of all of it your attention and your focus is on us [Music] you wanted to express something so beautiful in the life of abraham that in the mass of humanity and the millions that may have populated the earth at the time you come to one man and say i'm calling you and your wife and i'm gonna separate you to where i finally get you alone without even children alone and i'll start there with a beautiful beautiful picture lord and i pray father today that we could check our lives to be sure that we're patterning after abraham not that we should have any kind of nastiness or vitriol towards those that we disagree with or those that have hurt us or harmed us or those that we have conflict with because abraham demonstrated that he can handle conflict and remain in relationship with a family member but he stood his ground and he separated and he was in the promise and he received the visitations may we be able to walk in the same pattern have that same spirit of a christian that abraham exhibited so that we can have this we could have a more rich experience with you lord if you stayed away until abraham had fully obeyed your promise what other areas of our life lord are we missing out on your great blessings because there's areas of disobedience some spot in our lives that we have not yielded to some place in our life that we have not surrendered some some ask of us that you have asked us to do that we have not done that keeps your presence from being made manifest oh lord may we refrain no longer may we be willing lord to receive that promise to walk in obedience to it that your presence could be manifested more greatly in our lives but further revelation lord even some of us kind of get stoved up a little bit and we're not walking and understanding and we're not further being quickened by the message of the hour lord if we could just separate from those things that are holding us back revelation is waiting to be poured out upon us oh god may we obey you tonight whatever unique particular way we find ourselves in disobedience father we pledge to devote ourselves and to come back to you and walk in obedience that we might experience a further unfolding of your word to us bless us we pray now as we're soon dismissed may your presence go with us be with those that are hurting those that are sick those that are mourning lost loved ones those that have decisions that they're facing and they need your confirmation i pray father you grant it reveal yourself make yourself known be with brother elias lord have a grace have grace have mercy o god lord brother david seiler had a gentleman a young a brother lord a wonderful brother in his church had an accident with the explosion of a gas cans lord burn over 83 of his body oh god have mercy on him lord touch him and have mercy brother stephen buckles and intubated lord may you have mercy on him have mercy lord we commit all things to you now father asking that you lift us up raise us up lord we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music]
