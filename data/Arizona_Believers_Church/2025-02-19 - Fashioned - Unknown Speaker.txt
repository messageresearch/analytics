TRANSCRIPT
========================================
1 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 29 but this I say Brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none very peculiar statement and so it's kind of these opposites those that have wives should have a be as though they didn't have wives and you'll see in a moment why but then he says and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they Rejoice not and they that buy as though they possessed not and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away but I would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried carth for the things that belong to the Lord how he may please the Lord but he that is married carry for careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman carth for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married carth for the things of the world how she may please her husband and this I speak for your own profit not that I may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction amen you can have your seats my title is fashioned and just that one word fashioned I'm drawing it from the scripture here where it says that the fashion of this world passes away and I was going to maybe pose the question fashioned is it the word or is it the word world that is fashioning us I just want to take this idea of not just fashion but being fashioned or fashioned or formed or shaped on Sunday we took the title of deceptive form and used maybe the thesis that there shapes and forms that leading us away from true beauty and it does so through deception like kind of catching our eye and drawing us away of our own lust and so there's things that meet the eye and certain images that would cause us to be led as stray and we were looking in particular at Deuteronomy 22:5 I think this is a um a welln scripture in the Bible and this is God giving them various laws he said the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God it's not making a distinction that the Garment itself is abomination but rather one that would wear in dress in a way that a man would dress in a way that looks like a woman that displeases the Lord or a woman dressing in a way to appear as a man that would be displeasing that's what Abomination maybe in its most simple way is it does not please God it has carries kind of a sense of something disgusting uh but even that repulsion or that hatred that God would have for something is a consequence of what God loves God's just not hating something uh out of uh preference but rather it's a consequence of him loving something loving Purity and loving wholeness and so if something is not whole or something is perverse God is displeased by it and as the scripture is saying that a woman should dress as a woman a man should dress as a man and one ought not to dress in a way that would confuse that we know that the natures of a man and a woman are different by God's design God designed it that way and in that their Natures are different there's something to be honored in how one would dress and even how one would act we find that the scripture does a lot of arranging man to one another husbands to wives wives to husband and the word addresses a lot of arrangement how we all fit together and how we respect authority and things to that extent so that's uh that's kind of the quick catch up from Sunday now if you look at 1 Corinthians chapter 7 I'd like to start with verse 29 and we'll just read to uh verse 31 but this I say Brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not and reading that it kind of does beg this what do you mean by that and maybe getting into that would be uh would be worth it for some but we're going to focus on verse 31 and they that use this world as not abusing it a lot of contrast in those that have wives though you don't have wives you that cry don't be as you're not weeping and rejoicing as though you aren't rejoicing and but then it says those that use the world be as don't abuse the world it says this for the fashion of this world passeth away I'm going to try to be very deliberate in how we go through this with uh the intent that we would wrap up at a decent time so that we could baptize brother Edward but he says they that use this world that use is to actually means to receive a loan or borrow from it says here the world to make use of the world so it's be by some help or agency of the world or by the means of the world uh you're getting something out of the world I think his brother Ernie Villa used to always say when he would go do his job and he would go speak at seminars he do he sell seminars he'd say I'm going to get a little gold out of Babylon and he knew that's where he was getting it but he was going to use that gold to further the kingdom and I was thinking of how that in the Exodus in Numbers Chapter 20 and then even in chapter 21 one how that when Israel was on their way to the promised land and they needed to pass through Edom and they needed to pass through the amorites that they said we will you let us pass through and we're going to stay on the road and we're not going to venture off the path because we want to get to the promised land and we're not going to take of your crops and your fields and then they went so far as to say but if we did drink your water if we did take from your Vineyards we'll pay for it uh and but they were not going to get off the King's Highway they were not going to get off the path and so I kind of had that in mind when I thought well here those that are making their way through the world and they need jobs and need this and they need that we're making our way through the world we're using it uh but it says but don't abuse it now World here the word the Greek is Cosmos means the adorning or ornament a decoration or adornment it's kind of the harmonious Arrangement or condition of something now when might be I think we understand that word or we've gone through it before but they that use the this Cosmos this the world order and it's translated to adorning in 1 Peter 3:3 who adorning so that's the world whose World speaking to the women or to the to to Christian ladies whose world or who adorning who ornament or decoration let it not be that outward adorning of platting the hair and of wearing of gold or on putting on of apparel let's just be some real strict legalist if we took this and tried to translate it to mean let not your adorning be on the putting on of clothes where would we be as a church as Christians so there's something more to it than just saying wow if you braid your hair you're a sinner and if you wear gold you're you're you're a sinner no it say don't let your world uh be you trying to look attractive don't let your world be I'm trying to signal I'm trying to express uh and when I say signal I'm trying to express that I'm I'm beautiful and I've got this uh quality or I got this kind of hair I can do these certain things it's don't let your adorning or your world be all about those things so they that use or borrow from or make use of or use the agency of the world and all that it would have its order its Arrangement it's adoring as not abusing it the word there abusing means to use fully and so it's to use excessively it would even imply that you would not just use it but you would use all of it that if it's there I want to take all of it if I if it's an opportunity I want to take full advantage of it or I would use it to where I'm not just making use of it but I'm getting I'm getting everything out of it to the point to where it's a detriment now becomes harmful harmful it's no longer in its moderation so it has some sort of negative impact in The Exodus as the children of Israel were passing through Edom and they were not granted passage and then when they asked of the amorites if they should pass through uh not only did they say no but they gathered themselves against Israel to try to stop them but if they had they been granted passage uh they could have began to take so much of the world to where they would have owed more to Edom they would have owed more to the amorites or they say well you know this is a pretty nice uh plot of land here this is good ground let us stay here there was a point at which they would have made use of what was available to their detriment so it says they that use and I would say we all use this world how many here tonight got here by agency of traveling like a thought by Supernatural power my eyes I'm I'm watching here I want to see where we're at as a church well we've got a ways to go here and so we use the world on some level and I promise you if if someone from a couple hundred years ago saw what you drove to church tonight and how you made it to church they would say witchcraft sorcery we would have the Phoenix Witch Trials once again uh because there would be some kind of what kind of black magic is this uh but yet we use the world we made our way here tonight using things of the world but it says those that use the world and I would say all of us do don't make full use of it don't make your world about worldly things and it gives this reason for or because this is why it's the only one he really gives he does with respect to marriage this is the first one where he gives some sort of clarification because the fashion of this world passes away that word passes away actually means misleads or leads astray or leads aside and so you do get the sense that it departs or changes or it's uncertain world the world's fashion the fashion of this world misleads or leads aside it'll lead you on and the word fashion here is a Greek word schema and it's comprising everything in a person that strikes the senses so the schema the form of something the figure the bearing the the actual uh actions and the manner of Life The Habit and in particular the appearance of a person how a person appears is their fashion or their schema comes from the Latin word habitus did I get that right brother doctor did I get okay good that's the condition or the appearance or the dress of a person both in the Greek schema even in the Latin habitus it comes back to to have or to hold to Echo to to wear to be situated to think about something considerate to have in mind to manage or to keep how many of you use the term schema and your job or maybe your uh whatever field you might be in there's some sort of structured framework or a plan that's the schema that form the appearance it means the external condition and it's saying that the world schema its fashion its habitus its manner of life and its habits is always changing it's always Meandering it's always leading on it's not real stable and consistent it it its Fashions and its forms its passions and its Norms all those different things are always changing in Jeremiah CH 23:10 speak of the land of Israel it says in Judah for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth and these false uh vows the pleasant places of the Wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not right the course is evil the force is not right this mode this style of running uh or course of life people just rushing into wickedness the force that might the influence the leadership the power the things that are driving things that are moving things are contrary to God's nature they're contrary to God's way so there's a force in that this time it says there's a course in the land there's a force in the land that is evil that is not right and Paul is saying that the world uh is always changing the Fashions of this world are passing away why because there's a force there's a course in this world that is not right courses and forces and things of this world that are shaping and forming what's normal what's acceptable what's ordinary would you agree that there's there's there's a influence and sometimes we can say it's societal pressure or it's economics but there's forces there's powers in the world that come to bear on things and make certain things acceptable or normal in Ephesians chap 2 veres 1 2 and 3 it says you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins so we rejoice in this verse that we have been made alive in Christ Jesus Jesus and now he does something which can be very sobering is he points back to what life was like before you were quickened where in time passed ye walked you lived you conducted yourself according to the course of this world the Bible told us the course is evil and according to the prince of the power of the air this is the force that is not right Paul says in Ephesians chapter 6 that these are the things that we're fighting against the God of this age these principalities these powers of Darkness these rulers in high places says the prince of the power of the Earth the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience so when we were in the world we did the things of the world by the force the course and the power of the world he calls it a spirit that works in Children of Disobedience among whom also those children we all had our lives our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others by this uh course of this world the prince of the power of the air appearance is always changing uh but the influence is always the same the Bible says the the the fashion of this world passeth away you say well it looks this way one time and it looks this way the next time but it's always the same influence it's an evil course it's a a a it's an incorrect Force here we see it's the course of this world the prince of the power of the air a spirit causing us to fulfill the lust of the Flesh and of our mind and it's the wrong kind of nature it may look different at different times but it's the same evil the Amplified Bible writes it this way in which at one time you walked habitually you were following the course and fashion of this world you were under the sway and tendency of the present age following the prince of the power of the air you were obedient to and under the control of the demon spirit that still constantly Works in sons of Disobedience the careless the rebellious the unbelieving who go against the purposes of God Amen now I'm taking time to cover this and again our service will be brief this evening just to show that there's powers that cause us to live even habitually in wickedness or sin being born in sin and by Nature being a fallen creature there's powers of Nature and nurture of the world that drive us to do things that are against God's nature and against the purposes of of God 1 John 2:16 tells us all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life which none of those things are of God but is of the world not the Natural Earth but of the world the cosmos its order it's it's shape its force and in in Romans 12: 2 I just I am grateful for your attentiveness tonight and your concentration it's it's very helpful he says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so there's kind of two different things uh that we're being informed of to be conformed to this world or transformed into the perfect will of God the representation of what is good and acceptable and the perfect will of God a confirmation to the world or a transformation by the renewing of your mind to God's word and this word conformed it means to Fashion yourself according to to shape yourself to another's pattern uh one of my children shared with me something that uh their aunt aunt Anne shared with them and it was kind of funny because it said the the Press shape is putting in put into a shape press to be pressed into a press shape and it was just one of the it just keeps repeating itself over and over again a and so that if if you're going to be conformed you are going to be pressed into the shape of another shape you're going to be conformed it's to shape one thing like another now when that happens though this word that's being used it's used to describe what changes what easily changes and what is unstable so it's transitory so when you're conformed to this world it's not something permanent you're just kind of you ever taken a piece of paper and bald it up and throw it in the trash can and didn't think about about it again till about 1:00 in the morning and it sounds like there's just a whole pot of roaches in your trash can what's happening that shape you press that piece of paper into it was temporary now it begins to open up and it sounds like right and it sounds like something's moving in your trash can well this is the kind of conforming you you can be molded one way right you can be a total skater one day and then a punk the next and you can be a Roper the next and now you're going to be an athlete why you just kind of go with the flow and you change and your desires and taste will change because you conform to this world and it tells us that there is a pattern or form or a habit a look maybe even a style a way of life that is shaped and is overtly worldly I think we should all we should be able to accept that now we might have different definitions of what worldliness is but I believe as Christians who read the Bible we should know that there is a lifestyle there is a way of looking and dressing and acting that is overtly worldly because it's that which the world has shaped you into and it's only the renewing of our minds that will change us from the form of the world into a fashion approved by God it's only by the renewing of our minds that we can be changed from that one image or that that temporary unstable fashion into an approved image of God now I'm going to make some statements here that are just kind of summarizing a lot of things and if I could put it this way the bride's Cosmos the bride's Cosmos her order her world is the order and the arrangement and the fashion of the word we can have a world which is created by the word of God in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth by his word so there is a world that is ordered by the word of God but then there is a world that has been perverted from the word of God and it's a different order it's a different Arrangement so we say in the beginning was the word that created all perfect things and in John 1 we find that in the beginning was the the word and that the word was made flesh in Jesus Christ amen I want I want you to think about those things that there is the word which creates all things that even when the world was in this mass of chaos God's spirit and the word worked upon that to bring forth order it was an indiscernible chaos and darkness was upon the face of the deep and so there is God loves order he loves simmetry he loves Beauty according to his word that word was made flesh in Jesus Christ and this is the world that's the world that God loves it's that original adornment that original Harmony it's the harmony of God with his creation and brother John was even fellowshipping with me on this at the very beginning of the year Cosmos in the Greek means good order in proper arrangement in the beginning God looked at his creation and said this is good this is very good that was his Cosmos and it's the same word and the same root that we get Cosmetics from or cosmetology cosmetology is the art of of beauty culture if something is cosmetic we realize that affects you say well that's just a cosmetic thing it's something that affects only the appearance of something so there's a lot of things maybe a lot of rabbit Trails we could go down with respect to cosmetology I would argue that maybe God was the first cosmetologist and that God uh was uh God was using cosmetics and different things and and I'll say it this way because to say that God looks upon the heart and that God is looking for substance and God looks for character is not to say that God disregards our appearance absolutely God doesn't see things as man sees it as uh uh Samuel said to about David say well we're looking at all the sons of uh Jesse and saying that the strong the tall the more accomplished the ones that to the eye look like a saw said those are the ones that we would make king and Samuel says God doesn't look upon the outward appearance he looks on the heart that that's what God is looking at is the substance and the character of somebody and so God is concerned about your heart he's concerned about what's on the inside God wants to see faith and that's what pleases him but that truth does not stand for another truth or does not stand for the proposition that God only cares about the heart and completely disregards our appearance that's right you can't that that that truth does not could not be used to argue that oh well it doesn't matter how we look that you could not take the Bible and construe it that way God's original Cosmetics were the word of God or was the word of God that was his adornment his arrangement his Harmony that harmonious Arrangement and this is I will say this is maybe a mouthful in saying this God wants even our physical appearance to portray a spiritual message that's what the Bible was concerned about even in the law that's why the New Testament is as has as much breath as it does is that God wants even our physical appearance to portray a spiritual message the word is the word is spirit and it's life and the word itself is uh seems to be something that's intangible spirituality is something that's intangible it's hard to uh you can't just get your fingers on it and it can be certainly mimicked and portrayed the wrong way and since the things that we believe in is a god that is unseen a world that is in another realm or a a word that is that is thought that is principle God wants your life and even your physical appearance to portray a message and to portray a truth and a reality that sometimes can be very Elusive and cannot be grasped God wants even the way that you appear to convey a spiritual message because it's necessary to convey Christ there's uh in none of us have I don't think any of us have ever stood in a lineup of suspects and number five police step forward right and they put everybody together and they're supposed to look a certain way and and they're going to say I'm going to look at all these people I'm try to figure out which one is the Christian and so God would want us if we were in a lineup he would want someone who would have enough knowledge of the word of God to look at a lineup go oh well I mean they're the ones that appear to be a Christian now it doesn't mean they absolutely are but there's some word basis for living holy and righteous and living above the things of the world where God wants our lives our our conduct our response to things our language and even the way that we dress to to portray his word and his character as we've used this quite often Titus 2: 11 and 12 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present World righteousness godliness the spiritual sobriety never changes when it comes to God's word or God's Cosmos or God's world this is never out of fashion to live righteously and soberly and godly and and to Titus he's saying in this present world in the time that we're living now Grace is teaching us how to do so not under the law and under this thing that was maybe uh too much Cosmetics to where there's nothing changed in the heart but those of us who've experienced this regeneration by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you who have now been quickened who have been made alive in Christ Jesus who are to put on the new man who is renewed in Holiness and righteousness that we are to live Godly deny ungodliness deny worldly lust and live above the world but yet in this present world if there's something that God hates hates if something God hates becomes socially acceptable God doesn't change his mind God doesn't say I hate this sin a a and everyone's like we hate it too God we hate it this is horrible and then some time passes and all of a sudden everybody's like well we don't know if it's as bad as we thought it was and God says well you the people have spoken I guess I I'll take it you know we'll just we'll forget about it and Malachi says just because I haven't punished you for your evil Deeds doesn't mean my attitude towards evil Deeds have changed now I want to use an example of this because what we've hopefully led up to this point is this idea that there is a fashion of this world it's even a look it's a portrayal it's a cosmetic it's something this order of this Arrangement and it's always changing and yet there's a God who is unchanging and who wants even by our physical appearance to not be passioned after the world he even wants us to have a godliness in the way that we would look and it's closely connected with the word of God now as I've been looking at these things there is a gentleman from uh Great Britain whose name was James lver and he was uh actually a curator at a museum and I wanted he came up with these laws of fashion was first published in 1937 so I updated some of the language he said like the current Trend or the current fashion which would be smart you know what would be in today in the now right now would be smart we would say it's Swag or drip and that's what we'll use for all the adults here so we can all be on the same page right now presently whatever is fashionable uh people like well that that that looks sweet or that's spiffy that's sharp that's smart that's elegant whatever the words might be uh to describe what looks really good that's a fire fit or a lit fit whatever it might be now the his law I'm going to do it maybe a little bit backwards but his law says that in one year if you were dressed the right now a year from today in 2026 if you were dressed in the style that was drip a year ago now you're basic right right adults that's what we would say if somebody was wearing something or you would it would be dowy right that that's that's not cool that's basic it's so last minute 10 years after the present fashion was dri 10 years later the laws of pass say that it would be cringe to dress that way and then if you go 20 years it would be ridiculous and if you went 30 years it would be kind of amusing at that point right it be more costume and then but 50 years it's there's a quaintness to it you go 70 years it's charming and then finally after 100 years it's romantic and then 150 years it's beautiful why because through the passage of time at one time that's hot that's what we like right there that that's that's what is uh that's what all the fashionable people are doing and then a year later it's like you're still wearing that that's so basic and then if you keep wearing it you get to be cringe it gets ridiculous amusing but then it'll work its way back to where it's not necessarily drip again but it's it's romantic it's beautiful there there's some sort of nostalgia to it now this is the part I really wanted I wanted you to see in these laws of fashion five years earlier it was Shameless one I guess I got my order mixed up here let's just put them all up there one year earlier to have dressed a certain way would have been daring 5 years earlier it would have been Shameless 10 years earlier indecent so one thing that at one time now notice how the laws of fashion work that in 2015 there could have been something that if you dress that way and I think we have to go further back to the 1930s to really get our heads around this that in 1915 if you were dressed a certain way it would have been illegal it would have been scandalous it would have been indecent and then in 5 years it's not so much illegal and indecent but you don't have any shame you don't have any respect and then a few years later ooh that's pushing the envelope that's that's daring but then what was indecent which became Shameless but then just became a little edgy then becomes drip becomes acceptable becomes fashionable and the very thing that was indecent because something that's embraced is fashionable and then once it runs its course it becomes basic it becomes cringe but then even look it back it could be beautiful and what we might call beautiful today 150 years ago could have been indecent and vulgar then and these are the laws of fashion this is exactly what Paul is pointing out when it comes to the things of this world and the Fashions of this world passing away is it one time the world could be up in arms and literally Pearl clutching because some is vulgar and indecent but give it some time and it might become Shameless then it becomes daring and oh that's really Progressive you're on the edge then it becomes socially acceptable it becomes fashionable and then the rest is more fashion turning against itself instead of society itself gaining a moral compass and having some right attitude toward sin this is how the world works and what I want you to think about tonight is the fact that if something was in fact indecent Abomination or disgusting or displeasing to God God's law does not change the present fashion and how that you ought to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world if God had a drip it wouldn't change wouldn't become basic wouldn't become romantic it would have never been indecent or Shameless though to the world it might seem to be cringe or it might seem to be quaint or homely but to God those things are always in fashion because God never changes brother bradam and the sermon does God ever change his mind about his word he says see the politics and things how they're trying to join the church together by a politics in the church we're not joined to Christ by politics we're joined the church to Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the way you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost is because that Spirit In You identifies every word of God to be the truth for whosoever shall take one word out of it or add one word to it his part will be taken from The Book of Life yet he prospers you say you can't believe that by Prosperity you can't judge God by Prosperity the world prospers balam prospered by it brother you judge God by his word he keeps his word and identifies it the truth so remember friend as long as you live don't you ever forget this God does not change his mind yet he will bless he will let you go his permissive will but he won't change his mind he won't change his plan he won't change his word for you no sir you have got to change you can't have God's word to match your experience you've got to have your experience to match God's word there's no way that we could take the church ages or the Bible or the history of Israel and and take it and come up with God's law of fashion and find that God 10 years ago considered something indecent and 5 years later just considered it Shameless and then a year later considered it daring and then God's like I like this this is good God's like that's fire stick with it a little bit and then a year later go well that's kind of basic Christians and but we need to find the latest and greatest the next thing that has the people moving why the fashion of this world is always changing something that was indecent years ago now people don't even think twice about because that's how the world the world works now in Philippians chapter 2 verse 8 so we read earlier and I maybe I'll just read it again quickly here we we're doing really good on time I just have uh three more scriptures and we'll wrap it up and it says and they that use this world is not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away that Cosmos that adorning that decoration that Arrangement or Constitution speaking of Jesus Christ it says and he Christ being found in fashion as a man this fashion of the world the world Cosmos the fashion of this world schema he was found in fashion the schema as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so there is the fashion of this world there's a cosmos uh that has a scheme or fashion and the Bible says that Jesus Christ was found in the form the appearance or the fashion the external condition of a man but he still humbled himself to God they didn't view Jesus as some an alien life form they didn't view him a a as an outlier as a matter of fact that's what made him so mad is it's like you are a common ordinary 50-year-old looking man born of a c Carpenter you got some rumors about maybe where you come from and he was so common that it enraged them there was nothing about him that distinguished him and his form or his Constitution or his appearance Jesus Christ was found in the schema and the fashion as a man he would we could I could even say that he would use this world but he didn't abuse it and although the fashion of this world is always changing God's word remains unchanged Christ was found in fashion the schema the habitus in the habit and manner of Life as a man he would eat he would sleep he wore clothes like they wore he wept as they wept in every way he was tempted like as any other man would have been tempted and so Christ in the form of a man remained obedient to God he humbled himself and was obedient to God's purpose it's the same to today Christ in the form of human beings never changes now the Christ was found in the fashion as a man in the condition then that first century Christ looked like a man of the first century and Christ today as we've used the phrase the 21st century Christ may look just like a man in the 21st century but there's going to be something unchanging about his nature and his ways right the Bible says be not conformed to this world as it says in Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren Christ Jesus Christ was found in the schema the appearance as a man but yet he was without sin there was a righteousness there was a rectitude there was Integrity there was something in the way that he could live in that world in that present world and live above the world it wasn't some overt over-the-top uh ttoo or something he carried around a sign it's only the 21st century Antichrist that carry a sign saying I'm Jesus right and and identify themselves in that way Christ allowed his Works to speak he allowed he he he he demonstrated a character in the way that he lived his life and so now those who are forn or predestinated to be I I believe I'm speaking to those tonight to be conformed to the image of Christ the Bible says be not conformed to this world but be transformed and now it says that we're to be conformed to the image of his son though the word is the same in the English conformed to the world or conformed to the sun two different words in the Greek in Romans chapter 12 it's conformed to this world is that which is temporary changeable and unstable here it speaks of that which is the essence in character that which is complete end durable not just merely a form or an outline so we're to be conformed to the image of his son that means there is some expression and listen your duty is to express Christ I like how it's even sometimes used in uh in the telling of the book of Acts that to go and uh heal the sick and save the lost and and to rescue this and to do that and then after all these things it says and use words if necessary why because there's a way that you can live your life that is expressing that is declaring and it is your duty to express Christ not so much in just our words though our words must carry some weight and be used as a a Christian currency to win others and our speech to be seasoned with salt so it's certainly a component of that but we cannot just blend in completely with the world and expect that through some sort of Osmosis or nearness that the point is going to get across God wants us to dress and act like Christian men to dress and act like Christian women so that his message can be heard and to be conformed to the image of his son it speaks to something is durable in its nature so that what is expressed is not temporary it's not just a form or an outline though the form is there its heart its core is durable the essence in character he reading where in these different places about uh God not changing his mind I can't remember now if this was invisible Union but God praying he says God mold me and make me different do something God make me in your fashion I know that's a heart work something that takes place here but what works here works out that's right it it's going to broadcast it's going to share it's going to express do you realize that it's been our lives that have in has inappropriately framed the gospel at times I I I would not want to take your experience of away from you and as much as you've all known me I wouldn't want you to take it away from me but we know one another's weaknesses and we've made mistakes but yet we realize that inside of each one of you there's a genuine experience with Christ there's a love for the word of God there's a passion for the things go there's a desire to serve God but we realize sometimes our attitudes our responses the way that we've handled situations maybe even the way that we dress and the things that we've done has inappropriately framed the gospel and caused it to look in a way that's not attractive to God and worse yet unattractive to the world or to those that are thirsty a lot of the ugliness that we see today in Christianity so-called Christianity is not the nature and spirit of Christ let's I I was fellowshipping with a brother about this even today how a lot of the initiatives on diversity and equity and inclusion we would have never needed it if CH if America had remained a Christian Nation that's because we would just would have you know beat up all the Sinners no Christians are not spiteful and hateful Christians are not concerned with uh with Brute Force tactics and and shaming people no they would you know the Bible actually tells us to shame the ones who pre say they're Christians and do things ungodly not the ungodly who are all about it right it's the one who's claiming to be a brother who's doing things that are ungodly he says that's the person you put to an open shame that's what the Bible says and the our nature our character disposition it ought to be in such a way I know I'm a broken record I keep repeating myself over and over again please forgive me if it is becomes worrisome but even down to the way that we're dressing we need to convey the humility of Christ John chapter 17 verses 14 to 18 consider this maybe for uh one of the upcoming services on this particular subject the Bible says that friendship of the world is enity with God some sort of where you say well I've Got Friends in the world no that's not what it's saying I really like my boss that's not what it's saying there's some Affinity some connection and relationship to the world that puts you in opposition to God there's a way that we can be spoiled after the rudiments of this world that put us in competition against the purpose of God the spirit which we have received is not the spirit of the world but the spirit of God we've been chosen he says in John 15 out of the world but notice how he prays in John 17 I have given them Thy word and the world hath hated them because they you to whom the word of the Lord is come they are not of the world even as I am not of the world that's remarkable he said I come from God I go to God and just as much as Christ was not of the world he was found in fashion as a man in his schema in his appearance in his manner of life he he looked like a man who is living in the world but yet he was not fashioned after the world so he prays I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world but thou should us keep them from evil here we are and we may pray daily and I certainly wouldn't object to a constant cry Lord take me take us from here let us go meet you in the air let this Rapture be finished let's go uh be changed in a moment there may be this crying out I we want to go to that place and we want this life uh to to move into that cycle of fullness of redemption but yet he says I don't pray to take them out of the world I just want while they're in the world that they be kept from Evil kept from the force that is not right to be kept from the course that is evil so he repeats it they are not of the world even as I am not of the world he's repeating himself so that you'll get it so he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world you're in this world but not of this world you have been called out of the church you've been called out of the world but then sent back into it in a way he says behold I I be harmless a a as doves and wise as a serpent because I send you out into the midst of wolves and that is exactly what he has done there's a way that we ought to be in our discernment there's a way that we ought to be in our character because we've been sent into the world not to become like the world not to become friends with the world not to be confused with the world and not to draw our swords against the world but to make our way through the world through this wisdom and through this humility that it could find others who themselves also are not of this world who've been doing their best to try to fit into it doing their best to try to get uh um some identity out of it I'll have our brothers come to their instruments if they could and I want to end with this statement from the sermon God's power to transform you'll find that this sermon is just replete these two different ways that he preaches this subject are just full of these statements even does God ever change his mind about his word God does not change if we love the world and the things of the world the love of God cannot be in us it's got to it's referring to some world it's that world that's always changing if you love the things of the world and you say oh I just I just love the drip of the world now I just just love it I just love it's just percolating all those things that I enjoy and I love well just know that in give it a year you're going to be basic to the world so what does your love have to do has to change your likes your wants your wishes all the that's just what the world does it changes but God never changes and A Love For The World displeases God because where's the where's the stability everything's transitory just look at what's happening in America right now at one point it just looks like eventually we're all going to have to declare some other gender as a backup right and it's the way that it's going we're thinking man this thing is going full hardcore to the left and then all of a sudden the very people who were propagating forcing everyone to wear certain t-shirts and to put things on there uh to declare pride in certain things now they're like reversing course right it's all going the other way and what is it that's not a Christian Resurrection that's not an upswell of morality what was cool now is basic or then is basic now and one day it's just it's going to be qu it's going to be quaint to have been queer he there's going to be some Nostalgia to it oh you remember when we were all changing our genders all the time that that's that's a that's not that's not a moral movement that's the way the world works so where's the word where's the Christ today who never changes even though there may be some appearance as a man looks like a woman who lives in in in America looks like an Arizona teenager looks like this but yet we real the stain in the smell of the world is not on them they look human they act human they have all these different qualities and characteristics as a man but they they're of a different order he says now the word here is not Earth it's talking about world it's a Greek word Cosmos which means the world's order if we love Fashions of the Earth the world if we love the trend of this day if we think this is a wonderful time oh have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it's perverted by the devil now I realize the the debate is well what exactly is he referring to to to uh Church of Christ they might think these windows and this piano is of the devil right right that that a paradigm oh well that's that's worldly uh to some communities if you have electricity you know that's just a pipeline of evil and we're not debating the morality or which is which is better I'm just acknowledging that there is sometimes this idea that these things are overtly evil and I believe that there is a line there is a there is a path there is a way of life there are things that are overtly worldly we need to challenge ourselves with the Fashions of this world if we love the trend of the day oh it's Wonder we have these things that's enjoyable let get everything we can out of him he says but it's the wrong kind of thinking it's perverted for if you love The World's order and the things of this present world it's because the love of God is not even in you because the love of God is not even in you wow that just has a way of hitting really hard so I really like this and I really like this and I enjoy this and I enjoy that check up check up and ask yourself have I become so consumed with the world as he says let not your adorning be of these things maybe we could put ourselves in that as men let not your adorning be these things so that when someone thinks of you oh brother so and so this is what he is and you're identified with a male equivalent of plating of hair a male equivalent of Recreations and desires and things that might have to do with things that are of the man and that's what you're identified with camouflage and buck urine or whatever it might be there's a way that there well that he's a hunter somebody the other day was telling me about somebody and said oh do you know so and so yeah that guy's a a gun guy and then I asked somebody else about the same guy it's like do you know him he says yeah he's a gun guy and complet two different people whose arcs don't cross and they both know this other guy he's a gun guy well okay maybe we could be known for something but wouldn't it be nice if somebody said oh yeah he's a Christian oh yeah he's a good guy he's honest he's got decency he's got Integrity no judgment on the gun guy just used him as a to make a point gun guy forgive me especially if you got guns [Music] Lord help us to be amen fashioned by his word you're going to be fashioned and if I'm going to be fashioned I want to be in that Timeless way that God loves I'll be in this present world but I won't be of this world I won't be formed and shaped by this world yes I can I can dress with a modern suit I can wear a a modern thin tie I can I can wear wing tips I can wear leather belts I can I can have I can wear in a dress in a way that any lawyer on Wall Street might dress or how this person might dress but in doing so I would still want to portray a spiritual message of Christ praise the Lord if we could just stand to our feet this [Music] evening we'll pray together with you all and what I'd like to do is at once once we've prayed just as the song we're singing and just be dismissed uh uh to our baptism uh brother Edward as a church we consider a great privilege to be able to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so as we gather around the baptismal he'll share uh if there's a short testimony or just whatever testimony he might want to share we give him that opportunity to do so but as we bow our heads tonight I just ask if you have a a prayer in your heart just lift it up before the Lord our gracious Heavenly Father tonight as we close our service as we've taken maybe 45 minutes or so to walk through a very simple principle of being fashioned I trust that the believer has been able to pick up on that theme in the word maybe even for our young people or anyone that might be struggling just to recognize there there is a current in this world that tries to P push us towards certain things Lord I I know it for myself there's things I see sometimes like oh man I I'd like to have that and then you realize that in doing so it is signaling a certain fashion or a certain style or certain look that could inappropriately identify ourselves with something that displeases [Music] you Lord May the be a reckoning in our own lives just an a spiritual audit a continual searching Lord I want my life to please you and this word which can be so elusive in your nature your spirit which man is not privileged to handle physically Lord even as it were Thomas was of the mind he had to see it he had to be uh proven by evidence but what about those who have not seen and yet believed Lord that's us so Lord I pray that that spirituality of the word of God that you desire to be portrayed in flesh that I could do so I want to do that Lord for the sake of the gospel for the sake of the expediency and I pray that you bless all that are here tonight that you be merciful to them in this subject matter Lord I know there's maybe a lot of lines that we could cross or a lot of lines that we can make very Stark and nail it down really tight but Lord I pray that at the appropriate time we could get into it so that we're approaching it from the right angle Lord I pray that you bless our baptismal service brother Edward Munos Lord you've been working in his life now for some time brought him to this place tonight to desire to be baptized on his birthday I pray that this would just be uh such a special time in your word and in your presence may he never forget this time this moment this day Lord we ask your blessing upon our visitors and those that were with us this evening as we're dismissed may your presence go with us we ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ am amen
