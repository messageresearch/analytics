TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title is ugliness and so if you feel targeted tonight you might have a complex about your looks uh but we do want to deal with the subject of ugliness and our text from Deuteronomy chapter 17 and just verse one Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bulock or sheep wherein is blemish or any evil favored for that is an Abomination unto the Lord thy God Thou shalt not sacrifice un the Lord thy God any bulock or sheep wherein is blemish or any evil favored this for that is to sacrifice any one of those things is an Abomination unto the Lord thy God Amen we ask God to bless these words that we've read tonight you can be seated if you just keep your finger there let keep your Bibles open to that and concentrate on that I want to pick back up there on this verse and as we've already mentioned our title is ugliness we'll come back to that here in a moment but as it says Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bulock or sheep wherein is blemish or any evil favored so it is a bulock which encompasses a lot of different livestock sheep wherein is blemish or evil favor that is offered for sacrifice so it's not that a sheep with blemish is an Abomination to the Lord but it's when something is presented as a sacrifice or an offering to God he considers it a an abomination I just want to take a few moments to look at that uh term or things that are an Abomination and it means a disgusting thing something that is detestable or abhor a loathsome might be a word that we might use and how many here have heard the word Abomination before I'm not saying an Abomination I'm saying Abomination and it is a disgusting thing or something that is detestable and an Abomination generally in the Old Testament was just something disgusting or foul I know when we think Abomination we think in terms of maybe something as we've just read that God detest but there are different things in the Bible that are referred to as an Abomination uh and they're just things that would make you recoil or make you turn away and think oh that's disgusting in Genesis 43:32 and it's speaking about Joseph and his Breen and they set on they for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians which did eat with them by themselves because the because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews for that is an Abomination unto the Egyptians so to the Egyptians there were things that they considered detestable or disgusting and here the sons of Abraham uh they would not eat with him they would not eat with the Hebrew because they would eat things in animals that the Egyptians worshiped and that's one speculation and so they they were offended if you sat down and someone thought that the the hamburger you're about to eat could have possibly been their ant they might find that to be offensive so there were Abominations to the Egyptians this it has nothing to do with one true God it has nothing to do uh with anything scriptural or spiritual the Egyptians found what the things that the Hebrews would eat they found him to be an abomination in Leviticus 19:7 it says if it be eaten at all on the third day prior verses speak of an offering to the Lord when it may be eaten and then says if it's eaten at all on the third day it is abominable it shall not be accepted and this word here is pigou which means to stink and let's just use um our experience if you have to use your imagination a little bit I'm sure you'd be able to but if something has been left out for a few days it begins to rot and the Bible is saying if you eat anything on the third day it's a foul thing it's refu it's garbage uh at that point it's begin to rot it's unclean and so it's saying it is foul smelling it should not be accepted you should not eat something uh Beyond uh this this third day or on that third day so this is the original FDA telling you how long you could keep meat out at room temperature and then there are things that we've read about here in Deuteronomy 17 these things that we just mentioned the bulock the Sheep weing his blemish or evil fness for that is and this phrase is an Abomination unto the Lord thy God in other words these are things that don't just smell bad after 3 days or things that someone would find defensive but these are things that God finds disgusting these are things that God would say would are loathsome to him or detestable and remember we're we're learning his way and I just want to come up with a list of rules that we can abide by but know his ways and why is it that this is required and why is it that God uh asked us to do these certain things and not just try to come up with an end result or product but to understand why God uh feels this way or even why the Bible requires things of us so there are things and I hope that was pretty simple there's things that can be an Abomination to anybody there's things that can be an Abomination because they're rotting they're unclean it's not healthy to eat it but then there are things that to God he despises them and this is a God that we know in Malachi 3:6 says for I am the Lord I change not amen therefore there are things that God despised then and he despises them yet today there's things that God would find detestable he still hates sin and as he says in Malachi 3 just because I've kind of lingered here and I haven't judged these things doesn't mean my attitude towards them has changed and here we see in Deuteronomy 17 that God hates a blemished sacrifice that blemish there speaks of a spot or a defect it's refers to a physical deformity or some sort of moral stain is how that spot can be used sometimes and if I let me say this just to maybe help Focus you guys in a little bit I'd like to be able to give some context to the God's requirement or his love for Holiness maybe give some perspective to Holiness and understand why would God ask us to dress a certain way why would he God ask us to abstain from certain things and so that's that's what we're looking at in detail tonight God hates a sacrifice that has a blemish as we saw in this word uh on Sunday evil favored if it's evil favored it lacks that beauty of symmetry it is ugliness it's something that has some sort of uh deformity it's the opposite of divine proportion we think we mentioned it this way on Sunday an unpleasant or unattractive condition or appearance I know we probably never say uh do you think I'm evil favored or does this look evil favored on me uh that's not the kind of question we ask but it has something to do with the same sentiment that if something doesn't look right something doesn't isn't visually pleasing it's something that's unpleasant or unattractive Ive so what we're looking at tonight is this evil favored or these things that might have some deformity or blemish and we're calling it ugliness a very unpleasant thing to the sight or something that is unsightly we could even say that it's repulsive in appearance or something that is morally offensive it's ill-shaped that's what we mean by ugliness and I'm drawing from Deuteronomy 17 wherein this principle is that no sacrifice and we'll look at some scriptures here at Exodus 12:5 No sacrifice could have any blemish No sacrifice could have a sickness or or some disease disease it could not be ugly to the sight or have a be foul smelling in Exodus chap 12:5 even before these sacrifices are instituted by law says your lamb shall be without blemish so during the feast the first Feast of the Passover the lamb that they were to choose was to be one without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and God is requiring this lamb to be one without blemish you're going to does it say that oh if you have a a goat with a blemish that's a sin he's saying if you take that which has a blemish and then sacrifice it h you're going to eat it that that's not going to satisfy what I'm wanting to portray here in Leviticus chap 1:3 says if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd let him offer a male without blemish he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord I know many of you uh can begin to think about all those different scriptures in the Bible that speak of an offering without blemish and Leviticus chapter 22: 17 to2 this is a rather lengthy reading we have all the scriptures here on the slides for you but I'm just wanting you to recognize how God is reiterating over over again that a sacrifice an offering should be without blemish it should not be sick it should not be diseased it should not be ugly and it's not to say that we should find goats attractive but I think you get the point and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and to his sons and all the children of Israel and say unto them whatsoever he be of the House of Israel or of the strangers in Israel that will offer his oblation for all his vows and for all his Free Will offerings which they will offer unto the Lord for a burnt offering yay shall offer at your own will a without blemish we know that there's just so many different levels of offering so many different categories these free wills these oblations a lot of things but here God's consistent requirements it should be a male without uh blemish of the beaves of the sheep or of the goats but whatsoever hath the blemish that shall you not offer for it shall not be acceptable for you now here God in laying out these requirements says it's not acceptable to eat something that is rotting and this is Maybe God's cautionary law to preserve them to keep them healthy but now within the law of sacrifices he's saying that to offer something without blemish is not acceptable it's not acceptable for you to do that verse 21 and whosoever offer the sacrifice of Peace offerings unto the Lord to accomplish his vow or a free will offering in beaves or sheep it shall be perfect to be accepted there shall be no blemish therein just one category after another it's saying that if you're going to offer a sacrifice it needs to be perfect it needs to be without blemish now it starts to get very detailed blind or broken or maed or having a wind or scurvy or scabbed you shall not offer these unto the Lord nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar of the Lord this is uh quite the gatekeeping God on in terms of what we can offer and what we can't and and we might find this to be a bit offensive or maybe prejudicial where was the Ada or the I guess it wouldn't be necessarily Americans but animals Disabilities Act and verse 23 either a bulock or a lamb that hath anything super Superfluous or lacking in his parts that mayest thou offer for we free will but for a vow it shall not be accepted you can do it in one category this is your free will but as a for a vow it shall not be accepted it recognizes how God's attitude is on this is your free will if you're going to be given it this is fine but if it's for a vow if you're going to offer something for a vow it shall not be accepted you shall not offer to the Lord that which is bruised or crushed or broken or cut neither shall you make any offering thereof in your land neither from a stranger's hand shall you offer the bread of your god of any of these because their corruption is in them and blemishes be in them they shall not be accepted for you we catch in how God's attitude towards things with the blemish and that when it comes to these sacrifices they ought to be perfect they ought to be something that is not uh in these different categories that he is saying are not acceptable are are you following me in Malachi 1 verses 7 to8 he says you offer polluted bread upon my Altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of the Lord is contempt that is something that is disdained or despised it's vile and since it's vile it's worthless he says and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and this is a rhetorical question because it's to be assumed that yes it would be evil to offer a blind sacrifice we've already read in levius 22 that these things could not be offered for certain sacrifices and if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil and the conclusion ought to be you're right we've profaned you we we we've disregarded you we disrespected you we've even disdained you and we haven't shown the proper uh attitude towards these things and therefore they become worthless because because we're not concerned about what's being offered and then to drive the point home he says offer it now unto thy Governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person sayith the Lord of host try giving the gift that you're giving me try giving it to a governor try giving it to somebody of some esteem try to show some favor to somebody and say here I I I here's an iPad you can have this iPad and you're like oh thank you you look at it's broke it's crushed it's a first generation can't work won't turn on and they're going like okay thanks for the gift and and he's saying you wouldn't give these things to a govern or some important person try it you do it on my altar all the time you do it in your offering and service to me all the time you don't you're not giving your best you're not giving what's required you're giving things that are broken and solid and things that aren't clean and try giving that just to a human being of someone of importance or someone that you're trying to uh show favor to he says they won't accept it either so there's many of these verses that we could use to show God's attitude towards or God's requirement of an unblemished sacrifice a a sacrifice that is not ugly or evil favored and all of these Old Testament sacrifices typed I say all of them because in some way they're all uh can be funneled and towards this one thing they typed or foreshadowed the coming of an unblemished Immaculate Lamb of God Amen in Hebrews chapter 9: 13 and 14 for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a hepher sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of Flesh which we know in these offerings they would have been of a unblemished uh uh bulock or goat or bull and it says if they can sprinkle the unclean and sanctify the pur of the flesh if these things could happen under the law verse 14 how much more shall the blood of Christ to through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God notice how these these offerings that were used in the Old Testament point to the blood of Christ and I apologize that I don't have this scripture there I thought I had it there who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot what what is that without spot it's without blemish it's without these things that we've already read about in Leviticus and and Malachi and so many different places that we could read from the offerings in the Old Testament that to accomplish these ceremonial things and for the service in the Tabernacle now Jesus Christ fulfills everything that they foreshadowed and he was a sacrifice without spot he said this sacrifice without spot how much more can it Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God in 1 Peter 1: 18 to 21 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers that's an accurate way to describe things it says but with the precious blood of Christ you have been redeemed not with a corruptible blood or corruptible nature or with the things that you could get from your parents you've been redeemed with the precious unique and rare blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot a lamb that was not evil favored though there was no Beauty in him that a natural man would desire him and we hid our faces as it were from him there is this Paradox that in a natural sense we would recoil but in a sense of a sacrifice God looks upon it says this is a lamb without blemish and without spot this blood which was shed is the precious blood of Christ who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God what is the Bible telling us we're just using a few verses to make this point in the Old Testament God required a perfect sacrifice in the New Testament we see that Christ was the perfect sacrifice in 2 Corinthians 5:21 for he hath made him to be sin for us he made him to be sin Force this is what happened in that conference when there was hands placed upon the dying lamb there was this transfer of sin there was the scapegoat that was uh there was one that was killed and one that was let loose and it's all symbolizing that one is bearing the penalty one is being made sin uh so that we can have a free conscience and a purged conscience now Christ was made sin for us and the Bible's very clear who knew no sin that we might be made not sin but the righteousness of God in him Christ was the perfect sacrifice without spot without blemish no evil favored who knew no sin sinless spotless Lamb of God you staying with me so far good we'll be making good time in Leviticus 21: 16 to 24 now I really want you to focus intently because I want to use this to speak of Jesus Christ and I believe this is quite remarkable and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron saying whosoever he be of thy seed in their Generations that hath any blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his God these are the sons of Aaron these that would be in that priesthood not just Levites but those that would offer bread those that would offer sacrifices those that would have a very specific uh uh function within the the inner the inner court and even the high priest himself who would enter in to the holy of holies now listen it says for whatsoever ever man he be that hath a blemish he sh shall not approach a blind man or lame or he that hath a flat nose I think I'm okay or anything Superfluous or a man that is broken footed or broken handed or a crookback or a dwarf or that hath a blemish in his eye or be scurvy or scabbed or hath his Stones broken okay I want you to think about just how specific God is getting about the one who can offer these sacrifices nice not talking about someone who could be even a priest or levite or dis certain but it's those that would be forming be performing these special functions they couldn't be a dwarf they couldn't have a blemish in their eye or have scurby or scab some of the same requirements they had of the sacrifice now the one that's making the offering has to have the same requirements couldn't be broken footed or broken handed couldn't be blind couldn't be lame couldn't have a flat nose verse 21 no man that hath the blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire so it's specific he hath a blemish he shall not come nigh to the offering of bread of his God are are you focusing with me because I don't want you just to kind of hear a little bit of it leave and then have the wrong idea verse 22 he shall eat the bread of his God both of the most most holy and of and and of and of the half o blemish and of the most of the most holy and of the Holy only he shall not go UN in unto the veil nor come nigh unto the altar because he hath the blemish God's making a distinction God is saying I'm not trying to deprive you of every right that you might have just how that there were some sacrifices that could be at a certain category that one could give of their own free will that there's no prohibition that you couldn't offer that but if I'm going to accept accepted for certain things and very specific purposes it must be perfect and here he's saying that you can eat the bread of your God from even the most holy or the holy you're not prohibited from certain things but if you're going to come behind the veil if you're going to come n into the altar you cannot do it if you have a blemish because if they did he says he profane that he profane not my sanctuaries that they not be defiled for I the Lord do sanctify them and Moses told unto Aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of Israel now these requirements may seem to be pretty severe and that they would be limiting and someone who had a a broken foot or flat nose or was a dwarf and these different things they would say no sorry you can't perform these certain functions but what was it for was God just uh prejudicial was God just a tyrant was he unconcerned or unfeeling uh it wasn't for any of those reasons but it was because they were foreshadowing the perfect one that would come and that would perform the ultimate function of entering in behind the veil as a bloody lamb before the presence of God as Hebrews chapter 9: 11 uh to 12 says but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come if he was going to be a high priest of good things to come there are certain requirements that he was going to have to have by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to St say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves those a beautiful building that Temple was though these goats and calves were perfect and without blemish but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us amen here is one who was not broken one who is not uh uh scarred or scabbed as a person and morally stained he was one who knew no sin he was Jesus Christ was the perfect sacrifice that all these requirements of God were pointing to now I hope you can recognize then that the Old Testament as God gave his requirements in the law and he said that certain things would not be accepted he was doing this showing that there was going to come one who would be accepted and that by that sacrifice we would become accepted so as the Old Testament foreshadowed Christ now the New Testament previews the coming of a Perfect Bride brother brandom uses the phrase another Masterpiece in the making Ephesians chapter 1 veres 3 4 5 and 6 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him now it's starting to get a little personal we could all laugh when he said up the short guy can't go in behind the veil oh it's funny that the guy with the flat nose can't do this is oh it's sad that the goat that limps can't be a sacrifice and we can look back at the Old Testament just think those are just kind of all weird rules and then we say oh well the reason why is because when God made these requirements he was saying that one day Jesus Christ would be the immaculate lamb who would be without blemish without spot would not be evil favored and he would be the perfect sacrifice who knew no sin whose blood being shed and then offering himself up before the Throne of God the high priest himself entering in behind the veil would atone all of our sins and we sense that oh we're we're forgiven our sins are forgiven and now then when read it it says that he did this that we might be holy and without blemish Without Blame before him in love having predestinate us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved now just as there were sacrifices in the Old Testament that not were not accepted and things that were not acceptable and Jesus Christ was the sacrifice that God accepted now we by that shedding of that perfect blood that innocent lamb we are to be made holy and Without Blame and we are made accepted in him so now we have this uh Union with Christ in this uh in this image of this perfectness in Ephesians chapter 5: 25- 27 it says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it what was the purpose of this sacrifice that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word recall how the Bible there would be things that blood was shed and there'd be a sprinkling and it would be an animal it would be something that couldn't really know sin or couldn't necessarily sin itself but there would be this innocent substitution of a perfect sacrifice and that blood would be sprinkled and the unclean these vessels and things would be purged and made clean and that by their blood things could be P purified and Sanctified and put into use and even temporarily purified the flesh ceremonially before God through these sacrifices now the shedding of Christ's blood is the act of sanctifying and cleansing he gave himself that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now there's this could begin to raise questions like well then does this mean that uh if you have some sort of physical deformity you can't be saved he's that's not what he's talking about because we're we're not necessarily trying to create a visual image as much as we are trying to understand God's way and this is the word work that God has accomplished in us through Jesus Christ and he's washing us with the water of the word to present us a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that we should be holy and without spot holy without blemish or deformity in Colossians chap 1: 18 to 23 we're making great time tonight and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated in enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death we see that symmetry between the Old Testament sacrifices in Christ now we have to recognize that just as those sacrifices then had a Target and had something it was purifying something it was atoning so it had this foreshadowing of Christ but then you're somehow reflected in that too you're somehow represented in these forms and these figures in the Old Testament and he's saying that through the body of his flesh through death he might present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight no notice the language that's being used about you holy unblamable unreprovable and if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul IM made a minister now if we could qualify things this way just very plainly here it's your soul that is redeemed the blood of God having covered your soul the soul that sent it will die the soul now is regenerated it's made new it has been sealed by the Holy Ghost the soul Sanctified and made whole perfect and holy and when I say holy complete by the blood of God through that regeneration by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the soul has been rendered complete and Paul then says that he wants to present you holy and unblamable and unprovable and it says if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel so there is some hope of the gospel there is something that is even forward-looking to those who have heard the gospel and believed it 1 Corinthians chapter 6:1 it says and such were some of you go read chapter 6 to get some more context of all the evil things that were done just by our minds by we were enemies in our minds and alienated from God by these Wicked works that we did by our first nature these things that we received through nature and tradition from our fathers now we are purged from those things and we we were some of those things but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God we are now presented and here we are represented as clean and pure and prepared and made ready are you thinking about this that there's been something prepared there's been something that is washed Sanctified and Justified so that we can be we can have this grounding and this settling unmoved from perfecting holiness amen that God has accomplished these things think of it this way when God has redeemed your soul and he's fitted you as a vessel of Honor that means he's wanting to do something with you that now that he has redeemed you as he has he saved you as he has then there is this mind that at one time did Wicked works now our minds are to be yielded to him to do righteous works so Colossians 3: 4-1 say it this way I trust you're able just to kind of follow me follow me through this the only one who doesn't really need to uh pick up on this is Sister opal right now because she's oh never mind she was listening she just was praying for me thank you sister and cla's CH you know you hate to wake up the little ones it's the adults I'd like to wake up sometimes Colossians 3: 4 to 11 when Christ to his our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory okay Born Again sealed we're we're going to see them now it says mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth and some maybe uh people take this to mean kill the members in your church or but there's this subjugating the your members as an individual as a human mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inord affection evil concupisent and covetousness which is idolatry these things ought not to be named in our lives for which thing sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience why would God judge these things he hates them they're still detestable to him there's no way that we can bring the gospel to a place of Grace and Revelation and bring us in the age where well listen I mean everybody's going to fornicate and everybody's going to lust and these things are going to happen you just got to wear what everybody gives and you can't do this and you can't do that and the government made me do it all sorts of nonsense he's said no these things I've always hated doesn't matter if they legalize it doesn't mean if the world accepts it doesn't matter if all the churches in the world to say hey let's not be so heavy-handed let's just gather people together he gets us right however we are he gets us let's just all say we're second he's first and we love Jesus and anything goes no God still hates sin fornication uncleanness this inordinate affection jealousy all these things that are essentially summed up as idolatry this idolatry God hates and the wrath of God comes upon children Disobedience because they perform these works and he says of these children of disobedience in the which ye also walked sometime when you lived in them before you were born again you were by Nature the children of Wrath and you were disobedient children and you had your course with them and you did these very same things he says but now ye also put off all these now we could say by the baptism of the Holy Ghost well fornication uncleanness inor affection these things are gone but he says you now need to continue to put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another oh could we just go back to verse five please no put these things off too anger wrath I didn't say math wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him as he is Holy so ought to we be holy this is in the image of the Creator the author the painter the artist we've put off the old man who was subject to all those things now that we've put on the new man put all these things out of your mouth put all these things out of your spirit get them away from you where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or un uh cir circumcision Barbarian cian Bond nor free but Christ is all and in all we can't somehow exempt ourselves from God's requirement of Holiness because we're of a different culture now there is some variance in terms of culture and things that are culturally accepted and things that people could do in one nation that maybe we're not except expected to do in this nation but I promise you that there's no exemption from the things that God hates just because you're of a different n culture just because you're of a different ethnicity God may look at it and and see things one way see things a away for all of us and there's things that all of us whether you be Bond or free or Jew or Greek or circumcised or uncircumcised God hates sin if there was in certain cultures that some things were accepted some things were allowed well this is just what we do we get higher we get drunk we fornicate these things are socially acceptable they're not considered sin these things are we're allowed to do the government gives us the blessing we have these certain exemptions you can't legislate on a church level or even on a government level or even on a church level a a period wherein you can just do whatever you want for 30 days it's is it called lent when they're able to do that I can't remember which one it is like there's 30 days where you don't do anything there's days when you do things and I I can't get it um but he's saying these things no matter what you are you got to put away things I hate in Jude verses 17 to2 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust now why would they be mockers they're not mockers in the sense that they say well we don't even believe in a God so we can do whatever they want but they're mocking because they will suggest that they have true Liberty and that they truly know the Lord and in knowing him they're able to be free to explore and to express themselves whereas they mock you that you are somehow in some sort of bondage these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit though they may claim to have it you know by their Works they clearly do not because they will do the things that God hates but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost so there's a building up you have a Holy Faith your soul is redeemed it is it is perfect before God but now you have to build yourself up in Holy Faith praying and Hol keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life now these next two verses are a mouthful but I just want you to kind of catch the flavor of this and some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear so there's you can make a difference by exhibiting compassion you can have a difference in people's lives as your building up this Most Holy Faith and you see people struggling you see somebody lame uh you make straight the paths of your feet so that that lame person can see a right way and those right will tracks he he can do it through compassion says now that there's others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh that we ought to have the same attitude towards something that God has and that if he hates something we should hate it that there should be this correct way of saving someone pulling them out of the fire recognize that God hates and we would therefore hate even the Garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able now the catch this is the the best part able to keep you from falling and to present you fallest before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and forever amen there is one who is able to keep you from falling there is one who is able to see that you continue in these things to put off anger and wrath and Malice and blasphemy and filthy communication to see that you continue in the faith grounded and settled and not be moved away from the hope of the Gospel that we are to have a disposition to where where in our lives can make a difference and we can save some from the fire because we have the same attitude towards sin ugliness evil favored now this to me is the Clincher we've just arrived at 804 and we just have a few more verses to read but they should go rather quickly in Romans 12: 1-2 now this is the the punchline as it were God's attitude towards sacrifices in the Old Testament show that he would not accept an imperfect blemish sacrifice Jesus Christ came paid the price himself as that perfect sacrifice that we too might be accepted and that our lives too would be without spot and blemish now in the Old Testament there was requirements and service and those that would offer sacrifice and things that would be rendered and done unto God and Christ fulfilled those things perfectly even as the high priest even as the lamb and now it says of us I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service this is what you ought to do it's not necessarily a free will offering in that well come as you are remain as you are do whatever you want but now he's saying that you by the mercies of God ought to present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice and he modifies this sacrifice is Holy and acceptable unto God God in the Old Testament would not accept this broken I I I know they kind of getting in this area were well every song we listen to now on K Love or Whatever It Is uh whatever one that's doing which one is it that's always doing a fundraising you can never you never hear any songs but all of them and so there's it's not it's not this this kind of worldly idea of you know every I think a lot of the songs we hear these days is it's 12:00 at night and I'm broken and I'm sad and I had a bad day Jesus be my friend right the nice little banjo track going behind it no there is there is a certain thing that God expects from us to where we're not continuing to do the things he hates the Bible tells us God loves a broken and contrite spirit he will not despise that well why does the bible say that to remind us that there's a certain Brokenness that we can't put in the category of things that God hates but there's a Brokenness that he loves because that Brokenness will tend to wholeness and perfectness and so if we just disregards what he requires here then how we going to get healed over here because we make excuses for our the lack of Holiness and we make excuses for the lack of sanctification it's the reason why we can never receive the healing we need in our Spirits because we're too busy making excuses it's okay to be broken here and wanting God to heal us here we say maybe it's okay to be broken here but not over here I apologize to streamer 123 for screaming we're to present our bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable in other words God is looking for a perfect sacrifice acceptable without blemish without spot and notice how beautifully he begins to amplify this and be not conformed to this world don't be shaped in the image of the world don't don't allow yourself to be forced into some pattern don't offer to me an oblation a a a sacrifice anything that you would offer to me don't offer the world to me don't offer to me something that is in the pattern and the habit of the world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove as a Living Sacrifice prove that which is uh prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God evil favored as we defined it on Sunday was some outward manif manifestation that was asymmetrical that blemished and marred the image of God the the God is a perfect God so something that doesn't look perfect something that would be unclean or foul or stenchy it would be something is that a word stenchy something that would not be the word of the year in 20126 I don't know if you all work on it it might happen but something that smells something that would stink it couldn't be that's evil favored God does not like that God looks down upon that so what he's saying here is that our lives should be a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable in other words our outward expression the way that we live our lives should be free from any defect that would Mar the image of God in flesh we're not conformed to this world but we're transformed by the renewing of our minds that our lives might prove that we are a holy acceptable sacrifice unto God in the Bible Old Testament a sacrifice was to be clean without Abomination and likewise the same our lives in our lives we must strive to be so 1 Corinthians 15:49 is we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly I don't believe we should wait until the meeting in the air to begin to put that on what are we glorifying god with what are we glorifying God what are we glorifying here on Earth are we glorifying God the world in First Peter chap 2:5 ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ recall just how detailed the word of God was for those who would offer literal sacrifice and there is a spiritual application that those of us who are to be offering up spiritual sacrifices that would be acceptable to God our sacrifice then ought to be without spot without blemish and therefore we who are doing the offerings we ought to ourselves be striving for that same lack of spot I believe Romans 6: 12 to 14 puts it in a very beautiful way so that it's not so much us striving as much as it is US yielding let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteous unto God you should say to yourself Lord I want to be your instrument I I want you to use me I I want you to live through me for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace what Grace has done in this hour is it's appeared teaching that we can live soberly and righteously and godly in the now in this present world now before I I'm going to say this can a person in this day and age live holy can a person in this day right now in 2025 can they live above the world can they keep their lives unspotted yes they can now before we try to get in our ideas what that means like oh that means I can't never do this I can't never do that instead of trying to think about what it would be accept the fact that there's a God who's made the promise that if we could just yield our members to him as instruments of righteousness then we could say I I don't I don't I know that Within myself I can never do it I and I'm not expecting myself to live perfectly every day and I'm not expected to live uh where I never have a bad thought and I never make a mistake and I never get jealous and I never lust I'm not trying to present to you some unreasonable standard but I'm trying to present to you that with man this is impossible but With God all things are possible and it's according to his desire and his nature and his way that we could yield ourselves to him and he can continue to work through us in a way that we can become 21st Christ that we could live in the power of Holiness and in the beauty of Holiness in 1 Thessalonians 5: 22- 24 abstain from all appearance of evil abstain even could be restrained or hold back yourself from all appearance of evil I think there's a lot of meaning to this evil here could mean diseased or blind it means wickedness hold yourself from appearing Wicked This is what we ought to do not only is there to be a restraining from Evil when it appears where we would turn our heads Son of God turn your heads I'll set no Wicked thing before me and there's a clear uh pattern in the scripture to where this scripture could say abstain from hold yourself back from look looking at viewing or digesting through sight and through imagination things that are wicked and evil but then it also is telling us as Believers that we ourselves should not appear Wicked we should not appear unclean we should not appear Unholy and before we try to create some Pious idea as a Pharisee of what that looks like we just need to First accept the principle that there is that requirement of Holiness in this hour musicians you could come to your instruments in 1 Thessalonians 3:13 to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in Holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints abstain from all appearance of evil and notice he says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy he's already said in ver chapter three establish your hearts unblamable and Holiness he says in chapter four that the god that ha called us un unclean God hath not called us to uncleanness but unto Holiness so here he is in verse verse 23 of 1 Thessalonians 5 and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy brother John if you could give that scripture and I pray God your Holy Spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it why does he not do it we're not letting him we've reasoned ourselves out of it Lord willing I want to preach a sermon on how sin is unbelief so that we can begin to look at just how of important principle that is that sin is unbelief why is it that we find ourselves not growing in these things is because we're not letting him do it and we can reason ourselves out of it by this what happened and we somehow find ourselves re rationalizing with it enough to it's like God won't do it again let me come back to the point I was making earlier there's things that we Pine and beg and ask God and we pour ourselves out uh to God for and we ask him to do it because we want to be healed or we want things to be mended we want things to get right and we want things to be all perfect in this area God come and heal this part of my life but there's another part over here that is clearly broken and we're not asking God to mess with this why because maybe we don't think this needs to be perfect God saying no I think he got it all backwards I love you this way I can use you this way way I knew you'd be this way and and maybe in some ways God wants us to remain this way Paul sought the Lord three times Lord Heal Me of this Brokenness he said no my grace is sufficient I'll use it and the Very things that we're asking God to heal and to make right and make whole and make perfect that we think is ugly he's saying you know what in that weakness my strength is made perfect and we don't want God to touch the ugliness over here the lack of sanctification the ungodliness the uh the arrogance The Pride whatever it might be the things that God hates if we are God's City if we are his dwelling place then we ought to we ought to put away Abominations CU they shouldn't be in that City if we then are his Kings having been made this city we ought to put away Abominations if we are his Temple and therefore priest within that t Temple we ought to put away Abominations if we are the sacrifice we ought to put away Abominations if we are the ones offering the sacrifice we ought to put away Abominations if we are in the image of God then we must put away Abominations are we clear on this we're we're not going to look at the law as some sort of archaic thing and be like wow we can't wash our pots and sink and we can't mix our Cottons with our Linens no go back to the way of God who says there's things I hate and if he said it 4,000 years ago that he hated it he hates it today it's not the requirement of the law that was fulfilled in Christ that Paul says don't bring us back to that because those are things imposed under the law until the Holy Ghost would come and could keep us now there's things that still remain the same sisters principles of Holiness Brothers principles of modesty and integrity and honest y there's things that have never changed in 2 Corinthians chapter 6: 17 and 18 says wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty we can't read that to mean that once we separate we become his sons but he's saying that if you will come out from among them be separate and touch not the unclean thing that is acceptable then I can be identified with you I will be identified as your father and you will be seen as my sons and daughters flee from ugliness put away all ugliness we ought to disdain ugliness and if there's one thing we ought to be pursuing in our lives on every level and I I'm I I'm gonna we mentioned it Sunday there's very specific things that God has said that we should be doing precise things and it it amounts to the pursuit of beauty that I don't want this ugliness in my life and I know a lot of times we're thinking about how long a skirt is and whether or not it has a slit and how tight a shirt is and whether or not a guy cuts his hair and there's a lot of things that relate to today standards of Holiness and things that God accepts and things that God desires and things that would be imposed upon us but do you realize it's even down to the way that we treat other people the way that we talk and the way that we lie and the way that we mishandle things those all all of those things relate to things that God hates look at the things that God hates in the Old Testament he still hates them today so put away all ugliness put away all this ugliness and pursue Beauty make it a passion of ours the Lord I'm I'm not wanting to be beautiful to the world I'm wanting to be beautiful like you and I want to be pleasing to you harmonious with you if you could stand with me and pray tonight may the Lord bless you may he be your portion our gracious heavenly father as we close this service we'll be worshiping for a few moments singing some songs I ask that you would be kind to your people once again and Lord I feel a sense of urg y to be very forceful that you still hate ugliness [Music] today and that ugliness takes on many different forms and the world tries to dress it up tries to make it seem less ugly deceitful just as the devil did in the beginning but Lord I believe your attitude towards sexual sin fornication adultery lust and a and homosexuality and the abuse of our bodies the intoxications of substances uh lying dishonesty immodesty unrighteous apparel ungodly appearances Lord whether it be in in the use of jewelry and makeup Lord there's a lot of things that we could say well you're trifling and these things are Petty but Lord there's a clear clear picture in the Bible of things that you hate and Lord if we're we're just going to pay lip service to you then we can do whatever we want Lord if we're just going to come and sing a song then dress how you want live how you want but if we are going to be living sacrifices it's clear in the word that you accept certain sacrifices and Lord we cannot be perfect in ourselves nor are we striving for sinless Perfection but what we want is our character to be made perfect and we want our lives to be this bouquet to you he want it to be a sweet smelling incense an aroma that is pleasing not foul smelling not inconsistent hypocritical Lord we pray for consistency that expresses a Divine symmetry we pray for a Holiness which declares a a godliness a righteousness that is from above may we strive for Purity in our language and our conversations and in our thoughts and and Lord before we even begin to form some idea of what's trying to be imposed and to put it in the category of a clothline gospel or just more it echoes of legalism Lord may we just search your heart and find your way and say that if that's what you require I give it and at least accept tonight that there's an ugliness you do not want there's an ugliness that you want to change there's a beauty that you'd like to give us in exchange for those ashes in change for that Brokenness and Lord where we remain hurt and broken and feeble and lame and halt you say I am your healer I am your portion my grace is sufficient my love covers you will not require something from us that we cannot give so Lord I offer my life to you I want you to use me for your glory and I pray that you deal particularly with everyone's Hearts tonight on what this ugliness is so that we could get rid of it in our attitudes and our appearance and our imaginations in our language in our Pursuits we ask all this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
