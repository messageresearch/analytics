[0:00] I have part two of seven women one bride
[0:03] tonight to look at and go back to Isaiah
[0:05] chapter four a little bit uh in this and
[0:08] to start I'd like to read a portion of a
[0:10] statement that we read Sunday morning
[0:11] from Harvest Time and I'm taking some
[0:15] time tonight kind of back up a little
[0:17] bit to explore
[0:19] um how that there are two churches two
[0:22] Vines there's we've talked about twins
[0:24] quite a bit and some of the principles
[0:26] that we're going to go over tonight have
[0:27] been very helpful to me sometimes when
[0:28] I'm reading something that brother
[0:30] Branham says and I'm having a hard time
[0:32] figuring out how that fits with the
[0:34] circumstance that it appears that he's
[0:36] looking to
[0:37] and what he's addressing and you realize
[0:39] that because someone has professed to be
[0:41] something he speaks to them as if they
[0:43] are and so he'll speak in such a way and
[0:47] instead of saying well the prophet was
[0:48] just wrong about who he was talking to
[0:50] you realize there's layers to this and
[0:52] there's ways that the word of God works
[0:54] in certain situations and so it's been
[0:55] very very helpful to me in understanding
[0:58] the words of God in this last day and he
[1:01] says it here in the sermon Harvest Time
[1:03] there are two churches in the World
[1:05] Church natural Church spiritual and we
[1:08] could uh we could just use those terms
[1:10] to refer to the true church and the
[1:12] false Church a natural church and a
[1:13] church spiritual they are called
[1:15] Christians but the church natural cannot
[1:18] raise it cannot resurrect it cannot
[1:20] Rapture it's doing its raising now in
[1:22] the world Council of churches but the
[1:25] Christian Rises to meet Christ because
[1:27] it's a bride to go to meet him so the
[1:30] church spiritual is the one that
[1:31] raptures it's the one that resurrects
[1:32] and that's the church spiritual
[1:34] throughout the age you want to look at
[1:35] it in the template of the entire church
[1:37] ages it's only the true church that'll
[1:39] come up in the resurrection and so it's
[1:41] this natural church that would remain
[1:43] even through tribulation and have to
[1:45] come up before white Throne he says
[1:47] there is a difference in them nature
[1:49] holds these secrets to us and we can see
[1:52] them as we watch them and he's using
[1:55] nature because there's different types
[1:56] that can be used in terms of two
[1:58] different Vines and two different seeds
[2:00] even as brother Branham uses the type of
[2:01] the wheat plant and how at different
[2:03] stages the life's there but as it moves
[2:05] on what remains is a former glare or a
[2:08] former age that people hold to or
[2:09] denominate in and I say that nature
[2:12] holds these secrets I find that he uses
[2:14] the threes quite often you'll see that
[2:15] in a future home that's one of the
[2:17] critical parts to what he's speaking in
[2:19] future home is the three different
[2:21] processes that he recognizes and so as
[2:24] we use the title of seven women one
[2:26] bride I know you probably thought about
[2:27] some of the statements that brother
[2:29] Branham makes about there must come a
[2:31] bride and there's been in many churches
[2:32] and churches and that's what we're
[2:34] looking at there's many women seven
[2:36] women scripture will say but there's
[2:38] just one bride one true church as we've
[2:41] been looking at the scripture there's
[2:42] two women at the Harvest Time called two
[2:44] Edens two cities a lot of different ways
[2:46] that we could talk about it but one is
[2:48] of Satan through the power of the Beast
[2:50] another one is of Christ through the
[2:52] power of Christ and as we looked I've
[2:54] looked at in Revelation chapter 17 and
[2:57] chapter 18 we've looked at the uh the
[2:59] Bible calls it the great and I
[3:01] know that's some aggravating language
[3:02] but that's just exactly the way he calls
[3:04] it and also the mother of harlots that
[3:07] is a way to refer to every political
[3:10] system in the world every government
[3:12] every Kingdom everything that's set up
[3:14] by man is a product of of Babylon it is
[3:17] it is part of that great Harlot system
[3:19] the mother of harlots and every
[3:21] religious Kingdom all organized religion
[3:23] every denomination is all a part of that
[3:26] and it's in the end time those
[3:29] organizations and denominations and
[3:31] everything that man has set up literally
[3:33] rejects Christ
[3:35] even to the point where brother Branham
[3:36] preaches an indictment because they have
[3:38] crucified Christ again so there is a
[3:41] rejection of Christ by this system and
[3:45] in Revelations chapter 18 verse 7 it
[3:47] says how much she hath Glory she hath
[3:50] glorified herself and lived deliciously
[3:53] so much torment and sorrow give her and
[3:57] so there's judgment coming to her but
[3:58] she's glorified herself lived
[4:00] deliciously for she saith in her heart I
[4:02] sit a queen I rule over kingdoms and and
[4:05] I'm the one that's ruling I said a queen
[4:07] and am no Widow my husband's not dead I
[4:09] haven't been put away I'm married he
[4:11] actually claims to be Christ's bride I
[4:14] am no Widow and shall see no sorrow
[4:16] death won't come to me we will persevere
[4:19] this Kingdom will live forever and so
[4:21] this is Satan's church this the one that
[4:24] emerges uh if I could say this way she
[4:26] emerges from the laodicean church age
[4:28] this is the church that you're going to
[4:30] see come out into tribulation it's the
[4:32] one that's represented in the mystery
[4:34] Babylon that survives even after the
[4:36] bride is gone this is the one that's
[4:37] coming under the complete control and
[4:39] the power of Satan this is Satan's bride
[4:42] and as she says that she has glorified
[4:45] herself and lived deliciously and said
[4:46] in her heart she's a queen and am no
[4:48] Widow and shall see no sorrow we see a
[4:51] parallel of this in Isaiah chapter 4
[4:52] verse one it says in that day brother
[4:55] Branham says in future home that's the
[4:57] end time where we're living now
[4:59] he says marriage divorce prostitution
[5:01] what more I saw today that the prime
[5:03] minister of Canada is separating from
[5:06] his wife and I thought to myself this is
[5:08] just becoming more and more common we're
[5:10] political leaders where at one time it
[5:13] was beneficial to maintain the
[5:15] appearance uh and some sort of propriety
[5:18] and Fidelity within their marriage
[5:19] because it meant something to the people
[5:20] that would be voting for him but now the
[5:22] moral condition the marriage and giving
[5:24] into marriage you could break up your
[5:25] marriage you can even be married
[5:26] multiple times and be voted president of
[5:28] the United States and so there's things
[5:30] that just don't matter anymore to the
[5:32] people and right after I was thinking
[5:34] that an article came out and said that
[5:36] mentioned Trudeau separated from a wife
[5:38] and it said it's more common than it
[5:40] used to be right amongst politics and so
[5:42] we're living in a time of marriage
[5:44] divorce prostitution he says what more
[5:46] this is the day the prophet points us to
[5:48] he says in that day seven women shall
[5:51] take hold of one man saying we'll eat
[5:53] our own bread and wear our own apparel
[5:56] notice they have some systems some means
[5:58] of acquiring their own food and their
[6:01] own clothing
[6:02] they don't they're not saying hey can we
[6:04] borrow some money can you give us a loan
[6:06] they have their own system their own
[6:07] economy their own resources their own
[6:09] Commerce their own merchants and as you
[6:11] could see it described in the Book of
[6:13] Revelation clearly they have access to
[6:15] these Finer Things of life it says we'll
[6:17] eat our own bread and wear our own
[6:18] apparel but let us be called by thy name
[6:21] when we read the Judgment of the great
[6:23] Harlot we we see that she's exposed as
[6:26] being mystery Babylon and not the Bride
[6:28] of Jesus Christ we see that she's not
[6:30] the New Jerusalem but she wants you to
[6:32] think that she's the great church she
[6:34] wants you to think that she's spiritual
[6:36] she wants you to think that she's the
[6:37] Church of God and so he says let us be
[6:40] called by thy name to take away our
[6:42] reproach
[6:43] they want to have they want to claim
[6:45] that these daughters and all of us
[6:47] together were from God and we claim the
[6:49] same life and we are all in this
[6:51] together
[6:52] and as I was uh we could draw back to
[6:55] what we're ministering on Sunday that
[6:56] you could take a whole
[6:58] and and we say that the church has
[7:00] rejected Christ now there's a whole
[7:02] other angle to that where Christ has
[7:04] rejected them
[7:05] Christ has rejected This Woman This
[7:08] great Christ has rejected these
[7:10] women the daughters and we see that
[7:12] Christ is offered all the kingdoms of
[7:14] the world political and religious there
[7:16] in Matthew chapter four and he says I
[7:18] don't want them
[7:19] and he couldn't be deceived into taking
[7:21] all these kingdoms because it wasn't the
[7:24] kingdoms that Christ wanted right it
[7:26] wasn't all all the power and all the
[7:28] lands he created the Earth not to have
[7:31] kingdoms but he created it to get a
[7:32] bride out of it and so he rejected the
[7:36] kingdoms so he could pay the price to
[7:38] redeem the Earth so he could have one
[7:40] wife one bride that's all he wanted he
[7:42] wanted one bride and so just as the near
[7:45] Kinsmen I was going to take the land and
[7:47] he said well I'll have the land but then
[7:49] Boaz says well it comes with Ruth you
[7:51] got to redeem the moabite and he says Ah
[7:54] I don't want to marm my inheritance and
[7:55] Boaz says I'll take it I'm more than
[7:58] happy to take this Gentile woman to be
[8:00] my wife and then after he takes Ruth you
[8:02] realize he Nev the land's not even
[8:04] mentioned anymore because the land was
[8:07] he had to purchase the land
[8:09] to get the wife and you see a direct
[8:11] parallel with Christ and that he pays
[8:14] for the sins of the whole world to
[8:15] redeem his bride he's even cleansing and
[8:18] purging the Earth as we see this in the
[8:20] future home and so it cries to reject
[8:22] these women in Matthew chapter four just
[8:24] looking at it and type because he wanted
[8:26] the one bride
[8:28] and these women these uh this church
[8:30] that glorifies herself this mystery
[8:32] Babylon it is it's the false that
[8:35] follows the true this is the this is the
[8:37] twin that emerges after the word Revival
[8:40] and she's the product of deception
[8:43] and she only exists because there are
[8:45] those who are not elect who can be
[8:46] deceived I know that that's maybe a
[8:49] mouthful in saying these things but
[8:51] that's just these are this is the image
[8:53] that the scripture gives us but verse
[8:54] two continues in that day the same day
[8:57] we're living now where there's marriage
[8:58] and divorce and prostitution and what
[9:00] more in that day shall the branch of the
[9:02] Lord be beautiful and glorious so this
[9:04] is something that the Lord has done this
[9:06] connects us back to Christ this root and
[9:09] then The Offspring of David this this
[9:11] branch of the Lord will be beautiful and
[9:12] glorious and the fruit of the Earth
[9:14] shall be excellent and comely for them
[9:16] that are escaped of Israel brother
[9:19] Branham and flashing red lights are the
[9:20] signs of his coming says oh no wonder
[9:22] the Bible says it'll be beautiful and
[9:25] he's talking about how there's the women
[9:26] in the last days the beauty will
[9:28] increase and how that there's going to
[9:30] be
[9:31] uh-oh there's this false woman a woman
[9:34] started it he says a woman will end it
[9:36] and you can certainly look at that in
[9:38] the false but there's also a true
[9:41] it's a true one that's going to end it
[9:42] there's a true one that's being raised
[9:43] up so here when we read that the branch
[9:45] of the Lord shall be beautiful and them
[9:47] that escape of Israel are going to enjoy
[9:49] the fruit of the Earth this is Christ's
[9:51] bride that emerges verse one we have
[9:54] these seven women we have the false
[9:55] glare we have the the evil twin the
[9:57] seven women are the false churches but
[9:59] then the second verse tells us of
[10:01] Christ's bride that one true church
[10:04] and as we read in Matthew chapter 24
[10:07] verse 24 there's many false Christ but
[10:09] there's only one true Christ we see that
[10:11] new testament when they say wait you
[10:13] almost would believe that there's
[10:14] another Christ when Paul says there's
[10:15] not another there's not under the gospel
[10:17] there's not another Christ so there's
[10:18] many false christs but one true Christ
[10:21] there's a carnal church that is a phrase
[10:23] just to describe all the carnal churches
[10:25] all the man-made systems all the
[10:27] denominations and organized religion but
[10:29] there's one spiritual church that is his
[10:32] body
[10:33] and that is the bride
[10:35] now in Revelations chapter 2 let's jump
[10:38] to verse 20. but in the first couple
[10:40] verses there it's the address to thytera
[10:43] there's a great compliment that's going
[10:45] out in terms of their works and then the
[10:48] bookends of works and their charity
[10:49] service and faith and patience that's
[10:51] kind of the the meat of those two
[10:53] bookends and then comes the complaint
[10:55] and there's I do encourage you to go to
[10:58] chapter six of the church age book and
[10:59] read uh the portion where brother Ram
[11:01] deals with this he brings in a lot more
[11:03] history brings in a lot more details and
[11:06] that go back to Jezebel and Ahab and
[11:09] what these things represent so there's a
[11:10] lot more meat on this bone than what
[11:12] we're getting to he says notwithstanding
[11:14] I have a few things against thee and it
[11:16] stands in great contrast to what he's
[11:18] just said about him he says because thou
[11:20] suffers that woman Jezebel and we know
[11:23] that Jezebel his brother Brown brings it
[11:25] out in the church age book was a heathen
[11:27] queen of a a pagan nation that it
[11:30] marries Ahab out of a political Alliance
[11:32] and so there's this union now taking
[11:35] place between Israel which is supposed
[11:36] to be spiritual and religious and this
[11:38] Union with politics so again we see this
[11:40] blending of government and blending of
[11:43] politics and religion and truth and she
[11:46] calls herself a prophetess so she's
[11:48] claiming to speak on behalf of God and
[11:50] claiming to be a religious and we know
[11:52] that brother bam deals with Jezebel
[11:54] religion and there's a lot that he is
[11:56] referencing to the Roman Catholic Church
[11:58] in this chapter the church age book he
[12:00] says to teach and seduce my servants to
[12:02] commit fornication and to eat things
[12:04] sacrificed into Idols These Are
[12:06] Spiritual sins
[12:08] and he says and I gave her this is a
[12:10] remarkable statement I gave her space to
[12:12] repent it for fornication and she
[12:14] repented not just as Cain was given an
[12:17] opportunity if thou doest well will that
[12:19] not be accepted just as the voice uh
[12:21] goes out to the age and there's
[12:23] compliments to the age is the correction
[12:25] to the age there's a there's a
[12:26] correction to the Fallen away and and
[12:29] the organizing and the the committing
[12:31] spiritual fornication the seducing and
[12:33] all these things that there's a warning
[12:34] of Jezebel religion and if they would
[12:36] heed it if they would just humble
[12:37] themselves and heed it then he gave them
[12:39] space to repent
[12:41] but he says they did not
[12:43] so here's the Judgment behold I'll cast
[12:45] her into a bed now I want you to think
[12:48] about the Judgment of the of mystery
[12:50] Babylon and especially in the later
[12:52] chapters in Revelations 18 and there it
[12:54] says and them that commit adultery with
[12:55] her into Great Tribulation except they
[12:58] repent of their deeds so without
[12:59] repentance tribulation
[13:02] and then I will kill her children with
[13:03] death think of how that last horse rider
[13:05] when it comes into full power and how
[13:08] it's death it's riding out he says I'll
[13:10] kill her children with death and all the
[13:12] churches shall know that I'm he which
[13:14] searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I'll
[13:16] give unto every one of you according to
[13:18] your works
[13:19] the church is here
[13:21] represent the mother
[13:23] and all of our daughters
[13:25] represents the and the churches here
[13:27] that do not repent and that commit
[13:29] adultery and are cast into Great
[13:30] Tribulation this would represent the
[13:32] Harlot system all the daughters all the
[13:34] organizations all the denominations yeah
[13:36] brother Branham when he looks at this
[13:37] and he reads this statement and he deals
[13:39] with it in the church age book he
[13:41] identifies that there's two churches
[13:43] True Vine and false fun so there's many
[13:46] churches that'll be judged but if we
[13:48] wanted just to sum it all up there's one
[13:50] true church and there's a false Church a
[13:52] lot of names Blasphemous names right
[13:55] that that are attached to all these
[13:57] churches so one one false church but a
[14:00] lot of names a lot of subsets a lot of
[14:02] llc's organized underneath it and
[14:05] brother Branham writes this in the
[14:06] church age book now why does God call
[14:08] these churches his churches even though
[14:11] they are the false Vine now this would
[14:13] this would give this would be
[14:15] instructive in any instance where it
[14:17] appears as if God is taking ownership of
[14:20] a church that's in the wrong image
[14:23] he says the truth of the matter is that
[14:24] they are Christians
[14:25] but they are not Christians of the
[14:28] spirit they are Christians of the flesh
[14:30] they are bearing the name in vain so
[14:33] there's the pretense we're a Christian
[14:34] church and we believe in Jesus Christ
[14:36] and we believe the Bible and they have
[14:38] their their Creed and their
[14:39] representation and and again it's really
[14:41] subtle because there's a just exactly a
[14:44] way this organized religion and the
[14:46] denominational Spirit likes to present
[14:48] itself such a way to say well why would
[14:51] you take exception with uh with this and
[14:54] we're we're just trying to serve the
[14:56] Lord and don't we all love Jesus and did
[14:58] he die for all of our sins and in a real
[14:59] subtle way it wants to make you feel bad
[15:02] for standing on Truth wants to make you
[15:05] kind of be intimidated for saying no the
[15:07] Bible says this and the Bible says that
[15:09] and it's very clear in the word of God
[15:10] and so they claim to be Christians and
[15:12] God and brother but I'm saying well God
[15:14] will say they are
[15:15] but it's a name only and it's vanity
[15:18] because they're Christians of the Flesh
[15:20] and not of the spirit
[15:23] we see this in Galatians chapter four we
[15:25] see this represented in the lineage of
[15:26] Abraham we know that Abraham had he said
[15:30] an heir in his own home born my seed
[15:33] born in my own home of Hagar and so
[15:36] Ishmael to even Abraham was an heir
[15:40] you know even the one born of his
[15:41] servant he believed to be his Heir but
[15:44] now when he has a son by Hagar he says
[15:46] oh that Ishmael would live before thee
[15:49] even in kind of opposition to God saying
[15:52] no I'm going to give you a son and I
[15:53] still have yet to confirm the promises
[15:55] oh but no I have my own seed from Hagar
[15:58] all that Ishmael would live before thee
[16:00] and God says no Sarah will conceive and
[16:03] shall have a son so he was delineating
[16:05] even from Abraham's own seed and saying
[16:08] there's going to come one that's going
[16:10] to be this seed this son of promise and
[16:13] in Galatians Chapter 4 verses 22 and 23
[16:15] it says for it is written that Abraham
[16:17] had two sons the one by Bond went made
[16:21] and that's the Ishmael of Hagar and that
[16:23] Union Abraham we'd say the right seed in
[16:26] the wrong womb produced a wild child
[16:29] produced a wild man and this is the son
[16:32] of the bond maid the other by a free
[16:34] woman that would be Isaac by Sarah
[16:36] that'd be right seed right womb that's
[16:38] that's where it all lines up but he who
[16:41] is of the Bond woman was born after the
[16:43] flesh but he of the free woman was by
[16:47] promise
[16:48] this is a complete different uh uh
[16:52] category this is by-election
[16:55] that there's there can be children born
[16:57] seemingly born uh of the same Revival of
[17:01] the same word of the same person but yet
[17:03] be of completely different ones just
[17:04] fleshly one's carnal one's born of the
[17:07] man one's born of man's ideas and one's
[17:09] a legalist construct and it's things
[17:11] that are imposed and Things by force and
[17:13] it's all just appearance
[17:15] it's all just a facade it's all outward
[17:17] and inward there's really no
[17:19] regeneration within the soul as I said
[17:21] there's one that's after the Flesh and
[17:23] we call that the shock
[17:25] all right this this is the shock but
[17:26] then the other one is the seed Isaac
[17:28] he's born of the free Woman by Promise
[17:31] by Sarah
[17:32] and brother Branham says this referring
[17:34] to these very scriptures he says
[17:35] nonetheless
[17:37] it is in God's order that the tares grow
[17:39] up with the wheat and that they're not
[17:41] to be uprooted
[17:43] so let them grow up Let the twins grow
[17:45] up let the false Church continue
[17:48] as you even look at it through the
[17:49] church ages he he lets that one continue
[17:52] and it always fights against the true
[17:54] one and it always opposes the true one
[17:57] I'll say this there's
[17:59] um brother Brandon I think it's it was
[18:01] in the other parts of the church age but
[18:04] I don't know if it's the resume of the
[18:05] ages or later the same church age he's
[18:06] talking about the elect
[18:07] and only elect can be born again and and
[18:09] even to say the elect cannot persecute
[18:12] elect
[18:13] now what's the great secret as to why
[18:15] elect will never persecute elect do we
[18:17] know the secret
[18:19] we might think it's because elect knows
[18:21] who elect is
[18:23] so they won't persecute them
[18:24] but it's because elect don't persecute
[18:27] anybody
[18:29] and because the elect don't persecute
[18:31] they never run the risk of persecute an
[18:33] elect
[18:34] so the elector not persecutors they're
[18:37] not condemners they're not they're not
[18:39] Brawlers and Fighters and railers and
[18:41] that that's not what elect do
[18:43] and so there's a we're going to be
[18:45] seeing this where God lets them grow up
[18:47] even though they may be the false mind
[18:49] chokes and the false Vine becomes a a
[18:52] thorn and there's a lot of enmity and
[18:54] animosity of this false Vine attacking
[18:56] the True Vine God just lets them grow up
[18:58] together he said that is the command of
[19:00] God their day for binding and burning is
[19:02] coming but not yet as we read this in
[19:04] the church ages because there Comes A
[19:05] Time In This Harvest Time where they're
[19:06] they are bound together
[19:08] so the spirit is speaking to this mixed
[19:10] group
[19:11] on the one hand he's praising and on the
[19:13] other he's rebuking
[19:14] he is told what is right with the True
[19:17] Believer now catch this because he said
[19:19] there's two churches
[19:21] a false church and a true church
[19:23] Christians after the spirit Christians
[19:25] after the flesh so he's told the right
[19:27] what's right with the True Believer he's
[19:29] complimented the true church now he
[19:31] warns what the false Vine must do if
[19:34] it's to stand Justified before the Lord
[19:37] that that it takes some of this address
[19:40] and identifies that there's a theme in
[19:43] which God is revealing himself
[19:45] and and in incrementally unfolding
[19:49] himself to a true church in a true
[19:52] church growing the life is moving on and
[19:55] how there's this Shadow that's cast or
[19:56] this twin this false Vine that is
[19:59] imitating as it goes and so what is true
[20:02] of the true church
[20:04] isn't true of the false and what's true
[20:07] of the false isn't true of the truth
[20:10] did that make sense I think it did
[20:12] but he but he warns the false Vine what
[20:15] it must do to stand Justified so here we
[20:17] see this warning them that commit adults
[20:19] are going to be cast into Great
[20:20] Tribulation and God's going to kill your
[20:22] children with death
[20:23] and there's that that image then of a
[20:25] True Vine and a false fine things that
[20:27] pertain to this one things that don't
[20:29] pertain to this and then if I could say
[20:31] this a way that God speaks to where it
[20:34] seems as if he's saying it to both
[20:36] but it's only true of the true church
[20:39] now continuing Galatians chapter 4 verse
[20:42] 28 it says now we Brethren as Isaac was
[20:45] are the children of the promise or
[20:47] children of promise notice how Paul says
[20:50] now we are children of Promise we're not
[20:54] of the Bond woman
[20:55] we're not we don't have there's promises
[20:58] that were given to Ishmael going to be a
[21:00] prince I'm going to have Nations and
[21:02] great things are going to come from him
[21:04] he says we're not of Ishmael we are of
[21:06] Isaac
[21:07] but as then he that was born after the
[21:10] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[21:12] the spirit even so it is now
[21:15] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[21:17] cast out the Bond woman and her son
[21:20] for the son of the Bond woman shall not
[21:22] be Heir with the son of the free woman
[21:24] there had to be a separation
[21:27] there had to be a casting out because
[21:28] the The Inheritance couldn't be divided
[21:31] between the two the one could not say
[21:33] well I I'm older and and I need the full
[21:36] of hair it's a double portion and this
[21:38] is the law of the firstborn this is my
[21:40] right this is my inheritance I couldn't
[21:42] even be shared
[21:43] so he had to cast out the Bond woman
[21:46] because the seed the seed of the child
[21:48] of Promise was was only the son of the
[21:52] free woman
[21:54] and then Paul comes to the great
[21:56] conclusion so then brethren we are not
[21:58] children of the Bond woman but of the
[21:59] free
[22:00] therein the example of Abraham
[22:03] and Sarah we see two children
[22:07] that are set forth and God's using this
[22:09] to portray something to us that you can
[22:12] have the right seed with the wrong womb
[22:15] produces the wrong does not produce an
[22:17] heir
[22:18] and then and then but the right seed
[22:20] with the right womb produces the child
[22:22] of promise
[22:23] and the two cannot though they may claim
[22:26] the same father and though they may
[22:29] claim some of the same fleshly
[22:30] characteristics and and our Father
[22:32] Abraham and and have similar experiences
[22:35] saying no you're not equal
[22:38] you're not joint heirs whatever whatever
[22:41] the the son of Promise gets you don't
[22:43] did also it's not one for you one for me
[22:45] one for you one for me no you are cast
[22:47] out
[22:48] so there has to be a separation of the
[22:52] shock from the seed there has to be a
[22:54] dividing out of the false from the true
[22:56] and I think it's so important don't ever
[22:59] let the devil muddy this up and mix it
[23:01] up because if we're not careful we kind
[23:03] of come up with this hybrid a friend we
[23:06] kind of play the part of Dr Frankenstein
[23:08] and we produce our monsters that are
[23:10] kind of hybrid with our ideas and the
[23:12] message and it's something very very
[23:13] scary and it's just kind of mixed and
[23:15] mingled together and we're like well I I
[23:17] guess this is what it is I guess this is
[23:19] what's supposed to be and what you have
[23:21] not done is recognize the bride's
[23:23] position alone in Christ
[23:27] that that she she holds a special place
[23:29] and special designation and and that in
[23:32] that and in that relationship there's
[23:35] things that only apply to her that do
[23:37] not apply to anyone else
[23:40] nobody else and God says I'm going to
[23:42] make a difference everyone else is going
[23:44] to have to go through tribulation
[23:46] everyone else is going to stand before
[23:48] white throne but my bride she holds a
[23:50] singular place a singular position
[23:53] and that can be seen in Ishmael
[23:57] and Isaac
[23:59] it can be seen in True Vine and false
[24:01] Vine
[24:02] and then it has
[24:04] brother Branham uses this quite
[24:05] frequently especially in related to the
[24:08] the seed is not air with the shock he
[24:10] presents it in a single plant
[24:13] and that's when it gets really
[24:14] interesting right because you're
[24:15] thinking oh the wheat plant and you have
[24:18] tassel and you have you have shock and
[24:21] and you have all these different stages
[24:22] of one wheat plant
[24:24] I said well is it the whole wheat plant
[24:26] ordained isn't the whole wheat plant a
[24:29] representative of his body but then we
[24:31] realize in type of the wheat plant that
[24:34] the light it begins a seed
[24:36] and it's the life that travels and
[24:39] everything else is a carrier
[24:41] so at each point uh in the in the chain
[24:45] it's those who have the life
[24:47] and the life moves on and and maybe this
[24:50] is just a clumsy way to try to do this
[24:52] very quickly as it comes to me at this
[24:54] point that if you're in the true church
[24:57] you you're a part of that life as it
[24:59] continues on
[25:01] and it's always the organization that
[25:03] holds back in the stem it's always the
[25:05] organization that holds back in the
[25:07] tassel it's always this deception that
[25:09] says oh no this is it and they
[25:10] denominate it's always the man-made
[25:12] systems and organization that hold
[25:14] people back in the structure of the
[25:16] plant but the life moves on ultimately
[25:18] it comes back to the original again
[25:20] which is the seed
[25:22] and it's at that stage that the shock
[25:24] which was just a carrier in its time
[25:27] begins to pull away at the Harvest Time
[25:29] revealing the grain again
[25:32] so in the type of the wheat plant once
[25:34] we come to Laos to see it Lael to see a
[25:36] shock
[25:38] so brother Branham calls it says
[25:39] laodicea is shock and so as we even are
[25:42] reading
[25:43] in the and the in the scriptures of the
[25:47] seven women and the uh and the life
[25:50] that's coming up through seven Church
[25:51] ages once it comes up to the shock the
[25:54] shock becomes a mocker
[25:56] of the wheat
[25:58] the shock becomes a persecutor
[26:01] of the seed
[26:03] this is the attitude of Ishmael this is
[26:06] the the seed of the Bond woman that
[26:08] content contempt and that animosity it
[26:11] raises up in the shock the shuck hates
[26:14] hates the seed once it gets to that
[26:16] stage
[26:18] I I thought I was going to Romans
[26:20] chapter 9 next but so let me just refer
[26:24] to it we're going to read from he cares
[26:25] do you care
[26:26] because as we have Abraham having two
[26:29] sons by two different women
[26:30] then then it Narrows down even more to
[26:33] you have the same man the same woman but
[26:35] a Jacob and Esau
[26:37] God portraying his election so in the
[26:40] sermon he cares to you carry says we got
[26:42] two churches at hand this morning
[26:44] I I'm reading this to emphasize several
[26:46] things but I I think the quote stands on
[26:48] its own I hope you can absorb this
[26:51] he says one of them is the Church of
[26:53] Pentecost that was organized at
[26:55] Pentecost by the Holy Spirit
[26:57] the second is the Church of the Roman
[26:59] Catholic which was organized in nicaea
[27:02] and he says Roman but it was Rome in
[27:04] Turkey in iosia turkey that's organizing
[27:06] Spirit of Rome so he always kind of
[27:08] joins them together even though
[27:09] geographically they're not the same but
[27:11] that's where Rome organized he says one
[27:14] of them is a spiritual birth that would
[27:16] be the true church the other one is an
[27:18] intellectual membership
[27:19] now if I could say this
[27:22] you don't have to have a Blasphemous
[27:24] name
[27:26] to have an intellectual membership
[27:28] you can have an intellectual membership
[27:30] of the quote-unquote message
[27:32] you can have an intellectual membership
[27:34] in a non-denominational church a
[27:36] independent church because it's when
[27:38] it's intellectual That's The False Image
[27:42] so there's a spiritual birth the other
[27:43] one's intellectual membership from that
[27:45] church come all Protestants all
[27:47] denominations come from that organized
[27:49] Babylon from that mother that was the
[27:52] first denomination all denominations
[27:54] come from that one in our relation to
[27:56] that one
[27:57] Revelation 17 says so she was a
[28:00] and she was the mother of harlots
[28:02] pot can't call Kettle greasy never heard
[28:04] that one except here pot can't call
[28:07] Kettle greasy see because it's right
[28:09] it's just one
[28:10] it's organized it's gone it's in Rome
[28:13] and I guess he's saying that maybe the
[28:14] daughters can't Point their finger and
[28:16] say well you're you're a harlot
[28:19] right they can't do that as the as the
[28:22] other phrases pot can't call the kettle
[28:24] black the the truth of that I think
[28:26] we've explored it here's a church that
[28:28] what is happening is the pot is seeing
[28:31] its own image in the kettle
[28:33] seen its own Blackness its own scarred
[28:36] and and that's the persecutor that's the
[28:38] judger it's the one who doesn't have the
[28:40] discernment to see the truth and so here
[28:42] it can't claim oh well we're Protestants
[28:44] and we've left he said no you're of the
[28:46] same life
[28:47] you're of the same ilk he says it's Rome
[28:48] I don't care what it is it's gone the
[28:50] Bible he says we just come through those
[28:52] Church ages to prove that and that's one
[28:54] of the main things to see through the
[28:56] church ages one is based on spiritual
[28:59] discernment
[29:00] the other one is based on educational
[29:02] and intellectual conception
[29:05] spiritual discernment you must have that
[29:08] you must have spiritual discernment help
[29:11] me to God help me to express this to the
[29:13] extent that you saw a gift of
[29:16] discernment on display publicly to the
[29:19] people in the life of the Prophet
[29:20] through his public Ministry we should
[29:23] desire to have a gifted discernment
[29:25] privately in our individual lives to
[29:28] discern and recognize evil spirits and
[29:30] the tactics of the enemy we we don't
[29:32] need the public display to attract
[29:34] people's attention and and have
[29:36] everything oh my look at that great gift
[29:37] and be on the platform but we need to
[29:40] have spiritual discernment as there was
[29:42] a sign given to catch our attention Lord
[29:44] let me have in my personal life
[29:47] spiritual discernment because that's a
[29:49] mark of this Church of God
[29:52] not educational intellectual conception
[29:54] and then he makes this tremendous
[29:55] statement now that puts us right back in
[29:57] the Garden of Eden again right back the
[29:58] same place
[30:00] when we come to needing spiritual
[30:01] discernment and intellectual conception
[30:03] say here we are back with the woman
[30:05] being enticed a woman being tempted and
[30:08] the church playing the part of the
[30:09] Harlot again but God's bride will
[30:11] withstand that I hope you've been
[30:13] thinking about it through all this I if
[30:15] I could even say this I've been building
[30:17] off of one statement this evil age is to
[30:20] prove you're not like that woman you're
[30:22] not like Eve that this is this is just
[30:25] to me amplifying that very statement
[30:27] that there will be a bride in the end
[30:29] time who is not like that
[30:32] even though the church did it and even
[30:34] Christ Church does it there will be a
[30:36] bride at the end time who will not
[30:38] now a few statements later he says one
[30:40] of them is scientific the other one is
[30:42] spiritual
[30:43] one depends upon the scientific process
[30:47] hypothesizes comes up with theories and
[30:49] and relies upon stats and statistics and
[30:52] and it just needs to figure things out
[30:54] and have everything laid out it's a
[30:56] scientific Church the other one is
[30:57] spiritual
[30:58] think of this one is scientific
[31:00] Arrangement the other one is spiritual
[31:02] discernment of the word
[31:04] one is scientifically arranged what
[31:06] groups of men say intellectual Bishop
[31:10] and he doesn't have to be called a
[31:12] bishop just go by what man says man-made
[31:14] religion man things by force and Things
[31:17] by intellect and Things by uh by
[31:20] structure and Order of man the other one
[31:22] is absolutely born of the spirit of God
[31:24] and lives by the spirit of God and it
[31:26] performs and makes come to pass the
[31:28] words that God promised
[31:31] and he says oh
[31:34] he says have you got
[31:36] shows what toxin you're taking
[31:39] have you got educational toxin
[31:42] have you got the Holy Spirit toxin now
[31:45] pause there for a second
[31:47] and I want this is to me this I kind of
[31:50] just dropped down and just took a little
[31:51] bit deeper layer on this
[31:54] and because we see an image now in
[31:56] churches and we know the woman the
[31:57] church is a woman
[31:59] and brother Brandon is going one to the
[32:01] other one's carnal one spiritual one's
[32:04] Wicked one's righteous just words I'm
[32:06] using there it says one's born of the
[32:07] spirit one's born of man and he's going
[32:09] back and forth so you have church
[32:12] and now the church is represented in two
[32:15] different women or the concept that
[32:18] Christ wanted to have a church the
[32:19] concept that Christ would have a body
[32:21] now there's one that's being raised up
[32:23] by man and it's filthy but another one
[32:25] that's being raised up by Christ and
[32:27] it's pure
[32:28] and what A peculiar position the church
[32:31] has that the church is supposed to be
[32:33] Christian and uh though this all a lot
[32:35] of these Concepts and principles and
[32:37] doctrines these are all supposed to have
[32:38] come from the word of God and pertain to
[32:40] Christ but yet there's a man-made system
[32:41] that's taken it immongulized it and
[32:44] hybrid it and now it's something
[32:45] completely different it's a monster and
[32:47] brother Brandon could say about the
[32:49] church it's a type of all things
[32:51] beautiful but a type of all things found
[32:54] and then brother Branham takes that and
[32:55] says the very same thing about the woman
[32:58] I I think it's important to catch that
[33:00] because when we use the woman in type of
[33:02] a church we're able to kind of
[33:03] disassociate from an actual woman and
[33:06] and our sisters and our wives and our
[33:09] daughters and we're not necessarily
[33:10] thinking anymore of actual real people
[33:12] but when it comes to the type of the
[33:14] woman brother says the woman herself is
[33:17] brought before peculiar position before
[33:18] God
[33:20] and on one hand she is called mystery
[33:23] Babylon on one hand she is foul but on
[33:26] the other
[33:28] on the other she is the the fruit of the
[33:31] Earth shall be excellent and calmly on
[33:33] the other she is she is the Bride of
[33:35] Jesus Christ
[33:38] that's that's that parallel once again
[33:40] where you could have the two and one's a
[33:42] one's an awful system the other one's
[33:44] beautiful I said oh women women women
[33:45] women I think what the critic has done
[33:48] is captured
[33:50] the the severity that the word of God
[33:52] has towards the false woman and try to
[33:55] just bring that through the sieve and
[33:58] present that as being the message say oh
[34:00] you you didn't read it enough
[34:02] this message don't confuse this message
[34:04] with this right-wing nonsense that
[34:06] exists in so-called Christianity today
[34:08] that the woman should be in her place
[34:10] and the woman the women want a strong
[34:12] man and the women want to and where are
[34:14] the real men today and these women that
[34:16] are calling out for real men don't know
[34:17] what they're asking for
[34:19] dressing the way they are living the way
[34:21] they are saying there's no real men in
[34:23] the world today that's what produced you
[34:26] right but there's nothing like this
[34:28] message takes a woman and shows her real
[34:31] virtue and her real place none of them
[34:34] will take a woman and bring her to the
[34:35] equality that she had in the beginning
[34:37] except this message
[34:40] he says all that subtleness of Satan
[34:43] I can paint that picture
[34:46] intellectually can make a man that's not
[34:48] born to the spirit just turn around and
[34:50] around
[34:51] catch that
[34:53] think of that how the intellectual
[34:54] process
[34:55] and these things will cause someone to
[34:57] spin around cause them to turn around
[34:59] but if you have the spiritual
[35:01] discernment born by the word that's not
[35:03] going to phase you or won't get you to
[35:04] turn around it could come against you it
[35:07] could attack your mind but it won't get
[35:08] you to turn around so there's no way
[35:10] intellectually to down them with them
[35:12] there's not a way it's a discernment by
[35:15] faith
[35:16] this is the spiritual church you can't
[35:18] down them intellectually it's a
[35:19] discernment by faith a discernment we
[35:21] see what the word says we believe it
[35:26] there's those two churches
[35:28] one by spiritual discernment one by
[35:30] education
[35:31] one scientifically arranged
[35:34] another one spiritual discernment he has
[35:37] a lot of ways to describe the false but
[35:38] really just keeps coming back to this
[35:39] one thing for the true spiritual
[35:40] discernment by the word that faith
[35:43] now we see this image again in Romans
[35:45] chapter 9 verses 6 to 13.
[35:48] I hope I'm doing okay on time tonight
[35:50] we're very real close to just wrapping
[35:52] up here Romans chapter 9 verses 6 to 13.
[35:56] and not as though the word of God hath
[35:58] taken none effect I think of the preview
[36:01] of the Bride
[36:02] and I think of how
[36:04] the word Goes Forth
[36:06] and then things happen and it appears as
[36:08] if ah
[36:10] This Is What It produced this is what
[36:13] it's come to but God's word will not
[36:14] return void
[36:15] he says for they are not all Israel
[36:18] which are of Israel now what a statement
[36:20] not all Jews are Jews not all of the
[36:23] circumcision are indeed of the promise
[36:26] so they are not all Israel which are
[36:27] Israel neither because they are now he
[36:30] just brings it even tighter
[36:32] neither because they are the Seed of
[36:34] Abraham are they all children
[36:36] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[36:39] so he's saying well the Seed of Abraham
[36:42] no not the seat of him he says not all
[36:44] Israel right he's just bringing this
[36:46] down he says but in Isaac shall thy seed
[36:48] be called remember that Abraham has uh
[36:50] Ishmael Isaac and I think it's maybe
[36:53] seven sons or at least six Sons by
[36:55] Katura I know I should know these things
[36:58] uh
[37:00] and I don't know why I'm forgetting
[37:01] right now but I do know it was Couture
[37:02] that he had other Sons but not even all
[37:04] them
[37:06] nobody's gonna help me and tell me it
[37:07] was it seven was it six you all are
[37:09] intimidated right now
[37:11] if he doesn't know we shouldn't known
[37:13] but we should know these things in Isaac
[37:15] shall thy seed be called he goes that is
[37:18] they which are the children of the flesh
[37:20] these are not the children of God
[37:23] no I'd like to I realize now that we
[37:26] left some things out from the book of
[37:27] Galatians Paul even takes it even down
[37:29] there more narrowly to say that the seed
[37:32] was not even Isaac but Christ
[37:36] and it was not until Christ who was the
[37:38] seed came that the the Seed of Abraham
[37:41] through Isaac is redeemed
[37:43] right and then then the promise is made
[37:45] available to all he says neither were
[37:47] they the Seed of Abraham the children
[37:48] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[37:50] that is they which are the children of
[37:52] the flesh these are not the children of
[37:54] God but the children of the promise are
[37:56] counted for the seed the parallels
[37:58] perfectly with Galatians 4. for This Is
[38:01] The Word of Promise
[38:02] at this time will I come
[38:05] and Sarah shall have a son now notice
[38:08] just how he brings it down
[38:11] to this
[38:13] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[38:15] had conceived by one even by Our Father
[38:19] Isaac
[38:20] for the children not yet born neither
[38:22] having done good or evil that the
[38:24] purpose of God according to election
[38:26] might stand not of works but of him that
[38:27] calleth it was said unto her so when
[38:30] this child was conceived it was said
[38:33] unto her before the ever manifested
[38:35] anyone anything so that we would
[38:37] recognize election recognize God's
[38:39] choosing in this it was said the Elder
[38:41] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[38:43] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[38:48] Paul is taking the the same mom the same
[38:51] dad
[38:52] and saying that God's election separates
[38:55] out
[38:56] there's something and again we have to
[38:59] recognize this is a type there's
[39:01] something so close to this union now
[39:03] where there can be an Esau that seems to
[39:06] whom pertains the birthright to whom
[39:08] pertains the adoption to whom pertains
[39:09] all the rights and Privileges and this
[39:12] would be the one but yet he expresses
[39:14] something in his life that's counter to
[39:17] what God desires and yet in Jacob The
[39:21] Deceiver
[39:23] the hill grabber
[39:25] God wants to portray something in him
[39:27] and he's chosen him by election and it
[39:30] shows the church carnal the church
[39:31] spiritual
[39:32] God constantly showing there's two
[39:35] churches there's two churches
[39:37] and how that there's promises that can
[39:39] be spoken and well this is given to the
[39:41] Seed of Abraham this is given to the
[39:43] church and this is about this and this
[39:44] is about that and yet God is speaking to
[39:47] the one who claims to be it
[39:51] but yet those promises that pertain to
[39:53] it are only for the elect
[39:56] he writes this in the resume of the ages
[39:58] he says for our studies
[39:59] from our studies we've already learned
[40:01] that much of the Revelation is totally
[40:03] misunderstood
[40:05] because we have not formally known that
[40:06] the church spoken of and spoken to in
[40:09] this book does not refer to the pure
[40:11] Ecclesia the elect the body of Christ
[40:13] the bride
[40:15] so there's a pure one these terms these
[40:18] terms weren't introduced by Brother
[40:19] Branham the theologians wrestled with
[40:20] these terms the church the Ecclesia the
[40:22] elect and and there was a way that they
[40:24] just thought well that would be
[40:25] Christendom
[40:27] that would be all that would be all
[40:30] these churches all these individuals all
[40:31] these this collection he says but it
[40:34] speaks to the entire body of people who
[40:36] are called Christians whether they be
[40:38] true or merely nominal
[40:41] think of that I know this is just a
[40:43] principle that maybe begs some
[40:45] application he just says hey this is an
[40:47] entire body of people who are called
[40:48] Christians and he speaks to them as an
[40:49] entire body
[40:50] you claim to be a Christian I'll speak
[40:52] to you as a Christian
[40:53] claim to be a brother I'll speak to you
[40:55] as a brother you claim to be the bride
[40:56] of Christ I'll speak to you as the bride
[40:57] of Christ as all Israel is not Israel so
[40:59] all Christians are not Christians
[41:02] thus we learn that the church is made up
[41:04] of two Vines the true and the false the
[41:06] two Vines are motivated by two kinds of
[41:08] spirits one has the Holy Spirit while
[41:11] the other is endued with the spirit of
[41:12] antichrist both claim to know and be
[41:15] known of God both purport to speak for
[41:17] God both believe certain very basic
[41:19] truths and different differ on others
[41:25] this is where
[41:27] this is where there can be a message a
[41:29] message given
[41:30] and ones to the elect and then there's
[41:32] there's one to the false
[41:34] in the one message because he's going to
[41:36] speak to both
[41:39] because they both claim to be Christian
[41:42] I would say that if there was a pagan
[41:43] Church
[41:45] and they're openly Pagan they don't just
[41:48] wouldn't waste your time don't have a
[41:49] message for them they've already
[41:50] declared what side they're on but it's
[41:52] that false that Satan tries to bring up
[41:54] together with the true
[41:55] so he'll speak to both and there'll be
[41:57] PR there'll be things pertaining to the
[41:58] one things pertaining to the other
[42:02] two Vines are motivated by two kinds of
[42:04] spirits one has the Holy Spirit the
[42:05] other one endued with the spirit of the
[42:06] Antichrist having similar basic truths
[42:09] many different similarities he continues
[42:11] we learn in no uncertain terms that this
[42:13] false Vine is the vine of Satan
[42:16] their Gathering is of him notice there's
[42:18] a gathering by Satan's power they meet
[42:21] in the name of God and lie that they're
[42:23] christs
[42:25] organize religion organize Christianity
[42:28] demonology working within the framework
[42:30] of the Christian Church they preach they
[42:32] teach they baptize they worship they
[42:34] partake of various rights given by
[42:36] Christ to the church yet they are not of
[42:38] God
[42:39] I know this isn't new revelation these
[42:41] are things that have been taught very
[42:42] plainly in the message of the hour
[42:43] Brothers very distinct complain about
[42:45] his entire Ministry these are truths
[42:47] that we ought not to lose sight of
[42:50] but since they say they are God will
[42:54] hold them responsible and in each age he
[42:57] speaks of them and to them
[43:02] in each age he speaks of them and to
[43:06] them
[43:07] even in brother branham's Ministry he's
[43:09] speaking to a Pentecostal Church that'll
[43:11] never receive it
[43:12] but he's got to correct him
[43:15] he he's got to speak to them in a way
[43:16] that says hey this is where you lack
[43:18] this is where you failed this is what
[43:20] you're missing but at the same time he
[43:22] has a message for the elect
[43:24] and I believe it's important that we
[43:25] discern that because he says one of the
[43:27] problems and much much of the problems
[43:28] we have with the Book of Revelation is
[43:30] it's we've misunderstood that sometimes
[43:32] when he's speaking he's not speaking to
[43:35] the true church
[43:36] he's speaking to those who are still
[43:38] caught up in the in the false Church
[43:41] you recognize that do you realize how
[43:43] brother Brown had to preach and this is
[43:45] where the spiritual discernment is so
[43:46] important he had to be able to preach in
[43:48] such a way a message that would catch
[43:50] those who were still caught up in the
[43:51] organization
[43:53] if you had seed that was in organization
[43:56] seed caught up in false Doctrine you
[43:58] could speak to them in a wrong way where
[43:59] they're like oh we're good
[44:01] we're good
[44:03] we're all right but he had to speak to
[44:05] them in such a way to pull them out
[44:07] where they were
[44:09] and then you'll find that there's a harm
[44:10] there's a theme a beautiful message uh
[44:13] in this in the message of the bride's
[44:16] secret and the her secret feast and the
[44:19] things he was trying to break and reveal
[44:21] to her and so brother it's even his
[44:23] entire Ministry is speaking a message to
[44:25] the false Church to call those who can
[44:28] repent out of it
[44:29] and then once you've called you've come
[44:32] out of that there's a pure message
[44:34] that's not just come out come out come
[44:36] out come out come out there's a pure
[44:37] message to you to where you can now
[44:39] begin to feed on the unfailing body word
[44:41] of the son of man because you couldn't
[44:43] do that in organization
[44:48] there's a
[44:50] there's a way that he spoke
[44:53] in the message to where there's a
[44:54] message for the bride
[44:56] and there's a message to get the bride
[44:58] out of the church
[44:59] he had to speak in a way too to where
[45:01] you can't condemn the whole thing
[45:04] you can't burn the whole thing up you
[45:06] can't just chop it all up mess it up
[45:08] because then you could condemn people
[45:09] who are in there who need to come back
[45:11] and then he has to be careful because if
[45:12] he just chops and condemns the whole
[45:14] thing up and then the the True Image is
[45:16] raised up over here
[45:18] so well that's that's strange he just
[45:20] said this was all false this is all this
[45:22] is all bad this is why you really need
[45:24] the balance of the message
[45:26] brother Brandon brother Bram said that
[45:28] you shouldn't send your kids to Sunday
[45:29] school
[45:31] didn't he that's what he said and what
[45:33] do we do every Sunday
[45:35] we send them
[45:37] he said you should take them
[45:40] and a lot of people are taking quotes
[45:41] and chopping them in half
[45:43] and use them as a a club to bully people
[45:47] right
[45:48] right either to punish them into
[45:50] Pentecostalism or punish them into
[45:51] formalism and what they're not doing is
[45:53] taking the message together as God
[45:55] preached it you got to take it all
[45:57] together and I'd say the most important
[45:59] piece is to recognize the further
[46:01] advancement of the life
[46:03] and in there's everything that's been
[46:05] promised
[46:08] so there's a church after the natural
[46:10] church after the spiritual
[46:16] but if I could say this let me read in
[46:18] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 50.
[46:20] I'll say this and we'll just see where
[46:21] where we where we're LED from here
[46:25] Paul says and he's talking about a
[46:27] resurrection
[46:28] First Corinthians 15 his promises are
[46:30] about the Rapture about a resurrection
[46:32] we shall not all sleep we shall be
[46:33] changed there's a many great things that
[46:35] he's breaking to the Corinthian Church
[46:36] he says now this I say Brethren that
[46:39] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[46:42] kingdom of God
[46:43] carnal Church can't do it there's no
[46:45] life in them you cannot have a
[46:48] Blasphemous name and be United to Christ
[46:50] you cannot be an organization you can't
[46:52] be an organized religion you can't be
[46:53] part of a system and fully enjoy you've
[46:55] got to come out of all that and be
[46:57] United to Christ
[46:59] as the Flesh and Blood the thing of
[47:01] Flesh the thing of man all these carnal
[47:03] religions all these false churches
[47:04] cannot inherit the kingdom of God he
[47:06] says neither death corruption inherit
[47:08] incorruption
[47:10] so this inheritance is by election and
[47:12] by relationship
[47:14] and he's talking about inheriting the
[47:15] kingdom of God
[47:17] the world the church which is carnal
[47:20] it cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[47:24] it is it is corrupt that is full of
[47:26] Darkness it is full of death
[47:29] and at the time of harvest at the time
[47:31] of the Rapture at the time the time in
[47:33] which there'll be a resurrection at the
[47:35] time that the Lord is quickening that
[47:38] Rapture cycle death Darkness chaos
[47:41] deception and this great beautiful
[47:44] glorious false Vine that is laodicea
[47:49] that's the condition of the church to
[47:51] come all right away up to Revelations
[47:53] chapter three and the things we've been
[47:55] reading about the church being beautiful
[47:57] and powerful and Rich presenting herself
[47:59] as a queen presenting herself as a
[48:01] glorious Church remember the spirit is
[48:03] so close they could deceive the very
[48:04] elective possible so let's don't just
[48:07] think about a Papal Authority and a
[48:10] Roman Catholic priest and those
[48:13] different images Satan wants to
[48:15] transform himself into messengers of
[48:18] light
[48:19] who can either tell you more about the
[48:21] message than the messenger knew or tell
[48:23] you more about the messenger and what's
[48:24] wrong with the messenger there's
[48:25] different and and even within the
[48:27] framework of it just trying to hold you
[48:28] back in a glare hold you back you
[48:31] manipulate control Mastermind and piece
[48:33] things together in such a way to present
[48:35] even this message to us in a way we're
[48:37] like
[48:38] okay
[48:39] we've got to have spiritual discernment
[48:42] and and let me say this it's not a
[48:44] church thing
[48:46] it's a youth thing
[48:48] because you can't spell Church Without
[48:49] You
[48:51] but it's a you think it's an individual
[48:53] thing
[48:54] something that individually you have got
[48:56] to know that you've met Christ
[48:58] individually you've got to know that
[49:00] you're feeding on the word of God and
[49:02] it's not because you go to a church that
[49:03] looks like it's got everything right and
[49:04] you go to a church that preaches
[49:05] everything right and you want to know
[49:08] that you yourself are feeding on the
[49:09] word of God
[49:11] that's the most important part
[49:13] is to have that that that that knowing
[49:17] because that False Image that false fine
[49:20] is trying to choke the life out of you
[49:23] but right there in laodicea right in the
[49:25] midst of it I want to just kind of cover
[49:26] this maybe very quickly
[49:28] he's there Christ is there stand at the
[49:30] door knocking
[49:32] Christ has been kicked out of the church
[49:34] but Christ is also rejecting the church
[49:36] system because now he wants to call the
[49:37] individuals out
[49:39] and in Revelations 4 1 it says after
[49:41] this I looked and behold the door was
[49:44] open
[49:45] in heaven
[49:46] so we're not we're not just we're not on
[49:48] the earth anymore
[49:49] this is this is an eagle anointing this
[49:51] isn't the age of man this is something
[49:54] that's different that is opening up a
[49:56] door is open in heaven and the first
[49:58] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[50:00] trumpet talking with me which said come
[50:02] up hither
[50:03] and I'll show thee things which must be
[50:06] hereafter
[50:07] what's the hereafter
[50:09] after the laodicean church age has
[50:11] identified itself
[50:13] after she has been she has been
[50:16] identified as being not what she claims
[50:18] to be as she's been as there's been a
[50:20] message given to call the elect out of
[50:21] that there's there's a there's a message
[50:24] of Correction to it says now there's a
[50:26] door open saying come up hither and I'll
[50:28] show you the things that are to be at
[50:30] the end of this age
[50:32] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[50:34] now he sees the door open in heaven he's
[50:37] linking those things together behold I
[50:39] stand the door knock and this entrance
[50:41] is into Heavenly into a Heavenly
[50:43] position this entrance is into his
[50:45] presence
[50:47] and we can say as we've been reading
[50:49] from Revelations 18 4 come out of her my
[50:51] people come out of mystery Babylon the
[50:53] voice of Revelations 18 4 this voice in
[50:56] Revelations 4 1 calls the bride out of
[50:58] Babylon calls are out of laodicea
[51:01] and I know in our minds we want to think
[51:03] quickly to the air but brother Adam says
[51:06] as soon as you've heard the word you've
[51:08] heard from your theophany he says you're
[51:10] raptured up quickly to meet it and yet
[51:12] we seem to stay right here what was it
[51:15] it was a resurrection out of dark
[51:16] denominationalism it was a resurrection
[51:19] out of carnal thoughts and carnal ideas
[51:21] it was this Dynamo something spinning
[51:23] together says the hours arrived for the
[51:26] change
[51:29] calling the bride out of Babylon because
[51:30] there can't be a resurrection in Babylon
[51:33] call no bride out of Leo to see it
[51:34] because there's no life in laodicea
[51:37] the Bible says in Revelations 19 7. I
[51:39] can say Revelations 18 4 Revelations 4 1
[51:41] is calling the bride to 19 7. let us be
[51:44] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[51:45] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[51:48] and his wife hath made herself ready
[51:50] that's the kingdom
[51:52] the marriage
[51:53] brings king and queen back together
[51:55] again
[51:58] and brother Branham says in the Rapture
[51:59] he was the word in his day speaking of
[52:01] Christ
[52:02] you've seen God reflect
[52:04] now God has promised to send us that
[52:07] again in the last days
[52:10] I I just felt impressed to go down this
[52:12] channel because bringing up all this
[52:14] false and again I've tried to tell you I
[52:15] don't want to just end on the the
[52:16] secrets of Babylon
[52:19] right in the midst of all this this is
[52:21] what God's doing
[52:22] in the midst of all this False Image and
[52:24] all this false religion and all these
[52:25] things and again it might be kind of
[52:27] dark for you might be saying well and I
[52:29] know the Temptation has been a lot of
[52:32] times when someone's preaching against
[52:33] something like give us names come on
[52:34] give us names I want to know the URL
[52:38] I want to know who these guys are and
[52:39] there's some there's some habits
[52:41] sometimes where people are preaching
[52:42] against preachers so often you're kind
[52:43] of like just tell me who it is
[52:46] you know just give me names
[52:49] and and there's no point in that
[52:52] as soon as you start using names you
[52:54] could just get yourself in trouble
[52:58] but there's one that we want to know and
[53:00] his name is the word of God
[53:03] he was the word in his day you seen God
[53:06] reflect now God has promised to send us
[53:08] that again in the last days what a
[53:10] statement
[53:12] to bring the bride out of that
[53:14] ecclesiastical mess in the only way it
[53:17] can be done
[53:19] it could be done
[53:21] is for Christ to do it
[53:23] for Christ to call us out of an
[53:25] ecclesiastical mess
[53:28] for Christ to come he's preaching the
[53:30] Rapture what is it he says in the
[53:31] Rapture for the Lord himself shall
[53:32] descend from heaven with the shout
[53:35] it's the Lord himself that descends with
[53:37] the shout what does that shout is that
[53:39] stimulating cry in the parable of the
[53:41] wise and foolish virgins at midnight
[53:43] there was a cry that came and says
[53:45] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[53:48] to meet him
[53:49] what is this shout it is the message it
[53:52] is the living bread of life it is Christ
[53:54] bringing forth the bride what is he
[53:56] doing calling you out of Babylon calling
[53:59] you out of laodice say well brother
[54:00] Aaron I was born in the message I've
[54:02] only ever gone to message churches you
[54:04] have got to come out of sin you've got
[54:06] to come out of denominational thinking
[54:08] you've got to come out of organized
[54:10] religion as the structures exist within
[54:12] the system of the message and you've got
[54:14] to come to him
[54:18] this is where the danger is
[54:21] with church order and good teaching and
[54:23] good preaching and Holiness that the
[54:26] devil could just try to lull you to
[54:28] sleep into surviving within those
[54:29] systems that are thriving in the
[54:31] presence of God but you've never
[54:33] recognized the reason why they're doing
[54:35] it is because they're subject to the
[54:36] word and you don't want to be just right
[54:38] up there in the middle of a Revival and
[54:40] say well this is great this is wonderful
[54:42] and be missing on the very secret to it
[54:44] is that they have tapped into the life
[54:49] oh only Christ can bring us out of an
[54:51] ecclesiastical mess
[54:53] there's a cry that announces the
[54:55] bridegroom's presence for what an
[54:56] invisible Union here on Earth First
[55:00] amen we talk about the future home of
[55:02] the Heavenly bridegroom and the and the
[55:04] Earthly bride
[55:06] it's where the union takes place
[55:08] on Earth
[55:11] is that cry go you out to meet him
[55:15] bride comes out of this message to meet
[55:17] him brother Brown says in the breach
[55:19] there's a whole difference between the
[55:21] church and the bride
[55:22] yes sir went into the wedding supper
[55:26] he says the seals was broke he says why
[55:30] in the last Church age to reveal these
[55:32] truths why
[55:34] the lamb broke the seals and revealed
[55:36] them to his church in order to collect
[55:38] his subjects for his kingdom his bride
[55:42] so the seals were broke in the last
[55:44] Church age to reveal these truths in
[55:46] order to collect his bride for his
[55:49] kingdom
[55:51] what's the king without a throne
[55:53] what's what is what good would it be for
[55:56] Christ to be on the throne ruling and
[55:57] Reign Over All the kingdoms and not have
[56:00] a wife by his side it'd just be a mirror
[56:02] of the perfect of the imperfect picture
[56:04] in heaven when God was all along with
[56:06] his creation
[56:08] he's got to bring his bride to him now
[56:10] and it's the opening of the seals the
[56:13] seemingly controversial endlessly
[56:15] criticized and picked that great truth
[56:17] it's the opening of the seals that
[56:20] collect brings forth not just subjects
[56:22] and servants but his bride to him he
[56:24] wants to bring his subjects to him now
[56:29] the kingdom coming into view
[56:32] and as the bride is going out to meet
[56:34] him the bride is finding her place
[56:36] coming out of Babylon coming out of
[56:38] laodicea what happens to the foolish
[56:40] virgin
[56:42] in type there's things that we can
[56:43] continue to type though brother Branham
[56:44] identified very distinctly the timing of
[56:47] this prophecy come into pass during his
[56:49] ministry he says while they went to buy
[56:52] why because they could buy their own
[56:53] bread
[56:54] hey they can buy their own clothes
[56:57] they they've got a place as they can
[56:59] transact they got Commerce they have
[57:01] Kings they have merchants and while they
[57:03] went to buy the bridegroom came and they
[57:05] that were ready went in with him to the
[57:07] marriage
[57:08] and the door was shut
[57:11] there's going to be a time when the
[57:13] bride is taken
[57:14] the door is shut and all that are left
[57:16] are left for tribulation
[57:18] where them that commit adultery with her
[57:20] cast into Great Tribulation and her
[57:21] children are killed with death
[57:23] that all the churches might know
[57:29] Brothers if you could come to your
[57:30] instruments I'd like to read this final
[57:32] statement
[57:34] if we could just be very sincere when I
[57:36] read this
[57:41] I recognize that there's been a lot of
[57:44] themes that we continue to repeat behind
[57:46] this pulpit
[57:49] as
[57:50] as months turn to years
[57:53] there's those who have grown from a
[57:57] particular time in life where they're
[57:58] not listening
[58:00] and now they are
[58:01] and they need to hear these things
[58:04] it's these these young men and these
[58:06] young ladies growing up in this church
[58:07] all the difference could be just a
[58:09] matter of months
[58:10] we preach something they're just not
[58:12] there yet
[58:14] and the word wants to bring it back to
[58:15] their attention again and you can't just
[58:17] say oh well because because we preached
[58:19] that before they heard it no they need
[58:21] to hear it again
[58:22] some of us find ourselves in new times
[58:24] in life and different cycles and Seasons
[58:27] where we need the word rehearse to us
[58:28] again I'd venture to say there's I would
[58:32] almost say there's nothing I preach
[58:33] that's that's new to any of you
[58:35] when we preach it
[58:37] but it needs to be it needs to be
[58:39] quickened to us in the season that we're
[58:40] living to encourage our faith say yes
[58:42] Lord this is it this is what this is
[58:44] what I need in the hour that I'm living
[58:46] and as I read this statement if it's not
[58:48] for you and then certainly it's for
[58:51] someone here
[58:53] and brother Brown says just exactly like
[58:55] it was when it was flesh here on Earth
[58:56] let's talk about Christ in his first
[58:59] coming
[59:00] in the Son of God now
[59:02] it's being revealed by the son of God
[59:06] as he's come to call a bride out of that
[59:09] system
[59:11] the word is still calling a bride out of
[59:14] a system
[59:16] and I believe he's still doing it for us
[59:19] as we said and uh in in message churches
[59:22] the word is still calling us out of a
[59:24] system
[59:25] the soul is perfect the soul is a
[59:28] Believer
[59:29] but I think our Spirits can be
[59:31] make-believers and there's no doubt this
[59:33] flesh is a unbeliever really just how
[59:35] sick it gets but God's wanting to
[59:37] transform it all
[59:39] as one he did he wants to call to us to
[59:41] continue to purchase of make belief any
[59:43] unbelief and he's calling us out of
[59:46] systems and ways of thinking and ways of
[59:48] doing things and he says in fact it's
[59:50] the Son of God is here calling a bride
[59:52] out of that system he says come out of
[59:54] it be separated saith the Lord saith God
[59:57] touch not their unclean thing and God
[59:59] will receive you and he says are you
[1:00:01] ready to surrender your whole life to
[1:00:03] God
[1:00:04] that's what it takes to come out of the
[1:00:06] system yeah could it be that some of us
[1:00:08] we've come out and we've come out so far
[1:00:10] but some of our thinking some of our
[1:00:12] ideas are holding to the systems he says
[1:00:15] are you ready to surrender your whole
[1:00:17] life to God he says if you are stand up
[1:00:19] to your feet and say I will by God's
[1:00:22] grace accept it right now with
[1:00:25] everything that's in me
[1:00:27] maybe you could do the same if you would
[1:00:30] he said are you ready to spend your
[1:00:32] whole life to God if you are stand up to
[1:00:34] your feet and say I will by God's grace
[1:00:37] accept it right now for everything
[1:00:40] that's in me
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:44] yourself
[1:00:45] I will beg God's grace
[1:00:48] now for everything that's in me
[1:00:51] for you to read it I will by God's grace
[1:00:53] accepted right now for everything that's
[1:00:56] in me
[1:00:58] God take
[1:01:01] all these all these kingdoms
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:05] all these thoughts and all these ideas
[1:01:07] Lord
[1:01:08] in my heart and in my life
[1:01:11] I Surrender him now to you
[1:01:14] could it be that it's in this case he'll
[1:01:17] take any Kingdom you offer
[1:01:19] because he gets you in the transaction
[1:01:22] he gets you and all the worship that all
[1:01:24] the seven women can give can't give him
[1:01:26] what he's after all their songs all
[1:01:28] their platitudes all their Cathedrals
[1:01:30] all their worship everything they have
[1:01:32] can't give him what he's after because
[1:01:34] you're what he's after you're the only
[1:01:37] one that has the heart that wherein he
[1:01:38] finds home
[1:01:40] and I know you're mature Believers
[1:01:41] tonight you gather on a Wednesday night
[1:01:43] because you love the Lord and so I'm not
[1:01:45] chastising you as Sinners but is there
[1:01:47] more more in store for you I say yes
[1:01:50] Lord by God's grace I will accept it
[1:01:53] right now
[1:01:54] by God's grace I will accept it right
[1:01:58] now let's pray our gracious Heavenly
[1:02:00] Father
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:01] we right now accept it
[1:02:04] by your grace and grace alone I accepted
[1:02:09] for everything that's in me and with
[1:02:11] everything that's in me
[1:02:13] I Surrender every Kingdom of my heart
[1:02:16] I yield to you every ambition
[1:02:19] I give to you every Throne every Crown
[1:02:21] every room
[1:02:24] every ideal
[1:02:26] every opportunity
[1:02:28] surrender it to you
[1:02:30] let you be king
[1:02:33] or if I could just put it in the way of
[1:02:35] a husband
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:38] you want our hearts so that you can
[1:02:39] Unite with us in union in marriage
[1:02:43] Lord I just quickly in just a few
[1:02:45] minutes tried to project just how this
[1:02:47] message has the voice of the bridegroom
[1:02:50] in it
[1:02:51] calling us out of Babylon calling us out
[1:02:54] of systems calling us out of our own
[1:02:56] personal ideologies
[1:02:59] breaking away from our spirit
[1:03:02] every image and every Kingdom every Idol
[1:03:05] that keeps us from you
[1:03:08] Lord may we not be afraid of the hammer
[1:03:10] and the Chisel may we not be afraid of
[1:03:12] the sword because the image that's going
[1:03:13] to be left is you
[1:03:16] what's left is going to be the match
[1:03:18] piece that you're looking for
[1:03:21] Lord tonight on a Wednesday I look out
[1:03:24] and see young men
[1:03:26] young ladies
[1:03:28] striving in the peak of babylon's power
[1:03:34] living it at the peak of laodicea and
[1:03:36] deception
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:39] with every kind of Filth at their
[1:03:41] fingertips
[1:03:44] I pray Lord that you pour out a power on
[1:03:46] them
[1:03:49] but you just you come
[1:03:51] and give them a baptism of the Holy
[1:03:54] Ghost in their soul
[1:03:56] now Lord I say this for all that are
[1:03:58] here
[1:03:59] there is a Deliverance for your children
[1:04:03] there is a sanctification of our minds
[1:04:06] there's a power that the son of Gods we
[1:04:08] can turn our heads Lord there's a power
[1:04:10] that loses us from the chains that bind
[1:04:12] us in genetics and and things that cling
[1:04:15] and things that try to defile and solely
[1:04:18] our thinking Lord I believe right now
[1:04:20] the word of God is powerful enough to
[1:04:23] break any stronghold to chase away every
[1:04:26] demonic power to set free every daughter
[1:04:28] of God every Son of God let us walk in
[1:04:31] the Glorious radiant image of a free and
[1:04:35] clean son and daughter of God
[1:04:38] Lord I don't want a glory in the fight
[1:04:40] anymore I want a glory in the victory I
[1:04:44] don't want to just take pleasure in the
[1:04:46] fact that I'm fighting I want to commune
[1:04:48] in the glow of a victory
[1:04:52] Lord may it be that soon after this
[1:04:54] battle has been won in our own flesh
[1:04:57] these great temptations that we face
[1:04:59] that we can commune with you
[1:05:01] King Melchizedek in the presence of our
[1:05:04] enemies
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:06] Lord I believe you're wanting to do it
[1:05:08] deep work in our lives
[1:05:10] Lord I realize you've given me a vision
[1:05:12] Lord
[1:05:14] short-term mid-range long-term
[1:05:16] all right I have different levels that
[1:05:19] you're tracking me by the anointing
[1:05:21] Lord I pray that you would Quicken it in
[1:05:24] the heart of the believer tonight by my
[1:05:26] prayer Lord I'm even verbalizing this
[1:05:28] this is practical Lord
[1:05:31] this will make a difference in your life
[1:05:33] we've seen it in our own family Lord
[1:05:35] we've seen in testimony in our own
[1:05:37] health and well-being the Lord the word
[1:05:40] is sufficient for the daily task and for
[1:05:44] the daily Temptation and though these
[1:05:47] things may seem to be on a level of just
[1:05:49] describing things it's exposing Satan's
[1:05:52] agenda but not just pulling back the
[1:05:54] curtain to Rob Satan of his agenda it's
[1:05:58] gifting to the bride the wisdom and the
[1:06:00] end time and the Revelation that she
[1:06:03] needs to overcome by her Union with you
[1:06:07] by eating the word of God feeding on the
[1:06:11] book to prophesy again oh God I pray you
[1:06:14] Quicken Us by your power quick at us by
[1:06:17] your word and I pray that there be
[1:06:19] revivals break out in every home that
[1:06:22] that there would be our children our
[1:06:23] teenagers would experience a deliverance
[1:06:25] from things that bind them from the
[1:06:28] anxiety from the oppression from the
[1:06:30] even the false ambition Lord and the
[1:06:33] entanglements of the of the apps that
[1:06:35] seem to pervade Lord May there be a
[1:06:37] power cleansing power and a
[1:06:39] sanctification pour out upon our homes
[1:06:42] in our lives to lose the power of Christ
[1:06:46] granted I pray Lord as we commit these
[1:06:49] things to you in the name of the Lord
[1:06:52] Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:56] Hallelujah
