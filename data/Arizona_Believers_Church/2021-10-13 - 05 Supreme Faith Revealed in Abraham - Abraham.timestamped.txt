[0:00] genesis chapter 22
[0:02] i'm going to read verses 8 to 12. i'm
[0:05] not planning on reading
[0:06] these verses again
[0:08] um so i want this just to be another
[0:11] reminder of what we're looking at in
[0:13] that
[0:14] abraham's faith reached its fullest
[0:16] supreme expression when he offered up
[0:18] isaac as a sacrifice so genesis chapter
[0:21] 22 verse 8 and abraham said my son god
[0:24] will provide himself
[0:26] a lamb for a burnt offering so they went
[0:28] both of them together
[0:30] and they came to the place which god had
[0:32] told him of and abraham built an altar
[0:34] there and laid the wood in order and
[0:36] bound isaac his son and laid him on the
[0:39] altar upon the wood and abraham
[0:41] stretched forth his hand and took the
[0:42] knife to slay his son
[0:44] and the angel lord called untim out of
[0:46] heaven and said abraham abraham and he
[0:49] said here am i
[0:51] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[0:53] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[0:56] for now i know that thou fierst god
[0:58] seeing thou hast not withheld thy son
[1:01] thy only son from me
[1:03] let's pray
[1:05] jesus we're so grateful to be gathered
[1:06] together this evening in your presence
[1:09] and we are especially encouraged that by
[1:11] way of worship it washed our spirits and
[1:13] it encouraged us
[1:15] and despite whatever heaviness that we
[1:16] might have experienced or even the
[1:18] things that of tomorrow that seemed to
[1:20] encumber our minds
[1:22] we just felt a little bit of relief in
[1:24] praising you and worship in you and
[1:26] we're grateful for that father and as
[1:28] you have come
[1:29] and made your presence felt tonight we
[1:31] ask that you'd now take the bread of
[1:33] life and
[1:34] rightly divide it to our hearts
[1:36] and we need encouragement lord
[1:39] we need instruction we need direction
[1:40] and we're living in a time where it just
[1:42] seems as if
[1:43] we're not able to outrun the shadow of
[1:46] the pandemic we're not able to find
[1:48] um all the positive markers in the
[1:51] economy things are very confusing right
[1:53] now in the world whether it be markets
[1:56] or economies or social issues
[1:59] entertainment lord whatever it might be
[2:01] it's a very confusing time
[2:03] and where we find our strength lord is
[2:06] in the clarity of your word we ask
[2:08] father that we can just turn our eyes
[2:10] away from all the things that are
[2:12] messed up in laodicea and just look to
[2:14] you in this bright age for clarity for
[2:16] comfort and for strength we commit this
[2:18] time to you now father as you your
[2:20] presence has been felt we believe you've
[2:21] received our worship now father speak to
[2:24] us through your word we pray in jesus
[2:26] name amen
[2:27] you can be seated
[2:31] tonight i'm trusting that i'll be able
[2:33] to um kind of wrap up the foundation
[2:37] foundational thought on the subject of
[2:40] supreme faith revealed in abraham
[2:43] and
[2:44] what we've been looking at even from the
[2:46] very beginning even though we might not
[2:47] have expressed it in these terms is how
[2:50] that his faith is an example of
[2:51] rapturing faith
[2:53] and the very simple theme that i'm
[2:55] wanting to identify is how that his
[2:57] faith progressed
[2:59] through the routine of daily trusting
[3:01] god's
[3:03] god's word to him god's promises to him
[3:05] and so
[3:06] his his faith became strong and it
[3:08] increased by just taking god at his word
[3:10] day by day
[3:11] and though we just see his life over the
[3:14] span of several chapters
[3:16] and we have a lot of significant events
[3:18] that are recorded and visitations of god
[3:20] that are recorded there's a way that you
[3:22] can look into abraham's life and realize
[3:24] that he's living a life which is very
[3:26] much like the lives of
[3:29] families that would have been existing
[3:30] at the time but what made him different
[3:32] was this presence of god in his life in
[3:35] this following the supernatural promise
[3:37] and following this supernatural being
[3:40] and we're looking specifically how that
[3:42] his obedience in genesis chapter 22
[3:45] was his faith coming to his perfection
[3:48] and we've been identifying how the
[3:50] especially in that his faith is an
[3:51] example of rapture and faith is that his
[3:53] obedience was based on a revelation of
[3:56] god's character
[3:57] that he was not just merely
[3:59] obeying god because of the authority
[4:02] and i'm very careful in expressing this
[4:04] because i'm really wanting hoping that
[4:06] at this point realize we're looking at a
[4:08] matured time in abraham's life
[4:11] whereas he might have initially obeyed
[4:13] god because he recognized this to be
[4:15] something beyond him a supernatural
[4:17] being he begins to obey and you obey
[4:20] because of the authority but then
[4:22] through time you you should begin to
[4:24] understand what is in the heart of the
[4:26] one who has the authority what is in the
[4:27] heart of the one that is getting given
[4:29] me this command
[4:30] and so abraham wasn't just blindly
[4:33] following god but by the time he offers
[4:35] up his son upon the altar
[4:37] to sacrifice him he has a revelation of
[4:39] god's power and what he's able to do and
[4:42] abraham believed specifically he
[4:44] believed that god was able to resurrect
[4:46] isaac
[4:48] so he wasn't just going there saying
[4:49] well god told me to kill my son so i
[4:51] guess i'm just going to kill him he
[4:52] understood something about the nature of
[4:54] god's promises to him and the nature of
[4:57] god
[4:58] to there was this resurrection and this
[5:00] power over death that he had before him
[5:02] and he could go saying i've already
[5:04] written witnessed according to scripture
[5:06] we could say that abraham's testimony
[5:08] would have been i've already witnessed a
[5:10] resurrection in my own dead body
[5:12] i've already witnessed a resurrection in
[5:14] the dead womb of my wife sarah so
[5:17] and god said it's going to be through
[5:18] isaac that this seed is going to come
[5:20] and isaac without any progeny and isaac
[5:23] uh without any in those that would
[5:25] inherit his legacy he just knew
[5:27] according to the revelation that isaac
[5:30] would have to be resurrected that god
[5:32] was able to reckon that god would be
[5:33] able to raise him from the dead
[5:36] and what preceded abraham's walk up
[5:39] mount moriah this this climax this
[5:41] showdown of his faith was that god had
[5:44] been visiting him and making himself
[5:46] known and that's why jesus says in john
[5:48] chapter 8 that your father abraham
[5:50] rejoiced to see my day he
[5:52] had this
[5:53] longing expectation to see the time that
[5:55] the messiah would be revealed to his
[5:57] seed but then he says and he saw it and
[6:00] was glad
[6:01] so there's something about the
[6:02] experience of abraham that allowed him
[6:05] to actually see christ
[6:08] and see a manifestation in revelation of
[6:10] jesus christ and it caused him to
[6:12] rejoice it gave him excitement
[6:15] and we asked the question on sunday what
[6:16] did abraham see
[6:18] and jesus is going to say that um
[6:21] he he rejoiced to see my day and he saw
[6:23] it and was glad what did he see he saw
[6:25] melchizedek in genesis 14.
[6:27] uh he saw the lord come to him in the
[6:30] plains of memory there in the days of
[6:32] lot in genesis 18. and these are
[6:34] scriptures that we ought to be familiar
[6:36] with and i think we are very familiar
[6:38] with them
[6:39] and and we're going to be actually
[6:41] reading from a couple spots just very
[6:42] kind of
[6:43] kind of just going over um just on the
[6:45] surface level that the lord would lead
[6:47] us to go deeper i would absolutely love
[6:48] that but i just want to kind of cover
[6:50] just the tops of it
[6:52] here's the lord making himself known in
[6:54] genesis 14 in melchizedek then it's the
[6:56] lord appearing to him in genesis 18 in
[6:58] the days of lot there in the plains of
[7:00] memory and this is how jesus can look
[7:02] back and say abraham saw
[7:05] me he saw this manifestation of god
[7:08] and so in the sermon who is this
[7:09] melchizedek brother man says when
[7:11] abraham met him he was melchizedek
[7:14] and then he makes this statement and i
[7:16] think this statement is um
[7:19] kind of follows in the channel of maybe
[7:20] a dozen statements by now that we've
[7:22] read where brother said he's an example
[7:24] he was an example his life typifies
[7:26] something he says he unfolds here what
[7:29] all the attributes and you're an
[7:30] attribute of god right what all the
[7:32] attributes will do in the final day
[7:34] every son of abraham so every bride
[7:37] member
[7:38] can see what's going to be done unto
[7:40] them what will be hap but they'll see
[7:42] what they'll witness what they'll
[7:43] experience in the end it's unfolding in
[7:45] the life of abraham every son of faith
[7:48] will absolutely do the same thing he's
[7:50] going to have this experience to see
[7:52] this revelation but i want to watch how
[7:54] we have to come
[7:55] and so there's a process where he's
[7:57] saying this is what's going to happen
[7:59] and he's somehow we have to come and he
[8:01] even gets into and i wanted to use the
[8:02] statement tonight how he's looking at
[8:04] the life of abraham and he says we see
[8:06] here
[8:07] our journey
[8:09] and where we go when we die and we see
[8:11] our whole journey from election and
[8:13] predestination death burial resurrection
[8:15] it's all typified and seen in the life
[8:18] of abraham but he identifies it and
[8:20] points it out that we are going to be
[8:22] walking in this pattern of abraham in
[8:24] the end time
[8:25] and when we look at genesis chapter 18
[8:27] and i know this is review but even
[8:30] uh when i looked at a lot of the things
[8:32] i wanted to share tonight i'm finishing
[8:33] up what we didn't get to on sunday
[8:36] um the service just kind of went a
[8:37] direction
[8:38] well i didn't really finish what i had
[8:40] on my heart to finish so i'm kind of
[8:41] recapping some of these things and i
[8:43] appreciate just the welcoming spirit to
[8:45] be able to do this
[8:46] uh but in genesis chapter 18 verse 14.
[8:49] the question is asked the lord appears
[8:51] unto abraham and he says is there
[8:52] anything too hard for the lord
[8:55] that gives us comfort in a time of
[8:56] trouble the day that we're living in now
[8:57] when everything seems to be absolutely
[8:59] impossible and it's very difficult for
[9:01] us to believe for small things and minor
[9:03] things and just simple things let alone
[9:05] a body change he says is anything too
[9:07] hard for the lord he says at the time
[9:09] appointed i will return to thee
[9:12] according to the time of life and sarah
[9:13] shall have a son
[9:15] and here's the promise of visitation of
[9:16] the lord he's
[9:18] making himself known to abraham and he
[9:20] says that according to the time of life
[9:21] and an appointed time a time for
[9:24] resurrection
[9:25] a time for change a time for the
[9:27] deadness of abraham's body to be
[9:29] overcome a time for the deadness of
[9:30] sarah's womb to be revived i'm going to
[9:32] come when deadness is conquered and the
[9:34] promise that i've made to you is going
[9:36] to be fulfilled i'm going to visit you
[9:38] and i'm going to see this promise
[9:39] through
[9:40] and so in these statements that we've
[9:42] been looking at in the from the message
[9:44] of the hour and the pattern of the
[9:45] scripture or the statements in scripture
[9:47] we're looking at how the abraham's life
[9:49] has a pattern of the rapture of the
[9:51] bride it holds this pattern we can begin
[9:54] to look
[9:55] and i'll say this now because i've been
[9:57] kind of looking at it that when i say it
[9:58] holds the pattern
[10:00] i i
[10:01] we don't want to get very just try to
[10:03] type everything out say oh well then
[10:04] when god said abram that's when i came
[10:06] to the message and then when i moved
[10:08] then when i did went over here when i
[10:10] was in this church i was i was kind of
[10:12] there still with my father and my
[10:14] brother uh in this other in in on and
[10:17] and then when i separated from that and
[10:19] i went into this other church and there
[10:20] i was in the promised land but then i
[10:22] got mixed up in this and i had to
[10:23] separate from my nephew and and try to
[10:25] just walk it all out chronologically
[10:27] it's not going to work right and i think
[10:29] sometimes when we do that we find we
[10:31] justify why we find ourselves in babylon
[10:33] we say well abraham went to egypt and
[10:36] and so we're not trying to strictly
[10:38] unfold it chronologically but what we
[10:40] see is different things manifest in the
[10:42] life of abraham not necessarily
[10:44] chronologically but different things are
[10:46] manifest and even with the change of his
[10:48] name being a type of adoption and we see
[10:50] these different things happening and and
[10:52] we can pull these things out from
[10:53] different vantage points and perspective
[10:56] and see that it's a mosaic of the way
[10:58] that god deals with his children and it
[11:00] can actually be placed in an order for
[11:02] us where we are today but we're not just
[11:04] trying to say from day one to the end of
[11:06] his life we're all following the same
[11:08] pattern but there's glimpses and types
[11:10] and ways that god dealt with abraham
[11:12] that we see unfolding for us and so this
[11:15] is a
[11:16] hit we see a pattern of the rapture in
[11:18] the life of abraham and so tonight i'm
[11:20] just kind of tying up some loose ends
[11:22] and hoping to finalize um the foundation
[11:25] on this we're saying supreme faith
[11:27] revealed in abraham
[11:28] the supreme faith is rapturing faith and
[11:30] he's an example of our faith in the end
[11:32] time in this that faith is specifically
[11:35] a rapturing faith because we've got to
[11:37] have that kind of faith in this end time
[11:40] that's what's required and it being
[11:42] required we're looking at how that's
[11:44] kind of looking at the life of
[11:45] everything in the life of abraham these
[11:47] events in genesis chapter 22 express
[11:50] a type of the bride's rapturing faith
[11:52] but what my desire to do and it might
[11:54] just be a couple services where we do it
[11:56] is look at abraham more from the human
[11:58] perspective and the things that he went
[12:00] through and identify how this faith
[12:02] increased
[12:03] and i want to read one more statement
[12:05] before we step forward in this brother
[12:06] bram says our bodies will have to be
[12:08] changed as we're looking as life is a
[12:10] pattern of the rapture
[12:12] our bodies will have to be changed we
[12:14] just can't turn back to young men and
[12:15] women we've got to have a different kind
[12:18] of body so you can be caught in the air
[12:20] to receive the promised son brother
[12:22] branham revisits the same issue i
[12:23] believe in true easter seal
[12:25] and touches on it in another place to
[12:27] where he's saying that it's not just a
[12:29] matter of all of us all of us sudden us
[12:31] just kind of being young again but
[12:33] they're actually we need something else
[12:34] something has to take place so this body
[12:37] has to be changed so you can be caught
[12:39] in the air to receive the promised son
[12:41] that's what the church is waiting for
[12:43] now the true church
[12:45] so what we're waiting for now is the
[12:47] change of our bodies there's got to be
[12:48] some
[12:49] faith come because think about it this
[12:51] way rapturing faith is faith to what
[12:52] brother taught us faith to change your
[12:55] body you'll have to have power to change
[12:57] your body
[12:58] then we meet the lord in the air
[13:01] so when you recognize this pattern in
[13:02] this order
[13:04] it's and i don't want you to be uh
[13:07] uh
[13:09] be very strict in your thought process
[13:11] to catch what i'm trying to say
[13:12] that we're not
[13:14] we we don't have a faith just waiting
[13:16] for the lord to come
[13:18] in this and what we might call the
[13:20] second coming and then jesus is coming
[13:22] and we see jesus coming and that kind of
[13:24] and even especially i'm referring to
[13:26] maybe more denominational idea of what
[13:27] the coming of the lord will be like and
[13:29] then that's going to instigate rapturing
[13:30] faith when we see the lord in the air
[13:33] and it's going to kind of instigate this
[13:34] faith to change our bodies when you see
[13:36] the order as we are taught it in the
[13:38] word of god there has to come a faith
[13:40] for our bodies to be changed then we go
[13:42] to meet the lord in the air
[13:44] and so he's saying this is what the
[13:46] church is waiting for so there has to be
[13:47] something come to produce the faith for
[13:49] the change but then he says every
[13:51] manifestation what he did to abraham
[13:53] he's done to his seat after him leaving
[13:56] one thing out that's the rapture of the
[13:57] church
[13:58] now statement like that kind of includes
[14:00] the way that he revealed himself to the
[14:02] natural seed of abraham in the days of
[14:04] the messiah when he revealed himself in
[14:06] flesh to to his the seed of abraham and
[14:09] he's just saying that how god manifested
[14:11] himself to abraham he does to the seed
[14:14] of abraham and so what he does to
[14:16] abraham he does to the seed of abraham
[14:18] and we as the royal seed of abraham have
[14:20] a promise to us and then he says leaving
[14:22] one thing out one thing has not happened
[14:24] he says the rapture of the church this
[14:26] is this climax and the summation of the
[14:28] ages
[14:29] and so he when he says every
[14:31] manifestation what he did to abraham
[14:33] he's done every manifestation
[14:35] there are specific promises
[14:37] and i feel very comfortable that this
[14:39] falls on a wednesday night because
[14:40] you're you know these things being in
[14:42] message yourselves there's certain
[14:44] manifestations that are promised to the
[14:47] royal seed
[14:49] certain prophecies in the scripture that
[14:51] we believe to be very dear to our hearts
[14:52] things that we've recognized things that
[14:54] have been manifested to us things that
[14:55] we desire that would still be recognized
[14:57] by others
[14:59] things things that people need to grasp
[15:01] and they need to kept catch a true
[15:02] revelation of these things but they're
[15:04] specific promises of a manifestation of
[15:06] god to the royal seed and this is what
[15:08] he's referring to
[15:10] and so there's a promised revealing
[15:12] reveal unto the son of man there's a
[15:13] promise unfolding even if you want to
[15:15] say a promise to visitation uh before
[15:18] the meeting in the air before our bodies
[15:20] are changed
[15:21] and in genesis chapter 14 i read from
[15:23] genesis chapter 14 hebrews 7 and also
[15:26] genesis 18. when he says every
[15:28] manifestation i just want to quickly
[15:30] look at these manifestations of god to
[15:32] abraham and realize that in some way we
[15:35] need to have these same type of
[15:37] revelations
[15:38] and he says in genesis chapter 14 verses
[15:40] 17 to 19.
[15:42] i'm just going to skip over kind of the
[15:44] background for it but abraham takes 318
[15:46] servants and he goes out and defeats
[15:48] five kings
[15:49] uh
[15:50] quite a pretty good group of uh a
[15:52] servants um and he's returning from the
[15:55] slaughter of the kings he's returning
[15:56] from this great uh battle this great
[15:58] victory of rescuing lot and the king of
[16:00] sodom which is the king of burning went
[16:02] out to meet him after his return from
[16:04] the slaughter uh kerala dalmar
[16:07] and he says and the kings that were with
[16:09] him at the valle chavez which is the
[16:11] kings dale and melchizedek king of salem
[16:14] now this is not the king of sodom but
[16:16] the king of salem melchizedek king of
[16:18] salem brought forth bread and wine here
[16:21] the king of salem
[16:22] is serving him
[16:24] communion
[16:25] the man talks about how this is a type
[16:26] of how after the battle we'll sit down
[16:28] with him
[16:29] in the wedding supper he'll service
[16:31] melchizedek king of salem brought forth
[16:32] bread and wine and he was the priest of
[16:34] the most high god and he blessed him and
[16:37] said blessed be abraham of the most high
[16:39] god possessor of heaven and earth
[16:43] and so here is melchizedek king of salem
[16:46] and let's just read quickly hebrews
[16:48] chapter 7 verses 1 to 2 just to see how
[16:51] paul comes back to it and visits who
[16:52] this melchizedek king of salem is for
[16:55] this melchizedek king of salem priest of
[16:57] the most high god who met abraham
[16:59] returning from the slaughter of the
[17:01] kings and blessed him to whom also
[17:03] abraham gave a tenth part of all first
[17:05] being by interpretation king of
[17:08] righteousness and after that also king
[17:10] of salem which is king of peace
[17:13] so who is this melchizedek who is it
[17:16] that abraham meets in genesis chapter 14
[17:18] this melchizedek king of salem it wasn't
[17:20] there what jerusalem didn't exist at
[17:22] this time and it's this uh very striking
[17:25] figure that abraham meets and he's
[17:26] blessed he's the priest of the most high
[17:28] god this is before any kind of
[17:30] priesthood has been instituted
[17:32] and he says that and we're taught that
[17:33] jesus christ paul teaching that jesus
[17:35] christ was made a high priest after the
[17:37] order of melchizedek and so who is this
[17:40] melchizedek it's the lord
[17:42] this melchizedek is it's the lord it's
[17:44] god himself this is who abraham meets
[17:46] after this slaughter and he has it's
[17:49] characterized and described in this
[17:51] interaction but here melchizedek king of
[17:54] salem comes and makes himself known to
[17:56] abraham and he blesses him and abraham's
[17:58] giving tithing he's giving a tenth part
[18:00] of all um to him instead of him taking
[18:03] what the king of sodom wanted to offer
[18:05] here's abram giving a tenth part to the
[18:07] king
[18:08] king of salem melchizedek and then he's
[18:10] described also as the priest of the most
[18:12] high god king and priest who is this
[18:15] it's the lord it's god himself
[18:17] and he makes this appearance to abraham
[18:20] then in genesis chapter 18 verse 1
[18:23] and it says and the lord appeared to him
[18:26] in the plains of mammary
[18:29] the lord appeared to him in the plains
[18:30] of memory i'm just
[18:32] using this first part of this verse
[18:34] in verse 3 abraham sees him and says my
[18:37] lord he's calling him adonai he calls
[18:39] him lord
[18:40] and it's the lord that makes himself
[18:42] known in genesis chapter 14
[18:44] and now it's the lord that's making
[18:46] himself known clearly evidently we would
[18:48] believe that genesis chapter 14 is god
[18:50] himself in some form manifest himself to
[18:53] abraham now in genesis 18 it's the lord
[18:56] it says the lord appears to him and he's
[18:57] making this appearance in flesh to
[18:59] abraham and this is why the language is
[19:02] used and and these two
[19:04] uh
[19:05] appearances are kind of combined
[19:06] together to refer to melchizedek because
[19:09] this is a name he's not given a name
[19:11] here in genesis 18 but he was given a
[19:13] name in genesis 14. so we say when we
[19:15] talk about melchizedek he's not called
[19:17] melchizedek in genesis 18 but it's the
[19:19] same god
[19:21] appearing the form of god making himself
[19:23] known to abraham and in this one in
[19:26] genesis 18 he's specifically opening up
[19:29] something to abraham and saying this
[19:31] blessing that i'm going to give you and
[19:33] this blessed be abraham of the most high
[19:36] god this god who possesses heaven and
[19:38] earth he's now saying he's now going to
[19:39] get very detailed and very specific in
[19:42] genesis 18. and so it's unfolded these
[19:45] promises are given promises are given
[19:46] and now it's coming right down to where
[19:49] sarah is going to have a son and i'm
[19:51] going to visit you according to the time
[19:53] of life this specific time it's coming
[19:54] very soon it's very imminent and as you
[19:57] continue to read you'll see that the two
[19:59] other angels that came with this angel
[20:01] go down into sodom but it it's clear in
[20:04] the scripture that the lord stays with
[20:06] abraham
[20:07] why sodom is being dealt with why
[20:08] judgment is coming the lord stays back
[20:11] with abraham and discloses things to him
[20:13] that the other two angels didn't didn't
[20:15] have a message for and discloses things
[20:17] to abraham and it signifies this
[20:19] tremendous type of the bride at the end
[20:21] time who's gathered under a message and
[20:23] things are being disclosed to her and
[20:25] revelations are being made known to her
[20:26] at a time of soon coming judgment
[20:30] and so melchizedek makes himself known
[20:32] to abraham in genesis 14 it's the same
[20:34] god in flesh
[20:36] making himself known in genesis 18.
[20:38] and when brother brown is preaching who
[20:40] is this melchizedek
[20:41] he says praise god for these opening
[20:43] seals
[20:44] is my prayer and
[20:46] i will say these are my words
[20:48] praise god for the opening of the seals
[20:52] he's not saying praise god for something
[20:54] future for the seals being open and he
[20:56] said for all seven seals are open and
[20:58] all things are ready for those who can
[20:59] receive it and we receive it he said for
[21:01] these opening seals is my prayer to know
[21:03] these things praise god for the seals
[21:05] being opened to know these things he's
[21:07] talking about melchizedek he says now
[21:08] the true revelation of melchizedek comes
[21:11] into view
[21:12] so now at the opening of the word there
[21:14] is a true revelation of melchizedek that
[21:17] comes into view remember how paul when
[21:19] he's teaching on melchizedek says hey
[21:20] there's a lot of things i want to say
[21:21] about melchizedek he says but i can't
[21:23] say them now seems you become dull of
[21:25] hearing and have need to be taught again
[21:26] what be the the foundational truths
[21:28] again and so paul wanted to bring out
[21:31] more melchizedek but it's withheld at
[21:33] that time but now in the end time the
[21:36] gentile bride the christians in this
[21:38] last day have the privilege of once
[21:40] again the true revelation of melchizedek
[21:43] coming into view
[21:44] he's made flesh before abraham in the
[21:46] book of genesis he's made flesh before
[21:49] the children of israel in the days of
[21:51] jesus christ and then in the end time
[21:53] there's another manifestation of god in
[21:56] flesh in the stream of human beings in
[21:58] the lives of his people with by
[22:00] revelation which is bringing forth
[22:03] another manifestation of god
[22:05] if god he says the true revelation of
[22:08] melchizedek is coming into view once
[22:09] again at the open of the word and so god
[22:12] making himself known to the royal seed
[22:14] of abraham
[22:16] what is he doing in this time he's
[22:18] confirming a promise that he had made to
[22:20] the elect
[22:21] a
[22:22] covenant think of a covenant he's going
[22:23] to recognize the covenant recognize the
[22:26] promise he made this promise to abraham
[22:28] he makes this vision to abraham to
[22:29] confirm it and say i'm with you and i'm
[22:31] staying with you until this is fulfilled
[22:33] it's going to happen i'm going to bring
[22:35] it to pass because this is a covenant
[22:36] and a promise i made to you
[22:38] at the beginning when i called you and
[22:40] here i am at the end i'm gonna i'm gonna
[22:43] see this promise through i'm gonna make
[22:44] this promise firm i will perform what i
[22:47] promised to you
[22:49] and brother branham is making this this
[22:51] statement
[22:52] and i'm not uh finding a feather and
[22:54] building a chicken
[22:56] but
[22:56] the statement he makes here may seem so
[22:58] slight and so small but this is what's
[23:00] happened at the open of the seals this
[23:02] is what the revelation of jesus christ
[23:03] is all about
[23:05] is god making himself known to his
[23:07] people to confirm his promise and to
[23:08] fulfill it
[23:10] and so it's to bring
[23:13] to bring forth
[23:14] the supreme faith
[23:16] in the bride that's what these things
[23:18] are for the open of the word they open
[23:19] the seals
[23:20] and i
[23:22] uh maybe in my mind i'm thinking i would
[23:24] save this for later but
[23:26] again i just need to inject this
[23:29] don't get weird
[23:32] right
[23:34] oh the opening of the word the seven
[23:35] seals the seven thunders
[23:38] it it is really awesome right i mean
[23:41] this mount zion showdown is amazing
[23:43] seven thunder seven seals and third pull
[23:46] and all these things but it's very very
[23:48] practical right when you start to catch
[23:50] the revelation of it and so these
[23:52] manifestations of god the openly seals
[23:54] the revelation of jesus christ the
[23:56] reveal of the son of man the coming lord
[23:57] how whatever language you need to use
[23:59] whatever scriptures you identify as
[24:00] being fulfilled they have a practical
[24:03] outworking in your life just like it did
[24:04] in abraham's
[24:06] just like we read about abraham and it's
[24:07] not abraham musing over and over again
[24:10] sharing with you these deep things in
[24:11] genesis 12 to genesis 25 is abraham just
[24:14] telling you all these wild types he came
[24:16] up with right tell him oh did you know
[24:18] that noah had this and this happened and
[24:20] he's just rearranging the events of the
[24:22] first
[24:23] 11 books of the bible and wow in your
[24:25] minds with the knowledge he has about
[24:26] all the numerology in the garden of eden
[24:28] it had a practical outworking in
[24:30] abraham's life it's going to do the same
[24:31] for us
[24:33] so just as these manifestations brought
[24:36] forth supreme faith and abraham it's to
[24:37] do it for us now to the point on the
[24:39] open of the seven seals notice what
[24:41] brother brahm says in the first seal it
[24:43] says at the end of the pentecostal age
[24:45] what is the pentecostal age
[24:50] micah can you play the jeopardy theme in
[24:52] g for me
[24:53] the pentecostal age is the laodicean age
[24:57] but the man made him one in the same
[24:58] it's important to recognize that the
[24:59] pentecostal age at the end of the
[25:01] pentecostal age we're supposed to
[25:02] receive according to the word as god
[25:04] help me tonight to show you through here
[25:06] that we're to receive a messenger
[25:07] that'll take all those loose ends out
[25:09] there and reveal the whole secret of god
[25:12] for
[25:13] the rapturing of the church
[25:15] so there's a there's a revelation that
[25:17] comes forth and it's for the specific
[25:18] purpose of rapture in the church and
[25:20] there's coming forth seven mysterious
[25:22] thunders that's not even written at all
[25:23] that's right and i believe
[25:25] that through those seven thunders will
[25:26] be revealed in the last days in order to
[25:29] get the bride together for
[25:31] rapturing faith i'm reading this not so
[25:33] much to identify
[25:35] when this came at the end of the layout
[25:37] of the scene age or what messenger this
[25:39] was which we know who it was
[25:41] and and and what the whole secret was
[25:43] the seven mysterious thunders i'm
[25:45] wanting just to identify the purpose is
[25:47] the rapture
[25:49] he says because what we got right now we
[25:51] wouldn't be able to do it
[25:52] the faith we have right now is saying
[25:54] where the church is at it's going to
[25:56] need something else something else is
[25:58] going to have to happen and if we can
[26:00] think about abraham god gave him the
[26:01] promise he's obeying god he's obeying
[26:03] god but whenever whenever abraham had a
[26:06] need to go a step further in the
[26:07] promises of god god was there to speak
[26:10] to him and give him an experience and
[26:12] give him an encouragement and take him a
[26:13] step further your abram your abram your
[26:15] abram then he changes his name
[26:18] he's like no you are going to be a
[26:19] father of many nations i'm going to
[26:20] change your name he said i'm going to
[26:21] give you i'm going to give you a son i'm
[26:22] going to give you a sentence then he
[26:23] comes around he says no i'm not going to
[26:24] give you any sense it's going to be
[26:25] through sarah his name's going to be
[26:26] isaac things got more precise and he's
[26:28] visiting he's given him in the time when
[26:30] something had to happen something had to
[26:32] happen he's there for him
[26:34] so he says we don't have what we need
[26:36] right now because there's something
[26:37] we've got to take a step further
[26:39] remember the foundational quote we're
[26:40] using in balm and gilead we need to step
[26:43] into the supreme faith
[26:45] he says to do that we have to perfectly
[26:46] know what we're doing he says we got to
[26:47] move up to supreme faith and it's the
[26:49] same language here we've got to have a
[26:51] it says we can't there's something we've
[26:53] got to step farther we can't have enough
[26:55] faith for divine healing hardly
[26:57] what i'm kind of sewing some see
[26:59] breadcrumbs out there some seeds out
[27:01] there so you know what my mind where my
[27:02] heart has been what is divine healing
[27:04] the type of
[27:05] the resurrection
[27:07] says we got to have enough faith to be
[27:09] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[27:11] of this earth
[27:12] we have to have that we'll have to have
[27:14] power to change our bodies listen we are
[27:16] not waiting i don't think this is
[27:18] controversial and trust that it's not we
[27:20] are not holding on hoping that kova
[27:22] doesn't get us until the time that
[27:23] brother branham can come back and speak
[27:25] to us new bodies
[27:28] brother braham didn't teach it
[27:30] it's not what we're waiting for
[27:32] i believe that you as individual members
[27:34] of this bride through your relationship
[27:36] with jesus christ are going to receive
[27:38] the faith that you need
[27:40] not only to change your bodies but to
[27:42] make it day by day
[27:44] because you as the bride of jesus christ
[27:46] not me as the pastor you as the british
[27:48] christ have been given power to bind the
[27:50] greatest to the least
[27:52] you really just need to have your faith
[27:53] loose to exercise it
[27:56] got to have enough faith to be changed
[27:57] in a moment he says well fine after a
[27:58] while lord willing where it is written
[28:01] then all the judgments of these
[28:02] evildoers says now see down to the ages
[28:04] these seals have been breaking until now
[28:06] the last seal is broken
[28:09] the events hid under these seals
[28:10] unfolded through all these ages now in
[28:12] the end he says the last seal is broken
[28:16] and as things are being made known and i
[28:18] and i i recognize immediately
[28:20] uh where there are certain things that
[28:22] people might find difficult to accept
[28:25] but brother ma'am is identifying things
[28:27] that are related to the seven seals
[28:29] being opened
[28:30] and he's saying these things are very
[28:31] relevant to the time we're living in for
[28:33] the purpose of a rapture again he says
[28:34] in the first seal
[28:36] he's referring to revelations chapter 10
[28:38] the mystery of the seven thunders this
[28:40] uh angel coming down covenant angel
[28:43] coming down with the book open
[28:44] and he's talking about these mysterious
[28:46] thunders he says we don't know what they
[28:47] are yet
[28:48] but my opinion they'll be revealed right
[28:50] away
[28:52] and when it does it'll give faith for
[28:54] that rapturing grace for that church to
[28:56] move out again i'm reading these
[28:58] statements to identify how that brother
[29:00] branham is pointing out a revealing a
[29:03] manifesting a fulfillment of god's
[29:05] promise that's written in his word and
[29:07] the the direct result of this
[29:10] manifestation this revealing the
[29:11] scriptural promise being fulfilled is it
[29:13] produces rapturing faith in you
[29:16] and he's identified coming back to it
[29:17] over and over again rapturing grace to
[29:19] move out we just moved through
[29:20] everything that we know of through all
[29:21] the dispensations we've watched
[29:23] everything we've seen the mysteries of
[29:24] god we've seen the great gathering
[29:26] together the bride in the last days but
[29:27] yet there's something in there that we
[29:29] just can't lighten ourselves with
[29:31] there's something another there's got to
[29:33] be something a step further as he says
[29:34] earlier but imagine when the mysterious
[29:37] when the mysteries begin to come forth
[29:39] god said hold it back now wait a minute
[29:41] revelations chapter 10 it'll reveal in
[29:43] that day don't write it at all john
[29:44] because they'll stagger over it just let
[29:46] it go but i'll reveal it in that day
[29:48] when it has need to be done
[29:51] when they need it
[29:53] he said well why did they make these
[29:54] things no men they didn't need it
[29:56] why didn't they make it known then they
[29:58] didn't need it why does he make it known
[29:59] now
[30:00] we need it
[30:01] that's why it's made known now and this
[30:03] happened in abraham's life as we
[30:05] mentioned a moment ago whenever he
[30:06] needed an extra uh shot of faith
[30:10] whenever he needed another unction a
[30:12] reminder another encouragement something
[30:14] to hold on to and he's staggering not
[30:16] through unbelief but as he makes it
[30:18] through his daily life and things happen
[30:20] and things transpire and he needs
[30:22] something from god god gives him a
[30:24] revelation god revealed himself to
[30:27] abraham when he needed it
[30:30] we find the king of salem the priest of
[30:32] the most high god coming to abraham
[30:34] after the slaughter of the kings in a
[30:36] moment to commune with him and to
[30:38] encourage him and it's because of that
[30:40] visitation and the other visitations
[30:42] that intervene that abraham we find
[30:44] abraham in genesis 18 readily
[30:47] identifying the lord and welcoming him
[30:49] to commune with him in his tent
[30:51] there outside his tent with sarah on the
[30:53] inside these are visitations of god
[30:55] growing abraham's faith in the time that
[30:58] he needs it
[31:00] and abraham's life and his faith testify
[31:03] of the bride's supreme faith for a
[31:05] rapture
[31:07] and how they when abraham needed it god
[31:10] made himself known
[31:11] and
[31:14] maybe when i
[31:15] when i'm when i'm putting these
[31:17] statements together it makes perfect
[31:18] sense then i say it i'm like well there
[31:20] might be a huge hole missing for them i
[31:21] don't know
[31:23] but i'm reading these things from the
[31:25] first seal to identify and there's many
[31:27] many more statements we can read how
[31:28] that those events transpired ultimately
[31:31] for rapturing faith
[31:33] that's the ultimate it's ultimately what
[31:35] it's for so we're not feeding on these
[31:37] things to become more churchy become
[31:40] more religious
[31:41] uh to be more organized to be more
[31:43] succinct in our doctrine to be more
[31:45] doctrinally uh um precise and uh there's
[31:49] just there's a lot of things that we
[31:50] could do that that more promote
[31:52] organization and cohesiveness of beliefs
[31:55] when what these things were for is that
[31:58] if there's just one person just one
[32:00] that's going to go in a body going a
[32:02] rapture that's what it was for
[32:04] and i believe that our churches exist
[32:06] for the purpose of facilitating rapture
[32:08] and faith in individual members
[32:10] that's what we exist for we exist to
[32:12] facilitate rapturing faith in your heart
[32:14] and in your lives so that you can you
[32:16] can be at that meeting in the air and
[32:18] abraham's life is such a beautiful story
[32:20] of how he comes to this expression of
[32:22] faith in genesis 22 which is a type of
[32:24] the bride's supreme faith for rapture
[32:27] this rapturing grace to move out the
[32:29] power to change our bodies it's
[32:30] represented in abraham and he got to
[32:32] genesis 22 through a process
[32:36] abraham's faith began in an election
[32:40] god chose them
[32:42] i think we said it sunday god chose them
[32:44] out of multitudes of people i don't know
[32:46] how many millions would have been on the
[32:47] face of you but god in the sea of
[32:49] everyone just said abram
[32:52] and that's where it began
[32:54] and that's where ours begins
[32:56] there's a grace on a lot of us that we
[32:58] were actually born into what we call the
[32:59] message we're born into it that's a
[33:01] that's an extreme grace that's wonderful
[33:03] it's a tremendous opportunity i'm
[33:04] grateful that my children have that
[33:06] opportunity to be born in a home uh that
[33:09] honors the word of god and has a desire
[33:10] to serve god in the in the light of the
[33:12] truth in this hour and i was privileged
[33:14] to be born in a home with first
[33:15] generation message parents and raised in
[33:17] that truth and and to have the the truth
[33:20] expressed to us from from the word of
[33:21] god in this hour that's a tremendous
[33:23] grace but it still all begins with god
[33:26] calling your name
[33:28] by election
[33:30] some of us didn't have that privilege to
[33:31] be raised in church let alone in a
[33:33] message church or in a family that
[33:35] believes the word of the end time but
[33:36] still it's god's grace god called your
[33:39] name god called you out god identified
[33:41] himself and called you and it began the
[33:43] same way out of tunes
[33:46] here you are there's a lot of other
[33:47] people around you but somehow someway
[33:49] god calls your name and that's where his
[33:52] faith began
[33:53] and then it grew as god revealed himself
[33:56] to abraham
[33:58] it begins an election then it grows
[34:00] through revelation and the revelations
[34:02] were manifesting the character of god to
[34:05] abraham and he was learning to trust
[34:07] this one more and more and more he was
[34:09] learning something about his promises to
[34:11] him he was learning something about the
[34:13] impact and the and the implications of
[34:15] those promises and it was a it was
[34:17] something beautiful that unfolds in the
[34:18] life of abraham we should not make it so
[34:20] sterile towards his god called abraham
[34:22] told him to do this abraham just obeyed
[34:24] and this is what it resulted in but it
[34:26] was a life lived with god a walking with
[34:28] god it was something that unfolded with
[34:31] him and his faith increased and he gets
[34:33] to a mount moriah experience over
[34:35] decades of walking with god
[34:38] and brother branham involvement gail he
[34:40] had when he's talking about coming to
[34:42] the supreme faith i'm using this to kind
[34:44] of sum up our foundation in this after
[34:46] you've trusted in him and watched him do
[34:48] so many things until it becomes just
[34:51] like a regular routine
[34:53] remember the acts of faith
[34:55] you tell me tonight you're going to go
[34:56] home that's an act of faith
[34:58] you tell me you're going to meet
[34:59] somebody tomorrow for lunch that's an
[35:00] act of faith these little repetitive
[35:03] everyday acts of faith
[35:06] brought abraham to supreme faith
[35:09] he says that's the condition i think the
[35:10] church will be in just before the coming
[35:12] of the lord
[35:13] after you've trusted him watch him do so
[35:15] many things
[35:17] you're now in the routine of trusting
[35:19] him
[35:20] you're in the routine of following him
[35:22] not on the routine of once a year or
[35:23] during special meetings trying to get
[35:24] your life right with god but in the
[35:26] routine of trusting him in the routine
[35:28] of follow him and he says so the rapture
[35:30] will just go right on that way
[35:32] i mean he has placed the rapture
[35:35] in the language of regular routine
[35:39] and think about that
[35:40] the rapture is going to be a regular
[35:42] routine
[35:43] the rapture's a revelation so if you're
[35:45] in the regular routine of receiving
[35:47] revelation it's pretty good iller
[35:48] iteration that's coming on here if
[35:50] you're in the regular routine of
[35:52] receiving revelation one day in the
[35:53] regular routine of receiving revelation
[35:55] you're going to receive the rapture of
[35:56] the revelation
[35:57] right
[36:01] that that's that's the order
[36:03] and he says the rapture is going to be
[36:04] the same way so there is a i wanted to
[36:07] do two things
[36:09] number one
[36:10] keep us from being stagnant
[36:12] right he's kind of waiting around you
[36:14] know hoping for some climactic event to
[36:15] take place we realize okay we've been
[36:17] given enough that god's done something
[36:19] in my life and this is real
[36:20] and i want to sir i want to
[36:22] enrich my experience with christ i want
[36:24] to be more real and more living and more
[36:26] abundant i want to be thriving in my
[36:28] relationship with the lord and i want
[36:29] the scriptures to be alive to me and i
[36:30] want the message to be unfolding to me
[36:32] on a daily basis and i want to believe
[36:34] god in small things and i want to look
[36:36] at these acts of faith in my family life
[36:38] in my work life and my professional life
[36:40] in school and all these different touch
[36:42] points where god can be a part be a part
[36:44] of your life and doing things in your
[36:45] life and then it becomes this regular
[36:47] routine of god making himself known to
[36:48] you and in fulfilling his word and so
[36:50] many things happen so one day the
[36:52] regular routine results in a rapture
[36:55] and that's what happens when you you get
[36:57] out of this we're just going to have
[36:58] church until the rapture comes no we're
[37:01] going to have church uh because we're in
[37:03] a rapture and it's going to be moments
[37:05] like this that's reminding you keep
[37:06] doing what you're doing and keep
[37:08] striving and keep pressing and go out
[37:10] there and find the lost sheep here in
[37:11] maricopa somewhere because we want to
[37:13] get out of here
[37:15] finding myself more and more responding
[37:16] to things that my wife mentions just
[37:18] saying even so
[37:20] come lord jesus come like let's just
[37:22] meet the lord let's get out of here
[37:24] well i don't want to wait to see how
[37:25] these things are going to fall out i
[37:27] want to get out of here so this is the
[37:28] urgency he says so the rapture will go
[37:30] on that way it'll just be a regular
[37:32] routine of following the scriptures and
[37:34] the plans of god
[37:38] that's what the rapture is going to be a
[37:39] regular routine of following the
[37:41] scriptures in the plans of god let's get
[37:43] into the regular routine
[37:45] of god revealing himself to us
[37:48] because our rapturing faith will arise
[37:50] it'll raise up within us by simply
[37:52] believing and obeying
[37:55] it's in the simplicity of god hiding
[37:57] himself in simplicity we're gonna have
[37:58] to hear the word believe the word and
[38:00] obey the word
[38:02] you have to act on it and it's in that
[38:06] that in hearing the word of god and and
[38:08] i'm i mean this
[38:10] when i'm talking about the revelation of
[38:11] the seven thunders
[38:13] i mean this is talking about the
[38:14] revealing of the son of man i mean this
[38:15] is not the lord himself shall descend
[38:16] from heaven with with the shout i this
[38:19] those are the things i'm thinking about
[38:20] when i say this that we hear the word we
[38:22] believe it and we obey the word and
[38:24] these things are transpiring to have a
[38:26] practical outwork in our lives so as i
[38:28] mentioned before don't try to be weird
[38:29] with this
[38:31] don't try to make yourself out to be
[38:32] some kind of mysterious uh character or
[38:35] something to be uh ultra uh ultra
[38:38] religious and mysterious and and
[38:40] fanatical deep things when they don't
[38:42] have any practical outworking in your
[38:44] life
[38:45] two statements i want to read very
[38:46] quickly
[38:48] and how that uh and i'd love to expand
[38:50] upon this in greater detail in the
[38:52] future brother branham says in the
[38:53] seventh seal he's talking how the
[38:54] seventh seal is revealed in these
[38:56] different parts and there's one part
[38:57] that's kind of being withheld he says it
[38:59] will be revealed in that day
[39:01] in the hour that it's supposed to be
[39:03] revealed in
[39:04] so he said it's going to be revealed it
[39:06] says so the thing for us to do is to be
[39:08] reverent before god and serve him and do
[39:10] all that we know how to do and live good
[39:12] christian lives now there's some who
[39:15] take this
[39:16] this very statement to say oh then
[39:18] forget about what's going to be revealed
[39:19] i just want to be a simple christian
[39:20] that's not what he's saying
[39:22] it's going to be revealed when it needs
[39:23] to be revealed and the thing what we
[39:25] need to do in light of the revelation
[39:27] that's coming or has come we should do
[39:29] all that we know to do to serve him and
[39:31] live good christian lives the revelation
[39:33] of the seven seals did not exempt us
[39:35] from living good christian lives as a
[39:37] matter of fact it's the one thing that
[39:39] allow us to truly live good christian
[39:41] lives not just be a mimic not just be an
[39:43] impersonator not just kind of put on the
[39:45] front of the pretense of a message
[39:46] believer but actually live a good
[39:49] christian life
[39:51] visit it that morning on question and
[39:52] answers on the seals now take my advice
[39:54] as your brother don't put your
[39:56] interpretation to anything your own
[39:58] interpretation anything you just go on
[40:00] and live a good christian life
[40:02] because you'll only wind yourself away
[40:05] from the real thing when you do it
[40:07] when you try to be odd you try to be
[40:09] different and you try to do this and you
[40:10] try to do that try to be mysterious he
[40:12] says you wind yourself away from the
[40:14] real thing when you do it why because
[40:16] the real revelation of this will
[40:18] actually make you a good christian
[40:21] it actually has this outworking in your
[40:22] life where it moderates your behavior as
[40:24] a man it moderates your behavior as a
[40:26] woman it puts you in your place as a
[40:27] husband to put you in a place as a
[40:29] father put you in your place as a wife
[40:31] and as a mother these are the things
[40:32] that actually come to bear upon your
[40:34] character because you're learning the
[40:36] character and nature of god more and
[40:37] more and more for these things being
[40:39] revealed or not to make us top heavy
[40:41] where we know so much more about the
[40:43] word than all these little pentecostal
[40:44] pennies running around everywhere but we
[40:46] have something that enlarges our hearts
[40:49] and gives us a great wisdom and a
[40:51] connection to the nature and spirit of
[40:52] christ and we tap into an overcoming
[40:54] power who we can conduct ourselves above
[40:57] strife and jealousy and difficulties and
[40:59] hurts and heartaches and estrangements
[41:01] why by the power that's been unloosed
[41:03] just by the true revelation of
[41:05] melchizedek
[41:06] here he is el shaddai in our hour what
[41:09] ministering to us in our journey from
[41:11] election to the body change in however
[41:13] it's working out for you right now very
[41:16] literally
[41:18] he says you'll just wind yourself away
[41:20] from the real thing when we try to be
[41:22] odd and separate ourselves and and do
[41:25] things different
[41:28] i want to close on this thought
[41:32] i think it's just uh
[41:37] it's a very
[41:38] large
[41:40] a thought but i just want to hit on it
[41:42] very very quickly as i close
[41:43] and the supreme faith of abraham
[41:47] our supreme faith revealed in abraham
[41:50] even in death
[41:52] he was testifying of the resurrection
[41:56] as he went to offer up isaac
[41:58] we've looked in the scripture how he had
[42:00] experienced the resurrection his own
[42:01] body
[42:02] he see the resurrection of the womb of
[42:03] sarah and there's other things that we
[42:05] know in the message that show these
[42:06] changes happening in them to be able to
[42:08] bring forth a child
[42:10] but then when he is offering up isaac
[42:12] it's a direct
[42:14] that obedience is directly connected to
[42:17] a revelation that he had
[42:19] of the power of god to raise the dead
[42:21] and the promise that he would and he
[42:24] knew
[42:24] that god would have to raise up isaac
[42:27] and so he actually gave isaac in symbol
[42:30] a foreshadowing in a type a resurrection
[42:34] and he was expressing this on mount
[42:36] moriah
[42:37] but when ev when abraham faces death in
[42:39] his family he faces it with the
[42:42] resurrection and view
[42:45] and i don't have these scriptures on
[42:46] here but i want to just read through
[42:47] them very quickly to close
[42:49] this but in genesis chapter 23
[42:52] reverses one and items skip to four and
[42:54] then skip to verse 19. so sarah was 107
[42:57] and 20 years old 127 years old these
[42:59] were the years of the life of sarah
[43:03] and sarah died in kerjafarba
[43:06] the name the same is hebron in the land
[43:08] of canaan they say it was the the valley
[43:11] of four the city of the four
[43:13] and there's
[43:15] um kind of a etymology of that or a
[43:17] legend or a story as to why it had
[43:19] received that name but it's it's
[43:21] identified with hebron in the land of
[43:22] canaan this is part of the promise given
[43:24] to abraham and abraham came to mourn for
[43:26] sarah and to weep for her abraham stood
[43:28] up from before his dead and spake unto
[43:30] the sons of heft saying i am a stranger
[43:32] and a soldier and are with you give me a
[43:34] possession of a burying place with you
[43:37] then i may bury my dead out of my sight
[43:40] and he transacts with them to buy a
[43:42] piece of land here
[43:44] in in hebron
[43:46] near hebron there he says in verse 19
[43:48] and after this abraham buried sarah his
[43:50] wife
[43:52] and the cave of the field of macpilla
[43:55] before mamrie remember it was in the
[43:57] plains of memory that god visited him in
[43:58] genesis 18. and now he buys a cave of
[44:01] the field of macpela before mamrie in
[44:04] the same as hebron in the land of canaan
[44:06] it mentions it again and this is the
[44:08] place where abraham we realize now
[44:10] abraham by this point
[44:11] has walked with god
[44:14] knew the promises were eternal abraham's
[44:16] very mature in his faith he's seen
[44:18] certain things still yet unfold before
[44:20] him in his advanced age here and his
[44:23] wife dies before he does and now he's
[44:26] going to bury his wife and when he does
[44:28] he buys a piece of land in the cave of
[44:30] the field of machpelah before mamrie and
[44:33] he buries his wife there
[44:35] then in the next
[44:36] two chapters later it says in genesis
[44:38] chapter 25 verses 8 9 then abraham gave
[44:41] up the ghost and died in a good old age
[44:43] an old man and full of years and was
[44:45] gathered to his people and his sons
[44:47] isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave
[44:50] of machpelah in the field of ephraim the
[44:52] son of zohar the hittite which is before
[44:54] mammary
[44:56] and so you find that not only is sarah
[44:58] buried there but abraham is buried there
[45:01] and then when they come into the land of
[45:03] egypt and israel goes into egypt he
[45:06] makes one he makes one request he says
[45:08] don't bury me in egypt
[45:11] and he and he speaks to me in genesis 49
[45:13] he's speaking to them my father was
[45:15] buried there
[45:16] and he said am i uh or not my father
[45:19] abraham was buried there sarah was
[45:20] buried there and he starts to go through
[45:21] the list of all that was buried there
[45:23] and she says you swear to me that you
[45:25] won't bury me here in egypt but take me
[45:27] and bury me there
[45:29] in the same place and he makes this
[45:31] statement in genesis 49 31 they were
[45:33] buried
[45:34] there they buried abraham and sarah his
[45:37] wife there they buried isaac and rebecca
[45:40] his wife and there i buried leah
[45:43] notice how he's going through jacob now
[45:45] he's going through each one of these
[45:46] steps to say this is where abraham and
[45:49] sarah barrett isaac and rebecca there
[45:52] israel speaking i buried leah now so you
[45:54] take my body put me in the same place
[45:57] it's important to realize now to a jew
[45:59] where everything is natural and it
[46:00] relates to a geographical promise
[46:02] something very important about being
[46:04] buried in that place it says in genesis
[46:06] chapter 50 verse 13 for his sons carried
[46:08] him now he is being carried israel's
[46:10] being carried into the land of canaan
[46:13] and buried him in the cave of the field
[46:15] of machpelah which abraham bought with
[46:18] the field for possession of a burying
[46:19] place of ephraim the hittite before
[46:21] memory
[46:23] they're all going to be buried in the
[46:24] same place
[46:26] when it says that it was the king of the
[46:28] city of the four one of the legends is
[46:30] that it was this it's the place where
[46:31] adam abraham isaac and jacob are all
[46:34] buried
[46:35] and those are the four that they
[46:36] referred to and that's why they said
[46:37] this is the why this land or this region
[46:40] is called the city of the four and then
[46:42] even you find that joseph gives a
[46:44] commandment to his people he says one
[46:45] day god's gonna visit you and when he
[46:48] does you carry my bones out of egypt and
[46:50] you bury me in the same place of my
[46:53] fathers
[46:55] now what why would it matter
[46:58] why would it matter to them to have
[46:59] their bones buried in a particular place
[47:02] these days we cremate bodies and we scat
[47:04] them over baseball fields or in the
[47:05] ocean or favorite fishing pond or you
[47:08] know or we just keep them on the altar
[47:09] and we don't really maybe think much
[47:11] about the exact location where we bury
[47:12] them why because we believe one day
[47:14] things are going to change or we're
[47:15] going to have changed by they're going
[47:16] to resurrect but today to abraham and i
[47:18] want to start with abraham he is so
[47:21] intent on being burying sarah in the
[47:24] right place and then he also is buried
[47:27] there and each one who's in this line of
[47:29] the promise because who is the god of
[47:30] god of abraham isaac and jacob they're
[47:32] all buried in the same place with their
[47:34] wives
[47:35] this is an important thing and brother
[47:36] adam says they knew the first fruits of
[47:38] the resurrection were coming up from
[47:40] that land
[47:42] so abraham is even when he goes to bury
[47:44] his wife it's not indiscriminately it's
[47:47] not just ho-hum it's well i've got to
[47:48] find a place to bury her but he's doing
[47:50] it with the revelation and his
[47:52] revelation is not testifying of well i
[47:54] just want some place close to me where i
[47:56] can mourn at her grave his revelation is
[47:58] one day there's going to be a
[47:59] resurrection and it's going to be in
[48:01] this land and i want to be in that place
[48:03] where the resurrection
[48:04] is brother said look at those prophets
[48:07] back there even says job is buried in
[48:09] that place says they know knew in a
[48:11] literal sense that the first
[48:13] resurrection the first fruits would be
[48:14] in palestine abraham bought a place and
[48:17] he buried sarah how did he do it by
[48:20] revelation knowing that there was going
[48:21] to be a resurrection so that even listen
[48:24] to this even in death abraham is acting
[48:27] according to a revelation of the
[48:29] resurrection and we too can have the
[48:31] same kind of disposition in the face of
[48:34] troublesome times and even in the face
[48:36] of death listen there is no shame if a
[48:38] loved one goes by way of the grave there
[48:40] is no shame if a believer goes by way of
[48:42] the grave because we can die in the
[48:44] faith with the face knowing that one day
[48:46] there will be a resurrection because
[48:48] i've been buried in jesus christ and
[48:50] that's where the resurrection is
[48:54] he says and they did buried there in
[48:56] this one place they did because being
[48:58] prophets they understood that the first
[49:00] fruits of the resurrection
[49:02] would be
[49:03] in palestine
[49:05] that amazing that even when it came to
[49:07] burying the dead
[49:09] there's something about his actions that
[49:11] testifies and speaks of
[49:13] believing in
[49:15] a resurrection
[49:16] believing in the power over death that
[49:19] was the supreme faith revealed in
[49:20] abraham
[49:22] abraham held the revelation
[49:25] and then his life laid the pattern
[49:28] and i believe you can look at his life
[49:30] and see that his example holds a type
[49:33] let's stand to our feet tonight
[49:36] a type of rapturing faith
[49:38] in this end time
[49:42] we've looked at the end
[49:46] and we've looked at
[49:49] the type of the change of our body a
[49:51] type of the
[49:53] climactic moment when death is swallowed
[49:56] up in victory
[49:58] that
[50:00] that spot
[50:02] where it's swallowed up
[50:05] mortality is swelled up by immortality
[50:09] as i even as i minister right now the
[50:10] thought strikes my heart
[50:13] that when we go to the meeting in the
[50:14] air
[50:17] anytime i've ever heard it preached or
[50:19] even
[50:21] when you have it dramatized in the
[50:23] message
[50:24] the questions we're going to be asked
[50:28] and the
[50:29] the thing that stands out the most
[50:31] about the people who are alive and
[50:33] remain
[50:34] is
[50:35] it's not like so what was it like to
[50:36] have your body changed
[50:38] right
[50:39] has anyone ever dramatized that like
[50:41] we're going to be in the meeting there
[50:42] and peter's going to hunt us outside so
[50:43] tell me what was it like to have your
[50:45] body changed
[50:47] he's going to have a body just like ours
[50:49] you have a body just like his
[50:52] you know he you there those in their
[50:53] theophy is going to pick up a glorified
[50:55] body we who are in this body going to be
[50:56] changed and meet our theophanies and
[50:58] we're all going to be in the same makeup
[50:59] in the same body liking of the glorious
[51:01] body that christ has and we're all going
[51:03] to have that experience but you know
[51:04] what they're going to want to know about
[51:05] how did you overcome laodicea
[51:08] isn't that how it's always dramatized
[51:10] and the kind of the the way that it's
[51:11] expressed to us is it's not so much man
[51:14] man how did you do it how did you how
[51:17] did you change your bodies and how did
[51:18] you they're gonna look at a life
[51:21] and maybe they don't ask how did you
[51:22] change their body because they realized
[51:23] the mystery isn't how you overcame
[51:25] laodicea
[51:27] it's not so what what were you doing
[51:28] when your body changed i mean i was just
[51:30] i've been waiting for you for this to
[51:31] happen for so long and what happened in
[51:33] that moment
[51:34] so
[51:34] how did you overcome laodicea how did
[51:37] you overcome the evil day by day by day
[51:39] because we were all cheering you on
[51:41] knowing that it was going to be you in
[51:43] the regular routine of the scriptures
[51:45] and god revealing himself that was going
[51:46] to bring to you the rapturing revelation
[51:50] and and it unfolds day by day by day
[51:54] i think i trust i desire especially
[51:57] brother wes
[51:58] before service
[52:00] at a minimum my desire when i minister
[52:01] is that we create into you a greater
[52:03] appetite
[52:04] to get into the message and find out
[52:05] what your what's been taught
[52:08] at a minimum if i could accomplish one
[52:09] thing it'd give you a greater appetite
[52:11] to dig into the word of god and find out
[52:12] more
[52:14] and uh and some may critically say every
[52:16] time i hear you preach i just want to go
[52:18] and find out really what was said you
[52:19] know what at a minimum i hope that's
[52:21] what's happening
[52:22] because there's
[52:23] there's there's critics
[52:25] there's critics that stream the services
[52:26] because they want to find something to
[52:27] criticize
[52:29] and uh and guess what no offense i'm not
[52:32] preaching to you
[52:35] but at a minimum i'd hope that you get a
[52:37] hunger in your hearts
[52:38] uh for more of the word and to find out
[52:40] what brother bannon really taught and
[52:41] what what what does the bible say about
[52:43] this what does the word say
[52:45] and then i would say that my burden for
[52:47] you is to just feel a lightening of your
[52:49] spirits and a losing to realize you're
[52:52] in the right you're in the pattern
[52:54] you're in the cadence you're in the
[52:55] rhythm things are marching on nothing's
[52:57] out of control
[52:59] the stablers have been put on the ship
[53:00] god knows exactly what he's doing we
[53:02] just need to completely yield to his
[53:04] presence completely yield to his desire
[53:06] for our lives and begin to live out
[53:08] whatever whatever agenda he has for us
[53:10] whatever challenge he has before us
[53:12] realize that it's in these small things
[53:14] and in these uh uh in these
[53:16] little individual challenges we have
[53:18] that don't seem to be so great that
[53:19] christ can make himself known to us in
[53:21] the regular routine of everyday life
[53:24] that maybe it could give the regular
[53:25] routine just a little bit more uh
[53:28] excitement
[53:29] much more important stories these small
[53:32] things that i'm being asked to do are
[53:33] really really important
[53:35] god bless you tonight we love you very
[53:37] much we appreciate your attentiveness
[53:39] and your patience and allowing us the
[53:40] opportunity to wrap up this foundation
[53:43] do you have a need tonight
[53:45] is there any need you might have does
[53:46] anybody have a need in their body need a
[53:48] touch of healing right now
[53:50] he's here
[53:51] [Music]
[53:53] the angel
[53:54] of the covenant is here and there's
[53:56] divine healing in that covenant
[54:00] the the angel the top the one the the
[54:02] atonement all that's in the atonement
[54:04] it's for you right now do you have
[54:05] anybody that's been experiencing a kind
[54:07] of like a melancholy just kind of a a
[54:10] little grayness in their lives and just
[54:11] kind of a malaise and can't seem to
[54:13] quite get out of a fog if you've been
[54:14] experiencing that i believe he can
[54:15] deliver you right now if you want to
[54:17] take him at his word and believe it
[54:20] if you have an emotional need in your
[54:22] hearts where you've been anxious you've
[54:24] been bound you don't know why he's here
[54:25] right now
[54:27] to release your cares
[54:29] if you have a relationship that's a
[54:30] little bit out of cater and you can't
[54:32] seem to find a way to get it back on
[54:33] track he's here right now
[54:35] to give you the wisdom to humble your
[54:36] heart you guys sometimes in our lives we
[54:39] come up against a problem and we know
[54:41] there's a huge issue but
[54:43] and it's very very important to us
[54:46] and god can come on the scene
[54:49] and effect change but he won't do it
[54:51] until you humble yourself to be changed
[54:54] yourself
[54:56] and a lot of times just what it is is
[54:57] for us just to really get that and
[54:59] resistance and that pride you know
[55:01] exactly what i'm talking about it's just
[55:03] something some ugliness right there that
[55:06] hinders you and stops you and what you
[55:07] need is god just to break that down
[55:10] let me just explain it this way so you
[55:11] it can be identified what you're
[55:13] wrestling with you know when you you
[55:15] know you ought to compliment somebody
[55:18] but you don't want to do it because
[55:20] there's something in there that just
[55:21] won't let you say that's a really
[55:23] beautiful engagement ring
[55:25] but you don't want to say it because
[55:26] you're jealous or
[55:27] it's bigger than yours you don't like
[55:29] them or something happen and there's
[55:30] just something in there that's keeping
[55:32] you from being honest being real and
[55:34] saying the right thing that's what i'm
[55:36] talking about you need god to take that
[55:37] away
[55:38] he's here to do it
[55:41] i believe we can just open our hearts to
[55:43] him could we all do that together as
[55:44] family tonight say here i am lord
[55:47] deal with my heart you know what i have
[55:48] need of tonight
[55:49] [Music]
[55:52] do it personally now as we are all
[55:54] together you can even begin to pray
[55:56] yourselves as i just encourage you and
[55:58] exhort you to pray
[56:00] and to believe all things are possible
[56:03] do you realize abraham would have had
[56:04] prayers just like this
[56:08] where he struggles and he wrestles with
[56:10] certain things
[56:12] even condemned by his
[56:14] decisions
[56:16] haunted by the pastor
[56:20] strife whatever it might be
[56:21] [Music]
[56:22] abraham had conversations with god a lot
[56:25] like what you're having right now
[56:31] and supreme faith is not a faith that
[56:33] has never been hindered and that has
[56:35] never been
[56:36] weakened or never been up and down
[56:38] supreme faith is a faith that has
[56:40] [Music]
[56:42] identified weaknesses and challenges and
[56:44] been raw and been honest
[56:47] and accepted god's help
[56:50] notice how he said we read it
[56:53] it'll be revealed when it has need to be
[56:56] done
[56:57] if you have a need tonight i believe he
[56:59] wants to reveal himself to you
[57:01] a gracious heavenly father
[57:02] [Music]
[57:05] come
[57:06] by
[57:08] the hearts of your people tonight and
[57:10] touch the needs of the people
[57:14] what may be in their hearts lord it
[57:16] could be varied and even in individual
[57:18] hearts there could be many different
[57:19] things that someone is wrestling with
[57:22] but i pray lord that you could come and
[57:26] reveal yourself as healer as deliverer
[57:28] savior
[57:29] as encourager
[57:30] [Music]
[57:33] as humbler whatever would need tonight
[57:35] lord i pray that you would meet the
[57:36] people in their need
[57:38] lord as i pray i'm just struck with the
[57:40] image of how that sometimes we enter
[57:43] into
[57:44] role-playing as christians
[57:47] and we play certain roles within
[57:48] families and within churches
[57:51] we're always trying to fit a particular
[57:52] narrative or play a particular part
[57:56] and somehow that informs us and we
[57:58] operate within this construct of what
[57:59] other people see about us and think
[58:01] about us and what our parents said about
[58:03] us and kind of who i am as a person it
[58:06] has kind of been shaped over many many
[58:08] different years and we just kind of take
[58:09] on this persona
[58:11] [Music]
[58:12] maybe it enters into a realm of one
[58:14] who's always going through difficulty
[58:16] and one who's always troubled or maybe
[58:17] it's kind of the person of one who's
[58:19] always sick or maybe it's someone who's
[58:21] just always strong and never going
[58:22] through troubles but lord the problem
[58:24] with all those personas is it becomes a
[58:26] very thick layer that we live behind
[58:30] that keeps you from dealing honestly
[58:32] with our hearts
[58:34] and lord tonight we lay it all aside
[58:38] and we say as abraham did over and over
[58:40] again here i am lord
[58:42] [Music]
[58:43] here i am
[58:45] here stands tonight aaron
[58:49] not the image of what i think others
[58:51] think about me not the image that i
[58:52] think of myself not what i want to be
[58:54] not what i used to be but just who i am
[58:57] here i am lord
[59:00] and in our honesty father we're asking
[59:02] for help
[59:04] lord we pray for those that are sick
[59:06] [Music]
[59:09] families in our church that are
[59:10] traveling some while traveling are sick
[59:13] and i believe
[59:15] that all fear should be crossed out
[59:18] we see you working in a very mighty way
[59:21] very powerful way
[59:23] [Music]
[59:24] and in doing so father it has increased
[59:26] our faith and given us courage that no
[59:28] matter how
[59:29] dark it gets and how tough things are
[59:31] getting we can believe that you're
[59:33] you're doing something so miraculous and
[59:35] so profound and so powerful that we
[59:38] believe that we are living through every
[59:40] challenge and every difficulty even
[59:42] sickness in our body the pandemic that's
[59:44] wagging
[59:45] its tongue in our face and trying to
[59:47] tempt us to doubt lord we believe you're
[59:49] doing great things and we're going to
[59:50] rise above these challenges and live
[59:52] through it
[59:53] it may give faith to the believers who
[59:55] are present tonight to believe for the
[59:56] salvation of family to believe for the
[59:58] change of their hearts to believe for
[1:00:00] the change of circumstances
[1:00:04] i believe that you can do it lord
[1:00:06] we're claiming this these promises
[1:00:09] committing the people to you now in the
[1:00:11] name of the lord jesus
[1:00:12] christ
[1:00:14] amen amen
