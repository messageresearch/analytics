TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so if you just look again at where we were just reading in first john chapter 2 i'd like to read a few more verses so you can understand where our heart is at on this thought of the bride's advocate and it says my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any men sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and that's and that's an extraordinary conclusion and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that say if i know him and keep it not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him this is the love apostle this is this is the one that it's a spouse's love and he's very bold with his love if someone says they know god but don't keep his commandments he's lying and the truth is not in him verse 5 but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that sayeth he abideth in him ought himself also to so was also so to walk even as he walked and so i'd like to perhaps maybe even begin a subject but my title today is the bride's advocate and this has been it came upon my heart in a real real substantial way in a very very heavy way and what i'm actually pondering is the thought of the bride's advocacy and the bride's public ministry and what we do as bride and what's expected of us as members of the bride of jesus christ and it began with this thought on an advocate and even to advocate so you can have the noun you could have the verb and and so just i want to speak on this and make it real personal to you i used the bride's advocate in a way to speak maybe as of us being collective but it's your advocate i want this to be very personal to you as we explore this subject and in verse 1 it says my little children these things right i unto you and he says and he's making this conclusion we have an ad the father we have an advocate with the father so in this thought where he says we we have an advocate with the father he brings himself into this it's very ticking point that he's trying to make that we have this advocate with the father and in doing so john is addressing the elect and i want that to maybe be uh the most significant thing you identify here at the outset is john is addressing the elect now to understand kind of the the direction he's going and the point that he's trying to take a look at uh i'm going to grab this red mic and uh and the old-fashioned way and just hold the mic this will keep me keep me busy with one hand if you want to um just look at first john chapter one i think it's important to kind of look that look at this in the sense that um to kind of get an idea of what john is laying out and what forms the basis for his uh his comment in chapter two verse one and we know john didn't write in verse chapter four map but just so you can understand the flow of this letter and his epistle i'm just going to make some summary conclusions from first john chapter one and in the first three verses he's establishing that life has been given to the elect by jesus christ so he begins by by dealing with how that life has been given and we have received life and that through that life there's fellowship with the father and with his son jesus christ i think maybe i'm a little hot there if it's too loud you can just start plugging your ears and giving off signals but through this life that we've received there's fellowship with with god and his son jesus and it's through that fellowship i want us to maybe think in terms of the fellowship being communion so because we've received life it's through that life that we have fellowship and then in verse 4 he says and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full and so in this i found that there was some continuity with the subject that we had been pondering and ministering on in pure joy he says i'm writing these things so that the joy that you have may be complete and it may be full and it may be uh just total for you and so i'm writing these things that your joy may be full and then in verses five to 7 he's declaring that god is light and that him there's no darkness and that in light the the nature of light and its essential characteristic is that it exposes any pretense as to our fellowship and since god is light and in so we receive this life and this life is light and so we have this light inside of us that exposes any hypocrisy any pretense any religion anything of self that relates to our fellowship so it's going to expose anything that's not in harmony with god anything that relates to more religion or more personality or pretense or politics when it comes to our fellowship and so that's what light does we have life by jesus christ it puts us in fellowship and we have light also by jesus christ and that exposes any hypocrisy with respect to our fellowship and then in verses 8 to 10 and this is how he's kind of really ramping up to chapter two he addresses those that would deny any need for reconciliation by jesus christ someone say well i don't i don't need to be reconciled by jesus christ i have no sin i keep the law or i'm a good person and i do good things i have integrity and he's talking about how that one would say we have no need to be be forgiven for we have not sinned and brother adams actually asked about this question in question and answers and he's asked you know how can you reconcile the fact that you say that you know it's possible for a believer to live in a place where they do not sin when it says that um that if someone says they have not sinned then they're a liar so these kind of ask this very pointed question and brother branham kind of takes it and summarize it to say that when you say you haven't sinned you're wrong and and it's not so much relating to the last five minutes he's just saying if you say that you have as a blanket statement have never sinned then you're wrong and if you say this as someone who is not a christian and is not a believer i have not sinned he says you're wrong you need to be born again so he's it's identifying this particular condition of the individual it doesn't relate to their profession of christ jesus or the fact that they're sealed with the holy ghost and kind of a blanket statement about their justification before christ but rather just someone as they're examined by the truth or maybe someone in sin or in the world or maybe someone who denies the existence of god if they say they haven't sinned they're lying and brother i'm saying that this is a condition before you're born again and a condition afterwards and so in the process of answering that question he makes this statement before you've received the holy ghost you are believing unto eternal life that's a very important principle to understand he talks about believing unto but you do not have eternal life until you receive the holy ghost so there is no condition of being little b little a born again and having eternal life no you cannot have eternal life without having the holy ghost because you have eternal life when you receive the holy ghost because the holy ghost he says is eternal life the holy ghost is god it's god's life in you then you've got eternal life and so he's identifying the point at which john is saying if you say you have not sinned you're a liar and it's when someone is in fact still in their sin unrepentant and haven't having not recognized or acknowledged the fact that they're in a sinful condition they are a liar because in first john chapter 3 verse 9 it says whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin now here's a tremendous paradox if you say that you have not sinned you're a liar but then he who is not born he who is born again doth not commit sin and i know that there's actually some semantics there you could look at it as mere semantics but there's a very precise language that's being used if someone says that they uh have have no sin then they're a liar it says that i um if any man saith that he does not sin or has not sinned and keeps his commandments and he's talking about only uh laying it out in such a way to where there's this point at which someone says oh i have no sin i'm fine i'm not i haven't done anything wrong and and i have i have no sin well you need to be born again and it's identifying this point at which one is in sin needs to acknowledge it to be born again but when john says whosoever is born of god he shifted the focus and now the focus is no longer on on this point at which one needs to acknowledge their sinful nature but once they're born of god he's using a very rich statement they they do not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god now that's a very very heavy statement that's a very a very substantial statement and and and so in recognizing that it may seem to be a paradox but there's a beautiful truth that harmonizes these statements and breathing these brings these things together for it says in first john verse 10 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us and so there's a there's this we cannot say oh i never sinned because one who has been guilty and recognizes their guilt can acknowledge no i was a sinner i was steeped in unbelief and i was wayward and so this very strong things that he's saying and it's it's similar to what john how john is admonishing the believer in first john chapter 2 verse 4 he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him so kind of notice this symmetry if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us if we say that we know him and keep not his commandments we are liars and the truth is not in us so there's a symmetry to how john is approaching the believer to get them to acknowledge the full grace of jesus christ and so john in this outset he's establishing some very profound principles i can just maybe summarize it that way and they're very necessary things that this statement in first john chapter 2 verse 1 is built upon and i wanted just to give some acknowledgement to that so you can kind of understand it within this context because there's these things that he's using that kind of formed the book ends to this point that he makes in verse one of chapter two it says my little children these things right i unto you that you sin not and notice how that parallels with what he said in verse four these things i write unto you that your joy may be full and so there's a connection then between us not sinning and being in a state in the state of sin and our joy being full i write these things that you send not i write these things that your joy may be full and if any man's sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous now what he's dealing with is how that when we make a mistake or it's or if i can say it this way it's sin that causes the sense of regret we know we can all say amen to that when we find that we are disbelieving our faith isn't strong it's sin that causes this sense of regret and then ultimately by our own uh beating ourselves up and through the efforts of the devil to support that it results in shame and what we're wrestling with is this guilty conscience and even a conscience that therein can become defiled so it's sin or unbelief of our own accord and of our own doing that weakens our minds and so he's kind of dealing with that he says if we sin i i'm writing to you that your joy may be full and these things i write unto you that you sin not but he's saying this if we sin notice this if we sin we have an advocate and this is what i'm wanting to amplify for the rest of our time together today is that if we send just think of that phrase and what john would mean by it and not make our own assumptions about it if we send we have an advocate well what does it mean that we have an advocate and i want to bring you back to what we said at the outset john is addressing those who have the holy spirit we took our time to go kind of this overview of the first few verses of the chapter in the of chapter 1 and verses 5 to 7 and kind of walk through those different verses that even brother branham addressing verse 10 if any man say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us address those things that you can see that brother branham is identifying that who is being spoken to in chapter two are those who've been born again by the word of truth so there's been this separation made out of sin there's been a separation from the world these my children these things i write unto you that you sin not and if any man sin he's writing to those who have the holy ghost and so there's this concept of this idea that we do something that we know is not in harmony with what we know to be the truth he's speaking to the born again can we accept that today that he's speaking to the bride so he says we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the perpetuation for our sins that word even there is used of the mercy seat he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know and i want you to notice the language and i'm just reading this again because i want to go to john chapter 14 so you can see how this relates to the born-again those who have the holy spirit hereby we know that we know him if we keep his commandments that's kind of how we know that we know god as we know his commandments and we have the nature within us to follow them and walk walk in them he that saith i know him oh i know him i know him and keep not keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him so if you say that you know christ but don't obey his word and don't believe his word that that's not the language doesn't make sense anymore oh i believe them it'd be like saying well if i told you it was raining it was raining uh here's an umbrella and you go i believe you and you walked out into the rain and acted like it wasn't raining and you get out there in the middle of the rainbow i'm soaking wet it's like well if you believed me you would have taken the umbrella and so there's a there's an action that takes place following belief that indicates oh i truly i truly believe and understand what's being said so he continues but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected so if you keep his commandments you keep his precepts keep his word in that one who does so is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him we know that we're in him because we know his word and we keep his word he that saith he abideth in him and this is kind of as he's already said he that says this but doesn't do it he's a liar and he that says this and doesn't do it makes him a liar now he kind of kind of helps us out a little bit so that you don't lie he says he that says he abides in him ought to himself also walk even as he walked so he said so you're not a liar if you say you abide in him then we should strive to walk like him so he's making a connection between the indwelling truth the truth that's on the inside of the believer and how that if we have the truth on the inside of us then we'll act in harmony with the truth that is observable so if we have a written word we have a spoken word we have a word that we've received then the indwelling truth will act in harmony with the revealed truth the indwelling truth will act in harmony with the word now if you turn to john chapter 14 i want you to recognize again the symmetry with what jesus said when he told the believers or told the disciples that he was going to send them the comforter as john is saying my little children we have an advocate with the father and he talks about being in him and believing the truth and walking in the truth and if you are in him then you obey if you have the truth then you keep his commandments and herein is the love of god perfected when jesus is actually teaching the disciples about the comforter that's to come which is the holy spirit he uses the exact same language so john is writing in some way this would be my observation and so that's maybe a little bit of a disclaimer and an invitation for you to tell you tell you tell me that you you disagree with me but this is my observation that john is writing very precisely from what he heard jesus say in john chapter 14. verse 15 to 6 26 if you love me keep my commandments it's the very same thing if you say that you know him and do not keep his commandments then you're a liar if you love me keep my commandments and then notice how beautiful this is i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even as john saying he that saith he abideth in him also ought to walk as he walked there's this language that's a very very particular and very exact and it's tracking what jesus said and notice even a beautiful phrase on jesus's part if you love him you're going to keep his commandments and then this is what he prays he actually prays that he'll send you a comforter so if you love him you want to keep his commandments if you love him you want to serve him so knowing that you love him and you want to serve him he says i'm going to pray that he'll give you and he's called another comforter because jesus is there present with him as a in the flesh physically present teaching guiding instructing admonishing and he knows that he's going to be gone and he says i know that if you love me you're going to keep my commandments and in my absence i'm going to pray that he sends you another comforter that he may abide with you forever because he knew that he would be leaving and then he describes he kind of makes connects this language together even the spirit of truth so the comforter and the spirit of the truth are working are synonymous here and now catch the language whom the world cannot receive who is it the comfort or the spirit of truth because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you this place is the comforter and the spirit of truth in this position to where it's not observable by the world and it's not known by the world but it's something that's within the believer and that the believer is in harmony and fellowship with and then in turn it being in them is something that's going to be working itself outward that's why it says you ought to walk this way and you ought to live this one you have to act this way and keep his commandments because then it becomes an expression of the indwelling truth he says i will not leave you comfortless and so it's kind of a derivative of the comforter i will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also brother man said speaking to his wife so this has very specific end time fulfillment at that day and he says what day when the revelation is made known takes in christ is the mystery and brings this to a perfect fulfillment in the hour that we're living at that day you shall know that i am in the father in ye and me and i in you try to unravel that i am in the father you are in him but then he is in you this is not a doll that you can unpack and get it all straight this is something so linked and woven together that it's one and he's talking about he that saith he abideth in him ought to walk as he walk if i am in the i am in the father and you are in me then i am in you verse 21 and he that my he that hath my commandments and keepeth him he it is that loveth me if he keeps my commandments what is he saying in him is the love of god perfected and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him such beautiful admonishment encouragement and strength of disciples and judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that you will thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not into the world because this is a good question because the world doesn't know the holy spirit cannot receive them cannot know but it's going to be in you so it's a very perceptive astute question say well then how is it that you're going to manifest yourself to us but in doing so the world not receive it in the world not see it jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words he's really repeating the similar things and my father will love him and will come unto him and make our abode with him it's the very same things john's talking about that we have life by jesus christ and through life there's fellowship and communion with the father and this is an indwelling light and it dwells on the inside of us we have this light that's leading us in guiding us he that loveth me not keepeth not my saying so he comes back to i have a word if i'm in you you'll keep my word if you don't love me you won't keep my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you now notice what the holy ghost is he shall teach you all things so he's a teacher bring all things to your remembrance so he's a reminder whatsoever i've said unto you this is the nature of the comforter he's going to abide with you forever he's the spirit of truth that the world cannot receive he's given this designation of comforter he says the comforter is the holy spirit he will teach you all things and bring all things in remembrance whatsoever things i have said unto you so there could be this this thought on the disciples part we've only had these three years with christ and his time he's speaking of these things that seem very anonymous and even once they get to the point to know that he's gonna be gone just think of how they might have felt like did we write that down did we know it and how are we gonna remember this and these things are so different than what we've ever heard before oh do you remember what he said that one day over here and do you remember what he said over there there could be a lot of pressure how are we going to remember all this but he's speaking a language to give them comfort and to help them understand who this other comforter is going to be the spirit of truth he says which is the holy spirit which is going to be spent sent in my name he's going to teach you all things and anything i've said unto you and anything i've mentioned unto you he'll teach you and bring it to your remembrance so notice this the comforter he says which is the holy ghost and he establishes this as i in one way i want to think of it as a border i guess in another sense it could be the bread to a sandwich but it's like the book ends he's saying that the comforter which is the holy ghost i'm going to send you the comforter like we think of it this way i'm going to send you the comforter i'll do it from your vantage point i'm going to send you the comforter and he's going to be with you forever and then he begins to say and he talks about keeping his commandments keeping his commandments keeping his commandments and then he's asked a question he comes back to keeping his commandments and keeping his commandments if you love him and then he says i'm going to send you a comforter which is the holy ghost so if you just focused on keeping the commandments keeping the if you love me you keep my commandments we could weaponize that real quick right because we could just look at somebody and go oh was that in the commandments you know brother vincent what would jesus do and all of a sudden i could just nail him down and go obviously you don't love him i don't care what your bumper sticker says and we could really nail somebody down but jesus isn't kind of throwing out their sword for us to wield on other people but he's saying if you i will send you the comforter and if you love me you'll keep my commandments and since you love me and want to keep my commandments i'm going to send you the comforter and you have this requirement to keep my word and he wants to end it again with saying i'm going to send you the holy ghost which is the comforter and he'll remind you and he'll teach you and he'll guide you and he'll comfort you so let's not be fearful and worry and so he provides it as a bookend and so he's going to send the comforter and i'm going to admit that i went to great lengths to be sure that i had the greek just right when i say it right because if it's going to get called out in a church in the message it can get called out in this one and maybe they're so kind they wouldn't mention it but they would kind of scoff at how horribly i butchered the greek on this and i wanted maybe just to say it in the english or maybe even texas texan but it's the perak clatos we may say paracletos maybe in texas but the peralt claytos is the word that's used in the greek and this is the the strict translation of the greek it's called it means to be called to one side to be summoned to one's aid so comforter in the scripture and the original word that's used in the uh in the greek and the the word that was used in the writing of this and the inspiration of it is one who is a helper one who is an aide one who is an assistant and it's used and you have to be careful not to attach this meaning too strictly to certain certain things in certain offices and certain dispensations but it's one who's an intercessor an interpleader one who's going to interject and intervenes in a situation so intercessor we can immediately begin to think about the the role of christ or how the high priest would intercede and we can start to really narrow down the scope of what this means but it's one who's going to intervene in a situation and then also be a consoler not just a counselor but an actual consoler and so it's this verbal adjective it's it's something that's trying to convey this idea in the sense of that this one who is going to be a comforter suggests they have the capability to give help they have the willingness and the capability the ability to give help it means to be summoned to one side the para means at one side or side by side put her up i'm by your side i'm side by side clay tossed which means called or invited or divinely employed appointed oh i mean that's kind of there's there's an aisle here if anybody wants to run it it's short so you might have won't have your brakes on but that's exciting to think that it's one you're by my side but you're not just by my side oh look we happen to be in line together divinely appointed to be by your side summoned and invited and caused to be by your side the para by your side but not just by your side by coincidence but it's been called some and invited divinely appointed to be by your side so notice how jesus said in verses 26 or actually i want to go to john chapter 15. we'll drop back here in a moment john chapter 15 verses 26 to 27 but when the comforter is come whom i will send you unto you from the father even the spirit of truth so as he continues in this discourse the comforter which is the holy spirit is the spirit of truth he shall testify of me and notice and ye shall ye also shall bear witness because you've been with me from the beginning so this is the comforter is going to come in the spirit of truth he shall testify of me and ye shall bear witness because you've been with me from the beginning in verse 26 of john chapter 14 he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever things i have said unto you so catch this i want this is the part i'm probably just really cabbaging down on being very specific about it's explicitly the comforters explicitly given to the believers he's actually going so far to say the world can't receive it now think about that so the holy ghost and the spirit of truth and the comforter and we say well it's given specifically explicitly i'd like to say exclusively to the believers now when i say that don't get in your mind a group of people that call themselves believers or attach it to some organization or some group alone we're talking about those that are ordained to life as many as ordained to life believe we're talking about the election of god we're talking about a very real body of jesus christ not just a a nomination that we might give to a group of people it's given exclusively to believers in christ he said he's saying outright the world can't receive it and what he's identifying and we understand this from the language of the message he's identifying the inside teacher to the born again to those that have been born again you have an inside teacher and i know it may seem like i'm not getting anywhere but i actually am and all of a sudden i'm going to look up realize wow we really covered a lot of ground and i'm wanting to come to this point here because this might just be where it starts this watershed a moment to where it starts to really cascade and become very very personal he's talking about a teacher that we have on the inside of us as those who are born again and because we have an inside teacher i'm going to send you the comforter when he comes he's the spirit of truth he's going to testify of me and he's testifying of you where of him inside of you he's an inside witness he's an interpleader he's an intervener he's a counselor he's a comforter he's a teacher he's a guide but where not externally internally and because you have him on the inside and he's inside of you leading you and guiding you then you become witnesses of him the holy ghost just isn't you here kind of in the atmosphere witnessing and testifying but he is he he's an inside teacher and he moves through you and works through you so that you can become witnesses of him in john chapter 16 verse 13. you'll find if you read john 14 15 16 these themes are repeated over and over again he says how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth from where the inside for he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and so this actually speaks to even a prophetic office how the spirit of truth is now using one to become your instructor uh your teacher your guide your helper not to lift themselves up but for your benefit and he shall show you things to come the nature of the spirit of truth the nature of the holy ghost or the comforter the parakletos it's that's been given to the believers he is an inner witness for your personal benefit he's an inside teacher for your personal benefit now if you looked at uh the the actual context of the things that jesus is saying in 14 15 16 even his prayer into 17 this is he's given this promise to the disciples who very soon will be facing persecution to them it'll be great tribulation they're going to be sought after and they're going to be killed and they're going to be cast down they're going to be stoned so jesus even acknowledging these terrible things that are to come he's making this promise to the disciples who are going to see their teacher their master their messiah leave them permanently and go away and having received this great truth now what are we going to do when we face obstacles and opposition and these things are happening and these things are going to be taking place to us christ is declaring that the role of the spirit is to be an inner testifier to them to be an inner strength to them and i've been with you and i've been walking with you and i've been teaching you i've been guiding you and i've been helping you uh uh sell out to this truth by performing miracles and doing things we say we know that god is with you but i'm going to leave and when i leave you need to do everything i said but i'm not just going to leave you alone to do everything i said i'm going to send you a comforter and he's not just going to be even like me telling you what to do externally but he's going to dwell on the inside of you so that when you face trials and tribulations and persecutions and great pressure and even your own weakness and your thoughts and in your body and your mind he's gonna be on the inside of you saying you can do it you can make it you've got this you're the bride of jesus christ you are my disciples you are my elect you are the very ones who've got the truth for your hour you can make it you can do it and be the very one that upholds the stephen in the midst of stoning and can look into the heavens and willingly give his life he didn't do it on his own strength he did it by the inner testifier he did it by strength that he had on the inside of him a support on the inside not a support group on the outside the support on the inside so it is in the context of a hateful spiteful world that jesus says the comforter will testify not to the world but to you even to the point where he says you know what if you're going to get called onto the carpet and you're going to have to give an answer don't worry what you say to your adversary don't worry what you say to the enemy because the holy spirit will tell you what to do how from the inside giving them confidence in the midst of a dark time a tribulation and trials you have an inside teacher you have an inside comfort he calls him the comforter which is the spirit of truth which is the holy ghost he is the peraltas then if we look again at our text first john chapter 2 verse 1 and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous would it be any surprise to you to find that advocate is the same greek word pero clatos it is used five times in the scriptures and it's translated to comforter and then advocate it's the very same office the very same thing so you say ah that was a that was a trick brother aaron if you'd have just told us in the beginning that advocate was the same as comforter we would know that john was using his notes from that sermon in john chapter 14. we would have figured that out without your help but here john is using this language in john 1 john chapter 2 which lines up with john chapter 14 as the same one the very same thing 15 and 16. we have an advocate we have the proclaimtos with us it means one who pleads another's cause it's and it's used in this sense like specifically before a tribunal or before a an inquisition or before a judge and and there's a there's kind of a judicial sense that's given to it and you say oh that's real self-serving brother aaron since you're a lawyer on the weekdays but no it doesn't even mean that it doesn't have to exclusively mean just an attorney but it can just mean someone of influence someone of certain power and prestige someone with some authority that steps in on your behalf before the tribunal and says hey i want to speak on their behalf i want to say something for them so it's not just somebody who has this official title and capacity before the judge though if you want to type it that way we can certainly type it that way but the word has such greater depth and meaning just to narrow it down and i think that's instructive to us to begin to understand what our advocacy is as the bride of jesus christ to be an advocate it's one who defends or maintains a cause one that supports an interest or promotes a cause of a group or just a a particular cause that's what an advocate is the comforter the spirit of truth the holy ghost it is our at he is our advocate that's what comforter is he's an advocate so it's not just one who pat you on the back right we think confidence oh you bored weak dirty sinner it's okay i mean it's almost what we think a comforter is like he's our weighted blanket to help us in our anxiety and that's not what it is even though those things sound really really awesome and i've almost bought one many many times so there's maybe a little birthday hint there uh give me my weighted blanket and and though that might have some physiological effect and psychological effect on something natural that's not what he is he's not a comforter like how many comforts do we really need in in arizona i think we need you know the summer comforter just needs to become a sheet but there's these ideas in terms of a comforter we have this idea i'm not thinking comforter's advocate not just a blanket that's laying there on your bed when you want to feel comfortable crank the crank the ac down to 50 this afternoon and get underneath a down comforter that's not what it is the comforter is an advocate one that defends and maintains and teaches and reminds leads and guides and john is saying jesus christ the righteous is joined to us through the indwelling of the holy ghost through the indwelling of the holy ghost we have access to these things that jesus christ has purchased for us and it forms this unbroken continuity between the believer and god through the indwelling of the holy ghost i want you to think of it that way it's just a picture that i can only just begin to try to describe as i view it that because you are born again you have the holy ghost on the inside of you and then that's what forms this union to god through jesus christ through the price that was paid you have this connection and contact with god and and you have to understand this is something that's unbroken this is something that is permanent this is something that is maintained by the word of truth this is something that you have so that we don't just feel like we're christians that are visiting the confessional every sunday we just don't view that this is something that i just i make myself i kind of work my way around to this place where sometimes i feel good with god no because you are born again you have this continuity with god that you have access to all the time as a believer and so this comforter the comforter is your advocate now let me say this as i choose to maybe i'm desiring to maybe end on this thought but we know that this is an unbroken continuity but we don't always feel that it is and that's what john's dealing with he said you shouldn't live you shouldn't live in this idea of up and down and in and out and you know good enough bad enough there there should be you have a you have a you come to a place where you understand to know that this is permanent this is of god this is for real this is this is everything i need this is this is real i'm connected to this i'm tied to this and come to a place that when you don't feel it you feel awful you feel miserable and you feel weak and you're doubting you just even confess it well i know that's how i feel right now but deep down on the inside i know it's not true i mean that's what you do sometimes i think maybe we look at certain christians and we're like man their faith is so strong and they're so powerful and they always confess the right things and we kind of translate that to mean they don't feel anything else and that's not true it's just they they're just like you they work through it and they work through it enough time and a believer goes through enough battles to where finally they're in the middle of world war 4 thousand for them and it seems like everything's lost this is going to end the worst way possible like oh well you know what i'm looking on 3999 victories so got to be the same in this one we never lost yet and so they're not denying the fact that it's horrible they're not denying the fact that they're in pain they're not defined denying the fact that they're weak and that this is awful and they're not they don't even know a way out but they've learned and they've and they have this conviction that though there may be a lot of things that intervene in in my emotions in my spirit at the end of the day there's one that intercedes there's one that intervenes there's one that interpleads and you summoned to my aid against all my other thoughts against all my other feelings and said can i just testify for a moment against your doubt testify against your imagination testify against your pain testify against your history testify against your complexes and you stand there and say i'll take that witness and your complex says i don't know if you really should do that you've had 46 years of this experience you say well i know i know it's very real i get you but i'm going to take his word for it i have an inner pleater i'm so glad that when my mind was arguing with itself and i was arguing with my emotions and my doubts and my feelings and my complexes and my fears and my melancholy my depression and we were all kind of conspiring and arguing and going through it all of a sudden the holy ghost kind of stepped and said excuse me i got something to say about this from the inside and said i want to weigh in on this i know you see it i know you feel it i know you hear it i know you smelt it i know you taste it i know you imagine it i know you have affections for it i know you remember it i know you're conscious of it it just goes down the road and calls out all all 10 witnesses and says but i'd like to testify that all is well and it's one that intervenes and you know what he doesn't even just say you're a liar you're a liar you're a liar you're a liar you could say yeah i get it i see where you're coming from but where you're wrong is your conclusions on the matter where you're wrong is where this is headed where you're wrong is what this means and stands for us the bride's advocate your advocate in the message what is the holy ghost i'm going to just track through i i took i was reading through this this is the one place that brother branham dealt with it the most significantly on an advocate and so i'm just going to take a number of quotations from that from that sermon i'm going to group them here at the beginning and i want you to know i'm pulling out phrases and if it's not obvious by the way that i've laid it out i apologize but i'm just pulling out particular phrases he says who is that spirit then what is the holy ghost it's christ in you the comforter that's the holy spirit so he becomes the comforter through indwelling in you and he says what is he now notice this language he's using he's a seal he's a sign he's a comforter so the holy ghost is christ the comforter he's a seal he's a sign so you can almost start writing down all these different things that he is then in another place the same sermon what is the holy ghost it's an advocate what is an advocate what does it do make an advocate it has mercy it stands in your place it does things that you can't do it's your perpetuation for your sins it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your resurrection it's all that god has for you he's an advocate oh my goodness stands in your place it has mercy does things you can't do it's a perpetuation for your sins it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your resurrection it's all god has for you he's an advocate and where on the inside he says further he is our advocator he says oh how we thank god for that so it's not this is active this is he's our advocator a seal a sign the spirit of life the god of heaven the comforter the life the advocate this is what an advocate is it says later we walk by the power of the spirit who is our true seal our true advocate our true comforter our true sign that we have been born from above peculiar odd people acting funny taking god at his word calling everything else wrong god's words right that's what the holy ghost is why is it that we're peculiar odd people acting funny taking god at his word calling everything else wrong god's word's right how do we do it because the inside guy if he's left up to us a lot of times we just say i don't know right wouldn't we we're just being honest if we're just going by this we say i don't know it sure looks like it could be well but then again i guess after what you just said maybe it's not and we just bounce back and forth but then by the holy ghost we can call those things that are not as though they were by the holy ghost said no i see it i believe it i've got no question this is the truth and we walk by it a seal a sign a life he says in one place this advocate seal promise so the bride's advocate is a lot of things one thing but it does a lot of things and when john says that we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous it's important to realize that in the context that he's saying this he's not an advocate that we might obtain righteousness or wash our sins away because that's already been accomplished through jesus christ and by the new birth right so he's not creating this scenario where we always have to be reborn again and that we beat ourselves down and says oh well you just need to be born again again again again like you're right i never thought about that again again again again again it was an old man named michael finnegan he got born again and again again over and over and over and we all live in the michael finnegan life and we gotta grow it right back again why i got the wind blew off my board again experience i got to give you one again again again that's not how we ought to live john is saying that you we as children born of god born by the truth we have an advocate but not so that we are constantly re obtaining and reobtaining righteousness or constantly having our justification re-secured those things have been secured through jesus christ by the new birth and then his life as he said in chapter one places us in the light as god himself is in the light and that we have this we have this indwelling of the holy spirit but to keep our fellowship with him to keep this harmony with him to keep this unbroken communion we have an advocate to keep us in this state of sensitivity to god and this awareness of the things of god we have an advocate and listen if you don't catch anything else i've said today besides michael finnegan and this i want you to catch this catch this he is an advocate not because god is temperamental he's an advocate not because his grace is temporary okay i'll shine the light on you whoa wait a minute or i forgive you whoa wait a minute you're just oh just said i don't know about that are we not justified does that not mean we never did it in the first place and then even with that that the seed of that revelation in our hearts and the and the triumph that it brings we still walk in dry places and we wonder if god's angry at us and we wonder if we've made a mistake and how that'll change everything and we can live in a place where things can we begin to get alienated from god so when he says we have an advocate it's not because god is temperamental it's not because his grace is temporary it's because he knows that we're humans and humans are prone to certain thought processes and humans have a weakness and we can be driven to do things we don't want to do so we have an advocate to say don't worry god still loves you don't worry you haven't send away his grace don't worry god isn't angry with you all of a sudden that was placated in jesus christ on the cross and when you acknowledged your sins and were born again and filled with the holy ghost that settled that forever forever settled so the advocate i want you to catch the deeper meaning of it it's not i guess if i make a huge mistake he can work my way back and work me back into the body of christ no it's working in a different realm in the message what is the holy ghost he says that's what the holy ghost is it's a power it's a seal and i noticed uh when i was typing this up i had typed out what is the holy ghost and i said what is the holy host and uh and and i want to thank phoenix christian fellowship for being the holy host today and he says that's what the holy ghost is it's a power it's a seal it's a comforter it's a power it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's a sign oh my it's the assurance that god has received you and and and you he doesn't receive you then give you back god has no return policy glory he's not going to receive you then return you i bought you i don't want you to return you that's not a doctrine to condemn anybody in particular who has a return ministry but it's to understand that if he's received you he's received you he doesn't need to keep the receipt he doesn't need to check the warranty he doesn't need to inspect you he receives you as you are it knows that you're perfect that you'll serve his purpose and he has not hedged and kept the receipt he will never return you back it's the assurance that god has received you god went to the pawn shop bought you back and he said do you need the receipt he says nope i'm keeping it do you need a proof of purchase nope it's mine he said i'm keeping it the proof of purchase is for us receipts for our sake as far as god's concerned he gives you the holy ghost as the receipt he gives you the holy ghost as the proof of purchase he's given it to you so that you know not him he's not looking out on you this morning well who's mine who's mine okay yeah he's got the holy ghost he's mine he knows who you are he gives you the holy ghost so that you know you're his it's the assurance god has received you notice the other way that he says in the same message by one spirit it's god's open door the holy spirit what is it it's god's open door notice the language is similar it's the sign it's the seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's rest it's peace it's goodness it's healing it's life it is god's open door to all these things he's the one that's been divinely appointed to come to your aid to assist you to help you to walk through that door if you're sick and you need healing the holy ghost inside of you is there to walk you through that door if you need goodness he's there to walk you through that door if you need peace he's the assurance that it's yours and because of that this is where i want to transition in into this that more of the dynamic where we begin to relate to it more personally the holy ghost can be summoned as your supporter if this is what he is it's god's open door to all things it's the assurance that god has received you he's an advocate it's all that god has for you then he's there to be a supporter and an encourager in all these things yes you can be healed yes you can have peace yes you can be at rest so the bride's advocate is ever present and he's there to assist you to lead you to comfort you to guide you and i don't mean this disrespectfully to cheer you on he's your biggest cheerleader he's your biggest fan if you kind of looked at this that god's like this judge in a talent contest just waiting to hit the buzzer and kick you off the stage and send in the sandman and pull you off i this is you know late night at the apollo or whatever i know the crowd may boo me and they may want to kick me off the stage that's not that's not what's happening god is there as your supporter he's your hype man he's cheering you on he's there to encourage you he's there to tell you you can do it he's there to help you make it now paragraph 62 of what is the holy ghost he said how we could go into the details of that and break that down of how that win it makes intercession for our ignorance this is so beautiful we can just kind of let this sink in sometimes when we got the holy ghost we ignorantly stagger into something can i get a hearty amen i mean i don't even need to ask you if you believe it you really just need to say it right sometimes even when we have the holy ghost we ignorantly stagger into something now what would we think even i mean maybe maybe based upon our path in life we might think that when we ignorantly stagger into something the holy ghost is going to what smack us on the back of the head and call us fools right you know you idiot you should have known better no notice what he says the holy spirit's there to make advocate for us i'm filled with the holiest i'm a child of god i do something a child of god shouldn't have done the holy ghost is there as an advocate he's our advocator he stands there he's our attorney amen he stands there and pleads for us he don't plead for ourselves we don't plead for ourselves because the holy ghost in us pleads for us the holy spirit given utterance sometimes with words you can't understand and he makes intercessions for us not in the sense of uh interceding for salvation but now it's one who has been the recipient and the beneficiary of salvation now he stands there in a very specific office to help us to help us in a time of need and listen i i don't i don't want you to completely dramatize it to the point for the holy ghost is arguing with god for god not to destroy you please give him another chance don't strike him with lightning that's not what's happening it's for us that's what the holy ghost is when i walk into anything i walk like a little kid you walk like a little fellow we're walking in a dark world full of enemies think about the grace this is the grace that he's extending to the elect we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything you say oh i'm afraid to take a christian life i'm afraid to do this i'm afraid i'll do this don't be afraid we have an advocate don't be afraid we have an advocate amen oh he stands by us he's in us and he makes intercessions for us the holy spirit constantly constantly making an advocate for us all the time what is the what is the picture brother rams trying to paint we live in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything the holy spirit is our advocate in the face of temptation our holy spirit is our advocate in the face of an accusing mind our holy spirit is an advocate even when we make mistakes he says we walk ignorantly sometimes a holy spirit-filled person can be driven to do minor things that he or she doesn't want to do yes yes oh my yes sir yes we can do things that we know that we shouldn't do and when we do that we have an advocate and it's not so much that he's arguing with god to not judge you but he's arguing against your mind that tries to condemn you he argues against the doubt that's in you he argues against the voice of satan that says a son or daughter of god would never do that and tries to tell you're not elect tries to tell you that you've sinned away the day of grace that's how he's an advocate until we achieve the goal until we meet the mark until we obtain our destiny we have an advocate who's there encouraging us not telling god to stay his judgments but on the inside encouraging you to make it jesus christ is not your adversary nor is god your adversary that needs placating right i think sometimes we do that within families all right let me go talk to mom i'll you know if i talk to her maybe she won't get us angry or dad can you talk to mom things are getting crazy i think we're going to get grounded forever and you need someone to kind of go and talk to the boss and it maybe works the other way around in our house but like we need jesus jesus will you get in there and talk to god he's he's mad at us again she's like what did you do this time well i mean i just doubted a little bit but i can tell he's angry i mean i may lose my job and things are upset and okay fine i'll go talk to him that's not it it's not at all he finds you over there discouraged i knew i shouldn't have doubted and i shouldn't done this and i think i'm gonna lose my job and he starts speaking to you you're okay son you're okay daughter god's not gonna punish you listen even if you have to take a few stripes for doing something you shouldn't do even if you reap what you sow god has a way to take even those things that you sow add them to something else that he sows and make something good out of it so don't worry about it don't yeah hey if you made a mistake you do the sin and you do the repenting if you do the sow and you do the reaping but don't worry it doesn't change your eternal status with god it doesn't change the fact that he loves you he's still happy with you and he god our advocate is not there advocating with our adversary who's angry with us peter says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour our adversary is the devil our worst enemy is our flesh and so if we need an advocate it's not with a god who's our adversary or with the god who hates us or a god who's angry with us it's with ourselves in luke chapter 2 let me you you might even remember this statement brother bam says it a few places i used to think god was angry with me but christ loved me that's how he actually used to view it god's anger with me christ loves me but christ he points this out they're actually one of the same and christ was god's means of reconciling you to himself why because he wanted the reconciling he wanted the peace he wanted the joy he wanted the happiness it's something that he wanted for himself so he provided christ that he would no longer have to judge you so it's not an angry god and christ is there saying oh please stop no he loves you and he uses christ as his access to your heart so god's not angry with you and christ loves you that oh we have an advocate because god can be angry with us at a drop of a dime do you realize that satan uses that because that's the dynamics that we experienced in natural relationships thought everything was great and all sudden they're mad at me you know what everything was i thought they loved me i thought we were family we thought this or whatever it might be and bad things begin to happen and then you immediately begin to build these complexes and then you think about god and like well i guess one day i can wake up and be blocked i think one day i can wake up and be disinvited or this is gonna happen that's gonna it doesn't work that way with god when that door closes and you think it's god disinviting you think it's god kicking you out of the the chat group or whatever you think it's god um ostracizing you the comforter's there to say god's got something planned here hold steady this is working for good don't you worry god's god's not angry with you if you make a mistake you just need to repent but this is something that you're going to be okay through this because your adversary is not god or jesus christ it's the devil luke chapter 22 verses 31 and 32 and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as we who his adversary but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren that's advocacy he's identified his adversary satan walks about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour peter then writes be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil he knew when he said simon simon your adversary the devil seeks to sift you as wheat and then jesus plays the role of an advocate this is advocacy but i prayed for you i see that the devil would want to trouble you i see that the devil would want to attack you i see that calamity may be trying to threaten you and tear you down but i've prayed for you that's what it means to be an advocate so we have to resist this weakness of our flesh to let either let our mind or let the devil make god your enemy remember your enemy is anything that's anti-word your enemy is never the word and therefore christ is your advocate god is your advocate he wants you to succeed he wants you to do well he wants you to meet the mark he's not just throwing a bunch of road blocks up there in traps to see if he'll stumble he says in what is the holy ghost this will just be kind of a concluding thought i did just three quotations a couple scriptures he says what is he the one who comes in you gives you peace your sign your comforter comforted at rest sealed how are you it's a sign the world knows something's happened to you what is it it's a comforter doesn't mean the world's always going to agree that it's god but they know they'll see it what is it a seal you are at rest it's your advocate if something happens to you there's something there to make an advocate for you right quick making intercessions an advocate making intercessions as we walk in a dark world full of enemies full of sins full of traps full of everything as children of god that sometimes ignorantly stagger into something as jesus admonished his disciples you're going to go from here and you're going to be tested you're going to be hunted down you're going to be persecuted but i've prayed for you i send you the comforter we have an advocate how long is this advocate how long is that advocate there is even the advocate temperamental as the advocate here look i'm here as long as the retainer is good right as long as you keep the retainer stocked up i'm here no this is he's an advocate he's been divinely appointed to age you if there's any distance or alienation it's it's you cause not him saying enough's enough i'm sorry i'm out of here you cause it notice what it says in hebrews chapter 10 verses 14 to 17. i think this is so beautiful when we think of terms of how he says and if we sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified by one offering once he's perfected forever them that are sanctified do you believe you're sanctified if sanctified then you are scripturally sanctified means you are perfected forever if you're justified you're glorified because he whom he's justified he is glorified these are permanent markers for the elect we don't have to live in the judas track well i could be a judas that comes all the way up to it no that doesn't exist for you it's not possible for you this is a different different scriptural promise so with that heavy statement by one offering he have perfected forever them that are sanctified i'm sanctified and perfected forever wow that creates this perception in this label so he says whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us not a witness to the world a witness to us he hath by one offering perfected forever them that are sanctified and in light of this great calling and significant calling he gives us the holy ghost as an inside witness an inside testifier an inside comforter an inside advocator for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more and the message perfection he says until when perfected forever until you do something that's lustful say something that's wrong be on the outs with your neighbor he says perfected forever and he spells it out he says because if you make a mistake watch the next verse what's the next verse in light of a mistake staggering into something as a believer the holy ghost on the inside is a witness the holy ghost testifies he said it he meant it i'll write the word on the inside of the inside and your sins and your iniquities will i remember no more against you my sins passed yes my sins present yes my sins future yes forgiven forgiven justified justified justified i mean you can spend the rest of your life spending every breath just mentioning something mentioning something justify justify justified don't know it don't know it justify justified justified and you're not going to be able to one day thousands of years later come up with something he's like never thought of that thanks for mentioning it like eternity's not giving god a chance to figure out something you did wrong and you need to be cast down to hell well we're letting hell continue just in case somebody messes up up here it's there's no reality to it it says this in paragraph 95 of what is the holy ghost then we find that when we come to him for he said hebrews 4 that has entered into jesus's rest has ceased from his worldly works as god did from his when he made the world to never return to it again how long how long are you sealed by the holy ghost until the day of your redemption it can't the seal can't be broken how long until the day of your redemption that's the rest comfort advocate seal deliver you have an advocate when we wrestle with our mistakes and our weaknesses we wrestle with things then we we we can open up our hearts to this advocator because it says in ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 this is where brother brown has drawn this from grieve not the holy spirit of god oh so he can be grieved grieve not your advocate grieve not your comforter grieve not the holy spirit of god because you are sealed by it you're kept by it you're delivered by it you find rest by it you find assistance by it you find peace by it assurance healing life the open door to all things the assurance that god has received you it's a it's all that god has for you it's your advocate it's the holy ghost you are sealed by that until the day of redemption so he says don't grieve it now i know that that might kind of seems like i kind of maybe opened a door to a room like well we need to kind of explore this we need to how does that all factor in it shows he's identifying how that there is a dis harmony with the advocate and it's the advocate that's able to keep us in harmony with god our harmony with god never changes in one sense our standing with him always the same we may feel like we go up and down right but our standing in christ is always the same the temperamental nature is related to our human nature and so as we have experiences within the flesh we can we can change the dynamics that we have with the advocate and to better understand who the advocate is is to encourage us is to maintain proper perspective and attitude towards it it's it's the orientation that we have to him that we're always in the right line i almost say in one sense our altitude is never changing it's our attitude that changes and the pilot can tell you that can make a lot of difference and i'm going to close on this statement and brother mike if you'd like to come to the piano listen to how brotherham deals with this statement grieve not the holy spirit the rest the comfort the advocate the seal the deliverer when you have faith and accept to my brother just let that little light begin to grow out first john chapter 1 taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness connect it right there to the same chapter yielding yourself to the spirit then you begin to become a son of god a daughter of god begin to grow in the grace of god the holy spirit begins to build his kingdom within you this is what's happening to the believer when they're born again the holy spirit is building his kingdom on the inside of you he says now if you've grieved that spirit somewhere then go right back and think in your mind what did i start doing neglecting church did i start fussing with another denomination did i start picking on this one doing this to my neighbor if you did that's what sapped it out go say god i'm sorry i will go right back and make that thing right i will go right and do it again then the joy will come back to your salvation again the holy spirit just flew right up on the rafter he's ready to fly right back down again anytime you want him to come back it's not him that just gets kind of flighty we might all know people that and they're talented they're gifted they're uh wonderful wonderful brothers or sisters maybe even maybe within a natural family but you just never know where they're going to be like well i could i would count on them if i knew they were going to be there well if i knew they would show up they're more than capable and that's the holy ghost isn't just one of these people you wake up one day like where did he go where did he go he's not answering his phone he read it but he's not writing back now you just need to look in your go back in your mind and find out what you allowed what you have allowed to create the distance with your advocate what you've allowed to foster this complex that he's over there with his arms crossed mad at you you ever had that situation where two people love each other two people want to be reconciled two people hold no bitterness no animosity there's no acrimony in each person's heart towards each other but they feel that the other one does right and so they're afraid and they're timid and they're reluctant and we get that way we get that way to the towards the holy ghost and since he is a timid he's a dove brother brown even in this statement says it's the dove leading he's watching for you to have that lamb nature again and all you gotta do is just say i'm sorry he says because what have you grieved your shield what if you grieved your carrier he's the one that wants to carry you what you grieved is your protector your guide [Music] what you've grieved is your comforter you've grieved your advocate what you've done is you've impaired his ability to advocate on your behalf his advocacy is disrupted i trust i'm making myself clear i i wanted to go to that point to bring in this idea that you can grieve the advocate so that we could understand how sometimes we might feel distant but let's not place that on his legalism let's not place that on his unmitigated righteousness let's not place that on his justice let's just recognize it's it's a it's a place within our spirits that we allow ourselves to do something that we shouldn't do he said did i start fussing did i start picking did i start doing this and what happens our conscience condemns us and that creates the separation and all we have to do is say i'm sorry i i shouldn't have done that i need to make it right and all of a sudden we find the advocate saying that's the right thing that's the right thing to do i'll help you do it you know what i'm actually can start working in their hearts to make it easier on you and he advocates for you he's there waiting to advocate he's there waiting to help you you just have to want him to come back does anybody want the advocate today anybody need them to come back won't you just invite them back say lord i want you back i want your advocacy in my life i want to feel that that comfort lord even in the sense of that weighted blanket i want to feel it spiritually the teacher he's not giving you a pop quiz and see huh you don't know what brother adam said in 1957 about the tent no no pop quiz he's there to teach you what he said about it he's there to teach you what those seven thunders are he's there to teach you about the truth of the seals he's there to teach you about the godhead he's there not to quiz you to see if you'll stumble but he's there to teach you lead you guide you comfort you even protect you he's your advocate i would say this today there's someone who's never received him as an advocate if you recognize in the scripture that if you've sinned and you receive him and you'd want to receive him today acknowledging your sin i'd invite someone to give their heart to god today even to stand to their feet and say i'm going to receive you now as my advocate i'm asking that i'd be forgiven of my sins and i'm coming to you asking for the advocate to come to my aid praise the lord let us stand to our feet today lord jesus help us our gracious heavenly father you are our advocate it's so wonderful lord to not envision a scenario where we're in a courtroom where the jury is against us and the prosecuting attorney is against us and the defense attorney's against us and the judges against us but in that context you have become judge jury defending attorney against a prosecutor that is our adversary our own minds prosecute us lord it's the devil who's become our who is our adversary lord and lord it's in that wrestling [Music] it's in that fight that you become our attorney and judge and jury against an accuser and lord not only do you defend us against the lies of the accuser and defend us against the traps of this world and the voice of laodicea but you're a witness to us on the inside you are my child i love you you are forgiven you're justified you are clean you are perfected you are glorified you are sanctified how long i i i do things that i know i shouldn't do and i i i make mistakes forever son forever well how do i know you know because i'm telling you you know because i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you even in you and to the end teaching you reminding you encouraging you carrying you lord i trust that we can accept you today as an advocate as the advocate not as the world witness to the world who argues with sin and argues with the to convince the unbeliever and re judges solely judges the world because their unbelief but lord you're on the inside as the inner teacher the inner encourager the lifter of our head the one that washes our spirits from the inside the one that takes the word day by day and says this is the truth walk in it [Music] the one that every morning when we wake up has renewed your mercy wanting to remind us every morning when we're awake see daughter i've renewed his mercies for you see they're new every morning may we accept this inner encourager lord i do not say this to draw any attention to myself but lord i know that this sermon is thus saith the lord gave it to me lord you spoke in such a clear manner that i knew that this is what at least one person needed to hear they have an advocate so much lord our experience with advocacy and our experience with attorneys and our experience with the judicial system relates to this adversarial nature of it lord even myself i'm very much acquainted with the fact that i'm in a profession that is built upon adversarial representation and defending particular interest and looking out after the needs of your client it's very easy to become for it to engage in conflict and then it becomes adversarial and it becomes contentious and pride enters in and you become very defensive of certain things and can just get out of control and we kind of impose that upon our relationship with you and sense that well if the holy ghost is an advocate he's an intercessor and he's a he's a consoler that somehow he's there mediating with you to try to cop a deal with you and get us a plea agreement or probation or get us out of purgatory and lord none of that is true at all none of that is true so father i pray that we would not think today in this relationship that we have with you adversarially but to understand that you know we love you and you know that we want to keep your word know that we want a body change you know that we want healing you know that we want reconciliation you know that we want deliverance you know that we want your word and so you gave us a comforter to assure us that we can have what we need you gave us an advocate to assure us that all things are ours through jesus christ may we accept this advocate today i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen accept this advocate today just receive it received this advocacy
