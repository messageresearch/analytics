[0:00] Luke 2:ES 1-12. And it came to pass in
[0:03] those days that there went out a decree
[0:05] from Caesar Augustus that all the world
[0:07] should be taxed. And this taxing was
[0:10] first made when Sirenius was governor of
[0:12] Syria. And all went to be taxed,
[0:14] everyone into his own city. And Joseph
[0:17] also went up from Galilee out of the
[0:19] city of Nazareth into Judea under the
[0:21] city of David, which is called
[0:23] Bethlehem, because he was of the house
[0:25] and lineage of David, to be taxed with
[0:28] Mary, his espoused wife, being great
[0:30] with child. I want the homeschoolers to
[0:32] diagram that sentence before next
[0:35] Sunday. And so it was that while they
[0:37] were there, the days were accomplished
[0:39] that she should be delivered. And she
[0:42] brought forth her firstborn son, and
[0:44] wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and
[0:45] laid him in a manger, because there was
[0:47] no room for them in the end. And there
[0:50] were in the same country shepherds
[0:52] abiding in the field, keeping watch over
[0:54] their flock by night. And lo, the angel
[0:56] Lord came upon them, and the glory of
[0:58] the Lord shone round about them, and
[1:00] they were sore afraid. And the angel
[1:02] said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I
[1:04] bring you good tidings of great joy,
[1:06] which shall be to all people. For unto
[1:08] you is born, unto you is born. this day
[1:11] in the city of David, a Savior, which is
[1:14] Christ the Lord. And this shall be a
[1:17] sign unto you. Ye shall find the babe
[1:20] wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a
[1:23] manger.
[1:25] Amen. You may be seated. I'm just going
[1:27] to give you my title very quickly. And
[1:29] some of you are probably already
[1:30] wondering, did Brother Aaron just skip
[1:32] uh the the next few weeks and he's
[1:34] already preaching his Christmas sermon?
[1:37] And not that, but we're going to lean
[1:38] into it a little bit. Everybody else has
[1:40] already uh been listening to Christmas
[1:42] music for two weeks and uh and all the
[1:45] decorations have been up since Labor
[1:46] Day, but um so we might as well uh
[1:50] address the elephant in the room. It's
[1:52] Christmas season, but we do want to
[1:53] begin to look at this as sometimes we do
[1:56] seasonally, the birth of Christ. Uh the
[1:58] saying is Jesus was born on Christmas
[2:01] day. That'd be like saying you were born
[2:02] on your birthday. Uh that the day that
[2:06] Christ was born is the day that he was
[2:08] born. though they it may not have been
[2:10] December 25th and there's a lot of
[2:12] evidence to suggest that it wasn't we
[2:14] still uh recognize that there was a day
[2:16] that Christ was born. So we are kind of
[2:18] looking at some of those things and my
[2:20] title I'll come to it here in a moment
[2:21] where we introduce this more uh
[2:23] deliberately is unwrapped. So if you
[2:25] want to get that down uh before we
[2:28] continue uh the the title is unwrapped.
[2:31] This is kind of a foundational sermon
[2:33] for the last uh few sermons that we'll
[2:35] be preaching this year before the year
[2:37] ends. And I'm looking at as we have all
[2:40] year long through this subject of art.
[2:41] I've been looking at what Christ looks
[2:44] like. Uh how does he what does he look
[2:47] like today? And it was what was inspired
[2:49] to me originally is thinking about how
[2:52] there was a time when the artist is who
[2:56] we relied upon to know what a period
[2:58] looked like, what something felt like or
[3:00] what was happening. You needed a writer
[3:02] to write a story. You needed a painter
[3:04] to paint a picture. Uh now we can just
[3:07] record it as it's happening and as it is
[3:09] and you can interpret things as you see
[3:10] it for yourself. But if you were going
[3:12] to know uh what a king looked like, his
[3:15] portrait was painted for others to see
[3:17] him. If you wanted to know what the city
[3:19] would look like, someone would paint
[3:21] that or maybe they would describe it
[3:22] through words. So, we have been thinking
[3:24] about what does Christ look like today?
[3:27] What is this that representation? And
[3:29] so, as we have a few more services
[3:31] before this year is over, several more
[3:33] services, I want to begin to look at the
[3:35] portrait of Jesus Christ, even thinking
[3:37] what do we see? What does he look like?
[3:39] What do what are we looked at to
[3:40] understand who he is and and how he
[3:43] appears? In Psalms 27:4, this is one of
[3:46] the original scriptures we begin to use
[3:48] at the beginning of the year. One thing
[3:49] have I desired of the Lord, that will I
[3:53] seek after. I believe for two years now
[3:54] as we spoke on the house of the Lord,
[3:56] this was very prominent. That will I
[3:58] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[4:01] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[4:03] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[4:05] inquire in his temple. Very uh it sounds
[4:09] like David knows what he's looking for
[4:11] that he has some idea of what he wants.
[4:13] This one thing have I desired and desire
[4:16] in this one thing. I'm going to seek
[4:18] after this thing that I desire and it's
[4:20] to dwell in the house of the Lord. Not
[4:22] just momentarily but all the days of his
[4:24] life. Then they say to behold the beauty
[4:27] of the Lord. He wants to see he wants to
[4:29] gaze upon he wants to take in God's
[4:32] beauty and to inquire to seek to to uh
[4:36] to investigate
[4:38] to examine in his temple. So the
[4:42] question could be or this is the
[4:44] question I want to pose as I was
[4:45] thinking about it this past week is what
[4:47] is David referring to when he says that
[4:49] I want to behold the beauty of the Lord.
[4:52] What was he thinking? How how could that
[4:54] beauty be seen? What was it that David
[4:57] was expecting uh to do or to see when he
[5:00] did it? How would he seek uh and how
[5:02] would he see beauty? In verse 8, Psalms
[5:06] 27:8, I think I actually had of a typo
[5:09] here. May maybe I don't. It's just in my
[5:11] notes. Good. I got it right here. But in
[5:12] my notes, I typed 26, but it's 27:8.
[5:16] What? When thou saidest, God said, "Seek
[5:19] ye my face." My heart said, I want you
[5:22] to recognize how this is something in
[5:24] his heart first. Something God's word
[5:26] spoken, then in his heart, his heart
[5:28] said, "Thy face, Lord, will I seek." So,
[5:30] it had to be something first in his
[5:32] heart. The word is spoken and then
[5:34] something in his heart responds, "Lord,
[5:36] I will seek your face." So having first
[5:38] been instigated in his heart, then he
[5:41] can have this expectation of seeing his
[5:43] face and then when he sees his face,
[5:45] it'll answer to what was in his heart.
[5:49] So to seek, it's more than just a a
[5:51] passing glance, but he wants to I want
[5:53] to behold your face. I will seek your
[5:56] face. Now, this is um an interesting
[5:59] proclamation by David to say, I want to
[6:01] behold the beauty of the Lord. And that
[6:03] God would say, seek my face. And then
[6:06] David says,"Well then your face will I
[6:08] seek." Because in Exodus 33 18-23,
[6:13] Moses says,"Lord, show me your glory."
[6:16] He wanted to see, remember the radiance
[6:18] of one's countenance, the light of one's
[6:20] countenance to the face and what it
[6:22] represents and to behold his face and
[6:24] how it declares presence and character.
[6:26] So he says, "Show me your glory." He
[6:28] said, "I want to see who you are." And
[6:31] he said, 'I will make all my goodness,
[6:32] God said, pass before thee, and I will
[6:35] proclaim the name of the Lord before
[6:36] thee, and will be gracious to whom I
[6:37] will be gracious, and show mercy on whom
[6:39] I will show mercy. And he said, "Thou
[6:42] cannot see my face, for there shall no
[6:45] man see me and live." Now, I want you to
[6:48] think about this in light of what David
[6:49] wanted to do. David is saying, "I want
[6:51] to see your face. I want to behold your
[6:54] beauty." And then God says, "Seek my
[6:55] face." And God is telling him, "Seek my
[6:57] face." And David says, "Well, then your
[6:59] face I'll seek." But to Moses, he said,
[7:00] "No man could see it and live."
[7:03] &gt;&gt; So if you say, "I want to see the face
[7:04] of the Lord." You say, "Man, do you have
[7:05] a death wish?" Because it would mean
[7:07] death to do so.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Behold, there is a
[7:11] place by me, and thou shalt stand upon
[7:13] the rock, and will cover thee with my
[7:15] hand while I pass by, and I'll take away
[7:18] my hand, and thou shalt see my back
[7:19] parts, but my face shall not be seen."
[7:23] I I mentioned this just to think just to
[7:26] get you to think more deeply about what
[7:28] David is asking for when he says,"I want
[7:30] to see your face. I want to behold your
[7:32] beauty." And so the Lord says, "Seek my
[7:34] face." And my heart says it happens in
[7:36] the heart. Your face then will I seek. I
[7:39] will seek your face. And there's a time
[7:41] when God is saying if you you can't see
[7:43] my face. To see my face is certain
[7:46] death. But yet David is wanting to seek
[7:48] God's face. So what did it mean when he
[7:51] said, 'I want to seek your face.' I know
[7:53] for us, you say, 'Well, let me let me
[7:55] see your face. Then we we expect to see
[7:58] someone's face and and physical features
[8:00] and and for it to be pronounced in a
[8:02] certain way that we know, I'm looking at
[8:04] their face. I'm not looking at the back
[8:05] of their head. I'm not looking at their
[8:07] foot. I'm looking at their face. So what
[8:08] did it mean to David? He says, I want to
[8:10] behold your beauty. Did he expect to
[8:13] find a physical person behind the veil
[8:16] and there he'd be standing and he could
[8:17] look at his face and he could touch him
[8:19] and he feel them? What was David
[8:20] expecting to see? How was this going to
[8:23] happen? Then we've been reading quite a
[8:26] bit this uh these last couple months in
[8:28] 2 Corinthians chapter 3 18.
[8:31] [clears throat] But we all with open
[8:33] face beholding as in a mirror as in a
[8:35] glass the glory of the Lord. So we're
[8:38] going to see Christ. We're going to see
[8:41] his face. the glory of the Lord. This is
[8:43] what David wanted to behold. The beauty
[8:45] of the Lord. This is what he was to seek
[8:47] after. This is what Moses asked to see.
[8:51] This is what God said, "No man could see
[8:53] me fully and live. But now he says, we
[8:55] see in a glass the glory of the Lord."
[8:57] And by that image, we're changed into
[8:59] the same image from glory to glory, even
[9:01] as by the spirit of the Lord. So gazing
[9:04] upon, beholding, seeking and seeing and
[9:07] not just glancing at it, but really
[9:09] taking it in this unobstructed view of
[9:12] his face will bring out the same image
[9:15] in us. If we're only seeing him in
[9:18] partial light, we can only express in
[9:19] partial light. If we are only seeing him
[9:22] in partial character, we're only going
[9:23] to develop impartial character. But as
[9:25] he becomes unobstructed, as he can shine
[9:28] in his fullness, the more that that can
[9:30] impact us and change us.
[9:34] I I want to make reference to this and
[9:36] so I will since I want to I will I have
[9:39] always enjoyed kind of those introd
[9:44] and so I would like to deal with this
[9:46] for a moment and so I will and because I
[9:49] would like to I'm stuck in a loop but
[9:52] today in the time that we're living in
[9:54] now our our attention and appreciation
[9:57] is stretched so thin imagine how many
[10:00] times a day you have to say you like
[10:02] something or follow something or thumbs
[10:04] up something or write back to a really
[10:06] really really long heartfelt compliment
[10:08] K, right? You have to respond so you
[10:10] just say K in lowercase and uh and so
[10:13] there's we're just stretched so thin and
[10:16] there seems to be not that um we have an
[10:19] attention deficit. I was looking into it
[10:21] and studying it. There's some Has
[10:22] anybody heard uh about the study that
[10:25] said the average human attention span is
[10:27] 8 seconds? Has anybody heard that? We
[10:29] immediately think about the rodeo. Well,
[10:31] it's they've misconstrued the studies
[10:33] and you could probably thank Microsoft
[10:35] for that. But it's not that our
[10:37] attention spans have decreased, but
[10:39] really what it is is that we have so
[10:42] many distractions
[10:44] &gt;&gt; that we have the ability uh to focus. We
[10:47] have it's more than 8 seconds. But what
[10:50] it is is that there's other things we
[10:51] can move on to.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; There's other things begging our
[10:54] attention and and there's other things
[10:56] that are trying to get in the way. And
[10:59] so there's an infinite number of
[11:00] distractions. That's why I advocate for
[11:02] if you're going to read your Bible, do
[11:03] it on this. If there's a popup
[11:06] notification when you're reading this,
[11:08] it's called Revelation and it comes from
[11:10] God, right? Like you don't have to worry
[11:13] about, oh my goodness, Drake just
[11:16] dropped a new album, right? And shame on
[11:19] you for getting that notification.
[11:23] But there is a certain uh
[11:26] representation.
[11:28] there's a certain distraction and
[11:30] certain things that press in on our
[11:31] attention
[11:33] a a and and try to grab us and so we
[11:36] have the capacity to give focus to
[11:39] things but there's attention and even
[11:41] our appreciation is being stretched so
[11:43] so thin
[11:45] &gt;&gt; don't know if anybody of you took her
[11:48] class when you were at Harvard but the
[11:50] professor Jennifer Roberts she's teaches
[11:52] art history at Harvard and uh brother
[11:54] Anthony you're thinking man how many
[11:56] Harvard grads are in this church. Um,
[11:58] have you met all the doctors here yet?
[12:01] Uh, she has a requirement in her art
[12:03] history class for her students to choose
[12:06] one work of art. It could be a
[12:07] sculpture, could be a painting, but it
[12:08] has to be a work of art and spend three
[12:11] hours looking at it.
[12:14] And she calls it and it the concept is
[12:17] called immersive attention where you
[12:20] slow down and you wait. The New York
[12:23] Times kind of piggybacking off of that a
[12:24] couple years ago came up with spend 10
[12:26] minutes looking at this and I signed up
[12:29] for the notifications like what a great
[12:30] idea and now for the last two years I've
[12:32] been notified of dozens of pieces of art
[12:34] that you're to spend 10 minutes looking
[12:36] at and you could probably add it all up
[12:38] and I haven't spent 10 minutes looking
[12:39] at all those pieces of art.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; But it's to slow down. The Bible says be
[12:44] still and know like you just don't know.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; But you have to be still first.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Be still. calm yourself, slow down and
[12:54] know that I am the Lord. And so this
[12:56] cont context to immersive attention is
[12:58] that you slow down and wait. And this
[13:00] professor made the comment that I
[13:01] thought was extremely enlightening.
[13:03] Every external pressure, social and
[13:05] technological, is pushing students in
[13:08] the other direction toward immediacy,
[13:11] rapidity, and spontaneity.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; And this is what our young people are
[13:15] facing and our youth, our children. This
[13:17] is what the next generation is being
[13:19] immersed in. is not attention, but
[13:22] rather immediiacy, things being very,
[13:23] very quick, the spontaneity of things.
[13:26] And it's an external pressure socially
[13:28] and through technology that's pushing us
[13:30] away from slowing down and waiting,
[13:34] &gt;&gt; being still, and knowing to the
[13:36] immediiacy of something. And what this
[13:38] connects to and where the danger is,
[13:40] because remember, I'm not uh I'm not
[13:41] giving the cliff notes for an art
[13:43] history class. I'm speaking about
[13:44] spiritual things. And when David said,
[13:46] "Your face will I seek,
[13:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to seek after." God said seek
[13:50] my face. He didn't say see my face. He
[13:53] said seek my face. And there is and that
[13:57] there must be uh some gazing upon
[14:01] beholding. We all beholding in a glass
[14:05] are changed. That there is this common
[14:08] misconception
[14:09] that vision is immediate.
[14:12] That when we see something it's just
[14:13] this it feels very simple. It feels
[14:15] direct. It feels instant.
[14:18] But there's uh be something being
[14:21] available instantly by sight doesn't
[14:24] mean it's instantly available to your
[14:26] consciousness.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; Because we see something that's so
[14:31] instant and our eyes and the way that
[14:33] the optics work, it's just fascinating.
[14:36] I think if you just studied the eye or
[14:37] even the ear and to think that that just
[14:39] evolved
[14:41] uh that takes more faith to believe that
[14:43] uh than it does to believe that a higher
[14:45] power supernatural god designed it and
[14:47] it was the architect of it. But there is
[14:49] this misconception that well because I
[14:51] see things instantly I know things
[14:53] instantly. But that's not true.
[14:56] In any work of art there are details and
[14:59] orders and relationships that take time
[15:03] to perceive.
[15:05] So we could say just because you looked
[15:07] at something doesn't mean you've seen
[15:09] it.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Just because you've looked at something
[15:13] doesn't mean you've seen it.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Access is not synonymous with learning.
[15:19] Just because you have access to
[15:20] something, anybody ever heard of the
[15:22] Kodak effect?
[15:24] And how many of you can have all your a
[15:26] bunch of phone numbers memorized? Well,
[15:28] the Kodak effect is that if you take a
[15:31] picture of something, you're least
[15:32] likely to retain it in your memory
[15:34] because your brain tells you there's a
[15:35] photo of it
[15:37] &gt;&gt; and you know that it's been cataloged.
[15:39] It's been archived. And so, we have 1.2
[15:43] Brazilian screenshots in our phones of
[15:46] things that we want to remember. And and
[15:48] then we how many and some of them are
[15:49] duplicates because we keep saying, "I
[15:51] want to remember that. I need to
[15:52] remember that." And so the Kodak effect
[15:54] is that YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY
[15:56] retain it because it's recorded
[15:59] somewhere else. And so having access to
[16:02] something doesn't mean you understand
[16:03] it.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Having having these things available
[16:08] doesn't mean learning. And so I I really
[16:11] want to challenge you to give sincere uh
[16:14] attention to this principle
[16:17] of seeing seeing Christ.
[16:20] So today my title is unwrapped.
[16:24] If you if you wrap something, it's
[16:25] enveloped. And I want you to even take
[16:27] in this image as we've used it here.
[16:31] And to wrap something is to surround it
[16:33] or to cover it as we see here presented
[16:36] in this picture. It's this fine cloth
[16:38] that's used as a cover. And I'm using an
[16:41] image of what would be a a a type of
[16:43] Japanese textile art
[16:46] where ferroshokei ferah feriki I'm not
[16:50] Japanese ferosiki it's this art of
[16:54] wrapping gifts in reusable cloths
[16:58] and so in doing so there are certain
[16:59] things that are represented even in the
[17:01] cloth and it holds symbolic meaning it
[17:02] means that you've cared for this you've
[17:04] shown respect I've always felt very very
[17:06] bad for my wife when it comes to
[17:08] Christmas time because she is just an
[17:10] expert, a professional in wrapping
[17:13] gifts. Everything's neat and clean and
[17:14] beautiful and there's ribbons and
[17:16] there's name cards and then all her
[17:18] gifts look as if you know I wrapped
[17:21] them, right? Just folded over and duct
[17:23] taped and put in a grocery sack. Uh and
[17:27] so there's but when you take time to
[17:29] wrap a gift that that means something to
[17:32] itself
[17:33] and in this Japanese art it's actually
[17:35] considered part of the gift because it
[17:37] represents it's symbolic. The wrapping
[17:39] becomes symbolic
[17:41] &gt;&gt; because it is part of the gift. So in
[17:44] Luke 2 6 and 7 it says and so it was
[17:47] that while they were there the days were
[17:49] accomplished that she should be
[17:50] delivered. Mary having received
[17:53] conceived by the Holy Ghost the Messiah
[17:56] Jesus the son of God that was to come
[17:58] into the world. It says she brought
[18:00] forth her firstborn son. Think about the
[18:03] the portrait that's being painted. We we
[18:06] we are not seeing it ourselves. So we
[18:08] have to allow the writers to kind of
[18:12] paint this picture through the use of
[18:13] their words. And she brought forth she
[18:16] gave birth to Jesus her firstborn son
[18:19] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[18:22] laid him in a manger because there was
[18:25] no room for them in the end in her
[18:28] firstborn son Jesus Christ. We know
[18:31] according to scripture we could even use
[18:32] John 3:16 that God gave his only
[18:34] begotten son. This is God's gift
[18:37] according to prophecy, according to
[18:38] scripture. And as this image of the
[18:41] birth of Christ is painted, we see these
[18:44] different elements. She brings him
[18:45] forth. She wraps him in swaddling
[18:47] clothes and lays him in a manger. In
[18:51] Psalms 127:3, it says, "Lo, children are
[18:53] inheritage of the Lord, and the fruit of
[18:56] the womb is his reward. Heritage is an
[18:57] inheritance or a portion, a share.
[19:00] Reward is even a a wage paid or
[19:02] something given. Children are a gift
[19:04] from God. It's even why I when the woman
[19:08] Eve said, "I have gotten a child from
[19:10] the Lord." It's not that the child was
[19:12] born of God, but rather all life comes
[19:14] from God.
[19:16] And so she wrapped, notice this picture,
[19:18] this portrait of the birth of Christ.
[19:20] She wrapped in swaddling clothes Jesus
[19:24] and laid him in a manger. These are
[19:26] important details to the observer. We're
[19:29] not just being told Jesus was born on
[19:31] this day. We're being told details. Why
[19:33] would God even want these details
[19:35] shared? Because just as the wrapping
[19:38] should give some indication of the care
[19:40] and the respect and the thoughtfulness a
[19:43] and in this in in certain cultures, the
[19:45] wrapping is actually part of the gift
[19:47] that is reusable that signifies
[19:49] something here. Christ is wrapped
[19:52] &gt;&gt; in swaddling clothes. Ezekiel chapter
[19:55] 16:es 1:5 again the word of the Lord
[19:57] came unto me saying son of man cause
[20:00] Jerusalem to know her abominations and
[20:02] say thus sayith the Lord God unto
[20:04] Jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is
[20:07] of the land of Canaan and thy father was
[20:09] an Amorite and thy mother an Hittite.
[20:13] And as for thy nativity in the day thou
[20:15] was born thy neaval was not cut. So
[20:17] think about how uh descriptive this
[20:20] birth is. Neither was thou washed in
[20:22] water to supplee. Thou was not salted at
[20:26] all, nor swaddled at all. It continues
[20:29] to describe this abandonment, this
[20:31] rejection at birth. None I apped thee to
[20:33] do any of these unto thee to have
[20:35] compassion upon thee, but thou was cast
[20:36] out into an open field to the loathing
[20:38] of thy person in the day that thou was
[20:40] bore. That's quite a shocking statement
[20:44] in giving this representation the word
[20:46] of the Lord saying this is the
[20:47] abominations of Jerusalem. You have been
[20:49] cast aside by your father and mother.
[20:52] You've been disregarded. You have not
[20:54] been cared for. And it references these
[20:57] simple acts that would have been taken
[20:59] place that were traditional that all
[21:01] babies would have received at the time
[21:02] of their birth. Their uh and biblical
[21:05] cord would have been cut. Thy naval was
[21:07] not cut. you were washed or so you had
[21:09] been washed with water and then actually
[21:12] salted. These are all things that would
[21:14] be done to a newborn and then swaddled
[21:17] as even the the scripture refers to as
[21:19] she brought forth her son and swaddled
[21:21] him, took these strips and and wrapped
[21:24] him and snuggled him close. This is
[21:26] something you would do when you gave
[21:27] care. There's a lot of history and
[21:29] tradition. Uh, and brother Brandham
[21:32] makes reference to it quite a bit that
[21:33] and so he said it was written somewhere
[21:35] and he read somewhere that she just had
[21:37] to use what was available that perhaps
[21:39] it was a rag that had been used as a
[21:41] buffer between a a yolk on an oxen and
[21:44] the oxen itself. So there's a lot of
[21:46] imagery and a lot of things you could
[21:48] think, but we could say for certain that
[21:50] as a mother, she would have wanted to
[21:52] wash him, salt him, and swaddle him and
[21:55] give care to him, to pity him, to have
[21:58] compassion, to nurture him.
[22:02] And as Christ is born, this is something
[22:04] that's just been I I've been kind of
[22:07] tracking this down and trying to see
[22:10] this as much as I possibly can. The the
[22:13] glory of God in Jesus Christ is found in
[22:17] his similarities to humanity rather than
[22:20] his differences. This is what's becoming
[22:23] more and more profound to me. You say,
[22:25] "Oh, well, he was conceived of a virgin
[22:28] h and he brought forth." But then you
[22:30] say, "Well, that's none of us have come
[22:32] that way, but he's still come. He's born
[22:35] just like all of us were born."
[22:38] &gt;&gt; And so here in this instant of his
[22:39] birth, it's not much more different than
[22:41] any others. And it's these similarities
[22:43] that reveal the mysteries of Christ.
[22:47] So as we have opportunity maybe through
[22:49] the next few services, I'd like for us
[22:51] to view Christ from different angles
[22:55] to do so with more depth. See this
[22:57] picture of Christ and even his birth.
[23:00] Because the Bible says in 1 John 3:2,
[23:02] "Beloved, now are we the sons of God."
[23:05] And it does not yet appear what we shall
[23:07] be, but we know that when he shall
[23:11] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[23:13] shall see him as he is. To me, this fits
[23:16] perfectly with we all with open face,
[23:18] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[23:19] Lord, are changed into the same image.
[23:22] That as he makes himself known, as he
[23:24] reveals himself, we can become what he's
[23:26] revealed. That's that's how that you
[23:29] receive salvation is he reveals himself
[23:30] to you as a savior. When he reveals
[23:32] himself to you as a savior, you become
[23:34] saved. When he reveals himself to you as
[23:35] a healer, you become healed. And so we
[23:37] shall be like him when we see him as he
[23:39] is.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; And it's not just this sight being
[23:44] available to sight, but it being
[23:46] available to our consciousness to be
[23:48] still and know
[23:50] &gt;&gt; where we give some sort of immersive
[23:52] attention. We we consider it. We look at
[23:54] it. We find it. We find where he is. And
[23:56] I'm saying being satisfied that oh
[23:57] Christ is revealed in his word or oh
[23:59] Christ's presence is felt in church or
[24:01] these things are true about Christ that
[24:03] there's a way that we would look into it
[24:05] to discover him and to know him so that
[24:08] we can be changed to be like him.
[24:11] So just as this time as Mary has given
[24:13] birth to the Messiah, she takes him and
[24:16] she wraps him. The Bible in Luke and
[24:18] this account in Luke says she wraps him
[24:20] in swaddling clothes and lays him in a
[24:23] manger.
[24:25] Then in verse 8 it says, ' And there
[24:26] were in the same country shepherds
[24:27] abiding in the field keeping watch over
[24:29] their flock by night. There's a lot of
[24:32] uh rich symbolism here. And lo, the
[24:35] angel of the Lord came upon them, and
[24:36] the glory of the Lord shone round about
[24:37] them, and they were sore afraid.
[24:40] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[24:42] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[24:46] great joy, which shall be to all people.
[24:48] For unto you is born this day in the
[24:52] city of David a savior which is Christ
[24:55] the Lord.
[24:58] The hopes of a thousand generations
[25:02] was spoken in this one sentence. All the
[25:05] hopes of Abraham, all the promise in
[25:08] Isaac, all the aspirations of the
[25:11] priesthood, all the representations and
[25:14] forms AND SYMBOLS OF THE SACRIFICE and
[25:17] the temple. This is what identified
[25:20] Israel. And in one sentence, the angel
[25:23] saying, "It's finished. It's it's here.
[25:25] Everything you've longed for, everything
[25:26] that makes you who you are
[25:29] that you've why you wanted to be in
[25:31] Palestine, why you CLAIM THIS AS YOUR
[25:33] PROMISED LAND, WHY YOU CLAIM TO BE
[25:34] DIFFERENT PEOPLE BECAUSE UNTO YOU WILL
[25:36] BE BORN A savior
[25:38] and here he is born
[25:42] and you should think about all these
[25:44] incredible promises that are going to be
[25:46] that are mentioned of him. So it says,
[25:48] "And this shall be a sign unto you."
[25:50] Because if you put yourself in the shoes
[25:52] of these shepherds who would have been
[25:53] uh at least understanding and
[25:56] knowledgeable of these great promises of
[25:57] the Messiah said, "This shall be a sign
[25:59] unto you." I think this is the angels
[26:02] now recalibrating their expectations
[26:04] because we're going to see the Messiah.
[26:09] And there may have been certain
[26:11] expectations according to their
[26:12] tradition, what they're going to see. So
[26:14] it says, "This is how you're going to
[26:15] know it's him." And listen to what's so
[26:17] remarkable. You shall find the babe
[26:19] wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a
[26:21] manger.
[26:24] Wait, what?
[26:27] A a a hollowedout uh dwelling for
[26:29] animals, maybe out of a cave. I I I'm
[26:32] going to find him lying in a manger.
[26:35] I'm going to find him wrapped in
[26:36] swaddling clothes. In other words, he
[26:39] wouldn't have looked much different.
[26:40] Maybe the location seems odd, but given
[26:42] the time period and the influx of
[26:44] people, maybe it would be expected that
[26:46] not everyone would have lodging. As
[26:48] people begin to travel more, there's
[26:49] more and more ins that were open and
[26:51] different ways that people were welcomed
[26:53] in to stay at other people's homes. A
[26:55] and so that might have been
[26:56] understandable that at this time of
[26:59] increased travel that some not everybody
[27:01] would have a place to stay. So he SAYS,
[27:03] "YOU'LL FIND THEM WRAPPED IN SWADDLING
[27:04] CLOTHES LINE in a manger." And he says
[27:06] this is going to be a sign to you.
[27:10] It's a contrast. I believe that the
[27:12] angels say this. It's going to and say
[27:14] this because there's going to be
[27:15] contrast between the expectation that
[27:17] they would have had according to
[27:18] prophecy and the reality according to
[27:20] the fulfillment or the fulfillment of
[27:22] the reality of it that all these things
[27:25] and THESE PROMISES OF A MESSIAH COMING.
[27:27] BUT NOW THAT HE'S COME what did they
[27:29] expect in Micah 5:2? But thou Bethlehem
[27:32] Epherta, thou though thou be little
[27:35] among the thousands of Judah, yet out of
[27:37] thee shall come forth unto me that is to
[27:39] be ruler in Israel. Here's the promise
[27:42] of the Messiah. Here it's happening in
[27:44] the city of David in Bethlehem Epherta.
[27:47] Here comes the ruler OF ISRAEL WHOSE
[27:49] GOING FORTH HAVE BEEN FROM OF OLD FROM
[27:51] EVERLASTING.
[27:53] You're going to find a ruler who is go
[27:56] whose ways have been old FOR OLD H
[28:00] ALWAYS BEEN AND will always be AN
[28:03] ETERNAL EVERLASTING ruler and you will
[28:06] find the babe.
[28:09] Notice just how much it's going to be a
[28:11] sign to you. This is what you're
[28:12] expecting, but this is what you'll find.
[28:15] So many scriptures we can use in Isaiah
[28:17] chapter 9 verse 6. For unto you a child
[28:19] is born. almost mirroring exactly what
[28:22] the angel said that I bring you good
[28:25] tidings for unto you is born this day
[28:27] Christ
[28:29] for unto us a child is born unto us a
[28:31] son is given this is the gift of Jesus
[28:33] Christ this is the wrapped gift of God
[28:36] YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A BABE ONE day and
[28:39] the government shall be upon his
[28:40] shoulder
[28:42] you're looking for a mantle you're
[28:44] looking for a royal robe you're looking
[28:45] for a scepter of righteousness you're
[28:48] looking FOR POWER IN HIS NAME SHALL BE
[28:50] CALLED WONDERFUL.
[28:52] Some translations render run wonderful
[28:54] counselor.
[28:56] I like to think that this is a nod to
[28:57] lawyers counselor. WONDERFUL COUNSELOR.
[29:00] THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER,
[29:02] THE PRINCE of peace. Think of this
[29:05] royalty that is being given being
[29:07] attributed. The picture that's PAINTED
[29:08] IN ISAIAH 9, THE PICTURE PAINTED IN
[29:10] MICAH 5. BUT NOW WHEN IT'S BEING
[29:12] FULFILLED, THE WRITER BEGINS TO PAINT
[29:14] THIS PICTURE OF MIND AND HE IS WRAPPED
[29:16] in swaddling clothes lying in a manger.
[29:21] This will be a sign unto you. You will
[29:24] find the Messiah
[29:26] laying as a child, a baby, a newborn,
[29:30] wrapped and swaddled as any other
[29:32] newborn maybe common newborn would be
[29:35] lying in a manger.
[29:38] And suddenly, it says in verse 13,
[29:40] "Suddenly, there was with the angel a
[29:42] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[29:43] God, saying,"Glory to God in the
[29:45] highest, and on earth peace, goodwill
[29:46] toward men. And it came to pass as the
[29:49] angels are gone away from them into
[29:51] heaven. The shepherds said one to
[29:52] another, "Let us go even, let us now go
[29:56] even unto Bethlehem."
[29:58] Now, um, just bear with pray for me. I,
[30:03] um, hurt my back this past week or
[30:06] triggered. I'm 50 years old, so every
[30:07] day is just like walking on thin ice.
[30:10] You never know when you're going to
[30:11] sneeze and not be able to straighten
[30:13] yourself back up. And you're thinking,
[30:15] man, at 50? Yeah, 50.
[30:20] Goodness gracious. So, I'm having uh
[30:23] pain and spasms right now. So, if all of
[30:25] a sudden I twist into a pretzel, it's
[30:27] not by way of miracle, it's by way of
[30:30] sciatic pain.
[30:34] I think they was originally someone
[30:36] trying to spell psychotic pain the
[30:39] psychotica and they misspelled it and it
[30:42] became sciatica.
[30:44] It says let us go even now go even unto
[30:46] Bethlehem and see
[30:49] this thing which has come to pass which
[30:52] the Lord hath made known unto us. So God
[30:56] has a way of making something known unto
[30:57] you. because it has been presented to
[30:59] you audibly or visually because there's
[31:01] something that you can begin to conceive
[31:03] IN YOUR MIND. NOW, LET ME GO SEE.
[31:06] The psalmist says, "LET US TASTE and
[31:08] see." There's something a more immersive
[31:11] experience that he wants you to have.
[31:12] AND THEY CAME WITH HASTE AND found Mary
[31:14] and Joseph and the babe lying in a
[31:17] manger just exactly as the angel said.
[31:20] They found the Savior, Christ the Lord,
[31:24] wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a
[31:27] manger. And when they had seen it, so
[31:29] now they've seen it with their own eyes.
[31:31] Some may HEAR THE ANGELS PROCLAIM,
[31:33] "THERE IS A SAVIOR BORN IN BETHLEHEM AND
[31:36] HE'S WRAPPED IN SWADDLING CLOTHES AND
[31:38] HE'S THE MESSIAH." AND THEN THEY
[31:39] IMMEDIATELY TAKE THE ANGEL'S WORDS FOR
[31:41] IT AND THEY RUN OUT AND they tell
[31:43] everyone what's happened. But these
[31:45] shepherds had this instinct TO SAY, "LET
[31:47] US GO AND SEE.
[31:50] DID THEY NOT HAVE EVERY reason to
[31:51] believe that the report was true?
[31:54] Because immediately when they're told
[31:55] that the babe is born, this is the
[31:57] Messiah, HE'S WRAPPED IN SWADDLING
[31:59] CLOTHES, AND he's lying in a manger, and
[32:01] then all the heaven is filled with these
[32:02] hosts singing glory to God in the
[32:04] highest. THE SUPERNATURAL WEIGHT OF
[32:07] THAT, they could have immediately uh
[32:11] posted on X. They could have immediately
[32:14] begin to uh send reals out on Instagram
[32:16] or I don't know if IT'S FAKE. I DON'T
[32:17] know who does the reals and who does
[32:19] what. I know Snapchat does snaps. Do you
[32:21] do Instas on Instagram? Do you do grams
[32:23] on Insta
[32:25] or milliliters? I There's all these
[32:27] different things. I I'm just saying that
[32:29] somehow someway they're publishing these
[32:31] things without having seen it. But they
[32:34] go to see it.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; And when they had seen it, this is verse
[32:39] 17. When they had seen it, they made
[32:40] known abroad the same which was told
[32:42] them concerning this child because they
[32:44] now there's been something that they
[32:46] seen. If I could go ahead and get ahead
[32:47] of myself a little bit, that there was
[32:51] truth in the proclamation
[32:54] that to that presented to them this
[32:56] truth in this image. But now the image
[32:59] had been unwrapped,
[33:01] &gt;&gt; it was no longer just words. It was no
[33:02] longer description. But now when they
[33:04] went and they had seen it, now they saw
[33:06] the swaddling clothes. They saw the
[33:08] manger. They saw Mary and Joseph. They
[33:10] saw the scene. They're able to they're
[33:13] able to take in much more than just the
[33:16] truth of what the angels had said.
[33:20] They went and told everyone told the
[33:23] saying abroad and all that they had
[33:25] heard it wonder and all they that heard
[33:28] it wondered at those things which were
[33:29] told them by the shepherds.
[33:32] But Mary kept all these things and
[33:34] pondered them in her heart. And the
[33:36] shepherds returned glorifying and
[33:38] praising God for all the things that
[33:39] they had heard and seen as it was told
[33:43] unto them. Think how wonderful that is
[33:46] is that the angel of the Lord tells them
[33:49] what is
[33:51] and they are picking up what he's laying
[33:53] down. So they go see what he said. Can
[33:56] we not put ourselves in the same boat
[33:58] that there's a lot of things maybe that
[33:59] could be said even if you just take it
[34:01] as a an angel of the Lord who would
[34:02] preach the gospel and the gospel's
[34:03] preached like that's nothing but the
[34:05] truth. But do you realize as the truth
[34:06] is preached and it's available to you in
[34:08] your ears and in your mind that you want
[34:10] to see that for yourself?
[34:14] &gt;&gt; That there's an opening up and an
[34:15] unfolding of the word of God to you
[34:17] where you can now be immersed in that.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; For they had seen what they WERE TOLD.
[34:22] THEY SAW MICAH 5:2. They saw Isaiah 9:6.
[34:27] They saw him as he was.
[34:30] not prophecy,
[34:33] not even history, but in a present
[34:34] reality.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I could say this today, we're
[34:38] not going to see him wrapped in
[34:40] swaddling clothes line in the manger.
[34:42] But to them, the present reality of the
[34:44] Messiah was just that
[34:47] the pictures painted by the prophets
[34:48] could have easily been misunderstood.
[34:52] Surely, it was, as you could see, that
[34:53] he came unto his own, and his own
[34:55] received not. despite all the many
[34:56] prophecies that he's fulfilling, many of
[34:59] them were not known until it had been
[35:00] fulfilled.
[35:02] Could be said that for shepherds to find
[35:04] their Messiah in a manger
[35:08] wrapped in swaddling clothes could have
[35:11] uh as one one writer put it, scandalized
[35:14] them.
[35:15] That I've believed I've believed in the
[35:18] Messiah. This is what I believe. And
[35:20] then someone grabs them and says, "Hey,
[35:21] come here. I want to show you something.
[35:22] You believe in a Messiah?" and they say,
[35:24] "This is your Messiah right here." And
[35:28] they say, "That's that fulfills Micah 5.
[35:32] That fulfills Isaiah 9:6.
[35:36] This is the fulfillment of it." Oh, what
[35:39] is this anyways? What is it we've been
[35:42] promised
[35:44] perhaps even to the point to where they
[35:46] said, "Well, this is the way it looks
[35:47] like. I don't want it." Would have lost
[35:49] their faith and confidence in it. God
[35:52] sends this great vindication and the
[35:53] angels warned them ahead of time what to
[35:56] expect, what to look for and how to know
[35:58] him because it would have been very
[35:59] difficult otherwise for them just to
[36:01] kind of be moving the herds through
[36:02] Bethlehem that day. And someone nearby
[36:05] saying, "Man, did I think the Messiah
[36:07] was just born in that carved out cave
[36:10] over there with the oxen and the sheep
[36:12] and the goats and all that. That woman
[36:13] over there just gave birth to the
[36:14] Messiah." Said, "Yeah, buddy. I don't
[36:17] know what you've been drinking."
[36:20] But they were told ahead of time.
[36:23] And it was in this humility and this
[36:25] simplicity that he came in.
[36:29] And the angels are telling him ahead of
[36:31] time, don't look for something so great.
[36:34] Don't don't expect a certain veneer or
[36:36] certain uh sheen to be put on this. See
[36:40] it for what it is.
[36:43] Think about this over the next few weeks
[36:45] and during this time of year just how
[36:47] that when Christ was on earth, he
[36:48] distinguished himself more so by his
[36:51] humanity and his humiliation than he did
[36:52] even by his miracles.
[36:56] He distinguished himself by being
[36:57] relatable yet being the son of God.
[37:03] And so in Isaiah 53:es 1:3, this is
[37:06] maybe a different side as we read about
[37:07] one who is a ruler in Israel who's going
[37:10] forth from old and from everlasting and
[37:12] the government is upon his shoulder. His
[37:13] name's wonderful counselor, mighty God,
[37:15] everlasting father, prince of peace. You
[37:17] would expect to see somebody
[37:19] well represented, something who when you
[37:22] see it like, oh my goodness, what a
[37:24] heartthrob. It says, "Who hath believed
[37:26] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[37:28] Lord revealed?
[37:30] WHO HAS FAITH, WHO BELIEVES, and how to
[37:33] whom has God's power been revealed and
[37:35] made known. FOR HE SHALL GROW UP BEFORE
[37:37] HIM as a tender plant. This is the
[37:40] Messiah, and as a root out of a dry
[37:41] ground. He hath no form, nor comeliness.
[37:45] And when we shall see him, there is no
[37:48] beauty that we should desire him.
[37:49] There's no appearance. There's no
[37:50] spectacle. The thing that is seen is not
[37:52] like thumbs up.
[37:57] There's no immediate heart. Love that.
[38:02] Retweet
[38:03] &gt;&gt; when you see it. It's It's mute. Not
[38:07] interested in this post. Block.
[38:12] Leave on red.
[38:14] There's no beauty that we should desire
[38:16] him. He is despised and rejected of men.
[38:18] A man of sorrows acquainted with grief.
[38:20] Now, now I'm seeing a different picture
[38:21] of this ruler of Israel.
[38:24] I I I'm seeing now even in his
[38:26] beginnings wrapped in swaddling clothes
[38:28] lying in a manger. Well, you would you
[38:30] would maybe you would see a babe wrapped
[38:31] in swaddling clothes. So, it speaks TO
[38:34] JUST THIS COMMONALITY of him if it was
[38:37] in fact these uh rags that were used uh
[38:40] in the care of animals AND THAT WOULD
[38:42] DEBASE him even the more so. BUT THE
[38:44] FACT THAT HE'S BORN WITHOUT A HOME,
[38:46] WITHOUT A WITHOUT A PLACE OF CARE, LYING
[38:48] IN a manger, maybe laying in a trough or
[38:51] something, a crib used for animals,
[38:55] perhaps a place for hay. Here he is
[38:58] being described, despised, and rejected
[38:59] a man of sorrows, acquainted grief, and
[39:01] we hid, as it were, our faces from him.
[39:04] You notice now how it says, "Seek my
[39:06] face."
[39:08] And then the the reality is people don't
[39:11] want to see it. They actually hide their
[39:13] face from it.
[39:16] This is this is where you begin to think
[39:17] of being blocked, right? And you can't
[39:20] see what someone posts.
[39:23] This is what we do. We want to block it.
[39:25] We we we don't want to see it. We don't
[39:27] want to know.
[39:30] I want to I I I removed myself from the
[39:32] Christ group chat.
[39:35] This is not something I want to see. We
[39:37] hide our faces, as it were, from him. He
[39:38] was despised and we esteemed him not.
[39:43] The prophecy foretold that Christ would
[39:45] be rejected.
[39:47] Rejected as not having any attraction,
[39:51] not something you would want to gaze
[39:53] upon. But it's actually, and I think
[39:55] we've all had that a feeling before
[39:58] where you see something and you turn
[39:59] away. I can't remember it, trypophobia
[40:02] or something like that. I've tried to
[40:04] trigger it before with some of my
[40:05] slides. It's where you see all those
[40:07] little dots and everything. Anybody have
[40:09] that? Anybody? I know. Yeah, I can see
[40:12] somebody can relate to. I know my
[40:13] family's got it. And I never I had never
[40:17] felt it before, knew what it was. But
[40:18] one time I bought uh my wife some
[40:20] flowers and uh and presented them to her
[40:23] and all of a SUDDEN SHE WAS LIKE
[40:26] AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?" SHE
[40:27] WAS THE BACK OF THAT LEAF. It creeped me
[40:29] out. And when I looked at it, it creeped
[40:31] me out. Me I just was overwhelmed with
[40:33] this overwhelming fear like it's aliens,
[40:36] right? And it just looks so weird. You
[40:38] didn't expect it to see it on the back
[40:39] of a leaf. AND YOU'RE LIKE, I CAN'T look
[40:42] at it. And so we kind of have this trope
[40:44] in our house where we'll grab we'll grab
[40:46] something, say, "Elizabeth, Elizabeth,
[40:48] mom, mom, mom, look at this. Look at
[40:49] this." And she go,
[40:53] and that's what IT IS IN CHRIST. THERE'S
[40:54] SOMETHING REPULSIVE ABOUT HIM. We turn
[40:57] away.
[41:01] So it's not
[41:03] maybe maybe there's a lot there's a lot
[41:05] in the way that he's wrapped.
[41:07] Maybe there's ways that he presents
[41:08] himself. Maybe there's things that are
[41:10] seen where we might not want to look
[41:12] into it because we're afraid of what
[41:13] we'll see.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; So, you're going to have to overcome
[41:15] that and say, "I'm going to risk it all
[41:19] and I'm going to look at it. I'm going
[41:21] to look into Christ.
[41:24] I I I've heard the controversy. I heard
[41:26] the rumors. I've heard the what may be
[41:27] truths, may be lies. I've heard all the
[41:29] ways that it's tried to be made
[41:31] controversial and repulsive and ugly.
[41:33] But I'm going to risk it. I'm going to
[41:34] look at it because I want to see it for
[41:36] myself."
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Someone may say, "Don't look at it. It's
[41:38] ugly.
[41:40] Or are we talking about Christ?
[41:43] Are we talking about the Bible? We
[41:45] talking about truth? Maybe it's worth
[41:46] looking into yourself.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16 15 to17.
[41:55] Jesus has said, "Who who do men say that
[41:57] I am?" Well, some say you're this, some
[41:58] say you're that, and have all these
[42:00] different idea ideas. And Jesus says,
[42:01] "Well, who do you say that I am?" And
[42:03] it's Simon Peter that answers in verse
[42:05] 16, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[42:08] living God." This is what Peter had
[42:10] seen.
[42:12] This is what Peter is experiencing. This
[42:14] is what he believes. He's following. And
[42:17] it's important to note that Peter is not
[42:18] just basing this on physical observation
[42:24] through his through his own metric. Thou
[42:27] art the Christ, the son of the living
[42:28] God. He's not just repeating maybe what
[42:30] he heard the demons say when they were
[42:31] cast out of his mom. He's not just
[42:32] repeating what Jesus said, but he says,
[42:34] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[42:36] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[42:38] unto thee. You have not simply gained
[42:40] this understanding through sight alone,
[42:42] but it has been made available to your
[42:44] understanding, your consciousness by the
[42:46] father which is in heaven."
[42:49] &gt;&gt; He had been revealed by the father. It
[42:52] was not the natural eye that saw the
[42:54] attraction, but it was the heart that
[42:55] was responding to the witness of the
[42:57] father.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; God revealed it to his heart. The Lord
[43:00] when you said Lord seek my Lord said
[43:02] seek MY FACE MY HEART said your face
[43:05] will I seek when Peter said thou art the
[43:08] Christ THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD IT'S
[43:09] NOT BECAUSE HIS EYES said it or his mind
[43:12] said it BECAUSE HIS HEART RESPONDED TO
[43:15] THE WITNESS OF THE FATHER
[43:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SHEPHERD SAID THIS IS TO TO YOU
[43:20] who's been born THIS DAY THE MESSIAH
[43:21] LYING IN A MANGER IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE
[43:23] THE ANGEL HAD SAID IT BUT THE EYES COULD
[43:26] RESPOND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE EYES SAW IT
[43:28] BUT THE HEART COULD RESPOND RESPOND TO
[43:30] WHAT THE ANGELS had said and they could
[43:31] see the perfect picture.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:34] &gt;&gt; I've been wrestling this out. Just not
[43:36] sure
[43:38] how to completely unpack this, but I'll
[43:41] just make reference in Galatians. Paul
[43:43] makes a statement. I don't have it today
[43:45] and I kind of pushed it off till maybe
[43:47] Sunday where it pleased God to reveal
[43:50] Christ in me. He says so was in the
[43:53] revelation is in you first.
[43:56] So there's got to be something in you
[44:00] in order to see and express or
[44:04] appreciate. If I can say this, you can't
[44:05] appreciate beauty unless there's some
[44:07] sort of internal sense of beauty.
[44:11] Some people are possessed with and and
[44:13] the word possessed may be can used any
[44:15] way you want. Possessed with the unique
[44:17] ability to see tones and hues in paint
[44:20] colors that the average person cannot
[44:22] see. Like that's a beautiful cream. Not
[44:25] too green. Oh, okay. This is another
[44:27] This is a beautiful cream. Not too
[44:28] yellow. You're like, "What? Okay. All
[44:30] right. This is a perfect cream. It's
[44:32] called perfect cream. No green, no
[44:34] yellow." Yeah, but there's a little bit
[44:35] of blue. Okay. All right. And but they
[44:38] because it's there
[44:40] &gt;&gt; and they have some sort of internal
[44:42] ability.
[44:43] For all the the colorblind brothers out
[44:45] there, you you say, "Hey, all I see is
[44:48] brown and green in the inverse."
[44:51] But there's a way that there's these
[44:53] things are because it's in you.
[44:57] It's in you then you can see it.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; How is it we know what kindness is?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Because we have some internal sense of
[45:04] what kindness is.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; And so this internal revelation that
[45:11] Peter had unveiled his eyes to see the
[45:13] beauty in the reality of Jesus the
[45:16] present reality of Jesus Christ.
[45:19] So here something internal is opened up
[45:23] for him to see what everyone else sees
[45:25] but he sees it differently.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; So well who do men say that I am? Some
[45:30] saw all these other things, a false
[45:32] prophet, be elabub, ELIJAH. BUT SOMEHOW
[45:36] PETER'S able to look at the same
[45:37] picture, SAY, "THOU ART THE CHRIST, the
[45:38] son of the living God." And Jesus
[45:40] saying, "You didn't figure that out on
[45:42] your own, but there was some greater
[45:44] depth given to you because something
[45:47] unlocks in your heart and now you can
[45:49] see what other people can't see."
[45:52] &gt;&gt; John 14 6 to9. I think we've read some
[45:54] of these here recently.
[45:57] I I think I'm losing track of time here.
[45:59] And um
[46:03] I don't know if I'm going to have time
[46:04] to finish this. So let's uh John chapter
[46:07] 14 6-9 Jesus saith unto him, I am the
[46:10] way, the truth, and the life. No man
[46:11] cometh unto the father but by me.
[46:14] If you had known me, you should have
[46:16] known my father.
[46:18] So now Christ is unveiling something.
[46:20] He's here. Christ is standing there and
[46:23] you say he is the way, the truth, the
[46:25] life. So say when you see him, do you
[46:27] know the way? Do you know the truth? Do
[46:29] you know the life? You've seen it.
[46:33] Visually, you've heard it audibly, but
[46:37] have you been able to actually see it?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Just because something has been visually
[46:42] appreciated, have you been able to
[46:44] internalize it and truly appreciate what
[46:46] it is?
[46:49] So often we could use this. How many
[46:51] times you said, "Did you uh that did you
[46:53] repeat what I said or did you see that?"
[46:55] And you say, "Yeah, I saw it." And it's
[46:56] like, "You saw that?" And that's all
[46:58] that you don't have any particular
[47:00] response to that. "Yeah, I saw it. What
[47:02] was it? What was this? It was that and
[47:03] the other." It's like, and that's normal
[47:05] to you. Like that picture was normal.
[47:07] Like, yeah. It's like, look at it again.
[47:09] Like, I'm looking at it say, "Do you see
[47:11] this?" And you see that? You're like,
[47:12] "Oh, okay. Everything changes now."
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Like, "Oh, this is not what I thought it
[47:19] was."
[47:21] He said, 'If you'd known me, you'd know
[47:22] my father, and from henceforth you know
[47:24] him and have seen him. You see, this is
[47:26] what he's saying. Here I am. You've seen
[47:28] him, but do you know him? He says, 'But
[47:31] you have known him and seen him because
[47:33] I've revealed him. SO PHILIP SAYS, LORD,
[47:36] SHOW US THE FATHER AND it sufficeth us.
[47:39] He's getting it, but he's not getting it
[47:41] because then Jesus says, "Have I been so
[47:42] long time with you, and yet hast thou
[47:44] not known me, Philillip? He hath he that
[47:48] hath seen me hath seen the father? And
[47:50] how sayest thou then show us the father?
[47:53] If you've seen me, you've seen the
[47:55] father.
[47:57] Again, think of this capacity to see and
[48:00] to know. Be still and know. And not just
[48:02] merely the the effects of the visual
[48:05] acuity, but there's actually more that
[48:07] takes place where it's now consciousness
[48:10] begins to absorb it and take it in
[48:13] that I'm not just uh seeing something.
[48:17] I'm not just looking at it. I've looked
[48:19] at it. It's been looked at.
[48:23] But now I'm seeing it.
[48:27] Looking at Christ,
[48:29] you can do with the natural eye. And I
[48:32] say this to us as believers now today
[48:34] that if there's a present reality of
[48:36] Christ, we can look at it with the
[48:37] natural eye.
[48:39] We can see with the natural eye, but
[48:41] then the heart is still bound.
[48:45] The heart is still wrapped. The
[48:46] consciousness, the understanding is
[48:48] still held back. Who do men say that I
[48:50] am? They were saying what they saw with
[48:51] the natural eye and their interpretation
[48:55] what the what the way they interpret it
[48:57] was filtered.
[48:59] So their hearts were wrapped. Jesus
[49:01] continues in verse 15, "If you love me,
[49:03] keep my commandments and I will pray to
[49:05] the father and he shall give you another
[49:06] comforter that he may abide with you
[49:08] forever. Even the spirit of truth whom
[49:11] the world cannot receive because it
[49:12] seeth him not neither knoweth him." But
[49:16] ye know him, for he dwelleth with you,
[49:18] and shall be in you. Now notice this.
[49:21] The world doesn't see him, but you will
[49:22] see him. This isn't looking at him. This
[49:24] is seeing him. I know I'm just using
[49:26] maybe semantics, but to make the point
[49:28] that some can look at something and not
[49:30] see it. What are you looking at? I'm
[49:33] looking at Perfectly Cream by Benjamin
[49:35] Moore. And what and okay, I see that.
[49:38] What do you see? Perfectly cream. But
[49:40] somebody else is saying you've looked at
[49:42] it, but someone else is looking at and
[49:43] they look at it in the light and they
[49:44] say, "I'm seeing perfectly cream with
[49:46] some hints of green.
[49:49] There's more there's more light. There's
[49:52] more thought given to it. There's
[49:53] comparison. There's contrast.
[49:57] But you shall see him for he dwelleth
[49:59] with you and shall be in you." Now
[50:00] there's the key. I will not leave you
[50:02] comfortless. I will come to you yet a
[50:03] little while and the world seeth me no
[50:05] more, but ye shall see me.
[50:08] The world may look upon him, but they
[50:10] won't see him.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; There there's are manifestations of his
[50:15] presence. There's truth being fulfilled.
[50:17] The world will look on it, but it will
[50:19] not see him. But you shall see him.
[50:21] Because I live, ye shall live also. And
[50:22] at that day you shall know that I am in
[50:23] my father, and ye in me, and I in you.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; There's that centering principle. He
[50:27] that hath my commandments, and keepeth
[50:28] him, he it is that loveth me, and he
[50:30] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[50:32] father, and I will love him, and will
[50:34] manifest myself to him. The
[50:36] manifestation is the scene. We can look
[50:39] on him, but when you see him, he's
[50:41] manifested himself to you. Judas saith
[50:44] unto him, "Not a scary Lord, how is it
[50:45] that thou will manifest thyself unto us
[50:47] and not unto the world?" He's asking the
[50:49] real questions. How is it that you're
[50:51] going to be seen of us and the world
[50:53] can't see you?
[50:55] What What kind of glasses are you giving
[50:57] us? What kind of filter are you giving
[50:59] us to where now we could somehow see you
[51:02] infrared and we could see you when
[51:03] nobody else can see you?
[51:08] It's a good question, isn't it?
[51:10] &gt;&gt; How is it you're going to make yourself
[51:11] known, but you're going to do it in a
[51:12] way where nobody else can see you, but
[51:14] we can. Jesus said, "It's given unto you
[51:15] to know the mysteries of the kingdom."
[51:17] &gt;&gt; So, he knew there was going to be some
[51:19] dynamic in some way. If a man love me,
[51:21] he will keep my words, and my father
[51:22] will love him. And we will come unto him
[51:24] and make our abode with him. I in you,
[51:27] and you and me. He that loveth me not
[51:30] keepeth not my sayings. And the words
[51:32] which you hear is not mine, but the
[51:33] fathers which is which sent me. These
[51:35] things have I spoken unto you, being yet
[51:38] present with you. But the comforter,
[51:40] which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
[51:42] will send in my name, he shall teach you
[51:44] all things. It's the inside teacher, the
[51:47] inside revealer,
[51:49] &gt;&gt; and bring all things to remembrance
[51:51] whatsoever I've said unto you. So you
[51:54] have the word spoken, the word written,
[51:56] but now the internal witness of the Holy
[51:58] Ghost that can give you the correct
[52:00] interpretation.
[52:02] Because think of this, we when it comes
[52:04] to the picture of Christ, you are not
[52:06] the creator of it or the critic of it.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; But you will be an interpreter of it.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You will be one that gazes upon it and
[52:13] looks at it and processes what it means.
[52:15] What does it mean to you? What is it you
[52:17] see?
[52:18] And so you'll have an inside comforter.
[52:21] If beauty can be appreciated because
[52:22] there's some internal sense of beauty,
[52:25] then there's this internal
[52:28] unveiling of Christ that allows him in
[52:31] his present reality to be seen and he
[52:34] will teach you all things.
[52:37] This is what Jesus is saying in chapter
[52:39] 14. Notice what he says in chapter 5:es
[52:41] 37 to 40. And the father himself which
[52:44] hath sent me hath borne witness of me.
[52:46] Ye have neither heard his voice at any
[52:48] time nor seen his shape. Once again, the
[52:51] Lord says, "Seek my face." And David
[52:52] said, "My heart said unto me, your face
[52:54] will I seek." And that's my desires. I
[52:56] want to behold your beauty. I want to
[52:57] see your glory. I want to look into your
[52:58] face. But then he told Moses, "You can't
[52:59] look into it and live." And now he's
[53:02] saying, "You've never heard his voice at
[53:04] any time, nor seen his shape." But he
[53:06] said, "When you've seen me, you've seen
[53:07] his the father.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; When you've heard me speak, you've heard
[53:11] his voice. And you have not his word
[53:12] abiding in you. for whom he hath sent
[53:15] him you believe not. You realize if I
[53:18] could put it this way those are two
[53:20] different groups of people.
[53:22] Those that are looking right at him and
[53:23] he says you haven't even seen him.
[53:26] Those hearing him says you hadn't even
[53:27] heard him. But then others when he says
[53:30] you both have seen him and know him.
[53:34] So then and he says you don't have the
[53:35] word abiding in you. And and I want you
[53:38] even think in terms of election. If
[53:40] you're ordained to truth, you can't
[53:42] outrun it.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; God God ain't gonna pick you to lose
[53:47] you.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; If you're ordained to truth, you're
[53:50] going to have to come to it. Now, you
[53:51] can choose a really hard route
[53:54] &gt;&gt; if you want, but God's not going to give
[53:56] up on you. He's not going to stop.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; He's going to chase you down. He might
[54:00] let you go a route that's really, really
[54:02] hard, but he's looking at you and he's
[54:03] watching. He goes, "That's a that's a
[54:05] tough detour, but I'll use that. Oh,
[54:08] that's gonna that's going to be some
[54:09] hurting, but I'll use that and he'll get
[54:12] you eventually.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So, he says, "Search the scriptures,
[54:19] for in them you think you have eternal
[54:21] life,
[54:22] &gt;&gt; and they are they which testify of me."
[54:27] &gt;&gt; That's the they them I believe in.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures, for in them you
[54:31] think you have eternal life, and they
[54:32] are they which testify of me.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; That's the original pure they them.
[54:38] them they
[54:40] and you will not come to me that you
[54:41] might have life.
[54:43] So where did he want them to look? Where
[54:46] were they going to look? He told them to
[54:48] search the scriptures.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful to us because we don't
[54:53] have the privilege of Jesus of Nazareth
[54:55] sitting in their midst today.
[54:58] We do not have the benefit of the
[55:00] physical Messiah appearing amongst us
[55:02] and and now at least being challenged in
[55:04] a in a much more tangible sense to look
[55:07] at someone performing miracles and
[55:08] multiplying bread and multiplying fish
[55:10] and raising the dead and walking on
[55:12] water. And in our minds, we're thinking,
[55:14] "Oh, well, I I'm challenged with all
[55:16] these things and all these sensory
[55:17] inputs and I and I'm seeing all these
[55:19] things and I've got to interpret it."
[55:21] But really, we can look into the word
[55:23] and Jesus Christ is revealed
[55:26] through the portrait that's painted in
[55:28] the Bible.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So he tells us we can search the
[55:31] scriptures. In Luke 4 16 to 21, it says,
[55:34] "He came to Nazareth where he had been
[55:36] brought up. And as his custom was, he
[55:38] went into the synag synagogue on the
[55:39] Sabbath day and stood up for to read.
[55:41] And there was delivered unto him the
[55:43] book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he
[55:45] had opened the book, HE FOUND THE PLACE
[55:47] WHERE IT WAS WRITTEN. IF I COULD SAY
[55:48] THIS, HE FOUND THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS
[55:50] WRITTEN OF HIM.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; The book is delivered to him. It's
[55:54] wrapped. IT'S ROLLED UP.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE SCROLL SEALED UP. ROLLED UP.
[55:58] WRAPPED UP. AND WHAT DOES HE DO? HE
[56:00] OPENS THE BOOK.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; AND HE FINDS IN THE book where it's
[56:04] written of him. AND HE SEES HIMSELF IN
[56:06] THE SCRIPTURE. HE SAYS, "THE spirit of
[56:07] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[56:09] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[56:10] poor. Heath sent me to heal the
[56:12] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[56:13] the captives and the recovering of the
[56:14] sight to the blind, to sit at liberty
[56:15] them that are bruised, to preach the
[56:17] acceptable year of the Lord. And he
[56:18] wraps it back up. WHY? BECAUSE THAT part
[56:21] had just is being unwrapped before them.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; He closes it up because the next parts
[56:27] pertains to another coming. And he gave
[56:28] it again to the minister and sat down.
[56:30] And all the eyes of them that in
[56:31] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[56:33] began to say unto them, "This day is
[56:35] this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
[56:38] unto you this day is born in the CITY OF
[56:41] DAVID A SAVIOR CHRIST THE LORD AND YOU
[56:43] WILL FIND HIM. This will be a sign to
[56:44] you. There he will be lying in a manger
[56:47] wrapped in swaddling clothes.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; But now we see this Messiah sitting and
[56:52] standing in the synagogue
[56:54] opening a book where it was written of
[56:56] him. Search the scriptures for they
[56:58] testify. They paint the picture. They
[56:59] give you the prophecy. Says this day
[57:01] this scripture is manifested before your
[57:04] eyes.
[57:08] This was their opportunity now to look
[57:10] at the picture. They're not the creators
[57:13] of the portrait, nor are they the
[57:15] critics of it. They must look at it and
[57:19] see if they can what do they see?
[57:22] What's revealed unto them?
[57:26] The sermon pride, brother Brandham said,
[57:28] the scriptures all tied together. I I
[57:30] want to read this because I think this
[57:31] is important for us to recognize this
[57:33] mechanism of what's in our heart. this
[57:36] spiritual eyesight, importance of the
[57:38] new birth, the Holy Spirit quickening
[57:41] this teacher on the inside. He says
[57:42] scripture is all tied together. How the
[57:45] Bible means so much more than it speaks
[57:47] if we can only have the Holy Spirit to
[57:49] interpret it for us. We only read it as
[57:52] we look down upon it. This is such
[57:55] beautiful poetry. We only read it as we
[57:57] look down upon it. You can look at the
[57:58] word. But he says, "But oh how the Holy
[58:00] Spirit says,"Child of mine, you are
[58:02] looking into my face." Now, when you
[58:04] look into this Bible, this is what I
[58:06] want you to know.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; We can read it, but have you read it?
[58:12] Oops. Don't go there. Reddit can be a
[58:16] very dangerous place, but you've you've
[58:18] you've you've looked at it, but do you
[58:20] see it?
[58:22] And may the Holy Spirit take the word of
[58:24] God today and deliver it to every heart
[58:26] just as we have need. and may we
[58:27] fellowship around the word. Now, he
[58:29] says, "Inspire us."
[58:32] This Bible has been wrapped with so many
[58:36] different denominational wraps,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; right? It's been interpreted and
[58:42] commented on and distorted and twisted.
[58:45] It's being more and more turned into
[58:47] even by
[58:49] devout believers in the scripture, it's
[58:51] being turned into an analogy of how to
[58:53] live.
[58:55] We don't have to take it as being
[58:57] actually happening. The the walls of
[58:59] Jericho didn't actually fall down. It's
[59:02] analogous of the difficulties that we
[59:03] face whenever we enter into the place
[59:05] that we're called to be by whatever
[59:07] divine power is leading you. We all have
[59:10] Jerichos, right? There's no literal
[59:13] walls. The the walking around just
[59:15] speaks of perseverance and endurance and
[59:17] and it's done to kind of just GIVE THIS
[59:19] IMAGE. CHRIST IS JUST AN ANALOGY. It's
[59:22] the hero arc THAT YOU FIND IN ALL other
[59:25] religions of sincere people
[59:28] and it's being watered down.
[59:31] But this Bible is Jesus Christ.
[59:36] It contains and it holds if I just look
[59:38] at it. If I just look at it, I'm not
[59:39] going to see it. But the Holy Spirit can
[59:42] reveal to me Jesus Christ in this book.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; But it's been so bound what it needed to
[59:47] become as a new book.
[59:51] In 2 Corinthians chapter 3 15-16,
[59:55] but even unto this day when Moses is
[59:57] read, the veil is upon their heart.
[1:00:02] When Moses is read, in other words, when
[1:00:03] the Bible is read, there's a veil on
[1:00:04] their heart. They're reading. It doesn't
[1:00:05] mean they don't know how to read.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean they don't look. Didn't
[1:00:08] mean they didn't see Christ, but there
[1:00:10] was a veil on their heart so they
[1:00:12] couldn't see. Nevertheless, when it
[1:00:14] shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall
[1:00:15] be taken away. When you see him as he
[1:00:17] is, that means something's been removed.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Something's been unveiled.
[1:00:25] When our hearts are wrapped, when our
[1:00:27] hearts are veiled, it keeps us from
[1:00:29] seeing what we're looking on.
[1:00:32] Jesus was wrapped in swaddling clothes
[1:00:35] lying in the manger. And the very things
[1:00:38] that wrapped it, the angel said, "It's a
[1:00:40] sign."
[1:00:42] That the sign, the wrapping itself was
[1:00:44] symbolic. The wrapping itself was to
[1:00:46] mean something to them. It was to
[1:00:48] signify something.
[1:00:53] Did anybody know what time I started?
[1:00:55] Anybody brave enough to tell me?
[1:00:58] Was it 10:30? I don't know. I I I mean,
[1:01:02] you're not playing that game. I mean,
[1:01:05] you could say, "Well, brother Aaron,
[1:01:06] you've been preaching for an hour and a
[1:01:07] half." And and we just stop right there.
[1:01:13] But in the sermon, we have seen his star
[1:01:14] and have come to worship him. And
[1:01:17] brother Bram's preaching this on
[1:01:18] December 16th in 1963. He says, "Today
[1:01:20] we have a great big present. When we
[1:01:22] have a great big present, we wrap it
[1:01:25] up." And he says, "Take $3 to wrap it
[1:01:27] up." Well, don't we adjust that for
[1:01:28] Biden's inflation.
[1:01:30] He says, "But then we put all kinds of
[1:01:32] tinsel on it."
[1:01:35] And many times you think it's a great
[1:01:36] present.
[1:01:38] So you you you buy something and now
[1:01:40] what you've bought. Now, I think this
[1:01:42] speaks to um the the the childlike
[1:01:45] expectations that we have, right? If you
[1:01:47] give your kids one gift, you can open
[1:01:49] one gift. One gift on Christmas Eve. And
[1:01:52] what do they want to open up? The
[1:01:53] biggest one, right? And it's a, you
[1:01:56] know, a Dallas Cowboys trash can or
[1:01:57] something like that. Like,
[1:02:00] can I open another one? But this is a
[1:02:03] 32gallon trash can. I know it's the
[1:02:06] biggest one, but I don't want this.
[1:02:09] There's something about the wrapping the
[1:02:10] paper big and we're going to put all
[1:02:11] kinds of tinsel. We're going to jazz it
[1:02:13] up. He says, "You think it's a great
[1:02:15] present." And he tells a story how he
[1:02:16] saw these two sisters standing in a
[1:02:18] store. They were related to one another
[1:02:20] and the store talking to each other and
[1:02:21] he said, "What are you going to get
[1:02:22] daddy?" The one sister said, "I'm going
[1:02:24] to get him a deck of cards and a carton
[1:02:26] of cigarettes."
[1:02:28] And the other one said, "I got him a
[1:02:30] fifth of whiskey." which I have read
[1:02:33] that a fifth of whiskey can
[1:02:35] significantly decreases the awareness of
[1:02:37] a heart attack.
[1:02:44] It's true. Don't you think? Wouldn't it?
[1:02:46] Yeah. I got him a fifth of whiskey and
[1:02:49] I'm going to wrap it up. And brothers,
[1:02:52] listen to say, "Well, what kind of gifts
[1:02:53] are these? WHAT DOES THIS REFLECT ABOUT
[1:02:55] DAD?" That guy was a character.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Cigarettes, a deck OF CARDS, AND A FIFTH
[1:03:00] OF WHISKEY. THAT'S THE UNCLE you want to
[1:03:02] come over for Thanksgiving.
[1:03:05] This it it spoke something about the one
[1:03:07] who's RECEIVING THE GIFTS AND WHAT HIS
[1:03:09] DAUGHTERS THOUGHT ABOUT HIM.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; It'd be like a
[1:03:14] you know, your kids's buying you a
[1:03:16] coffee maker and you're Mormon.
[1:03:23] But he says the TINSEL ON THE OUTSIDE
[1:03:24] DOESN'T DECLARE WHAT'S on the inside.
[1:03:27] Dress it up all pretty. Isn't this
[1:03:29] beautiful? Isn't this pretty? But
[1:03:30] inside's a fifth of whiskey. Death.
[1:03:34] But God has got a Christmas present for
[1:03:36] you.
[1:03:38] He wrapped it in a manger.
[1:03:41] The outside wasn't very much, but oh,
[1:03:44] the inside is eternal life.
[1:03:48] I kind of summarize this statement by
[1:03:50] saying the wrapping can be deceiving.
[1:03:53] Because the way the world wants to dress
[1:03:55] up its gift, we might humanly say, "I
[1:03:59] want it." Based upon the wrapping, when
[1:04:02] what you really want isn't wrapped in
[1:04:06] things that are instinctively we reach
[1:04:08] for
[1:04:10] the glitter, the glow, the the the
[1:04:11] glamour. And he makes this statement.
[1:04:15] Will you not let this phenomena of the
[1:04:18] Holy Spirit strike your life tonight and
[1:04:21] lead you to the eternal light?
[1:04:24] Wow.
[1:04:26] Will you not let this phenomena
[1:04:29] of the Holy Spirit?
[1:04:32] There is no such thing of us having some
[1:04:34] sort of group creed that we all can just
[1:04:36] recite and we're all in.
[1:04:40] individually. You must have the
[1:04:42] phenomena of the Holy Spirit strike your
[1:04:45] life
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; where you said unto me, seek your face
[1:04:49] and my heart said flesh and blood hath
[1:04:51] not revealed this unto you but my father
[1:04:52] which is in heaven and it gives you the
[1:04:55] inside teacher so that you yourself can
[1:04:57] look into the word and say Lord show me
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; who you are.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; We could be challenged to say well I
[1:05:06] wonder if this is true. So what we're
[1:05:07] going to do we're going to ask AI
[1:05:11] We're going to ask. We're going to
[1:05:12] search the forms. We're going to go.
[1:05:13] We're going to try to compile these
[1:05:15] things and tell me whether or not it's
[1:05:16] true. Do you believe there's a Holy
[1:05:18] Spirit?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Do you believe you have the Holy Spirit
[1:05:21] so you yourself can look into the word
[1:05:24] of God and say, "Lord, I want to see you
[1:05:26] as you are, and you can stand upon the
[1:05:28] Lord leading you to eternal light."
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; What I'm preaching is Christ unwrapped.
[1:05:36] He was wrapped and swallowed in clothes
[1:05:37] on the days of his birth. And if we were
[1:05:39] to find the Messiah today, we wouldn't
[1:05:42] find him in a manger.
[1:05:45] That day that we read about it in in
[1:05:47] Luke 4, he was in the synagogue opening
[1:05:50] the book.
[1:05:52] And so, symbolically, he's going to
[1:05:55] present himself to you as a babe wrapped
[1:05:58] in a manger.
[1:06:00] And that he he must be unwrapped before
[1:06:02] you to see that in there behind this
[1:06:04] humble wrapping is Christ eternal life.
[1:06:08] that he is in his word and you search
[1:06:10] the scriptures but it has to be
[1:06:11] unbounded. It has to be unveiled. Has to
[1:06:13] be opened up to us.
[1:06:16] Christ when he was born of course he
[1:06:18] came forth naked but he was immediately
[1:06:20] washed maybe even salted wrapped in
[1:06:23] swaddling clothes and nurtured. He was
[1:06:25] cared for.
[1:06:28] But one day that Messiah was hanging on
[1:06:30] a cross.
[1:06:32] Musicians, if you'd come in John chapter
[1:06:34] 19, it says that they took his garments.
[1:06:38] I know the depictions often show him
[1:06:41] with the loin cloth so that he's not
[1:06:43] entirely naked. And though the debate on
[1:06:45] this is quite rich
[1:06:47] where some say, well, to the Jews, uh,
[1:06:50] it would be shameful to be naked and so
[1:06:52] Christ would have never been stripped
[1:06:54] naked. But then you find in the Bible
[1:06:55] that in the most extreme punishments of
[1:06:57] the man, he was to be stripped naked
[1:06:59] when he was stoned.
[1:07:01] And so then you find in other places
[1:07:03] where they say, "Well, the the the Jews
[1:07:05] were the ones that were calling for
[1:07:06] this, not the Romans. The Romans
[1:07:07] stripped him naked, but the Jews were
[1:07:08] wanting to do this." And listen, he was
[1:07:10] stripped naked.
[1:07:14] What was taking place there in John
[1:07:16] [music] 19? It says, "They took his
[1:07:17] garments and parted them."
[1:07:19] Let us rend it that the scripture might
[1:07:23] be fulfilled. and they parted my
[1:07:24] raignment among them
[1:07:26] and for my vesture did they cast lots.
[1:07:27] [music] is quoting Psalm 22. He says, "I
[1:07:30] they tell all my bones. They stare upon
[1:07:31] me with all my bones. I'm naked. I'm
[1:07:33] laid bare." What was happening? The
[1:07:36] Messiah that was wrapped was now being
[1:07:40] stripped,
[1:07:42] laid bare.
[1:07:45] And it's even at that moment, the veil
[1:07:47] to the temple is being torn. All
[1:07:49] symbolizing this unveiling he's lifted
[1:07:51] up before them. There he hangs between
[1:07:54] two malifactors.
[1:07:56] They part my garments among them. They
[1:07:57] stripped me, laid me bare and naked. And
[1:08:00] what was he? He was a sign.
[1:08:02] Just as he was a sign, laid in a manger,
[1:08:05] wrapped in swaddling clothes, now
[1:08:06] unwrapped, hanging on the cross.
[1:08:09] And I believe that we have to see Christ
[1:08:12] in his word. Look at the picture that's
[1:08:14] painted of a savior born on Christmas
[1:08:16] day. Look at the picture of the savior
[1:08:18] standing in the synagogue opening up the
[1:08:20] scroll. Look at the picture of him
[1:08:22] hanging upon the cross.
[1:08:24] Can you see Christ revealed in his word?
[1:08:28] When brother Brandham wrote the church
[1:08:29] age book, he says, "I'll give you a
[1:08:30] sign." God said, "Not the sign of a
[1:08:33] white collared priesthood. Not the sign
[1:08:34] of wealth AND POWER. THERE'S NOTHING IN
[1:08:37] THIS SIGN THAT YOU'LL want or think
[1:08:38] suitable, but it is an everlasting sign.
[1:08:43] It is the greatest sign of all.
[1:08:47] Let me hear about this ruler. Let me
[1:08:48] hear about this wonderful counselor. Let
[1:08:49] me think hear about this mighty God.
[1:08:51] Paint the picture for me, [music]
[1:08:52] prophet.
[1:08:54] Paint the picture for me. Micah, Isaiah,
[1:08:56] paint, paint the picture for me. Let me
[1:08:58] see him as he is. Jehovah standing in
[1:09:03] the courtyard, bruised and bleeding with
[1:09:04] thorns on his brow and [music] spit on
[1:09:06] his face, mocked and said it not.
[1:09:09] Jehovah despised and rejected, hanging
[1:09:12] naked upon the cross, while the
[1:09:14] hypocrites jered and dared him to come
[1:09:15] down off the cross. Jehovah dying,
[1:09:18] Jehovah praying and nothing happening.
[1:09:20] Then Jehovah died.
[1:09:23] That is the sign for all [music] men
[1:09:24] now. There isn't another like it. It is
[1:09:28] the great one.
[1:09:30] What was he unwrapped,
[1:09:33] unveiled before [music] our eyes to see
[1:09:35] him? Here he is. Will you receive him? I
[1:09:40] don't know if I want a Messiah THAT'S
[1:09:41] DYING ON A CROSS. I don't know if I want
[1:09:44] HIM WITH ALL HIS CONTROVERSIES and all
[1:09:45] his all this ugliness. Well, what are
[1:09:47] you looking with?
[1:09:50] Should we not as Christians, should we
[1:09:53] not as believers, should we not as
[1:09:54] people who claim to have Christ on his
[1:09:56] eyes, should we not look at him and
[1:09:59] desire to see what he is
[1:10:03] and say, "Lord, open up my eyes. Lord, I
[1:10:07] want to see.
[1:10:09] I want to see for what you are.
[1:10:13] What is the picture of Christ? How can
[1:10:15] he become beautiful to us?"
[1:10:17] And I think what he needs is just as he
[1:10:19] hung on that cross that day and was
[1:10:20] unwrapped, our hearts need to be
[1:10:22] unwrapped.
[1:10:24] Unwrapped to be raptured.
[1:10:27] Unveiled to see his face.
[1:10:31] Christ could be standing amongst us
[1:10:34] revealing himself, but as long as
[1:10:35] there's a veil on my heart, [music] I
[1:10:37] can look at him and never see him.
[1:10:42] I know we got a lot of ideas in our
[1:10:43] minds sometimes of what we think the way
[1:10:45] things are, but could you even risk it
[1:10:47] to say, "I'm if it's true, Lord, I'm
[1:10:49] willing. If this Bible's true, if if if
[1:10:52] you died, whatever the truth is, if
[1:10:54] you're willing to say, I want to look at
[1:10:55] it and I want to [music] risk it being
[1:10:57] true."
[1:10:59] We should do that. If we want to see
[1:11:02] Christ
[1:11:04] unwrapped,
[1:11:05] if you need something from the Lord
[1:11:07] today, I encourage you to look in his
[1:11:08] face because he [music] says, "Seek my
[1:11:11] face." Does your heart say, "Your face I
[1:11:13] will seek." Could we stand to pray?
[1:11:17] Let's do so together. your gracious
[1:11:18] heavenly father today Lord through the
[1:11:22] length of this sermon
[1:11:24] tried to present the thought that you've
[1:11:27] really impressed upon me [music] over
[1:11:28] the last couple months maybe even this
[1:11:30] whole year
[1:11:32] of how these portraits of Christ that
[1:11:36] the gospels paint
[1:11:40] and how they can be dissimilar
[1:11:44] how each one of us have different
[1:11:46] experiences [music] and different
[1:11:47] viewoints voids.
[1:11:50] But what do we see?
[1:11:53] David said he wanted to behold the
[1:11:55] beauty of the Lord. You said, you said,
[1:11:56] "Seek my face." But then you said that
[1:11:59] if I I could if I saw your face, I
[1:12:01] wouldn't live. You said it to Moses. So
[1:12:03] then what is it we look at?
[1:12:06] Truly, Lord, right now, if we knew that
[1:12:08] you spoke to us and said somewhere
[1:12:12] in the forest of Eastern [music] Europe,
[1:12:15] the Messiah is standing there,
[1:12:18] that you were there, and you said, "Go
[1:12:20] see us." That [music] if we knew that
[1:12:22] was you speaking to us, we'd go.
[1:12:26] But according to prophecy, according to
[1:12:28] scripture, Paul said that we would
[1:12:30] behold you. And it's [music] this
[1:12:32] unveiling, this revealing of Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ to us in us.
[1:12:39] That's the promise to a gentile,
[1:12:42] to the Jews. You would come,
[1:12:46] a messenger would be sent before your
[1:12:47] face.
[1:12:49] There'd be a physical Messiah. That's
[1:12:51] what you promised to the Jews. And yes,
[1:12:54] Lord, you've promised that you will meet
[1:12:56] us in the air, that we would return with
[1:12:58] [music] you. you would step foot on
[1:13:00] earth again in the millennium and we
[1:13:01] would rule and reign with you for a
[1:13:02] thousand years. Yes, [music] there is
[1:13:04] going to be a physical glory.
[1:13:08] But in the meantime, you promised to
[1:13:10] reveal yourself in [music] your word.
[1:13:13] I don't see you hanging on a cross with
[1:13:15] my physical eye, but [music] could you,
[1:13:17] Lord, today unveil my heart to see that
[1:13:18] the price was paid on Calvary
[1:13:21] for all my sins.
[1:13:24] Lord, may you open my eyes to see that
[1:13:27] you rose up on Easter [music] morning
[1:13:30] for my justification
[1:13:33] and you ascended into glory
[1:13:35] for my full redemption.
[1:13:38] Lord, I pray that we are our [music]
[1:13:40] eyes could see you as the narrative
[1:13:43] unfolds in our lives. We know that we
[1:13:45] have to meet you at these different
[1:13:46] junctures in these different places
[1:13:48] where you make yourself known. Not
[1:13:50] historically, but in the present [music]
[1:13:52] reality. We need to see you, Lord.
[1:13:55] Unveil our eyes to see you as you are.
[1:14:01] Lord, I find that when I'm at my worst,
[1:14:04] it's because I'm wrapped up in the wrong
[1:14:07] things.
[1:14:08] You've been hidden from me. I can't I I
[1:14:11] I I look, but I don't see. I hear, but
[1:14:13] I'm not really listen. I'm listening,
[1:14:16] but I'm not really hearing. Lord,
[1:14:19] can I [music] see what you see?
[1:14:22] Can I hear what you hear?
[1:14:25] Help us today, I pray as we commit all
[1:14:27] to you, our visitors, family here, each
[1:14:29] one,
[1:14:31] we want you to be unwrapped, unveiled
[1:14:33] before us. Rent the veil of the temple
[1:14:35] to expose how godless our traditions
[1:14:37] are. But may we see you in plain view,
[1:14:40] high and lifted up
[1:14:42] with that spiritual eye in our hearts.
[1:14:44] We love you. We commit ourselves to you
[1:14:47] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:50] Amen.
[1:14:51] Amen.
