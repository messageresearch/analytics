[0:00] what a beautiful
[0:01] scripture um this this scripture it's
[0:05] it's talking about fear which I think we
[0:08] can
[0:09] all understand in one aspect or another
[0:12] about fear um but it's talking about a
[0:16] specific fear this is not just talking
[0:18] about spiders or a general anxiety it's
[0:21] not talking about phobias you know you
[0:22] can have a fear of balloons people have
[0:25] fear of clowns and it's just irrational
[0:28] phobia sometimes it's not social fears
[0:31] you know coming up here and speaking you
[0:33] know people might be
[0:35] afraid um I know it's it's a
[0:38] nerve-wrecking
[0:39] thing um performance anxiety uh fear of
[0:44] the unknown acute and chronic fears
[0:46] development fears post-traumatic fears
[0:49] there's many fears that are in our lives
[0:52] and and um but this is a specific fear
[0:56] even though with all of those fears
[0:58] there's so many fears in our lives
[1:00] that can pop up whether it's it's like
[1:03] it says acute an acute fear or a chronic
[1:06] fear something that was uh you grew up
[1:09] having this kind of fear God deals with
[1:11] every
[1:12] fear God will go and you can go into the
[1:15] scripture and you'll see how he will
[1:18] deal with every single fear in our lives
[1:21] whether it's anxiety whether it's it's
[1:25] feeling like you're not worthy enough
[1:27] feeling certain fears God will deal with
[1:29] it right there's um I I heard somebody
[1:32] say that the most common phrase in the
[1:34] whole entire Bible is do not fear that
[1:38] you know what that helps me out a lot
[1:40] because it could be a common fear I mean
[1:43] a common phrase could be anything but
[1:45] for God to tell his people do not fear
[1:48] and it was for many aspects of people's
[1:51] lives whenever they saw Jesus on the
[1:53] water they
[1:54] feared when they saw uh the big storm
[1:58] happening and Jesus sleeping they feared
[2:00] for their lives so there was there was
[2:03] fear of uncertainty there was fear of
[2:05] death there was fear of turmoil there
[2:07] was fear of so many things and God
[2:10] coming through the Old Testament all the
[2:12] way to the new saying do not fear what
[2:16] an insurance for each and every one of
[2:18] us but um here it's talking about a
[2:22] specific
[2:23] fear and and brother brandham says that
[2:26] that there's two elements in in the
[2:28] world it's either faith fear that that
[2:31] these two elements will control Nations
[2:35] they control denominations they'll
[2:37] control people these two elements
[2:40] brother brandham called them elements
[2:41] the these are are real
[2:43] things that will come and they will take
[2:46] over our life whether it's fear or faith
[2:50] but here is it specifies a certain fear
[2:54] and this is the fear of
[2:57] judgment let's read um first John again
[3:00] it says here is our love made perfect
[3:04] that we have boldness in the day of
[3:08] judgment because as he is so are we in
[3:11] this world there is no fear in love but
[3:14] perfect love cast out fear because fear
[3:17] hath torment he that fearth is not made
[3:20] perfect in love we love him because he
[3:23] first loved us now first he's
[3:27] showing future tense that he he goes
[3:30] back and forth from from the future to
[3:32] the present to the past to the Future to
[3:34] the
[3:35] present and here he says our love has
[3:39] been made perfect when we have boldness
[3:43] in that day no not today in that day
[3:47] that our our love has been matured
[3:52] brother Aaron he's been talking about
[3:53] how perfect means a maturity or a
[3:56] completion so now he's talking about
[3:59] this certain love that we have towards
[4:01] God that our love has been made matured
[4:04] or complete whenever we go onto that day
[4:07] and we have boldness in that day and we
[4:11] can see him and there is no fear now
[4:14] this is this is an amazing Revelation
[4:16] that Paul or that uh John gives us the
[4:19] fact that that this day the day of
[4:22] judgment is the most terrifying
[4:25] day we can have fears for everything we
[4:28] can be have fear of death but the fear
[4:32] of judgment in Revelations 2011 it says
[4:36] I saw a white saw a great white throne
[4:39] and in and him that sat on it whose face
[4:43] the Earth and Heaven fled away and there
[4:46] was no place found for them so even at
[4:49] the face of this
[4:51] person whenever the Earth and and Heaven
[4:55] saw this man they fled
[4:57] away it it's a terrifying day because
[5:01] because just like I said there's people
[5:03] that have fear of Torment there's people
[5:05] that have gone through many things but
[5:07] Jesus says do not fear the ones that can
[5:09] can kill the body but that can destroy
[5:12] the soul and send it to
[5:14] hell and that word hell is I I think
[5:17] gaha or it's the Lake of
[5:21] Fire so that there's this fear of this
[5:25] person this ultimate person that can not
[5:27] only just take us to another dimension
[5:30] but it's going to completely annihilate
[5:33] us this is the most terrifying
[5:36] day yet John is saying that there is a
[5:39] Perfection of
[5:41] love that there there is an amount of
[5:44] love that God gives us because he first
[5:47] loved us that's why we can do
[5:49] this and there's there's an a confidence
[5:52] that we can have that we can stand in
[5:54] the day of
[5:56] judgment in the most terrifying day
[6:00] and and be bold in that
[6:02] day that's
[6:04] amazing that's amazing that he gave us
[6:08] that confidence now here in in in 1 John
[6:12] 4:18 he's dealing
[6:14] with this kind of fear now presently now
[6:18] see he said that we're going to have
[6:21] boldness in that
[6:22] day but now in 18 he's talking about
[6:26] this fear that there is no fear in love
[6:30] but fear cast out fear because fear hath
[6:33] torment he that fearth is not made
[6:35] perfect in
[6:37] love now he's talking about
[6:40] today that that this thing called Fear
[6:44] Can a Believer today even though
[6:47] the Judgment Day is in that day in the
[6:51] Lord's day one of these days we're going
[6:53] to stand there our love is going to be
[6:56] made perfect but today sometimes this
[6:59] crippling fear goes on a
[7:03] believer that hey I'm not good
[7:06] enough this this fear of
[7:10] condemnation this fear of I'm not
[7:14] saved and the way John writes it it it
[7:16] almost shows that that this is
[7:19] final that if you don't have love then
[7:22] you're you or if you have fear then you
[7:24] don't have
[7:26] love but he's showing that there there's
[7:28] a progression
[7:31] and maybe it causes people to interpret
[7:33] that if you have fear you don't have
[7:35] love maybe it means that you're not
[7:38] saved but I I encourage everybody to
[7:41] listen to a a beautiful message from a
[7:44] brother Aaron that is perfecting love
[7:46] and he explains
[7:48] this that he explains that this is not a
[7:51] final thing that you either have love or
[7:53] you don't but that there's a perfe
[7:56] perfecting in you see God's love it
[7:59] doesn't grow and grow and grow God's
[8:02] love is already perfect but what we're
[8:05] doing is we're perfecting ourselves why
[8:08] by how by the knowledge of God more you
[8:10] know him the more you love him and as
[8:14] you progress more into him the more
[8:16] confidence you have for him and that
[8:20] fear begins to diminish and diminish and
[8:22] diminish until it says until that day
[8:25] where your love is made perfect you'll
[8:28] have confidence in that day and this
[8:32] part of the scripture might seem like
[8:33] the most dividing part whether you have
[8:36] love or not but it says that he that
[8:39] fearth is not made perfect in
[8:42] love and actually for me that's where
[8:44] the hope lies amen because now we're
[8:48] understanding that every Sunday and
[8:50] every Wednesday that
[8:51] Perfection is a condition of
[8:55] maturity so Perfection is not a
[8:58] modification right Perfection is not
[9:01] something that is just you blink on or
[9:02] or you have it or you don't and then if
[9:04] you don't have it then there's you don't
[9:07] have love you don't have this no a
[9:10] perfecting love amen so it says that
[9:14] that if if he that fearth is not made
[9:18] perfect it means that we're
[9:20] perfecting it means that we're
[9:23] growing that if there is fear in you
[9:25] that means that we're not to that point
[9:28] where we can stand in the day of
[9:29] judgment and we can look at him face to
[9:32] face and not have any
[9:34] fear so that he that he fearth that
[9:37] means we just we have room to
[9:40] grow that that means we There's Hope
[9:43] still that means there's still potential
[9:47] you know I I love
[9:48] potential potential means there's still
[9:51] power in the
[9:52] engine there's still more in the chamber
[9:56] there's still more of God to give to me
[9:59] yeah
[9:59] I I love potential God is
[10:02] potential God is not a a finite thing
[10:05] where there's a period there even when
[10:08] God created all the heavens and the
[10:09] earth when God he said let there be this
[10:12] let there be that he didn't
[10:14] say okay I'm done no he had more to give
[10:19] and when he gives he still has more to
[10:21] give and when he gives it all he still
[10:24] has more to give why because he is
[10:27] potential amen that's why he's the I'm
[10:29] omnipotent one all
[10:33] powerful why he has all potential in him
[10:37] he has everything so whenever we say ah
[10:40] I'm not where I'm supposed to be that
[10:42] means there's more God to give that
[10:45] there is more love to give to us there's
[10:47] more love that can be perfected within
[10:50] me when I say oh I'm not who I used to
[10:54] be and I or or what's that saying is uh
[10:57] I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what
[10:59] I want to be but I'm sure glad I'm not
[11:02] who I used to be and and you know what
[11:05] for me the I'm not what I ought to be
[11:07] and I'm not what I'm supposed to be
[11:09] that's my
[11:10] hope that that I'm still going that
[11:14] there's still room to grow I don't ever
[11:16] want to get to a point where I say I'm
[11:18] finished I'm done I'm good cuz even
[11:22] Paul even Paul had this struggle in his
[11:26] flesh this he called it an indwelling
[11:28] sin with him that he had to fight every
[11:31] single day to the day he died so so this
[11:36] Perfection we're growing into it yeah
[11:40] the Perfection of
[11:42] love the getting to know who this person
[11:45] is named Jesus
[11:47] Christ
[11:49] now now where does this fear stem from
[11:53] this this odd fear because it plagues
[11:56] everybody but where the devil wants to
[11:59] hit it is the
[12:00] believer see a person can fear God and
[12:04] then they'll just get
[12:05] away you know the Bible says that that
[12:09] the word was the light Jesus was the
[12:11] light and it says men rather love
[12:13] Darkness than light why because their
[12:15] deeds are evil the light was the
[12:18] unveiling or the uncovering of your sin
[12:22] it's the word shedding light in our
[12:24] hearts showing oh man I'm not where I'm
[12:26] supposed to
[12:27] be and then so people rather love
[12:30] Darkness than the light because they
[12:32] don't want to know so what do they do
[12:35] they flee away from it but us we want to
[12:38] know Lord what can I do how can I get
[12:41] closer to you so he sheds light in our
[12:44] lives and if we're not careful the
[12:46] devil's right there ready to give us a
[12:49] condemning
[12:50] thought ready us ready to give us a
[12:54] fear that will a
[12:57] Believer where did come from if you'd
[13:00] like to turn with me to Genesis
[13:03] 3 uh: 6
[13:07] to1 I'll just read from 8 to
[13:11] 10 and this is this is where the sin
[13:16] happened this is where the woman she saw
[13:18] the
[13:19] fruit she ate it she gave it to her
[13:21] husband we know what the Act was and
[13:25] then their eyes were
[13:27] open their eyes eyes were open and and
[13:30] they tried to cover it up they tried to
[13:32] hide themselves they tried to make fig
[13:36] leaves and now now they have been
[13:39] impacted by a wrongdoing or a sin in
[13:42] their lives and in verse 8 it says and
[13:46] then they heard the voice of the Lord
[13:48] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[13:50] day now now remember this is the same
[13:54] God God never
[13:56] changes his love never changes
[13:59] his disposition for his children never
[14:03] changes but something changed here it
[14:06] says that uh that uh walking in the cool
[14:09] of the day Adam and his wife hid
[14:12] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[14:15] God amongst the Trees of the
[14:17] garden and the Lord God called unto Adam
[14:20] and said unto him where art thou and he
[14:23] said I heard thy
[14:26] voice and I was afraid
[14:29] because I was naked and I hid
[14:33] myself what
[14:35] happened Adam's
[14:37] sin he or Adam's
[14:40] response to God reveals the impact of
[14:43] sin in a person's
[14:46] life that fear
[14:48] came where does Fear stem from from from
[14:53] a sin in our lives right so when sin hit
[14:57] his life there was was a sense of
[15:00] inadequacy a sense of
[15:02] unworthiness a sense of of dread of
[15:06] judgment from God to where he feared
[15:09] fear came to his life and he like
[15:13] brother bam says human nature kicked in
[15:15] and he ran
[15:17] away and all of the earth that's what
[15:19] they do they run away from the presence
[15:21] of God why because there is a sense of
[15:24] fear that's why people try to disprove
[15:27] the Bible people try to uh
[15:29] hate the Bible so much why because when
[15:32] it's spoken out it starts uncovering
[15:34] their sin and they don't like
[15:36] it so they they have to find a way to
[15:39] disprove it they have to find a way to
[15:41] say no everything is all good and
[15:43] they'll find their own God and make him
[15:46] the way they want
[15:47] him why there there's a
[15:49] fear and and you know what this fear is
[15:53] Justified because um his sin just
[15:56] alienated him from God
[16:00] right and it transformed
[16:03] him when he hears the voice of God he
[16:05] expresses fear and desire to hide saying
[16:08] I was afraid cuz I was naked and I hid
[16:10] myself this re reaction ill illustrates
[16:14] a fundamental shift in his original
[16:17] state his original state of innocence
[16:20] and his communion with God now this is a
[16:23] contrast between Adam's initial State
[16:26] and his post-fall condition it scores
[16:29] the transformal effects of
[16:33] sin in our human nature what does it do
[16:36] it creates barriers in our
[16:39] lives when there there never was any it
[16:43] leads us to a state a deep stated desire
[16:46] to escape from the very Source of
[16:50] Life the thing is God never changed
[16:53] right the thing is God is not this scary
[16:57] being he is still Aba
[16:59] father he's still
[17:03] god brother brandham he says in in
[17:06] Jehovah Gyra he says the very nature of
[17:08] him in the Garden of Eden as soon as he
[17:10] sinned it should have been Adam well now
[17:14] now focus on it should have been Adam
[17:17] right running up and down through the
[17:19] garden crying father father Where Art
[17:23] Thou but it was God going through the
[17:25] garden crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[17:28] and was
[17:29] hiding and that is his nature today
[17:32] man's nature is not to come out and
[17:34] confess his sins it's to hide behind
[17:37] something and they're still doing
[17:40] it it should have been
[17:43] Adam when when we sin it should be us
[17:47] saying father
[17:49] father but because sin there's a fear
[17:54] that comes and because of fear there's a
[17:57] lack of confidence and what happens our
[17:59] love begins to
[18:02] degrade God's love is always perfect but
[18:05] but what happened in the Garden of Eden
[18:07] it was a transformative power to where
[18:10] his love his confidence his Joy his
[18:12] peace all of that begin to degrade till
[18:15] he became a separated alienated being
[18:18] from
[18:20] God and that's what Jesus came to do to
[18:23] restore all of that to restore to con
[18:28] make us
[18:30] perfect but he remained the same God's
[18:34] love is
[18:37] perfect and that that's why that's why
[18:41] God did what he had to
[18:43] do the greatest one of the greatest and
[18:46] one of the well-known scriptures is for
[18:48] God so loved the world that he gave his
[18:50] only begotten son that whosoever
[18:51] believeth in him should not perish but
[18:54] have everlasting life amen God loved us
[18:59] God looked for us we were the ones
[19:03] hiding that's right we were when we out
[19:06] of our mother's womb we are ready to run
[19:10] from God we don't have anything to do
[19:12] with God it's God the one calling God is
[19:15] the one seeking God is the one crying
[19:18] out for his people and and and the
[19:21] Beautiful Thing is the
[19:23] greatest act that God ever demonstrated
[19:26] was Jesus dying on that cross coming
[19:29] down to this earth to save the world and
[19:31] by that act conviction comes into our
[19:36] hearts that that's the amazing thing
[19:38] because sometimes in our mind fear has
[19:41] to be the driving point to come to
[19:44] Christ a lot of times fear is the one
[19:47] that makes us want to do
[19:49] right fear is the one that we have to be
[19:53] perfect so we begin to modify we begin
[19:56] to act we begin to be right when fear is
[20:00] the one that pushes us away in the first
[20:02] place yes good so so we have to
[20:06] understand that the reason why we have a
[20:08] desire for God is because he first loved
[20:11] me he first came down and he died for us
[20:15] and now he's knocking at the heart of
[20:17] the people and because of that love
[20:20] conviction comes
[20:22] in and then his word comes in opens up
[20:25] the heart and says hey man I'm not where
[20:28] I'm supposed to to be but there there's
[20:31] no condemnation there the next verse he
[20:34] said he didn't come to condemn the
[20:37] world he didn't come to cause
[20:42] condemnation that was the greatest act
[20:44] and it brings conviction to the heart
[20:47] it's not
[20:49] rules it's not preaching fear Into the
[20:52] Heart of the
[20:53] people people should not be brought by
[20:55] fear of condemnation
[20:59] a lot of times that that's how we're
[21:01] brought in not nobody even has to tell
[21:03] us sometimes we just do it ourselves
[21:07] we're the best preachers to
[21:09] ourselves we begin to think uh
[21:12] condemning thoughts on how unworthy we
[21:14] are and we try to become a Christian
[21:18] when it'll never work we try to become
[21:21] perfect where it'll never work it has to
[21:24] be by the grace of God in Romans 2:4 it
[21:28] says or despises thou The Riches of the
[21:31] goodness and forbearance and
[21:34] longsuffering not knowing that the
[21:36] goodness of God leadth thee to
[21:39] repentance so your the start of your
[21:43] Christian walk is God's
[21:45] goodness the reason why we repent from
[21:48] our sins is because of the goodness of
[21:52] God brother Bram he says in from that
[21:55] time he says that's why many people join
[21:57] churches because they fear hell and they
[22:01] come and put their names on the book and
[22:03] they go out and they think that settles
[22:04] it but it doesn't it's not long lasting
[22:09] all those things are temporal but there
[22:11] is a time when a certain thing can
[22:13] happen and from then on it's different
[22:17] really different that's when man meets
[22:19] God things change when man meets
[22:22] God so that's there there's the
[22:25] difference there that
[22:29] that we can never come to God or we can
[22:32] never be perfected we can never be
[22:34] matured through fear it'll never happen
[22:38] through a fear of condemnation through a
[22:40] fear of
[22:41] imperfection we we have to understand
[22:44] that this perfecting Love Is it is a
[22:49] confidence toward God and not looking
[22:53] within me and not looking overanalyzing
[22:56] and becoming OCD of my Christian walk
[23:00] but it's looking towards
[23:02] him it's getting a relationship and what
[23:06] is this every time you read your Bible
[23:08] every time you hear the word every time
[23:10] the word opens to you there's a deeper a
[23:13] deeper and a deeper love towards him the
[23:17] more you're in his presence the more you
[23:19] know
[23:21] him now now there there's a difference
[23:23] between the impact of sin and inherited
[23:26] sin see I was thinking about Adam how he
[23:29] he sinned and that was an impact of
[23:33] sin but he was still the Son of God he
[23:35] was still a direction of God he was
[23:40] spoken out of the words of
[23:43] God but what got him and what crippled
[23:46] him was the impact of
[23:48] sin but from him to people After the
[23:53] flood a complete different kind of
[23:56] people because now these people people
[23:58] are not only just direct sons of God but
[24:01] they're made like brother Brandon would
[24:03] always say uh what is it born in sin
[24:05] shaped in
[24:07] iniquity come to this world speaking
[24:09] lies they inherited sin through the seed
[24:13] through a corrupted seed so now it's
[24:16] it's completely
[24:17] different it's a completely uh different
[24:20] thing and and you can see the difference
[24:23] and a lot of times you could see Adam
[24:25] and that's sometimes how a born again
[24:27] believer acts because now when somebody
[24:30] is Born Again they're a direct son and
[24:33] daughter of God they're not just from
[24:36] the corruptible seed but they're they're
[24:38] from an Incorruptible seed now but if we
[24:42] don't be careful our First Act is to
[24:45] hide
[24:46] run
[24:48] fear get
[24:51] scared and and also there there's a a
[24:54] difference between struggling with sin
[24:57] and and being a slave or giving into
[25:01] sin here if you'd like to turn with me
[25:04] to Romans
[25:11] 78 and we'll read to 23 and the whole
[25:14] chapter is just a chapter of just golden
[25:17] nuggets and I'm sure we've all heard it
[25:19] brother brenham's preached about
[25:21] it he says for I know that in me that is
[25:26] in my flesh dwell no good thing so
[25:31] that's one first thing that we got to
[25:33] know that in me that is my flesh
[25:36] dwelleth no good
[25:38] thing for to will is present within me
[25:41] for how to perform that which is good I
[25:44] find not for the good that I would that
[25:48] um that I would I do not but the evil
[25:52] that I would not that I do for if I do
[25:55] that I would not it is more it is no no
[25:58] more I that do it but the sin that
[26:00] dwelleth in
[26:02] me so you got to remember you're not
[26:05] talking this is not a a novice re
[26:08] writing this to us now this is not
[26:11] somebody that just gave their heart to
[26:13] the Lord you're talking about the
[26:15] prophet of the age the Apostle and he
[26:19] says it is not me that I do that that
[26:22] does this but it's sin that dwells in me
[26:28] that's why we love that story about the
[26:30] Indian they said well how does it feel
[26:33] after you receive the Holy Ghost two
[26:34] dogs right that dwell in
[26:37] me so we always have to understand sin
[26:41] dwells in
[26:45] me he said but the sin that dwelleth in
[26:48] me I find then a
[26:51] law that when I would do good evil is
[26:54] present with
[26:56] me for I Delight in the law of God after
[27:01] the inward man but I see another law in
[27:03] my members Waring against the law of my
[27:06] mind and bringing me into
[27:08] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[27:11] my members now first of all like I said
[27:15] Paul is speaking
[27:16] autobiographically he's talking about
[27:19] himself demonstrating that there is a
[27:21] struggle of sin within even the greatest
[27:25] Christians that every Christian
[27:29] now this is breaking news every
[27:32] Christian struggles with
[27:34] sin we can't say oh I'm
[27:37] perfect every Christian struggles with
[27:42] sin now like I said there is a
[27:44] difference between struggling and giving
[27:47] in he said that which I do not
[27:51] like in other in other versions that
[27:53] which I hate I do and that which I
[27:57] desire I don't
[27:59] do so so there's a difference between
[28:02] giving in because a lot of Sinners and
[28:04] unbelievers and professed Christians can
[28:06] come and say oh I'm going through the
[28:08] same thing yeah sin dwells in me pretty
[28:11] bad but they love
[28:13] it oh they love that sin they love doing
[28:17] those
[28:18] things but a Christian one of those
[28:21] green trees as brother Aaron was talking
[28:23] about somebody that has been bought into
[28:27] the body of of Christ right somebody
[28:30] that is a child of God that is growing
[28:33] up to the
[28:34] maturity they hate
[28:37] sin and they're not just giving into sin
[28:40] they we understand that sin dwells in us
[28:43] but there's a fight there's a struggle
[28:45] there's a war going on in US am there's
[28:48] a
[28:49] struggling that's why Paul he's you can
[28:52] see how torny he is oh Wretched Man that
[28:55] I am who's going to deliver me right he
[28:59] he's telling us this whole situation
[29:01] saying there there's a struggle of
[29:04] sin and this is showing that there that
[29:07] Christians Believers Sons and Daughters
[29:10] of God are in a progression to maturity
[29:13] to
[29:15] adoption there's a progression so
[29:17] there's always going to be a fight
[29:19] progression doesn't it means that
[29:21] there's still sin there and it doesn't
[29:24] mean oh well well there's sin well
[29:28] what can we do no we we see the sin in
[29:31] our lives and and we're fighting for
[29:33] dear
[29:34] life there there's a Waring against the
[29:37] the spiritual man and the carnal
[29:40] man it's not a green light to say okay
[29:44] it's fine but there's there's it's a
[29:45] wrestling with
[29:48] sin and and it's revealing that
[29:52] Christians they hate sin and desire
[29:57] righteousness shows a progression to
[30:00] Perfection that it's it's not anything
[30:04] else but a growing and and a putting
[30:07] away of our
[30:09] lives and and sometimes now we're going
[30:12] back to condemnation the result of the
[30:15] fact that the Christians struggle with
[30:17] sin when I say struggle we're fighting
[30:21] right sometimes that's what causes the
[30:24] feeling of
[30:26] condemnation feeling
[30:30] inadequacy feeling like Adam see
[30:33] Adam that was justified for him to
[30:37] fear but now we inherit
[30:41] sin now it's in our flesh brother B says
[30:44] we we have a culber
[30:46] nature we can it means it's I don't know
[30:49] if you've ever seen a cber it's
[30:51] sticky you you get CL close enough to
[30:54] the world it's going to jump on you
[30:59] so so now now we're fighting with this
[31:02] flesh now we're fighting with these
[31:04] things and a lot of times the the
[31:07] understanding that we are struggling
[31:08] with sin causes
[31:11] condemnation saying oh God I'm not
[31:14] worthy oh God I'm still being
[31:17] tempted
[31:19] Temptation Jesus was
[31:22] tempted but sometimes we feel like the
[31:24] Temptation that's where condemnation
[31:26] comes and and we always we have to
[31:29] understand the difference between
[31:30] conviction and condemnation yes amen we
[31:33] have to understand that every time God
[31:35] will convict your heart is to bring you
[31:38] closer and if if we ever get a
[31:41] condemning thought we have to understand
[31:43] that's not coming from
[31:45] God if we ever hear the word we ever
[31:48] hear the gospel and we feel condemned
[31:50] we're hearing the wrong
[31:53] gospel right if we ever feel condemned
[31:57] from hearing the word something's wrong
[32:00] because the Bible says Jesus didn't come
[32:02] to condemn but he came so that we might
[32:06] be
[32:07] saved condemnation judgment is for that
[32:12] day there is a judgment going
[32:16] on but if there's there's a conviction
[32:20] if there's a light over our sin God's
[32:23] always going to find a give you a way
[32:26] back he's always going to give you a way
[32:28] to
[32:29] overcome he's conviction is a reproof or
[32:33] a shedding light of sin saying hey we're
[32:36] wrong but this is the way to go this is
[32:39] the way to go conviction is not always
[32:42] just hurting but it is being led by the
[32:45] spirit of the
[32:48] Lord we're not
[32:50] careful we we what happens is we we
[32:55] start basing our religion in a condemn
[32:58] based
[32:59] religion punishment judgment based
[33:02] religion and what happens is that's
[33:05] where Works come in I I believe that's
[33:08] where uh how the Pharisees they
[33:10] perfected the law why because it's like
[33:14] we're going to we're going to create
[33:15] another law and we're going to do this
[33:17] and what happens is we try to perfect
[33:21] ourselves and and and for for a while
[33:24] we're feeling condemned but we get good
[33:26] enough at it we become a
[33:28] Pharisee we say if if they can't live up
[33:32] to what I live they're not they're not
[33:35] saved that's what happened to the
[33:37] Pharisees they said if they can't live
[33:39] up to our
[33:41] Traditions if that person can't live up
[33:43] then they're not saved what were they
[33:45] they were creating laws to perfect
[33:48] themselves they were self-modifying
[33:50] their
[33:52] perfection and a lot of times if if if
[33:55] we go in this D demned based
[33:58] relationship or religion that's what
[34:01] will end up happening if we get good at
[34:03] it we get good at trying to fix ourself
[34:06] trying to be better trying to be better
[34:07] but this this is
[34:10] Grace this is a a process of knowing the
[34:14] Eternal one a process of knowing him and
[34:18] then you become
[34:21] him condemnation is the definition is to
[34:25] be judged to be found guilty
[34:28] and has already been
[34:31] sentenced there's no way
[34:34] out Paul begins to explain the
[34:38] impossibility of self-modification
[34:40] in Romans 7:14 he says for we know that
[34:45] the law is spiritual but I am carnal
[34:49] sold under
[34:51] sin that tells you everything brother
[34:55] brandham says that Jesus didn't come to
[34:57] destroy the law but he came to magnify
[34:59] the law that's right it doesn't mean
[35:01] that he added more all what is a magnif
[35:04] magnifying glass it just brings it
[35:06] closer he said you thought if you go and
[35:09] you stab somebody you've murdered
[35:11] somebody but he's like no if you hate
[35:13] them it goes so deep it goes into our
[35:17] very
[35:17] thoughts so so the the law is so
[35:21] spiritual and my body is so carnal I am
[35:24] sold under sin I cannot live this life I
[35:27] cannot modify myself to be
[35:29] perfect I need
[35:32] somebody he says in 7 721 so he's
[35:36] talking about this law the law of God
[35:39] then he says in seh Romans 7:21-23 he
[35:42] says then I find a law he's talking
[35:45] about another law laws are what
[35:47] principles guidelines
[35:50] rules that's why we can think about the
[35:52] law of gravity you cannot go against the
[35:55] law of gravity there's laws there's
[35:57] principles within
[36:00] that and it's the same thing with the
[36:02] laws of God the they principles or
[36:05] things that you can't go but now he's
[36:07] saying there's different kinds of laws
[36:09] here now he says then I find a law that
[36:12] when I do good evil is present with me
[36:15] yeah for I Delight in the law of God
[36:18] after the inward man but I see another
[36:21] law in my members Waring against the law
[36:25] of my mind bringing me into the
[36:26] Captivity to the law of sin which are in
[36:29] my which is in my
[36:31] members now that he's showing why
[36:34] there's a struggle with sin because
[36:36] there's a law within
[36:38] us we can never live up because we can't
[36:42] go past those guidelines of our flesh
[36:46] there's a law within our flesh don't
[36:48] that does not allow us to live up to the
[36:52] law of
[36:53] God it doesn't allow it there there's a
[36:55] struggle that's warn against the inward
[36:58] man and those two laws are always going
[37:01] to fight against one
[37:03] another and the reason why I'm saying
[37:05] this is so that we can understand that
[37:08] sin dwelleth in us that there is a
[37:12] struggle but we can look forward and we
[37:15] can have
[37:16] confidence in God we can have confidence
[37:20] in his love showing that yes we are
[37:23] always going to see the mirror and we're
[37:24] going to see imperfection but when God
[37:27] sees us there's a Perfection there
[37:32] amen he says but remember this even as
[37:36] we
[37:37] are if You' like to turn in
[37:40] John
[37:45] 4:17 this is what what I I
[37:48] truly love here he says herein is our
[37:52] love made perfect that we have boldness
[37:55] in the day of judgment that's future
[37:58] tense then he goes into present he says
[38:03] because as he
[38:05] is so are we in this
[38:10] world so we look in the mirror we see
[38:14] imperfection we look within ourselves
[38:16] we're going to see
[38:18] faults we're going to see indwelling sin
[38:21] but here John is saying so as he
[38:24] is we are in the world
[38:28] so whatever condition Jesus Christ is in
[38:33] today even though we're imperfect even
[38:35] though we're probably a little anger
[38:37] fit's going to hit or or maybe we'll do
[38:39] a white lie without even knowing maybe
[38:41] we'll we'll something will happen where
[38:43] we'll Fall
[38:44] Again One Way or Another as he is there
[38:49] so are
[38:51] we that we are reflecting the very
[38:54] character of him right
[38:55] now even though we we are imperfect even
[38:58] though we are in a progression we're
[39:01] still when they see us they see
[39:04] him there's still something that looks
[39:08] like him doesn't merely encourage us to
[39:11] inspire to be like him but he asserts
[39:14] that we already
[39:16] are by virtue of our faith while we
[39:19] might not be perfect copies every
[39:22] Christian inherently Bears some kind of
[39:24] resemblance to
[39:26] Christ we're going to Bear Christ one
[39:29] way or
[39:30] another I started to think about that
[39:32] and um I don't know if anybody's ever
[39:34] heard the private interview of of sister
[39:38] Bruce um
[39:40] where he's talking to the
[39:43] sister and in her she feels
[39:48] condemned and brother Brenham is
[39:51] explaining to her who she
[39:54] is here brother brandham he says I
[39:57] believe with all of my heart that you
[39:59] are a real Born Again believer sister
[40:02] Bruce imagine hearing the prophet say
[40:05] that you're a real born born again
[40:07] believer sometimes we need that
[40:09] confidence we need that
[40:12] reassurance how could how could that
[40:15] Spirit just leave when you get sick when
[40:18] you get weary and when you're nervous
[40:20] type of person sister Bruce says yes see
[40:25] and you get those things on your mind
[40:28] see little bitty things and it just
[40:30] keeps building up both ways and you get
[40:32] somebody on your heart and you want to
[40:34] pray for them and get and uh get up and
[40:37] pray for it you can't rest until that
[40:39] person's prayed for that's you then take
[40:43] on the other side Sayan might present
[40:45] something um that you and out this way
[40:49] see then God your nature God works Satan
[40:53] works then Satan tries to make you
[40:56] believe
[40:58] that you are
[41:00] not see you keep building this and maybe
[41:04] this and this see you don't look at
[41:06] yourself sister Bruce
[41:08] remember so he's telling her like this
[41:10] is how how it works and sometimes
[41:13] Satan's going to come
[41:15] around and go into that character and go
[41:17] into that little gift of yours he's
[41:20] talking about a gift that she has that
[41:22] she just not settled until she gets to
[41:25] pray for somebody
[41:27] but then he says on the other hand Satan
[41:29] will come and say o you're not that
[41:32] person you're saying to be you're not
[41:37] saved good and and he goes on and he
[41:41] says I'm going to pray for you
[41:43] now and and he's telling her all of
[41:46] these things and she goes back and tells
[41:49] him sister Bruce says I make so many
[41:53] mistakes imagine somebody assuring you
[41:56] and still say saying wait hold on but
[41:58] I'm still imperfect
[41:59] somehow I make so many mistakes and I
[42:03] fail so many times brother brandham goes
[42:06] back and he says that's why Christ had
[42:09] to die so that you with your mistakes
[42:12] wouldn't be lotted to you seeu he took
[42:16] your mistakes your desire in your heart
[42:19] is to serve
[42:21] him brothers sisters that's the
[42:24] key he says oh there's indwell ing sin
[42:27] in me but I
[42:30] desire the law I desire to do right even
[42:34] though my members which is my body
[42:36] sometimes doesn't want
[42:38] to but yet my desire that's what makes
[42:41] you different from the rest of the world
[42:44] is your
[42:46] desire and and if you continue on the
[42:48] devil's going to try to make you fall
[42:50] but remember Lord you know my
[42:53] desire Lord you know my heart
[42:57] he says that your desire in your heart
[43:00] is to serve him sister Bruce says yes
[43:04] all right that's what he died for so you
[43:07] could serve him see not your mistakes
[43:10] are not looked not lotted to you see
[43:13] he's your propitiation see he's your sin
[43:16] offering your sins are not known you're
[43:20] not a
[43:21] sinner praise God you're not a
[43:24] sinner praise God I'm just growing
[43:28] sometimes we fall but we're growing and
[43:31] just like I I've been rejoicing with
[43:34] those those messages because the
[43:36] youngans have to grow
[43:38] up we're going to fall but we grow into
[43:41] a
[43:42] maturity into a confidence into a
[43:45] perfecting Faith perfecting love all of
[43:48] these complexes breaking away until one
[43:51] of these days we're stepping into the
[43:54] day of judgment with boldness right oh
[43:57] God oh that's that's what I want that's
[44:00] what we're walking
[44:02] towards he says you're not a sinner
[44:05] before God Christ took your sins and he
[44:08] became you cuz your desire is to serve
[44:12] him first
[44:14] John 3:20 20 uh and 21 it says for our
[44:19] heart if our heart condemns us he is
[44:22] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[44:25] things amen
[44:27] if our heart condemns us he's
[44:30] greater he actually he actually started
[44:34] to tell sister Bruce he said sister
[44:37] Bruce you think
[44:39] I he said you you think I you you have
[44:44] been under the vision that's what he
[44:46] says you've been under a vision I know
[44:49] who you
[44:50] are and
[44:52] sometimes we have to understand that God
[44:55] is a perfect and better judge than our
[44:58] own
[44:59] conscience that our our conscience is
[45:01] going to condemn us but we have a better
[45:05] judge and he's saying don't you think I
[45:08] know who you are don't you think I know
[45:11] that you're struggling with this but
[45:13] your desire is
[45:15] this he is a better
[45:18] judge it's the difference between an
[45:21] imperfect judge called her conscience
[45:23] and
[45:24] omniscience you cannot compare your cons
[45:27] with
[45:28] him if our hearts condemn us remember he
[45:32] knows our heart he knows who you are if
[45:36] the conscience condemns us it verdict is
[45:39] neither infallible nor final right we
[45:42] can still appeal to God who's greater
[45:45] than our heart because he's the maker of
[45:47] it am he has the power over it and the
[45:51] management of it and his hands and um
[45:54] and it's in his hands and he is the
[45:56] Searcher and tri of it he is a greater
[45:58] witness than the conscience and a
[46:01] superior judge than
[46:04] it he's greater than our conscience he's
[46:06] greater than our heart he's greater than
[46:08] what we think we
[46:10] are so that fear sometimes it it's a
[46:15] self-imposed fear because God remember
[46:17] there is no
[46:20] condemnation there is no condemnation
[46:22] through Christ Jesus to those that are
[46:24] in Christ Jesus
[46:29] here
[46:32] in 1 John 4:17 he says I'm just going to
[46:36] reread it he
[46:41] says here in is our love made perfect
[46:43] that we have boldness in the day of
[46:47] judgment now brother brandham he
[46:50] says and if you look at
[46:53] Revelations
[46:54] 1:17 John was transmitted to the aisle
[46:57] of
[46:58] Patmos in the spirit over in the Lord's
[47:02] day this is the day of men men are
[47:05] fighting but the day of the Lord will
[47:07] come when these kingdoms will become the
[47:09] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[47:11] and there will be a great Millennium the
[47:14] Lord's Day the day of his coming his
[47:17] judgment that'll be the Lord's
[47:20] day so now you're talking about this man
[47:23] that he said that we hearing our is made
[47:28] perfect it's been matured that we have
[47:31] boldness in the day of
[47:34] judgment then two two books after that
[47:37] you see them transmitted into that very
[47:40] day in front of the very
[47:43] judge and Revelations 1:17 he says and
[47:46] when I saw him this one that had the
[47:50] white wig the one with the eyes as
[47:53] flames of fire the ones with the feet of
[47:55] brass now he's standing in front of
[47:57] him let's see how he acts let's see if
[48:01] he has
[48:02] boldness he says when I saw him I fell
[48:05] at his feet as
[48:07] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[48:10] saying fear
[48:12] not he's saying fear not I am the first
[48:16] and the
[48:17] last so even though John he said one day
[48:21] we'll be perfect where we can stand
[48:23] right in front of the judge he stood in
[48:26] front of the judge
[48:27] and he fell condemnation hit him fear
[48:31] hit him because he was in front of the
[48:33] judge but he is a greater judge than we
[48:36] are so then he reassured him and he says
[48:40] fear not
[48:41] John don't you think I know who you
[48:44] are he says I am the greater judge I am
[48:48] the ultimate
[48:49] judg even though John felt condemnation
[48:53] even though he felt fear and fell at his
[48:55] feet or fell at his face John or God he
[48:58] put his right hand on him and he said
[49:01] fear
[49:04] not brother brandham he says in closing
[49:07] he says no human could
[49:10] stand the full V the effect of the
[49:13] vision his strength utterly Gone John
[49:16] fell at his feet though as dead but the
[49:20] hand of the Lord in love touched
[49:23] him you're talking about the most
[49:26] terrifying form of God you're talking
[49:29] about the most terrifying day yet when
[49:33] he touched him it was in
[49:35] love why because John was somebody no
[49:38] because he was his
[49:41] child that's how God deals with
[49:45] us he says but the hand of of the Lord
[49:50] in love touched him and the voice of
[49:51] blessing said fear not don't be afraid I
[49:56] am the first and the last and I am he
[49:59] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[50:02] alive Evermore what is to fear the
[50:07] Judgment fell upon him at the cross at
[50:11] the grave and when he descended it was
[50:13] for us he absorbed the full brunt of the
[50:17] wound of sin and there and um there is
[50:21] therefore now no condemnation to them
[50:24] which are in Christ Jesus see for the
[50:28] shity our attorney is our judge he is
[50:33] both attorney and judge as judge the
[50:37] case is settled it is finished now there
[50:40] now therefore no condemnation why should
[50:43] the church
[50:45] fear what promise has he ever failed to
[50:48] manifest before us why should it fear
[50:51] punishment or death it has been overcome
[50:56] he he is the mighty
[50:58] conqueror and first John if You' like to
[51:02] T stand with me First John
[51:06] 3 21 it says beloved if our hearts
[51:09] condemn us not then we have confidence
[51:12] toward
[51:13] God if it condemns us he's
[51:17] greater but there's a point where if our
[51:19] hearts do not condemn us we have the
[51:23] confidence towards God
[51:27] brother Branham he
[51:29] says now watch Jesus with the bride as
[51:32] the king and queen sat at the throne the
[51:35] white Throne judgment the books were
[51:38] open and the books of the Sinners and
[51:40] the books and another book was open
[51:42] which was the book of life and every man
[51:44] was judged thus by the bride know ye not
[51:48] taking these little matters before the
[51:50] law know ye not that the Saints shall
[51:53] judge the Earth see see all right
[51:57] will'll be there and we'll be like
[51:59] him we see him and we're not going to
[52:02] fall like John see John was still in the
[52:05] progression but there'll be a point
[52:07] where we'll be we'll see him we'll take
[52:11] his hand and we the Saints will judge
[52:14] the
[52:16] Earth let us bow our
[52:18] heads Heavenly
[52:20] Father Lord I just ask that you bless
[52:24] each and every person here

[52:38] just as the accuser and the father of

[52:56] showing that you loved us and because

[53:04] ourselves but because of you every

[53:12] your help Father and I ask Lord that you
