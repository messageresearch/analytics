TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'd like to continue on the subject of the kingdom and we've been speaking about two Edens for the last few services tonight my title is the devil's lie versus the truth of God and I'm taking that phrasing directly from the message of the hour uh the phrase the devil's lie as it opposes or is against the truth of God and I feel in some ways I'm dropping back a little bit just covering something that's a fundamental principle and as I've been looking at things in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and been studying in different places I realize there's some things that are real foundational and principles that relate to the word of God that would be really good for us to understand before we go further and so I'm just kind of laying a a necessary Foundation tonight and but a lot of what we're going to use to do that is things that we've already been covering over the last few services or several services for that matter and uh to give some placing for the title The Devil's lie versus the truth of God in the church age book brother Branham referring to Babel in Babylon he said the devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that City so there's the Tower of Babel is what we're thinking about we're thinking about the beginning of Babylon and he says the devil's lie knows the singular lie gives rise to a lot of mysteries the devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries rise up against so it's versus it's combating it's suing it's a it's opposing the truth of God and the mysteries of God he says it's in that City and recall how brother Branham talked about the two Edens and he used Matthew 24 24 to introduce the two Edens and he said the end time these two Edens will be so close together that if it were possible the false Eden would trick the believer into thinking that it was the true Eden and so there's going to be in Eden there's going to be a city there's going to be a woman that will appear righteous and holy and of God and the Bride of Jesus Christ but yet she's not going to be that she's going to be that false Christ the the analogy of the tares or even we could say uh however example you want to use they're all part of that City that brother Brown's talking about here that is the devil's lie in the devil's Mysteries that rise up against God in that City we could use the phrase the beast at the beginning and it's the beast at the beginning that brought forth nimrod's Kingdom and it was in opposition to God in opposition to God's word and it's the beast at the end that brings forth Satan's Eden and it's the beast that's giving power it's the beast that's raising up and it's what brings forth Satan Eden Satan's Eden and think of it this way what begins as a tower and begins as a kingdom uh there in the Middle East and there in a very specific area by the river Euphrates it starts there but by the time it's done in Babylon encompasses the whole Earth so when God brother Branham is describing Satan's Eden and he's using the Book of Revelation to describe it he's not just pointing to a a seat where a kingdom has originated and exist in one area and it's only expanded in that region it's now the whole world the whole world has become a kingdom unto Satan and as brother Brandon says in a church age book thus the mysteries of Babylon spread from Nation to Nation until it appeared in Rome and China India and even in both North and South America we find the very same basic worship so the Tower of Babel Grew From one tower that was trying to rise up uh to the heavens and now it grows to mystery Babylon of Revelations chapter 17 and chapter 18. it's much bigger much broader than just one Tower where all the people of the Earth had gathered and we've been contrasting the two Edens God's Eden and Satan's Eden and we found uh the contrast and we could see the contrast and the comparison of the two cities that come up in the Book of Revelation and there's the city that we've looked at as mystery Babylon and then at the end we see the New Jerusalem and I'm having a hard time hearing your amens over all my fans tonight so I want to I want to I want to hear your amens but it's the mystery Babylon is the one city and then the other city is the New Jerusalem the the mystery Babylon is the culmination of Satan's kingdom the New Jerusalem is the culmination of the kingdom and so it's it's just neat how these things arise up at the very end and Satan's kingdom when it's come to its Perfection it's come to the Perfection of its beauty if you want to use that phrasing Satan's kingdom scripturally is described as a harlot uh it's a woman it's a harlot not called The Bride not called the wife but it's called it's a woman and it's symbolized as a harlot but then God's kingdom is represented as a bride and so despite and I think that in itself is something to really think about how that Satan's kingdom is referred to as a woman God's kingdom is referred to as a woman but the Bible says this one's a harlot and this one's a bride this one's Unfaithful this one's faithful this one's unrighteous this one is righteous but yet despite what we could say is the apparent disparity in scripture between a harlot and a bride Satan's kingdom is deceptively beautiful the Bible's telling us she's full of fornications and she's full of this but yet John when he sees her he wonders at her and she's a Marvel and he's gazing at her of her power and all the things that she has and so just by looking at it maybe you couldn't tell the difference but the Bible says within is death and what it carries and what it has is deadly so despite the fact that the scripture describes them in ways that they're complete opposites in the last days that mimikwed the terror will grow to a place that at a certain point it's going to look just like the wheat but it's deadly so as we mentioned in at the very start how the Devils lie and the devil's Mysteries rolls up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that City the devil's life produces the devil's many Mysteries so it's the devil's lies that produce Mysteries and so if you just have an appetite for Mysteries the devil can satisfy that and so the devil's life produces his many different Mysteries and it's that Antichrist Spirit working against the truth it's the and what we're looking at is the devil's method of operation this is the devil's tactic and how he uses lies to create Mysteries and it's always by lies It's Always by deception and so in that City it's the devil's lies and the devil the devil's lie and the devil's Mysteries that rise up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God if you look at Genesis chapter 3 verse 4 I think I'll read this for you then come to verse 5. as we look at the serpent in the beginning and this is now Satan uh motivating and animating The Serpent and it says the serpent said unto the woman I know I'm jumping into the middle of the conversation but you can go read the tweets later he says you shall not surely die and that we know that's an absolute lie that the the devil's saying you shall not surely die and this seems to be some inspiration there seems to be some take this is his interpretation of the promise and it's here that we could begin to recognize the principle that where there seems to be an offer of inspiration or explanation or truth that what we do as Believers is we bring it back to the word and we find somebody said well if the Satan says that you shall surely die then you could bring it back to the truth and say well that's exactly what God Said So I'm not believing it because you said it but I can take it back to the word and so if we look at it this way I was asking myself this past week you know what's what makes a lie and 99 of Allah's composition can be things that are true we can say 99.9 perhaps but 99 of a lies composition in other words what makes up a lie 99 of it can be things that are true true facts uh verifiable you know uh you know supported by evidence and Witnesses and there can be a lot of things that add up and say well this is so a lie can contain things that are uh 90 of it can be things that are true and I'll even uh offer this that the truth can be used in such a way to deceive where we speak the truth but yet we frame it in a way we we use it in a way that is intending to uh to mislead so something true but used to lead you away from truth is still a lie you take you take something that's true and you and you use it in such a way to you're trying to deceive and so you're maybe you're you're running off to go uh meet your buddy for dinner and your wife calls you and says what time are you gonna be home for dinner so I'm not sure yet and she says well what are you doing he says I'm just driving by Home Depot real quick hey and you are you're going by Home Depot real quick and and you use the truth in a way to try to mislead your wife into thinking that you're not having a hot wings somewhere and filling your belly up before you get home and say I'm not really that hungry and you have to force yourself to eat and this has never happened to me thank God but the discernment is working tonight you Brothers you better watch out but it's it's using it's using something that's true in a way to mislead somebody from what you're actually doing so facts and figures and statistics and Science and things that may be true can still be lies in themselves if the motive of it is to take you away from truth so when this when Satan says you shall not surely die uh we kind of break that down to say it's just one word three letters not is what makes it a line look at the next part though in verse five for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened you shall be shall be his Gods knowing Good and Evil now he continues he says you shall not surely die and he continues to express himself and give his interpretation and in verse 7 after they eat the very words of the scripture says the eyes of them both were opened and they knew so the devil's lie was oh you shall not surely die for God doth know that the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened you shall be as God's knowing and then when they do it the very thing that he said what happens happened their eyes are open and they both knew then in Genesis 3 22 the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil so the devil's lie produced exactly what he said it would he said that you shall not surely die but God knows when you eat your eyes will be opened you'll become as God's knowing good and evil and the Bible says yeah as soon as they open their eyes were opened and they knew good and evil and God says they become as one of us so this is the devil's lie then is settings for things and expressing things that are akin to truth I know this is um I don't think it's treacherous what I'm doing but brother Bram does say teaching can be treacherous and so I realize these things we have to focus very intently tonight on this Satan took God's truth and perverted it ever so slightly and if you read verse 22 and you compare it to what the devil has already said it would appear as if God's quoting the serpent and it would appear as if he is affirming the devil's inspiration or that he is the devil says oh no God knows that when you eat your eyes will be opened you'll become like him and and you will know good from Evil and so when God says behold the man has become a God and his eyes are open to no good and even said well that's what the serpent said and there's a it would seem like this is part of the devil's inspiration yet what the devil said was true and what God Said was true but there's a difference and I'm not just talking about semantics or how you spell it and I think that this is an important one but I don't think we should get lost in it and all of a sudden Arizona Believers Church becomes the the Church of the truth and everyone else is the Church of the true and and somehow we've got to get our language just in there where we get the right but there is a difference between something being true and the truth and if it would help you capitalize the truth if that would help you just capitalize the truth let me give you an example with respect to water baptism in Matthew 28 19 it says go you into all the world baptize in them in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost that's true that's what Jesus said it's what he asked him to do that's true but the truth of it in Acts 2 38 is go into the one baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus that's the truth of Matthew 28 19. so Matthew 28 19 is true they have the rev the understanding of it is in baptize the name of Lord Jesus Christ so we we can look at it and recognize that yes one is true but the truth of it was greater than what was true and so the truth is not just something true the truth is deeper the the Devil May the Devil May repeat something and it may be true but the truth of it is going to be deeper maybe things that could be presented in a way to express a uh this is true and we think oh that's the truth but the truth isn't always just what's on the in the letter it's just not what's there on the face of it it's not just what's there in the black and white but there's some Revelation to it that makes it the truth now I know that there we heard the example of reading between the lines and what I found a lot of people use that quote to mean that they're interpreting the white space and if you look at it long enough you'll see things that brother Branham said between the lines it's like no to read between the lines is to know what's in the lines when something is said and you're reading between the lines it means you're catching the thought and the truth of what's being said and and maybe not just the letter of it but what the meaning was behind it and we could go even into the original sin we could say the original sin was Disobedience by partaking of a forbidden fruit and that's true but we know the truth is deeper there there's uh there's a depth that someone can have oh this is true and we could accept it as true but the truth is what you want and I know that may just seem to be uh semantics but hopefully we can just make that makes more sense tonight as we go forward so the devil's lie can be 99 things that are true but it was the one percent that caused death the devil's lie can be 99 of things that are true and not be the truth now in second Thessalonians chapter 2 and we'll read to verse um we'll start with verse 10 and read to verse 13 but as you read as you look at that whole reading in from verses three to nine he's talking about power signs and lying wonders of the wicked of the Antichrist and how it's going to deceive and this is where he's using all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth unrighteousness is righteousness perverted there may be some elements of the unrighteousness that too the one who's perishing or the one that's deceived thinks that it's righteousness there's enough there's enough in the elements to where they're not just wholesale uh swallowing Satan remember in using the devil voice that we think he sounds like versus the voice that he probably has you realize that the one we're falling for and the one that we're tempted by isn't the one that has the Deep grovelry demonic voice since they received they perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved so salvation is in loving truth and it says and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie a light not just lies but they're going to believe a lie they're going to believe the devil's lie against the truth of God and in believing that lie they they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness there's that enjoyment of and this is even a religious wickedness they enjoy the unrighteousness thinking to themselves that they are in righteousness that they're right he says he sits in the temple of God and being worshiped as God so those that are being deceived in unrighteousness they're not in the temple of Satan they believe that they're worshiping the one who's in the temple of God and being worshiped as God even to the point where the capital G is being used here in second Thessalonians 2. and then Paul switches but we are bound to give thanks all way to God for you brother and beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning what a contrast from those who are deceived into unrighteousness who receive not the love of the truth so they perish God sends strong delusion that they're going to believe a lie they're all going to be damned but then there's salvation for others and he says God chose you to this salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth now as God says that the strong delusion will cause them to believe a lie the LIE may be 99 true but the one percent is what keeps it from being truth I'm going to keep repeating myself because I think it's all going to click here in a little bit a lie the LIE can be 99 true but it's the part that's missing that's misinterpreted or that's the contradiction that keeps it from being truth so even though it might be 99 true if there's anything in it that contradicts that's what makes it a lie the LIE is in the contradiction John chapter 8 verse 44 he says you are of your father the devil in the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him that's a remarkable statement if we take it all the way back to Lucifer we take it back to Satan he cannot abide in truth there is no truth in him so he can he can speak things and he can say things but he's not a source of Truth remember a lie can only exist in the context of Truth you only have a lie because there's something that it opposes there's something that it changes so there is no truth in him when he speaketh the LIE he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it this is the image of Satan in the very beginning he is a murderer he is a speaker of lies he's the father of lies he's the father of murder and he is a murderer of Truth something that he opposes something that he's against and he will use things that are true to try and deceive it says that he's a father of lies and when he speaketh he speaketh the LIE it's he speaks in a way to where there's enough there that even as he spoke in Genesis 3 to where he says well God said that this would happen and God said that would happen he said well this is really what's going to happen and he says enough and I hope you recognize his pattern there in Genesis 3 he says enough to where you can say oh well who's speaking which one is it how was he lying when he said that you'd become like Gods because then God says that's exactly what happened he realized he has a way of even using things that are true in such a way to cause you to be deceived in John chapter 18 these are just a lot of little pieces I'm putting out there uh and I'm hoping to start connecting things here in just a little bit John chapter 18 verses 33 to 38 looking at this to see what truth is not just something that is true but what truth is and remember Satan's this he's a murder he's of a murderous spirit and he abides not in truth and there is no truth in him but let's find where truth is and pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews may want to use this scripture for some time and we'll read something and we'll move on past it but we'll come back to it hopefully later art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him says Thou this of thyself or did others tell it thee of me why are you asking is this something you want to know for yourself or did somebody else put you up to it oh my is that not the devil's Mo you know go and ask him yeah go and ask this isn't an honest question that originates from within the heart of someone who's seeking truth but rather something else kind of moving remember Judas going why would we waste this we could feed the poor for a year and he didn't ask because he loved the poor he asked because he held the bag right and he wanted to get access to that he there's Bitcoin was going up he wanted to invest and he wanted access to the money and so he this the question that is asked he says well is this from you are you wanting to know if I'm the king of the Jews to satisfy the desire for truth in your heart or did others tell it the of me are you have you been told he claims to be the king just did someone else tell you that he's the king of the Jews where where's the question arising pilate answered am I a Jew thy no nation and the chief of priests have delivered thee unto me and what hast thou done and there's the recognize that Jesus is now being brought through to before the political power and being asked he's being questioned he says what have you done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight recognize the arena when he says my kingdom is not of this world and even how that may seem to be a contradiction when he began his whole first sermon began with repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and he's saying well my kingdom is not of this world if it was my servants would then fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence there's a lot that he says there it's a lot we said that what he just said is truth and you can take things away from it that are true yet you could spin it in a way that you get further from the truth by using the very things that he said people have done that with go and baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost they've taken things that are true and got further from the word used it as a step stool to step right out of scripture because they hold to the letter of it and resist the truth of it Jesus says my kingdom is not of this world it's it's not in this Arena it's not at this time it's not for these things if this is where my kingdom was being projected right now if my kingdom was about drawing swords and keeping me from being crucified trust me you wouldn't have a chance he's even said the only reason why you're able to deliver me up for crucifixion is you've received this power from my father you have no power except to be given to you of my father pilate therefore and therefore said unto him are thou a kingdom Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness of the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice this zeros it in on understanding what the truth is and the faith is it says everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice and he should bear witness of the truth there's a lot of things that are true that collectively are part of the truth broken down into their little individual Concepts people can just cherry pick and have a lot of true things in their bag and their Theology and their Doctrine and their belief and you begin to look at oh what's this scripture what's this it's that and you see a lot of things in it but he's saying no this isn't just things that are true he says I am the truth pilate saith in him what is truth there's the question what is truth and it immediately turns around and we had said this he went out again unto the Jews and saith unto them I find in him no fault at all he answered his question Jesus says that I come to Bear witness of the truth and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice the question is what is truth and pilate immediately answers it and says in him there is no fault there is no air though there may seem to be some contradiction and though it may seem to be against the law in this way and though it may not may not be in the way that we might have expected it in him there is no fault and that's what makes him truth there's no fault in the truth we know there's only one who is the truth and that is Jesus Christ he said I am the way the truth and the life Paul writing said let God be true but every man a liar that's remarkable this is why you bring things back to the word Paul even himself is saying let God be true but every man a liar in other words if you can't take what a man says back to the word then there's this well what is it because he says let God be true but every man a liar and if you look at it how Jesus was being accused and Jesus is being attacked he was accused of breaking the law healing on the Sabbath day in violation of the law accused of threatening to tear down the temple accused a blasphemy and all the different things that he was accused of and if you looked at the law in their interpretation of the law he would be guilty of breaking the law according to the man but he only violated their carnal interpretation of the law as Jesus said in Matthew 23 23 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you paid tithes of mint and Anderson cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone these things are true but you've missed the truth of it you've done these things of pain tithe and careful about this and strict about that but yet when it came down to it you've missed the way to your matters the deeper substance what's holding it all up at the end of the day of judgment mercy and Faith you shouldn't do these things but yet you've left the other undone therefore what they were doing was bringing them further away from God because the truth was deeper we could say it this way the devil's lie masquerades as the truth of God and as it dances around and masquerades as the truth of God is doing so by impersonation wants to cause confusion and it wants to impersonate you remember how that Satan was able to show Christ all the kingdoms of the world not just then existing but kingdoms of past and future so he had some conception of what had been he understood things as they presently were to a certain degree and could even project out the way that things would become are you listening Satan could Envision future kingdoms he could show Christ in a moment of time this is how things are going to look but the man said he knew the will of God and not maybe in a perfect sense but he has some figure he has something as Paul said we looked through a glass dark lid we see something there we see some image we can't make it all out in particular so Satan had seen enough in heaven seen enough unfolding at Earth to where he thought he knew what God was doing and so he could very quickly like a sketch artist try to begin to draw the picture of what he thought God was going to do so Satan is with the with the opportunity that he had as God gives him the time to do it he now wants to build a kingdom that looks like the kingdom that he thinks God's producing he was he had some concept of the plan of God and he could project out what he was building so he could so Jesus the kingdoms of the world and Jesus could acknowledge us this is what you're going to produce but Jesus knew there was another way that he would deal with those kingdoms or come into air of him as I said before I think I said it this way that Satan can use things that are true to describe things that are false use things use true things to describe a false thing to make the truth look wrong I'm just throwing some stuff out there for you guys to talk about at breakfast tomorrow these are these are things to consider Satan can use true things whether you want to say factual or scriptural or quotes and use different things and kind of put them up there and use them to describe something that's not truth and by doing so it makes the true look false it becomes a stain on what is truth because things that are true are going to comprise and the truth has truth the true things are part of the truth and these different things that make up Christ and make who he is when someone separates it out from Christ and misuses the name of Jesus Christ and misuses the message and misuses quotes and misuses all these things then there's this stain that's put on it so it's like well this collection of things that were presented to truth if put into a false image and what happens is The False Image now embodies what people say that's what they claim to be the truth and it's a straw man it's a lie have you heard the story about a lie with the truth clothes on I think if you heard brother John LaFontaine preach enough times you may have heard it first time I ever heard it was just a young boy and he told the story he told it in a way that was somehow truth and Eli were hanging out and the LIE convinced truth to go swimming and Truth took they took their clothes off and when truth jumped in the the lake the LIE put on the truth's clothes and so the lie went into town with true's clothes on and there's a there's some paintings that Express the image I don't look at them but there's this idea in philosophy and these ideas of with Plato and Democritus and different wines that say well what is truth it's in the abyss it's in the well it's been cast down in Noel so there's this depiction of Truth coming and rising up to the surface but since a lie has been walking around with the truth's clothes on people are afraid of the naked truth and that was I believe how brother John LaFontaine expressed it many decades ago that that the LIE dressed in the clothes of Truth and so it was using what was true to confuse what is truth just causing confusion masquerading is the truth and wearing the truth clothes and here's A well-dressed fully furnished lie but it's wearing the clothes that the truth wore and now people are more willing to accept a lie that's dressed up than they are the naked truth okay I hope you're with me to this point maybe said enough about the devil's lie and how he's using truth confusing the record we use elements of Truth to paint a picture that's false and it's painted in such a way to where it may contain enough elements of the Right image that we could just as easily reject the Right image based upon the false am I comparing them would say wow the Bible says this about righteousness and the devil says yeah it does say that about righteousness and it does say this about righteousness it says this about this and this about this begins to paint this picture over here and after a while you think oh well that's the picture that's being painted using all those truisms and you reject it because of the false and then the true you're unable to recognize it because you couldn't discern the LIE let's go through this quickly I want to just I don't want to get into the context of these scriptures or even the truth I don't even want to begin to express the truth of them I just want to say they're true and just look at the letter of it in Psalm 75 verse 8. we're kind of stepping forward all those little bits and pieces there are tools I hope that you can use to piece together what we're what we're going to be ending on Psalm 75 verse 8 for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and you poureth out the same but the dreads thereof all the wicked of the Earth shall ring them out and drink them okay there's a lot there but the Lord is depicted as having a cup full of red wine here he is holding this cup that's the Lord then in Revelation 17 the Harlot of mystery Babylon has a golden cup in her hand with the wine of her fornication and all the kings of the Earth are drunk on the wine that's in the cup so this mystery Babylon is holding a cup full of wine and now we see a very image of God who himself is holding a cup of wine Revelations 18 verse 16 saying alas it's about Babylon the great Harlot mystery Babylon alas alas that great City that was clothed in fine linen and purple I had a lot of had some scriptures to show it I think it's in John 19 that Christ is robed and purple it's a sign of royalty clothed and fine linen and purple and Scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls and this is being spoken of the great this is Mystery Babylon yet she is arrayed in a clothing fine linen and purple Scarlet decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls that's an image get in Revelations 19 verse 8 and to her speaking of the Bride the Lamb's wife to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints recognize how that certain elements are true of mystery Babylon and true of the Bride that are completely different things and if one was just looking for fine linen and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls they might look and see that and say oh the New Jerusalem in Revelations 21 is garnished with precious stones with Gates of pearls and streets of gold as the scripture describes it Revelation 17 and Revelations 18 it's kind of letting us see what it really is but how could it present itself if it seems to have all the same elements Revelation 6 verse 2 and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer here a white horse one sitting on him has a bow He Goes Forth conquering and to conquer he was given a crown in Revelations 12 the red dragon has seven crowns in Revelations 13 a beast with ten crowns so these crowns upon the head of the white horse in Revelation 6 2 upon the red dragon in Revelations 12 and upon the Beast with ten horns in Revelations 13 but then in Revelations 19 11 12 and 13 and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse there's one that comes right in on a white horse conquering out and biting and conquering and he that set upon him in this one now another white horse in Revelations 19 and listen a lot of theologians say there is Christ in Revelation 6. here he is a good Revelations 19. Behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God this is just a snippet the scriptures that we could begin to line up that describe one thing and then we can use them to begin to describe another there's elements that we can begin to describe about Babylonian religion and then you might find yourself finding out that oh those same elements exist within True Religion you might take things that you lift up as being well this is what this is but then you find out will it exist over here and if I'm making you uncomfortable at all in making you feel as if there's no Paradigm on earth that is of a human creation or some system that a man uses that can conclusively prove the truth then I've got you where you need to be because God wants you to know him by faith and not through some system that placates Your Lust for knowledge and satisfies all your Curiosities or just wets your appetite for Mysteries something that's real I was thinking today that Phoenix has gotten so hot that cognitive dissonance doesn't even work anymore and that's how we ought to come to truth these are different elements that on one hand describe things that are related to the Antichrist the mystery Babylon things that are wicked things that are impure and yet we could outline one standing with the cup in their hand and you say oh that's mystery Babylon but it's the Lord pouring out judgments oh there's one who's described with having pearls and gold and and fine linen and say oh that's mystery Babylon but yet it's the Bride of Jesus Christ I I know there's a the way I'm putting it maybe leaves a lot to be desired but I'm just wanting to stimulate some thought and how that things are presented one could take certain elements of scripture piece them together to paint a picture and say oh well this looks good and that looks good and this looks good and that looks good then if someone else could kind of piece things together here all this looks good that looks good but you know what takes the light of God's word to expose the contradiction between the devil's lie and the truth of God it takes the light of God's word and it's not just light that is shining globally and ecclesiastically in a light that's showing within the church and and as soon as we walk in we're like oh look this is this is happening no it's the light that's got to shine into your heart it's a light that has to shine for you into the word of God on one hand we have mystery Babylon on the other hand we have the New Jerusalem on one hand we have the Antichrist on the other hand we have Christ and yet they can the false Christ and false Apostles in this one of second Thessalonians 2 presents himself in such a way to where people think they're worshiping God but they're actually worshiping Satan we start thinking oh no well then how am I going to get it right but notice in Revelation 17 verse 1 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters and the word begins to describe that this woman who appears to be so beautiful and though she may have scarlet and be decked with Golds and pearls and dressed in fine linen this is a false representation this is Satan's bride this is something different and in the wrong kind of light you could think that's God's Mighty church and the wrong kind of light you could think the Antichrist is Christ in the wrong kind of life but yet there's a voice that comes it says it's a one of the Seven Angels which has the seven vials he says come I'll show the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters there's a lot we can begin to read in that but there's a voice that comes and exposes who that woman is then look in Revelations 21 verse 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels that had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying recognize the continuity there's a voice that exposes who mystery Babylon is to that who that woman is and he says come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife so the same one who exposes mystery Babylon is the same one that shows Revelations 21 and it has that symmetry because Revelation 17 directly opposes the image of Revelation 21. they both share these similar descriptions the the cemetery and the language and the things that are used in the image the outward appearance not what's Inward and the Judgment of it but you got to look at what was being portrayed and expressed without the judgment the same message that exposes the Harlot brings forth the bride the same message says look at mystery Babylon look at denominationalism look at the mark of the beast look at everything that's wrong look at The Heirs look at these things the same thing that exposes and gives the Judgment of the false systems introduces you to the true in other words it just doesn't sit back and tear everything down take pot shots everything is wrong there is no truth nobody's right but it brings you to truth and the voice that is exposing the air corrects the air it'll it'll take things and say well fine linen isn't for mystery Babylon it's for the bride pearls aren't to be used that way it's for the gates it's the streets of gold that's it and it's taking things and it places the devil doesn't have the Monopoly on the pearls didn't have a monopoly on the gold he doesn't have a monopoly on the fine linen he misuses it but there's a message that comes and takes things that have been misused and things that were true throughout the ages and all these things that were kind of loose ends and we're used to present wrong kind of images and support denominationalism and build kingdoms and God comes back and says I'm taking this back I'm taking that back and you've got to be careful that when God takes back the truth that you don't associate it to the ones who held it and bonded say oh well we don't want that because that was part of this oh we don't want that that was that was part of that Lord so you tell me you don't want justification anymore that's Luther's message we don't want it right surely we don't want justification we want it we want all truth we we want we want the truth is accumulated up we want these things that have advanced we want the Revelation what they had in measure we want in fullness what they hadn't over here with a little bit of understanding we want the full understanding of it truth of God it's the way the truth the life it exposes the LIE the devil's lie it exposes the counterfeit prophets who imitate the truth it exposes those who were using the language of scripture to present a picture and using this and using that and painted it and God comes with the voice that says we'll take that we'll take that and we'll show you where it's in the truth and if it helps you to understand that maybe says no see that's all false representations this is the truth and brings you to the comparison as Jesus says and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free oh how important the truth is this is the these are the mechanics of light I was going to get into a lot of the things that brother Brown says about light whatsoever death make manifest as light as long as there's enough fog and mist and confusion and distractions an image can be projected to where you can't quite figure out what it is and you can just fill in the blanks yourself and think that's the church that's truth this is what the Bible says about this but you're interpreting it through the Mist but then the light comes and gives the full picture and so the devil hates light and as the Devils lie pretends to be the truth it likes to masquerade as the truth it's very quick to call the truth a lie very quick to tear down the correct image and oppose it because it needs to save face as the truth with the naked truth shows I was like no no these are my clothes the truth says no he took it from me stole it from me those are mine oh no no no buddy this is me I I'm the truth he got there first life seems to travel a lot faster than the truth we used to joke around a little bit and certain times that if we ever wanted to get the news out we knew just the right people to share it with because you know everybody would find out because there's just some way those things travel I recognize how this works in Luke Chapter 23. this is a very important kind of COG that I just want to touch on very quick and then close in Luke chapter 23 verses 8 to 12. let's recognize that Pilate of the affiliation of Roman power political power and Herod who would be the the rightful ruler in a religious sense to the Jews and how that even in the image of the pergamian mixture and the thoroughly married that there is how the religious Kingdom of that day and the political Kingdom of that day Mary and unite themselves in what it takes to bring them together and when Herod saw Jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he'd heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him people can be excited to see but not for the same reasons that we are it says in verse 9 then he questioned him with many words but he answered him nothing and the chief priests and scribes are not satisfied with the what they get out of him he won't clown for him he's not giving them the information they need and tickling their ears and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him and Herod with his Men of War set him at naught and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and set sent him again to Pilate here's the truth here's the one that pilate's going to exclaim I find no fault in him that this is truth and this is one who's falsely accused and now herod's belittling him and mocking him and to raise him in a certain way and this mocking tone and the rearrangement of things and oh you're a king well let's just put this scripture on your head and let's just put a robe around you and you claim to be this and put all these things together and mocking him and setting him at not and when he sends them again to pilate notice how the Bible says the same day pilate and Herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves notice how quickly people who are Rivals will marry when they have a common hatred for truth that day political and religious could Unite not around truth but against truth under the pretense of Truth and things that were true and this is happening and that's happening and they were bitter enemies before and there was hatred but through the mockery of Truth through the opposition of Christ and being against and mocking and belittling as it said the enemy of my enemy is my friend now pilate and Herod had a reason to get together hang out in Fellowship because they found something they hated in common and that's how the devil's lies work they were uniting in gathering Darkness gathers against light John chapter 3 verse 19 it says and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil when lightness when light comes it exposes the LIE whatever makes manifest is light when you turn on the light the darkness scurries it goes and hides in a corner it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that brings forth truth it was the manifestation of Jesus Christ and that day that United pilate inherit it was the manifestation of the truth that caused the uh the high priest to lose his religion and rent his garments and all the the hatred and the Animus that was being expressed against Christ it was because the word was being revealed the Bible's saying that men hate the word not because they love the truth but because their deeds are evil they hate it because it's their their evil Deeds are exposed by the Light the Bible says in John 1 4 and 5 in him was life and the life was the light of men in light shineth and darkness in the darkness comprehended it not the darkness could not receive the light it's not in it to receive it cannot understand it can't learn it or perceive light it's can't grasp it it can't overcome it it can't oppose it it's the darkness gathers against light the darkness only exists in the absence of light Darkness realizes that it only it only has any meaning and only has any existence because of light so it hates light because the light is greater than it that's why the lie hates truth because the LIE doesn't exist on its own it's only a deformity it's only a perversion as soon as truth steps forward and declares itself the lie just Withers away it loses all power the Bible says in Matthew 4 16 and 17 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and Shadow death light is sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand it was the Kingdom of Light the Fulfillment of scripture that the people which Saturn great in darkness light was springing up those who are in bondage to lie is in darkness the shadow of death they are hanging over him light had sprung up and Christ comes preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Paul says in second Corinthians 4 just read three to four it says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believed not now we could come back and look at how that those that believe not receive not a love of the truth that they might be saved but you are chosen from the beginning to Salvation through the belief of the truth so if there's anyone that's blinded and I love this Paul is basically saying oh if anybody doesn't believe my message it's because they're lost I mean that's what Paul is saying so if you don't like that attitude we just don't like Paul he says if our gospel is hid if people don't believe it and they can't receive it it's just those that are lost that can't receive it he says in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believed not he blinds their minds and soul that the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God will not shine to them the reason why their minds are blinded is speak and the reason why they do not believe and the reason why they do not receive the Gospel is because the Light of Christ and the light does not get to them it has not shined on them so the devil's lie is Darkness it's death it's perversion it's filth it's unrighteousness but yet Satan himself and his Messengers are transformed as angels of life but yet they're messengers of death masquerading is like masquerading is truth because they hate the truth now I've said a lot to say this in closing the word exposes the devil's lie a lie can be 99 the things that are true contains things that are true up to 99 we're just using that formula it's not strict but the word exposes the devil's lie by bringing out the truth the devil may say oh you know you baptize the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and we could say well that's true but the truth of it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I say well this is this is what happens and this is what happens again this is what happens this is what the Bible says this is what the Bible says well that's true but this is the truth you always got to bring it back to scripture the light of God's word the word the message of the hour exposes the devil's lie many times not by not in the way that we say a complete oh well there's no such thing as baptism which is what some people do go into all the world and baptize them in the name of the father son of Holy Ghost well that was just an old foggy idea that died out with the apostles but it brings out the deeper truth of it the word removes the word overthrows the LIE and it takes as the LIE is cast down it places what is true even if it had come before it places it I I you know this will make more sense maybe as we continue uh in in future services but there's this we can get uncomfortable sometimes when when things are set a certain way and I'm not going to say it I'm going to say it uncomfortably but there there's there's a there's a need sometimes to tear down what's false and when your kingdoms are destroyed and your Idols have been destroyed now listen to me when the word starts tearing down the idols in your heart it wants to build back a true image and there may be things he's building back that remind you of what's been torn down but those things made a lie God's wanting to build truth God and building his image in you is using truth to build righteousness instead of the devil misusing things that are true to build unrighteousness and the word of God will come and whether it be from theologians or reformers the word of God will come and bring the true and place it where it belongs where it was probed at and missed and placed in the wrong place and not figured out and made a really bad picture and you had your cow in the tree uh chewing cut up in the tree and picking grass in a tree and it's all messed up then the word of God comes and it may take a cow and puts it in the grass and he said oh well the cow was eating grass in that picture not this is now truth because the truth is being placed the LIE can look 99 true so are you ready if a lie can look 99 true then sometimes it's not hard for the devil to convince you that the truth is 100 alive huh is that too long for a bumper sticker if a lie can be 99 truth he said well that's a lie then it's not hard for the devil to say well that was a lie and it was 99 true so how hard would it be for something to be 100 alive because we maybe we can't do a DNA test and figure it all out scientifically it's just well that's a line why was it a lie well that was a lie he said well that was a lie what made it lie the devil pretending to be the truth then we're talking about the the devil's tactics the devil being to project into the future the devil sowing seeds himself the devil in Genesis chapter four didn't sit back and be like I did it I did it I got a cane I got a murder I didn't oh he's projecting out he's playing he's calculating he'd already caused a rebellion in heaven he got away with that he thinks he can get away with building his own kingdom on Earth and so he had he even himself he walketh about making due use of every opportunity so he's very calculating very deliberate doing certain things in such a way and as he can calculate out he has a plan of setting things in order and as he puts these things together he's trying to present himself as truth and so that whenever the light comes he while pretending to be the truth accuses the word of being a lie I don't know why that deserved a sip but that's what the devil does while pretending be the truth now that the word comes and exposes him while wearing truth clothes he says well that's a lie clearly this is a lie and I can tell you why it's a lie and I can show you why it's a lie and then use true things to try to convince you that the word is alive not trying to make you uncomfortable it'll actually accuse the word wow I pretend to be the truth accuse the word of repeating a lie that he started oh when God told you that you'd become his gods he's just repeating what the serpent said I mean he's just he's just repeating a lie when in reality the word is pointed out just how subtly the terror is the contradiction to the wheat meanwhile the Tara said no no no no I got this I got that I got this I got that the wheat's actually the LIE no this is the truth this is the truth no the weeks at Weeks actually the LIE and then people will believe the devil's lie because they just didn't get a revelation of the truth this is why Satan hates revelation because it upsets all his plans he hates Revelation he would love he would love to and I think I read the statement before how that the worst of all things is science that masquerades his faith that when you get behind it's like oh this is just all calculations and this is just all data and figures and this is just somebody who did a word search and just vomited it out there's no real truth behind this there's no real inspiration this is just this is just facts and figures this is just data this is just history this is this is just academic and that's the worst kind of science there is is the kind that masquerades as faith kind of masquerades as truth and masquerades as believing and people believe the lie because they haven't caught a revelation the truth and the Revelation is what exposes where the leaven is exposes where the air is the devil's been painting a picture well isn't this beautiful and we're going well I mean I see in the Bible there's a cup in the hand and I see there's fine linen and I see it does this and I see it does that and I see that there'll be signs and wonders and I see that it has this and I see that it has that and it's like well then maybe this is it and then the light comes on and shows you the truth shows you what the real is and the one you've been looking at the whole time is saying no no hold on hold on wait a minute see I was here first I was here first I am the original that's the copy you realize why we need Revelation more than anything we need a true revelation of the truth of God which is the spirit of God and a true revelation of the devil's lie which is the Antichrist Spirit we need that true revelation because with that if we can buy the truth discern and withstand the devil's lie Satan is powerless before us with true Revelation in our lives we can recognize the truth of God and the devil's lie and if by that truth we can discern and withstand the devil's lie he has no power the devil only has power through Darkness he only has power through a lie so if we can buy Revelation Discerning with uh discern the two Spirits or recognize the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand that Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before us and this is why the devil hates the truth of God this is why the devil imitates it to steal it away from the elect and I know that's a lot and a lot for you to think about but I've shared with you tonight this contest between the devil's lie and the truth of God and if you looked at it in the way that I styled it it looks like a court case because I used the V period instead of vs period which is more Sports versus what's law but it's a trial and one claims to be the truth and the other is the truth and the only way you'll be able to judge is by the spirit of God and the only way you'll be able to know is by the Holy Ghost and so what we want more than anything is revelation not an explanation I would even go so far to say is I we do not want to merely look for what we call demonstration apart from revelation because education creates impersonation right and you're getting all lost in your Asians if you don't have a revelation to provide the demonstration we need some instrumentation but Mike if you could come musicians please come the devil's lie against the truth of God remember this going forward no that the devil just wants to cause confusion about truth and don't be afraid when things seem confusing I'm not going to try to make things confusing but as you look at things and read things and study things out in your heart and God begins to deal with you there will be a voice of the enemy that comes by and tries to whisper to you to try to cause fear and anxiety about the truth of God's word and in that moment don't be afraid trust the Lord trust the Lord to show you what is truth has recently sat down with a group of ministers and we're just sitting down fellowshipping and we were talking about something in particular and I was just honest with them I said there's nothing you Brothers teach that I'm afraid of I'm not afraid of it I said because what if in my heart if I if I have the spirit of God he's obligated to reveal to me truth and I'm not afraid of what what someone else teaches I'm not afraid of what they believe because the only thing that truth can do is amplify the truth I already know by revelation if there's something that I've carnally figured out in my head then let the word bring light upon it for me to have understanding I I want to grow deeper in love with Christ and he can only be known to the light of his word so I don't want to build the kingdom of my own understanding and my intellectual conception and try to hide and build a tower that's so high that can't be assailed and just stack quotes up so high that Revelation can't ever get to me oh I wanted to come and break away every idea and every Kingdom and every thought and when he begins to take away from me things that might have seemed very very comforting and I begin to get a little anxious trust him he knows what he's doing and just know that this word of God that has come to us that sheds light on these things that we can trust them that the true is coming into view and the devil's been working for six thousand years to fight against this truth so that when it comes he's got 6 000 years of data to throw at you to try to confuse you but the truth will prevail [Music] he's just an imitator impersonating the word to steal it from you don't let them do it stand with me tonight
