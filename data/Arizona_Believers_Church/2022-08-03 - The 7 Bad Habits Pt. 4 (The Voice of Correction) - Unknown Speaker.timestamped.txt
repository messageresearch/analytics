[0:00] Numbers Chapter 20 we're going to start
[0:02] with verse 7 it's going to sound a
[0:04] little unique once we begin to begin
[0:07] our um service and and get into our
[0:10] subject matter but this will just give
[0:12] you you could keep holding on knowing
[0:14] that hopefully I can come back to my
[0:16] text before it's over and it's going to
[0:17] seem very unique once you see our our
[0:20] subject matter Numbers chapter 20:7 and
[0:22] the Lord spake unto Moses saying take
[0:24] the rod and gather thou the assembly
[0:26] together thou and Aaron thy brother and
[0:29] speak ye unto the rock before their eyes
[0:33] and it shall give forth his water and
[0:35] thou shalt bring forth to them water out
[0:37] of the rock so Thou shalt give the
[0:39] congregation and their Beast drink and
[0:42] Moses took the rod from before the Lord
[0:44] as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron
[0:46] gathered the congregation together
[0:47] before the Rock and he said unto them
[0:49] hear ye now ye Rebels must we fetch you
[0:52] water out of this rock and Moses lifted
[0:55] up his hand and with his Rod he smot The
[0:57] Rock twice and the water came out
[0:59] abundantly and the congregation drank
[1:01] and their Beast also and the Lord spake
[1:03] unto Moses and Aaron because you
[1:05] believed me not to sanctify me in the
[1:07] eyes of the children of Israel therefore
[1:09] ye shall not bring this congregation
[1:11] into the land which I have given
[1:13] them this is the water of meah because
[1:16] the children of Israel strove with the
[1:17] Lord and he was Sanctified in them amen
[1:21] you can be
[1:23] seated I'm really excited about this
[1:25] subject we're going to do another
[1:27] segment uh another part in the segment
[1:29] of of the kids eat free and so all the
[1:32] kids here tonight you are able to eat
[1:34] free no charge uh kids eat free tonight
[1:37] and we're continuing on in that um
[1:40] segment of kids eat free we kind of
[1:42] started a series on the seven bad habits
[1:46] and this is a seven bad habits of highly
[1:48] ineffective parents I'm imagine some of
[1:50] the kids have probably been reminding
[1:52] the parents of this but we had it's been
[1:55] a few services on it so this is the
[1:56] fourth part I don't think that there's
[1:58] going to be anything lost in not having
[2:01] uh maybe a background in those other
[2:02] three parts so I trust that you can just
[2:04] really enter in with us on this subject
[2:06] and tonight we're going to be focusing
[2:08] on um a title of the voice of Correction
[2:11] so in these uh seven bad habits of
[2:13] highly ineffective parents um we've
[2:16] mentioned before that it this doesn't
[2:17] this doesn't just apply to parents but
[2:20] it would apply uh to all of us and it
[2:23] would be something that we could use at
[2:24] any station of life in any relationship
[2:27] that we might have and I don't know are
[2:29] we able to get that up and running is it
[2:31] something I
[2:33] did okay well well then we're just going
[2:36] to trust that this is just the way that
[2:37] it's supposed to be uh it was
[2:39] overemphasizing carnal things was number
[2:41] one and then inconsistently instructing
[2:44] and correcting number two improperly
[2:46] judging number three number four
[2:48] inappropriately using Voice number five
[2:51] was wrongly disciplining number six was
[2:53] not being an example and then number
[2:55] seven was withholding Grace and we
[2:56] matched those up with the elements of
[2:58] the stature of a perfect man and the
[3:03] last service we preached was on emphasis
[3:05] by example and we combined number one
[3:07] and number six on overemphasizing carnal
[3:10] things and not being an example and we
[3:11] took those two because they relate to uh
[3:14] how we act before people and how we act
[3:17] before our children and what we
[3:18] demonstrate the life that we live and
[3:20] the things that we promote by what we
[3:22] say what we View and what we do so we
[3:24] kind of use the emphasis emphasizing the
[3:26] right things by example and then the
[3:29] remaining ones the inconsistent
[3:31] instruction or correction improperly
[3:33] judging inappropriately using Voice or
[3:36] wrongly disciplining and even
[3:38] withholding Grace kind of all relate to
[3:40] how we directly treat our children and
[3:43] so there's ways that we could lump these
[3:45] together but tonight I want to take uh
[3:48] the inappropriately using voice and the
[3:50] wrongly uh disciplining and kind of lump
[3:53] those two together and we I'm going to
[3:56] use two statements from the statue of a
[3:57] perfect man just to kind of recap
[3:59] captured this there you go kids eat free
[4:02] uh so you could kind of see this um in
[4:05] the message of the hour because when we
[4:07] talked about uh using voice incorrectly
[4:09] I think we said it's contrasted by
[4:11] Temperance and we talk talked about just
[4:13] briefly about how the words and the tone
[4:15] that we use can be unfruitful maybe
[4:17] trying to accomplish something but just
[4:18] the way that you do it uh kind of
[4:20] unwinds it and brother bradam says in
[4:22] Statue of a perfect man this is Bible
[4:24] Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's
[4:26] just one of the lust of the flesh but
[4:28] we're talking about he's talking about
[4:29] drinking is just one of the lust of the
[4:31] flesh but we're talking about Holy
[4:33] Spirit Temperance that means how to
[4:35] control your tongue not be a Tattler how
[4:38] to control your temper not fly off every
[4:40] time anyone speaks cross to you so I
[4:43] want you to recognize that it's um
[4:45] action and reaction to every action
[4:47] there's an equal and opposite reaction
[4:49] so there's some something that provokes
[4:51] a response and he's looking at
[4:53] Temperance as being what tempers your
[4:56] response and controls it so it's
[4:57] controlling the tongue and then he
[4:59] continues oh Temperance how to answer in
[5:03] kindness when wrath is spoken to you so
[5:06] wrath kind of comes at you Temperance is
[5:08] to not return wrath um back to wrath
[5:11] somebody say you bunch of Holy Rollers
[5:13] down there don't jump out and roll up
[5:14] your sleeves now now that he says not
[5:17] that but talk with Godly love Temperance
[5:19] kindness is that the way you want to be
[5:22] when you're riled upon R not back let
[5:24] him be your example so that's how uh
[5:28] using he's talking about controling the
[5:29] tongue that would be using your voice to
[5:31] respond in Wrath to kind of roll up your
[5:33] sleeves and get right back in their
[5:34] faith face if they have something
[5:36] negative to say you have something
[5:38] negative back that's what um Temperance
[5:40] is is to use him as your example and you
[5:43] kind of bridle that tongue now in
[5:45] wrongly disciplining we contrasted that
[5:48] by patience and I think we Ed the point
[5:51] that wrongly incorrec doesn't correct so
[5:54] if you correct incorrectly you're not
[5:55] going to be correcting the person you're
[5:57] trying to correct and if you correct out
[5:59] a Pride or frustration it kind of breeds
[6:01] the same I think those are some of the
[6:02] things that we mentioned um before and
[6:05] this is what brother bradam says we
[6:06] contrasted this with patience he says
[6:08] and we should have patience with one
[6:10] another too we get so much impatient
[6:13] with one anothers and so you have to
[6:15] have this uh ability just kind of uh
[6:18] persevere and to wait on things and not
[6:20] always be so uh knee-jerk and reactive
[6:23] and then he's uses Moses as an example
[6:26] and we kind of read this in Numbers
[6:27] Chapter 20 and so this fits in
[6:30] beautifully and kind of draws our
[6:32] attention to this and I want it to kind
[6:33] of remain in the back of our minds as we
[6:35] go forward he says even one time when
[6:38] that Rebellion bunch of people had such
[6:40] impatience so they were impatient why
[6:42] are we out here we're all going to die
[6:43] you've led us into the Wilderness he
[6:44] says they caused Moses to do something
[6:47] was wrong so they impatience bred and
[6:50] impatience with him and he did something
[6:52] wrong but yet when it come to Showdown
[6:54] God got sick of their action he said
[6:56] separate yourself Moses I'll kill the
[6:58] whole bunch of them and start knew he
[7:00] threw himself in the breach and said God
[7:02] don't do it so this is a beautiful
[7:05] example of how just because you've done
[7:07] something wrong doesn't mean you can't
[7:08] get something right Moses uh in one
[7:11] instance does something that offends God
[7:13] that inspires his wrath against Moses
[7:16] but here God's wanting to judge in his
[7:19] wrath and in his anger he's wanting to
[7:20] judge Israel and it's Moses that says
[7:23] hold on wait a minute let's not be so
[7:26] harsh or severe and brother Bram says
[7:28] patience with the people that were
[7:30] rebelling against him we know Moses is
[7:33] kind of his characterized of his
[7:35] meekness and whatever characteristic
[7:37] this was with Moses in this particular
[7:39] instance it caused him to want to
[7:41] restrain severe punishment uh for the
[7:44] children of Israel and he says patience
[7:47] with the people that were rebelling
[7:49] against him now I I think you've
[7:51] probably already made the connection
[7:53] when we ask our children to do something
[7:54] they don't do it our children are
[7:56] rebelling against our Command against
[7:58] our word and what we need is we need to
[8:00] have the right kind of patience so that
[8:02] we can discipline correctly and this
[8:04] fits right in this wrongly disciplined
[8:06] disciplining in the wrong way fits right
[8:08] in with having patience to meet out the
[8:11] right kind of punishment when it's
[8:13] necessary so my subtitle tonight is the
[8:16] voice of Correction I trust you're all
[8:18] kind of staying with me tonight um and
[8:22] and comfortable and and attentive to
[8:24] this because I'm really really excited
[8:26] about I think there's just some
[8:27] tremendous things in here and and I want
[8:29] to get through um the scriptures that I
[8:31] have with me tonight and so I I won't be
[8:34] able to maybe go as deep as I'd like to
[8:36] on some of them but I am will not have a
[8:39] problem revisiting it and just reading
[8:41] the same scriptures and just go on
[8:42] another level with it um if you have a
[8:45] problem with it I don't mind you sharing
[8:46] with with me at all uh but if we cover
[8:49] this tonight and it doesn't seem to get
[8:51] very deep I believe God can just Inspire
[8:52] us to come right back to it and
[8:54] emphasize some of these things in a
[8:55] greater way but on this subject the
[8:58] voice of corre direction we're combining
[9:01] this uh the right using the right voice
[9:03] instead of inappropriately using voice
[9:05] we want to use the right voice and the
[9:07] correct correction and there's some
[9:09] overlap this is well I put this way
[9:12] there's an overlap then of this
[9:13] instruction and this correction and some
[9:16] of you have probably heard this
[9:17] principle before it's readily
[9:19] identifiable in the scripture that
[9:20] there's different types of discipline
[9:22] when we think of discipline we think
[9:24] punishment oh you need to be punished
[9:26] but in the scripture dis discipline uh
[9:28] is to is what you do with a disciple
[9:30] someone's being discipled and so it
[9:32] involves a lot of teaching and a lot of
[9:34] instruction so there's instructive uh
[9:37] discipline which is kind of proactive
[9:38] and it teaches one how to act and so you
[9:41] have that Concept in scripture we have
[9:43] that Concept in our relationships and
[9:44] with our children we're not just kind of
[9:46] sitting back waiting for them to make a
[9:48] mistake and saying now no that's not
[9:49] what you're supposed to do we need to
[9:50] take time to teach them the right way
[9:52] and then our uh there's another form of
[9:54] discipline which is corrective and
[9:57] that's kind of so you have one that's
[9:58] proactive and teaching them how to act
[10:00] then the corrective side is kind of
[10:02] responsively addressing something and
[10:05] addressing actions to permanently uh
[10:08] modify Behavior you know I just want to
[10:10] do it in that instance because there's a
[10:12] lot of ways that we can address bad
[10:13] behavior that just alleviates it for
[10:15] that moment but uh kind of the de
[10:18] deliberate intentional perseverant in uh
[10:21] corrective discipline is something
[10:23] that's want to permanently modify
[10:25] Behavior not just get them to stop now
[10:27] but impart some instruction along with
[10:29] it that they realize this is something I
[10:31] ought not to do because I know there's
[10:33] times we could all relate to this
[10:34] there's times when we can correct our
[10:36] children and the offense is kind of
[10:38] ambiguous on their part even though it's
[10:40] obvious to us and they don't quite
[10:42] understand it's not just the moment or
[10:44] it's not just the manner it's the whole
[10:46] thing that was wrong and you need to
[10:47] stop because you could just change
[10:49] context a little bit and they'll think
[10:50] the the behavior is fine unless you're
[10:52] doing it in a way to address permanent
[10:55] change I think it's the instructive
[10:58] discipline that's called formative
[11:00] discipline in some um some circles in
[11:02] some ways and that just means you it's
[11:04] done to form something to shape
[11:06] something to have a lasting influence
[11:09] and so that's we're looking at these two
[11:10] principles of Correction and instruction
[11:13] and I think there's a tremendous overlap
[11:14] with them now this is an important uh
[11:18] important concept to grab a hold of
[11:20] tonight because it's going to be this
[11:21] very image that I'm wanting to carry
[11:23] through on the voice of Correction a
[11:26] voice is your expression or your
[11:27] utterance and that may seem very obvious
[11:29] but to voice something is to give
[11:31] expression to it and it's the medium a
[11:34] voice is the medium or agency of
[11:37] expression so if you say the voice of
[11:39] the right or the voice of the left or
[11:41] the voice of this group or the voice of
[11:43] the family it's the one that's given
[11:45] expression to the needs the wants or the
[11:47] platform or the desires of a particular
[11:49] group so the voice of Correction it's
[11:52] the means of expressing the correction
[11:55] it's not just the utterance of your
[11:57] voice but it's the ageny of the
[12:00] instruction it's the agency of the
[12:02] correction and so it's important and
[12:04] what maybe we're looking at tonight is
[12:06] asking ourselves how how do we instruct
[12:09] how is it that we convey correction how
[12:11] is it we're conveying our uh the things
[12:13] that we're wanting to instruct our
[12:14] children how do we even to the extent of
[12:17] how do we express our
[12:18] approval maybe more importantly how do
[12:20] we express our disapproval is it usually
[12:23] through clinched teeth you knucklehead
[12:25] you're going to get a knuckle sandwich
[12:27] we really need to think about how it is
[12:28] that we're expressing these things
[12:31] because that's the voice of your
[12:33] instruction that's the voice of your
[12:34] correction so I think it's a real maybe
[12:36] if it's just me that se sees it you can
[12:38] just Pat me on the back later and say
[12:39] that was really nice brother eron but
[12:41] something very beautiful in the thought
[12:42] of him using this term voice it's the
[12:44] means of expressing something now let's
[12:48] start in one of our our children's
[12:49] favorite scripture in Proverbs chapter
[12:52] 22:15 and the children will just find
[12:54] that these are the ones that really get
[12:56] them going in the morning and find a
[12:58] tremend amount of inspiration from are
[13:01] these things but what I'm wanting to
[13:02] establish first in the scripture and I
[13:05] know that I could do more so even with
[13:07] statements in the message of the hour
[13:08] that amplify this to to tremendous
[13:10] degrees is that there is the instruction
[13:13] within the word of God that there's
[13:15] times when our children need to be
[13:18] physically
[13:20] chastised and I know there maybe some
[13:22] take a lot of Liberty with that but
[13:23] let's just recognize this in scripture
[13:26] foolishness is bound in the heart of of
[13:29] a child sin and Folly is in man
[13:31] Naturally by his birth to say that it's
[13:33] bound it means it's settled it's fixed
[13:35] it's rooted in his very nature so now
[13:37] being bound in his nature what does it
[13:39] want to do it wants to come to fruit
[13:41] wants to express itself so by birth it's
[13:42] in there shaping in iniquity and sended
[13:45] to my mother conceive me so it's there
[13:46] by birth foolishness is bound in the
[13:48] heart of a child but is how what's going
[13:50] to keep it from growing but the rod of
[13:52] Correction shall drive it far from him
[13:56] so correction is the means of reforming
[13:59] in the child's nature and I'll say this
[14:02] even without a birth the correct nurture
[14:05] of a parent can form the right kind of
[14:07] character in a child to have integrity
[14:09] to be honest to treat people decently
[14:12] and there's a way that we can treat our
[14:13] children and raise our children that's
[14:15] shaping them the right way so that when
[14:17] the time comes for them to change
[14:19] there's a lot less weeding of the garden
[14:21] that the Holy Spirit has to do for the
[14:23] heart to be changed by the Holy Ghost
[14:25] but correction is the means of driving
[14:28] this foolishness out of a child's heart
[14:30] so children need correction and all the
[14:33] children
[14:34] said thank
[14:36] you I can't I meant to write this down
[14:40] one of the one of the ancient
[14:42] commentaries said ignorance weakness
[14:44] inclination to evil Corruption of heart
[14:47] are maladies which accompany all men
[14:49] from their birth education instruction
[14:52] correction cure them or diminish very
[14:54] much their ill effects now this could
[14:57] just be observed in uh in the home life
[15:00] just observed in teaching children and
[15:03] disciplining them and then with the
[15:05] grace of God and with the aid of the
[15:06] Holy Spirit and with the word at our
[15:08] disposal instruction and correction I
[15:11] will diminish the ill effects of the sin
[15:13] that's bound up in their heart sin and
[15:15] Folly is bound in the heart of a child
[15:17] but the rod of Correction shall drive it
[15:19] far from him now I know that there's
[15:21] some revisionist the theologians that
[15:24] are trying to change what the rod means
[15:26] and there's a lot of different uh
[15:29] platforms out there or just way they try
[15:31] to describe well the rod is just a means
[15:32] of guiding and no doubt the rod of
[15:37] Correction is a means of guiding but
[15:40] what they want to use it is more just as
[15:41] a pointing stick right and they try to
[15:43] strip it of its real meaning but this is
[15:45] what the scripture says in Proverbs
[15:47] 23:13 to4 withhold not correction from
[15:51] the child for if thou beatest him with
[15:54] the rod he shall not die so you really
[15:56] it's really not a pointer and if it is
[15:59] it's telling you that it it's actually
[16:00] saying that uh don't worry about beating
[16:03] him because he's not going to die from
[16:05] it that's what it's saying withhold not
[16:08] correction from the child if thou
[16:10] beatest him with the rod it means to
[16:11] beatest and then in verse 14 it says
[16:13] beat it means to Smite to strike to
[16:16] receive a blow so it's speaking of
[16:17] chastisement punishment and it's
[16:19] implying some
[16:21] severity everybody relax I'm not not
[16:24] going to pull out some of these uh pull
[16:26] out a switch and demonstrate how you
[16:28] ought to to do it says withhold not
[16:30] correction from the child for thou
[16:31] beatest him with the rod he shall not
[16:33] die Thou shalt beat him with the rod and
[16:36] shalt deliver his soul from Death again
[16:38] this is showing that correction is
[16:40] necessary uh we have the St saying spare
[16:42] the rod spoil the child what's coming
[16:44] from these very scriptures because it's
[16:46] sparing uh the child of ruin it says if
[16:49] you beat him with the rod Thou shalt
[16:51] deliver his soul from hell so properly
[16:54] administered and that may be a phrase
[16:56] some people just completely forget but
[16:57] properly administered it will not kill
[17:00] him or bring him physical harm if you
[17:03] use the rod of Correction I know it's
[17:06] kind of harsh language but just it's the
[17:08] old English Kings James version it says
[17:10] if thou beat him with the rod if you
[17:12] strike him or Smite him physically in a
[17:15] corrective mean properly administered
[17:17] it's saying it's not going to kill him
[17:18] it's not going to bring him physical
[17:20] harm but it may actually save him from
[17:22] it we we I don't want to hurt him I
[17:25] don't want to harm him but actually it's
[17:26] saying that if you do it you'll actually
[17:28] save his soul from hell so it's through
[17:30] at least some on some level a severe
[17:32] punishment that trains the child to know
[17:34] that certain behaviors are detrimental
[17:36] not only to life physically but to their
[17:39] soul
[17:40] spiritually says in Proverbs 13:24 he
[17:43] that spareth his Rod hath his son so if
[17:45] you're not willing to spank as we might
[17:48] say or Smite or physically correct your
[17:50] child he that spareth his Rod hateth his
[17:53] son but he that loveth him chasteneth
[17:55] him be times that means early in the
[17:57] morning as much as need
[17:59] before the roots grow into
[18:01] habits he that spares the rod hates his
[18:04] son but he that's using it loves his son
[18:07] and and he's not languishing he's not
[18:09] waiting it's something he uses be times
[18:11] he's using it early he's using it as
[18:12] needed before this sin that's bound up
[18:15] in their heart can begin to express
[18:19] itself Proverbs chap 29:1 15 just give
[18:24] me a smile if you're okay and you're
[18:25] comfortable I know maybe some of the
[18:27] kids tonight are going to Gra knew it I
[18:29] knew it was coming to this I I warned my
[18:32] parents Proverbs 29:15 the rod and
[18:36] reproof give wisdom so the rod and
[18:39] reproof this correction this instruction
[18:42] gives wisdom but a Child Left to himself
[18:44] bringeth his mother to shame a child
[18:47] left without the rod a child left
[18:49] without Repro is going to disappoint his
[18:52] parents but worse it's going to bring
[18:53] them to shame because they're the ones
[18:55] that withhold the wisdom of the rod the
[18:58] wisd wi of the reproof in order to guide
[19:00] the child in the way that he should go
[19:02] and conduct himself in a way that's
[19:04] above reproach and by the reproof and by
[19:07] the rod of Correction and so I'm just
[19:09] kind of glancing over this very very
[19:11] quickly because I believe the word is
[19:13] clear that we must discipline our
[19:15] children and sometimes corporally that
[19:18] means to corporal punishment in a legal
[19:21] sense is to inflict P physical pain is
[19:24] punishment anybody here ever had
[19:26] corporal punishment in school
[19:29] brother Lucas anybody else we want to
[19:30] make sure this gets on
[19:32] tape I can still remember in elementary
[19:34] school having to go to some closet they
[19:37] want you to bend over and hold your
[19:38] ankles they pull out a paddle and they
[19:41] they whacked you and they spanked you in
[19:43] school and I know this seems like a
[19:44] strange concept for those who don't
[19:48] homeschool but it's in public schools
[19:50] they used to spank you I think they only
[19:51] do it now in homeschool but uh it's a
[19:55] real thing this corporal punishment uh
[19:57] and even to some degree you could say um
[20:00] um that that's what or I just I'm using
[20:02] that word corporal punishment but the
[20:04] Bible is saying that there must be some
[20:05] means of conveying to your children the
[20:07] severe severe consequences of their
[20:10] behavior not even so much in the moment
[20:12] but if that behavior continues what is
[20:14] it going to look like like an adult and
[20:16] so the Bible is advocating and saying
[20:19] that it is scriptural to use the rod of
[20:22] Correction and and if you're asking well
[20:25] brother Aaron you know how big does it
[20:26] need to be how heavy what's size bat
[20:29] should I be using or what what kind of
[20:31] leather belt should I be using I think
[20:33] that you ought to be ought to be very
[20:34] prayerful and mindful of just the type
[20:36] of damage that the instrument you use to
[20:38] spank your children can cause and the
[20:40] things I'm talking about tonight will
[20:42] hopefully curtail some of the knee-jerk
[20:44] uh punitive discipline we meet out
[20:47] sometimes with the rod in justified by
[20:49] scripture we need to be very thoughtful
[20:52] and careful about this because it's in
[20:53] the word but the word is not completely
[20:56] just leaving it up to us hey if you
[20:58] think it needs to bruise them if you
[20:59] think they need to bleed do what you
[21:01] need as a parent the Bible is not
[21:03] telling us uh no pain no gain to the
[21:06] inth degree but it's telling us that
[21:09] physically spanking your children is a
[21:11] principle in the word of God that can be
[21:14] used to benefit the
[21:16] child and if it you think I'm trying if
[21:18] it looks like I'm trying to be very
[21:19] balancing tonight I
[21:22] am now I'm going to give you a statement
[21:24] here in a moment and I'll ceue it up
[21:26] here in just a second but there's a
[21:28] scientific study and it was kind of an
[21:31] aggregation an analysis covering over 50
[21:33] years of scientific studies and uh which
[21:36] surveyed and included more than 160,000
[21:40] children and it came to this conclusion
[21:44] that if children are physically punished
[21:46] as a child I guess that kind of
[21:49] repetitive if you're physically punished
[21:50] as a child you're more likely to develop
[21:52] mental health problems and some of us
[21:55] are saying I knew there was a
[21:56] explanation for this but in the if a
[21:59] child is physically punished they're
[22:00] saying it's that actual treatment as a
[22:03] child that gives rise to mental health
[22:04] problems uh they've also used it to
[22:06] explain antisocial behaviors and all
[22:08] sorts of maladies and mental illnesses
[22:10] uh and they're kind of trying to connect
[22:12] it to uh the child receiving physical
[22:15] punishment as they were raised and this
[22:17] is the statement I wanted you to read it
[22:18] says we found that spanking was
[22:21] associated with unintended detrimental
[22:24] outcomes and was not associated with the
[22:27] more immediate or long long-term
[22:29] compliance which are parents intended
[22:31] outcomes when they discipline their
[22:33] children how kind right they're saying
[22:35] that they're at least giving the credit
[22:37] to the parent that when they discipline
[22:39] their children through spanking that the
[22:42] what they're intending to do is to bring
[22:44] both immediate and long-term compliance
[22:47] they're wanting to produce obedience
[22:49] within their children but they're saying
[22:51] we found this is what science has found
[22:54] and and if you can't tell the little
[22:55] icon we use a Bible for scriptures we
[22:57] use a picture of brother Brandon for
[22:58] quotes and I have Bill NY the science
[23:00] guy for all the scientists tonight and
[23:02] so if you've lost all confidence in this
[23:04] conclusion I don't uh I I understand but
[23:08] it says we found that spanking was
[23:10] associated with unintended detrimental
[23:13] outcomes so they actually showing us
[23:15] that CH parents who with the right kind
[23:17] of motive in their heart to produce
[23:19] immediate compliance or this is what
[23:21] they're trying to achieve is compliance
[23:23] uh immediate and long term that it's not
[23:25] producing what they wanted but it
[23:27] actually produced unintended detrimental
[23:30] outcomes and one of those being that
[23:32] later on in life there's mental health
[23:34] problems antisocial behaviors and they
[23:36] said children who were physically
[23:37] punished were more likely to endorse
[23:40] hitting as a means of resolving their
[23:42] conflicts with peers and
[23:44] siblings and you could take issue with
[23:46] the studies but I could produce I could
[23:48] spend the the rest of the year on
[23:50] Wednesday nights producing to you study
[23:52] after study after study that's trying to
[23:53] say physically spanking your children is
[23:56] wrong it's bad and you shouldn't do it
[23:58] any anybody heard these arguments before
[24:00] these studies are out there you're going
[24:01] to hear them on all sorts of Networks
[24:03] you're going to see them on the Internet
[24:04] you're going to read them everywhere
[24:05] they're saying that when you spank your
[24:07] children it produces unintended outcomes
[24:09] mental health problems and uh uh all
[24:11] sorts of mental illnesses and and rage
[24:13] and Temperance says that when children
[24:15] are physically punished they're more
[24:17] likely to use hidden as a means of
[24:19] resolving
[24:21] conflicts so there they're actually
[24:22] looking it within the context of
[24:24] children that if you use corporal
[24:26] punishment to correct or discipline your
[24:28] child that they will in turn use hitting
[24:32] and punching uh in their disagreements
[24:34] with their peers and their siblings so
[24:37] the the scientist would tell you that if
[24:39] your child your son or your daughter is
[24:41] kicking or punching or slapping or
[24:43] biting uh their siblings they might ask
[24:45] well do you physically spank your
[24:47] children to correct them and you say
[24:48] well yes I actually do that says well
[24:50] that could be the cause of this
[24:53] Behavior now I I've just kind of set
[24:56] that up and I haven't I haven't done it
[24:58] just to spike it down necessarily but
[25:00] let me say this the word is not
[25:03] wrong so what is
[25:06] wrong this is what I want you well I I'm
[25:09] getting some answers but I don't mean to
[25:12] disagree and turn this into a
[25:13] conversation science isn't
[25:15] wrong science goes based on things that
[25:17] are
[25:18] observable and can be repeated and over
[25:22] 50 years of studies and over 160,000
[25:24] children even I as a faith-based
[25:27] Believer think
[25:28] science probably isn't wrong and even
[25:31] our own experiences have taught us no I
[25:33] don't think it's wrong so what's wrong
[25:35] how can reality contradict God's
[25:39] principle because think of this I I want
[25:42] you to think very very deeply about this
[25:44] physical pain alone will not produce the
[25:46] results that are proposed by
[25:49] scripture don't SP spoil this child by
[25:52] sparing the rod spank your children beat
[25:54] him with the rod don't worry he won't
[25:57] die beat him with the rod Thou shalt
[25:59] beat him with the rod and deliver his
[26:00] soul from hell and we take that's a
[26:02] directive I need to beat my child but
[26:04] it's not just saying that Pain by itself
[26:06] is going to deliver the child's soul
[26:08] from hell so it's not it's not a failure
[26:11] of the word of God and it's not even a
[26:12] failure of science they're observing
[26:15] what misapplying the word of God has
[26:17] produced in generations of children it's
[26:20] a failure of adop of adopting the wisdom
[26:23] and the nature of the word and then
[26:25] misapplying the word principle you can't
[26:28] just just take something in the word of
[26:29] God and then take the nature and the
[26:31] principle of it that's behind it or the
[26:33] the the nature of it and try to apply it
[26:35] and achieve the right kind of results we
[26:37] could look at organized religion and
[26:39] science would tell us it's a joke and
[26:41] you know what we would say science is
[26:46] right Proverbs chap 15 veres 1 to5 it's
[26:50] a failure of adopting wisdom the wisdom
[26:52] of the word the nature of the word to
[26:55] misuse the the word Proverbs 15 verses 1
[26:59] to5 now I I'd like to spend more time on
[27:02] this but just kind of catch this a soft
[27:05] answer turneth away wrath but Grievious
[27:08] words stir up
[27:10] anger the tongue of the wise useth
[27:13] knowledge AR right but the mouth of
[27:15] fools porth out foolishness the eyes of
[27:18] the Lord are in every place beholding
[27:20] the evil and the good a wholesome tongue
[27:22] is a tree of life but perverseness
[27:25] therein is a breach in the spirit that's
[27:28] just how words can um Can inflict pain
[27:32] or can bring healing a wholesome tongue
[27:33] is a tree of life but perverseness
[27:35] therein is a breach in the spirit a fool
[27:37] and notice what it arrives at a fool
[27:39] despiseth his father's instruction but
[27:42] he that regardeth reproof is
[27:44] prudent all these different these
[27:46] scriptures one two 3 four they're all
[27:48] connected to instruction they're all
[27:50] related to correction and what I want
[27:52] you to recognize is that in instructing
[27:55] in reproof the voice is a crucial part
[27:59] if a wholesome and wise tongue is
[28:01] missing if a wholesome voice if a wise
[28:03] voice is missing then the correction is
[28:05] just merely
[28:07] pain soft answer turns away wrath
[28:09] Grievous words but Grievous words stir
[28:12] the anger it's like a point Counterpoint
[28:13] soft answer turns away with wrath but
[28:15] Grievous words will stir up anger a
[28:16] tongue of the wise usth knowledge
[28:18] correctly but the mouth of the Fool
[28:19] porth Out foolishness a wholesome tongue
[28:22] is a tree of life but a perverted tongue
[28:24] is a breach in the spirit so it says a
[28:26] fool despises his father's instru
[28:28] instruction but regardeth but he that
[28:29] regardeth Repro is prudent it's saying
[28:31] that we've got to be sure that our
[28:34] instruction our correction harmonizes
[28:36] with a soft answer a tongue of the wise
[28:38] a wholesome
[28:40] tongue so a wholesome and wise voice if
[28:44] it's missing then our correction
[28:47] physical correction is just merely
[28:49] pain worse yet if the wrong voice is
[28:52] used it compounds and deepens the
[28:56] pain so you have to have this soft
[28:59] answer the tongue of the wise the
[29:00] wholesome tongue it's what's going to it
[29:03] needs to be it's there as an aid in the
[29:05] correcting and so let's just say you
[29:07] withhold that then it's it's all you're
[29:10] doing is inflicting
[29:12] pain if you saw your child doing
[29:14] something wrong and you just went by and
[29:16] you know hit them and then kept going
[29:18] the only thing that registered is my
[29:21] parent just hit me and that hurt right
[29:24] so there all you've done is inflicted
[29:26] them with pain and so now just think of
[29:28] it this way if you add to that insult
[29:33] you add to that aggravating words and
[29:35] UNG Grievious words and perverseness in
[29:37] the tongue and foolish pouring out then
[29:41] it compounds and deepens that physical
[29:43] pain saying a soft answer turneth away
[29:46] wrath it's talking about the right
[29:47] response and in the Statue of a perfect
[29:49] man brother B is saying that Bible
[29:50] Temperance is how to answer
[29:53] back that's what Bible Temperance is it
[29:55] doesn't escalate uh this past week we
[29:58] did a devotion on Monday night just at
[30:00] the Children's request they suggested
[30:02] the topics Monday night was on
[30:03] antagonism and then the next night was
[30:05] on temper Temperance and they both are
[30:08] you know are work together how an
[30:10] antagonist is trying to escalate
[30:12] conflict it is trying to stir up strife
[30:15] and then Temperance is
[30:17] deescalation having the right
[30:20] answer and and think of it how the Bible
[30:23] is saying the soft answer turns away
[30:25] wrath but it's Grievous words that stir
[30:27] up anger and Colossians 3:21 and also in
[30:29] Ephesians says fathers provoke not your
[30:32] children to anger lest they be
[30:34] discouraged what's the agency of
[30:36] provoking anger in your child it may not
[30:39] be the physical punishment but it's the
[30:41] words that we use towards our children
[30:43] that frustrate and harbor within them
[30:45] here the anger and the Wrath because it
[30:48] says a soft answer turns wrath away in
[30:52] Proverbs 29:
[30:54] 17-22 he says correct thy son and he
[30:58] shall give thee rest and there's there's
[31:01] a whole lot going here so you just have
[31:02] to read it very closely with me and I
[31:04] just want to allude to the the kind of
[31:05] the subject as overall correct thy son
[31:07] and he shall give thee rest y he shall
[31:09] give Delight unto thy Soul so if you
[31:10] withhold correction the Bible says he's
[31:12] going to be a shame to you where there
[31:14] is no vision the people perish but he
[31:17] that keepeth the law happy is he that's
[31:18] a very uh familiar scripture to us so
[31:21] this is being proactive having a vision
[31:23] thinking long term in terms of how
[31:24] you're treating your child and what
[31:26] you're teaching what it's going to
[31:27] produce a a servant will not be
[31:28] corrected by words for though he
[31:32] understandeth he will not answer see us
[31:34] thou a man that is Hasty in his words
[31:37] there's no there is more hope of a fool
[31:39] than of him there's the temperance
[31:41] restraint not just answering back
[31:43] immediately holding your tongue he that
[31:46] delicately bringeth up his servant from
[31:48] a child shall have him become his son at
[31:51] length there's different interpretations
[31:54] of this that some I I've read some
[31:56] places where they say that if you are
[31:59] bringing up your child in the right way
[32:01] then you get him as a
[32:06] son that sounds nice and certainly maybe
[32:09] that's maybe a compound
[32:11] application but it's actually saying
[32:13] that if you don't treat them the right
[32:15] way they'll become
[32:17] insolent they'll get to the place to
[32:19] where they feel
[32:21] entitled and you'll never be able to get
[32:23] them to work for you it's interesting
[32:25] isn't it very interesting
[32:28] and so it says if you delicately bring
[32:30] up your servant he you'll have him as a
[32:33] son at length eventually he's going to
[32:34] feel he has a right to your table he has
[32:36] do this and do that do whatever he wants
[32:39] an angry man stirreth up strife and a
[32:41] furious man aboundeth in transgression
[32:45] now just look at how these things
[32:47] there's different ways of connecting
[32:48] these pieces together correct your son
[32:49] he give you rest see how a man that's
[32:51] just Hasty with words the servant will
[32:53] not be corrected by words only and if
[32:55] you delicately bring up your servant he
[32:57] becomes a son and angry man stirreth up
[32:58] Strife a furious man aboundeth in
[33:00] transgression so addressing a balance it
[33:03] related specifically to servants a
[33:05] firmness and a sternness and kind of the
[33:07] pampering and spoiling that you might do
[33:09] of a servant there has to be some
[33:11] balance you can't just be real harsh and
[33:13] stirring up anger and just spewing off
[33:15] and saying whatever you want but you
[33:17] also can't just be so tender and
[33:18] delicate to where it doesn't there
[33:21] there's no consciousness of consequence
[33:23] for their
[33:25] behavior excuse me and so if I could say
[33:28] this the Bible's saying we we must not
[33:30] be harsh but we can't be
[33:33] delicate we we must be Stern but not
[33:35] necessarily
[33:37] severe and so when we correct we must do
[33:39] it and we would do words as necessary to
[33:42] correct and use the rod as necessary to
[33:45] correct but never with
[33:46] anger this is what the Bible's telling
[33:48] us you must correct you must train you
[33:51] must discipline and you you're going to
[33:52] use words mostly and there's times
[33:54] you're going to have to use the rod but
[33:55] it should never be with anger
[33:57] ver 2911 a fool utth all his mind but a
[34:01] wise man keepeth it in till
[34:04] afterwards may seem uh the thought
[34:07] behind this may seem to be missing on
[34:09] its face but a fool expresses his anger
[34:12] and frustration immediately that's what
[34:15] it's saying that fool utth all his mind
[34:17] he he quick to express his rage and his
[34:20] disappointment and how you just made
[34:22] them feel it there's one translation
[34:24] that says it BR he brings out his wrath
[34:27] the fool brings out his wrath and just
[34:29] says it he cannot restrain it he cannot
[34:31] hide it it's it's just something he does
[34:34] but it says a wise man keepeth it end
[34:35] until afterwards till it passes what a
[34:38] wise person will do is restrain their
[34:41] passion in the moment they realize I'm
[34:43] angry I'm upset I probably shouldn't say
[34:45] anything right now wait till I cool off
[34:47] a little bit and then have a discussion
[34:49] about it and they wait until it passes
[34:51] maybe to address the issue but a fool
[34:53] just spews off his words just says he
[34:56] stirs up
[34:58] a furious man to Bound in a
[34:59] transgression because he just brings out
[35:02] his wrath the Bible says in Proverbs
[35:05] 12:18 there is that speaketh like the
[35:08] piercings of a sword but the tongue of
[35:11] the wise is
[35:13] Health it's talking about the just the
[35:15] Reckless talk where words become swords
[35:17] and they pierce and they thrust and they
[35:20] stab and they wound there's a way of
[35:22] speaking there's a tongue that a
[35:24] reckless way of talking that
[35:26] hurts so way of speaking that causes
[35:29] pain and causes
[35:31] injury but the tongue of the wise is
[35:33] health so words can hurt or words can
[35:37] heal words can cause further wounding or
[35:41] words can promote amending of that which
[35:43] is
[35:44] broken now this is where I I I realize
[35:48] tonight we're making very really good
[35:50] time on this so maybe I'd be able to
[35:53] slow down a little bit on some of this
[35:55] but it's at this point I want you to
[35:56] think about these principles we just
[35:58] shared and in light
[36:00] of the voice of Correction is the is the
[36:04] title but we've established that we must
[36:07] use the rod to correct our children but
[36:10] science tells us look what it's
[36:12] produced and we realize that if science
[36:16] says the punishment's wrong the physical
[36:18] punishment's wrong I would agree in that
[36:20] sense science is wrong but they're not
[36:22] wrong about what they've observed right
[36:25] because in some ways you read it they're
[36:27] just saying physical physical punishment
[36:29] corporal punishment has produced these
[36:31] outcomes and it's true in many ways it's
[36:34] not just a correlation there seems to be
[36:36] some causation to the behavior that's
[36:38] expressed to the children but we look at
[36:40] the word of God and says but the word
[36:41] says we ought to do it so then we have
[36:44] to look deeper at what the problem is
[36:46] because it's not just say well the
[36:48] problem is in the studies or uh the
[36:49] problem is this the problem's that how
[36:51] has the punishment been
[36:54] administered again it's not just
[36:55] spanking the child but there's a whole
[36:57] concept to it because you just take one
[36:59] scripture and it says you know beat him
[37:01] with the rod and he shall not die but
[37:04] keep continue to read in the Proverbs
[37:05] that kind of expresses the whole reality
[37:08] of parenting it's saying a soft answer
[37:10] turneth away wrath the tongue of the
[37:12] wise uses knowledge are right correct
[37:15] thy son you can't don't be delicate but
[37:17] don't be
[37:18] harsh our words so our voice which is
[37:22] the very words we use are even our
[37:24] demeanor our attitude when we're doing
[37:26] it it gives color to our correction say
[37:29] well I'm just spanking my child but what
[37:32] we're saying how we're saying it how
[37:34] we're doing it our tone our volume all
[37:36] those things gives context to the
[37:38] punishment and therefore that's what
[37:40] overall gives meaning to what you've
[37:42] just done now in our minds we may be
[37:45] thinking well if I just spank them the
[37:47] Bible says to spare not the rod uh
[37:49] otherwise you're going to ruin your
[37:50] child and we developed this concept from
[37:52] these things and and if I love my son
[37:54] I'm going to spank him and the Bible
[37:55] says bear chastisement and and I'm going
[37:57] to spank my children and we have this
[37:59] principle in our hearts and our minds
[38:01] and so we may see that very clearly but
[38:03] if in the ministering the punishment the
[38:06] right kind of atmosphere and the right
[38:08] kind of words aren't used and the whole
[38:10] scene creates a different kind of
[38:12] context our children aren't being
[38:14] benefited by the use of that principle
[38:17] to produce what the scripture says it
[38:18] will produce because our words have
[38:21] Chang the meaning for
[38:23] them the voice can either Aid in what
[38:26] you're trying to accomplish it can help
[38:28] you in your instruction help you in your
[38:29] correction or it can undermine it words
[38:33] can build up or they can tear
[38:36] down just just want to uh kind of Point
[38:39] our direction towards some of these
[38:41] statements in the scripture Ephesians
[38:43] 4:29 let no corrupt communication
[38:45] proceed out of your mouth now that's
[38:49] conversation words and things that tend
[38:51] to destroy costic things Eros corrosive
[38:55] things and it say let not these things
[38:57] things come out of your mouth now would
[38:59] that not apply to how we talk to one
[39:01] another does it not apply to how we
[39:03] would talk to our children let no
[39:04] corrupt communication proceed out of
[39:06] your mouth but that which is good to the
[39:08] use of edifying that it may Minister
[39:11] Grace unto the
[39:12] hears this is all leading up to the very
[39:15] instructions that he gives not only in
[39:16] marriage but to our children how it says
[39:19] provoke not your children to wrath but
[39:21] bring them up in the nurture and the
[39:22] admonition of the Lord does this not
[39:24] hearken back to let no corrupt
[39:26] communication proceed out of your mouth
[39:29] but Talk use a language use a tongue
[39:32] that edifies that ministers Grace to
[39:35] those that hear in Colossians chapter 4:
[39:38] 6 let your speech be all way with Grace
[39:41] seasoned with salt that ye may know how
[39:44] you ought to answer every man if we
[39:47] merely put that in the context of what
[39:48] am I going to say to the cashier when
[39:49] they ask me why I don't cut my hair why
[39:51] I'm wearing a skirt that my Sal speech
[39:53] be seasoned with uh salt it may may have
[39:55] Grace in the way that I answer this
[39:56] question perfect application but what
[39:59] about to one another what about at home
[40:01] what about in dealing with our children
[40:03] let your speech always be seasoned with
[40:06] salt Let It Be always with Grace let it
[40:09] let it be graceful let it be seasoned
[40:11] with salt that you may that it may give
[40:13] you the right response know how to
[40:15] respond because that's what Temperance
[40:17] is at the end of the day is the right
[40:19] response we've touched on this principle
[40:21] so I I didn't use the scripture tonight
[40:23] but it's in Ephesians chapter 4 where
[40:25] it's talking about the perfecting of the
[40:26] Saints a and the work of the ministry
[40:28] and it says speaking the truth in
[40:31] love this just said let no corrupt
[40:33] communication proceed out of your mouth
[40:34] and it's just said that God's going to
[40:36] give you these different offices and
[40:37] these different gifts that speaking the
[40:39] truth in love we may grow up into him in
[40:42] all things so it's not just merely
[40:44] speaking the truth to our children but
[40:46] it must be done in
[40:48] love and we can't uh we can't swap it
[40:50] out and just speaking the truth is love
[40:52] or speaking the truth that proves I love
[40:53] you but no the truth has to be spoken in
[40:56] love to be
[40:58] fruitful says let your speech be all
[41:00] with with Grace seasoned with salt what
[41:02] does salt do it preserves from
[41:03] corruption so this is how you keep from
[41:05] having corrupt communication you've
[41:07] seasoned
[41:09] it so your
[41:11] voice actually talking about
[41:13] inappropriately using voice in the
[41:15] context of even disciplining the wrong
[41:17] way inappropriately using voice your
[41:19] voice sets the
[41:22] tone your your voice is going to set the
[41:24] atmosphere of the attitude there's a way
[41:27] that even within oh we recognize this
[41:30] that even within dramas or plays or or
[41:33] or or movies that there can be a
[41:36] beautifully beautiful bolic scene or
[41:39] something beautiful and I oh well isn't
[41:41] that well that's a beautiful house or oh
[41:42] this is beautiful but all you need to do
[41:44] is start playing some ominous music
[41:46] right and immediately the scene changes
[41:48] all by the music that's being played and
[41:51] it creates a tone it sets certain
[41:53] expectations and and you get this sense
[41:55] something's bad's about to happen
[41:58] and and it's just the it's the music
[42:00] it's the tone it's the buildup and so
[42:03] our voice is the
[42:06] soundtrack our attitudes and what we're
[42:08] saying that's kind of creating the whole
[42:10] image you're the you're the producer
[42:11] you're the director you're the actor
[42:13] you're the one that's bringing all these
[42:14] elements together and your child is
[42:15] observing the correction as it comes to
[42:18] them and so your voice is is setting the
[42:21] tone for the correction for the
[42:23] discipline and so then how we express it
[42:26] is part of the
[42:29] standard it matters the
[42:32] manner in which we express the
[42:35] matter speaking the truth in love it
[42:38] matters the manner in which you express
[42:40] the
[42:42] matter James chapter 3:6 again I'm just
[42:45] wanting us to consider the multiple
[42:47] scriptures I know some of you tonight
[42:48] are thinking of a dozen other ones that
[42:50] I should have used James chapter 3: 6
[42:53] the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity
[42:57] so is the tongue among our members that
[42:59] it defileth the whole body and Seth on
[43:02] fire the course of Nature and it is set
[43:04] on fire of
[43:06] hell that's what this tongue can
[43:09] do that little Rudder can steer the
[43:11] ships think about what this tongue can
[43:13] do it's our it's our voice it's our our
[43:17] tongue that gives voice to our thoughts
[43:18] it's our thoughts that we meditate on
[43:21] then we give voice to it and it actually
[43:22] creates actions we're taught that our
[43:25] body will become subject to our
[43:26] confession
[43:27] I'm miserable I'm depressed I'm
[43:29] miserable I'm depressed well if you
[43:30] weren't you will be
[43:32] eventually right there's some there's
[43:34] power in the tongue think of how
[43:35] powerful this tongue is and so the
[43:38] tongue must be speaking the right things
[43:41] must be saying the right things must
[43:42] have a positive uh uh positive tone to
[43:46] it the subject matter even the tone and
[43:49] the motive behind it everything it has
[43:51] to that has to be considered when we're
[43:54] disciplining I think we've touched on
[43:56] this before but if you if you're angry
[43:58] when you correct then anger is going to
[44:00] be swn into that the frustration and
[44:03] anger it kind of colors our correction
[44:05] it colors and paints our discipline and
[44:07] it's in the very anger that we're
[44:09] expressing in our agitation and our
[44:11] frustration if that's if that's what's
[44:13] kind of coloring Us in the moment and
[44:15] that's what we're acting on this impulse
[44:16] and this frustration and we act out of
[44:19] that we might be wanting to achieve some
[44:22] uh immediate correction but also some
[44:24] long-term change of behavior but all
[44:26] we've done is swn into our children by
[44:28] our voice the same
[44:30] frustration and the same disappointment
[44:33] I make our entire effort to correct
[44:38] ineffective will you bear with me just a
[44:40] little bit
[44:42] more I know this is uh very simple
[44:45] things I think it's
[44:47] important a voice of
[44:50] Correction when I say the voice of
[44:52] Correction I'm talking about the mood
[44:53] you're in uh the words you use your
[44:56] temperament your your tone your
[44:59] volume I know it's hard enough to know
[45:01] when you ought to spank and when you
[45:02] shouldn't spank or what to correct for
[45:04] and how frequently and how often I know
[45:05] it's very very hard but it must be right
[45:07] your voice must be right when you're
[45:10] disciplining it's uh it's a challenge as
[45:13] a parent to know when to
[45:15] punish and what is
[45:18] appropriate but there's one thing I
[45:19] think we can get right and that's the
[45:22] voice there's a study done at
[45:25] Harvard they said parents who yell
[45:27] frequently are the mo ones who most are
[45:29] like who are most likely to hit
[45:32] frequently about the right use of the
[45:34] voice people who yell are more likely to
[45:38] hit they said children who are spanked
[45:41] and yelled at are more prone to spank
[45:44] and yell at their own children and
[45:47] they're not really making a distinction
[45:48] they're they're identifying the corporal
[45:50] punishment and the yelling that people
[45:52] who yell tend to spank now how do you
[45:54] think that's going to work out if things
[45:56] are being escalated with the voice and
[45:58] the tones getting louder and louder and
[45:59] it escalates to yelling and then it's in
[46:01] the yelling that they spank do we think
[46:04] that's going to achieve the right kind
[46:06] of attitude in our children what does it
[46:08] produce in the end science observes it
[46:10] and says these are a bunch of neurotics
[46:11] these are a bunch of crazy kids these
[46:13] are people that don't like uh their
[46:14] parents and they don't like instruction
[46:16] it's because the way that it's
[46:17] administered and they're connecting the
[46:19] yelling with the negative consequences
[46:21] of punishment this is what they're
[46:23] recognizing when they see this and
[46:25] there's a lot of very very re Recent
[46:27] research and this is it's just starting
[46:28] to add up that verbal abuse of children
[46:31] can be just as destructive emotionally
[46:33] as physical and sexual abuse and this
[46:36] may seem like a huge shock but it's
[46:37] saying that verbal abuse of children can
[46:40] be just as damaging emotionally as
[46:42] physical and sexual abuse that's
[46:44] staggering to think that but it's
[46:46] absolutely true and it's supported by
[46:49] scripture just how powerful the tongue
[46:52] is there was a study done by the
[46:54] University of Maryland go herps children
[46:57] who see their parents verbally abusing
[47:00] each other or more likely to be
[47:02] depressed or anxious and to experience
[47:04] more interpersonal problems of their own
[47:07] verbal aggression between the parents
[47:09] was more traumatic to Children than
[47:12] physical violence between
[47:14] parents so we might feel pretty good
[47:17] right that we don't beat our
[47:19] spouse and I I think that's a good
[47:23] thing but notice what it says about the
[47:25] way you can interact with your word
[47:27] words and just how insecure it can make
[47:30] a child
[47:31] feel in the way that we talk to one
[47:34] another this is kind of seven bad habits
[47:36] of highly and effective parents the way
[47:38] that we can talk to one
[47:40] another undermines the de proper
[47:43] development of our children children who
[47:46] see their parents arguing verbally
[47:48] abusing each other not just arguing but
[47:49] verbally abusing each other are more
[47:51] likely to be anxious and depressed and
[47:53] have more interpersonal problems why
[47:56] because something in the the security is
[47:58] broken there's something wrong there's a
[48:00] breach in the home there's something
[48:02] that has gone sideways and and there
[48:04] something that must be
[48:09] fixed Ephesians chapter 4: 31 and 32
[48:37] just trying to find a statement here
[48:39] that I just realize I don't have with me
[48:40] and I just want to be able to read it
[48:42] maybe
[48:45] tonight Ephesians chapter 4: 31- 32 it
[48:48] says let all bitterness and wrath and
[48:50] anger and clamor and evil speaking be
[48:53] put away from you with all
[48:55] malice this is again this is in
[48:57] Ephesians chapter 4 this is right here
[49:00] in the uh in the context of corrupt
[49:04] communication and edif speaking things
[49:06] that are edifying and even be building
[49:09] up to instructions in marriage and
[49:10] instructions to Children let all
[49:12] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[49:13] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[49:15] from you with all malice and be ye kind
[49:17] one to another tenderhearted forgiving
[49:19] one another even as God for Christ's
[49:22] sake hath forgiven
[49:23] you the image of God's patient love
[49:26] ought to Inspire is if we can consider
[49:28] how that God loves us and how the love
[49:30] of Christ is expressed to us and just
[49:32] what it's achieving in our lives that's
[49:34] the example of how that we ought to
[49:37] treat our children it struck me so
[49:39] deeply and so profoundly today that when
[49:42] the Bible is teaching us as parents and
[49:43] we read in the Proverbs and it's telling
[49:45] us all the things that we must do you
[49:47] realize that what God is telling us to
[49:49] do and that it would be right is what he
[49:52] does it's expressive of God's nature if
[49:55] he's saying don't do this do that then
[49:57] it's something about the way that what
[49:59] God would do and how he acts and it
[50:00] helps us to understand how the he is
[50:02] towards us as his children and when we
[50:05] read this that go even as God for
[50:07] Christ's sake have forgiven us that it
[50:09] ought to in turn allow us to be begin to
[50:11] look at one another differently behave
[50:13] towards one another differently and it's
[50:15] saying very clearly bitterness wrath and
[50:17] anger and clamor and evil speaking needs
[50:20] to be put away from us and I'm wanting
[50:22] us to associate that with the tongue
[50:24] that we use with our children
[50:27] our speech will season our
[50:29] discipline so let's season it with
[50:33] love we are to correct our children and
[50:35] we're to do it physically at
[50:38] times but spanking is not just an
[50:40] opportunity to vent your frustration it
[50:42] never
[50:46] is and looking at this and zeroing in on
[50:49] this idea of inappropriately using
[50:51] voice when you yell and you use harsh
[50:54] words they're result it's a result of
[50:56] frustration
[50:58] it's the result of this bitterness this
[50:59] wrath this anger and clamor and evil
[51:01] speaking when we yell or we use harsh
[51:03] words it's something that's been
[51:04] bubbling
[51:06] up and one of the downsides it's just
[51:10] one of them it's one of the biggest ones
[51:12] and this is just very practical one of
[51:13] the downsides to
[51:15] yelling it trains our children to
[51:18] wait until we're angry or loud enough
[51:21] before they
[51:22] react if you've established this rhythm
[51:24] with your CH your your your your kids
[51:26] your children and to where it's like you
[51:29] you you say it and you have to escalate
[51:32] then they learn and they're not they're
[51:33] not evil about it they've just realized
[51:37] wow when they raise their voice and they
[51:39] get mad that's when they really mean it
[51:41] and that's when there's consequence
[51:42] you've trained them that way you might
[51:45] want to say Well they're just stubborn
[51:46] and they're just rebellious no you
[51:48] taught them from a particular age that
[51:49] when you ask them to do something and
[51:51] they don't do it they realize okay maybe
[51:53] that was just a
[51:54] suggestion when there it's not de with
[51:56] immediately right they're thinking oh
[51:58] okay well then they asked me to do it
[52:00] they never followed up they never said
[52:01] anything and you've trained them early
[52:03] on before they can fully appreciate
[52:05] everything that's happening that it's
[52:07] not until you raise your voice that you
[52:10] have to do it because it's only then
[52:11] that punishment
[52:13] comes and so you're thinking man these
[52:15] children are stubborn no you've you're a
[52:17] good
[52:18] trainer right because it's only after
[52:21] you yell that you spank and that's the
[52:23] only point at which they thought you
[52:24] better get it done so when you've
[52:26] trained TR them correctly they obey when
[52:28] you
[52:29] yell right just think about the pract
[52:31] how practical it is once you've trained
[52:33] them correctly as soon as you yell they
[52:35] do it because it's exactly how you've
[52:37] taught them to
[52:39] act could we just have a breakout
[52:41] session on that and think about that for
[52:42] a while to me that that's I wish I wish
[52:45] that we had standing room only tonight
[52:47] to hear that so important to understand
[52:50] this I'd like to go into this more but I
[52:53] want to try to wrap this up just when we
[52:56] use loud aggressive tones negative tones
[53:00] got to be very careful that even when
[53:01] we're correcting there may seem to be it
[53:04] may seem to be taking away something but
[53:05] it must be positive in the way that you
[53:07] do it it's a way that you can lead with
[53:09] building up it's a way you can address a
[53:12] situation where you kind of you create
[53:14] that security in their heart that are in
[53:15] the safe place there someone that's
[53:17] mindful of me and has my best in mind is
[53:19] trying to promote the right kind of
[53:21] virtue there's a way that you can build
[53:23] up it's something that sister Elizabeth
[53:25] has spoken very highly about father how
[53:27] if he ever corrected he didn't lead with
[53:29] it there was a way he built you up and
[53:30] I'm proud of you and you're trying hard
[53:32] you're doing this you're doing that and
[53:33] then it builds the right kind of
[53:34] atmosphere to then bring in the area
[53:37] that needs to be addressed and so there
[53:39] it's more effective that way because if
[53:42] you're negative in how you lead it can
[53:44] create
[53:45] resentment at a very least maybe
[53:47] resistance and maybe at worst passive
[53:49] aggressiveness because there's this
[53:51] bitterness that's being born in their
[53:54] hearts there's there's ways that we can
[53:57] become we can just nag when we nag to
[53:59] our children it conditions them to
[54:01] ignore
[54:03] us and again not evil but because
[54:06] subconsciously if we nag subconsciously
[54:09] they know reminders will
[54:12] come this is just human psychology I I I
[54:15] if anything we should take away from
[54:17] this is these children we have here
[54:18] tonight are precious and no matter how
[54:21] stubborn and rebellious they might be if
[54:24] we could just recognize and this is
[54:25] where we could get into with holding
[54:26] Grace Just recognize they're the product
[54:28] of your nature and your nurture at this
[54:30] point if any we said 100% of the blame
[54:33] rest on me not for all of you but for
[54:35] mine at least I'm the one I give them
[54:38] the nature and I'm the one that's
[54:39] nurturing them and to realize that
[54:41] there's times when we are nagging and
[54:43] the nagging is just subconsciously they
[54:46] realize because of the the the Cadence
[54:48] and the Rhythm with which I'm met with
[54:50] this request without anything else
[54:52] changing then they know Mom will remind
[54:55] me Mom will remind me dad will remind me
[54:57] dad will remind me and we're actually
[54:59] conditioning them just to ignore us
[55:00] initially because when it really matters
[55:03] the alarm will go
[55:07] off may just maybe make reference to
[55:10] this and try to close with in in the
[55:11] Book of
[55:13] Numbers there's a way that we can use
[55:15] we've heard of positive reinforcement
[55:17] there's a way that we can negatively
[55:19] reinforce
[55:20] things and the wrong voice when we
[55:23] correct can encourage the very
[55:26] everything you're trying to
[55:28] correct you you the the you're meeting
[55:31] out some sort of punishment in order to
[55:33] correct a particular Behavior but your
[55:35] voice promotes
[55:36] it there's a way that we can talk to our
[55:39] children to say you're always doing this
[55:41] or you never do that and what we do is
[55:43] we begin to Define them by the issue
[55:46] begin to Define them by their mistake
[55:48] Define them by the problem and if we're
[55:49] not careful that there the mistake
[55:52] becomes a
[55:54] sentence and I'm not talking about
[55:55] grammar I'm talking about jail talking
[55:57] about bondage become identified by it
[56:00] and they live under it I've heard I I
[56:03] remember here recently uh been over a
[56:06] couple a couple years ago now we're
[56:07] meeting some of the neighbors and one of
[56:08] the kids just a young kid says yeah I'm
[56:11] the clumsy one in the family I'm the
[56:13] cluts I'm the one that's always banging
[56:15] in into things and immediately you could
[56:16] tell that's just what he's always been
[56:18] told I mean no kid sits down at 8 years
[56:21] old and goes what am I yeah I'm the
[56:23] cluts of the family don't even know you
[56:26] probably know what that was right but
[56:28] there's a way that we talk to him yeah
[56:30] he's the problem child he's the one that
[56:31] gives me trouble well he's the stubborn
[56:33] one and she's the catty one and we just
[56:36] kind of Define them that way and they
[56:38] just accept it yeah I'm the one that's
[56:40] always smarting
[56:41] off yeah I'm I'm the one that always
[56:43] gets angry and breaks things and they
[56:45] don't want to make you a liar
[56:47] right and so the next time there's an
[56:49] opportunity to get out your inner rage
[56:52] monster you break something you're like
[56:53] am I doing it right Dad you said I'm the
[56:55] angry one did I get
[56:58] it your words have so much weight so
[57:02] much power remember in the beginning we
[57:04] read in where brother bam says in
[57:07] wrongly about wrongly disciplining or we
[57:09] were using it in the context of t uh
[57:11] patience in wrongly discipline he says
[57:13] even one time when that Rebellion bunch
[57:15] of people had such impatience they
[57:18] caused Moses to do something that was
[57:21] wrong now if you want to go back and
[57:23] look at Numbers Chapter 20 I think I do
[57:24] have these verses here hopefully
[57:27] Numbers Chapter 20: 7 we'll read to
[57:29] verse 12 follow this I lost sight of my
[57:32] time am I doing good on
[57:33] time okay thank you and the word the
[57:37] Lord spake unto Moses saying catch this
[57:40] take the rod and gather thou the
[57:42] assembly together thou and Aaron thy
[57:44] brother and speak ye under the rock
[57:48] before their eyes and it shall give
[57:50] forth his water and thou shalt bring
[57:53] forth to them water out of the rock so
[57:56] Thou shalt give the congregation and
[57:57] their Beast drink now we read this and
[58:00] if it seems to be somewhat ambiguous
[58:02] maybe we could argue that maybe the
[58:04] instructions weren't very clear but we
[58:07] know that what God was asking him to do
[58:10] was to have the rod in his possession
[58:13] standing before the people and that
[58:14] Moses was to speak to the
[58:17] Rock and by the spoken word water would
[58:20] come forth out of a
[58:23] rock in verse n it starts out well and
[58:28] Moses took the rod from before the
[58:30] Lord as he was as he commanded
[58:33] him and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[58:35] congregation together before the Rock
[58:38] and now he's to speak to the
[58:40] rock this inanimate object this
[58:45] hard unmovable
[58:48] object that's what God told him to to
[58:50] doce to speak under the rock so Moses
[58:52] does exactly what God says and what does
[58:55] he do here now ye Rebels must we fetch
[58:58] your water out of this
[59:00] rock Moses lifted up his hand and with
[59:03] his Rod he smoked the rock
[59:06] twice the water came out abundantly and
[59:08] the congregation drank and their Beast
[59:09] also now I I Lord willing I want to pick
[59:12] up on this on
[59:13] Sunday in Christ my healer the the the
[59:17] way these two things have come together
[59:19] uh and even not being able to minister
[59:20] Sunday the way this begins to link up to
[59:22] me is very very exciting for me as a
[59:25] pastor but notice he smoked the rock
[59:28] twice and got the results that God said
[59:30] he was to have there's still
[59:33] water still Supernatural enough water
[59:36] came out to water them they drank and
[59:38] their Beast also but notice God's
[59:40] immediate response and God and the Lord
[59:42] spake unto Moses and Aaron because ye
[59:44] believed me not to sanctify me in the
[59:47] eyes of the children of Israel there was
[59:49] something about the act at this moment
[59:52] that was to sanctify God in the eyes of
[59:54] the children of Israel that that the
[59:56] focus wouldn't so much be on Moses and
[59:58] his motion but it would have to be in
[59:59] something Supernatural beyond the
[1:00:01] element of man therefore you shall not
[1:00:03] bring this Congregation of land which I
[1:00:05] have given them
[1:00:07] wow here's Moses who's led him up this
[1:00:10] far and because of this he can't enter
[1:00:12] into the promised
[1:00:15] land he said take the rod but speak to
[1:00:18] the Rock God has created a very deep and
[1:00:21] Powerful image in this that Moses breaks
[1:00:26] and so when he breaks it it it's such an
[1:00:28] offense that God in his in his wrath and
[1:00:31] his anger his retribution he deprives
[1:00:34] Moses of that opportunity of entering in
[1:00:36] and bringing the children into into the
[1:00:38] promised land now in Exodus chapter 17
[1:00:42] verses 5 and six I think I may have
[1:00:44] these this is when this is early on in
[1:00:47] The Exodus and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:00:50] go on before the people and take with
[1:00:51] thee of the Elders of Israel and thy rod
[1:00:54] so again just as he had said before uh
[1:00:57] take the rod and gather the people
[1:01:00] together and speak to the children of
[1:01:01] Israel if you go back earlier he said
[1:01:04] take the rod wherewith thou smot us the
[1:01:06] river take in thy hand and go behold I
[1:01:11] will stand before thee upon the rock in
[1:01:13] Horeb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and
[1:01:17] there shall come water out of it that
[1:01:19] the people may drink and Moses did so in
[1:01:23] the sight of the Elders of Israel
[1:01:26] now numbers 20 that I want you to do
[1:01:28] this that I might be Sanctified in the
[1:01:29] eyes of the children of Israel now I'm
[1:01:32] still talking about this seven bad
[1:01:34] habits of highly and effective parents
[1:01:35] this is still kids eat free I know maybe
[1:01:38] there's a lot of things that seem to be
[1:01:39] colliding in their minds right now so
[1:01:40] many beautifully Rich principles in The
[1:01:42] Exodus in the use of God's gifts and His
[1:01:44] prophets but recognize now as we bring
[1:01:47] Numbers Chapter 20 and Exodus chapter 17
[1:01:50] together early on in The
[1:01:52] Exodus when the children of Israel as a
[1:01:54] nation are young in this Exodus the rod
[1:01:57] was used to Smite The
[1:02:00] Rock Early in their
[1:02:02] training early in them learning what
[1:02:06] this journey was going to be about early
[1:02:07] in forming them to be able to take
[1:02:09] possession of the promised land Moses
[1:02:11] took the rod and he struck the rock to
[1:02:13] get something out of the Rock and it's
[1:02:15] demonstrative of our early training of a
[1:02:18] child using the rod to correct in the
[1:02:21] physical punishment but in numbers 20
[1:02:23] now 40 years later God tells them to
[1:02:27] take the rod so it's not as if it's been
[1:02:30] forsaken it Still Remains a part of this
[1:02:32] image it Still Remains as a part of the
[1:02:35] Vindication and the building up it it's
[1:02:37] it's part of thinking through this that
[1:02:39] we've arrived at this moment for this
[1:02:41] purpose so the rod is still part of the
[1:02:42] picture but he's not to use the rod he
[1:02:45] tells them to speak to the Rock speak to
[1:02:48] it don't Smite it and in one of the
[1:02:51] ancient mid rashes in in the Hebrew and
[1:02:54] and their teachings and their
[1:02:55] development ment of the Torah one of
[1:02:58] these early early the one on numbers uh
[1:03:00] chapter 20 it says when a child is small
[1:03:04] his teacher hits him and educates him
[1:03:08] but when he grows up he corrects him
[1:03:10] with
[1:03:12] words so there's a time there's a time
[1:03:15] for it but then there comes a moment and
[1:03:18] this is the part I hope you can really
[1:03:20] catch because I've preached myself into
[1:03:22] a problem it's really late now and I
[1:03:24] need to wrap this up but this is the
[1:03:26] moment now if you've used the you've
[1:03:28] used the
[1:03:29] rod that you use it with the child but
[1:03:32] there comes a time when you have to oh
[1:03:35] when he grows up you correct with your
[1:03:39] words so let's look at Moses for a
[1:03:41] second and consider this Moses is told
[1:03:44] to take the rod and speak to the Rock
[1:03:47] but what did he do he used his voice to
[1:03:49] Smite the
[1:03:50] people he stands before the car you
[1:03:53] don't find where God says speak to the
[1:03:55] stiff Israelites tell them they won't be
[1:03:57] able to enter in you certainly find it
[1:03:58] where God told them to use words of
[1:04:01] judgment to the children of Israel but
[1:04:02] he never told them to tell them that
[1:04:03] they were stiff necked he never told
[1:04:05] them to say they were hard-hearted but
[1:04:06] Moses gets up there seemingly in his
[1:04:09] impatience a and his anger he stands up
[1:04:12] there with the rod and when he was to
[1:04:14] speak to the Rock he spoke to their
[1:04:16] hearts and he said hear now ye
[1:04:21] rebeles he spoke to them with words and
[1:04:23] used his words to hurt and his words
[1:04:25] words to harm when he ought to have
[1:04:27] spoken to the
[1:04:31] Rock and in the beautiful way that the
[1:04:34] story
[1:04:35] unfolds and to use this image that when
[1:04:37] a child is small you use the rod to
[1:04:39] teach him and to educate him but when he
[1:04:41] grows up you have to use words to
[1:04:43] correct them with the rod of Correction
[1:04:45] having been established with discipline
[1:04:47] having been established with Exodus
[1:04:49] chapter 17 even using the rod to open up
[1:04:51] the the Red Sea now he could speak more
[1:04:54] effectively
[1:04:56] this is what I want you to to recognize
[1:04:59] that for Moses it was his own bitter
[1:05:01] words that betrayed his use of the
[1:05:04] rod it's his anger it's his frustration
[1:05:07] so what did he do he smoted it
[1:05:10] twice what's he doing there there's
[1:05:12] something being broken in this there's
[1:05:13] an image that's failing he failed in his
[1:05:16] words and because he failed in his words
[1:05:18] he resorted to being
[1:05:21] physical and when I what I'm wanting to
[1:05:23] end on this the voice of Correction
[1:05:24] there's going to come a time
[1:05:27] we will only be able to use words to
[1:05:30] correct come a time when you only have
[1:05:34] your words to correct your
[1:05:36] child and so you want to be sure that
[1:05:38] you haven't tainted
[1:05:40] them when that's all you have to
[1:05:43] use we need to be wise in how we form
[1:05:46] our children's sensitivity and their
[1:05:48] perception of that voice of
[1:05:52] Correction because Moses in that moment
[1:05:55] resorted to using the rod when all he
[1:05:58] haded to do was use his
[1:06:09] words it already it may already be there
[1:06:11] in this family that if I was someone who
[1:06:13] liked to get physical and push my kids
[1:06:16] around it might already be so in my
[1:06:18] family that if my son wanted to whoop me
[1:06:20] he
[1:06:21] could so where's the family then if you
[1:06:25] relied on being physically stronger it
[1:06:28] could inflict a greater amount of pain
[1:06:30] through your through physical punishment
[1:06:33] what happens when all you have left is
[1:06:35] words then the damage you cause is much
[1:06:38] deeper and much greater and it wounds
[1:06:40] even harder because you'll never see the
[1:06:42] scars that are being formed when you
[1:06:45] can't just physically throw your weight
[1:06:49] around oh I know this has maybe just
[1:06:51] gotten
[1:06:53] heavy brother brand makes the state in
[1:06:55] the sermon the uncertain sound he says
[1:06:58] we don't have any more security of the
[1:07:03] home says send your children to school
[1:07:05] what they do what do they teach them out
[1:07:07] there many times too many times they
[1:07:08] teach them we come from apes well we
[1:07:10] don't believe that no and if a man's no
[1:07:12] more than an animal then eat drink and
[1:07:13] be married that's what makes so many
[1:07:16] juvenile
[1:07:18] delinquents what we teach them we teach
[1:07:21] them that they're animals you treat them
[1:07:22] like animals he says that's what makes
[1:07:24] so many crimes committed because if
[1:07:26] people are no more than an animal it
[1:07:28] makes them act like an
[1:07:30] animal listen to this we got to tell
[1:07:33] them he's a Son of God born for the
[1:07:35] kingdom of God and he is
[1:07:38] somebody we got to use our language to
[1:07:41] build we got to use our language to
[1:07:42] praise we got to use our language tell
[1:07:44] them speak a positive gospel speak
[1:07:46] positive things create that atmosphere
[1:07:48] I'm only correcting you because the
[1:07:50] potential that's bound up in your heart
[1:07:52] I'm doing this because I want to bring
[1:07:54] out the best in you create that kind of
[1:07:56] security because he says we've lost
[1:07:57] Security in the home said well I'm going
[1:07:59] to bring security back we're going to
[1:08:00] start
[1:08:01] spanking no you'll make it even more
[1:08:04] insecure if you're not fostering the
[1:08:06] right kind of environment with your
[1:08:07] words and your demeanor got to tell him
[1:08:10] he's a Son of God born for the kingdom
[1:08:12] of
[1:08:14] God and he is
[1:08:19] somebody I think it was Sister
[1:08:21] Tasha brother jueles daughter every
[1:08:24] night when she'd pray for her son she'd
[1:08:25] tell him you're a mighty man of
[1:08:29] Valor she'd tell him every night son
[1:08:32] you're a mighty man of Valor then one
[1:08:33] day he said Mama you're a mighty man of
[1:08:36] Valor she said no I'm not honey and he
[1:08:39] goes don't you believe that lie of the
[1:08:44] devil but that's what we got to speak to
[1:08:46] our
[1:08:47] children we got to speak to them in a
[1:08:49] way that builds them up and brings that
[1:08:52] kind of security amen God bless you can
[1:08:55] we stand together
[1:08:57] tonight thank you for being patient with
[1:09:05] me the image of
[1:09:11] Moses hitting the people with his
[1:09:18] words and then using the rock excuse me
[1:09:22] the rod inappropriately I hope it can
[1:09:24] stay with us to
[1:09:26] realize that it's our words that kind of
[1:09:28] create the
[1:09:30] atmosphere and if we use the wrong words
[1:09:32] now with the rod the rod can be present
[1:09:37] but our words we won't have the words
[1:09:38] the context the voice of Correction to
[1:09:40] achieve the right result and as long as
[1:09:42] we feel that we have that hand that we
[1:09:44] can misuse it hope it makes sense to you
[1:09:46] tonight I really pray that it it's
[1:09:48] making sense for you could we bow our
[1:09:51] heads in a word of Prayer
[1:10:02] would there be a hand that would want to
[1:10:04] be raised and say Lord help me
[1:10:08] tonight I realized that in the
[1:10:10] congregation tonight there's many who
[1:10:12] know the days of raising their children
[1:10:14] has
[1:10:17] passed and there may seem to be some
[1:10:21] regret and maybe there's um
[1:10:25] a way that the devil would want to kind
[1:10:27] of wind that into your
[1:10:29] spirit you know you can just tell the
[1:10:32] Lord you're
[1:10:33] sorry say Lord forgive
[1:10:37] me you could even apologize to your
[1:10:40] children and say you know I didn't
[1:10:42] always do it the right
[1:10:46] way and just know that with God he never
[1:10:50] loses hope regarding your success
[1:10:56] God has a an unrelenting love for us as
[1:10:59] his
[1:11:00] children that no matter how long this
[1:11:02] continues he's never going to give up on
[1:11:05] you and if you can accept that for
[1:11:08] yourself and be confident that in
[1:11:11] yourself I think you can help heal
[1:11:12] wounds in our hearts stabilize us in our
[1:11:17] spirits and help us to have the right
[1:11:19] kind of attitude towards our children
[1:11:26] let's pray
[1:11:31] tonight as we pray let's remember
[1:11:34] brother Burley Williams in prayer he's
[1:11:36] had an accident today with his nail gun
[1:11:39] and the nail I don't know exactly how it
[1:11:41] happened but he was shot in the eye with
[1:11:43] his nail
[1:11:44] gun and uh by God's grace the surgery
[1:11:47] went well his Pastor brother Michel or
[1:11:49] his former Pastor brother Mike altig
[1:11:50] said that uh the injury won't affect his
[1:11:53] eyesight and so they're very grateful
[1:11:55] with how the surgery went he's at home
[1:11:57] resting but let's pray for brother

[1:12:59] why I've struggled or why I've suffered
[1:13:01] and Lord I'm speaking for all of us

[1:13:19] Lord you're not just using the word as a
[1:13:22] codal you're not just using the Bible as
[1:13:24] a
[1:13:25] a
[1:13:28] weapon or this message can be used to
[1:13:31] heal when others have used it to
[1:13:35] hurt and I pray Lord that you could help
[1:13:38] us today to focus right now in this
[1:13:41] prayer focus on your love for us your
[1:13:44] goodness and your
[1:13:46] kindness that Lord you have been there
[1:13:49] all the time you've been patient you've
[1:13:51] been
[1:13:52] kind we understand Lord that you have
[1:13:54] used used pain and
[1:13:56] suffering you've allowed us to endure
[1:13:59] great hurts and you've put us through
[1:14:01] great Affliction even as you did the
[1:14:02] children of Israel but you did it Lord
[1:14:05] for our good the Bible tells us for our
[1:14:08] profit for the betterment Lord we see
[1:14:11] the gain we see the we lift up now these
[1:14:13] hands though with this heaviness in
[1:14:16] heart we can lift up our hands and thank
[1:14:17] you for chastisement thank you for
[1:14:19] correction Lord we're focusing tonight
[1:14:22] on your goodness towards us as children
[1:14:26] Lord if we could do that Lord may it
[1:14:28] give us may there be May me recognize a
[1:14:31] Grace for ourselves where we have fallen
[1:14:33] so short as parents towards our own
[1:14:37] children those hearts and those lives
[1:14:39] are so precious Lord I see certain
[1:14:42] instincts and behaviors in my children
[1:14:44] and there might be things that I could
[1:14:45] get frustrated at and I could make
[1:14:47] comments about and I can write this
[1:14:49] write out a sentence I could Define them
[1:14:52] by that
[1:14:53] issue but Lord could it be that there
[1:14:55] I've
[1:14:56] only used my nature and my nurture to
[1:15:01] train them to be that
[1:15:05] way and that if I will just use the
[1:15:07] nurture and admonition of the Lord if I
[1:15:09] will just dig deep and use the care of
[1:15:12] the scripture and take the wisdom and
[1:15:14] the nature of the word and apply these
[1:15:16] principles that I can drive that very
[1:15:19] thing away from
[1:15:20] them Lord May there be a supernatural
[1:15:23] Deliverance T tonight Lord of the the
[1:15:26] negative instincts we have to reinforce
[1:15:28] in the wrong way and maybe Lord kind of
[1:15:31] the knee-jerk response to things to use
[1:15:33] the voice or to yell Lord May there just
[1:15:35] be a tendering uh tenderizing of our
[1:15:38] Spirits Lord Lord dial it down from 13
[1:15:42] Lord bring our volume down let May
[1:15:44] things just equalize better within our
[1:15:48] homes because Lord we realize that if we
[1:15:51] yell frequently we're more likely to hit
[1:15:53] frequently
[1:15:56] a way that that language and that voice
[1:15:58] and that tone create the
[1:16:01] whole the wrong perception of the
[1:16:04] correction then our children walk
[1:16:07] out and they repeat those behaviors
[1:16:09] themselves Lord let's break the cycle I
[1:16:11] pray help us to break the cycle may we
[1:16:13] do it in our homes as fathers may we do
[1:16:15] it as a church Lord in the way that we
[1:16:17] handle the word of God may we break
[1:16:19] these negative
[1:16:21] Cycles Lord for these people tonight so
[1:16:23] attentive and so Gra gracious I pray
[1:16:26] that you bless them and help
[1:16:27] them and all that they Endeavor to do

[1:16:33] married one day going to be mothers one
[1:16:35] day going to be fathers may seem
[1:16:38] irrelevant to them now may something
[1:16:40] take hold in their
[1:16:41] spirits that early on Lord they can
[1:16:45] train their child up in the way that it
[1:16:47] should go maybe we use these principles
[1:16:49] and how we relate to one another lord
[1:16:51] they're not lost in our Advanced age and
[1:16:53] our years Lord and our Rel relationships
[1:16:55] with one another let us make these
[1:16:56] things
[1:16:57] applicable granted I pray tonight as we
