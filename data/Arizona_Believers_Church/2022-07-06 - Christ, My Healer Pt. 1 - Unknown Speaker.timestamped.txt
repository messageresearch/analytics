[0:00] my tie-in for this subject kind of goes
[0:03] back to what we're speaking on under the
[0:05] sycamore tree
[0:06] on
[0:07] last Sunday but the Sunday before and we
[0:10] were arriving at a particular place
[0:12] where we mentioned how the church is a
[0:14] place as we saw with the sycamore tree
[0:15] with Bartimaeus and zacchus it's a place
[0:18] where there's salvation and Divine
[0:21] Healing or at least church should be a
[0:23] place where those things are taught and
[0:25] ultimately where those things are
[0:26] available for them to be received and we
[0:29] took some time to address kind of lay
[0:31] out a little bit on Divine Healing
[0:33] address a little bit about salvation and
[0:35] we mentioned how that we were wanting to
[0:37] start a series on Divine Healing and I
[0:40] wanted to make some comments at the
[0:42] outset and tonight's just going to be
[0:43] foundational
[0:44] and it's interesting when it comes to
[0:47] Salvation and it comes to Divine Healing
[0:49] I'm going to put it this way there's
[0:50] some odd controversies related to both
[0:52] anybody okay good we're maybe all
[0:55] familiar with some of them unfortunately
[0:57] maybe we're all familiar with some of
[0:58] the odd controversies
[1:01] um that exist with respect to Divine
[1:03] Healing and salvation some of the
[1:05] controversies make uh make salvation or
[1:08] even Divine Healing Obsolete and you
[1:10] think salvation obsolete yes there's
[1:13] some that believe there's no more
[1:14] salvation there's some that believe that
[1:16] salvation doesn't apply anymore because
[1:19] of certain events or circumstances and
[1:21] there's also those that believe that uh
[1:23] Divine Healing is no longer available
[1:26] and that it's obsolete and there's some
[1:28] that there's some misplacement of even
[1:30] salvation and some misplacement of of
[1:33] Divine Healing and we're not necessarily
[1:35] going to get into the details of the
[1:37] misplacing or the the opposite those
[1:39] that make it obsolete but one of the
[1:40] worst things and maybe that's what I was
[1:42] maybe coming to on Sunday but I left off
[1:45] of it is that there's some that make
[1:47] salvation and Divine Healing compete and
[1:50] they make them where one is preferred
[1:52] over the other or one's better than the
[1:53] other we know that one would be
[1:55] preferred or the other but they do it
[1:57] they make them compete in that one beats
[1:59] the other one down and makes the other
[2:01] one worthless or makes the other one
[2:02] seem as if it's not anything and you
[2:04] might think well I don't I'm not
[2:06] familiar with that but I can actually I
[2:08] was a witness to a situation one time
[2:10] where a minister and another person
[2:11] seeking counsel or discussing Divine
[2:13] Healing and this person wanted to see a
[2:16] miracle in their life and they asked the
[2:18] minister basically do you believe in
[2:20] Divine Healing and instead of the
[2:22] minister just saying yes I believe in
[2:23] Divine Healing he wanted to say you know
[2:25] Salvation is greater than Divine Healing
[2:27] and salvation is what we believe in and
[2:29] the person said I just want to know that
[2:31] you believe in Divine Healing if you
[2:32] pray for me and they started arguing and
[2:34] I had to actually break up almost a fist
[2:36] fight
[2:37] between a minister and a man seeking
[2:39] Divine Healing seeking healing because
[2:42] they made the two compete salvation is
[2:44] the greatest I just need to be healed
[2:46] but Salvation is greater I just want to
[2:47] be healed and so maybe that helps inform
[2:50] you a little bit there's times when we
[2:51] make them compete but the subject I want
[2:54] to start whether it be a series or a
[2:56] segment but the title is Christ my
[2:58] healer and I'm tiling it this way so
[3:00] that you can make it personal this isn't
[3:02] about brother Aaron this is you Christ
[3:04] my healer you say maybe a segment or
[3:06] series about Divine Healing
[3:08] in referring to Divine Healing and the
[3:12] scriptures that support it it will be
[3:13] even maybe looking into the reasons that
[3:16] God gives gifts in the church looking at
[3:18] even the manifestation of the spirit and
[3:21] in doing so there's a lot of subjects we
[3:23] could visit there's a lot that are
[3:24] within my view a lot that we're touching
[3:26] on as we study and we will visit
[3:28] subjects such as miracles signs and
[3:29] wonders and the way that God moves and
[3:31] those things one of the things we've
[3:33] been looking at is the purpose of the
[3:34] Altar and a lot of uh
[3:37] and and just a lot of different things
[3:39] that we're familiar with that mean
[3:41] something to us that we're taught that
[3:43] maybe we've experienced in our lives
[3:44] just a lot of a lot of subjects to touch
[3:46] on but I want to do it in the context of
[3:48] the present truth not that these things
[3:50] would be the ultimate but how they all
[3:52] build together to create rapturing faith
[3:55] and so tonight as you may be familiar
[3:57] with me I'm just going to be laying out
[3:58] a lot of materials on out to kind of lay
[4:01] my materials out materials that may not
[4:02] create a foundation but can be used for
[4:05] a foundation so trust that you can be
[4:07] patient with me while I do some
[4:08] groundwork and if it's not perfectly
[4:11] fruitful for you just know it's fruitful
[4:13] for me and it'll help me in future
[4:14] services to be able to go through this
[4:16] endeavor because we're wanting to put
[4:18] the pieces on the table so you can start
[4:19] to identify what we're going to be
[4:21] looking at and as I've titled this
[4:24] Christ My Healer again I want it to be
[4:27] personal to you I really desire this to
[4:30] be something that you could take some
[4:31] personal ownership in and I'm wanting to
[4:33] preach these things as a way of
[4:35] encouraging your faith and in doing that
[4:38] it would uh we're nurturing that Faith
[4:40] to grow and that it can go from Faith to
[4:42] perfect faith and your faith can grow
[4:44] into full measures we recognize that in
[4:46] the scripture one of the statements I've
[4:48] been coming across quite a bit over the
[4:50] last little bit is from the sermon
[4:52] expectations I think we may have used
[4:54] this sometime last year Billy Bam says
[4:56] give your faith a chance turn it loose
[4:59] unbridle it let it work and that's what
[5:02] we want we are we want our faith to be
[5:03] turned loose we want to be unbridled we
[5:05] want it to work he says you've got it
[5:07] all bound down with traditions and this
[5:10] is where we can make it personal because
[5:12] we could say as a church we don't have
[5:13] tradition we could say as a message we
[5:15] don't have traditions and we've been
[5:16] loose from traditions and we can make a
[5:18] lot of uh lip service to that so then
[5:21] we'll just make it personal to you as
[5:24] individuals that we do not want our
[5:26] faith to be bound by any Traditions he
[5:28] says turn it loose unbridle it let it
[5:30] work you've got it all bound down with
[5:32] traditions and he says turn it loose cut
[5:34] it Loose let God have his way with you
[5:37] it makes a statement somebody's words
[5:40] right either what you're looking at or
[5:42] What God Says
[5:44] and so sometimes there's some
[5:45] competition if somebody's word what
[5:46] you're looking at or what God says it
[5:48] can be a matter of our orientation
[5:50] towards something what we're viewing
[5:52] either what you're looking at or what
[5:54] God says God's word is true believe it
[5:57] and so these things we're going to be
[5:59] looking at in order to unbridle our
[6:01] faith give Faith the chance and as it
[6:04] just kind of strikes my heart now
[6:05] there's times we look at the word of God
[6:06] and say the word of God there's healing
[6:08] in the word of God but we have the
[6:09] question well I just don't know if it's
[6:11] for me and there's something that we're
[6:13] looking at that's causing us to think
[6:15] less of ourselves or Unworthy of a
[6:17] promise so it's important to kind of
[6:19] challenge ourselves too not come up with
[6:21] the conditions under which God's word
[6:23] needs to work but just take God at his
[6:25] word
[6:27] and and as you turn to Romans chapter 10
[6:29] verse 17
[6:31] . I want to touch on the importance of
[6:33] of doctrine that maybe the how far we'll
[6:35] get to this evening is touching on the
[6:37] importance of Doctrine and teaching and
[6:40] because we're going to be wanting to
[6:41] gain an understanding of what divine uh
[6:43] what Divine Healing is or maybe put this
[6:46] way what Divine Healing is based on we
[6:48] talk about Christ my healer what am I
[6:50] basing that on in Romans chapter 10
[6:54] verse 37 it says so then Faith cometh by
[6:56] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[6:58] one of the most maybe pronounced
[7:00] scriptures that we know Faith cometh by
[7:02] hearing and that hearing then by the
[7:04] word of gods we have to hear the word of
[7:06] God for Faith to come brother Bram and
[7:09] the sermon believeth thou this he says
[7:10] faith cometh by hearing hearing of the
[7:12] word of God that's what gives us Faith
[7:15] before we can have faith we must have a
[7:18] basis for Faith now we're familiar with
[7:20] dozens of statements uh with respect to
[7:22] that and I would even say uh we're
[7:25] familiar that faith has to have a
[7:27] resting place
[7:31] in Faith's final resting place is always
[7:33] the word of God that's what we have to
[7:35] base it on that's why when people share
[7:38] testimonies or they're telling you what
[7:40] God did in their life it's important
[7:42] that you not put your faith on the
[7:44] specifics of their life on the structure
[7:46] maybe that God built in their life for
[7:48] the breadcrumbs in their life but you
[7:50] put it on the foundation or the basis
[7:52] that brought that to path my wife was
[7:55] testifying to someone and expressing
[7:58] what God had done in our lives at one
[8:00] time and then they came someone came
[8:02] back around later and said that's what
[8:03] we're wanting to happen in our lives
[8:04] we're going to do the same thing and
[8:06] it's and you want to be careful in that
[8:09] situation because they may think well
[8:10] they did it so I'll do the same thing
[8:12] and get the same results but it has to
[8:14] be your faith has to be based on
[8:16] something it has to be based on a
[8:18] promise not just doing what somebody
[8:19] else did and thinking you're going to
[8:21] get the same results if somebody
[8:22] testifies we don't want to make it
[8:24] anecdotal in that we're only looking at
[8:26] what happened but we want to know the
[8:28] basis for their faith that produce the
[8:30] results and so Faith must have a basis
[8:34] and we know that it it's the word of God
[8:35] and I want to touch on this even though
[8:38] I know that you know it so this is
[8:40] really maybe just for me but the devil's
[8:42] tactic has always been to cause
[8:44] confusion concerning God's truth
[8:46] that's his tactic he he knows what God
[8:49] has said he knows God's promises he
[8:51] knows God's nature and his character so
[8:53] he is not going to be successful in
[8:56] destroying God but he wants to destroy
[8:57] our confidence in God's word cause
[9:00] confusion about God's will cause
[9:01] confusion about God's truth which we
[9:03] know is his word Jesus in John chapter 8
[9:07] verses 43 and 44 says why do you not
[9:09] understand my speech even because you
[9:12] cannot hear my word why do you
[9:14] understand my accent or my dialect why
[9:16] do you not know where I'm from he says
[9:18] because you cannot hear my word they
[9:19] heard his Audible Voice but there was
[9:22] still something missing there was not a
[9:24] connection being made so there's a lack
[9:25] of understanding of what he was teaching
[9:27] they weren't picking up what he was
[9:29] saying and notice the the immediate
[9:31] statement he makes as a way of answering
[9:35] further this question of why they do not
[9:38] understand his speech year of your
[9:40] father the devil well that was really
[9:41] nice
[9:42] and the lust of your father ye will do
[9:45] now this is certainly a rebuke to them
[9:46] because they said we are not born of
[9:48] fornication we are of Our Father Abraham
[9:50] and they did not want to be likened to
[9:52] the uh the Cain who was of that Wicked
[9:55] one so he says you are of your father
[9:57] the devil and the lust of your father ye
[9:59] will do he was a murderer from the
[10:01] beginning and Abode not in the truth
[10:04] talk about the devil now because there
[10:07] is no truth in him
[10:09] so why do they not understand Christ's
[10:12] speech why why is it they cannot hear
[10:14] his word because the devil's a liar
[10:17] and when you speaketh a lie he speaketh
[10:19] of his own for he is a liar and the
[10:21] father of it
[10:23] so when the devil speaks he speaks
[10:24] against truth and the devil speaks he
[10:27] speaks to confuse truth and confound us
[10:29] concerning God's truth so it's it is his
[10:32] nature it is his tactic to use lies to
[10:35] confuse the truth even to the point of
[10:38] telling a half truth or part truth or
[10:40] something that can be 99 true but the
[10:42] one percent lie be the leaven that mixes
[10:45] within it and and and defiles it and so
[10:48] it's a common tactic of the devil to
[10:50] create a perception of conflict within
[10:53] the word of God
[10:54] and I want you to ponder this very
[10:56] deeply I want to make this part of the
[10:58] foundation that the word of God does not
[11:00] contradict itself
[11:02] there is no there is no promise of God
[11:04] so God promised me this but he promised
[11:06] me that and both can't be true
[11:08] right you cannot look at the word of God
[11:10] in such a way to where it contradicts
[11:12] itself so the devil wants you to
[11:14] perceive a conflict in the word of God
[11:17] to make the word itself fight against
[11:19] itself and then you have to choose a
[11:21] winner
[11:22] and you have to choose one that's better
[11:24] one that's greater one that's right or
[11:26] one that's correct and so the devil
[11:28] wants to make the word of God appear to
[11:30] be fighting against itself so that you
[11:33] take sides and choose one part of the
[11:35] word at the at the detriment of another
[11:37] part and then as soon as you make that
[11:40] choice you can become a champion of one
[11:42] particular side take ownership of a
[11:44] particular Viewpoint and then really
[11:46] begin to Rally behind a particular way
[11:48] of seeing it and you find yourself in
[11:50] defense or in championing one view you
[11:53] have to tear down the other
[11:55] and you can think you're doing the
[11:56] Lord's work while you're doing it
[11:57] because the devil has tricked us in
[11:59] defining a contradiction when there
[12:02] really isn't one
[12:04] and the message God of this evil age he
[12:06] says we find now this evil age is to
[12:09] prove to Satan she's not like Eve that
[12:11] she is not that type of a woman
[12:14] the way this statement strikes me and
[12:16] and I I just I know in reading it now
[12:19] this evil age is to prove to Satan she's
[12:22] not like Eve it strikes me that this age
[12:25] is evil to prove you're not like Eve now
[12:29] as God has allowed it to become this
[12:30] evil and become the Pinnacle and the
[12:32] climax of Satan's Eden so you can prove
[12:35] that you're not that type of woman not
[12:37] in the sanctity of God's Eden but in the
[12:40] midst of Satan's Eden God has allowed it
[12:42] to be this evil and God has allowed it
[12:44] to be an evil age so that you can prove
[12:47] as the elect that you're not that type
[12:49] of a woman
[12:51] it says and she will be Tried by his
[12:53] word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried
[12:56] by the word and Adam's bride believed
[12:58] every bit of a word all but confused on
[13:03] one promise
[13:04] so this is Satan's tactic to cause
[13:06] confusion this is one way of describing
[13:08] the fall in the beginning is because
[13:10] there was a repudiation of Truth it was
[13:12] Rebellion it was Disobedience and they
[13:14] contradicted God's clear instruction to
[13:16] not eat fruit of the tree but once you
[13:18] get into it you realize maybe it wasn't
[13:19] just clear instructions and not eat
[13:21] physical fruit because that would have
[13:22] been a little bit uh misleading perhaps
[13:24] in the things that we read but it was
[13:26] clearly a confusion about the promise
[13:30] and he says the promise that he's the
[13:31] same yesterday today and forever today
[13:33] see but failed on One Promise under the
[13:37] temptation of the enemy face to face
[13:39] what a way to describe Eve's failure
[13:41] confused on the promise that he's the
[13:43] same yesterday today and forever or
[13:45] failed on that promise but failed under
[13:48] face-to-face temptation of the enemy
[13:51] and now the people that's called for his
[13:53] name of course is his bride
[13:55] she is to come and contact Again by the
[13:58] same thing I read that to mean the bride
[14:00] is going to have to come face to face
[14:02] with the devil and be tempted face to
[14:04] face with the Enemy and be tempted not
[14:07] by just denominational truth or
[14:09] something but every word not to test
[14:11] your denominational truth not to test
[14:13] your message subculture not just to test
[14:15] uh certain things that relate to social
[14:18] and political attributes of church and
[14:19] the fellowships we have but you're going
[14:21] to be Tried by every word
[14:24] for in the beginning of the Bible man
[14:25] was given the word of God to live by one
[14:28] word misinterpreted by a man called
[14:31] Satan in a person of an animal called
[14:33] The Serpent Satan in this person could
[14:36] talk to Eve and misinterpreted the word
[14:38] to her and was lost see it must be every
[14:42] word
[14:44] now that uh
[14:46] that makes it kind of that drills it
[14:47] down pretty tight so we say well if
[14:49] we're going to have to if we're going to
[14:51] be tempted by the same thing
[14:54] then it's have to be a Temptation face
[14:56] to face and it was Satan in an animal
[14:59] called The Serpent or in
[15:01] misinterpretation by a man
[15:03] and we can start saying well then who
[15:05] who are these people right and we say
[15:07] stop the tape we're going to name names
[15:09] no that's not what we need to do we need
[15:12] discernment to recognize the devil and
[15:15] every one of his tricks
[15:17] because he's going to come in such a way
[15:19] to try to cause confusion about the word
[15:21] even to the point where Christ says if
[15:23] you weren't elect and if it wasn't
[15:24] impossible it would deceive us so
[15:27] there's no walking away bragging tonight
[15:28] that we're not deceived by the devil in
[15:30] this misinterpretation of one word of
[15:33] God in the way that he can bind things
[15:35] together and cause confusion we don't
[15:36] brag on that we recognize it's the grace
[15:39] of God if we recognize truth and hold to
[15:42] it
[15:43] so Satan's tactic is to cause confusion
[15:46] and I want to I want to put it in this
[15:47] sense to perceive a contradiction in the
[15:50] word of God so that we use the word to
[15:52] tear down another part of the word
[15:54] and we want to be very careful we find
[15:57] if you look at church history and you
[15:58] even find disagreements that men many
[16:00] times we never I said take that back not
[16:02] just men will just put us all in there I
[16:04] don't want to be a reverse chauvinist
[16:06] whatever that would be uh but there's a
[16:11] there's a way that we can it's an
[16:14] instinct maybe to tear down things you
[16:16] don't understand
[16:17] that if you don't understand it you just
[16:19] tear it down if you don't understand it
[16:21] you speak against if you don't
[16:22] understand it uh you want to discredit
[16:24] it and you want to talk against it and
[16:26] we want to be very careful that if we
[16:27] don't understand something or just
[16:29] because we don't understand it be very
[16:31] careful not to tear it down or to
[16:33] criticize it because I think that's a
[16:35] weakness of humanity is to speak against
[16:37] and lash out and fight against or resist
[16:39] things that they don't understand I hope
[16:42] you could just put that in the context
[16:43] that I mean it
[16:45] now in second Timothy chapter 3 verses
[16:47] 16 and 17. it says all scriptures given
[16:50] by inspiration of God and is profitable
[16:52] for Doctrine for reproof for correction
[16:56] for instruction in righteousness this is
[16:58] the important part that the man of God
[17:00] may be perfect truly furnished unto all
[17:03] good works I believe that we ought to
[17:05] read this in the sense that if this all
[17:07] scripture is given by the Breath of God
[17:08] it's inspired by God and is profitable
[17:11] and useful and made for Doctrine reproof
[17:14] correction instruction and righteousness
[17:16] that if it wasn't for verse 17 the rest
[17:19] of it really wouldn't be useful
[17:22] it's for a purpose even the the doctrine
[17:24] the reproof the correction the
[17:25] instruction and so that the man of God
[17:27] may be perfect throughly furnished unto
[17:30] all good works so the word which is
[17:32] given by the inspiration of God is for
[17:34] our perfecting or our full furnishing
[17:37] means to furnish perfectly so we are
[17:40] furnished perfectly unto all good works
[17:42] we're made perfect by Doctrine by
[17:44] reproof by correction by instruction
[17:46] those are the things that perfect the
[17:49] person
[17:49] now think about that that's what
[17:51] perfects us we might have ideas of what
[17:54] perfects us and I'm not saying your idea
[17:56] is wrong your idea will fit in one of
[17:58] these categories
[18:00] people say well we don't really get lost
[18:02] caught up in Doctrine we just preach we
[18:04] just like to preach uh Divine Healing
[18:06] well that's a Doctrine
[18:09] so I I wanted to preach a I think it was
[18:12] a series I can't remember what it was in
[18:13] the title I wanted to preach is Doctrine
[18:15] is not a dirty word and my wife said no
[18:16] that's two edgy so I changed it and I
[18:18] called it good Doctrine is not bad
[18:21] and so there's a there's Doctrine is
[18:24] it's essential to everything we believe
[18:27] Doctrine is that which is taught
[18:30] a Doctrine or is it means to teach
[18:32] precepts to explain or expound a thing
[18:35] to someone
[18:36] and so all scripture is probable for
[18:38] Doctrine and then there's reproved
[18:39] correction instruction but it's
[18:41] profitable for Doctrine it's profitably
[18:43] to be taught
[18:45] the precepts of the scripture it's worth
[18:47] it to take time to teach the things of
[18:50] God so that we could understand the
[18:51] things of God so this this entire
[18:54] thought on Christ my healer it's
[18:55] teaching on Christ
[18:57] it is teaching on the doctrine of Christ
[19:00] Christ even his teachings and his
[19:02] doctrines in order to give a basis for
[19:04] our faith so that we can place our faith
[19:07] so that it can grow and and I would say
[19:09] that is for salvation it is for healing
[19:12] it is for leadership is for discernment
[19:14] it is so that you can be perfect
[19:17] and perfectly furnished unto all good
[19:20] works
[19:21] brother Bradham when he preaches the
[19:23] seven Church ages in 1954 I'm just going
[19:26] to reference this very quickly he says I
[19:27] just love teaching oh my I think it's
[19:30] wonderful it gives the basis and settles
[19:33] the church
[19:36] that's what teaching does it gives a
[19:38] basis
[19:39] and it settles the church
[19:42] so it's an important part
[19:44] of our fellowship with God it's an
[19:46] important part of our diet as Christians
[19:47] to have the right kind of teaching he's
[19:49] even here as we look in at this
[19:51] scripture Our Perfection depends on good
[19:53] Doctrine
[19:54] our Perfection depends on correct
[19:56] teaching and
[19:58] it is that the man of God may be perfect
[20:01] throughly furnished unto all good works
[20:03] if I can say this it's necessary for a
[20:05] rapture
[20:07] in Psalms 103 this is what we read
[20:10] in the in the beginning as our text
[20:13] I'd like to spend more time on this I'll
[20:15] just touch on it very quickly tonight
[20:17] I had originally as my text tonight in
[20:20] Psalms 107.
[20:22] or he says he sent
[20:23] his word
[20:25] and healed
[20:27] healed them
[20:29] and I just found that I wasn't going to
[20:31] have time to get to it so we're gonna uh
[20:34] just look at this part here in Psalms
[20:37] 103 verses 1 to 5. if you could just
[20:39] focus on this as we read through it
[20:40] maybe we'll visit some things as we read
[20:42] or after we're done reading bless the
[20:44] Lord O my soul and all that is within me
[20:45] bless His holy name
[20:47] bless the Lord O my soul and forget not
[20:51] not forget not all of his benefits
[20:54] that's where it benefits in the Hebrews
[20:56] translated to reward it's translated to
[20:58] dessert or that get what you deserve not
[21:00] the kind that we want to have later on
[21:01] and uh at Culver's or someplace but it
[21:05] is a it is what someone deserves it's
[21:07] translated to recompense and so it is
[21:10] something given forget not all his
[21:12] benefits his rewards the desserts that
[21:14] we deserve of the recompense or the
[21:16] things that he has given us something
[21:18] given
[21:19] and the word this word reward is
[21:21] translated to recompense here benefits
[21:23] forget not all his benefits it comes
[21:26] from the word to deal fully with or to
[21:28] ripen so when there's recompense when
[21:31] there's rewards someone's been fully
[21:32] dealt with it it speaks of a ripening
[21:34] even the weaning of a child so it's some
[21:36] sort of growth and development that's
[21:38] related to these benefits something that
[21:41] has achieved that God is granting to us
[21:43] these rewards and it has to do with
[21:45] development to deal fully with or to
[21:48] ripeness forget not all his benefits and
[21:51] I believe he describes these benefits in
[21:53] verse 3 who forgiveth all thine
[21:55] iniquities this is a benefit the
[21:57] Forgiveness of iniquities who healeth
[22:00] all thy diseases this is one of the
[22:02] benefits this is one of the rewards this
[22:03] is one of the things that is given who
[22:05] redeemeth thy life from destruction
[22:08] there's so much that can be Amplified in
[22:10] these as you Ponder them who crowneth
[22:12] thee with loving kindness and Tender
[22:14] Mercies isn't that wonderful
[22:16] these are his benefits who satisfy thy
[22:19] mouth with good things this could be
[22:21] natural and spiritual but I believe he's
[22:23] speaking more profoundly to the
[22:25] spiritual man this these are the
[22:28] benefits of God
[22:30] that were told not to forget when we
[22:32] bless the Lord we consider his benefits
[22:33] his benefits of Salvation and healing
[22:35] Redemption this crowning and even the
[22:37] satisfying and a notice so that thy
[22:40] youth is renewed like the eagles
[22:44] again just as the scripture said that
[22:45] all the scripture is given uh by
[22:47] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[22:49] Doctrine reproof correction and
[22:51] instruction that you may be perfect now
[22:54] he gives us all these benefits of
[22:56] forgiveness healing Redemption crowning
[22:59] satisfaction so that your youth is
[23:01] renewed
[23:03] so there's a growing in God's grace
[23:04] there's an experience of All His
[23:06] blessings as we walk into Eternal youth
[23:10] right there's a renewing of our youth we
[23:13] can see this most perfectly in the
[23:15] change of our body to achieve a a a a
[23:19] state of being where you remain 18 to 21
[23:22] years old forever
[23:24] right
[23:25] we're not going to be changed just to
[23:27] enter into another cycle of life and
[23:30] then death and wouldn't it be horrible
[23:31] to wake up 18 years old like wow isn't
[23:34] this wonderful next thing you know you
[23:35] start aging again
[23:36] that's not what's going to happen it's
[23:38] going to be a renewal of Youth it speaks
[23:40] of a resurrection it speaks of a Rapture
[23:41] which Divine Healing is the earnest of
[23:45] but notice these things are necessary
[23:47] and these acts of God's benefits in your
[23:50] life of forgiveness of iniquity healing
[23:52] of thy diseases Redemption from
[23:54] destruction crowning with loving
[23:56] kindness and Tender Mercies satisfying
[23:58] thy mouth with good things is necessary
[24:00] for the renewal of our youth
[24:02] and the keeping fresh of our experience
[24:04] with Christ
[24:06] in Galatians chapter 5 verses 7 to 9
[24:10] and there's a lot of backgrounding we
[24:12] could give to this but I trust you
[24:13] already know it
[24:15] Paul in his rebuke of the Galatians I
[24:16] believe it's in chapter three he says
[24:17] who has Bewitched you
[24:21] and so he was dealing with these
[24:23] influences that kind of came in and took
[24:25] them from where they were of their
[24:26] steadfast faith and what they had
[24:28] previously been taught by Paul
[24:30] and their stability in the gospel and
[24:33] the present truth and then other people
[24:35] come in and start mixing with it and
[24:37] blending it and distracting them and he
[24:39] had to rebuke them of falling away from
[24:43] Christ and listening to other things
[24:46] that detracted from the truth and so he
[24:49] says you did run well who did hinder you
[24:53] that you should not obey the truth
[24:55] a tremendous question you ran well you
[24:58] were doing good but at some point in
[25:00] your running you were hindered and so he
[25:03] asked the question who did this who
[25:05] hindered you and he uses this phrase to
[25:08] describe those that hindered him or the
[25:10] thing that hindered him as this
[25:12] persuasion this persuasion cometh not of
[25:15] him that calleth you a little leaven
[25:18] leaveneth the whole lump a persuasion is
[25:21] to induce to believe in this sense it is
[25:23] to believe by words to induce to believe
[25:25] by words in a deceptive sense or a
[25:28] negative sense this persuasion you have
[25:31] been induced by words to believe
[25:33] something that is not true this
[25:35] persuasion did not come by him that
[25:37] called you
[25:38] you ran well but now you're being
[25:40] hindered because you're being induced by
[25:42] words to believe something that is not
[25:44] expedient you've been induced by
[25:46] teaching and by air to slow down to no
[25:49] longer reach for the right things and he
[25:51] says a little leaven leaveneth the whole
[25:53] lump
[25:54] leaven is ultimately a pervasive
[25:56] influence
[25:57] that if you if you let Levin do its job
[26:00] it's going to change the whole lump
[26:02] that there's no place for leaven
[26:04] and I know this again this may be uh
[26:06] kind of tighten it up quite a bit and
[26:08] say well there's no room for being wrong
[26:09] there's no room for uh for air well we
[26:12] shouldn't make a place for it
[26:15] all right we shouldn't make a place for
[26:16] it and say well at least I believe half
[26:18] of it or at least I uh um you know I
[26:20] don't I don't mind eating a pie that's
[26:22] full of seeds as long as I could just
[26:23] taste the Cherry a little bit and just
[26:25] keep chucking out seeds all the time all
[26:27] right you don't want to make room for it
[26:29] know that if it's there God is still
[26:32] correcting God is washing have Grace for
[26:34] yourself have Grace for other people
[26:35] know that we're all striving shoulder to
[26:38] shoulder again not Toe to Toe not uh
[26:40] fighting eye to eye but we're walking
[26:42] shoulder to shoulder and we're and we're
[26:45] striving for truth and so there's times
[26:47] when maybe we see one thing here we see
[26:49] one thing there and it may be in a sense
[26:51] we could say this that maybe there's a
[26:54] little bit of a pendulum swing for some
[26:55] and maybe for all of us or at times we
[26:58] swing way out here maybe we swing out
[27:00] there but as time goes on hopefully what
[27:02] we're doing is we're coming right to the
[27:03] middle of the road and we might be on
[27:06] different cadences and different rhythms
[27:07] but if we'll all just stay in tune to
[27:09] the conductor eventually we'll all just
[27:11] get just right maybe we're just all
[27:14] those instruments warming not before the
[27:15] great finale for The Great Final Act and
[27:18] we might seem like we're out of tune and
[27:20] there may be a little bit of a pendulum
[27:21] swing but just stay in the word of God
[27:23] it'll harmonize eventually we'll get in
[27:25] tune and so if there's a if there's some
[27:27] something that doesn't seem right we
[27:29] want God to correct it because we don't
[27:31] want air to have a seat at the table
[27:36] because A little leaven will eleven the
[27:38] whole lump and it's a hindrance and so
[27:40] when Paul says you ran well what
[27:42] hindered you well it was a persuasion it
[27:44] was some teaching it was some idea that
[27:46] got in their minds that hindered them
[27:48] from fully obeying the truth and so the
[27:50] wrong understanding can hinder the truth
[27:53] in our lives
[27:55] and I don't mind putting on our
[27:57] understanding because there's times when
[27:59] uh and I don't believe I put the scripts
[28:01] the statements in here tonight I was
[28:04] really running out of time
[28:06] in in trying to uh narrow this down for
[28:09] this evening but there's times when the
[28:12] right teaching can be misunderstood
[28:14] right it's times that it happens and
[28:17] that's when from the point of here in
[28:19] our head to our heart it's the longest
[28:21] distance traveled for a man is for
[28:23] something to drop from the head to the
[28:25] heart and sometimes it enters into our
[28:26] head and in letting it just come right
[28:28] through the channel down into the heart
[28:29] there's other things that begin to
[28:30] attach itself to it and once it does
[28:33] that it can't fit in the channel
[28:35] because there's all sorts of baggage
[28:36] that that's clinging on to it and that's
[28:39] where correct teaching uh can be
[28:42] misunderstood but then there's also
[28:43] times when there's incorrect teaching
[28:46] and don't ever beat yourself up if you
[28:49] can't understand incorrect teaching
[28:51] that's a good thing I was told one time
[28:53] uh someone preached on the godhead and a
[28:56] sister came out of church and she said
[28:57] well now I don't know if there's five or
[28:59] six Gods but that was really deep and I
[29:01] liked it
[29:03] and I thought no that's not it
[29:06] and so there's times maybe we try to
[29:08] understand something and if we can't
[29:10] again if you don't understand you don't
[29:11] have to tear it down but remember if
[29:13] it's air ultimately you probably can't
[29:14] understand it
[29:16] and just be careful there and I know
[29:18] that there's that's not that's not
[29:20] competing with the idea of tearing
[29:21] things down things we don't understand
[29:23] if you don't understand it leave it
[29:24] alone
[29:25] right if there's a question leave it
[29:26] alone brother Brown says and let's not
[29:28] try to wrap our heads around it
[29:29] necessarily but just trust God to give
[29:31] us insight to give us understanding
[29:34] brother random makes this statement in
[29:35] the unpardonable sin he says think of it
[29:37] no fear the greatest plague there is in
[29:40] the Christian church today is afraid
[29:43] and the reason they're afraid is because
[29:45] they're taught they're not taught right
[29:47] and settled right on the gospel what's
[29:50] the reason for fear the wrong teaching
[29:53] the reason they're afraid is because
[29:54] they are not taught right and since
[29:56] they're not taught right they're not
[29:57] settled right
[29:59] on the gospel
[30:01] so if the gospel can be taught right
[30:02] it's what settles the people brother
[30:04] myself oh I love teaching it gives the
[30:06] basis and settles the church so the
[30:08] reason why there's fear again make this
[30:10] personal our fear can be tied to some
[30:13] misunderstanding of what is taught or
[30:16] adhering to and trying to figure out
[30:19] something that's not right
[30:22] fear is it comes from the reason why
[30:24] people are afraid because they're not
[30:25] taught right and settled right on the
[30:27] gospel now this is again we want you to
[30:30] make this personal
[30:32] the wrong kind of teaching the worst way
[30:34] the wrong the error the wrong kind of
[30:37] teaching or balance and teaching the
[30:38] worst thing it does is it makes us
[30:39] reluctant as Christians
[30:41] we're reluctant to believe we're
[30:44] reluctant to take God at his word we
[30:47] want to believe it because as we see it
[30:48] in the word we want to enjoy it or we
[30:50] want to have a good attitude towards it
[30:51] and you know how you hate that feeling
[30:53] of resentment
[30:54] and you hate that feeling of
[30:56] um I'll never forget when brother Biscoe
[30:58] was preaching and the way he described
[31:00] he says you know when you just get that
[31:01] I was like yes I know that I know what
[31:05] if that's exactly what is you just feel
[31:06] that little in your spirit and I don't
[31:08] like that feeling
[31:10] and there's times we might have that and
[31:12] it's because of human emotion
[31:15] uh perception and opinion and past
[31:17] experiences and you start to resent
[31:19] something you start to get bitter
[31:21] towards something and to resent
[31:22] something and get bitter towards it
[31:24] that's not the spirit of Christ
[31:26] to recognize something as evil to
[31:28] recognize something is wrong I recognize
[31:29] something as Unholy or unrighteous
[31:31] that's a pleasing feeling that's a
[31:33] embolding feeling that's something
[31:35] that's very clean and so what happens
[31:37] when we're when we're feeding on the
[31:39] wrong things and entertaining the wrong
[31:40] things it's starting to build that
[31:42] complex in our hearts and build
[31:44] something in our minds and we begin to
[31:45] feel this sense of wow I feel uneasy and
[31:48] when we begin to get reluctant to take
[31:50] God at God at his word there's some
[31:52] leaven in there somewhere
[31:55] the devil wants us to do is maybe not
[31:57] outright reject something but hesitate
[31:59] to believe it
[32:01] just hesitate just to make us reluctant
[32:03] and that's through fear now in Ephesians
[32:06] chapter 1 verses verse 13 just read this
[32:09] one verse this will have a dual purpose
[32:11] because he's talking about the Seal of
[32:13] God but he's also talking about the
[32:14] process of God speaking of Christ in
[32:16] whom ye also trusted how did we come to
[32:19] trust in Christ after that ye heard the
[32:22] word of Truth so trust it speaks of hope
[32:24] you hear the word of God and it gives
[32:26] you an expectation and having this
[32:28] expectation it gives you faith in whom
[32:30] you trusted after that you heard the
[32:32] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[32:34] salvation
[32:35] in whom also after that you believe so
[32:37] hear that you hear the word it gives you
[32:39] expectation it produces Faith because
[32:41] it's not just trust and hearing but it
[32:44] also brings Faith because after you
[32:45] believed you believed after hearing the
[32:48] word
[32:49] and it says after that you were sealed
[32:51] with that Holy Spirit of promise
[32:53] so there is a seal of God after you
[32:55] believe you hear the word it gives you
[32:57] an expectation God's fulfills his word
[33:00] you see God confirming his word god
[33:02] deals with your heart it gives you faith
[33:04] and then the Seal of God is a seal of
[33:06] your faith it is a definite experience
[33:07] of the Baptist holy ghost that comes
[33:09] upon the believer who believes God's
[33:11] word God's word and you're sealed with
[33:14] that Holy Spirit of promise
[33:15] but if you the wrong view now will put
[33:19] the promises of God Out Of Reach
[33:21] because you have to hear the word of
[33:23] Truth and it's the word of truth that
[33:24] creates the right kind of expectation
[33:26] God in meeting those expectations brings
[33:29] forth faith and it's your faith that God
[33:31] seals now that's in the context of
[33:33] receiving the Seal of God but virtually
[33:34] every other promise of God could fit
[33:36] into that Paradigm where you hear it
[33:39] preach and it brings an expectation of
[33:41] it and then when God satisfies it or
[33:43] meets it it builds more faith
[33:46] and that's how it ought to work
[33:50] that's how God's word is made to work
[33:54] but then again the wrong perception will
[33:57] cause us to hesitate will inhibit our
[33:59] reach we're not expecting we're not
[34:01] hoping you heard the word of Truth and
[34:04] then after you heard it you trusted in
[34:05] Christ and you believed and that's
[34:08] because the word is drawing you to reach
[34:10] forward the word is causing you to
[34:12] Endeavor forward it's something that's
[34:14] promoting uh releasing you from bondage
[34:16] you're no longer Tied by Traditions
[34:18] you're no longer held back by things
[34:20] that hinder you and if you don't have
[34:22] the right thing preached if you're not
[34:24] hearing the right things what does it
[34:26] cause you to do it keeps these things
[34:28] out of your reach
[34:29] now I'll go so far as to say it's not
[34:32] necessarily listen to the wrong things
[34:33] it's not taking time to listen to the
[34:35] right thing
[34:37] now you don't have to be out there just
[34:38] trying to find all the latest false
[34:40] prophets and I'm going to buy their
[34:41] books and stream their services and fill
[34:43] myself up on blood moon part 1006 uh but
[34:47] you're but you could just be listen all
[34:48] the other things in the world
[34:50] and and by feeding on all these things
[34:52] in the world it's not promoting faith
[34:56] now brother bam touches on this in the
[34:58] context of Divine Healing he says as
[35:01] soon as you repent of your sins if God's
[35:04] truly convicted you and you've repented
[35:05] and been baptized in Jesus name God's
[35:08] under obligation to give you the Holy
[35:10] Spirit right now right then I may want
[35:12] to come back and visit this because it's
[35:13] really important to recognize the the
[35:17] what God the process of the new birth he
[35:20] says if you've been convict if you've
[35:22] repented of your sins by a true
[35:23] conviction and been baptized in Jesus
[35:26] Christ's name God's under obligation to
[35:28] give you the Holy Spirit right now right
[35:30] then one of the quotes I took out I
[35:32] don't believe it's in there he says you
[35:33] you say you've been seeking the Holy
[35:35] Ghost for years and he says I'm not
[35:37] scolding you
[35:39] but you either mistought something's
[35:41] wrong somewhere you don't understand
[35:43] because he teaches us very plainly
[35:45] there's no tarrying Services there's no
[35:48] uh there's no point of trying to wait
[35:49] for a special time it's according to
[35:52] your faith in God's word
[35:55] that's right because his word said so
[35:57] it's nothing on God's part it's your
[36:00] part because people have been mistaught
[36:03] God's under obligation once there's a
[36:05] true conviction and repentance and a
[36:07] baptism in Jesus name to give you the
[36:09] Holy Ghost but if the wrong kind of
[36:11] understanding has you under the
[36:13] expectation of something else you can
[36:15] actually be hindering the progress of
[36:17] that experience we even heard about it
[36:19] with brother Matthew over these last two
[36:21] Services I thought they're absolutely
[36:23] tremendous and worthy of going back and
[36:26] listening to if you haven't heard them
[36:27] or even maybe revisit them yourself if
[36:29] you were here but he mentioned how that
[36:31] one sister the way she was nature and
[36:33] the way she was bent she had the Holy
[36:36] Ghost but because of her nature and her
[36:37] past she was not going forward because
[36:40] she kept getting hung up on speaking in
[36:42] tongues so brother Brown said I'm just
[36:44] going to pray that God let you know it
[36:46] and so it shows that process and that
[36:48] development that can take place within
[36:49] our faith
[36:50] and adoption the adoption series part
[36:53] one brother Banner says Bible teaching
[36:54] is usually a little treacherous a little
[36:56] you know kind of walking out on thin ice
[36:58] we call it that's why you want to be
[37:00] very careful when you teach
[37:02] I believe that is why God made a
[37:03] division amongst the gifts that you have
[37:05] some evangelists you have pastors you
[37:07] have Apostles you have you have the
[37:09] different gifts and then you have a
[37:11] teacher there's a gift of teaching and I
[37:14] believe the holy spirit is the teacher
[37:16] but I believe a man of God who has a
[37:17] true teaching gift is to be prized and
[37:19] to be valued and and so this is
[37:23] something that when there when it comes
[37:24] to teaching to be very deliberate a very
[37:27] patient and not just treat it like
[37:29] inspiration because Brevard says you're
[37:31] walking out on thin ice maybe he says
[37:33] but we just feel that maybe at this
[37:35] point at this time it might be good to
[37:37] kind of bring the church to what I think
[37:39] to a complete understanding positionally
[37:42] of what we are in Christ Jesus
[37:45] so sometimes I think that preaching is a
[37:47] wonderful thing but I believe sometimes
[37:49] brother Beeler that teaching goes beyond
[37:52] that kind of an interesting call out to
[37:54] brother Beeler I don't know if he was
[37:56] kind of needling him a little bit but
[37:58] anybody know brother Beeler maybe we
[38:00] find what the inside joke was he says I
[38:03] sometimes think that preaching is a
[38:04] wonderful thing but I believe sometimes
[38:06] brother that teaching goals beyond what
[38:09] the wonderful thing of preaching he says
[38:11] sometimes I think preach is a wonderful
[38:12] thing I would suspect that he's saying
[38:14] preaching is always a wonderful thing
[38:16] but there's teaching that sometimes goes
[38:18] beyond that
[38:19] he says it kindly especially to the
[38:21] church he says preaching usually catches
[38:23] The Sinner brings him under condemnation
[38:25] by the word but teaching places a man
[38:28] positionally what he is
[38:31] and he makes this profound statement and
[38:32] we can never rightly be able to have
[38:34] faith until positionally we know what we
[38:35] are
[38:37] so we want to rightly be able to have
[38:38] faith we can have faith but then Faith
[38:40] being positionally placed blossoms our
[38:42] faith uninhibits our faith loosens our
[38:45] faith unbridles our faith and he's
[38:47] saying that preaching catches The Sinner
[38:49] preaching it vitalizes our faith and it
[38:52] gives us expectation and hope and after
[38:54] we have believed on him we're sealed
[38:56] with the Holy Spirit a promise that's
[38:57] what preaching does is it catches The
[38:59] Sinner to come to a true conviction to
[39:01] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[39:03] and then we are sealed because of God's
[39:05] obligated to meet us on that condition
[39:07] with the right understanding to be
[39:09] sealed with the baptism of the Holy
[39:10] Ghost and that's a faith that we receive
[39:12] by the preach of the word and brother
[39:14] Graham says then sometimes teaching goes
[39:16] beyond that to positionally place that
[39:18] man what he is
[39:19] and we want to rightly be able to have
[39:21] faith and that comes through this
[39:22] teaching he's saying to positionally
[39:24] understand who we are
[39:26] the Brandman that godhead explains is
[39:27] you've got to believe you've got to have
[39:29] faith you've got to have confidence
[39:31] and how can you have confidence in
[39:33] anything that you don't even know where
[39:34] you are going
[39:36] how could I travel down a road that I've
[39:37] never been before at Breakneck speed and
[39:39] all around curves not knowing what the
[39:41] next curve holds
[39:42] so it happens a lot of people driving
[39:44] out there in some of the Hill Country
[39:45] and the Ozarks and the mountains they're
[39:47] just they're tearing through there and
[39:49] they think they know where they're going
[39:50] they think where the turn is and they
[39:51] lose control
[39:53] he says you've got to see where you're
[39:54] going or you don't know how to walk
[39:58] it's part of that confidence placing
[40:01] positioning you got to know where you're
[40:02] going you got to know where to place
[40:04] your feet
[40:05] you wonder why you find disappointments
[40:08] because you're listening to some promise
[40:10] if you step there God will meet you
[40:12] there but there's no word to step there
[40:13] and you end up falling and you want to
[40:15] get up and shake your fistic God
[40:17] right
[40:19] but if there's nothing there to step on
[40:21] that can't be Faith that's leading you
[40:24] you have to have confidence in what
[40:26] you're doing he says
[40:28] this quote has been featured prominently
[40:30] in our services here since the start of
[40:32] this church and images of Christ he says
[40:34] the church can never progress until it
[40:36] knows what grounds it what grounds it is
[40:39] progressing on
[40:40] we can't Pro make progress unless we
[40:42] know the way to progress we know the
[40:44] path that we're traversing and I believe
[40:46] that before anybody can ever move or
[40:48] have real confidential Faith it's first
[40:50] they have to know where they stand and
[40:52] how to stand after they make their stand
[40:55] I believe that is essential for you
[40:58] cannot just head long plunge into
[41:00] something with faith when you don't know
[41:02] where you're plunging
[41:03] remember the subject of Blind Faith some
[41:06] people think that faith is Flying Blind
[41:08] but in reality faith is a sense
[41:12] so you're not Blind Faith sees something
[41:15] Faith knows something Faith sees the
[41:17] evidence and it doesn't say well I'm
[41:19] just going to parachute out and just
[41:20] trust that God will catch me
[41:22] no it jumps knowing there's provision it
[41:24] jumps knowing there's a promise right
[41:26] head plunges into something knowing God
[41:29] has made the promise
[41:31] and that's what gives us real
[41:32] confidential faith is because we know
[41:34] what grounds we're progressing on and
[41:36] then this beautiful statement and if our
[41:37] faith he says you've got to know and if
[41:39] our faith is set right and in the right
[41:41] position it gives a constant
[41:43] satisfaction
[41:45] where does Fear come from
[41:46] misunderstanding where does happiness
[41:49] and joy and peace come from
[41:50] understanding
[41:52] why is it we can feel unsettled and
[41:54] restless and feel compromised because
[41:56] there's a lack of understanding now
[41:58] again I want you to make it personal
[42:00] because you think oh well that that's
[42:01] false teaching or it's this or it's that
[42:04] or maybe I don't have faith and maybe I
[42:05] don't believe no I'm not trying to I'm
[42:07] not trying to make you question your
[42:09] faith I want you to place your faith
[42:11] trying to devalue it belittle it make it
[42:14] seem like something you don't have but
[42:15] it's just taking what you do have and
[42:17] placing it correctly brother when he
[42:19] says teaching places the man where he
[42:21] ought to be so let's say teaching
[42:23] exposes you all as a bunch of frauds
[42:25] right that's not what teaching does
[42:27] teaching it is not about exposing frauds
[42:29] teaching about taking those who are part
[42:32] of that body part of the part of the
[42:34] pyramid taking those stones and
[42:36] positionally placing them where they
[42:37] belong and giving them confidence about
[42:39] who they are and what God made them in
[42:41] their part in God's economy and where
[42:43] they belong in God's Kingdom
[42:47] and if our faith can be set right and in
[42:49] the right position it gives us that
[42:52] steadiness and that constant
[42:53] satisfaction
[42:55] trust you you're catching the theme Here
[42:58] as we want to preach on Christ my healer
[43:00] we're teaching on Christ given a basis
[43:02] for faith
[43:04] and we're wanting the faith to grow and
[43:06] there's things that preach that catch
[43:08] our attention that startle us cause us
[43:10] to believe and then there's an
[43:12] understanding of the word of God that's
[43:13] going to enrich and going to make that
[43:15] faith and cause it to mature
[43:18] there's a and think about it it works
[43:20] hand in hand
[43:21] there's not uh this is not
[43:24] a uh this is not a rap battle between
[43:27] evangelists and teachers
[43:28] right where one's got to outdo the other
[43:31] and one's better than the other and what
[43:32] we need is more of this and what we need
[43:34] is more of that we need them all to be
[43:35] working together
[43:37] we need all these parts working together
[43:38] doing our part honoring each part giving
[43:40] honor to each each member knowing that
[43:43] we this church serves the true church
[43:44] and as any minister of this church
[43:46] therefore we serve the purpose of Christ
[43:48] and not our own purposes not our own
[43:50] Ministries but we desire to see
[43:51] individuals brought up in the nurture of
[43:54] God to come to understand the word of
[43:56] God and to know him
[43:57] and so it's the work of the holy spirit
[43:59] in the church that's the spirit of God
[44:01] teacheth these things reveals these
[44:03] things makes these things known to us
[44:05] Jesus in John Chapter 14 verse 26 but
[44:08] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[44:10] that's the teacher the inside teacher
[44:12] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[44:13] whom the father will send in my name he
[44:15] shall teach you all things and bring all
[44:18] things to remembrance whatsoever I have
[44:20] said unto you
[44:21] to bring to remembrance is to it's to
[44:23] cause you to be mindful of
[44:25] and and that is what teaching is to do
[44:28] is to to is to promote the things that
[44:30] can be understood to cause you to be
[44:32] mindful of them to allow them to be
[44:34] established and to become permanent and
[44:36] fixed into our thinking
[44:39] the Holy Ghost will teach you all things
[44:41] bring all things to your remembrance the
[44:44] things that Christ has taught
[44:47] the things relating to Christ it says in
[44:50] John 16 13 how be it when the spirit of
[44:52] Truth has come he will guide you into
[44:54] all truth
[44:56] so if there's a spirit that's only
[44:58] leading you so far
[45:00] if there's a spirit that's adding to or
[45:02] taken away and trying to change truth
[45:04] that's a point to stop and say what kind
[45:06] of spirit is this because the spirit of
[45:08] God is going to guide us into all truth
[45:11] brother Bama in the sermon here ye him
[45:13] says for when God brought us into his
[45:14] kingdom by the Baptist Holy Spirit and
[45:16] become a child of God notice this these
[45:18] hear ye him we're dealing with the
[45:20] process of God developing of character
[45:22] development of the Son of God into the
[45:24] image of Christ he says we became a
[45:25] child of God and sent us the best tutor
[45:28] God sent us the best tutor that there
[45:30] was in all Heaven the Holy Spirit
[45:32] he is to nurture and to bring up and to
[45:35] raise and to teach the church
[45:38] if you have the Holy Spirit then let it
[45:40] do its job unbrother your faith and let
[45:42] the inside teacher teach you nurture you
[45:45] bring you up raise you he says brother
[45:47] we need Holy Spirit teaching and
[45:49] tutoring
[45:51] it's part of the development of our
[45:52] character kind of the part of the
[45:54] perfecting of the person it is part of
[45:56] building rapturing faith in the bride
[46:00] that's the comforter that's the role of
[46:02] the Holy Ghost who is the teacher
[46:04] the spirit of Truth
[46:06] and the spirit of truth comes to us that
[46:08] they open to the word
[46:09] this is that this is the day now the
[46:11] perfect fulfillment of many scriptures a
[46:13] shining light shining more and more into
[46:14] the perfect day this is the time of
[46:16] understanding the time of revealing
[46:20] in Romans chapter 12 verse 2 and again I
[46:22] might seem like it seems like I'm just
[46:25] dumping a puzzle out under the table and
[46:26] just
[46:27] moving pieces around that's exactly what
[46:29] I'm doing I'm just trying to put the
[46:31] puzzle pieces on the table turn them all
[46:33] over right side up you can start putting
[46:34] them together start putting the Border
[46:36] together if we don't have time to do
[46:37] anything else tonight we're just trying
[46:39] to get the pieces on the table
[46:41] so the scene if this seems disjointed to
[46:43] me it I I look I can see the picture and
[46:45] see how it fits in
[46:47] maybe that's what I need to do is show
[46:48] you the picture before we dump all the
[46:50] pieces out
[46:52] if we could only do that in Romans
[46:54] chapter 12 verse 2 and be not conformed
[46:56] to this world so there is a power of the
[46:58] world to try to contort us distort us
[47:00] conform us pervert the growth of the
[47:02] development of the life in us he says be
[47:04] not conformed because that's what's
[47:05] temporary
[47:07] that's not durable it's not long lasting
[47:09] so you're it's actually in the sense
[47:11] that this can only apply to a believer
[47:14] in the sense that your life which is
[47:16] tending to something else is being
[47:17] manipulated or formed to fit something
[47:19] else that it doesn't belong to
[47:21] and be not conformed to this world but
[47:23] be transformed by the renewing of your
[47:25] mind that ye may prove what is that good
[47:27] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[47:31] be transformed that means to change from
[47:33] one form into another
[47:35] to transfigure
[47:37] I says this transformation is going to
[47:39] take place by the renewing of your mind
[47:41] this is the renovation
[47:42] this is a change for the better complete
[47:45] change for the better the word means to
[47:47] cause to grow up
[47:49] we're not just children impersonating
[47:52] adults we're not just 12 going on 21 but
[47:55] we're in the process of being developed
[47:56] to where we cause to grow up in such a
[47:59] way that the person is made completely
[48:01] new
[48:02] that's what we're to be in the process
[48:04] of transformed by the renewing of our
[48:07] mind the holy spirit of God which is the
[48:09] inside teacher guiding us into all truth
[48:11] bringing all things to our remembrance
[48:13] stirring our minds up causing us to keep
[48:16] in mind the precepts of God and the
[48:18] teachings of God
[48:19] I know you're familiar with this
[48:21] statement we're just wine coming around
[48:22] to our clothes
[48:24] and the message power of transformation
[48:25] brother says now that we've been saved
[48:27] as we are
[48:29] and that we've been filled to the Holy
[48:31] Spirit as we have so that notice this
[48:33] their salvation
[48:35] and it's not just believing or a
[48:38] confession but he's bringing us to this
[48:40] idea this truth of being sealed with the
[48:42] Holy Ghost so if once we've been sealed
[48:44] he says as we have and I believe that
[48:47] it's to understand what he's going to
[48:49] say next now we want the mind that was
[48:51] in Christ to be in US
[48:53] that we might be transformed from the
[48:56] Natural Things of life and be brought in
[48:59] to do the perfect will of God by
[49:01] transformation of God's spirit by his
[49:03] word
[49:04] so the transformation is going to be by
[49:06] his word and now that we've been saved
[49:08] and filled with the Holy Ghost what that
[49:10] the stage that you enter into once you
[49:12] are still to Holy Ghost is the process
[49:14] of letting the mind of Christ be a
[49:16] perfect Liberty in you because if his
[49:19] mind can be liberated in you if your
[49:21] faith can be unbridled then you will be
[49:24] transformed from the Natural Things of
[49:26] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[49:28] will of God
[49:31] that's what it's going to take is by his
[49:33] word once you've received the Holy Ghost
[49:35] I can make back up it's by his word that
[49:37] you're going to believe it's by his
[49:39] words you're going to be silent the Holy
[49:40] Ghost and then the process of
[49:42] development continues in the believer
[49:44] that now that I've been born again by
[49:46] the Holy Ghost and its new life is
[49:47] dwelled inside my soul I want the mind
[49:50] of Christ to be fully developed in me
[49:52] because as he has preeminence then I am
[49:55] going to be totally transformed as a
[49:58] person from natural things to spiritual
[50:00] things from worldly things to
[50:02] Supernatural things so that I can do do
[50:05] do the perfect will of God
[50:08] and in doing so be the proof of his word
[50:11] to prove the perfect will of God
[50:15] and so when this foundational part on
[50:17] Christ is my healer I'm wanting to take
[50:19] the time as God would lead to teach the
[50:22] right things to unbridle our faith
[50:27] I believe that this message is the
[50:29] restoration of faith
[50:31] that's a restorative message and there's
[50:33] things that we could look at to see I'll
[50:35] just maybe drop this in here there's
[50:36] things that brother Brown when he's come
[50:38] into his ministry even early on in his
[50:40] ministry and he begins with the signs
[50:42] and wonders and Divine Healing
[50:43] and there's things that he's having to
[50:45] establish as a messenger to the seventh
[50:47] Church age
[50:48] there's a necessary restoration of
[50:51] things that the Pentecostal the genuine
[50:53] Pentecostal move begin to let loose of
[50:55] and begin to defile so his ministry is
[50:57] working in restoring certain precepts
[51:00] upon which God desired the Capstone to
[51:03] settle
[51:04] and that's part of his ministry but we
[51:06] know that wasn't all his ministry
[51:08] but these things all work together
[51:11] man sometimes you hear people kicking
[51:13] against something and they kick so hard
[51:14] against it they don't realize they're
[51:15] knocking their Foundation right out from
[51:17] underneath them
[51:19] so this it's to promote the faith that
[51:21] God has given us there's faith that
[51:23] we've received
[51:24] now I this in Acts chapter 19 verses one
[51:27] to seven
[51:29] this is I want to use this as an example
[51:32] now
[51:36] not as a perfect template of what I'm
[51:38] referring to but an example of how
[51:41] the right kind of teaching
[51:44] brings people further
[51:46] and so it's not a rebuke oh you don't
[51:48] believe you believe this you believe
[51:49] that it's not it's not trying to tear
[51:51] down everything and make somebody feel
[51:52] like they're nothing but it's the
[51:54] process of God to bring people to
[51:56] the journey
[51:58] right the way that God makes himself
[52:00] known
[52:01] there's a reason why we all weren't born
[52:02] speaking in tongues at you know at day
[52:04] one as babies I guess we were speaking
[52:07] in tongues in some ways but it's not
[52:09] that we all come through the same
[52:10] pattern but people come through
[52:11] processes sometimes people spend many
[52:13] years in false doctrines or
[52:16] denominations and we could just write it
[52:18] all off as a huge waste but God's a
[52:19] redeemer
[52:21] God will use all of it he redeems all of
[52:23] it God has a purpose and God's
[52:24] orchestrating things we always want to
[52:26] keep the right attitude towards one
[52:27] another and the things of God in Acts
[52:30] chapter 19 verses 1 to 7 and it came to
[52:32] pass that while Apollos was at Corinth
[52:34] Paul having passed through the upper
[52:36] Coast came to Ephesus in finding certain
[52:38] disciples now I believe it's intentional
[52:41] that they name drop Apollos because
[52:43] Apollos in Acts chapter 18 verses 24 and
[52:46] 25 we're told that he was in Ephesus
[52:48] teaching what only the baptism of John
[52:51] so John was Apollos was in Ephesus
[52:55] teaching to be baptized according to
[52:57] John's baptism so Paul visits Ephesus
[53:00] finding people who listen to Apollos a
[53:02] man who's a powerful powerful teacher
[53:04] and came into further knowledge of the
[53:06] truth later he said unto him have you
[53:08] received the Holy Ghost since you
[53:10] believed
[53:11] so Paul is coming upon believers
[53:14] he doesn't say have you received the
[53:16] Holy Ghost I'm trying to find out if
[53:18] you're Believers he says he's
[53:19] acknowledging their belief in their
[53:20] faith he says but have you received the
[53:22] whole to go since you believed and they
[53:24] said I mean we have not so much as heard
[53:27] whether there be any Holy Ghost so think
[53:30] of this they had believed what they
[53:32] heard
[53:33] and what they had not heard they could
[53:35] not believe
[53:36] so they were Believers of what they
[53:38] heard all they need to hear is further
[53:41] truth and since they are by nature and
[53:43] by election Believers they'll believe
[53:46] truth when they hear it
[53:49] so we have not so much as heard whether
[53:50] there be any Holy Ghost
[53:52] what then were you baptized so again
[53:54] there's this understanding that there's
[53:56] this process of unfolding of the word of
[53:58] God there's an evolution of Faith
[54:00] there's an unfolding of the Mysteries
[54:01] even there's a there's an unfolding of
[54:04] Revelation
[54:06] and sorry he's not trying to say oh
[54:08] you've been nowhere you've done nothing
[54:09] it's just giving us this discernment
[54:11] you're Believers so have you received
[54:13] the Holy Ghost we haven't heard of the
[54:15] Holy Ghost so he says then how were you
[54:17] baptized they said under John's baptism
[54:21] so now he knows what they're believing
[54:23] where are they at he knows where to meet
[54:24] him to take them further and his then
[54:26] said Paul John barely baptized with the
[54:29] baptism of repentance saying unto the
[54:31] people that they should believe on him
[54:33] which should come after him that is on
[54:36] Christ Jesus
[54:37] when they heard this
[54:40] they were baptized in the name of Lord
[54:42] Jesus Christ
[54:43] when they heard that they didn't meet
[54:46] Paul shake his hand and say what's
[54:47] next what should we do should get
[54:48] baptized no he had to take them from
[54:51] where they were
[54:53] they had faith in what they had heard
[54:55] but now Paul took that faith that they
[54:57] had and placed it in the present truth
[55:00] you are a Believer have you received the
[55:02] Holy Ghost since you believed we haven't
[55:04] even heard of the Holy Ghost then how
[55:05] were you baptized well then let me show
[55:07] you what that baptism was pointing to
[55:09] let me show you what that Faith was
[55:11] given for it was Faith to believe in the
[55:14] promise it was Faith to believe in the
[55:16] coming of Christ it was Faith to believe
[55:18] that which was coming after the
[55:21] Forerunner
[55:23] and so he's took the faith that they had
[55:26] and you say oh you guys are just a bunch
[55:28] of Pentecostal wannabes you guys are
[55:29] just a bunch of this that and the other
[55:31] no he just took the faith they had and
[55:32] placed it
[55:35] brother says and where I think Pentecost
[55:37] failed he says now we've tried to jump
[55:38] the fence
[55:40] we've tried to stick the cart before the
[55:42] horse
[55:43] you tried to claim things and do things
[55:45] before God did it and got a lot of Flesh
[55:47] worked up into it
[55:49] and that's what's the matter with the
[55:51] church
[55:52] if real Pentecostal Faith settled over
[55:54] an audience of this size brother all of
[55:56] California would know something that
[55:57] happened up here tonight that's right he
[56:00] says there's something wrong now please
[56:02] catch this he said there's something
[56:03] wrong it isn't wrong with God
[56:05] it isn't wrong with your faith
[56:10] nothing wrong with God
[56:11] he says it isn't wrong with your faith
[56:13] it's being placed right knowing what
[56:15] you're doing and how to do it that's the
[56:18] secret of the whole thing then yielding
[56:21] yourself to the will of God
[56:23] that's the secret of the whole thing is
[56:26] that knowing having your faith placed
[56:28] right and then when your faith is placed
[56:30] right then you know what to do as he
[56:32] said to be brought in to do the perfect
[56:34] will of God then you yield yourself to
[56:37] the will of God
[56:40] I love that it isn't wrong with your
[56:41] faith you say well those people at
[56:43] Ephesus had had the wrong kind of Faith
[56:46] No they had Faith but it was only placed
[56:48] in part of the promise
[56:50] and when they heard the further unfold
[56:52] in the word that Faith could easily then
[56:54] now grow and take possession
[56:57] in the further light
[56:59] opened up new land for their faith to
[57:01] inhabit new land for their feet to step
[57:03] on into and to take possession of
[57:07] so it's not something wrong with your
[57:08] faith if you're not experiencing the
[57:10] benefits of God's word if there's
[57:12] something that's not unfolding for you
[57:13] let's not try to take that year well I
[57:15] don't have faith I have the wrong Faith
[57:17] let's just ask God to take our faith and
[57:18] place it right
[57:21] to positionally place it
[57:24] that's the secret of the whole thing and
[57:27] then yielding yourself to the will of
[57:30] God
[57:33] in Colossians chapter 1 9 Colossus
[57:35] chapter 1 verse nine these are my
[57:37] closing scriptures
[57:40] Paul in his prayer for the church he
[57:41] says for this cause we also since the
[57:43] day we heard it do not cease to pray for
[57:45] you
[57:45] and to desire his unceasing prayer in
[57:48] his desired and to desire that ye might
[57:50] be filled
[57:52] with the knowledge of his will
[57:55] in all wisdom and spiritual
[57:57] understanding
[57:59] hey if we're being restored back to what
[58:01] Paul taught
[58:02] this is what we teach
[58:04] right if this is part of what's uh what
[58:07] it was taught then he there's a desire
[58:09] to be filled with the knowledge of his
[58:11] will in all wisdom and spiritual
[58:14] understanding
[58:15] there's nothing wrong with your faith
[58:17] it's being placed right knowing what
[58:18] you're doing and how to do it that's the
[58:20] secret of the whole thing and then
[58:21] yielding yourself to the will of God
[58:22] then we want God to take the word of God
[58:25] and open it up to us that we might be
[58:27] filled with the knowledge of his will in
[58:29] all wisdom and spiritual understanding
[58:31] so that we can yield ourselves to the
[58:33] will of God
[58:35] and Paul the very one that's right in
[58:37] this was told by ananias in Acts chapter
[58:39] 22 the god of our fathers have chosen
[58:41] thee that thou shouldest know his will
[58:44] and see that just one and should us hear
[58:47] the voice of his mouth
[58:49] and so Paul just wasn't keeping it to
[58:51] himself
[58:52] saying well I've been chosen that I
[58:54] should know his will and see the just
[58:55] one and should hear the voice of his
[58:57] mouth his desire for the Colossians is
[58:59] that they might be filled with the
[59:00] knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
[59:03] spiritual understanding
[59:08] these things are very important the word
[59:09] is very precious to us we're familiar
[59:12] with brother man says I wonder if we're
[59:13] sufficiently impressed with the word
[59:14] that's in our midst
[59:16] implying we can be impressed right maybe
[59:19] all of us here tonight it's a Wednesday
[59:20] night we're impressed obviously but is
[59:23] it sufficient
[59:25] sufficiency speaks to meeting the
[59:27] purpose or the objective are you
[59:28] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[59:30] our midst maybe a lot of us are
[59:31] impressed
[59:33] we've been impressed we've been
[59:34] impressed and we're just impressed but
[59:35] the word must sufficiently impress us
[59:38] we have to Value it
[59:42] I want to read a lengthy statement from
[59:44] voice of the sign we're just closing on
[59:45] this so we'll invite the musicians to
[59:47] come
[59:48] brother Ram's actually praying so maybe
[59:50] you could just pray in your hearts now
[59:52] and just Ponder these things that we've
[59:53] shared with you
[59:55] he says our heavenly father we have
[59:56] deemed this such a privilege to come to
[59:58] you in prayer
[1:00:00] come in the name Lord Jesus is at the
[1:00:02] very beginning of this sermon the voice
[1:00:03] of the sign
[1:00:04] and we are promised by him that if we
[1:00:06] ask anything in his name it will be
[1:00:08] granted
[1:00:09] thou knowest the need of every one of us
[1:00:13] you know what our hands represented as
[1:00:16] they went up that's why we say it's not
[1:00:17] a fruitless exercise to raise our hands
[1:00:19] he says I pray father that you'll answer
[1:00:23] each request tonight
[1:00:26] get Glory
[1:00:28] and now let the great teacher of the
[1:00:30] word the Holy Spirit come upon us
[1:00:32] tonight and reveal himself to us and
[1:00:35] make himself known unto us by the
[1:00:37] evidence of his resurrection may he come
[1:00:40] among us tonight Lord and visit our
[1:00:42] hearts
[1:00:43] this is this is poetry it's beautiful
[1:00:46] these are prayers that we could have
[1:00:47] before every service ourselves
[1:00:48] personally then he says speak to us
[1:00:50] through the things that he has promised
[1:00:52] for this day
[1:00:54] he's preaching the voice of the sign so
[1:00:56] he's wanting it to be impactful for the
[1:00:58] voice of this day Paul didn't go and
[1:01:00] preach a meeting to Ephesus and knowing
[1:01:03] that they were all taught under Apollos
[1:01:05] and just did a pep rally right around
[1:01:07] the baptism of John
[1:01:09] think about it
[1:01:11] Paul could have gone to ephodus Ephesus
[1:01:13] or ephodus for that matter and found out
[1:01:16] that they were Disciples of John and
[1:01:17] that they'd been baptized in the baptism
[1:01:19] of John and that Apollos had taught him
[1:01:21] and just cheered him on and rallied them
[1:01:22] on in what they already knew but it was
[1:01:25] the present truth and unfolding of God's
[1:01:27] word and he knew that what they had
[1:01:29] received by the preach of the Gospel had
[1:01:31] brought him to that place and they were
[1:01:33] at the doorstep of the next promise
[1:01:36] now if he had came and preached against
[1:01:38] Apollos preached against John the
[1:01:39] Baptist think of how hard his work would
[1:01:41] have been to bring him to Christ
[1:01:43] right think about how hard it would have
[1:01:45] been all Palace that knucklehead doesn't
[1:01:46] know nothing
[1:01:48] that guy's just all about his blogs and
[1:01:50] he's just all about the numbers and have
[1:01:51] you seen his Instagram account there's
[1:01:52] nothing to that guy and he could have
[1:01:54] just tried to run to paulus down or he
[1:01:56] could have tried to run John the Baptist
[1:01:58] down he could have just tried to tear
[1:01:59] everything down and then they would have
[1:02:01] been like well then now what do we
[1:02:02] believe well John the Baptist taught
[1:02:03] that Christ was coming you mean that guy
[1:02:05] you said was a knucklehead and didn't
[1:02:06] believe anything and denied him when he
[1:02:08] was in prison and you talked about
[1:02:09] Apollos who didn't know nothing it had
[1:02:10] to be taught by a colon Priscilla then
[1:02:12] would he then what are you going to be
[1:02:13] doing
[1:02:15] Paul took him and brought him further
[1:02:18] he says let the great teacher of the
[1:02:20] Holy teacher
[1:02:21] let the great teacher of the word of the
[1:02:23] Holy Spirit come upon and reveal himself
[1:02:24] to us and make himself known just by the
[1:02:27] evidence of the Resurrection May he come
[1:02:29] among us tonight Lord and visit our
[1:02:31] hearts speak to us through the things
[1:02:32] that he has promised for this day
[1:02:36] May the words that promised for this
[1:02:38] hour be manifested before us that we
[1:02:40] might rest to sure he says where the
[1:02:42] language became very relevant to me in
[1:02:44] this great Troublesome time that you
[1:02:46] said would come upon the Earth to try
[1:02:48] all people
[1:02:50] remembering God of this evil age she
[1:02:52] will betrayed by the word she'll come
[1:02:54] face to face under temptation of the
[1:02:55] enemy to this this challenge the trial
[1:02:57] people and
[1:02:58] now I'm expecting some pretty hearty
[1:03:00] amens on this one
[1:03:01] and it certainly has come to that time
[1:03:03] father when manner tried and there are
[1:03:05] so many different angles till no one
[1:03:07] hardly knows what to do
[1:03:10] angles
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:13] this way somebody coming that way
[1:03:14] somebody coming at this way somebody's
[1:03:15] saying the whole thing is wrong all
[1:03:16] these different things all these
[1:03:18] different angles and he says a person
[1:03:20] hardly knows what to do but Lord I pray
[1:03:22] that you will make known to us tonight
[1:03:23] that you're here and with us it's here
[1:03:26] to help us grant our requests for we ask
[1:03:28] it in Jesus name
[1:03:30] so many different angles to where people
[1:03:32] don't know what to do
[1:03:35] oh God help us as Believers as
[1:03:37] proponents of Truth you being stewards
[1:03:39] of the Mysteries your testimony may your
[1:03:41] testimony not cause a disconcordant
[1:03:43] angle
[1:03:45] may your path your trajectory your faith
[1:03:47] not create some conflicting angle oh may
[1:03:50] we all just let our lives harmonize with
[1:03:52] the word of God so there's not just so
[1:03:54] many different angles where your people
[1:03:55] don't know what to do
[1:03:58] but he says if he'll make himself known
[1:04:00] that he's here and he's with us then
[1:04:01] he'll help us to know the right angle
[1:04:04] then that's his prayer
[1:04:07] and it's paragraph eight after he's done
[1:04:09] praying he says now tonight I think
[1:04:11] then unless we know the word of God we
[1:04:13] don't know what to do right so many
[1:04:16] different angles until no one knows
[1:04:17] hardly what to do well then we need him
[1:04:18] to come and do what teach us the word of
[1:04:21] God because if we don't know the word we
[1:04:23] don't know what to do we can't have
[1:04:24] faith until we know what is the will of
[1:04:27] God
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:04:29] but and then he says and what then if we
[1:04:32] know it is the will of God the word of
[1:04:34] God says something then we can gladly
[1:04:35] follow that he makes a very curious
[1:04:37] statement now if the Lord Jesus was
[1:04:39] walking around personally on the earth
[1:04:41] tonight in human flesh he said tomorrow
[1:04:43] it will be raining all day long we would
[1:04:45] check our location
[1:04:47] all right
[1:04:48] but he says if the Lord said it's gonna
[1:04:50] be raining even if we're in Phoenix and
[1:04:52] he says it's going to be raining all day
[1:04:53] long tomorrow now it would be very easy
[1:04:55] for me to take an umbrella when I leave
[1:04:56] in the morning because he said it
[1:04:59] so the word of God you know it's Christ
[1:05:01] It prepares you you know he said it's
[1:05:04] gonna rain so I'm going to grab an
[1:05:06] umbrella now if he didn't say it I don't
[1:05:08] know when what to look at then what to
[1:05:10] look at
[1:05:11] so maybe if we don't know he says we're
[1:05:13] silent where God is silent
[1:05:15] but if he hasn't spoken to it then we
[1:05:17] can't say well it's not going to rain he
[1:05:19] just is silent about it
[1:05:21] but if he said it's gonna rain you could
[1:05:22] take an umbrella he says so that's the
[1:05:24] way it is in everything we do we want to
[1:05:26] know the hour the age we are living
[1:05:29] do you not think that this message is
[1:05:32] exactly that that it's Jesus Christ
[1:05:33] telling us personally the time and the
[1:05:36] season and what to expect and whether
[1:05:38] it's going to rain tomorrow so we can
[1:05:40] have an umbrella he told us the time
[1:05:42] that we're living and this word is
[1:05:45] sufficient to prepare for the Rapture
[1:05:48] and for the change
[1:05:50] what the devil wants to do is make it
[1:05:52] fight against itself cause so many
[1:05:53] different angles listen I may be using a
[1:05:56] language that may be a little bit odd
[1:05:57] many times people are not rejecting
[1:05:59] Christianity they're rejecting the
[1:06:01] subculture of the Bible many people do
[1:06:04] not reject the message they reject the
[1:06:06] message subculture associated with it
[1:06:08] and we do not need to be the voice of
[1:06:11] subculture the voice of Politics the
[1:06:14] voice of opinion and personality we must
[1:06:17] be the voice of Christ brother Matthew
[1:06:20] mentioned the statement I believe it was
[1:06:22] Jordan Peterson can we call him brother
[1:06:23] Jordan Peterson we know there is one in
[1:06:25] Tucson at least that there is a there's
[1:06:28] an idea where he makes a statement and I
[1:06:31] don't know if I necessarily agree with
[1:06:32] it but he says Jesus is the only
[1:06:34] Christian or was the only Christian yes
[1:06:36] he was the the the the first Christian
[1:06:40] right he's the one that embodied what it
[1:06:43] means to be christ-like
[1:06:45] because he was Christ then we do not
[1:06:48] want to be the vocalization of our own
[1:06:51] opinions our own ideas our own takes on
[1:06:53] things but we want to be the perfect
[1:06:55] reflection of that one who is Christ
[1:07:00] and he is his word
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:03] to do that it's going to take his word
[1:07:05] lifting up and a promoting of his word
[1:07:09] trust that we can
[1:07:10] fellowship and just pray for me as we
[1:07:12] launch into this subject
[1:07:14] again tonight just foundational things
[1:07:16] God bless you let's Stand Together
