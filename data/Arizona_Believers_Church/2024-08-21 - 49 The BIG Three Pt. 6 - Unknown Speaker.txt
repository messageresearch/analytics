TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but yet brother bam said Satan took the good things of God and perverted them into evil the Bible says in Isaiah 14:12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations this image of Satan being cut down to the ground and being brought down to the Earth it actually is a partner to this did weaken the Nations to weaken it means to disable or to bring low to the ground to bring it to the ground to make it feeble and just as Lucifer was brought to the ground he brought all the people on the face of the Earth to carnality to the flesh to the Earth and he weakened all people this is what he did Lucifer weakened Humanity he weakened the human the the the species that God had brought forth by his spoken word Satan was able to weaken that through his scheme the Bible says in Proverbs 12:4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones this is only so because of Satan scheming this is only so because of Satan working the woman had if she had never been tempted she never been seduced had she never been LED astray through the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life everything would have dwelt together in Perfect Harmony but through the woman in Satan's agenda now there can be a woman that makes a shame and she drains all the life out she's rotness to the bones but a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband brother Braham said a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown and that she should be honored said she's the best thing that God could give him but also the worst thing he could get a hold of if she's not the right one or she's not in her place the best thing God could give you and he says or about the worst thing you can get a hold of so the worst one is what you get a hold of the best one is the one that God gives you and I just want to set that forth because this the woman is brother BR even writes in the church age book how she's brought to this peculiar place place before God and man she's the image of everything righteous and holy but also in the image of everything foul and loathesome and and there's this one on one hand and one on the other and one is sent sent to hell he says and the other is sent to is placed in the very Throne of God as the only place right for her so that she is in this incredible position before God and man and that that one on the other hand that ends up in predition that's Satan's work the other one that ends up in the Thro is God's work now let's look at how this woman has been shaped to be the worst thing that a man could get a hold of and how she could make a shame or be rotness in in the bones in Proverbs 31:30 it says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised now when you read that it seems a favor is deceitful and beauty is vain and we think well that's just a verse in itself uh that thought stands on its own but this conjunction of but is somehow a rebuttal or U the opposite contradictory to uh the the the deceit of favor and the vanity of beauty it says but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised so when it when it speaks of the deceit of favor and the vanity of beauty it's related to the woman related to the woman herself or even what the woman can represent as favor which is charm or acceptance is deceit ful and this deceit is something that's fraudulent or fake so there could be a certain charm that somebody puts on a Charisma as we young people say these days the Riz that someone might have and the pull that someone might have and think oh that's they they've really got it and and they they're really charismatic and they're they're just they've kind of got that personality going for them and the Bible's saying that kind of acceptance that kind of popularity that way with people is deceitful it's fraudulent and it says Beauty is vain that the beauty is the shape or the Symmetry and beauty and even favor or acceptance is a false representation of a person that vain it's vanity it's empty it's deceitful and this is what Satan has swn into Humanity all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life in order for there to be favor that is deceitful or beauty that is vain it has to be somehow its Genesis in the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised which is different that fear of God the subjection to the word of God is one who is not deceived by favor or uses favor to deceive it's one who is not cut up in the vanity of beauty nor is one who is vain a beautiful and a vain way but it's someone that fears God but this is what Satan has designed different kind of woman for a woman's World in 2 Corinthians CH 4:4 this is to me uh maybe the most important script scripture tonight that I'd like to share uh is in terms of what we're trying to express in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not I realize there's a lot of scriptures before and after that give much more color to this but in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them here the God of this world has blinded the minds of people so and we see this image of Samson where the eyes are poked out that's a consequence of something so the God of this world has blinded the minds of people so that they cannot see the true image of God remember when brother elizer ministered on character and how Satan in the and I was just so inspired by these things so I think this is maybe the third service in a raw I've referred back to it but he he was showing how that Satan when when he said I want to be like the most high he didn't even have the right concept of God so it wasn't like oh I want to be like God and I want to be Christlike and I want to be Godlike and I want to have his heart and I want to have his character he had a perverted perception of what God should be or what God was so when he said I want to be like the most high His image of God was perverted and Satan was preoccupied with the visual there's a part I want you to catch is he was preoccupied with the external the visible and and notice the how contradictory this is to God God is perfectly content with hiding himself in Simplicity God is perfectly content yay he is a God that hideth himself he's a God that hides himself in Simplicity and is happy to reveal himself in the same but Satan wants to be declared and made known in opulence something Grand and something great as he says in Ezekiel 28:12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus say the Lord God thou sealstone and perfect in Beauty when it said thou seest it up it means you draw your own image you draw your own likeness you form yourself and you form yourself as a you form a portrait of yourself and you've represented yourself as the Perfection of wisdom and Beauty this is what's in the heart of Satan Satan is interested in the perception and what you see and the and the and what the mind will do as we say that Satan chose the battleground of the mind he chose man's mind that means he is interested in the eye and what it would produce and what the mind can do with it whereas God chose the soul right where their hidden character of God is so he has he's only interested in image Satan is the author of The Big Three he is the perverter of money women and popularity the Bible says he is the God of this world and he wants to Blind Minds so that don't they don't see the true image of God so he wants to present a False Image as God in the Bible says he sets himself forth as God to be worshiped as God and we read that the God of this world brother benam calls it the God of this evil age it's Satan's Eden he is the the ruler in this Eden and brother BR said this is a woman's world it's a woman's church it's a woman's age he says now we find out now that we're coming in our age and any Bible teacher knows that the last age of Pentecost is leoda leoda means woman in the Greek a time when women take over he's associating that very closely when he says it means woman in Greek Leo leis was a a powerful powerful wealthy woman who was divorced and so it it it is represented by this woman it's a woman's age and notice how brother Branham makes the Le Dean age this divorced woman synonymous with the Pentecostal age and he says in the sermon marriage and divorce which were drawn a lot from this he said the world is beautiful so it can deceive I mean Cosmos the order of the world is what he says the order of this world the God of this world the world that we now live in the age that we now live in is so beautiful so it can deceive it's beautiful so it can deceive he says great fine places and luxury this is how Satan has built his Eden to look beautiful he wants to present it as powerful he wants to present it as uh Grand and gorgeous and beautiful and this is even maybe the things we could say that he presented to Jesus said look at the kingdoms look how beautiful they are and Jesus was able to look past the veneer he's able to look past the Optics look past all the Great accomplishments and all the beauty and all the opulence and see the character of it so that's the age that we're living in where there's always going to be some uh some something presented to the ey something visually to get us to be seduced by it because it seems to be so great and the woman is is a product of this dis or this world of beauty Satan has designed the woman to appeal to be driven by and to appeal to the lust of the eyes now we might think wellow the lust of the eyes is equated with women and so therefore men are capable of lusting because they see a beautiful woman and so a man is tempted to lust of the eyes but realize as a man is tempted by the lust of the eyes that's what would drive the woman is the lust of the eyes so it's not that the man himself is the only one that has to worry about these things but it's a spirit that works upon all Humanity Satan is what I'm wanting to emphasize tonight is showing that Satan is the woman's designer and he designed her visually to work in the way of the lust of the eyes in 1 Peter chapter 3: 3-5 speaking of a Godly woman these women who were in subjection to their husband these women of old as Peter refers to him who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of platting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel now we can't say that these things are wrong and not to do to them otherwise we would never braid our hair never put gold and never wear clothes right but he's obviously identifying some spirit that drives this as uh what is necessary and what we need to have and what needs to presenting yourself in a way to be outwardly pleasing let this woman adorning not be this adorning this uh ornamentation this decoration this present how they present themselves let it not be of the platting of the hair the wearing of gold or the putting of Apparel in other words whose World let it not be the outward World whose adorning whose Arrangement let it not just be the outward world but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight height of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands notice how there is this comparison between those who trust in God and would Adorn themselves in a Meek and quiet spirit and how that God looking upon that is pleased by it and he sees it as something of Great Value and it's the hidden man of the heart and Peter is saying but let us not be preoccupied Ed with the external man because that is what Satan's Eden is occupied with again Satan is preoccupied and he's driven by the visual he wants things to look right he wants things to appeal a certain way and that's where all the time and attention is in the Optics the things that can be seen the things that can be touched whereas God wants to hide himself in the inner part and he wants this ornament not necessarily something tangible but yet something that can speak something that can be touched an ornament of a Meek and quiet spirit in the hidden man of the heart that's the that's the difference between God's work and the work of Satan Satan's only worried about Optics the outward the external he's preoccupied with the visual and God's content with hiding himself in the heart of man and so a woman should be concerned about the World hidden in her heart but brother bam says in marriage and divorce sin is beautiful to the eyes of the world but God is Not featured in that kind of beauty so did you know that God is featured in character beautiful character when you take this sermon you begin to study it out in marriage and divorce he's showing us that Satan features himself in physical Beauty and I guess there's uh maybe there's this inclination to say well I guess if it's beautiful it's of the devil I remember telling one brother one time who could sing really really good and preach really really good and I said man nobody can be that good one of those anointings has got to be false it was a very dear friend still is a dear friend just called me the other day but uh still just because something's beautiful we don't necessarily say oh well that must be Wicked that must be evil we have to recognize that there is a beauty that Satan is trying to achieve and it's deceitful and sin is beautiful to the eyes I've been thinking a lot about Moses how he turned down the pleasures of this world for a season he rejected it turned down everything that it had because sin is pleasing it's enticing it's seductive and he says the beauty of this world is deceitful but God is Not featured in a worldly Beauty he's featured in character Peter says don't let your uh preoccupation be with the outward adorning of the platting of the hair the wearing of gold and the putting on of apparel don't let that be what is going to testify of you as being beautiful and being attractive and don't pre be preoccupied with that but Adorn yourself with a meek and quiet spirit I say it doesn't matter how holy you dress if you don't have a Meek and quiet Spirit there there's not a skirt long enough to cover it up right there's not a blouse baggy enough there's not hair long enough if it's not the right inward man if it's not the hidden man of the heart it comes through eventually and so s Satan features himself in Beauty he wanted to make Heaven a better place Satan is up there and going you know what I think I could be a better God than this God I can make Heaven look better than than what God did with it and so Satan can only do one thing that's impersonate cannot produce an original cannot create he can only pervert he can only impersonate and and I want you to think about this and maybe just record this in your mind and be very perceptive when you're studying the message of the hour listening to the message of the hour how that Satan is going to have a bride and it's a false bride and it's going to impersonate and so it's it's not necessarily Catholicism but it's evolved to Pentecostalism that's where Satan's false bride is going to be now in the sermon marriage and divorce again we're just trying to show Satan being this designer of the woman it's that external lust of the eyes that he's preoccupied with he says have you noticed the increase of beauty of women the increase of beauty of women in this day and he refers to Pearl O'Brien or Pearl Brian and Clara ba and and he refers to them as being the most beautiful women in the world at that time I went back and researched some of them and brother B said you know they wouldn't even hold a candle to just some snickel Fritz today some teenage girl today and all you have to do is go back and look at them and be like yep he's right like you don't even need to find a teenager from the 60s to agree and he said look at how women have become more and more beautiful this is what he says the increase of the beauty of women is showing the time of deception now there's nothing can stoop like her and she's designed so that she can be deceiving I know this may seem hurtful or some may say misogynistic or chauvinistic or whatever but there is um there's this truth he's trying to bring out of how Satan has designed the woman he says now I'm not talking about you sisters he said I'll get to your place in a minute says you have a special calling for redemption in this hour he said it started started with a woman it'll end with a woman he's saying a woman started in the beginning she'll end in the end he saying he's saying in a positive way so there's a there's a uh there's a place for the woman if I could even say it this way and and I think I'll come to it at the end I'll say it now hopefully I'll remember in the end Samson in the end looks like a woman with his eyes um poked out and he's completely defeated and so there's a way that like Satan is perverting gender roles and perverting the woman a a and and defiling things and mixing things up whereas God wants the woman to become like him but in the right way doesn't want her to become more worldly and more uh uh feminine in a worldly sense doesn't want her get caught up in the things are going but he wants her to be that bone of his bone flesh of his flesh that perfect expression of his character so he says there's nothing that can stoop as low as a woman because she's design designed to be deceiving he says and Satan is really working on her today in these last days because he is her designer he says I can prove that now go right back at the beginning who started to work on her Adam or Satan God or Satan and it was Satan is the answer to that he says that's her designer it's her Chief weapon to throw man to her filth being a pretty woman she can sway a man any way she wants to this is brother Brandon making these observations about the power of a woman been reading through a thinking man's filter where in brother bradam is talking about how use he's using the woman at least the way I'm looking at he's talking about the filter he says he use it to sell uh tobacco and using Beauty and we they say sex cells is what they say and they use women and to do this some frequency in in the 20th century where they're just for no reason at all an advertisement for a male product a product for men has a woman on it and it's like oh I got to get the shaving cream right and it's like all there is is a a woman in it and so it's using this to make some sort of Association anchor something in the mind of man because this is how man how this has been sown into Mankind and cultivate and develop she's the chief weapon to throw at a man that can sway him him he says brother it ain't the bootleg joint down there that gets the man it's the pretty woman walking down the street twisting herself half dressed remember about the Le Dean Church the Pentecostal Church descending Into Darkness descending into chaos that brother Adam saw dancing to rock androll music she was naked and so it's a spiritual type and it's actually a physical phenomenon women stripping themselves down twisting themselves half dressed he said that's the deceiver right there and she's deadly with it he says absolutely deadly he says you may question me about Satan being her designer but that's the truth Satan designed her he still does it now just let me just say this as what I'm summarizing here is that Satan has made the woman to entice he's made her seductive he's made her to be an instrument whether it be in marketing or whether it be in any kind of situation where she is trying to uh draw upon a man's flesh draw upon his desires to deceive him and sway a man anyway she wants to and he says she's deadly with it and this is Satan's design when he got to the woman in the beginning he wanted to design her so he could use her all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life the big three are designed to distract and to deceive to entice the call away to intoxicate ate to to cause us to become into bondage and so we could say that the woman the Modern Woman this woman h a Womanhood and and The Feminine gender has been designed to deceive designed to entice to lead astray and as it did to Samson bind him and cause him to lose his power and this is true both in the natural and in the spiritual spiritual fornication is the evil twin of physical fornication or it's the it's the same spirit manifested in different ways so wherever there's spiritual fornication it is akin to and it is like physical fornication this uncleanness so the the way that Satan would use a woman in the natural to cause a man to be sede to cause a man to lust to cause a man to be enticed he's doing the same thing in the spiritual now I really what I've just done is I kind of changed subjects a little bit but I'm wanting you to realize that we say oh money women and popularity that's what's going to get some people and so you start trying to see well what's that preacher's problem is it money women or popularity and do you realize the problem could be women but it's not the sister in the Pew it's the church that he's leading because the church is a woman the Temptation even for a woman or the temptation of woman is not just beautiful females but it's also churches it's organization you think I'm glad we're non-denominational well that's the spirit you know what it takes to be an organization organize around an interpretation of the word and put a period on it right you want an organization just find some consensus as to way you think things should be a a a and get your colle Collective together and rally around it and you are an organization you don't have to be an official denomination you don't have to have a headquarters you don't have an actual voted on leader but you can be under the spirit organization and you could take a g genuine move of God and put a period on it put your stamp on it put your judgment on it and say this is it this is it right here and be an organization so the spirit of a woman is the spirit of denomination Spirit of organization it's the spirit of Babylon this money women and popularity women is not necessarily A physically beautiful woman but it can also be an organization or a church in judges chap 16: 19- 21 as we look at Sam listen deceived by the world deceived by this beautiful Delilah and when we get to verse 19 we as we read through it on Sunday and maybe with some Dramatics on my part but still it kind of begs the question Samson what is going on it's almost as if every time she said wake up we're like yeah buddy wake up and he wakes up physically but never spiritually either that D or he just was so reckless to think I know what she's trying to do I know what she's trying to do brother bradam says in one place he got so comfortable in my own words he just thought he could get away with it kept flirting around with it he just thought even to the point where he deceived himself into thinking I can literally give her my secret and it won't affect me and so now she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head this is what the church can do low you to sleep put you to sleep on her knees and then have men cut off your hair cut off your Seven Locks and she began to afflict him now the church we I say the church but the woman begins to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the Philistines be upon the Samson and he woke out of his sleep and said I'll go out just as I had before but he says he didn't know that the Lord had departed from him but the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with feathers of brass and he did grind in the prison house brother Bram said this is a symbol of the nation a symbol of the church a symbol of an individual that's let loose of God you'll find that as brother Brandon preaches a number of sermons on Samson he is using Samson to rebuke the Pentecostal church and here he is with this head shaved what happened when his head was shaved it broke the vow he had to God and what is this what is this likened unto a dishonorable woman as we read it in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 how there was this when a woman cuts her hair with her woman the hair is given to her for her glory and the Shaving of Samson's head was a sign of dishonoring his vow so Samson presents this interesting image of one who's been so influenced by a woman that he begins to manifest the Disobedience of a woman and he shaves his head in contradiction to his vows of Nazarite and then his eyes are plucked out showing what the spiritual blindness this is his this is what he is culminates in this image of Samson and now I'm just going to spend maybe the next 15 minutes or so before we close looking at what brother bradam says about Samson in this condition he said there stood Samson but the spirit of the Lord didn't come on him anymore or he says it's no more he wasn't anointed he had been stripped of this power by a woman that lured him away from the Commandments of the Lord I wonder today if that isn't something like our churches women in the Bible represents church so brother bram's the one that makes this direct connection between Samson's failure by Delilah to our Temptation or the taking away from us our rights in God or leading us astray from the Commandments of the Lord by Churches by organizations by denominational Spirits by movements contrary to the word of God he's been stripped of his power and he goes I wonder if that's something that's happening to us through a woman which represents the church and he makes these statements I wonder if we haven't listened to the lure of other denominations says I wonder if we haven't went off on some great wild Tantrums to build a church that's a little better than the meth Methodist or Presbyterian a wild tantrum to build something better a wild tant when it's like well this has failed and this hasn't worked let's just do this and let's do that remember the impatience of so-called Liber says I wonder if we haven't prited and pulled from one to the other to try to make our organizations grow identifying a spirit the spirit that he says this woman Delilah this temptress of Samson represents and the servant presuming he says about Samson he got himself wrapped around her and she wrapped him around the finger and he found out all his strength was gone I how you could just be tied to something to get wrapped around the finger I believe that a Believer should never get wrapped around the finger of a church shouldn't our identity shouldn't be so wrapped up in the church and so wrapped up into church politics and church position and wrapped up into the p and our identity so intricately tied to the local assembly to we lose the reality of our sovereignty as individuals in the body of Christ and our identity with our head which is Jesus Christ which is what the the local church is to serve the reason why that you should find yourself at home tonight in this church is because you're part of the church which is the body of Christ in this local church is caused to serve that and that's why you should feel at home that's why you should feel a part of it and we shouldn't be so wrapped around the finger of an organization a denomination or even a church identity to where God can't lead us deeper into his truth he's wrapped around her finger and all his strength was gone that's exactly what's happened to the church today WRA itself around these Creeds and man-made things in organizations and denominations and getting away from the word of God in formalism formalism is not of God the formalism that we could say that brother B identify is where he said there's two sides there's formalism and there's fanaticism he says one over on this end one's over on that end and both of them are wrong and really anytime you see that the brother brandom is calling out and identifying fanaticism or formalism uh if he's only singling out formalism you got to realize at the same time he's calling out fanaticism cuz he's not advocating for the opposite the opposite would just still be just as wrong so he says that they've been called away from the word of God into formalism and to make ourselves formal and say well the spirit of God doesn't move anymore and God doesn't use this and you shouldn't shout or you shouldn't cry you shouldn't get emotional and you try to water the rot it down or cut things like you're wrong you're absolutely wrong well this is the way that it should be and the gifts are this way and we don't have them anymore and why would you even want the gifts when the Gift Giver himself is here and I I guess the response to some men that teach that is well did you when when your wife got you did she throw away the engagement ring she gave you you gave her it's like hold on I'll be right back I got to go tell her to throw away the engagement ring throw away all the gifts your husband ever gave you now that you got the husband get rid of everything he ever gave you God doesn't do that he doesn't require us to do it so there's a formalism that's anti- but just on the same depth of of Satan the same depths of being wrong is the idea of fanaticism and this is what happens to the church you'll notice this it accompanies both groups the formal and the Fanatics the church looks like the rest of the world acts like the rest of the world and first thing you know you find the holy spirit's gone and the strength of the Gospel is away from you what is the strength of the Gospel ask yourself that this is what this woman brother B says represented she had Samson wrapped around his finger and therefore she could control him and get him away from the word of God in the sermon once more he says let a lure of a woman take him from the word of God talking about Samson Delilah took Samson from The Word of Promise now take that to heart where we have in our day A Word of Promise what is the message for our day what is it that we're focusing on what is it that we're feeding on what is it that ought to have the preeminence not some glare of another age not some other bygone idea but we it's the Word of Promise he says the woman took Samson from The Word of Promise and so has the Jezebel of this day taken the church learn it from The Word of Promise God's holy Bible and he says the same thing and he speaks in Revelation 17 the 17th chapter he says the Catholic church is represented there she was the mother of Harlot she was a and the mother of harlots see it had to be churches he says not boys it was girls Protestant churches a mother of harlots this is where I'm wanting to emphasize that this woman that we see in this trifecto of money women in popularity this lust of the eyes is not just a beautiful woman to seduce men into lust and perversion of the flesh but it's also a religious spirit brother bam said it's it's girls Protestant churches as soon as they organized they done the same thing they did there they stripped themselves from the word and follow the dictations of some organization this is the failure of Pentecost the failure of Pentecost is when they organized you say when they organized what happened they looked just as Pentecostal they shouted just as much they danced just as enough they had church services just the same but they had put a period right and they kicked Christ out of their churches they organized and they separated and he says it's the spirit of the Catholic church I've made reference to this a couple times brother B says in the mark of the beast and the Seal of God part two Beauty that's the attraction of the eye the Catholic Church learned that long ago that through the eye is the gate to the soul to make Beauty and so forth and people fall for that so this is the spirit of Catholicism this is the evolution of the spirit all the way up to the this this day of impersonation as Janice and jambre whed Moses through impersonation this to try to manifest themselves in the power of God it's it's the spirit of Optics it's the spirit of the visual it's the spirit of the eye through the eye it's the lust of the eye to make Beauty make something beautiful and cause the people to fall for it he says Hollywood learned it a long time ago and the devil knew it before any of you did so we say well I knew it before that no the devil knew it before any of you did the spirit of Babylon in Revelation 17 the spirit that's upon the Catholic church and the Protestant churches these girls is the spirit of the attraction of the eye if you could win the eye if you can win the Optics this is what happens even when it comes to a a silent majority and the spiral of Silence that sometimes could take over people is when it appears as if something is broadly accepted it appears as if something is the way that it should be even even if it's not the majority everyone just acquiesces and gives into it because of the power of perception there's many more statements we could read along these lines maybe we'll read some more on it on Sunday but if I could summarize it this way and then just read a couple more statements before we close that God G made the woman and she has a special position with God a special calling a special designation as a matter of fact I could say that she was God's objective from the very beginning that he the Earth was made for the purpose of getting a woman out of it a woman of himself he he wanted to have a bride of his choosing it's at the heart purpose of God so when the woman came forth in the garden and Satan saw her come forth she immediately became his Target his attack because he's following the progression and he's even following the word of God to Adam and he knows that she has something to do with immortality she has something to do with life she has something to do with the image of God and so he attacked her and being unable to bring forth his own woman he used the woman and the beding ground of the woman to bring forth another race of human beings upon the face of the Earth as one blood is spread over the whole earth and it's not the original between Adam and the woman it is mixed it is a mixed uh uh race mixed people from the very beginning and so there has been a weakness sown into humanity and as men we don't Point our finger at the woman like Adam did is my wife we're all guilty we're all born between Eve and and Satan but we've got to recognize what I want you to catch in this aspect just as mankind has been defiled and manhood has been defiled and there's this wrong image of man that you can't find in denominations you can't find in organization you can't find it in trumpism you can't find it in the world today you can't find it in liberalism you can't find it anywhere you can only find the real image of a man in Christ you can only find it in the word in the full balance of the word of God and so it's just the same for the man but I'm want you to recognize through the lust of the eyes s has designed the woman with that in mind the power that she has the sway and the pull that she has and he's saying that a worldly woman a woman who dresses ungodly a woman who presents herself in a certain way Jesus said that when a man looks at her and begins to conceive these things in his mind he has committed the act in his heart already with her by the way that she presents him herself and there's a guilt in that lusting there's a guilt in that that wrestling that a man would have with those things and just as we could say that type of woman that in the natural would try to deceive and try to seduce and try to work on a man through the feelings of his flesh there's a spirit of the W away from Christ and to something else and and even if it might well I I'm I'm losing just some perverse things that the world would present and and you have if we have in pride month all these the parades and and that's that's not what's going to they're already leaning that way but what he wants to do is he wants to present that apart from the word that looks better that sounds better that feels and then he says notice a man looking at her pretty red lips and painted face and shorts and bikinis and every what she's got a real thinking man won't look at her now a man that's a church member will look at her and admire her now I want you to take this in a spiritual sense I I'm saying this to young men here today to older men to married and single divorced whatever it is that as red-blooded men you got to realize the devil is trying to find his way into your mind find some way to get you preoccupied with even the physical to cause you to lust and now also to the same degree that we would say that that is a work of the devil now think of this in the spiritual sense and brother B says a church member will look at her and admire her if you're a church member and you're wrapped around the finger of the church you'll admire a church that has spiritually got bobbed hair wearing makeup and shorts and and dressed up for show says but I don't care how she looks to the eye a thinking man will turn his head and what does he say multiple times in this sermon turn your head and he says and even begins to speak in a real personal way and we would say that as men of God in this hour as sons of God and as young men and and just men in general we have got to have a discipline to turn our head to avert your gaze to to not entertain it to not look at it and and notice even how the subtle ways that it begins to develop itself he says you've got to turn your head he says I don't care how pretty it looks a man who's got God's word as his filter that thinking man will turn his head and we've got to be the same way in the spiritual sense that when Satan is trying to present to us a woman that is full of lust and full of adultery and full of spiritual fornication but it's trying to entice us to the lust of the I you've got to turn your head he says why he's been through God's filter and he knows to look upon her as adultery in his heart he don't think she's pretty say isn't she a pretty thing not to him it isn't it is she's a filthy looking miserable Jezebel wretch to a thinking man think of a church now he says a Son of God looks upon her with shame that he even belongs to the family she belongs to that's right how could that be my sister and act like that you thinking spiritually even she's pulled through one filter and he come through another he won't think she's pretty not at all that's not Beauty to a real man of God but how deceitful is it we're not talking about a strip teas in the natural where if we were just like we were going to just do a test and we're going to ask the men well who do you think's beautiful and you show them some sort of strip teas and he's going to be like can't fool me right we could all be Supreme Court Justices then and say I know it when I see it and that's not that's not right that's ungodly but do you realize Satan today is not presenting his Bride As a strip teas he's got all the red herrings and all the the he's got all the maybe not red herrings he's got all the other ones on the fringes and they have their job but in the last days it'll be so close it'll deceive the elect but it's not possible but brotherr says it so much so that it'll be so close that if it were it would happen so you've got to realize but for God's grace and the impossibility that you cannot be seduced in this end time through the devil's bride it would happen because it's so close I believe that the bride is right going to have the full word and with the full word in her midst she's going to live righteous she's going to live holy she's going to live clean she's going to live above the world she's going to have Christ in her midst so there'll be Divine Healing in her midst there'll be salvation in her midst where there's salvation and Divine Healing where there's oil there's joy where there's the presence of God there can be weeping I believe that people speak in tongues as it's happened in this church I believe people can shout people will dance I believe that all those things will follow because we're living people who respond to the stimulus of the Holy Spirit and so the bride will be living clean and living a certain way but I'm not going to be seduced by a woman that tries to dress up like the bride in lie to me about the message and seduce Us by being preoccupied with the visual the sermon marriage and divorce brother bam says a man looks natural beauty it's deceiving and that's why a woman was given that beauty to deceive he says for deception a beautiful woman if she don't use it in the right way it's a curse to her that will send her to Hell quicker than anything else I know of if she can be pretty sure as long as she stays with her husband and does what's right and that's fine and dandy but she can take the same thing and how she can deceive with it for it was given to her to do so this is what women are doing today to men sisters I think it's I think it would be good to look upon mothers to look upon your sons with pity that they're living in the day and age that they're living in I think I I think as wives you should look at your husbands with a Pity and prayer in the day and age that they're living in not with judgment not with indignation not with the the spin that the devil would want to get realize Satan is after them with a Vengeance and he takes these things in the natural to deceive to weaken and to defile a man's conscience and in the same way it happens in the natural he's trying to do it in the spiritual and the Very things that make a church beautiful and the Very things that could make a church a place that would would be welcoming to the the Holy Spirit a church can take that and use it to deceive the very thing that's given her he says notice but God is featured in character and what does the scripture say there was no Beauty in him that we would desire him that Christ physically was not imposing Christ when he spoke they didn't say never man spake like this man because his bar tone voice and because it was just like man that that's just so smooth and who knows how it sounded but it was the words that's that's what he spoke and so he was he may have not have been any beauty physically the Bible says we turned our eyes from him he might have been the type of person you'd see like oh my goodness you I would I would listen to him but he's kind of hard to look at he's kind of hard to listen to so it's as this he been stripped from the visual Satan is over there presenting himself as a Judas beautiful smart a a charismatic and you say well that that's got to be the right one and here's Jesus this ugliness but yet he was featured in character there was never a character like him on earth right brother B says now we find out today that the church character Satan and his group look after big beautiful churches beautiful things that's what the world looks at today oh it's the pastor the great so and so so times and so and so so Priestly and godly walk out with his big robes and things like that well thank God we don't have robes right he's talking about the visual talking about theatrics the theater The Mask the presentation it's the stage lights but then when we all go home we turn the stage lights off the smoke machine's not going right we leave and then on Monday morning when it's time to get real and the rubber hits the road it's time for business you're hungry for another stage show he said they call that beauty but the real saints of God look for the character of the Vindicated word that's what the Saints did in that day when they saw Jesus he was nothing to look at but they saw God was in him they saw God was with him and that's what we look for today is the beauty of the Vindicated word the character of the Vindicated word there there's a front that can be put on we could you how that they can build a set I think anybody who's been familiar with Sight and Sound and uh and the way that they can build a set and make things look so real and they do it with Hollywood what is what call they can build a city from scratch and make it look and they built it it's wooden Nails it's all sorts of things that been fabricated and it conveys to you a world of Wonder and beauty and it's so engaging but if you could see it without the filters if you could see it without the post production if you could see it for what it really was like well I mean that's Rinky Dink and all the smok and mirrors and the dog and pony show and all the things that the devil's trying to put on trust me being human beings there's a draw on the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life but we've got to exercise spirit ual discernment and use the hidden man of the heart that character down inside of us to recognize I see character in the beauty of the Vindicated word and I cannot let a Delilah seduce me loow me to sleep in her lap and cause some man to chop off my Seven Locks and cause me to dishonor the headship of the word and I want you to recognize just how that just with M as it was with money as it is with women it means a lot more than just the obv let's bow our heads and pray tonight musicians if you'd come and then let's just stand together
