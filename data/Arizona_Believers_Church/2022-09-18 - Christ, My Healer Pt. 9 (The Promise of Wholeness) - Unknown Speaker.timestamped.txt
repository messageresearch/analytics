[0:00] my title today uh the subtitle
[0:03] on this part nine is
[0:05] the promise
[0:06] of wholeness
[0:08] the promise of wholeness and we'll uh
[0:10] kind of get into
[0:12] in a deeper way just exactly
[0:14] um what that means but i'd say maybe for
[0:17] a thesis statement that our um
[0:21] we're wanting to
[0:22] focus our faith we've been talking about
[0:24] faith even in the promise of healing we
[0:25] know it's by faith
[0:27] but focus kind of on this focus our
[0:29] faith on the promise to be made whole
[0:31] you'll find a number of scriptures where
[0:33] it speaks of jesus when he healed
[0:35] somebody says and they were made whole
[0:36] been reading through those and looking
[0:38] at them
[0:39] and as a part of this in terms of our
[0:41] healing and maybe being used in that
[0:43] phrase to be made whole i'm wanting to
[0:45] begin to look at things that hinder our
[0:48] healing
[0:49] i recognize that a lot of us are
[0:51] we understand the promise of healing we
[0:54] understand and believe divine healing so
[0:56] sometimes it's not really just getting
[0:58] to the bottom of what it is and how it
[1:00] happens but really some of the things
[1:01] that keep us from it
[1:03] and what i'd like to be able to identify
[1:05] today is how that divine healing is more
[1:07] than just healing of the body
[1:10] and since divine healing is more than
[1:11] just the healing of the physical body
[1:13] i i begin to recognize that it may be
[1:16] that our physical healing is found in
[1:19] recognizing just where the divine
[1:22] healing resides and where it's the most
[1:24] significant and that begins to move
[1:26] barriers and one thing that we'll
[1:28] definitely be touching on is how that
[1:29] divine healing is not just for this this
[1:32] physical body that can see and taste and
[1:35] feel but also our spirits and our minds
[1:37] our hearts as it were
[1:39] now john chapter five we'll start with
[1:40] verse one we're just going to walk
[1:41] through this i'm recognizing today that
[1:43] it seems to be much hotter than it
[1:44] normally is i even just checked to make
[1:46] sure the air conditioner was working if
[1:48] we just get too comfortable we'll just
[1:50] stop we we know we always have a time
[1:52] to pick pick this up later i wouldn't
[1:54] want to just keep driving this home and
[1:56] all of a sudden we all just are on the
[1:57] other other dimension and we all died of
[2:00] heat stroke because i didn't know when
[2:01] to stop and i'd say well this is where
[2:03] we wanted to be after all right
[2:05] but uh we'll just be real sensitive to
[2:07] um the uh the heat today john chapter
[2:10] five verse one if we'll start here and
[2:12] we'll just we'll just be kicking this
[2:13] off it says after this there was a feast
[2:16] of the jews and jesus went up to
[2:17] jerusalem now there is at jerusalem by
[2:20] the sheep market a pool which is called
[2:22] in the hebrew tongue bethesda so to say
[2:25] call this a sheep market it's going to
[2:27] stay here
[2:28] having five porches in the hebrew tongue
[2:30] bethesda having five porches this points
[2:32] to a very specific location that they
[2:35] say here he calls it the house of mercy
[2:37] bethesda it's called the house of mercy
[2:41] in these or in this area in these lay a
[2:43] great multitude of impotent folk
[2:45] of blind halt withered waiting for the
[2:48] moving of the water so because this was
[2:50] the during the time of the feast of the
[2:52] jews then there may have been a lot more
[2:54] that were there during this time it was
[2:56] very crowded it's very near roman
[2:57] garrison
[2:58] where soldiers um stayed so there might
[3:01] have been even just gentiles there
[3:02] present
[3:03] to witness the phenomena or maybe even
[3:05] themselves partake in it
[3:07] and john describes it this way and it
[3:09] says for an angel went down at a certain
[3:12] season into the pool and troubled the
[3:13] water
[3:14] whosoever then first after the trouble
[3:16] of the water stepped in was made a hole
[3:19] of whatsoever disease he had
[3:22] now when we read this and maybe we
[3:24] haven't taken time just to consider what
[3:27] exactly may have been happening or what
[3:29] a remarkable occurrence this was for
[3:31] these things to take place but this
[3:32] would be activity that we would call
[3:34] paranormal
[3:35] this is beyond the scope of normal
[3:38] scientific understanding
[3:40] to be able to explain why there was a
[3:43] certain moment when the waters would be
[3:44] stirred and that someone the first one
[3:47] to step in would be made whole now
[3:49] science can no doubt look at this and
[3:51] say what it might have been a spring
[3:53] that fed it and so it was kind of
[3:55] intimate that it would bubble up and
[3:57] stir
[3:57] and they might even say that it was
[3:59] maybe there was some valves or something
[4:01] that they were using in the bath house
[4:03] or using at the roman garrison and when
[4:05] these things were opened or maybe even
[4:08] it was done intentionally uh by a priest
[4:11] of some sort of false religion that
[4:12] would cause it to to boil up and bubble
[4:15] up but then even once we explained that
[4:17] you wouldn't really wouldn't be able to
[4:18] explain uh adequately through science
[4:21] why the first person in was healed and
[4:23] nobody else
[4:25] and because of some of these uh
[4:28] notations in this part about the sheep
[4:30] market and the pool
[4:32] called bethesda and five porches and the
[4:34] bar the stirring or the troubling of the
[4:37] water and the healing of the individual
[4:39] this is actually a very controversial
[4:41] story not among us but among academics
[4:44] and scholars and even bible scholars and
[4:46] even the critics
[4:47] john is the only one that records it
[4:50] and there's much
[4:52] criticism about many of the elements of
[4:54] this and i had originally began to kind
[4:56] of build some things i'd been studying
[4:57] on uh here at the at this point but i
[5:00] think we can just circle right back to
[5:02] it and i want to come back to this
[5:04] particular element when we talk about
[5:05] healing cults i think that'll get all of
[5:07] you thinking
[5:08] um thinking very uh concerned because
[5:11] there's a lot of healing cults that are
[5:13] out there
[5:14] and so there's a lot of scholarship uh
[5:16] debating the merit of these this pool
[5:19] and whether the pool actually had
[5:20] healing powers or even if it even had
[5:22] any jewish connection there's a lot of
[5:24] arguments that say that this was um
[5:27] this was a pool that was kind of
[5:28] dedicated to a false deity and so it was
[5:31] a false religion that was using this
[5:33] pool for healing powers
[5:34] and one of the
[5:36] writers wrote this said these practices
[5:38] this practice of going into the pool of
[5:40] water to be healed uh are not well
[5:43] attested in jewish sources which
[5:45] commonly connected healing with prayer
[5:47] to god
[5:48] and so the prayer to god was the primary
[5:51] way you beseech the lord that's how
[5:52] abraham did it for abimelech you beseech
[5:54] the lord and you receive your healing
[5:56] saying these these kind of practices
[5:58] where there might be some sort of
[5:59] supernatural bubbling up of the water an
[6:01] angel stirring the water and someone
[6:03] jumping in it
[6:04] to be healed that's not commonly
[6:06] associated to or even attested by jews
[6:09] and rabbis and jewish sources they say
[6:11] the god of israel did not reserve his
[6:13] favor for those who are best able to
[6:15] help themselves
[6:16] and so in this story it's kind of one of
[6:18] these situations where the first one in
[6:19] is the one that got the favor so they're
[6:21] saying that within jewish tradition the
[6:23] elements here don't necessarily fit
[6:26] but brother branham touches on this
[6:28] story in several places in one
[6:30] particular place where he's speaking
[6:31] earnestly continuing for the faith that
[6:33] was once delivered unto the saints he's
[6:34] preaching this in germany he says now a
[6:36] lot of aristocrats say they're crazy
[6:39] that's no angel
[6:41] but god was healing anyhow
[6:44] and it's this part i think is very
[6:46] important for us to catch god has always
[6:48] had a place of healing since he's been
[6:50] god and man's been man
[6:52] that's right there's always been a
[6:53] preparation for healing since genesis
[6:56] when he raised the brass serpent they
[6:57] started worshiping that he tore that
[6:59] down then he sent an angel on a pool of
[7:01] water and the history says it was
[7:04] terrible i've been reading through a lot
[7:05] of different um
[7:07] books that brother branham read books in
[7:09] his library trying to find where he may
[7:10] have
[7:11] gathered this from but he refers to in a
[7:13] few places how that people would cut one
[7:15] another and fight and stab and maim one
[7:19] another as they're trying to get into
[7:20] the pool
[7:22] so they have this faith to believe that
[7:24] an angel of the lord is stirring the
[7:26] waters
[7:28] but then
[7:29] and they want their healing and they're
[7:30] willing to kill to get it
[7:34] tells you something about this kind of
[7:36] insatiable fanaticism for only the
[7:38] physical part
[7:39] can lead to a lot of craziness and and a
[7:42] lot of behaviors and a lot of thought
[7:44] processes that aren't christ-like that's
[7:46] something to hold in your mind and so
[7:48] brethren touches on that in other places
[7:51] and i will say this even as brother
[7:52] brahms describing it here the method
[7:55] or the means by which a person was
[7:56] healed may seem odd
[7:59] to an angel to visit stir the waters and
[8:03] the first person in it is one that's
[8:04] healed
[8:05] but we know it's god alone that heals
[8:08] that even medicine can't heal
[8:10] no man is a healer there's a lot of ways
[8:12] we could keep uh enforcing that but if
[8:14] there were some means by which somebody
[8:16] had faith to believe that it get in this
[8:18] water they were going to be healed it's
[8:20] god who has designed it that way that a
[8:22] person would be healed
[8:23] and sirs we would see jesus he says ever
[8:26] who's stepping in first got healed of
[8:27] what disease they had they had faith to
[8:29] believe it many criticized it make fun
[8:32] of it but the bible said it was an angel
[8:34] and i believe it god always makes a way
[8:38] so this be to me no matter how much you
[8:40] would research how much you would study
[8:41] no matter which debate uh in uh within
[8:44] the nominal christian world and
[8:45] theologians about well this wasn't in
[8:46] the original and this seems really odd
[8:48] we don't even know what the sheep market
[8:50] is we don't know about this we don't
[8:51] know about that brother adam says it's
[8:53] in the bible i believe it and he's
[8:55] saying he's emphasizing god always makes
[8:57] a way
[8:58] in other words this may seem strange and
[9:00] odd that troubled waters would turn
[9:03] would cause someone to be healed but
[9:05] that wouldn't be odd to us for as
[9:08] christians because god's a healer and
[9:10] god makes a way
[9:12] and so god brother iran says in other
[9:13] places god has always had a way of
[9:16] healing for believers
[9:18] now no matter when how you look at that
[9:20] way whether you're looking in the old
[9:21] testament looking in the new testament
[9:22] or even looking now that way is always
[9:25] pointing to christ
[9:26] the serpent lifted up in the wilderness
[9:28] speaking of the son of man being lifted
[9:30] up and
[9:31] lifted up on a pole christ being lifted
[9:32] up on a tree so there's a lot of things
[9:34] in the old testament that pointed to
[9:37] christ and there's things in the new
[9:38] testament that are in this way pointing
[9:40] back to christ but remember it all
[9:43] points back to the word
[9:45] it's all pointing back to christ even in
[9:47] revelations chapter 22 verse 2. it
[9:49] speaks of how the tree of life is going
[9:51] to be there bearing 12 manner of fruits
[9:53] and the fruit and the leaves of that
[9:55] tree were for the healing of the nations
[9:58] so even in that phrasing whatever it
[10:01] might be actually not just in simple
[10:03] form but in practical application it's
[10:06] the leaves of the tree of life that are
[10:08] for the healing of the nations in other
[10:10] words god always provides a way for
[10:12] healing
[10:13] and whatever means he provides if it's
[10:15] god providing it it all points back to
[10:18] the word it all points back to christ he
[10:20] sent his word and healed their diseases
[10:22] so it's oh wow it's the brass serpent
[10:23] that's what healed them no god said for
[10:26] moses to do it and if they looked on it
[10:28] then they would be healed so it's not
[10:30] the elements of brass or the image of a
[10:32] serpent but it's the word of god behind
[10:35] that image that brought the promise or
[10:37] that brought the healing
[10:39] and so there's always been a way
[10:41] now this scripture to me is one of the
[10:43] most central to our belief in divine
[10:46] healing first peter chapter 2 verse 24
[10:49] who his own self bear our sins and his
[10:51] own body on the tree that we
[10:53] being dead to sins should live unto
[10:56] righteousness by whose stripes ye were
[10:59] healed
[11:00] love how he puts it in that past tense
[11:02] again for us his own self christ bore
[11:05] our sins in his own body on the tree
[11:08] that now we being dead to sin so there
[11:10] has to be some way that we are made dead
[11:13] to sin should live for the purpose of
[11:15] righteousness and then by whose stripes
[11:18] ye were healed
[11:20] this is the promise of healing to the
[11:21] believer and whatever that encompasses
[11:24] this is god's promise so now as peter
[11:27] writes it that through this sacrifice
[11:30] he's made a way for us that we might be
[11:31] dead to sins live unto righteousness by
[11:34] whose stripes we are healed that means
[11:36] now divine healing is not limited to a
[11:39] place
[11:40] it's not limited to a pool outside the
[11:42] sheep market it's not limited to cycles
[11:45] of visitation it is now available in
[11:48] christ
[11:49] ever since the price was paid christ
[11:51] shedding his blood him being resurrected
[11:53] the spirit being sent back
[11:55] from that moment on healing is available
[11:58] through christ
[12:00] brother bradman the sermon behold a
[12:01] greater than solomon is here says if
[12:03] something tells you tonight i believe
[12:05] there's a fountain for healing somewhere
[12:07] god's signal ringing get in right quick
[12:12] now he's not referring to a physical
[12:13] pull he's saying if there's something in
[12:15] your heart telling you that there's been
[12:16] a spiritual fountain opened up that you
[12:18] can be bathed in and being bathed and it
[12:20] received healing he says get in right
[12:22] quick the water's already troubled
[12:25] all you have to do is step right in
[12:28] now he's not referring to the dynamics
[12:30] of that particular service that the an
[12:32] angel visited and stirred the waters but
[12:34] is referring to a fountain being opened
[12:37] up to the believer where the waters are
[12:39] troubled and he says it's all ready all
[12:41] you have to do is step in
[12:42] when did it get troubled brother branham
[12:45] 1900 years ago on calvary the trouble
[12:49] and then on the day of pentecost it
[12:51] really shook the whole thing it really
[12:53] got troubled then now all you have to do
[12:56] is step right into the waters of the
[12:58] spirit and get healed
[13:01] you recognize this now all you have to
[13:03] do is step in there's no place in israel
[13:07] there's no place in america there's no
[13:08] place in africa there's no particular
[13:10] place that we all have to gather we
[13:12] don't have to be every easter in
[13:13] jeffersonville to get our healing it
[13:15] doesn't have to be some cycle of revival
[13:17] but now the waters are stirred now you
[13:19] by faith can step in and receive your
[13:22] healing
[13:25] the bible
[13:26] uh
[13:27] speaks of this
[13:29] because now we have a high priest who
[13:31] can be touched
[13:33] by the feeling of our sicknesses our
[13:34] diseases our weaknesses our feebleness
[13:36] of health
[13:38] in acts chapter 5 i'm going to reference
[13:39] this very quickly just i i feel very
[13:41] sensitive to your discomfort today
[13:44] but in acts chapter 5 verses 12 to 16
[13:48] this is just to look at how god provides
[13:50] a way but the way is always christ and
[13:52] as odd as it may seem to dip yourself in
[13:54] a pool that's kind of getting wavy or
[13:55] bubbling up it says in acts chapter 5
[13:58] verses 12 to 16 that by the hands of the
[14:00] apostles there were many signs and
[14:01] wonders done among the people
[14:03] and then they're all gathered in one
[14:04] accord at solomon's porch
[14:06] and the rest durst no man joined himself
[14:08] to them but the people magnified them so
[14:11] now the believers are congregating
[14:12] together and the believers were the more
[14:14] added to the lord multitudes both the
[14:16] men and women in so much that they
[14:19] brought forth the sick into the streets
[14:21] and laid them on beds and couches
[14:24] that the least the shadow that at the
[14:27] least the shadow of peter passing by
[14:29] might overshadow some of them
[14:32] so they were such signs and wonders
[14:34] being done that people were laying the
[14:35] diseased in the way so that the shadow
[14:38] of a believer passing over them would
[14:40] bring them healing
[14:42] and this being attested to and believed
[14:44] that the shadow of peter healed many he
[14:46] says there came also multitudes out of
[14:47] the cities round about under jerusalem
[14:49] bringing sick folks and them which were
[14:51] vexed with unclean spirits and they were
[14:53] healed everyone amen
[14:55] by what the power of christ peter says
[14:57] this isn't by my power it wasn't by
[14:59] their own ability it wasn't necessarily
[15:01] the shadow but by faith in the finished
[15:03] work and the faith that was being lifted
[15:05] up by the lives of these believers
[15:07] in acts chapter 19 verses 11 and 12 and
[15:10] god wrought special miracles by the
[15:11] hands of paul
[15:12] so that from his body were brought unto
[15:14] the sick
[15:16] handkerchiefs are aprons
[15:18] and the diseases departed from them and
[15:20] the evil spirits went out of them
[15:22] it may seem odd to take a prayer cloth
[15:24] that may seem odd to take something
[15:25] that's been prayed over but yet this is
[15:28] something that god
[15:30] allows to be memorialized in scripture
[15:32] and they were taking things that had
[15:34] been anointed by or wore or associated
[15:36] with paul
[15:37] and god is using this and their faith in
[15:40] it to cause the diseases to part from
[15:43] people to depart from people and evil
[15:45] spirits to go out of them
[15:47] this kind of circles back to this odd
[15:49] element of a pull being stirred
[15:52] and bringing healing but yet we see a
[15:54] pattern that god can use whatever he
[15:56] wants
[15:57] but then it ought to be god that gets
[15:58] the glory
[16:00] it didn't it didn't start a cult of just
[16:03] shadow healing
[16:04] it doesn't start a cult of only
[16:06] handkerchief healing but just ways that
[16:09] god healed
[16:10] now picking back up in john chapter 5
[16:13] verse 5 and a certain man was there this
[16:14] is now
[16:16] with that background of the
[16:18] waters being troubled there's a man
[16:19] there who wants to be healed that's why
[16:21] he is there which had an infirmity 30
[16:23] and eight years
[16:25] when jesus saw him lie and knew so he's
[16:28] laying there and knew that he had been
[16:29] now a long time in that case he said to
[16:31] him now there's no this is there's no
[16:33] prompting jesus is taking his own
[16:35] initiative will thou be made whole
[16:38] i'd like to come back to that phrase
[16:39] will that be made whole
[16:40] it says the impotent man inside impotent
[16:42] means to be weak to be feeble
[16:45] to be powerless it means to be sick he
[16:46] was he was sick he answered him sir i
[16:50] have no man when the water is troubled
[16:52] to put me into the pool but while i'm
[16:53] coming
[16:55] another step down before me
[16:57] now notice how he says sir a lot of
[17:00] places in the interactions that jesus
[17:02] has with jews
[17:03] and even gentiles there's a lord master
[17:06] rabbi there's ways that they refer to
[17:08] him here it's just a simple sir we find
[17:10] from reading further that he didn't know
[17:11] who was standing before him
[17:13] he didn't know who was actually asking
[17:16] and if you could if you could let this
[17:18] kind of resonate with you and i don't
[17:20] want to take time to amplify it today
[17:22] but this really identifies the
[17:24] stubbornness of god's grace
[17:27] that this person didn't even know who he
[17:29] was wasn't even wanting someone like kim
[17:31] to heal him but god shows up to heal him
[17:33] anyways
[17:34] and without him still as yet knowing
[17:37] that he can be healed as we read this he
[17:39] just says will you behold and he gives
[17:41] them all his objections but god heals
[17:43] them anyways
[17:45] that speaks something to me that tells
[17:47] me something about god when he has a
[17:49] when there's an election where there's a
[17:51] motive on his part where he wants to do
[17:53] something he's going to do it and you're
[17:54] not going to get any credit for it
[17:57] so he asked him will not be made whole
[18:00] to be made whole this is where this word
[18:02] uh the promise of wholeness was coming
[18:04] to me it means to be sound
[18:06] if someone is sound it's of a mine a man
[18:09] who or person who's sound in body uh
[18:11] sound in mind there's some sort of
[18:12] wholeness that means to will that be
[18:14] made whole we do you want your body to
[18:16] be restored back to its condition of
[18:18] wellness do you want to be restored to
[18:21] health
[18:24] now in jeremiah chapter 19 verse 11 i'm
[18:27] gonna have to look at this in a way that
[18:28] i can maybe cut some things out today
[18:30] for your own sake
[18:31] but it says in jeremiah chapter 19 verse
[18:34] 11 i want to use this to kind of look at
[18:35] this word whole will you be made a whole
[18:38] this is a maybe an odd scripture just to
[18:40] pull out but it says and thou shalt say
[18:42] unto them and shout thou
[18:43] and shalt say unto them thus saith the
[18:45] lord of host even so will i break this
[18:48] people in this city
[18:50] as one breaketh the potter's vessel that
[18:52] cannot be made whole again and they
[18:55] shall bury them and tough it there will
[18:57] be till there be no place to bury
[19:00] quite a message of judgment we somehow
[19:03] break into people in a city
[19:05] like one breaking a piece of pottery and
[19:07] when a piece of pottery is broken they
[19:10] know that it would be impossible
[19:12] to restore it back to a pristine perfect
[19:15] unbroken condition
[19:17] that maybe if you broke it in a few
[19:19] enough pieces and had everything there
[19:20] that maybe you could glue it back
[19:22] together but the strength would be
[19:23] compromised visually you wouldn't be
[19:25] able to repair it it's unable it could
[19:28] not be made whole again that word whole
[19:30] there is rafa could not be made rafa
[19:32] again
[19:34] which is healed
[19:35] could not be made back brought back to
[19:37] its original condition and so when it's
[19:40] speaking this it says if you break a
[19:42] potter's vessel it cannot be made healed
[19:44] again
[19:45] brokenness
[19:46] is what sickness is
[19:48] any kind of sickness or disease
[19:50] is there's a breach in uh what
[19:53] to a person when they're sick
[19:55] whatever it is whether it be bacterial
[19:57] be a virus whether it be some sort of
[19:59] disease or a cut or break there's some
[20:02] sort of breach in the wholeness and the
[20:04] completeness of that person's body
[20:07] and really they find that if you've been
[20:09] cut
[20:10] it may heal but it's never like it was
[20:12] originally
[20:14] it's never healed back pristine no
[20:17] matter what it is there's always going
[20:18] to be some compromise there in that
[20:21] wound or that search or whatever it is
[20:23] that tried to fix it they even say you
[20:25] say well uh
[20:27] you know if you're ever sick you say
[20:29] well can the body ever come back to
[20:30] exactly the way it was before with a lot
[20:33] of these illnesses you if you've been
[20:35] sick before there's some record in your
[20:37] body
[20:39] there might be the case with everything
[20:41] there might finally be able to develop a
[20:43] test and say well look at this you've
[20:44] had 467 colds
[20:47] this year no in your lifetime
[20:49] they might be able to look at white
[20:51] blood cells and do some tests and find
[20:53] that there's always a marker in your
[20:55] body just like with heart attacks they
[20:56] can look at your heart and say at some
[20:58] point in your life
[21:00] you had a heart attack well how do you
[21:01] know the heart bears the record
[21:04] and so this is the idea of being sick
[21:06] there's some wound or breach and the
[21:09] bible is saying that once there's been a
[21:10] brokenness who can ever be made whole
[21:13] again
[21:16] to be made whole implies that everything
[21:17] the sickness caused is reversed
[21:20] i mean that's what that's what you would
[21:22] want right
[21:24] if we said that while i had i had
[21:26] something
[21:27] and and and it was and it was healed it
[21:29] was made whole well something may have
[21:31] been taken away a symptom may have been
[21:33] taken away but to be made whole means
[21:35] everything that was caused is reversed
[21:38] or abolished
[21:41] now i'm gonna i'm gonna skip some things
[21:44] here in jeremiah jeremiah 33 jeremiah 8
[21:47] jeremiah 30. he's talking about bringing
[21:50] health and cure to be perfectly sound
[21:53] and whole
[21:54] and it's answering to the question of is
[21:56] there any balm in gilead
[21:58] is there not a physician here
[22:01] and so there's a theme in jeremiah that
[22:02] we're just wanting to skip through today
[22:04] uh again so we could come to the real
[22:06] real heart of where my burden's at i
[22:08] noticed it's starting to cool off a
[22:09] little bit so i don't know if brother
[22:11] judah did some technician there or
[22:13] something like that got something
[22:14] working but it feels feels like it's
[22:16] cooling off a little bit i don't know
[22:17] how long it'll last so i'm going to
[22:18] preach as fast as i can so we can get
[22:19] through this
[22:21] but as he says i will bring health and
[22:23] cure
[22:24] i'm going to bring make you perfectly
[22:26] sound and whole why because there is a
[22:29] balm in gilead
[22:30] there is a physician
[22:32] there is a way that the health can be
[22:34] recovered i will restore health under
[22:36] thee i will heal thee of thy wounds he
[22:38] says in jeremiah so christ is that
[22:40] physician that jeremiah speaks of
[22:43] his atoning blood is the balm or the
[22:45] medicine for souls that are sick and for
[22:47] bodies that are not well
[22:49] that's that's what christ is we have no
[22:51] other source we have no other remedy now
[22:54] this to me is for me personally the most
[22:56] outstanding scripture on the wholeness
[22:59] first thessalonians chapter 5 verses 23
[23:02] to 24
[23:04] and it says the very god of peace
[23:06] sanctify you holy
[23:08] and i pray god your whole spirit and
[23:11] whole soul and whole body be preserved
[23:13] blameless unto the coming of our lord
[23:15] jesus christ faithful is he that calleth
[23:17] you who also will do it
[23:21] paul is requesting that the power the
[23:24] peace of god would sanctify you
[23:26] holy which means perfect
[23:28] sanctify you perfectly complete in all
[23:30] respects
[23:32] and what i'm wanting to really emphasize
[23:34] today is how that this
[23:36] just how complete and full god intends
[23:39] this to be
[23:41] we could think well if i could just have
[23:42] one thing it would be that i don't wake
[23:44] up with arthritis in the morning if i
[23:46] could just have one thing it'd be that i
[23:47] could eat whatever i want and not gain
[23:48] weight and we could be very uh i don't
[23:51] even want to say one dimensional but
[23:52] very singular about what it would mean
[23:54] to us to experience something tremendous
[23:57] but god is saying paul is writing a way
[23:59] that god intends
[24:01] that his power would holy sanctify you
[24:04] and i pray that your whole spirit whole
[24:07] soul and whole body
[24:09] would be preserved blameless
[24:12] he's using a language to say that i want
[24:14] you to be entirely complete
[24:16] there'd be no part wanting whether body
[24:19] spirit or soul that nothing would be
[24:21] lacking and paul's you know using a
[24:23] language that brings your entire being
[24:26] into view whether you can see it or not
[24:29] not just oh i pray that god would always
[24:31] heal your physical body but that god
[24:32] would also make your mind or your spirit
[24:34] complete and that god also would
[24:36] preserve your soul blameless unto the
[24:38] coming of the lord he was saying i want
[24:39] everything body spirit and soul to be
[24:42] perfectly in harmony and let the person
[24:44] be whole
[24:46] everything working together so that you
[24:48] as an individual can be sound
[24:52] amen i i know that we can relate to this
[24:55] everything
[24:56] working together so that you as an
[24:59] individual
[25:00] can fee to can be whole
[25:04] is there not times in our lives when
[25:07] everything feels great physically but
[25:09] we're just not quite there emotionally
[25:11] ever had times when you just felt like
[25:13] you're on top of the world emotionally
[25:14] but you're broken physically
[25:16] there are times where maybe you feel
[25:18] great physically and you feel great
[25:20] in your emotions but you know
[25:21] something's troubling you in your soul
[25:23] you say that's what this means is there
[25:24] can be all these different parts
[25:26] afflicted and paul saying listen my
[25:29] prayer for you is not that we were just
[25:31] like well thank god i'm saved and that
[25:34] everything else is a complete wreck and
[25:36] there's no peace in your hearts and
[25:37] there's no wellness in your body i'm
[25:39] praying that the entire person would be
[25:42] sound
[25:42] would be at rest would be complete
[25:46] and isaiah chapter 53 verses 4 and 5
[25:49] recognize just how complete this promise
[25:51] was surely he hath borne our griefs and
[25:54] carried our sorrows where is this going
[25:55] to be
[25:57] where's our grief and sorrow we we carry
[25:59] that primarily within our the realm of
[26:01] human emotions and human spirit but he
[26:03] has borne our griefs carried our sorrows
[26:05] yet we did a steam stricken smitten of
[26:07] god and afflicted now verse five but he
[26:09] was wounded for our transgressions and
[26:11] bruised for our iniquities and the
[26:13] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[26:15] where is that that's the condition of
[26:17] the soul
[26:19] so there is there is a remedy for our
[26:21] spirits there is a remedy for our souls
[26:23] and then with his stripes we are healed
[26:26] in other words the atonement covers it
[26:28] all
[26:29] whether it be soul spirit or body there
[26:31] is a wholeness that comes into view at
[26:33] the promise of this sacrifice that
[26:36] through this sacrifice it'll bear your
[26:38] griefs and sorrows it's there for your
[26:40] spirits and for your minds it is there
[26:42] for the transgressions and iniquities
[26:43] that are upon the soul that place you in
[26:46] the position of god's wrath and that's
[26:48] what the chastisement of our peace the
[26:49] price for our peace with god the peace
[26:52] in our souls is paid by this and by his
[26:54] stripes we are healed
[26:57] there's no need that the atonement does
[26:59] not meet
[27:01] and soul spirit and body to be preserved
[27:03] blameless means to undo anything wrong
[27:05] so that there is no fault
[27:08] paul's prayer is that you may be holy
[27:09] entirely perfectly in spirit soul and
[27:12] body preserve blameless in other words
[27:13] let the power of god's word make it be
[27:16] that there is no fault found in soul
[27:19] spirit or body
[27:22] to remove anything
[27:24] wrong with you
[27:26] to heal anything wrong in you
[27:29] that's what it speaks of
[27:31] now i'll read this we may come back to
[27:33] this wednesday night and in the sermon
[27:34] and knoweth it not says there's three
[27:36] rings three circles and i was gonna
[27:38] maybe put this in a slide for you but
[27:39] we'll save it
[27:40] for wednesday night and that's gonna
[27:42] make sure everyone comes back wednesday
[27:43] night so they can see the slide
[27:45] he said that's you this person this this
[27:47] rings you have the outering of the body
[27:48] you have the ring of the spirit and you
[27:50] have that inner part the soul he says
[27:51] that's you that's god god of the trinity
[27:53] is one and without a trinity he's not
[27:55] god he can't be manifested any other way
[27:58] and neither can you be manifested
[28:00] without being the trinity person that
[28:02] you are that's body spirit soul
[28:06] this statement's important without
[28:08] either one of them you are not complete
[28:11] without a body you're not complete
[28:12] without spirit you're not complete
[28:13] without a soul you're not complete
[28:14] you're not whole unless you have all
[28:17] three of these things if you didn't have
[28:18] a soul you'd be nothing if you didn't
[28:19] have a spirit you wouldn't be nothing
[28:21] you didn't have a body you'd be a just a
[28:23] spirit not a body
[28:25] well brother branham is identifying and
[28:27] instead of just taking this oh if one of
[28:28] these is missing then i wouldn't be
[28:30] complete if something's wrong with any
[28:32] one of these you're not complete
[28:35] you may have each one of these elements
[28:36] and oh i've got all three elements but
[28:38] from the position that paul approaches
[28:40] it that you have a spirit you have a you
[28:42] have a body you have a spirit you have a
[28:44] soul that's from out working in if you
[28:46] work from the in out it's soul spirit
[28:47] body in those three rings brethren says
[28:50] without any one of those you're not a
[28:51] person so if god desires that you as a
[28:54] person would be whole then it speaks to
[28:57] the wholeness of body spirit and soul
[29:01] and not just a well body all the days of
[29:04] your life in a troubled mind or a well
[29:06] body and a well-mind and a troubled soul
[29:08] it speaks to soul spirit and body being
[29:12] whole
[29:13] and so the promise of healing in the
[29:16] atonement relates to the full redemption
[29:19] of soul spirit and body
[29:22] the promise of wholeness
[29:24] it's the promise of soundness i think
[29:26] you're having a sound mind
[29:28] a sound body
[29:29] a sound soul it's completeness
[29:32] if any one of them is out of kilter
[29:34] you're not whole
[29:37] so it's talking about continuity again i
[29:38] think this is where
[29:40] we can fellowship in this a little bit
[29:41] we can all tell our own stories of how
[29:43] that we know when something's not right
[29:46] even in our physical bodies we know when
[29:48] some something just doesn't feel right
[29:50] so it's a in the physical part there's
[29:53] one member that's just a little bit out
[29:55] of joint or painful and how that works
[29:58] to make you feel well this isn't right
[30:00] so the rest isn't right
[30:02] isn't that the way some of us think that
[30:04] the way it is now is the way that it's
[30:05] always been and the way that it'll
[30:07] always will be
[30:08] and there's times when we're sick and we
[30:10] can't remember what it was like to not
[30:12] be sick
[30:13] and it's really hard for us to remember
[30:14] what it's going to be like when we're
[30:15] not sick
[30:17] or there's been pain that we've lived
[30:18] with our whole lives or something we've
[30:20] always just been dealing with and we've
[30:21] dealt with it so long we don't know what
[30:23] it's like to be without that
[30:26] and so we kind of approach it with every
[30:28] day well this is just how it is and
[30:30] you're just not able to compartmentalize
[30:32] and say well uh why don't why your
[30:34] back's not hurting you know is it fine
[30:36] no i just kind of i've just cut that
[30:38] part out
[30:39] you know that part doesn't bother me
[30:41] anymore no if it's wherever it is if one
[30:43] part of the body suffers the bible says
[30:45] every part does
[30:47] and so to have wholeness is there some
[30:50] sort of harmony and union and and
[30:52] there's some sort of togetherness and
[30:54] that would mean just with respect to all
[30:56] the elements of your physical body all
[30:58] the elements of your spirit and that of
[31:00] your soul but then also soul spirit and
[31:02] body also together being harmonized in
[31:05] the union of all parts
[31:08] now
[31:09] i want to focus on this part today
[31:12] on
[31:13] redemption or so the atonement
[31:16] healing in the atonement speaks of
[31:18] redemption of the entire person
[31:20] so let's look at the soul for a while
[31:23] salvation which is to be saved and i
[31:25] know that there's a a word that is used
[31:27] regarding saved
[31:30] that we could kind of use as this i
[31:32] don't know it's just it's man's
[31:33] invention really just to try to
[31:35] categorize people
[31:37] saved but not saved is really what it is
[31:40] right because it's like oh they're saved
[31:43] from what absolutely nothing until it's
[31:46] all sorted out before white throne
[31:47] judgment
[31:49] right when they're actually judged
[31:50] according to their works and get in
[31:52] another way so there's a category that
[31:54] we use to talk about people who've made
[31:55] professions
[31:57] who believe that they're saved and even
[31:59] to maybe categorize people for the sake
[32:01] of of numbers when we pass out bibles
[32:03] and have people read the sinner's prayer
[32:05] and but that's not what the bible speaks
[32:07] of salvation true and complete is to be
[32:09] saved and that is the permanent healing
[32:13] of your soul
[32:16] to be saved is the permanent healing of
[32:18] your soul
[32:19] your body can get
[32:20] healed you can get sick and get well you
[32:22] can be sick be healed to get sick again
[32:25] but if the soul is ever saved it never
[32:27] gets sin thick again
[32:30] now this is i want to zero in on this
[32:33] and kind of uh may hopefully magnify
[32:35] some things today because i believe this
[32:37] is an important element to receive
[32:38] physical healing
[32:40] if this was a a mixed congregation today
[32:43] where we were having a convention and
[32:44] people were invited from all over the
[32:46] valley and there's people from different
[32:47] denominations and out of the world and
[32:49] there's people from all over that were
[32:50] here that maybe we could preach on
[32:52] divine heal and in such a way that would
[32:54] kind of cast the net and get people to
[32:56] believe in that moment to receive their
[32:58] healing but i know i'm standing before
[33:01] not rookies but veteran believers of the
[33:03] message of the hour people who've had an
[33:05] experience with god and find yet through
[33:08] all their experiences and all the power
[33:10] that they've witnessed that in the time
[33:12] that they've spent in the word of god it
[33:14] seems as if miracles are further out of
[33:17] a reach now than they were the day in
[33:19] the early days of your salvation
[33:22] so what we're wanting to come back to is
[33:24] what those early days meant
[33:27] and go back to just how real that was
[33:30] because that's what we tend to lose
[33:32] connection with the most important thing
[33:35] and we're living out here on our own
[33:37] thinking it's our shadow that's going to
[33:38] heal somebody when peter was so closely
[33:41] connected with the power of christ it
[33:43] was so vivid what he had done on the day
[33:45] of pentecost that peter was never going
[33:47] to be mistaken by his shadow having the
[33:49] power to heal
[33:52] so this important element to receive
[33:54] your the healing of your body is to look
[33:55] at this permanent healing of our souls
[33:57] so the new birth we could say in this
[33:59] way and i think this is where there's a
[34:00] lot of connection to where we want to be
[34:01] on wednesday night
[34:02] is it changes the nature of the soul or
[34:05] the soul is regenerated to newness of
[34:07] life
[34:08] eternal life it is the perfecting of the
[34:10] soul
[34:11] when you're baptized with the holy ghost
[34:12] it resolves the sin question there's no
[34:14] more sin allocated to your soul it's no
[34:16] longer the judge it's no longer under
[34:18] the uh the penalty of death guarantees
[34:20] you the resurrection
[34:22] and therefore there is this permanence
[34:25] that relates to when that soul is sealed
[34:27] it is permanently healed
[34:30] brother braham says come see come out
[34:31] salvation come see the greatest miracle
[34:33] of all christ to change the sinner's
[34:36] heart
[34:37] that's the greatest remember this that's
[34:39] the greatest miracle of all
[34:41] second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any
[34:43] man be in christ he's a new creature
[34:46] old things are passed away behold all
[34:47] things are become new
[34:49] this is no small thing
[34:53] i know it maybe have some kind of
[34:56] mystical quality to it and it seems like
[34:58] by one spear we're all baptized into one
[35:00] body and we realize that that baptism is
[35:02] not even the water baptism it's a
[35:03] spiritual baptism that body we can't
[35:05] necessarily put our hands on it and
[35:07] there's people that we thought for sure
[35:08] were part of it and they're no longer
[35:09] part of it and so there's a way that we
[35:11] just kind of think well this is just
[35:12] kind of in the ether somewhere but this
[35:14] is very real and it's no small thing
[35:17] that when a person's soul is changed
[35:19] they become a new creature
[35:22] remember in the ecstasy or the augmented
[35:24] reality old things are passed away all
[35:27] things become new because now there's an
[35:29] entirely new life that's in the control
[35:32] tower of the person and it has a way of
[35:35] viewing everything differently than ever
[35:37] could have been viewed before by you so
[35:39] that all things becoming new is speaking
[35:42] about this unfolding process of the life
[35:45] that is in you
[35:46] all things are becoming new
[35:48] by the newness that is in that spirit
[35:50] the newness of life bill abraham said
[35:52] it's the greatest miracle that ever
[35:53] happened when a man or woman is born
[35:55] again of the spirit of god and becomes a
[35:56] new creature in christ jesus
[35:59] what is it it's that word birth that
[36:01] seals our souls
[36:03] this is the greatest healing
[36:06] and we need to i think it's very very
[36:08] important that we recognize this
[36:10] that if your soul is sealed that is the
[36:13] greatest miracle
[36:15] and that we we we need to recognize this
[36:18] and there needs to be some
[36:20] embracing of it
[36:22] laying a hole when the bible talks about
[36:24] laying hold of eternal life we could get
[36:26] in our minds and this is kind of the
[36:27] this is the leaven that's associated
[36:29] with the wrong kind of teaching when it
[36:30] comes to salvation
[36:32] uh i think there's a phrase within kind
[36:34] of upc or pentecost assembly of gods
[36:36] that once saved always saved is a
[36:37] man-made doctrine
[36:39] and and i would maybe agree with them if
[36:41] it's the once saved always saved the
[36:44] little s and the reason why they hold to
[36:46] that is because they believe that
[36:47] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[36:49] the holy ghost and that very one who
[36:51] spoke in tongues and had the holy ghost
[36:52] can go right out and say you guys are a
[36:54] bunch of devils and i'm gonna i'm gonna
[36:56] go do this i'm gonna go do that they're
[36:57] like they lost it right
[36:59] so the dominoes started falling with the
[37:01] wrong uh evidence of the holy ghost and
[37:03] so there's a way that we teach what
[37:05] saved is
[37:06] and this sense that well i have eternal
[37:09] life and you're saved and you have
[37:10] eternal life and
[37:12] and you're part of the body of christ
[37:13] you're a son or daughter of god you are
[37:15] saved but now you got to prove yourself
[37:18] to become bride material which the holy
[37:20] ghost is going to make you right
[37:22] it's kind of the way that it can be
[37:23] taught well that's just not how it is at
[37:25] all otherwise you have
[37:27] genuine sons and daughters of god who
[37:29] possess eternal life who don't go in the
[37:31] resurrection or the rapture
[37:33] left over for tribulation have to stand
[37:36] before white judgment and god's like
[37:38] so sorry how did i miss you
[37:41] sorry sorry you had eternal life and you
[37:43] had to go through all that i tell you
[37:45] what we'll upgrade you
[37:47] i'll give you one more night free how's
[37:49] that how about a couple bottles of water
[37:51] will that take care of your problem
[37:52] serve the tribulation
[37:54] that's not how it works
[37:56] if you are saved you have eternal life
[37:58] now to lay hold of eternal life is to
[38:01] become intimately familiar
[38:04] with what you have
[38:06] and to never let go of the greatest
[38:08] miracle of all
[38:11] the soul to be changed for a person be
[38:13] changed that is the greatest miracle and
[38:15] the sermon fellowship brother bam says
[38:17] the greatest miracle ever performed when
[38:18] god can take something and convert it
[38:20] and bring it back to itself again
[38:22] just the same as you could take an
[38:24] animal by science and drop a little drop
[38:25] of water on top of a hog and make it a
[38:27] lamb
[38:29] i i you know science is pretty
[38:31] phenomenal and it wouldn't surprise me
[38:33] if they came up with some potion
[38:35] that would make a pig look like a lamb
[38:37] right and just drop drop look what we've
[38:40] done
[38:41] but he says
[38:42] now that's the greatest miracle of it
[38:45] changes whole nature appetites attitudes
[38:48] everything
[38:49] that's what god does when he saves a man
[38:51] from sin
[38:52] he changes his entire makeup
[38:56] so greater miracle than any part of
[38:58] divine healing that i've ever seen
[39:02] and brother braham says and i by the
[39:03] grace of god i've seen pretty near
[39:05] everything that i could ever think of
[39:06] and hear of done by our lord jesus even
[39:08] the raisin of the dead after they were
[39:09] gone
[39:11] so this is this is pretty valid if you
[39:13] ask some of us and say well what's the
[39:14] greatest miracle you've ever seen you're
[39:15] kind of like well the only one
[39:18] me
[39:19] right that may be true for some of us
[39:22] the only miracle we may know is this
[39:23] what he's talking about or we may have
[39:25] seen somebody else heal but brother
[39:26] branham's got quite the testimony of how
[39:29] the power of god
[39:31] and he says the greatest miracle he's
[39:33] ever seen even beyond raising the dead i
[39:36] still think that salvation is the
[39:38] greatest miracle
[39:42] so if you take all the divine healings
[39:43] that ever were in the world and weighed
[39:45] them they cannot by quantity ever out
[39:49] qualify
[39:51] the salvation of even one soul
[39:55] he's saying this is the greatest miracle
[39:57] of all and i say it's not even close
[40:00] it's not like the greatest miracle you
[40:02] know it's got 59 votes for uh number one
[40:05] and there's three votes for number two
[40:07] it's it's not even close
[40:09] you couldn't even do it top ten it's all
[40:12] salvation of the soul it's it's the list
[40:14] there's nothing else outside of it it's
[40:16] the greatest miracle of all
[40:19] even took the greatest gift outside of
[40:21] this it's not even divine healing
[40:24] right
[40:27] so i want to i want to say this
[40:30] because this kind of forms this
[40:32] hoping this word can kind of hit these
[40:33] things that hinder our healing
[40:35] if the greatest miracle god ever did is
[40:38] the salvation of the soul then we ought
[40:40] to never let sickness discourage us
[40:44] should never let physical seal sickness
[40:46] no matter how bad the diagnosis may be
[40:50] or the prognosis be
[40:52] uh well this is permanent death or this
[40:54] is going to be death and it's it's a
[40:56] stage four and you're there's no hope
[40:57] for you that's why i think i've
[40:59] encouraged it before if there's
[41:00] something wrong or there's a symptom
[41:02] don't google it because we know how it
[41:03] ends
[41:04] you can scroll forever but the last line
[41:06] is always you have cancer you're going
[41:08] to die
[41:09] that that's what everything ends in is
[41:12] cancer and death
[41:14] and so no matter what it is we should
[41:16] never let
[41:18] symptoms sickness circumstances
[41:20] diagnosis uh the the prospects of life
[41:24] for the quality of life as we near near
[41:26] the termination of our life we should
[41:28] never let that overwhelm the glory in
[41:30] our soul
[41:32] that there ought to be something
[41:34] radiating so brilliantly from our souls
[41:37] that no matter what the condition may be
[41:39] of body and mind there's just something
[41:41] about that that hey i'm laying hold of
[41:44] eternal life and this overshadows all
[41:47] the suffering i could ever have in my
[41:49] mind and body the glory of the in my
[41:52] soul is going to outweigh the glory in
[41:55] my body and my mind this is what we draw
[41:58] from scripture that all the things that
[42:00] you suffer every single circumstance
[42:03] symptom every instance of suffering
[42:05] whether it be in body or mind it is
[42:07] always pregnant
[42:10] amen
[42:11] it's always pregnant with glory
[42:14] because that's what that's the only
[42:16] thing that's going to come from your
[42:18] suffering is the greater glory as paul
[42:20] talks about it so we ought to never let
[42:22] these things discourage us and it's in
[42:24] this that i believe that the holy spirit
[42:26] is wanting to address the things that
[42:28] hinder us from receiving our healing
[42:30] because you take somebody who in the
[42:31] right place in their soul has the glory
[42:34] of god residing within them and then
[42:36] they begin to suffer sickness and what
[42:38] they do is immediately let they let that
[42:41] flip things around and reorder their
[42:44] thought process to where now eternal
[42:46] life is out of the picture and they're
[42:48] hyper focused on their physical
[42:50] condition
[42:53] that's a state that only the saved can
[42:55] be in
[42:58] this is this is uh
[42:59] kind of taking all those statements
[43:01] where brethren says i've seen a ranked
[43:02] center come across the platform and be
[43:03] healed but a believer come by and not be
[43:05] healed and remember we walk through this
[43:06] wednesday night
[43:08] and we're identifying why it's so hard
[43:10] for people like us sometimes to receive
[43:12] our healing and just back up a little
[43:13] bit and realize why it's so important
[43:15] that we write this ship a little bit and
[43:17] we get this in order because we're going
[43:19] to have to have power not just to take
[43:20] away a toothache but change our body
[43:23] and if we're getting upside down and all
[43:25] confused and discombobulated with
[43:26] respect to a little physical pain and
[43:28] we're not living within that soul realm
[43:30] then we need to get things back in
[43:31] balance
[43:33] paul says in second corinthians chapter
[43:35] 4 verse 7 but we have this treasure in
[43:36] earth and vessels that the excellency of
[43:39] the power may be of god and not of us
[43:43] there is a divine excellency deposited
[43:45] in you
[43:46] he says we have this treasure it's a
[43:48] repository
[43:50] it's not it's it says we have this
[43:52] deposit we could call the deposit the
[43:54] treasure but you are the treasury
[43:58] there's this repository you are a
[44:00] repository of divine excellency
[44:04] this is something we should ought to
[44:06] never forget brother brahm said in the
[44:08] message perseverance i don't know if i
[44:09] provided this statement
[44:11] but
[44:12] because it's so easy for us to live
[44:16] below what we are
[44:18] the order's been kind of turned upside
[44:20] down
[44:20] brother brahman says god has done
[44:22] something for you
[44:24] he saved you
[44:26] that's the greatest miracle there is
[44:30] there's got to be a recalibration of
[44:31] self-worth
[44:33] there's got to be we have to get a um
[44:36] i know sometimes when it comes to
[44:37] insurance you have to get something
[44:38] revalued you have to get it appraised
[44:40] and you have to get this appraised or
[44:41] coach comes time to buy something there
[44:43] has to be appraisal of the value and of
[44:45] its worth i think it's time for us to
[44:46] get a spiritual appraisal of our worth
[44:49] we've lost connection with it we're
[44:50] trying to you want to look at your
[44:52] blessed assurance policy you need to
[44:54] look at the appraisal that's attached
[44:55] with it
[44:56] you kind of look at the value that god
[44:58] has placed upon you and it's just so
[45:00] easy for us to live distant from our
[45:02] actual value but we have this treasure
[45:04] and earth and vessels that we have
[45:06] divine excellency deposited in us that's
[45:09] why paul begins to go down in the next
[45:10] several verses that's why we're we're
[45:13] cast down but not in despair we're this
[45:14] but we're not forsaken we're this but
[45:16] we're not well i said there may be a lot
[45:17] of things this way but when you look at
[45:19] it there's no way we can ever be lost we
[45:21] could ever be forsaken we should ever be
[45:23] in despair because of the value and the
[45:25] worth of what you have deposited inside
[45:28] of you
[45:30] you say oh god's never done anything for
[45:32] me or god hasn't done something for me
[45:33] in this and this is suffering and that
[45:35] is suffering and we begin to wonder has
[45:36] god forsaken me has god ever done
[45:38] anything god has done something for you
[45:40] he saved you that's the greatest miracle
[45:43] there is
[45:45] there needs to be a reordering of the
[45:47] graces there needs to be a reordering of
[45:48] the privileges so often we are jealous
[45:51] or we envy those who are blessed
[45:52] financially we envy those who are
[45:54] blessed with great physiques we envy
[45:56] those who experience divine healing we
[45:57] experience those who experience these
[46:00] great restorations out of terrible
[46:01] trials and we're failing to value
[46:05] what god has done for us in our soul
[46:07] he's done something for you he saved you
[46:10] and i'll say one of the biggest traps
[46:12] some of our young people can fall into
[46:14] is how we often take the most depraved
[46:17] individual's testimony and put it on a
[46:19] pedestal of how remarkable god's grace
[46:21] is and we say look at the healing that
[46:23] god did in this person's life look at
[46:25] the salvation that god did in this
[46:26] person's life but we do not echo the
[46:29] value of god's healing power to preserve
[46:32] and keep those who never make it on that
[46:34] pedestal there's got to be a reappraisal
[46:37] of graces or reappraisal of privileges
[46:40] what god is granting our families today
[46:43] is of the greatest value
[46:45] to not have to spend a moment in the
[46:47] world
[46:50] i take a testimony of somebody that says
[46:52] well
[46:52] i've been healed of cancer 476 times
[46:56] is that how many times we've had colds
[46:58] this year i don't know why there's maybe
[46:59] some spiritual about four six seven six
[47:02] but and then you take somebody says you
[47:04] know
[47:05] i i haven't i haven't been sick for
[47:07] years and
[47:08] god i've just god kept me in great
[47:10] health and we've got this we got this
[47:12] family problem where
[47:14] everybody in my family has died of heart
[47:15] attacks by 60 and here i'm 76 years old
[47:18] never had a heart problem at all and
[47:19] we're coming
[47:20] okay yeah what about this person who has
[47:22] cancer set 476 times
[47:24] you don't think god's in this
[47:26] you don't think god's in your wellness
[47:28] you don't think god's you should every
[47:30] night you should thank god for if you're
[47:31] healthy right now you should thank god
[47:32] for it
[47:34] if you're paying the bills you should
[47:36] thank god for it
[47:41] but if he saved you
[47:42] that's the greatest miracle there is
[47:45] have we not been reading a lot from luke
[47:46] chapter 10 i guess maybe not a lot we've
[47:49] made reference to it he says i've given
[47:50] you power to tread on serpents and
[47:51] scorpions and the power of the enemy
[47:53] nothing shall by any means hurt you says
[47:55] but you know what in this rejoice not
[47:57] because spirits are subject to you
[47:59] but rejoice because your names are
[48:01] written in heaven
[48:03] that's where the rejoicing is
[48:05] that's where the glory is
[48:07] we don't glory in the fact that we were
[48:09] now i want to i want to say this and
[48:11] then back it up with another statement
[48:13] we don't glory in that we were sick
[48:16] physically and then now well we glory in
[48:18] the salvation of our souls
[48:22] because if you diminish the power of our
[48:23] salvation it limits the power it limits
[48:25] the power of your faith
[48:27] if you diminish the power and the glory
[48:29] of your salvation it's going to limit
[48:32] the effectiveness of your faith
[48:35] because it's a
[48:36] there's a consciousness to your faith
[48:39] that knows when you're no longer
[48:41] operating by faith because with because
[48:44] there's an improper assessment
[48:47] you put too much worth and value on the
[48:49] soundness of your mind and body
[48:51] and not enough on the soundness of your
[48:54] soul
[48:55] and therefore faith cannot even in
[48:57] desperation
[48:59] act to change the circumstances of mind
[49:02] and body because it's kind of like wait
[49:04] as brother randy snow likes to say hey
[49:05] what am i chop liver
[49:07] huh why don't you ever call me right
[49:09] there's like i'm down here and i'm very
[49:11] very real
[49:13] and i'm very very powerful but you've
[49:15] somehow gotten all hyper fixated on all
[49:17] these other things and it's not from
[49:20] here from a good place from a powerful
[49:22] place that you're trying to operate your
[49:24] faith but you're in a compromised
[49:26] position somehow and by diminishing the
[49:28] glory of the salvation of our soul we
[49:31] have limited the effectiveness
[49:34] of our faith in our spirits and bodies
[49:38] in the sermon the uncertain sound
[49:39] brother bram says anything that's
[49:40] uncertain is
[49:42] unreliable and so in days of this time
[49:45] when they're not certain whether jesus
[49:46] is the same yesterday today and forever
[49:48] leave the thing alone
[49:51] i think that applies to any promise of
[49:53] god it was the theme of brethren's
[49:54] ministry in healing he's the same
[49:56] yesterday today and forever
[49:59] you can be certain
[50:01] amen where's your certainty
[50:03] you can know it to be
[50:05] that if it never performs any more
[50:07] miracle on you but the great miracle
[50:09] forgives your
[50:10] sins you can be certain
[50:14] if he never performs any other miracle
[50:17] on you but he has forgiven your sins
[50:20] which the seal of is the holy ghost then
[50:22] you can be certain
[50:24] oh if i could just have this happen i'll
[50:26] be certain oh if i could just have this
[50:27] happen i could be certain oh if i could
[50:28] have this happen i can be servant uh
[50:30] certain well if you've never been saved
[50:32] that sounds a lot like you've not been
[50:34] saved but if you have been saved there's
[50:36] a faith down on the inside saying wait a
[50:38] minute i'm pretty sure about this
[50:40] wait a minute i'm pretty sure about this
[50:42] wanting you to get out of your own mind
[50:44] let the mind of christ have preeminence
[50:46] to say this i know
[50:49] this i can be certain of that god has
[50:52] done something for me this i can be
[50:55] certain of he is the same yesterday
[50:57] today and forever well have you ever
[50:59] seen him raise the dead have you ever
[51:00] had a limb restored have you ever had
[51:02] tonsils grow back miraculously nope
[51:04] never had it then how can you know i can
[51:06] be certain because this soul which was
[51:08] as black as night has been regenerated
[51:11] into life and in delight and i can be
[51:14] certain he is the same yesterday today
[51:16] and forever
[51:20] that's the greatest miracle that god
[51:22] ever performed was to forgive a human
[51:23] being it's sins
[51:27] now he amplifies it take a man and
[51:28] convert him from the things
[51:30] look
[51:31] that's changed his innermost being not
[51:34] his body and his mind necessary but his
[51:35] innermost being
[51:37] from the things that he once drank and
[51:38] gambled and done evil and things like
[51:40] that and all of a sudden turns him right
[51:42] back around to love
[51:44] goes home to his wife and says honey i'm
[51:45] sorry that i've treated you like that
[51:48] picks up his little children hold them
[51:49] in his arms in the arm
[51:51] daddy spent all his money for whiskey
[51:53] daddy's done this and mother's been out
[51:54] all night long and left you chilled and
[51:56] i'll never do it again god forgive me
[51:58] and how that testimony
[52:00] that one
[52:02] of the greatest things that's one of the
[52:03] greatest things there is
[52:07] all the alcoholics anonymous
[52:09] didn't know they were in his
[52:11] target
[52:12] all the alcoholics anonymous and all
[52:14] like that can never change like that can
[52:17] they can never do
[52:19] they can never do for the person
[52:22] all the steps all the programs all the
[52:24] disciplines all the ways even all the
[52:26] uh the the ways that they try to use
[52:29] other substances to wean you off of bad
[52:31] substances
[52:33] all the things that they may try to do
[52:37] all the clinics can never do what god
[52:40] can do
[52:42] it's the greatest miracle again i'm
[52:43] addressing the barriers to your healing
[52:45] as a sealed believer
[52:47] brother braham of the sermon hear him he
[52:48] says you've never seen a miracle you say
[52:49] i i've never
[52:51] so before you see anything come accept
[52:54] christ first
[52:55] then you'll be in position to accept
[52:57] miracles and things when you see the
[52:58] lame walk in the blind sea
[53:01] is that so then is that not the position
[53:03] we ought to remain in
[53:05] oh you've never seen a miracle he's
[53:06] saying well then he's not just saying
[53:08] well come look at this
[53:09] so how about you just accept christ
[53:14] because because the miracles aren't the
[53:15] great thing they're not the important
[53:17] thing
[53:18] i'm anymore just slight of hand is a
[53:20] miracle to people like how did they do
[53:21] that and they literally believe they did
[53:22] that like wow this is amazing
[53:25] these people can levitate they can make
[53:26] the statue of liberty disappear
[53:28] and there's all sorts of things that
[53:29] they in their minds believe has happened
[53:31] and they don't realize no there's just a
[53:32] lot of money spent on this
[53:34] it's all angles
[53:36] smoking mirrors as it were
[53:38] i said no if you've never seen a miracle
[53:41] it's not about the show of a miracle
[53:42] it's about christ
[53:44] so he says accept christ first that's
[53:46] what it's all about anyways and once you
[53:48] accept christ i believe he's talking
[53:49] about the person of christ coming into
[53:51] you then you'll be in the position
[53:53] it says to accept miracles
[53:56] for yourself
[53:58] when you see miracles
[54:00] or be able to agree with them and accept
[54:02] them when you see the lame walk in the
[54:03] blind say you're in a position to accept
[54:05] that is the power of god what's the main
[54:08] thing the salvation of the soul
[54:11] so the sermon preparation he says how do
[54:13] you take a sinner like me and like you
[54:15] and making christian out of us i can't
[54:17] understand it
[54:18] that's the greatest miracle that god
[54:20] ever performed is when he took a sinner
[54:22] and made a christian out of us
[54:24] you believe that god can save anybody
[54:25] from sin because you've been taught that
[54:29] he says well
[54:30] that's a far more of a miracle
[54:32] that man that was dead and trespasses in
[54:35] sin that man is dead and he had to
[54:37] believe or remain dead
[54:41] i'll let this sink in i'm hoping that
[54:43] this really really just
[54:44] has the impact then after you were born
[54:46] again you become a son of god
[54:49] how much more ought you to believe for a
[54:51] lesser miracle
[54:55] for divine healing
[54:57] if a live man ought to believe more than
[54:59] a dead man
[55:02] see what i mean
[55:04] you've got to believe it can't explain
[55:05] it believe it that's all you have to do
[55:08] who's he speaking to
[55:10] not the dead prostitutes that somehow in
[55:13] their dead state can come and receive
[55:15] divine healing he's talking to those of
[55:18] us who have had our natures changed and
[55:21] god has performed on us the greatest
[55:23] miracle but somehow through all our
[55:26] knowledge and our ups and downs and all
[55:28] of our experiences we've somehow made
[55:30] the healing of this so much bigger than
[55:33] the healing of this
[55:35] and we've let what can be seen and felt
[55:38] and recorded and prescribed and
[55:40] diagnosed loomed so much larger than the
[55:43] fact that god has healed us of the
[55:45] sickness and our of sin in our souls and
[55:48] is liberated from death and he says if
[55:50] you can believe that how much more are
[55:53] you to believe for a lesser miracle
[55:56] of divine healing
[55:59] if your sins have been forgiven you and
[56:02] you know that you have the holy ghost
[56:05] then how much more are you this is not
[56:07] this is not in any way sarcastic this is
[56:10] in no way uh spanking it's it's just
[56:12] kind of like
[56:13] oh whoa hello yeah he's like hey you
[56:17] know if you could do this
[56:19] i mean you can that's better that's
[56:21] greater
[56:23] how much more ought to be believe
[56:25] for a lesser miracle of divine healing
[56:28] how much more should a living people
[56:30] believe more than dead people
[56:34] this whole series on christ my healer is
[56:36] about placing our faith in christ for
[56:37] all things
[56:39] it's a it's a centering our faith on him
[56:42] what what the true basis of healing is
[56:45] and the sermon demonology in the
[56:47] physical realm
[56:49] and i think that's a title that kind of
[56:50] speaks to how these things can even work
[56:52] he says how could a person on that
[56:54] estate
[56:56] and that condition i'm not a believer
[56:58] and i'm using this maybe out of the
[56:59] context here but to refer to a pers
[57:01] person whose soul is sealed
[57:04] eternally permanently healed
[57:07] says how can a person in that condition
[57:08] ever be sick
[57:12] maybe that's the devil the that's the
[57:13] statement the devil makes to us
[57:16] yeah i mean uh
[57:17] how could he be saved and cron and but
[57:19] still be chronically sick huh
[57:22] right is that the voice the devil uses
[57:25] with you
[57:27] to me it's garrison keeler's cigarette
[57:29] demon he used to
[57:31] use years ago i need a cigarette i need
[57:33] a cigarette
[57:34] but this is what he's like
[57:36] how is it that i
[57:38] i can be sealed in this condition and
[57:40] ever get sick he says because your
[57:42] body's not redeemed
[57:44] yet
[57:46] okay
[57:48] all right
[57:49] makes sense
[57:51] your body's not redeemed no matter how
[57:53] much how good you are how saintly how
[57:54] holy how much holy spirit that's only
[57:57] your soul
[57:59] and a very simple statement which i
[58:01] think is just stating the obvious for
[58:02] all of us our soul is fully redeemed
[58:05] future home where are we eight they
[58:06] already in our souls
[58:08] and he's saying but yet the body is not
[58:11] redeemed yet
[58:13] though it may go through cycles of the
[58:15] types of redemption
[58:17] in healing it is not yet redeemed so he
[58:20] is clarifying why sickness comes on a
[58:23] believer
[58:24] this is the clarification how can you
[58:26] say you have eternal life in your soul
[58:27] you have the power of god down in your
[58:29] soul but you still get sick in mind or
[58:31] body how can that be well the clear
[58:33] answer is mind and body are not yet
[58:35] fully redeemed so that clarifies why a
[58:38] believer can still get sick but more
[58:40] importantly if i could say it this way
[58:43] it's he is by putting it this way he's
[58:46] not just trying to clarify why we can
[58:48] still get sick
[58:49] but he's trying to place our faith on
[58:51] where the real power is
[58:54] where do we put our confidence not in
[58:56] that i've got a body that's impervious
[58:58] to viral infections and not that i've
[59:00] got a body that will never get a
[59:01] bacterial illness
[59:02] that's not where it is at all it's not
[59:04] that i've got a spirit that's locked in
[59:05] i got locked in at this great really
[59:07] great uh satisfaction rate locked in
[59:11] no matter what happens up or down i'm
[59:13] locked in
[59:14] i'm happy with me
[59:15] you know
[59:17] this is fine i'm locked in i can't go
[59:19] any lower i can't go any higher and it's
[59:21] not that at all what he's wanting us to
[59:23] realize is wait a minute i have a body
[59:25] that can still get sick
[59:26] i have a spirit that can still get
[59:28] discouraged
[59:29] but i got a soul
[59:31] they can't get sick
[59:33] i got a i got a soul that doesn't get
[59:35] sad
[59:37] i got a soul that doesn't get
[59:38] discouraged i got a soul that doesn't
[59:40] have a doubt since anymore
[59:42] it's impossible for my soul to doubt now
[59:46] hold up
[59:48] right
[59:50] wait a minute that changes things i'm
[59:52] gonna stop living with my faith on my
[59:55] body i'm gonna stop living with my faith
[59:57] on my spirit but i'm gonna start letting
[59:59] my faith and my soul
[1:00:01] look out at the rest of things
[1:00:05] it's a it's a way of brother i'm trying
[1:00:07] to place our faith don't sit there and
[1:00:08] say well i'm sick i'm sick well i mean i
[1:00:11] know that just happens it happens but
[1:00:12] wait a minute if your soul is sealed the
[1:00:15] body can still get sick but it's like
[1:00:17] but the soul is sealed
[1:00:19] hey
[1:00:20] it's like maybe we just well how can why
[1:00:22] is it the body can still get sick
[1:00:24] because the body's not redeemed your
[1:00:25] soul is perfectly redeemed but the
[1:00:26] body's not redeemed so with the body not
[1:00:28] being redeemed wait a minute i want to
[1:00:29] go back to something
[1:00:30] what do you say about the saul
[1:00:33] that's what the statement ought to do
[1:00:35] let's talk all day about our family
[1:00:37] medical history
[1:00:39] all right you ever go to the doctor and
[1:00:40] they want you to put down all the times
[1:00:41] you've been in the hospital what you're
[1:00:42] allergic to you're kind of like i need
[1:00:44] more ink
[1:00:46] right
[1:00:47] like they want to know everything about
[1:00:48] you and you're telling them you know
[1:00:51] that like when they're asking us about
[1:00:52] whether or not you had coveted symptoms
[1:00:54] you're kind of like are you breathing
[1:00:58] sorry sir you can't visit the infirm in
[1:01:00] this hospital because you're breathing
[1:01:02] well i could try to hold my breath
[1:01:04] and it's like everything everything was
[1:01:06] like did you wake up this morning yeah
[1:01:07] everything's like everything's a symptom
[1:01:11] and we're full of it so let's talk about
[1:01:12] it let's talk about your your symptoms
[1:01:15] let's talk about your medical history
[1:01:17] what i want you to do is take everything
[1:01:19] in your medicine cabinet
[1:01:21] everything in your pantry bring it over
[1:01:23] to my house and we're going to go
[1:01:24] through it we're going to figure out
[1:01:25] what's causing your problems
[1:01:28] and we're going to talk about what you
[1:01:29] can add it's going to fix your problems
[1:01:31] you need
[1:01:34] that's what you need you need to play in
[1:01:35] the dirt more
[1:01:37] and i would be like you know before we
[1:01:38] do that can we come back to what you
[1:01:39] just said about my soul again
[1:01:42] that's what we ought to be doing
[1:01:44] i mean listen we ought to put young
[1:01:46] living out of business
[1:01:48] right
[1:01:49] i'm not a doterra salesman either but we
[1:01:51] all these supplements and all these
[1:01:53] things we spend all our time i'm not
[1:01:54] going on a rent but maybe i am we spend
[1:01:56] all our time talking about all the
[1:01:58] supplements we can do to our mind and
[1:02:00] our body when all we need to do to
[1:02:02] supplement our mind and body is to come
[1:02:04] back to hold up wait a minute my soul is
[1:02:07] sealed my soul is healed my soul has
[1:02:11] divine power
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:18] brother bradham
[1:02:20] is trying to place our faith
[1:02:22] in the wholeness
[1:02:24] the soul is made whole the soul is
[1:02:26] perfectly healed
[1:02:28] therefore
[1:02:29] redemption power is already in you
[1:02:33] right redemption power is already in you
[1:02:37] so whenever whenever we are sick and i'm
[1:02:39] gonna spend a lot of time on this maybe
[1:02:40] in the future a lot of time may just be
[1:02:42] a sunday morning afternoon type service
[1:02:44] but that when you're sick we know that
[1:02:46] going to the doctor is perfectly fine
[1:02:49] in a matter of faith i think i might
[1:02:51] just deal with the whole idea of if i do
[1:02:53] have faith what does it look like does
[1:02:54] it mean i seek every available remedy
[1:02:56] for my disease or does it mean i do
[1:02:58] nothing
[1:02:59] right and i know these are questions we
[1:03:01] might ask ourselves
[1:03:02] and so there is there is when we are
[1:03:05] sick there's a reaching out for things
[1:03:06] that are beyond ourselves but never
[1:03:08] forget that when you are sick
[1:03:10] if you have the holy ghost redemption
[1:03:11] power is already in you
[1:03:13] and the sermon of paradox brotherhood
[1:03:15] says if you're sick i wish i could heal
[1:03:16] you but no man can do that it's already
[1:03:19] done healing lies in you it's your faith
[1:03:21] in the finished work that god did on
[1:03:22] calvary with jesus christ
[1:03:24] and outside of that there is no healing
[1:03:26] and outside of that there is no
[1:03:27] salvation no church no denomination no
[1:03:29] ritual nothing packs salvation
[1:03:32] no church no domination no ritual
[1:03:36] packs healing
[1:03:38] healing lies in you
[1:03:40] he says and works his faith expressed
[1:03:42] the healing power is in you
[1:03:44] it didn't come from the preacher
[1:03:47] it comes to you by faith
[1:03:52] following this
[1:03:53] the healing power is in you
[1:03:56] it doesn't come from the preacher
[1:03:58] it comes to you by revelation by faith
[1:04:01] but healing power is
[1:04:03] already
[1:04:04] in you
[1:04:06] and the sermon power of transformation
[1:04:08] let the holy spirit this to me just sums
[1:04:09] it up so beautifully so perfectly let
[1:04:12] the holy spirit come upon any person
[1:04:14] that's truly got something down there
[1:04:16] what's the something down there it's the
[1:04:18] something that's already there it's the
[1:04:19] something that's coming it's too
[1:04:20] omnipotence meeting it's the omnipotence
[1:04:22] of god's power divine in the soul of a
[1:04:25] saved person and in the spirit of god
[1:04:27] coming down and having to go through the
[1:04:29] channels of physical hearing and
[1:04:30] spiritually opening up to let it strike
[1:04:32] the soul let the holy spirit come upon
[1:04:34] anyone that's truly got something down
[1:04:35] there a healing comes from the inside
[1:04:39] listen believers
[1:04:41] let that healing come from the spirit
[1:04:43] that's in you
[1:04:45] if it's a genuine spirit anointing the
[1:04:47] genuine seed it can't do nothing but
[1:04:49] bear a son or daughters of god
[1:04:52] the healing is already within you when
[1:04:54] you are sick and you need healing we're
[1:04:57] not seeking a shaman we're not seeking a
[1:05:00] remedy we're not trying to find a bomb
[1:05:02] we're not trying to find a pool we're
[1:05:04] not waiting for the right cycle we
[1:05:07] believe that healing lays within us
[1:05:10] already
[1:05:12] and accept it
[1:05:15] that the healing comes from the inside
[1:05:19] healing let that healing come from the
[1:05:21] spirit that's in you
[1:05:25] i hope that i hope that has some impact
[1:05:29] let it come from what's in you
[1:05:31] healing comes from the inside healing
[1:05:33] lies in you the healing power is in you
[1:05:36] for the believer
[1:05:37] that changes it for i've got the holy
[1:05:40] ghost i've got depression and i've got
[1:05:42] back pain
[1:05:44] and so i'm
[1:05:45] externally looking for remedies
[1:05:48] right
[1:05:50] alone
[1:05:52] but when a person by faith can say i
[1:05:54] know there's power to heal on the inside
[1:05:56] of me
[1:05:58] it changes the nature by which you take
[1:06:00] a pill for chemical imbalance
[1:06:03] it changes the attitude that you have
[1:06:05] when you go to the chiropractor
[1:06:07] because you know at the end of the day
[1:06:09] you're not making your faith subject to
[1:06:11] anything else you know the healing power
[1:06:13] is going to come from within so whenever
[1:06:15] that chiropractor just says let me just
[1:06:16] do some uh ear cones on you and get all
[1:06:19] that ear wax out of your ear and that's
[1:06:20] gonna that's gonna straighten your head
[1:06:22] a little bit and that's gonna make your
[1:06:23] hips get into alignment and then
[1:06:25] obviously you walk out there with no
[1:06:26] nerve pain anymore you're not praising
[1:06:28] the virtues of ear cones you're praising
[1:06:30] the virtue of a god who said the power
[1:06:32] to heal was inside of you
[1:06:38] now i'm gonna i have a this is the last
[1:06:40] thought that i almost was gonna put my
[1:06:43] sermon title
[1:06:44] as as this because it's talking about
[1:06:46] the soul wanting us just to recognize
[1:06:48] the value of what god's done for our
[1:06:49] soul because it's the
[1:06:52] the soul
[1:06:53] has had our sins remitted
[1:06:56] for the remission of sins there's
[1:06:58] several statements in this matthew
[1:06:59] chapter 26 verse 28
[1:07:01] for this is my blood he's given the the
[1:07:04] communion for this is my blood of the
[1:07:06] new testament this wine represents the
[1:07:08] blood that he's going to shed the blood
[1:07:10] of the new covenant which was shed for
[1:07:12] he says the remission of sins
[1:07:15] so when he shed his blood and in the
[1:07:18] shedding of his blood we know that there
[1:07:19] was atonement for body spirit soul he's
[1:07:22] saying this is the shedding of my blood
[1:07:24] which is for the remission of your sins
[1:07:27] that's its primary efficacy that's where
[1:07:30] it's directed to is to save the soul
[1:07:33] remission is translated to forgiveness
[1:07:35] deliverance or liberty and the scripture
[1:07:38] means to release from bondage or
[1:07:40] imprisonment
[1:07:41] it's the remission the releasing of the
[1:07:43] bondage of your soul the liberty of your
[1:07:45] soul the forgiveness of your soul it
[1:07:47] comes from a family meaning to leave
[1:07:49] behind your soul is not being left
[1:07:51] behind but sins are being left behind it
[1:07:53] comes from to abandon or to expire the
[1:07:56] very root of this word is its conjugate
[1:07:58] means to destroy the union or to
[1:07:59] separate from when i have re the
[1:08:02] remission of sins means i've taken your
[1:08:04] soul which was joined with sin and
[1:08:06] though it may have seemed to be so mixed
[1:08:09] together to where it was black i've been
[1:08:11] able to take sin out of it completely
[1:08:13] separate it leave it behind destroy the
[1:08:16] union that is what the remission of sin
[1:08:18] means it means you've been released from
[1:08:20] sin it no longer has power over you this
[1:08:24] is even part of the commission in luke
[1:08:26] 24 as the commission is given
[1:08:28] in the reading in luke verse 47 and that
[1:08:30] repentance and remission of sin should
[1:08:32] be preached in his name among all
[1:08:34] nations beginning at jerusalem
[1:08:36] so when they were to go in all the world
[1:08:38] and preach the gospel and to him that
[1:08:39] believeth in and as baptized shall be
[1:08:41] saved what were they preaching remission
[1:08:43] of sins
[1:08:44] they weren't preaching the healing of
[1:08:46] the body they were preaching the
[1:08:47] remission of sins
[1:08:49] so peter on the day of pentecost in acts
[1:08:51] 2 38 one of the most outstanding
[1:08:53] scriptures we can recognize in the bible
[1:08:55] then peter said unto them repent and be
[1:08:57] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:08:59] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:09:02] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:09:03] holy ghost
[1:09:05] the repentance and the faith in christ
[1:09:07] is the process by which god will take
[1:09:10] the sickness of sin upon the soul and
[1:09:13] separate it from you and destroy the
[1:09:15] union and so preaching remission of sins
[1:09:18] is the gospel
[1:09:21] the seal of god is a seal that your sins
[1:09:23] have been
[1:09:24] separated or abolished from your soul
[1:09:27] acts chapter 10 verse 43 to him give all
[1:09:30] the prophets witness
[1:09:32] that through his name whosoever
[1:09:33] believeth in him shall receive remission
[1:09:36] of sins
[1:09:38] romans 3 25 whom god hath set forth to
[1:09:41] be a perpetuation through faith in his
[1:09:44] blood he is going to be that offering
[1:09:46] he's going to be that price he's going
[1:09:47] to be that remedy the perpetuation
[1:09:49] through faith in his blood he is the
[1:09:50] mercy seat he is the atonement to
[1:09:52] declare his righteousness for the
[1:09:55] remission of sins that are passed
[1:09:57] through the forbearance of god
[1:10:00] even for to remit sins that are past
[1:10:04] because it was the remission of sins as
[1:10:05] paul is identifying even for those who
[1:10:07] had sinned in the old testament before
[1:10:09] the blood was even shed that's how
[1:10:11] powerful the blood is it can even put in
[1:10:13] put
[1:10:14] the remission of sins for those in the
[1:10:16] past
[1:10:17] because it atones for all
[1:10:20] the phrase to me
[1:10:22] remission of sins
[1:10:24] is so complete and total
[1:10:27] that it leaves no room for sin to ever
[1:10:28] come back
[1:10:30] the remission of sins ought to shed
[1:10:31] light then on the health of our mind and
[1:10:33] body just even that phrase
[1:10:35] because we know that sickness is the
[1:10:37] result of sin
[1:10:38] it's an attribute of sin
[1:10:40] so in john chapter 5 verse 14 as we read
[1:10:42] it today and afterward jesus finds him
[1:10:44] in the temple and says unto the impotent
[1:10:46] man who is healed
[1:10:47] again this is all this is all on his own
[1:10:50] the guy wasn't oh son of david have
[1:10:52] mercy on me he says behold thou art made
[1:10:54] whole there's your wholeness sin no more
[1:10:58] lest the worst thing come unto thee
[1:11:00] right
[1:11:01] this is this is with respect to his
[1:11:03] physical healing
[1:11:05] so where what is what is sickness a
[1:11:06] result of unbelief for sin
[1:11:09] so in order for a person in that state
[1:11:11] to rely upon to be remain perfectly
[1:11:13] whole in that it's a matter of them
[1:11:15] disbelieving
[1:11:18] for them to get sick brother brahman
[1:11:19] says and this is i have another
[1:11:20] statement from another servant but this
[1:11:22] listen to this one quickly sickness and
[1:11:23] sin are so closely associated together
[1:11:26] that it's almost like soul and body
[1:11:29] sickness and sin are so closely
[1:11:30] associated together it's like soul and
[1:11:31] body it's inseparable man has to die his
[1:11:34] soul is full of sin and his body's full
[1:11:36] of sickness and death is pronounced on
[1:11:38] him he's got to go his soul is sick and
[1:11:40] his body is sick
[1:11:42] and he says it's so closely associated
[1:11:43] together you can't even separate him the
[1:11:45] sin-sick soul and the sick body
[1:11:47] so think about this we have a sick soul
[1:11:49] and a sick body and they're inseparable
[1:11:51] right
[1:11:52] so then god heals the soul what's
[1:11:54] happened there's been some dis
[1:11:56] disentangling
[1:11:59] right so now you have a well soul
[1:12:02] but a sick body that still has to die
[1:12:05] in the sermon can we see jesus this is a
[1:12:07] my last last really lengthy statement to
[1:12:10] you so so that's the way divine healing
[1:12:12] is i know it's getting late i know it's
[1:12:14] hot it's cooler now than when it started
[1:12:18] so that's the way divine healing is
[1:12:20] it's based not upon some emotion
[1:12:22] not upon shaking or something of that
[1:12:24] type not upon anything
[1:12:26] but accepting what god promised you and
[1:12:28] jesus died that you may have
[1:12:33] no one can properly and clearly preach
[1:12:35] the gospel without preaching divine
[1:12:36] healing you just can't do it
[1:12:39] let's think spiritually about this
[1:12:42] let's really get to the heart of this
[1:12:44] let's get down to the real
[1:12:46] root of the glory that's within our
[1:12:47] souls and notice what this looks like
[1:12:49] because the remission of sins the fact
[1:12:51] that our sins have been remitted and all
[1:12:52] these statements we read the shedding of
[1:12:54] his blood by stripes were healed for the
[1:12:55] remission of sins for the mission of
[1:12:56] sins let's look at this now as we're
[1:12:58] closing soon
[1:12:59] for sickness is an attribute of sin
[1:13:02] and you can't deal with sickness without
[1:13:04] dealing with sin
[1:13:06] because sickness came as a attribute of
[1:13:08] sin
[1:13:09] before we had any sickness
[1:13:11] we had no sin but when we got sin
[1:13:14] sickness followed
[1:13:16] you have to deal with both together
[1:13:20] now
[1:13:21] he's he's coming back primarily to the
[1:13:23] perpetuation
[1:13:26] that it wasn't that he was crucified on
[1:13:28] the cross solely for our divine healing
[1:13:31] or
[1:13:32] even for specifically our divine healing
[1:13:35] but it was to atone for sin
[1:13:38] and what he's saying is they're so
[1:13:39] closely linked together you can't
[1:13:41] separate them
[1:13:43] you can't you can't pay a debt with an
[1:13:46] ounce of flesh without exacting some
[1:13:48] blood
[1:13:51] i don't know why you just use that as an
[1:13:52] example but it's one of those cliches
[1:13:54] that makes you think
[1:13:56] may i like may i like say it like this
[1:13:58] if a big animal had his pawn i know we
[1:13:59] read this here recently i think if a big
[1:14:01] animal had his paw in my side and was
[1:14:02] tearing up my ribs the rest of the
[1:14:04] animal wasn't bothering me but it was
[1:14:05] just his paw and he was tearing my ribs
[1:14:07] out now i do not have to find a knife to
[1:14:09] cut off his paw just knock him in the
[1:14:12] head
[1:14:13] that kills the whole animal
[1:14:14] well that's the way with sin
[1:14:17] so the head
[1:14:19] of the the paw in your side the thorn in
[1:14:21] your flesh the thing that's causing you
[1:14:23] pain or sickness in your body
[1:14:25] is the head of that is sin
[1:14:28] and so he's saying well that's the way
[1:14:30] it is with sin when you kill sin
[1:14:32] you kill every attribute that follows it
[1:14:36] so it may not be that you've sinned but
[1:14:38] the weakness of your parents and your
[1:14:39] parents parents
[1:14:41] says sickness is hereditary in many
[1:14:44] cases
[1:14:44] and through each generation gets weaker
[1:14:46] and wiser as the scripture says and so
[1:14:48] therefore you have to deal with sickness
[1:14:52] and sin on the same basis of the
[1:14:54] atonement
[1:14:55] this is such beautifully deep enriched
[1:14:58] teaching these statements brother
[1:14:59] branham are making are just it's endless
[1:15:01] in its depth it's so vast in its
[1:15:03] application he's saying that christ's
[1:15:05] price on calvary and the shedding of his
[1:15:08] blood was the price that crushed the
[1:15:10] head of the serpent
[1:15:12] and it paid the price of sin that's the
[1:15:15] head of the beast that's the head of the
[1:15:16] animal but then the paul that then had
[1:15:19] itself in the body that caused sickness
[1:15:22] when he paid for sin he had to deal with
[1:15:25] the power of the beast to make your body
[1:15:28] sick
[1:15:29] so he's saying you have to deal with
[1:15:30] sickness and sin on the same basis of
[1:15:32] the atonement
[1:15:35] so if sin which is related to the soul
[1:15:37] and sickness which is related to the
[1:15:39] body and spirit are on the same basis
[1:15:42] then so is remission
[1:15:46] so think of
[1:15:47] think of the term remission
[1:15:49] not in the scriptural sense
[1:15:51] but in a healing sense or a physical
[1:15:53] sense a medical sense
[1:15:56] remission
[1:15:58] in a in a
[1:16:00] health care setting means the reduction
[1:16:02] or disappearance of signs or symptoms of
[1:16:04] a disease
[1:16:06] when someone says their their thyroid
[1:16:08] disease is in remission or cancer is in
[1:16:10] remission or this disease or this
[1:16:11] problem is in remission it means there's
[1:16:13] a disappearance of the signs and
[1:16:15] symptoms
[1:16:16] now this remission medically can be
[1:16:19] partial or complete
[1:16:21] and that's that's where science has to
[1:16:23] do in the realm of science so they have
[1:16:24] a complete remission when there's
[1:16:26] complete remission this is what it means
[1:16:27] test
[1:16:28] physical exams scans every test they run
[1:16:31] on your blood every scan they do of your
[1:16:32] body every physical test everything
[1:16:35] shows that all signs of the disease are
[1:16:38] gone in other words everything that was
[1:16:40] there before they begin to point them to
[1:16:42] the initial diagnosis and they say based
[1:16:43] on your blood test based on your scans
[1:16:45] we see a physical mass we see the scan
[1:16:48] your blood test shows that your body is
[1:16:49] fighting this it's all positive for this
[1:16:51] when someone is in complete remission it
[1:16:53] goes back to the way it was before where
[1:16:56] there is no mass there's nothing in your
[1:16:58] blood it's like look we don't even have
[1:17:00] any record at all that can tell that you
[1:17:02] have it when you're in complete
[1:17:03] remission it's that all signs evidence
[1:17:06] symptoms
[1:17:07] indication that cancer or disease is
[1:17:10] gone
[1:17:12] and they call it full remission
[1:17:14] it's the total disappearance of all
[1:17:15] signs and symptoms of a disease to where
[1:17:17] science can actually say and some
[1:17:19] doctors say you're cured or they use the
[1:17:21] phrase no evidence
[1:17:24] that's what remission means to someone
[1:17:26] who's physically sick
[1:17:28] and so in hebrews chapter 10 verses 14
[1:17:30] to 18 for by one offering he hath
[1:17:32] perfected forever them that are
[1:17:34] sanctified
[1:17:35] whereof the holy ghost also is a witness
[1:17:37] to us
[1:17:39] for after that he had said before
[1:17:42] this is the covenant that i will make
[1:17:44] with them after those days saith the
[1:17:45] lord
[1:17:46] i will put my laws into their hearts
[1:17:50] and their minds will i write them
[1:17:52] and their sins and iniquities will i
[1:17:55] remember no more
[1:17:58] their sins and iniquities when there is
[1:18:01] the remission of sins there is no
[1:18:03] evidence where there is the remission of
[1:18:05] sins there are no signs there are no
[1:18:08] skins there are no tests there are no
[1:18:10] symptoms as far as god is concerned a
[1:18:13] person is in full and complete remission
[1:18:16] wherever he has written the word in
[1:18:18] their hearts and listen how the language
[1:18:20] just tracks the science their sins and
[1:18:23] iniquities will i remember no more they
[1:18:25] are cured
[1:18:26] now where remission of these is there is
[1:18:29] no more offering of sins
[1:18:32] when a person is in complete or full
[1:18:34] remission they cease treatment
[1:18:38] there's no need to treat it anymore
[1:18:40] there's no need for those pills there's
[1:18:41] no need for this there's no need for
[1:18:43] that you are as far as we are concerned
[1:18:46] you are in full and complete remission
[1:18:51] so he says where sins have been remitted
[1:18:53] where i there is no evidence where
[1:18:55] there's no signs when there's not even
[1:18:57] signs that it was there before it's as
[1:18:59] if you have been made whole
[1:19:03] to a person who has never had sin who's
[1:19:05] never had a heart attack who's never had
[1:19:06] this never had that
[1:19:08] that's why science sometimes when god
[1:19:10] heals somebody they're like well we've
[1:19:11] been kind of trying to dig around to put
[1:19:13] a name on what you had
[1:19:15] but we can't even find what we thought
[1:19:17] we saw before
[1:19:19] so
[1:19:21] we're just going to believe it was this
[1:19:22] or believe it was that or say it's this
[1:19:24] or say or just keep on looking and keep
[1:19:26] on looking and it didn't amazing that
[1:19:27] they might be bird dogging something
[1:19:29] gosh god decided just to make whole
[1:19:34] i can't even find antibodies for this we
[1:19:36] can't even find elevated that we can't
[1:19:38] even find this we can't even find that
[1:19:39] why he is remitted now listen if that's
[1:19:42] the way it is for the soul
[1:19:44] and they're so linked together
[1:19:46] that he even uses this language and the
[1:19:48] scripture that we are
[1:19:51] our soul has been per he has perfected
[1:19:53] forever them that are sanctified the
[1:19:55] holy ghost is a witness of this covenant
[1:19:57] that the word is written into our souls
[1:19:59] and he's going to write in our hearts
[1:20:00] and in our minds and our sins and
[1:20:02] iniquities are remembered no more it
[1:20:04] says it's remission are the sins their
[1:20:07] soul is in remission
[1:20:09] and therefore since they are in
[1:20:10] remission there does not need to be a
[1:20:12] repetitive offering for sin because the
[1:20:14] soul has been made whole it needs
[1:20:17] there's no perpetual it doesn't need it
[1:20:18] anymore it's done it's in remission
[1:20:21] and it's upon this basis i'm closing
[1:20:23] it's upon this basis that we approach
[1:20:25] the healing of our minds it's upon this
[1:20:28] basis that we want to approach the
[1:20:29] healing of our bodies we are in
[1:20:31] remission already
[1:20:35] we have already experienced the greatest
[1:20:37] miracle of all no matter what the scan
[1:20:39] show what the blood test show what the
[1:20:41] symptoms show no matter what my mind or
[1:20:43] body is signaling i can stand here as a
[1:20:45] survivor of sin i could stand here as
[1:20:48] somebody who at one time had every bit
[1:20:51] of evidence of death in darkness and
[1:20:53] disease but my soul is in remission and
[1:20:56] i could stand as a survivor of sin and
[1:20:59] say i'm more than a survivor i'm more
[1:21:02] than a conqueror i am an overcomer
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:06] because the greatest miracle of all
[1:21:10] has taken place on my soul
[1:21:13] and that's what the promise of wholeness
[1:21:14] does it ought to connect us to the god
[1:21:17] that's in us
[1:21:18] to stir up that healing that's within
[1:21:22] because let's
[1:21:24] close i want to read this statement
[1:21:25] let's just take it to the last slide in
[1:21:27] the rising of the sun
[1:21:30] divine healing is for our soul
[1:21:32] as far as spirit for our bodies
[1:21:36] the promise of wholeness harmony among
[1:21:38] the parts
[1:21:41] and whenever my spirit's not right
[1:21:44] and my body's not right
[1:21:46] i need to remember what it what it feels
[1:21:48] like to be right
[1:21:50] and what it means to feel it in the soul
[1:21:54] it's an attitude adjustment
[1:21:56] that's really what it is when you think
[1:21:57] about it
[1:21:59] it's an attitude adjustment
[1:22:01] we get so worried about these other
[1:22:03] things
[1:22:04] and it's easy to do especially if you
[1:22:05] rest on your mind your spirits
[1:22:07] but faith has got to start to heart the
[1:22:09] heartbeat has to come back again
[1:22:12] i'm in remission
[1:22:14] if sin
[1:22:16] is gone
[1:22:17] talk about a powerful place right
[1:22:19] if sin is gone
[1:22:21] and sin has been disentangled
[1:22:24] from my soul
[1:22:26] then let that become the force by which
[1:22:28] it can drive sickness
[1:22:30] because the healing is in you
[1:22:33] this is the promise of wholeness
[1:22:36] maybe your faith can reach out and grab
[1:22:37] this last statement
[1:22:39] dear god
[1:22:41] as he's praying we do this in the name
[1:22:42] of jesus christ
[1:22:44] the only name given among men whereby
[1:22:46] that we could be saved or healed
[1:22:49] these people
[1:22:51] who are fellow citizens of the kingdom
[1:22:54] a possessor
[1:22:55] of quickening power
[1:22:57] quicken it to them who is he praying to
[1:23:01] people who possess quickening power
[1:23:04] fellow citizens of the kingdom quicken
[1:23:06] it to them there's a quickening and
[1:23:08] there's more quickenings
[1:23:10] this is the language and may the spirit
[1:23:12] go from eagle to eagle
[1:23:15] word to word
[1:23:17] till the fullness of jesus christ be
[1:23:19] made manifest in each of the bodies for
[1:23:21] physical spiritual or any need they have
[1:23:24] need of
[1:23:25] there's your promise
[1:23:27] from eagle to eagle word to word you are
[1:23:30] a possessor of quickening power that's
[1:23:32] my attitude adjustment no matter how
[1:23:34] sick i get how depressed i get i am the
[1:23:36] possessor of quickening power so i am
[1:23:39] praying that the spirit will visit this
[1:23:40] eagle that eagle this word that word
[1:23:42] until christ is made manifest physically
[1:23:46] spiritually or whatever i have need of
[1:23:48] because that's the promise i'm living in
[1:23:49] now
[1:23:52] is the promise of wholeness
[1:23:55] god bless you let's stand together
[1:23:57] musicians who come
