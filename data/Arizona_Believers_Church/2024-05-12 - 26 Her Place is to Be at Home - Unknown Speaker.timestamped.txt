[0:00] before we continue in the subject of the
[0:03] house of the Lord and before we give you
[0:04] our title for today I'd like just to
[0:06] call back to uh title the last two
[0:09] services on a mortgaged home and I just
[0:13] wanted to take a moment to ask where are
[0:15] all my
[0:17] friends because only one person reached
[0:20] out to me and said hey did you spell
[0:22] mortgage wrong and uh and I wrote back
[0:25] and I said hey you know what you're the
[0:26] one true friend I have in the whole
[0:27] church he said not it wasn't even me
[0:29] that saw it was my wife and she had
[0:32] asked and so I thought I had one friend
[0:34] and it's just uh you know someone who
[0:37] was really concerned about my spelling
[0:38] skills so I'm sure if we dug deep we
[0:41] could find a type for a mort aged home
[0:43] uh or a mort aged home and U Mort I
[0:46] think comes from Moors which speaks of
[0:48] death or Blackness so maybe it's a black
[0:50] age home I don't know I don't know and
[0:53] I'm not trying to be super spiritual but
[0:55] people are like that so maybe someone
[0:57] somehow will find a really really deep
[1:00] deep meaning in my inability to spell on
[1:02] this title slide you'll be comforted to
[1:04] know that in my notes and even online
[1:06] it's spelled correctly I think but I'm
[1:09] just wondering where are all my friends
[1:10] at when I could not only just do it one
[1:13] time but twice and this brother said
[1:15] just in case you have a part three I
[1:18] wanted you to know that you don't know
[1:19] how to spell and they're not here today
[1:21] so maybe I ran them off no they're
[1:23] actually with with family so today my
[1:26] title is her place is to be at home
[1:30] and for whatever reason my beautiful
[1:32] font that I had I need to check this I
[1:34] don't think my fonts are coming through
[1:36] correctly and that's a real shame um I
[1:40] can't get anything right on the title
[1:41] slides we might just need to scratch
[1:42] this but her place is to be at home
[1:45] obviously this being a Mother's Day
[1:46] message you can already read into this
[1:48] but I'm going to ask you to not jump to
[1:50] any conclusions uh the title is done
[1:52] this way maybe as clickbait maybe for
[1:54] people to think in terms of wow that's
[1:57] pretty direct I did preach a couple few
[1:59] sermon one time called putting a woman
[2:01] in her place and uh for a lot of people
[2:03] they might have started going yeah but
[2:05] it wasn't exactly what they were
[2:07] expecting so I would say the same thing
[2:08] today uh don't jump to
[2:11] conclusions uh there is a target
[2:14] audience in this and it's not just
[2:16] mothers now if you'll just turn to Titus
[2:18] Chapter 2 veres 3 to
[2:22] 5 we'll we'll jump here in verse three
[2:25] and start into this subject the aged
[2:28] women likewise
[2:30] that they be in Behavior as becometh
[2:32] Holiness not false accusers not given
[2:34] too much wine teachers of good things so
[2:37] these are characteristics that and it's
[2:39] it's the highlights of certain
[2:41] characteristics that ought to be in a
[2:43] Christian woman and in this way it says
[2:45] aged women and so whether or not you
[2:47] want to affix a particular uh age to
[2:50] that or get a particular image but it's
[2:53] saying that women of a certain age women
[2:54] that are married women that are older
[2:57] have lived had some experience that they
[2:59] should be behave in a manner which is
[3:02] holy it shouldn't be false accusers not
[3:05] given to much wine and teachers of good
[3:08] things these are characteristics of a
[3:10] Godly woman and then it says that they
[3:12] may teach the young women so this is the
[3:14] reason why your lives are an example and
[3:17] you want to be living something and
[3:18] experiencing something not just telling
[3:20] somebody to do something that you
[3:22] yourself cannot do but it says to teach
[3:24] the young women to be sober to love
[3:26] their husbands to love their children
[3:28] now these would be things that the aged
[3:30] women themselves have already done or
[3:32] know or haven't experienced but they're
[3:35] to teach the young women to be sober to
[3:37] love their husbands to love their
[3:39] children there's some assumption that
[3:41] these young women are to be married and
[3:44] that the desire of God is that they
[3:45] would have children to be discreet
[3:47] chased keepers at home good obedient to
[3:51] their own husbands that the word of God
[3:53] be not blasphemed if you just recognize
[3:56] that last phrase there's all these
[3:58] things that are being elicited and
[3:59] encouraged in the aged women and the
[4:01] young women and at the end of the day
[4:03] these are things that would be overt or
[4:04] that could be seen things that are
[4:06] manifested in uh in character and in
[4:08] conduct and it says that these things do
[4:12] these things so that we don't blaspheme
[4:15] the word of God is not
[4:16] blasphemed and I want to just I want to
[4:19] focus on one phrase we could amplify a
[4:21] lot of these other terms and we we may
[4:23] find some other places just to highlight
[4:25] some of these things but it says that
[4:26] they are to be keepers at home in one
[4:30] place it is uh you know the word is
[4:33] Guardians of the house and so I think
[4:36] one of the alternative names for the
[4:38] Cleveland Indians was the the Cleveland
[4:40] housekeepers but it's keepers at home is
[4:43] Guardians of the house it literally
[4:44] means workers at home and this is a very
[4:47] specific phrase that Paul is saying that
[4:50] the aged women ought to teach the young
[4:52] women to be workers at home and one
[4:55] thing I want to be able to highlight in
[4:57] this first portion of this sermon is
[5:00] that God the scripture shows that God
[5:02] has appointed a duty uh at home that
[5:06] should fulfill a wife and a mother's uh
[5:09] heart and mind that there's things that
[5:11] the aged women have done and they found
[5:13] fulfillment in it and then these aged
[5:15] women or teach the young women that
[5:17] these are things that you ought to do
[5:19] and to be and it's not just in terms of
[5:21] the rules of religion but it's something
[5:23] that God has appointed and made a woman
[5:26] to be that will fulfill a wife's mind
[5:28] and heart
[5:30] John Wesley in commenting on this
[5:32] particular phrase keepers at home he
[5:34] says keepers at home whenever they are
[5:37] not called out by works of necessity
[5:39] piety and mercy and Wesley zeros in on
[5:43] the reality that there is a general
[5:46] commission to women a general calling
[5:48] that they're to be keepers at home but
[5:50] then there's times when necessity may
[5:52] call them out there's times when
[5:54] righteousness may call them out there's
[5:56] times when when mercy may call them out
[5:59] and so so you can't create this rule
[6:01] that says that a woman at no time can
[6:03] work uh if there if there's a needs that
[6:05] need to be met if there's certain if
[6:07] there's sickness if there's debt there
[6:08] may be ways uh things that intervene of
[6:11] necessity piety and mercy to where they
[6:14] have to work but that doesn't change
[6:16] their place there may be many different
[6:19] reasons why a a wife and a mother at
[6:21] that may be called into the workforce or
[6:23] to labor outside the home or to do
[6:26] things outside the home not necessarily
[6:28] working to earn an income but their
[6:30] place is at
[6:32] home and if a man can't work and the and
[6:35] the wife can then those are situations
[6:37] where uh the wife many times wants to
[6:40] and needs to but we know that if it was
[6:43] just to kind of Chase some ambition or
[6:45] just to have some of her own spending
[6:47] money and things like that in other
[6:48] words if her motive and objective is for
[6:51] herself and it's selfish then that puts
[6:53] her in Dangerous Ground uh that maybe
[6:55] she shouldn't be doing because again uh
[6:58] her place from in the scripture she's to
[7:00] be a keeper at
[7:02] home this biblical calling is built upon
[7:06] the foundational principles of bringing
[7:09] forth the woman in Genesis 2: 18 these
[7:12] are the founding principles for the
[7:14] bringing forth of the woman and the Lord
[7:16] said it is not good that the man should
[7:18] be alone I will make him a help meat for
[7:20] him in this act it completes the man
[7:23] it's quite extraordinary too because she
[7:25] was in him but then in the process of
[7:27] manifesting her it completes her him it
[7:30] is the completion of the man and doing
[7:32] this it's a help meet it's a co-laborer
[7:34] it's someone that fits his purpose and
[7:37] together and helps him fulfill his
[7:39] purpose so man is no longer just viewed
[7:41] as an entity that's fine on his own it's
[7:44] not good that man should be alone he
[7:46] needs to have a help meet so man is not
[7:49] complete until he's married and then
[7:51] after that he's finished and so there's
[7:54] this completion that takes place with
[7:56] the woman being by his side in a in a in
[7:59] a positive way in a fulfilling way so as
[8:02] strong as men may think they are as
[8:03] smart as men may think they are he has
[8:06] the need within himself for a wife he
[8:09] absolutely needs it for things where he
[8:11] is weak and for areas where he needs
[8:13] support and that is what the woman is to
[8:15] represent something that completes the
[8:17] man that is fit for his purpose and not
[8:20] that she alone would meet his needs but
[8:22] that he also would meet her
[8:25] needs but specifically as the scriptures
[8:28] uh bring for a woman and the context of
[8:31] it in Genesis chapter 2 and as Paul is
[8:33] touching on here as he writes to Titus
[8:35] God's purpose for the woman is related
[8:37] to the man and the bringing forth of
[8:39] children she is to be there for the
[8:42] purpose of helping the man fulfill that
[8:44] purpose but then it's also her purpose
[8:47] so Paul writes to Timothy in 1 Timothy
[8:49] chapter 3 excuse me 1 Timothy chap 5: 13
[8:53] to
[8:54] 14 and and he's speaking about even
[8:58] widowed women a a and the dangers of a
[9:01] woman without a husband and he says with
[9:03] all they learn to be idle wandering
[9:06] about from house to house and not only
[9:07] idle but tattlers also and Busy Bodies
[9:11] speaking things which they ought not
[9:14] these are things that become a
[9:16] Temptation or that is easy to slip into
[9:19] when a woman is not in her calling or
[9:21] her place and she's not busy with the
[9:23] things that God has made her to be
[9:25] she'll find herself tempted to do these
[9:27] things either be Idol or to be a busy
[9:30] body a tattletail uh uh um spreading
[9:33] rumors and those things things that they
[9:34] ought not to do and again it fits with
[9:36] what an aged woman should be doing she
[9:39] shouldn't be going from house to house
[9:40] spreading lies or speaking about rumors
[9:42] or spilling the tea but rather she
[9:44] should be teaching the younger and she
[9:45] should be do behaving herself in the
[9:48] right way you can see kind of a kinship
[9:50] between Titus Chapter 2 and even these
[9:52] verses in Timothy and then he says I
[9:55] will therefore that the younger women
[9:57] marry bear children guide the house give
[10:01] none occasion to the adversary to speak
[10:03] reproachfully so again it's a real
[10:05] similar trajectory that Paul is saying
[10:08] about the women that a teach the women
[10:12] to marry and to have children this is
[10:16] what is kind this is what a woman is
[10:18] made for this is in her she's made this
[10:20] way and Les it kind of touches on some
[10:23] sensitivities for some it's this is
[10:26] biology this is the way God has made
[10:29] them there's things a woman can do and a
[10:30] woman is fit to do that a man cannot do
[10:34] and so she is to marry bear children
[10:37] guide the house and again this phrase
[10:39] give none occasion to the adversary to
[10:41] speak reproachfully remember it says
[10:43] that the word of God be not blasphemed
[10:45] it's in the same way so it says to guide
[10:48] the house it it means to rule the house
[10:51] and this is the woman's due place to
[10:54] rule the house means she has some
[10:56] Authority she has some uh uh she is
[10:58] gifted tasked with a certain uh um
[11:01] qualifications to do this to if she's to
[11:03] guide the house then God will equip her
[11:05] to guide the house it doesn't mean that
[11:08] she rules over the man or that she's a
[11:10] ruler and that she's a dictator but she
[11:13] has an active duty in the house it is
[11:16] the glory of the woman to continue at
[11:18] home and to not go abroad is one of the
[11:20] sayings of the Scripture it is more
[11:23] fulfilling to work at home than to go
[11:26] about from house to house more
[11:28] fulfilling to labor at home and to teach
[11:30] the young women that it is to be a busy
[11:32] body it is more fulfilling to be to
[11:34] guide the house and to be a keeper at
[11:36] home than it is to be
[11:38] Idol and again it speaks of the reproach
[11:42] because life and conduct are the true
[11:44] test of religion a person's life a
[11:47] person's conduct are the true test of
[11:50] Doctrine and so this as Paul is saying
[11:53] in Titus and even in Timothy and we
[11:55] could find other places where he
[11:56] expresses the same the gospel should not
[11:59] not make women bad wives or unfit
[12:02] mothers the message should not make
[12:05] women unfit wives or unfit mothers and
[12:07] by the same token it shouldn't make men
[12:09] unfit husbands and unfit fathers the
[12:12] word of God being blasphemed and the the
[12:14] adversary speaking reproachfully is all
[12:17] in the certain expectations or certain
[12:19] decency and integrity and Accord and
[12:22] love and treatment that one should have
[12:23] to another and if the gospel was making
[12:25] women obstinate and stubborn and if the
[12:27] gospel was making men absent then they'd
[12:30] be like why would we want the gospel why
[12:32] would a Jew or a Greek or anyone for
[12:34] that matter want to adopt a doctrine
[12:37] that made put anyone else down or shame
[12:39] somebody else or deprive them of their
[12:41] god-given
[12:42] rights but yet the Bible is showing the
[12:45] glory of the woman and her Duty God's
[12:48] appointed duty to the woman that should
[12:50] bring her
[12:51] fulfillment I'm trying to go through
[12:52] this very quickly as again this title is
[12:55] her place is to be at home but it is not
[12:58] to be
[13:01] uh it it it would I don't want you jump
[13:04] into conclusions in proverbs 7: 10 to2
[13:07] and behold there met him a woman with
[13:09] the attire of a
[13:12] harlot it tells us that dress signals
[13:15] something and that's why it's important
[13:16] the manner in which we all dress she was
[13:19] dressed in the attire of a harlot and
[13:20] subtle of heart she is loud and stubborn
[13:24] her feet abide not in her house now she
[13:27] is without now in the streets and Li in
[13:30] weight at every corner there's a lot to
[13:33] this context in terms of how a man is
[13:36] taken and enticed and and and even some
[13:38] of the analogies to wisdom and
[13:40] foolishness that are being expressed
[13:41] here but this woman he says is loud
[13:45] clamoring she Wars she rages she's
[13:47] animated by desire and passion and
[13:49] stubborn it means
[13:51] defiant and the word stubborn is used
[13:53] even in Hosea 4:16 it's used of Israel
[13:56] that Israel slide back as a backsliding
[13:58] heer it's Israel is stubborn as a
[14:01] stubborn heer in other words it speaks
[14:02] of something that's uh unruly a a and
[14:06] Untamed that will not bear the Yoke oh
[14:09] she's not doing what she should be doing
[14:11] she's not she's Idol in the things that
[14:13] she should be doing she's busy in other
[14:15] things that she should not be doing and
[14:17] it says her feet abideth not in her
[14:19] house she's the opposite of one that
[14:21] stays at home and manages it she's the
[14:22] opposite of one that guides the home
[14:24] she's the opposite of one that keeps it
[14:26] home in other words maybe she's always
[14:29] Restless she's in the streets looking
[14:31] for opportunity looking for enticement
[14:33] she's looking beyond the home for her
[14:35] meaning she's looking beyond the home
[14:37] for purpose she's looking beyond the
[14:39] house to stay busy to stay occupied and
[14:41] have some sense of purpose and
[14:44] meaning but God made the woman a
[14:48] particular
[14:50] way and her place is to be at
[14:56] home maybe if I was preaching this in
[14:58] the ' 80s we'd have a little bit more
[14:59] amens I don't
[15:02] know but and I and I'll acknowledge it
[15:04] this biblical truth is
[15:06] controversial that it is either in some
[15:09] people's eyes and maybe trying to be
[15:11] nice it's outdated and that these things
[15:12] don't work anymore and that's just kind
[15:14] of an old traditional theology that
[15:16] developed at one time but all I've done
[15:18] at this point is just read to you
[15:20] scriptures and and even if you tried to
[15:22] say context this that and the other it's
[15:24] pretty plain to me that Paul is at least
[15:26] targeting an audience that he believes
[15:28] the women should be taught to be keepers
[15:30] at home that there are some group of
[15:32] women somewhere that he believes should
[15:34] be taught to marry bear children and to
[15:36] guide the Home and these are there to be
[15:38] workers at home Guardians of the home
[15:39] rulers of the home this is something
[15:41] that Paul is saying is fit for the woman
[15:44] and so to some it may be outdated to
[15:46] others it just might be outright
[15:48] oppressive and so we acknowledge that to
[15:50] some Ah that's kind of that's old
[15:53] fashion it doesn't really fit anymore
[15:55] and we realize that to others they may
[15:56] say now this is this is op Rive this is
[15:59] abusive and this is
[16:02] tyrannical and this is very dangerous
[16:04] and very toxic but I'd like to point
[16:06] this out as we begin to hopefully move
[16:08] into more of our subject this biblical
[16:10] truth although we could say a woman is
[16:12] to be a keeper at home and that the
[16:13] women is to marry and bear children and
[16:16] there's a way that we could begin to
[16:17] isolate these phrases and come up with
[16:19] some really good you know things that a
[16:21] woman should do or be this biblical
[16:23] truth should not be separated from the
[16:25] context of larger
[16:26] truth in other words you can't distill
[16:29] these things down to this is what God
[16:31] made women to be and they must be this
[16:33] in separate from the entire context of
[16:35] the Gospel that somehow we're going to
[16:37] ask women to be this and do this without
[16:39] the grace of Jesus Christ that is
[16:40] offered through through salvation that
[16:42] is offered through the shed blood and
[16:44] and separate it from all the context of
[16:46] scripture to where it just becomes a
[16:48] means to subjugate women or a rule of a
[16:51] rule of life that we entice women or
[16:54] encourage women to live by so that they
[16:55] can feel like they have some purpose and
[16:57] meaning if you miss the cross if you
[16:59] miss salvation if you miss the
[17:00] indwelling of the Holy Spirit it is
[17:03] subjugation it is
[17:07] oppressive I will say it this way as
[17:09] kind of my my maybe my thesis statement
[17:12] or my
[17:13] transitioning her place is to be at home
[17:16] but she is not to be the Builder of
[17:19] it she's a keeper not a builder she's a
[17:22] guide not not a not a builder and a wife
[17:26] cannot find her place if we say well the
[17:29] wife's her place is at home the mother's
[17:31] place is at home the woman's place is at
[17:33] home she cannot find her place unless
[17:35] that place has been prepared and
[17:37] provided and she's welcomed into
[17:40] it you don't just tell a woman to find
[17:42] her place you prepare it you provide it
[17:45] and you welcome her to it 1 Timothy
[17:49] 5:8 it says but if any provide not for
[17:51] his own house shall find that before he
[17:53] begins to deal with the aged women and
[17:56] the younger he deals first with the man
[17:57] and he says if any provide not for his
[17:59] own house especially for those of his
[18:01] own house or for his own and especially
[18:04] for those of his own house he ha denied
[18:06] the faith and his worse than an Infidel
[18:09] right these are very strong words if he
[18:11] does not provide for himself or even
[18:14] those of his own house he's denied the
[18:16] faith and is worse than an Infidel it is
[18:20] the role of the man to provide the place
[18:22] for the women for the wife and for the
[18:24] daughters it is not the role of the
[18:26] woman to merely find that Genesis 2:22
[18:30] it says in the rib which the Lord God
[18:31] had taken from man made he a woman and
[18:34] brought her unto the man notice how that
[18:38] God when he brought her forth he brought
[18:40] the woman to the man and he brought her
[18:43] out to a place that had already been
[18:45] prepared
[18:47] beforehand he didn't uh he didn't create
[18:50] the garden and then tell the woman to go
[18:51] set it up he didn't have the woman come
[18:54] first to get everything ready so that
[18:56] when Adam came home or came into the
[18:58] garden it would all be ready the garden
[19:00] was a place that a man the man belonged
[19:02] it was a place that he had already been
[19:03] laboring in to make fit for the woman
[19:06] that when she would come forth she would
[19:07] feel that she belonged he brought her
[19:10] unto the man it was a place where the
[19:12] man was it was a place that the man had
[19:13] provided and if a man does not provide
[19:16] for his own house if it is not prepared
[19:19] if it is not established correctly he
[19:21] has denied the faith why because the
[19:23] word of God does not destroy a man's
[19:26] natural duties righten the word of God
[19:28] God will not diminish a man's natural
[19:31] duties it perfects them in other words
[19:34] if there's some natural Duty that a man
[19:35] has to a woman whether he's a Muslim or
[19:38] whether he's a Jew or whether he's an
[19:40] atheist it doesn't matter if there's
[19:42] something that is expected of a man
[19:44] who's in relationship to a woman or man
[19:46] to women in general the gospel does not
[19:48] change that or diminish it it perfects
[19:51] what's expected of a
[19:53] man I would say the same for the woman
[19:57] but again our target audience today is
[19:59] not even the mom's in John 14: 2 to3 it
[20:03] says in My Father's House Jesus speaking
[20:05] says there are many mansions if it were
[20:07] not so I would have told you I go to
[20:10] prepare a place for you and if I go and
[20:14] prepare a place for you I will come
[20:17] again and receive you unto myself that
[20:20] where I am there you may be
[20:23] also I would say that these words are a
[20:26] model for man and his home that Christ
[20:29] says I'm going to prepare a place for
[20:31] you and once that place is prepared I
[20:34] will come again and receive you and we
[20:36] see the image of maybe a man who
[20:38] promises to marry and then he comes back
[20:40] at a particular time to marry his wife
[20:42] and we've seen so so it's a place that
[20:45] he's prepared where she's welcome it's a
[20:46] place where the bride is going to be
[20:49] invited into that has been prepared
[20:50] beforehand so this this speaks to us as
[20:53] men is Christ being the bridegroom that
[20:56] this place must be made made and it must
[20:59] be kept for
[21:02] her if I could say this we're the
[21:04] keepers of the home
[21:06] first and if men are not active in
[21:09] providing the place it forces
[21:13] Independence instead of instead of us
[21:15] just always uh looking at it from the
[21:17] standpoint of wellow the man was perfect
[21:19] it's got to be the woman's fault let's
[21:21] think of it this way if the man is not
[21:23] providing the place the protection the
[21:25] provision uh uh the position it for
[21:28] forces Independence I'm not suggesting
[21:31] in every situation a woman who's
[21:33] rebellious or stubborn or fails or does
[21:35] something wrong that the man has not
[21:37] done his part absolutely I'm certainly
[21:39] not expressing that but I am expressing
[21:42] the principle that when man is in
[21:43] relationship to a woman the man does not
[21:45] do his part in providing the place and
[21:48] keeping the place it
[21:50] forces
[21:52] Independence God brought the woman to a
[21:55] man not a
[21:56] child he brought the woman to a man not
[21:58] a monster he brought the woman to a man
[22:00] not a boy he brought the woman to a man
[22:02] not a
[22:03] brute and the man upon seeing the woman
[22:06] in verse 23 of Genesis 2 said this is
[22:09] now bone of my bones and Flesh of My
[22:11] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[22:14] she was taken out of
[22:16] man what we could gather from this is
[22:19] that Adam had an understanding of
[22:22] her that he had the right view of her
[22:26] that there was maybe some empathy there
[22:28] was some connection there was some
[22:29] knowledge that he had of her where he
[22:31] said I I can understand you I can be
[22:33] sympathetic I can be empathetic I I am
[22:36] identified with you and then she's
[22:37] forever linked to the Man by be calling
[22:39] woman because she came from man and so
[22:42] now when Adam looks at her and says bone
[22:44] of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh he's
[22:46] re assuming responsibility over
[22:50] her perhaps in a greater way than he did
[22:52] before when she would have been in him
[22:55] hidden and maybe unknown completely but
[22:58] now he's making an unselfish commitment
[23:00] and forever linking himself to
[23:03] her brother bam in the sermon a man
[23:05] running from the presence of the Lord
[23:06] said if I was a young man looking for a
[23:08] wife to be married and here stood a girl
[23:09] that met every qualification that I
[23:11] thought would took make a woman why
[23:13] morally she was a queen lovely fine
[23:15] personality real Christian everything
[23:17] that I could think of to make me a good
[23:19] wife no matter how much I say she's
[23:21] perfect she's exactly right she isn't
[23:23] mine till I accept her and the
[23:26] responsibility of her being my wife
[23:29] wife so when a man takes a woman he
[23:32] accepts her this is now bone of my bones
[23:34] Flesh of My Flesh he should work to
[23:37] understand her he should desire to know
[23:40] her and to have be sympathetic and to
[23:43] relate to her as Adam did when a man
[23:45] takes full responsibility is what
[23:47] brother man said he's got to take
[23:49] responsibility not just accept her but
[23:51] take the responsibility of her being his
[23:55] wife and when a man doesn't take full
[23:58] respons responsibility it robs the woman
[24:00] of her sense of
[24:01] belonging I think deeply about that in
[24:04] the sense that if a woman marries a man
[24:06] and she be she takes on his name she
[24:07] leaves her family she goes to live with
[24:09] the man but if he doesn't take full
[24:11] responsibility in failing to take full
[24:14] responsibility even if it's not even
[24:16] acknowledged or noted it will give her
[24:19] some sense of not fitting in when he
[24:22] doesn't accept her and take full
[24:24] responsibility whether she could put her
[24:26] finger on it or not she's not going to
[24:28] feel like she
[24:30] fits and it'll Rob her of the the her
[24:33] need to feel as if she belongs and has a
[24:37] place in Ephesians chap 5: 28 and 29 it
[24:40] says so ought men to love their wives as
[24:42] their own
[24:43] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[24:45] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[24:48] own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth
[24:49] it even as the Lord the
[24:53] church these words are very
[24:57] deep the selfish husband who lives only
[24:59] unto himself creates a toxic house that
[25:02] robs his wife of a
[25:04] home I think it's very clear when I say
[25:08] don't jump to
[25:09] conclusions there's a target audience
[25:12] and all the brothers are like well I
[25:13] can't wait till Father's Day
[25:18] then and the wies are like honey we're
[25:20] going to be out of town that
[25:22] weekend I have an appointment to go get
[25:24] my haircut on a Sunday and rearrange my
[25:27] sock drawer that afternoon
[25:31] that's think of this this description
[25:33] identifies someone who is not willing to
[25:35] make a selfless commitment though
[25:37] they're married in an arrangement a
[25:40] relationship when he lives to himself he
[25:43] creates an atmosphere that robs the
[25:45] woman of a home even if he's given her a
[25:48] house because he should nourish which
[25:50] means to bring up to maturity to nurture
[25:52] so there's even something about her love
[25:54] and her gifts and her ability that a man
[25:55] is to cultivate and to nurture
[25:58] to cherish it means to warm or to keep
[26:00] warm but it means to Foster with tender
[26:02] care some merely read this as a mandate
[26:06] to clothe and to feed but it means much
[26:08] more to that it means to make her feel a
[26:10] part of you to nurture her and to
[26:14] cherish her to where she feels that she
[26:16] is improving and growing and that this
[26:18] has been a benefit to her that it's been
[26:21] better for her that she's fostered with
[26:23] tender care and it's not that you just
[26:25] pity her and all this poor little thing
[26:27] I've got to take care of her the rest to
[26:28] my life but there's some connection and
[26:30] Affinity there and a responsibility that
[26:33] a man has taken that I must nourish a
[26:35] and nurture her and her gifts and
[26:37] provide her the tools and resources
[26:39] necessary for her to come into her
[26:41] Perfection for her to be the woman that
[26:42] she's called to be and I must cherish
[26:44] her to love her to adore her and to
[26:46] Foster her with tender care it makes her
[26:49] feel a part of you as brother Bram says
[26:52] you're supposed to be the boss of the
[26:54] house he says this to the man you're the
[26:55] ruler the Bible said the man shall rule
[26:58] he says not a dictator not a floor
[27:01] matat he made you a help meet a
[27:05] sweetheart to be Christlike is to not be
[27:07] harsh to be Christlike is to not be
[27:09] intolerant but to be giving to be
[27:11] sacrificial to be preserving to be
[27:13] washing these are the very things that
[27:14] it says a man ought to do to his wife he
[27:17] is Christlike not harsh he's Christlike
[27:19] not intolerant he's Christlike being
[27:21] forgiving being giving sacrificing
[27:24] washing as the scripture
[27:26] says in hoseah chapter 2 verses 19 and
[27:29] 20 what a statement that the Lord is
[27:31] making to Israel I will betro thee unto
[27:33] me
[27:35] forever I'll marry Thee I will betroll
[27:38] thee unto me in righteousness and in
[27:40] judgment and in loving kindness and in
[27:43] mercies I will even betro thee unto me
[27:46] in faithfulness Thou shalt know the
[27:49] Lord this is Christ this is God's
[27:52] marriage
[27:53] covenant it is in truth in honesty and
[27:56] in sincerity
[27:59] and and it has mature deliberation as he
[28:01] says I will betroll thee in
[28:03] righteousness in truth and in judgment
[28:05] this honesty and in loving kindness the
[28:09] utmost affection Tender
[28:12] Love and then it says and in
[28:15] Mercies in other words not by Merit not
[28:19] because the wife earns it but it's the
[28:22] duty that I owe
[28:24] her it says I will love her I will marry
[28:27] her in loving kindness and in mercies it
[28:30] doesn't it specifically means that the
[28:32] righteousness the judgment and the
[28:33] loving kindness must always exist even
[28:36] at times when you feel that she doesn't
[28:37] deserve it even at times where it seems
[28:39] as if she hasn't earned it it is not by
[28:42] Merit It Is by Duty I will marry you
[28:44] forever in righteousness judgment and
[28:46] loving kindness and I will betroll thee
[28:48] unto me in faithfulness I will be
[28:52] faithful to these
[28:56] things these are things that we could
[28:57] say are the marriage covenant these
[29:00] principles of the scripture that we have
[29:02] read to this point we could put into
[29:04] category of the ideal uh proposition the
[29:08] real standard of the scripture but Paul
[29:10] touches on something that's quite
[29:12] remarkable in Romans chap 1: 26- 28 for
[29:16] this cause gave God gave them up to vile
[29:18] affections because they would not retain
[29:19] God in their knowledge and because they
[29:21] would not look to him because they did
[29:22] not seek him God gave them up to vile
[29:25] affections reads this in a way that you
[29:28] maybe can expand a little bit just
[29:29] beyond maybe homosexuality and things
[29:32] but you gave them up to vile affections
[29:34] for even their women did change the
[29:36] natural use into that which is against
[29:38] nature so there is a nature of the woman
[29:41] that when we are given over to vile
[29:42] affections we change the natural use
[29:46] which is against their nature other the
[29:48] woman is no longer doing what she ought
[29:50] to do she's no longer feeling even what
[29:52] she's naturally called to do it says and
[29:55] likewise also the men leaving the
[29:57] natural use use of the woman so there is
[29:59] some uh connection between the man
[30:02] leaving the woman's natural use and the
[30:04] woman no longer in the woman changing
[30:06] her natural use it says burned in their
[30:09] lust one toward another men with men
[30:11] working that which is unseemly and
[30:13] receiving in themselves that recompense
[30:15] of their error which was meat and even
[30:18] as they did not like to retain God in
[30:19] their knowledge God gave them over to a
[30:21] reprobate mind to do th things which are
[30:24] not
[30:25] convenient I want you to at least Focus
[30:28] on vile affections against Natural use
[30:31] things which are unseemly and this
[30:34] reprobate mind and things that are not
[30:36] convenient when they left God's
[30:40] word it led mankind to do things which
[30:43] degraded themselves and the other by
[30:46] leaving the word of God by losing sight
[30:48] of God it led them to vile affections to
[30:51] leave their natural use and if there's
[30:53] no uh respect for God in his word then
[30:57] the very found founds of mutual respect
[31:00] erode if if a woman will not respect God
[31:03] it erodes the foundations of
[31:05] self-respect and respect for man if a
[31:07] man will not regard God it erods the
[31:09] foundations of mutual respect to Mankind
[31:11] and to one another and so because God
[31:13] was not acknowledge it they lost the
[31:15] very foundation of the decency of
[31:18] humanity you're just left with that
[31:20] serpent nature you're just left with the
[31:22] dog eat dog world you're left with the
[31:24] cane idea of you got to get yours and
[31:26] you got to mind yourself you got to
[31:27] protect
[31:29] yourself maybe I can ask it this way
[31:31] what do misogyny and feminism have in
[31:33] common sounds like a joke I know it does
[31:35] but it's not no respect for
[31:39] women that's what misogyny and feminism
[31:42] have in common is the lack of respect
[31:44] for
[31:45] women and as Paul relates these things
[31:47] here these vile affections and women
[31:49] changing their natural use which is
[31:51] against their nature and a men leaving
[31:52] the natural use of the woman notice how
[31:54] his sins is now predicated upon this uh
[31:57] uh not expecting and this the natural
[31:59] use of a woman he gives himself over to
[32:02] vile affections a and God then allows
[32:06] them that their sin begat sin in their
[32:09] sin God allowed
[32:10] sin it's such a a powerful thing that
[32:13] God gave them up and because of their
[32:14] sin it begat more sin whereas
[32:16] righteousness begats righteousness
[32:17] transgression be begats
[32:20] transgression they say it this way the
[32:22] rise of feminism and
[32:24] chauvinism we're not independent of each
[32:27] other or in
[32:29] vacuum we touched on this before when I
[32:32] ministered on a Mother's Day a few years
[32:34] ago I you read quoted from this book and
[32:39] I I know I've made this statement before
[32:40] but feminism offers a solution to women
[32:43] who are feeling out of
[32:45] place now I know I like to think of it
[32:47] that uh we' the men have been perfect
[32:49] the patriarchy is
[32:51] blameless and that men have always done
[32:53] everything perfect but the devil again
[32:55] is talking to the woman and he's
[32:56] spreading lies and she's getting getting
[32:58] all these crazy ideas in her heads and
[32:59] she's all emotional and she lives in a
[33:00] run room house in her head and we have
[33:02] all these reasons why it happens it
[33:03] always happened at the right time of the
[33:04] month right and it's everything's going
[33:06] crazy and it's all the woman's fault and
[33:09] that's what gave rise to feminism but
[33:10] they weren't independent of each other
[33:13] this the rise of feminism it offers to a
[33:15] woman an opportunity to to be heard to
[33:18] be seen to feel a part of something it
[33:21] offers something to a woman that's
[33:22] feeling out of place and so in this book
[33:25] that's challenging the idea of a woman's
[33:26] purpose that the woman woman's purpose
[33:28] can only be fulfilled by being a wife
[33:29] and a mother or housewife and a mother
[33:32] they write this the problem lay buried
[33:34] unspoken for many years in the minds of
[33:37] American women and I think the way they
[33:40] the language they're using is so dead on
[33:42] it was a strange stirring and a sense of
[33:44] dissatisfaction a yearning that women
[33:47] suffered in the middle of the 20th
[33:48] century in the United States each
[33:51] Suburban wife struggled with it
[33:53] alone as she made the bed Sho for
[33:56] groceries matched slip cover material
[33:58] ate peanut butter sandwiches with her
[34:00] children chauffeured Cub Scouts and
[34:02] brownies laid beside her husband at
[34:04] night she was afraid to ask even of
[34:06] herself the silent question is this
[34:10] all it's a pretty good observation I
[34:12] think it's a little bit overs simplistic
[34:14] in some way to say that uh All American
[34:17] women were having the same thought as
[34:18] they laid in bed at night but clearly
[34:22] they're touching on something where the
[34:24] woman is married with Children and she's
[34:27] making bed she she's domesticated she's
[34:29] shopping for groceries she's eating
[34:31] lunch with her children she's driving
[34:32] them to uh uh you know extracurricular
[34:35] activities and she's with her husband at
[34:37] night but then she's like is this all is
[34:39] this all to life wake up take care of
[34:42] the kids you know do all these domestic
[34:44] things is this oh and and maybe it was a
[34:47] a valid question but the the question
[34:50] suggests that something's missing
[34:53] right and so this woman I I think if I
[34:56] remember correctly it was woman writing
[34:58] this otherwise it' just be really
[34:59] bizarre that this man got into the heads
[35:01] of the women into the in the 20th
[35:03] century but we can no longer ignore that
[35:06] voice with wi within women that says I
[35:09] want something more than my husband and
[35:11] my children and my
[35:13] home I that's striking I want something
[35:17] more than my husband and my children and
[35:20] my
[35:21] home and I say they were they were right
[35:25] they were absolutely right she was
[35:28] longing for something more because she
[35:30] wasn't receiving all that she was
[35:33] due she didn't just want the husband and
[35:35] the children in the house all those
[35:38] things optically are great all those
[35:40] things seem to meet the semantics of
[35:42] what a marriage ought to be but it
[35:44] doesn't fulfill what the woman
[35:47] needs otherwise in some ways we could
[35:49] say God's done all he has for us just by
[35:51] giving us a church and song service and
[35:54] preaching and then when we leave it's
[35:55] like we've had we've had some semblance
[35:57] of relationship with him but there is
[35:59] something here that a woman saying I've
[36:01] got the husband I've got the children
[36:03] I've got the house I've got a lot of
[36:04] stuff to do but my heart still feels
[36:06] empty my mind's not completely full and
[36:08] it is indeed because something was
[36:11] lacking and that's not all she
[36:15] needed and therefore for the woman in
[36:17] clearly where she wanted something more
[36:20] than just the physical husband and
[36:21] something more than just the lital
[36:22] children in something more than just a
[36:24] physical house she wanted and needed
[36:26] something more the alternative to
[36:28] Independence then for her is I could
[36:30] either go out on my own and find what
[36:32] I'm looking for and find some sense of
[36:33] belonging and satisfy this emptiness
[36:36] this struggle that I'm going by alone
[36:38] this emptiness I feel the alternative to
[36:41] going out and trying to satisfy that is
[36:43] submission to
[36:44] hardness bitterness and hate that makes
[36:48] the woman feel all alone with her
[36:50] husband her children in her own
[36:54] house if I could say it this way the
[36:56] less the man was Christ in the house the
[36:58] more the women begin to feel less at
[37:02] home it wasn't that men were Godly and
[37:05] upstanding and doing everything right no
[37:07] this is this is identifying that
[37:09] husbandry was broken fatherhood was
[37:12] broken and that as things begin to break
[37:14] down they begin to exploit this longing
[37:17] and this need within a woman's heart to
[37:19] be to do something to be satisfied in
[37:21] heart and mind and the men thinking well
[37:23] I bought her a house and I've done this
[37:24] and I've given her children I've done
[37:25] this and she's busy she's got all these
[37:27] things to do do thinking that somehow
[37:28] that deao gives the woman what she needs
[37:31] missed out on this
[37:33] element that she was made to feel as if
[37:35] she belonged and she was a part of
[37:37] something and that you were in it
[37:38] together as this statement the wife
[37:41] struggled with it alone to me was one of
[37:43] the key
[37:44] factors that in all her cub scout trips
[37:47] and all her peanut butter sandwiches and
[37:49] all her grocery shopping and everything
[37:51] she was doing she felt like she had no
[37:53] support and was doing it on her own
[37:59] I'll say this it's one thing for a woman
[38:01] to refuse to take her place it's one
[38:03] thing for a woman to refuse her place
[38:06] and to be independent to to Buck what
[38:08] the scripture says a woman ought to do
[38:11] but let me just say it's also another
[38:13] thing if the place isn't
[38:15] provided it's one thing for a woman to
[38:18] look at her position or place and reject
[38:20] it and say I don't want it it's another
[38:21] thing if that place isn't
[38:23] provided her place isn't just a house
[38:28] a house that may be unwelcoming and
[38:29] cruel
[38:32] demanding a house that is not peaceful
[38:34] and restful and quiet is no home
[38:38] especially for the
[38:41] woman and I know there's an idea
[38:44] sometimes and it's not necessarily a
[38:45] nasty one but it certainly is a stubborn
[38:47] when I say nasty it's it's not because
[38:49] uh even as some of the you cartoons to
[38:52] the year say it's not because we pay I
[38:54] pay you less because you're a woman I
[38:56] pay you less because I'm a man
[38:58] right it's kind of this idea that man
[38:59] has somehow
[39:01] premeditated uh you know treating the
[39:02] women differently and so it's not that
[39:05] it's it's rooted in some nastiness but
[39:06] there's this stubborn idea that all
[39:09] domestic Duty and responsibility is
[39:10] solely the woman's I'll work I'll earn a
[39:13] paycheck you your job is to take care of
[39:15] the kids discipline the kids your job is
[39:17] to do everything in the home and Men Who
[39:20] leave all domestic Duty and
[39:21] responsibility to the H to of a
[39:24] house turn that house into a job site
[39:27] for the
[39:29] wife when a wife or a mother feel all
[39:33] alone or feels like she's alone that
[39:35] place cannot be called a
[39:38] home if I can put it this way when man
[39:40] is called away from True
[39:42] manhood that's what puts a woman out of
[39:45] a
[39:46] home now I know there's a again I'm not
[39:49] I'm not dis uh discounting or
[39:52] disregarding an idea where a woman can
[39:54] be obstinate a woman could be out of her
[39:55] place she could be stubborn and she can
[39:57] be laugh and and these different things
[39:58] that we could highlight in the scripture
[40:00] where a woman is clearly out of her
[40:01] place and she's exhibiting a spirit of
[40:03] Le DEA or however else we'd like to
[40:05] characterize it but if a man is being
[40:08] called away from his place in manhood
[40:11] that will put the woman out of the
[40:14] house puts her out of a home and not
[40:17] being at home will cause her to do
[40:19] things it sometimes forces that
[40:21] Independence brother Bram in the sermon
[40:23] thirsting for Life says now if a man is
[40:25] if a man is sick and his wife can't work
[40:28] and or he can't work I mean I don't
[40:31] blame his wife's got to make a living
[40:33] that's right but if she goes out working
[40:36] to have a little extra money you better
[40:37] keep away from that scallywag Bunch that
[40:39] she's working with out there I think it
[40:41] just highlights that you better be
[40:43] certain in these situations where
[40:44] there's some departure from the general
[40:47] principle and God gives a Grace and it's
[40:49] not legalistic that that the your
[40:51] reasons for working have been well
[40:53] prayed through and thought out and it's
[40:55] not just opportunity and it's not just
[40:57] uh you know income alone but it's like
[41:00] if we do this it'll take care of this or
[41:02] we have this need uh maybe sometimes
[41:05] that medical needs arise in a family
[41:07] medical bills come up and the kids need
[41:09] braces and there's no way they're going
[41:10] to get braces unless there's extra
[41:12] income and these things are of necessity
[41:14] so there's times when necessity piety
[41:17] and mercy will call a woman uh outside
[41:19] the home to labor and to work and if if
[41:22] it's not the right thing brother Bam's
[41:24] identifying that's when there's trouble
[41:27] he says her place is home that's it here
[41:30] she's supposed to be at home that's
[41:34] it and he says and
[41:39] Mister you might call yourself ever so
[41:43] good but if you've got lodges and other
[41:45] things I I can't remember how recently
[41:47] we read this but you might feel like
[41:49] you're a pretty good message believer
[41:51] but if you have lodges clubs Recreation
[41:54] things that you belong to things that
[41:56] you're committed to and things that you
[41:57] enjoy and other things that call you
[41:59] away from her at night you ought to be
[42:01] ashamed of
[42:02] yourself there's this expectation that a
[42:05] man would leave the house to go to labor
[42:08] and I know that those things have
[42:09] changed and and as over the last 5 to 10
[42:12] years those things changed quite a bit
[42:14] where more working from home was done
[42:15] and then covid almost proved just how
[42:17] many workforces could be uh at home and
[42:20] there was now a transfer of overhead to
[42:23] the individuals who work at home and so
[42:25] now the corporations don't have to pay
[42:26] rent any more and they don't have to
[42:27] have Donuts in the break room and things
[42:29] like that so they're just they've got
[42:30] our nose to the grindstone don't
[42:33] they now he's say he's saying that
[42:36] there's obviously a man is called Away
[42:38] by duty to work and that would give some
[42:40] separation from family and if you feel
[42:43] like I'm just taking too much Liberty
[42:44] with this uh that may be your defense
[42:47] mechanism but plainly he's saying that a
[42:51] man is out working all day or maybe he's
[42:53] in his office at home all day and he's
[42:54] got things he needs to do as a man but
[42:56] then when his work commitments over he
[42:58] finds all these other things that keeps
[43:00] him away from his family he's saying wow
[43:04] something's wrong you should be ashamed
[43:06] right God gave you a home to cherish and
[43:10] comfort and things like that now I
[43:13] believe it means he gave you a home for
[43:14] you to cherish he gave you a home to
[43:17] comfort not a place to work and then you
[43:18] can leave and go do your fun things at
[43:20] night while you leave the woman on the
[43:22] job site the rest of the day that's he
[43:26] he's not just there's not this division
[43:27] of Duty where you're the wife and I'll
[43:29] work and I'll recreate and you'll just
[43:31] do all the things that has to be done at
[43:33] home dishes and laundry and everything
[43:35] else no you're a partner in
[43:37] it and I've waited until my kids are
[43:39] doing laundry and washes dishes to
[43:41] preach this waited till There's No More
[43:44] Diapers to change to preach this you
[43:45] know how old these notes
[43:52] are it's we're Partners in
[43:55] it he says it's gave you a home to
[43:58] cherish and comfort things like that I
[44:00] want to emphasize it this way a home for
[44:02] you as a man to cherish it for you as a
[44:04] man to comfort it and that home is to be
[44:07] what cherishes you and comforts you not
[44:10] the stuff out there the home and he says
[44:14] it's a shame to see the way a man do
[44:16] does their
[44:17] wife it's a shame to see the way man
[44:19] does their wives and wives do men the
[44:22] Womanhood and fatherhood of the nation
[44:24] is tore to Pieces divorce courts piled
[44:25] up Jesus said would be that way this
[44:27] ties into our Mortage home as it was in
[44:30] the days of Noah they were Maring and
[44:32] given in marriage until the day that
[44:33] Noah entered into the ark that that day
[44:36] when the son of man is revealed is
[44:38] characterized by the eating and drinking
[44:41] the buying and selling the planting and
[44:43] building brother B said it's a sin and a
[44:47] disgrace to enter into
[44:49] marriage to plant to harvest to build to
[44:53] sell to buy and to do all that and then
[44:57] the main things be
[44:58] missing the togetherness the belonging
[45:00] the the commitment to one another the
[45:02] mutual
[45:04] respect I'm putting the onus on the man
[45:08] today in 1 Peter chapter 3: 1 7 to
[45:12] 11
[45:13] 711 where are they
[45:16] anymore likewise ye husbands dwell with
[45:18] them according to knowledge giving honor
[45:20] unto the wife as under the weaker vessel
[45:24] and as being HS together of the grace of
[45:25] Life I'll read through this and then go
[45:27] back through some of these words that
[45:27] your prayers be not hindered hindered
[45:29] think of that this you ought to do
[45:32] otherwise you will suffer
[45:34] personally the way you treat your wife
[45:37] will indicate how clear your channel is
[45:39] with the Lord in
[45:40] prayer finally be ye all of One mind
[45:43] having compassion one of another he has
[45:45] not left the duty of a husband to the
[45:48] wife but yet we could all enter into
[45:50] Fellowship of having compassion one of
[45:52] the other love is Brethren be pitiful be
[45:53] courteous not rendering evil for evil or
[45:56] railing for railing contr eyes blessing

[46:11] happy if a man is talking in the
[46:13] wilderness and his wife can't hear him
[46:14] is he still wrong right those different
[46:16] questions that we all we all pose at
[46:19] times but this is the real secret for he
[46:22] that will love life and see good days
[46:25] this is the secret to the happiness let
[46:27] him refrain his tongue from evil and his
[46:29] lips that speak that they speak no guile
[46:32] let him asso evil that's not cashew it's
[46:35] isue evil and do good let him seek peace
[46:38] and ensue it this men is the recipe you
[46:42] must
[46:43] learn this is one thing you better be
[46:46] cooking amen this is the recipe for a
[46:49] woman to fill up to make a woman feel at
[46:52] home you may pick up on my play of words
[46:55] there in my title now this is how you
[46:57] can make a woman feel at
[46:59] home dwell with your wives according to
[47:02] knowledge give your wives no excuse for
[47:05] being
[47:06] unkind give your wives no excuse for
[47:08] being
[47:09] unfaithful that's right according to
[47:12] knowledge giving honor show respect and
[47:14] care you're a protector you're a
[47:15] supporter because of your strength you
[47:18] demonstrate this honor this respect and
[47:21] care be compassionate considered is what
[47:23] he's asking sympathetic feeling for her
[47:26] bear ing her
[47:27] burdens I know as men we often think
[47:30] well she doesn't know what it's like to
[47:31] work and she doesn't know what it's like
[47:32] to be faced with lust and she doesn't
[47:34] know what it's like to be she doesn't
[47:35] know what it's like and we always want
[47:37] them to be sympathetic you start first
[47:39] by putting yourselfself in her shoes and
[47:42] what she must feel with the things that
[47:45] you
[47:46] do because you're the stronger
[47:50] vessel be tender-hearted and friendly
[47:53] minded is what it's telling us of a
[47:55] humble mind cultivate the relationship
[47:57] ship you take the initiative to
[47:59] cultivate the
[48:00] relationship not rendering evil for evil
[48:03] in other words do nothing but
[48:05] good even when bad is done to
[48:08] you that if if the woman does evil to
[48:11] the man the man is not justified in
[48:12] returning it the man is under a mandate
[48:14] to not return evil when evil is done but
[48:17] always do
[48:19] good not railing for railing in other
[48:21] words returning in kind I think this one
[48:23] is so dead on I had some notes on this
[48:25] recently when we're ministering on the
[48:27] home life a a and being responsive and
[48:30] not just rebuttal and re giving back
[48:32] railing for railing in other words
[48:33] returning to kind giving back what
[48:34] you've been
[48:36] given I think it's our knee-jerk
[48:38] reaction it's our Instinct that if
[48:39] someone goes we just go right we just
[48:43] mirror it you got to break that that
[48:46] when it's escalated on one side we don't
[48:48] escalate it on the other but we find
[48:50] ways to disengage the escalation and
[48:52] deescalate and solve it says refrain thy
[48:54] tongue from evil men refrain your tongue
[48:58] from lying and dishonesty deceit and
[49:00] being doubled tongue and says and not
[49:03] speaking guile withhold the words that
[49:05] tear
[49:06] down that hurt and
[49:09] destroy asso evil and do good and seek
[49:12] peace avoid evil do good and seek peace
[49:15] even if it seems hard to do pursue good
[49:18] do
[49:19] right and join yourself to peace at
[49:22] whatever whatever means is
[49:24] necessary this is a recipe for a
[49:35] home this is a recipe for a really good
[49:38] happy Mother's Day
[49:43] sermon and some brothers are like I
[49:45] didn't know it was Mother's Day I'm in
[49:47] big trouble I'm in big trouble over
[49:49] there on open table trying to find
[49:53] reservations they're booked there's no
[49:55] more seats
[49:58] brother bam says and God has provided a
[50:00] way I I doing really good on time here
[50:02] so I think we'll we'll end at a decent
[50:04] time we won't preach long enough to
[50:05] empty out the restaurants I
[50:07] apologize but because this is very
[50:09] direct and I feel that I could speak
[50:11] manto man to the men here today and I
[50:13] don't think they'll resent me in it I do
[50:15] think that a man always runs the risk uh
[50:18] of hurting a woman when he preach on
[50:21] preaches on things that are expected of
[50:23] a woman because again he's up there as a
[50:26] man who doesn't he doesn't have the
[50:27] heart of a woman there's situations he
[50:29] doesn't know so a man always have has to
[50:31] be careful a minister and men have have
[50:34] to be very very careful when they wield
[50:35] the word that they don't turn it into a
[50:37] stick a codo that they beat women with
[50:40] and it's real easy to do even if you
[50:42] don't mean it uh just even you know just
[50:45] try to comb a girl's hair right it's a
[50:47] brush you're just trying to get the
[50:48] knots out well if you don't use it
[50:50] correctly there can be a lot of owls and
[50:52] stop and that hurts you're like I'm just
[50:54] trying to comb your hair and and so if
[50:57] that's what you're trying to do you got
[50:58] to be very very careful and so I'm being
[51:01] more direct to the men because I believe
[51:02] that's a safe place to be and I do think
[51:04] that it's within our power as men to
[51:06] make mothers
[51:07] happy it's not just in our power to make
[51:10] them mothers but to make them to we have
[51:14] what they need and we have the resources
[51:16] so that women aren't laying in bed at
[51:18] night wondering what he's thinking or
[51:20] asking the question is this all but
[51:22] there's some there's some fulfillment
[51:24] that has come with all the demands on
[51:26] their time and Men I'd say you can feel
[51:29] the same way where you work and you
[51:30] labor and you strive and you do all this
[51:32] stuff and you feel like you're just
[51:33] doing it on your own it's when there's a
[51:35] disconnect and you're not in harmony
[51:36] you're not together you're not on the
[51:37] same page and you haven't you haven't at
[51:40] least men and women both striven to to
[51:43] uh strove striven strived to do these
[51:46] things that's something you say this
[51:50] there's got I want something more than
[51:52] just a wife and kids in a house I want
[51:55] something more more than just a husband
[51:57] and children and a house and the more
[52:00] isn't in abandoning them or leaving your
[52:03] calling the more is in coming to your
[52:06] place and as men we can't just
[52:10] demand we can't just say well you just
[52:12] need to find your place you need to get
[52:15] happy with the way I do things but we
[52:17] have to labor in making yes in building
[52:21] that home for the woman brother bam says
[52:24] it takes a real man to admit he's wrong
[52:26] how many
[52:27] men are wrong feel will admit you're
[52:29] wrong how many men will admit they're
[52:30] wrong today well I even got a side eye
[52:34] there
[52:34] like I never claimed to be a man it
[52:38] takes a real man to admit he's wrong
[52:39] when he's wrong we'll admit it I got
[52:41] plenty of hopes for that person when a
[52:43] woman that's wrong and will admit it I
[52:44] got plenty of hopes for her but when
[52:46] they're wrong and won't admit
[52:48] it and the scripture he uses is so
[52:50] amazing he that hides sin or covers sin
[52:52] shall not Prosper he that confesses his
[52:55] sin shall leave Mercy shall have mercy
[52:57] and if you're wrong and know it raise up
[52:59] your hand and say pray for me brother
[53:00] brandham he says God bless you brother
[53:02] another just before prayer this closing
[53:04] this sermon down God bless you lady yes
[53:07] God bless you over here and you lady God
[53:09] Bless you that's real courage to do that
[53:13] now what did I tell you a while ago when
[53:14] I first started when you see a car
[53:15] coming down the road 90 M an hour get
[53:17] out of its way that's right when you see
[53:19] the first twist in anything like that
[53:22] get away from it stay away from it
[53:24] that's the ground you should not be on
[53:27] Satan will present something to you
[53:29] that'll wreck your soul and send you to
[53:30] Hell stay away from it shun the very
[53:33] appearance of evil that's right be a man
[53:37] be a
[53:39] woman these are very direct words I
[53:41] think you can amplify these things for
[53:42] yourself and how that when you see a
[53:44] Twist get away from it Satan will try to
[53:47] get you away from something and it wreck
[53:49] your soul and he says I'm going to take
[53:52] up for the women a minute he said that's
[53:54] unusual isn't isn't it but but they say
[53:56] oh the woman caused it oh it was the
[53:58] woman's fault if she hadn't gotten out
[53:59] of her place well the man wouldn't have
[54:01] got out of his that's true we'll say
[54:03] that's right she gets out of her place a
[54:06] man can't be bad bad L there's a bad
[54:08] woman but remember there can't be a bad
[54:11] woman without being a bad man that's
[54:14] right and then what's remarkable is
[54:16] where if we if we borrow the first way
[54:20] that there cannot be a bad man without
[54:22] there being a bad woman and so we
[54:25] somehow put the blame on the woman for
[54:26] the man being bad he's saying in this
[54:30] analysis the woman only remains
[54:33] bad if the man's bad if he chooses to be
[54:37] bad stay
[54:39] bad and so there is and then also I
[54:41] think conversely can say a woman is bad
[54:43] because a man is bad that's right and
[54:45] you who claim to be a Son of God where's
[54:47] your principles if the woman ain't out
[54:49] of her place aren't you a Son of God
[54:52] aren't you the one that's higher
[54:54] stronger vessel and God says she's
[54:55] weaker than if she's weaker then show
[54:57] yourself a man of
[54:59] God I it's this idea that okay if she's
[55:03] if she's bad if she's done something
[55:04] wrong if she's trying to twist yourself
[55:06] away if she's not in her place he says
[55:08] why don't you be a man of God tell her
[55:10] sister you're wrong that's right I've
[55:11] done it and other Christians have done
[55:13] it and you'll always do it as long as
[55:15] you're a Christian but show yourself a
[55:17] Son of God you're a Son of God says you
[55:20] have more power over yourself than the
[55:22] woman
[55:23] does you have more power over yourself
[55:27] than the woman does if she's weaker
[55:29] recognize her to be weaker understand
[55:31] her mistakes and things like that and
[55:33] try to correct her say sister we're
[55:35] Christians you shouldn't do that be a
[55:37] real man be a Son of God and watch the
[55:40] women there's where the great fall begin
[55:42] at the beginning it was Satan with Eve
[55:44] that's what brought the whole downfall
[55:45] of the human race is through that and if
[55:47] you're a Son of God be strong be a real
[55:50] man if you're not that way stay at the
[55:53] altar till you become that and he says
[55:56] and shun the very appearance of
[56:00] evil somehow I believe regardless of who
[56:03] started it it ends with
[56:04] us that there's a burden of
[56:06] responsibility on us if we even take the
[56:08] analogy of the script of the message of
[56:09] the hour where brother B said a woman
[56:11] started it and she ends it but she only
[56:13] ends it because her
[56:14] bridegroom brings her to the place to do
[56:17] it the man from a position of strength
[56:20] is the one who can get beneath the
[56:21] person that's
[56:22] wrong and brother Bram is not telling us
[56:25] to Lord over them point out their
[56:26] mistakes but as the man who's higher and
[56:29] stronger and her being weaker this is a
[56:31] this is a call to get beneath her and to
[56:33] lift her
[56:35] up and to not go lower to debase
[56:38] yourself if she's wrong then we should
[56:41] stand strong show ourselves as men we've
[56:44] got more power over ourself than the
[56:46] woman does she's weaker we recognize her
[56:48] we understand her mistakes we try to
[56:50] understand her we try to empathize with
[56:52] her we try to have some sort of
[56:53] connection and we do what we can to get
[56:55] beneath her her and lift her up to wash
[56:58] her and to edify
[57:01] her my closing scripture reading is in
[57:04] Titus if you go back to the very
[57:06] beginning of where we read Titus Chapter
[57:08] 2 veres 1 and
[57:10] two we started with verse three the aged
[57:13] women likewise to teach the younger
[57:15] women also but it starts with speak thou
[57:19] the things which become a sound Doctrine
[57:21] and hear these things that the Aged men
[57:24] be sober grave temperate sound in faith
[57:27] in charity and patience in other words
[57:30] the man
[57:31] first the man is addressed first to be
[57:34] sober which is to be vigilant to be
[57:36] watching over your conduct and your
[57:38] conversation to be grave it means to be
[57:39] dignified in behavior and speech and
[57:42] dress there's some levity of life and
[57:44] words and appearance that's why men just
[57:47] aren't to dress any way they want they
[57:49] just don't have a a free run on whatever
[57:52] they want to how they want to look or
[57:53] how they want to act or how they want to
[57:55] talk that the men are to be sober grave
[57:57] temperate I mean self-restrained they're
[57:59] to be discreet not becoming uh monstrous
[58:01] or
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:03] flamboyant cica the younger a
[58:06] philosopher said a young man addicted to
[58:08] a life of luxury
[58:10] transgresses an old man thus addicted
[58:12] runs
[58:13] mad it's Madness it's Insanity for a an
[58:18] aged man to not be sober grave temperate
[58:21] sound in faith charity and
[58:23] impatience despite the Aging of the the
[58:26] body and the mind be sound in faith and
[58:28] charity and
[58:30] patience be sober grave temperate sound
[58:32] and faith and charity and patience these
[58:34] are things that are exhorted of aged men
[58:37] comes to verse six young men likewise
[58:39] exhort to be sober minded and all things
[58:41] showing thyself a pattern of Good Works
[58:43] IND Doctrine showing uncorrupt this
[58:45] gravity sincerity notice the Symmetry to
[58:47] what an aged man is to do sound speech
[58:49] that cannot be condemned that he that is
[58:51] of the contrary part may be ashamed
[58:53] having no evil thing to say of you EX
[58:56] servants to be obedient under their own
[58:57] masters and please them well in all
[58:59] things not answering again not
[59:00] purloining but showing all good Fidelity
[59:03] I wonder the ways that we as spouses
[59:05] perin and show a lack of fidelity that
[59:08] they may Adorn the doctrine our god of
[59:10] God our savior in all things notice how
[59:12] conduct reflects on your Doctrine your
[59:15] religion your faith for the grace of God
[59:16] that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
[59:18] all men teaching us that denying
[59:21] ungodliness and worldly lust we should
[59:22] live soberly righteously and godly in
[59:24] this present world looking for that
[59:27] blessed hope and the Glorious appearing
[59:28] of the great God and our Savior Jesus
[59:30] Christ who gave himself for us this is
[59:32] that husbandry gave himself for us that
[59:34] he might redeem us from all iniquity and
[59:36] purifying unto himself The Peculiar
[59:38] people who are now zealous of good works
[59:41] again in the same way that he exhorted
[59:43] the Elder to be sober grave tempered
[59:45] sound in faith and charity and patience
[59:47] he's now exhorting the same in the men
[59:49] who are young sober minded speaks of
[59:51] self-restraint overcoming the desire to
[59:54] indulge self not self-serving not just
[59:58] merely chasing your own passions your
[59:59] own desires and doing the things that
[1:00:01] make you feel good and coming up with
[1:00:02] excuses for it but be sober minded be
[1:00:04] characterized by Good Works a pattern of
[1:00:06] good work speaks of habit living the
[1:00:09] example that you would expect from
[1:00:10] others especially your own family sound
[1:00:12] and speech is wholesome speech in
[1:00:14] private that pure graceful edifying
[1:00:17] tongue not foolish
[1:00:19] talking denying worldly
[1:00:22] lust living soberly righteously and
[1:00:24] godly rejecting whatever is contrary to
[1:00:26] the fear and love of
[1:00:28] God living soberly is that the whole
[1:00:31] temperament of a person not the Folly of
[1:00:33] ignorance not the disorderly passions
[1:00:35] not just doing what you want to do but
[1:00:37] you live sober not inflamed not driven
[1:00:40] zealous of Good Works doing and
[1:00:42] promoting good amen let me say this as I
[1:00:45] close this is
[1:00:47] character and it's this type of
[1:00:49] character that'll build an atmosphere
[1:00:50] that makes a woman feel at
[1:00:53] home men are to lift their wives up not
[1:00:56] put them down and Paul said that we are
[1:00:58] to dwell with our wives according to
[1:01:00] honor Peter rather according to
[1:01:01] knowledge giving honor as unto a week
[1:01:04] weaker vessel being heirs together so
[1:01:06] there's this this uh full picture that
[1:01:08] he's expressing that your prayers be not
[1:01:10] hindered I said Brothers the way you
[1:01:12] treat your wife and
[1:01:14] children is determining your spiritual
[1:01:17] success our spiritual SE success our
[1:01:20] relationship with God our closeness to
[1:01:23] the Lord depends upon these things
[1:01:27] a woman is not put in her place by
[1:01:30] demanding it by telling her to do it she
[1:01:34] is not placed by
[1:01:38] force but let me say this she will
[1:01:40] willingly move into her position when
[1:01:43] the word is
[1:01:45] expressed because her place is to be at
[1:01:49] home her place we can or places in the
[1:01:52] home no her place her sense of belonging
[1:01:55] her f her happiness is to be at
[1:01:59] home would you tell someone to make
[1:02:01] themselves at home you're you're
[1:02:03] speaking that there should be some
[1:02:05] safety a relaxing a letting down of
[1:02:08] guard
[1:02:10] trust a an understanding a
[1:02:14] support and so her place is to be at
[1:02:17] home I'm not talking about getting in
[1:02:19] the kitchen and doing the
[1:02:22] dishes I'm talking about a man who has
[1:02:24] the kind of character that creates the
[1:02:26] kind of place where when she's there she
[1:02:30] can be at
[1:02:32] home brother the brothers if they could
[1:02:34] come to their instruments and the sermon
[1:02:35] recognizing your day and its message
[1:02:36] brother says Israel's back in her
[1:02:39] Promised
[1:02:40] Land she don't know how she got back
[1:02:42] there she was just automatically put
[1:02:44] back there National Force put her in her
[1:02:46] place now I'm going to say something
[1:02:48] National Force put Israel and her
[1:02:50] Homeland National Force will put the
[1:02:52] church and the World Council churches
[1:02:53] said look it's National Force external
[1:02:56] forces that's going to put Israel in
[1:02:58] their Homeland the church and the World
[1:03:00] Council churches he says but the power
[1:03:03] of God will put the people in The Bride
[1:03:06] it's not force it's power the world
[1:03:09] force is this way and the world forces
[1:03:10] that way but God forces upward the
[1:03:12] spirit of God which is the word of God
[1:03:13] my word is spirit and life will put the
[1:03:15] bride in her place because she'll
[1:03:17] recognize her position in the word then
[1:03:20] she's in Christ we put her in her place
[1:03:22] no National Force will do it no National
[1:03:23] Force did Drive Israel to the though
[1:03:25] Force did Drive Israel to her Homeland
[1:03:27] the national forces of the council
[1:03:29] churches will drive every organization
[1:03:30] into it but the power of God will raise
[1:03:33] the bride into Glory out of it let me
[1:03:37] say this on Mother's Day as men as men a
[1:03:40] man can draw the woman into her position
[1:03:43] by expressing
[1:03:46] Christ the expression of the character
[1:03:48] of Christ will welcome her
[1:03:51] home draw her out of her clamor draw her
[1:03:55] out of her Stu stubbornness that's the
[1:03:56] danger so much anymore when we just give
[1:03:58] into our natural inclinations is uh her
[1:04:01] stubbornness will breed our harshness
[1:04:03] and her unwillingness to to feel at home
[1:04:06] and to make home and those things only
[1:04:07] cause us to be become more obstinate and
[1:04:09] harsh and it just forces and forces and
[1:04:11] forces but let me say this to you today
[1:04:13] as men there's a recipe in the scripture
[1:04:16] of God in First Peter and Titus and
[1:04:18] Timothy there's recipes for us as men
[1:04:21] that we can begin to cook and I say let
[1:04:24] them cook let the Men start doing the
[1:04:27] things that they ought to do and it'll
[1:04:30] draw the woman into her position when
[1:04:33] the word is
[1:04:34] expressed brother B says the word will
[1:04:37] she'll recognize her position the word
[1:04:39] the word is spirit and life it puts the
[1:04:41] bride in her place when it's expressed
[1:04:42] by the man it'll make the woman feel
[1:04:45] feel at
[1:04:47] home and I say the man has the primary
[1:04:51] responsibility for building that
[1:04:54] home and for those those who are not
[1:04:57] married or those who have
[1:04:59] marriages that are separated if one even
[1:05:03] a man or woman finds themselves not in
[1:05:05] this traditional model you may know
[1:05:07] better than
[1:05:08] anybody just exactly what we're talking
[1:05:12] about just how hard it can
[1:05:15] be in the absence of certain
[1:05:20] things I'll say this a woman wants to be
[1:05:22] at
[1:05:23] home not merely in the
[1:05:26] kitchen she wants to know she belongs
[1:05:29] she has a place she has support and
[1:05:33] she's not
[1:05:34] alone let's give our wives and mothers
[1:05:38] the best gift we can give them and
[1:05:40] that's the gift of a
[1:05:42] home by being more understanding and
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:48] sympathetic because her place is to be
[1:05:50] at
[1:05:51] home and I promise you husbands and
[1:05:54] children you're the ones that have the
[1:05:58] power to make her feel at
[1:06:01] home it's in your power will you accept
[1:06:04] the responsibility for it will men
[1:06:07] accept the responsibility for it are
[1:06:08] there any husbands here want to stand
[1:06:09] and say I'm going to I'm going to make a
[1:06:12] home I'm going to make my wife feel at
[1:06:13] home husbands who want to do that let's
[1:06:15] stand say I'm I want to make my
[1:06:18] wife to be at home
