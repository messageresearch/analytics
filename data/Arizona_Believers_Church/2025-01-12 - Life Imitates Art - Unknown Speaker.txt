TRANSCRIPT
========================================
John chapter 1 verses 1 to5 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God this has to be one of the most outstanding scriptures uh to go back to before creation even that's right because Genesis 1:1 starts with creation now this is going all the way back and before there was anything but Elohim by himself the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not amen may God just bless these words which we've read this morning from his scripture you may be seated the next verses uh begin to reference John a man's sent from God who came to bear witness of the light that through the light all men might believe and then John being the Forerunner and it describing uh him as the one that would give witness then it comes to the word made flesh in Jesus Christ as you would read through that and I think these are very uh these are scriptures that are worthy of our attention and I'd like to read a statement from brother Brandon when he gives his life story in 1950 and I'm just reading this kind of just to pull something through from Wednesday night for those of you who missed it he said I believe that when God woke Adam up to look at Eve she was the most beautiful thing that eyes had ever looked at and this is in all of creation and Adam having already named the animals and we were seeing how Adam and doing that that was a creative act there was something involved in seeing what God had formed and then being inspired to name it and in doing that there was some impression even he as an artist and as a creator as a God on Earth was creating and even giving character and certain things to that he was making an impression and now that he has seen every living thing when the woman steps forth he he looks at it and he knows there's nothing else more beautiful in all the world than this creature this one that is before him the most beautiful thing he ever looked at he says it goes to show that man even to this day the desire in man craves to look at a beautiful woman and so there is something in a man that he can when he sees a beautiful woman is an attraction to him it has a a draw and a power on him now we know it's in there that Satan has perverted that and has used it as a great detriment to men and women and he says why because that strain comes down through that time like that that was given Plum from the Garden of Eden God having established in Genesis chapter 1 the law of reproduction Let each seed bring forth of its kind I believe that you could look at here in Genesis and say that this was God's original Law of Attraction and how that in seeing this woman and how beautiful she was it inspired him to Proclaim bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman this creative act of naming her woman because Adam was created to create God having not been created but a Creator when he made Man In His Image this self-portrait he had given him a god likeness and a glory of God to where he could also likewise create and so that's the original image and then when Adam comes uh Falls and he loses that glory in Jesus Christ comes as the word made flesh he is uh showing that everything Adam lost in the fall can be restored back not just to one son but brother said to Mankind and so this is uh we I believe as the New Creations in Christ Jesus are likewise created to create now I want to use a phrase today as my title life imitates art and and you may be familiar with this statement I had done some studying on it where it originates and I think it I don't know if it's amongst creatives and I'm not a creative I'm just a poser I'm just on the outside listening and there's phrases and there's certain times these things are pointed out that life imitates art and so something happens and like that's exactly the way that this happened in this book or this movie or this portrayal and so there's this thought that life imitates art now in its origin where it came from it was suggesting that artistic Creations influence human behavior and people's perceptions and this is originally written in 1889 I found a place where Mark Twain actually gave h a similar speech and made some declarations to Harvard in 1891 believe he was kind of riffing on this original phrase that life imitates art and how art and those things that man produces through his creativity influences human behavior and how they see things and the way be came up was in the context of kind of an ongoing social debate about the uh decay of culture and how that Society was breaking down and urbanization and industrialization was changing the Victorian uh society and things were no longer as they were and where there was a lot of Pomp and Circumstance and a lot of politeness and a lot of social graces and observations if you've ever read uh a Jane Aus novel then you know there's a lot of weird formalities and the way people talked and the way people lived and things that would take place in those areas and now through industrialization and this urbanization a lot of things were being lost and part of the dispute was amongst different uh Styles or philosophies on Art in terms of Romanticism and portraying things in a way that was very romantic but then realism where it was like these are potato Farmers this is what they look like this is what they do and so there was just kind of a dispute between those of what's real art and what should art be and I'm just kind of pulling back the curtain this is how the sausage made I hope you don't mind mind this today but in studying these different periods and these artistic disciplines and and some of the uh attitude towards art and what it should do it struck me how that you could see a certain Beauty in uh whether it be a baroque or Romanticism or realism or impressionism and you can see that there's definitely creativity and beauty and then the if they begin to argue you can appreciate this side and you can appreciate that side and sometimes their approach in the very same subject wanting to accomplish the very same thing but they're wanting to do it very very different ways and they have different conclusions that they arrive to and I realize wow it is so important to have an absolute so important to say that whether I'm a romantic or whether I'm a realist or whether I'm an impressionist or whatever style I might be or whatever way there's got to be an absolute that everyone could come back to and say in the end this is what is actually truth and that I'm not just romanticizing a lie and I just don't want to give the impression of of falsehood but I I need to something at the end of the day needs to uphold what is really true and so no matter how much Beauty uh art can have no matter how much measure of Truth it can have it's only in God's word that we find full truth and genuine Beauty in in in the original is where we find it Satan cannot create and in that way when artists create they don't create the same way that God has they're using exist exting things and their creativity is either going to be a representation of something genuine or a perversion of something genuine and so only God's word holds full Beauty and Truth I'd read this statement many many years ago by Thomas Fuller was he wrote a book a piscus site of Palestine he wrote it in 1650 it's a rather uh very complete work about uh Israel and uh to say a pisca view he's saying this is how Moses view as he looked out over Palestine uh what are the borders and what's the geography and what is Israel what is belongs to it and he made this statement in this book he said next to God the word I love the word of God I thought that was I like that symmetry with John 1:1 next to God the word I love the word of God so he says God the word and then next to that I love the Bible I love the word I profess myself a pure leveler Desiring all human conceits though built on specious bottoms may be laid flat if opposing the written word now put that on a bumper sticker you you might need a a Suburban for enough space for that but that to me is worth uh contemplating that I love the word of God and I'm a I'm a pure leveler like John came to make the High Low Places High and the high places low and level things out he says I think any human idea or ambition or conceit though it might have he says specious bottoms that would be deceptively attractive foundations something that is superficially plausible but in reality not true so it's misleading in its appearance though it might have some beauty in its foundation it might have some Allure attraction its representation it should be leveled it should be taken apart and dismantled if it opposes the written word and I believe that that's the very sentiment that brother brandom expressed over and over again this truth that the Bible is our absolute and that his ministry in a large part was leveling out things that were human conceits and tradition building back up things that had been dug out and as we look at any of these things as we're just using uh maybe art as an example as we draw it from the message of the hour of the desire of God the premise of the hour that we're living in now we have to realize it it's all got to come back to the word of God no matter how beautiful or attractive it is and so it was this thought that struck me about the absolute and about the word of God and how that no matter how beautiful something can be if it doesn't if it is opposes the written word if it opposes the word then it should be dismantled it should be taken apart and so this statement of Life imitates art of this phrase it speaks of the influence of Art and that could be literature it could be movies books podcast videos uh any type of creation uh the creators the influencers so just it's might be more relevant today than ever before because all it takes is a certain influencer to do something and then everybody else is doing it and some of the most insane childish things uh maybe we should do a whole series on it's it's a prank bro right uh but there is um uh there is an influence by social media there's an influence in literature and podcast and books and all sorts of things on human expression and and how people begin to live lives and be disciplined and eat only raw liver and and drink only water uh based upon an influence an image something that's been portrayed to them and so the phrase life imitates art I think we can see this truth in it that it alludes to this powerful role that whether we want to say content creation or social media or just art plays in shaping Society culture and individuals people will model their actions and their behaviors and their attitudes based upon what they see in this created content and therefore art provides this framework by which people uh can interpret the world and engage in the world and so you use this as your Paradigm this is the lens through which I'm going to view things whatever this influencer says or whatever this personality says or whatever this uh uh ideology says and so through this art and through these representations we'll interpret the world and we'll interact and engage with it that way and it's true I think we could all agree to this that many times people individuals and maybe to a larger extent Society derive their inspiration from certain things that are created and I see I think we see this a lot with movies and so these works of arts and whether they be themes or scenarios or even visual representations this life imitate imitates art means that there's certain things that are portrayed in art that end up playing out in society and they say well that is just like this scenario and so it's like life now begins to impersonate and reflect art now this comes from a an observation an essay written by Oscar wild he is by no means uh this is may be one instance with I won't say brother Oscar but uh he wrote an observation he called the decay of lying and we might think yes like we're getting we're getting to the truth and he said life imitates art far more than art imitates life which I find striking because we would think that what art and the real purpose of art what it held in days gone by where we didn't have as much of the actual photographs and videos and things and the ability to travel like we do today you experience things through ART and so art was to be a representation of life in one sense but he says art uh imitates does not imitate life as much as life imitates art this results not merely from life's imitative Instinct we all have this IM instinct to imitate and I think that's true but from the fact that the self conscious aim of life is to find expression and I would agree with Oscar in this as well that we have this desire to express ourselves it's even this unconscious aim that want to find out who I am my identity I want to I want to have some kind of identity and he says art offers that offers beautiful forms through which that energy can be realized so I want to express myself you see a representation like I want to be a skater you know or you see this I want to be that there's a way that it influences us and shapes our Behavior so people express the things they are inspired by I hope you can really pick up what I'm laying down now in terms of the way we live our lives the way we dress the way we Act and the way the things that we support is we will express the things and we will portray the things we are inspired by and Oscar wild had two boys young boys at this time and he was used in the example of what he called silly boys who will read some sort of literature or some sort of fiction of Bandits or whatever and dress in a certain way and how they would uh act out what they had read in these adventure stories and at the end of the day it wasn't just observations of kids it was a really a critique of uh of adults but he came to this conclusion that the proper aim of art should be tell the telling of beautiful untrue things he's advocating for lying and he's saying that the reason why modern literature is decaying and the reason why modern literature and culture is in De flying and being corrupted is because the decaying of lying as an art was responsible it's it's a it it boggles my mind in the sense that he's saying uh that the reason why Society is in such Decay is because we're not lying good enough and he said if something cannot be done to check or at least to modify our monstrous worship of facts art will become sterile and Beauty will pass away from the land and this is wild there's a certain ring of truth to it yet there's something missing that's not quite right like we read it you're thinking yeah yeah but like how can we get back to true beauty through line and that's why I think you got to come back to an absolute to say well maybe we don't know what true beauty is unless we have a true measure of it unless we know what the original is and the way things are something that has true true Symmetry and not just Laing tricks on our minds because though it may be built on some attractive premise if it's a lie it should be dismantled if it's a lie it should not be uh believed and those who are trying wanting to put on a mask or those whose lifestyles are not acceptable according to the word of God surely they'd want to be able to build an art and create an art that would allow us to romanticize something that's not true so that we can live a lie and call it beautiful Jeremiah 23: 9-12 this scripture to me really hits on what Oscar wild was fantasizing about is this idea that art should lie and in line we should believe the lie be inspired by the lie and produce the LIE replicate the LIE live the LIE the prophet says my heart is broken because of the prophets my heart is broken my heart within me is broken because the prophets all my bones Shake I am like a drunken man and like a man whom my wine hath overcome so this this is a debilitating understanding because of the Lord and because of the words of his Holiness this is stimulation a revelation but there's a Brokenness that has come within it there's this heaviness that comes upon him he says this for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth this swearing is a false oath because of lying the land Mourns because of lying the pleasant places of the Wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not right their course is their mode their style their life and then it says and I found that their uh force is not right their might or their influence their leadership this is where if we say life imitates art and we want the Art of Lying as if we can have a very rough a a robust and and uh strong form of this art where we can lie through our creation then life will imitate that and we'll have more beautiful things and the prophet is saying no because of ly because of the influence of the lies because of the influence of these false representation their mode their style their life think of this their course is evil their force is not right their influence these are the things that would shape Society the individual if art is influencing life he's saying the LIE is not producing a beautiful output he says for both prophet and priest are profane that means Godless a man that is devoid of God produces a vanity can only produce a deceptive Beauty something very shallow though it might have an attraction to it though it might appeal to some level on our in our flesh it say that they are profane and anybody who study art or anybody who's been Googling art as of late will find that there is a tremendous uh debate within art between the sacred and the profane he says yay in my house have I found their wickedness sayeth the Lord wherefore their way shall be unto them as a SL as slippery ways in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for I will bring evil upon them even the year their visitation saith the Lord deceit and lies produced says a Barren landscape the pleasant places of the Wilderness are dry up because a style that was evil because of an influence that was not right devoid of Truth and they could not have true life because they were not bringing it from the genuine inspiration of the Lord uh they could not the landscape what was being produced what they were sewing and what was bringing forth was devoid of true life and it did not have any real Beauty I know that when we read this and we say well the wildernesses are dried up and and all it's dried up it's burnt over we might even say well the the that the prophet had a vision of the United States of America Burnt Over in nothing but Ash and we'd say that hasn't happen in a physical sense but with every day there's another ember in a spiritual sense of something that has been burned down and be reduced to ashes that in a in a worldly sense oh we've never been healthier we've never been more beautiful we've never been more powerful but in a spiritual sense we have never been more Barren and dried up there's never been a time of a greater famine for the word amen amen amen and there's no light I hope this isn't too much of a hard turn here but there's no light where they are and so in the absence of light they can use their imagination they can imagine beautiful things in the absence of light they can surmise that this is a great thing and this is wonderful and they can use the benefit of Darkness to convince themselves that all is well and everything's beautiful and this is a perfect Revelations 317 description now in Genesis 1: 1:3 and still wanting to consider this phrase life imitates art as Oscar wild and his debate with the realist was proposing that since life is influenced by Art we should make art Beautiful by lying through lying let's not be so real let let's present things that people can romanticize about fantasize about and then portray and hopefully reshape society and in that way saying that the that which is created or that which comes forth should influence uh The Observer now in Genesis CH 1 veres 1 to3 we've looked at this verse one quite a bit and uh we had set this up for Wednesday night but we've moved it to today in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light God having created the Heaven and the Earth and brought it forth by his word and he stretched out things by his hand we see those things very uh specifically set forth in scripture now we get a a description of God's creation and the Earth was without form and and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep so there was a that word without form and void it speaks of a vanity it was a place of chaos one word Is A Wasteland and to be in Darkness Darkness upon the face of the deep it was obscure and hidden so from the as in terms of what could be beheld and what could be seen or processed by perception the Earth had no form it was a wasteland it was chaotic it was the darkness had obsc ured and hidden the the earth now we can say well that doesn't sound like something God would create but yet God in the first iteration of creation as it's described in terms of Heaven and Earth there's this vanity it's a wasteland it's obscure H shrouded in darkness and if I could say this the potential of that creation was hidden the the beauty of it was in darkness it's not perceptible it can't be seen but he says and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters where the darkness was the spirit of God moves and it speaks let there be light and there was light and what light did is light be to reveal the shape and the form and the order and the symmetry of God's creation that where there was Darkness where there's darkness by default there's chaos you could probably be led into a room with nothing in it I say probably I'm not insinuating that you will be but if you were led into a dark room room with nothing in it no windows no source of light and locked the door and sealed out all the light you would know beforehand there's nothing in here but as soon as you're shrouded into complete darkness you can begin to imagine anything you want and if you were led into a and and be uncomfortable I think some of the sensory deprivation things that are available nowadays they say some of the scariest things that you can be engaged in now imagine being thrust Into Darkness immediately without any knowledge beforehand of what exist and so where a formation appears to you to be something uh unfamiliar and you don't know what it is God when he originally created I think it's beautiful to put it in this point we having experienced creation if somebody says what is that over there you go well that's a mountain what is that over that's a tree and we could understand but having no knowledge beforehand what God had created in the darkness could have appeared to be very chaotic and I'm not Sugg sugesting that God in the beginning created everything as it was but we know the seeds are all laying there and it's light they begin to reveal God's creation and light is intrinsic in art if it wasn't I could be a fantastic artist right I can just paint a black panel but isn't that beautiful and it's amazing what goes for art these days Vincent Van go was writing to his brother Theo about and talking about a night scene a night effect and he was painting something at night and here he was painting at night and he said still a great deal of light falls on everything why because even at night there's some source of light and because of that light you can see things even at the very depths of the sea I was having an ongoing debate with one of the AI engines about light and and they kept saying that there's virtually no light in the deepest depths of the the scene it's like you're saying there's virtually none so does that mean there's some and they'd say by saying that I'm meaning that there's a very there's uh not really light and they keep saying it away it's like just tell me yes or no and the whole internet broke and even down in the very deepest depths of the sea there's light through bioluminescence and and though uh chat GP teeth may think that everything in light is absorbed they still hold open this window that probably some Vis invisible spectrums of light invisible to our eye that's down there in the depths and the darkest places that allows life to grow and so a great deal of light falls on everything in the beginning God created the light he said let there be light as the light begin to shine things begin to become clear the Bible says in Ephesians 5:13 but all things that are reproved are made man manifest By the Light something is proven Vindicated made sure convincing you turn on the light what is it that I see what is that what is that you look out your window as a child and you see something in the dark and you're not sure I think there's a really large Indian chief standing in the backyard mom turn on the light turn on the light I speak from experience and the light shines and it's a tree why because it makes manifest for whatsoever doth make manifest is light now if you are I know you're familiar with the sermons of Shalom and those different principles that brother bam is using and there's a man here who can turn on light that light brings Life Light brings Life Light brought to life the beauty of God's creation had God proceeded with creation without verse uh three here and he continues to create let's just uh suspend maybe our knowledge of the scripture and maybe the spiritual logic and just say well God created and he never brought forth light and everything came forth and you would have tremendous Beauty but it would be completely imperceptible the very first thing God had to bring forth was light because light brought to life creation the beauty of the art of God was only going to be discernible as light that he created by the spoken word would shine upon it brother B said let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in its season it's The Shining of the light brother bam says without light there cannot be life it takes light to bring things to life let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in its season in John chap 1 veres 1 to5 as we read this in our text it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God so the word is God there's no way around this it's not two it's one the word is God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him the word god without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men amen and then this phrase and this statement which holds true to Jesus Christ who comes upon the Earth is the word made flesh and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not it's a this sentence is so heavy in its riches that just you know a casual observation doesn't do its justice but the light shineth in darkness there was darkness in the beginning the spirit of God began to move and God said let there be light and the Darkness could not overtake it the darkness could not seize it it could not withstand it it light was greater than Darkness you cannot achieve Darkness uh by throwing Darkness at light you need the absence of light to have Darkness so darkness is only Power existed in the absence of light and so when light shined in the Darkness Darkness could not obtain it could not overtake it could not seize it and it so Darkness shining uh where darkness is and the light shines it cannot comprehend it it cannot understand it can not perceive it is also part of the understand of the part of the meaning there but life is the light and the life was the light of men it is light that reveals God's Beauty it is life that is the light that reveals God's Beauty art as I've been using it to in the sense of painting and creation of that kind type of medium where it's maybe paint on canvas or watercolor through some sort of sketching we're using the that visual medium so far in terms of art but without color there is no art someone's going to challenge me on that I just know somebody just unfollowed but color is the interaction between light and matter and as light strikes something that's either absorbed transmitted or reflected and it's through those qualities that you you get these different uh a different perception of light perception of light is what gives us color from the as light strikes the surface of an object as it is either transmitted reflected or absorbed that's what gives you the sense of color and for different ones not that anyone here would be colorblind but those who are colorblind know that there can be colors but through the lack of perception where the cones are absent or whatever is not there it cannot discern a light doesn't mean the light's not shining doesn't mean the color is not true but the perception is inaccurate and so colors characterized by Hue and by value and by intensity whether not it's bright or dull or whether how light or dark it is or whether it's red green yellow or blue those are the and then you create your colors from those things colors as they're used together can complement one another they can harmonize or they can be distracting disconcordant but color cannot exist without light the absence of light is total darkness and where there is no light where there's no light source it is impossible to perceive colors color cannot exist without light without light everything would just appear black which black is essentially the absence of light in the visible spectrum so when God said let there be light is is the only way possible to see the beauty of his Creation in the beginning was the word and creation came by the word of God and as God is creating by the spoken word creation becomes his language he's expressing something in his creation there was a transformation of the spoken word which God create created by there was a transformation of his word into living things and it's for that reason that as God created by the spoken word we can actually look back and see that history has been his voice that throughout time as God had created and brought forth creation Now the things that have been are speaking for him the living things that have been have been his voice I'm not I'm not wanting to get away from this phrase the life was the light of men but I'm wanting you to think about how God in the beginning when he created in the beginning was the word and the word brought forth creation and he shined his light upon that and it became his voice it became his testimony and all of creation now speaks for God as an artist in Romans 1: 18-25 for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men these are the conceits of man that are not based upon truth but a lie he says who hold the truth in unrighteousness whether we appreciate the beauty of the lie or we are the creators of it he's saying that God's Wrath is going to be poured out upon those who perverted God's Beauty those that have perverted nature those that have perverted mankind those that have perverted the word because they hold things that are true but they've changed them into unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God has showed it unto them that's quite a statement God has already showed them certain things that which can be known of God has already been shown to them you following this what can be known of God in other words it's not that God has showed him his entirety but God has shown them things about himself for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen there are certain invisible things about God that have can be clearly seen in creation being understood by the things that are made invisible things of God are understood by the things that he made even his eternal power and godhead God's eternal power and his office as God his Singularity as God is revealed or made known in that which he created so the invisible God has a voice amen we can say that God's language was translated into substance and form God's word became life in creation so that they are without excuse Paul is saying you don't have to go any further than creation nothing else that would come from it but creation itself to know that there is a God that's why the one that says there is no God is a fool and that's like why they hide it behind their religion which is called science science well let me just say it this way I know I fellowship with this before on with with some people here in the church I don't know if I've ever mentioned it from the pulpit uh but I'm known for repeating myself quite frequently I'm known for repeating myself quite frequently and I'd made this this when it comes to Creation to those that deny creation and they have their Theory what they want you to do is just give them Faith just let me just have faith in one proposition just give me an exus and one unprovable proposition and I can prove to you everything else right just I can't prove to you how the world was created just accept by faith that this is how it happened so just excuse me on this and I can prove to you everything else it's a religion just like any anything else and they are without excuse by denying that creation itself reveals the eternal power and godhead of the one true Lord because that when they knew god well how do they know him by his creation they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish T was darkened if I could say this is where man being created to create you used his own imagination and his Foolish Heart to create things that were not true and did not glorify God professing themselves to be wise they became fools science Arts philosophies all those things that would not arrive back finally to the fact that there is one true God his word is true and even if they're wrestling I say there is a Divine creator of all things there must be one certain absolute we're trying to find him and and and reach him and know who he is and and even as they erected the altar to the unknown God Paul is saying you're foolish because God has made himself known through his word through creation but through their own vain uh creativity they didn't glorify God professing themselves to be wise they become fools and change the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible men and to birds and to four-footed beast and creeping things this would be the worship of things other than God a portrayal and an expression of God as something other than who he actually was I know that there's more that I could could be said about this in terms of the centuries and the thousands of years of art that represent would give representation of gods or that they fashioned on the side of a wall or through stone or through uh uh wood and they worship that and notice how they go wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own own bodies between themselves why is such filth and perversion so rampant because they change the truth of God into a lie verse 25 who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen if I could say this way creation was the light the original light that man rejects that if you reject the very premise that God created the heavens and the Earth the very evidence of God if you reject him there you can produce nothing but vanity no matter how sincere your uh your Ambitions may be and no matter how kind to humanity you may be if you reject the basis that God created the heavens and the earth that is the original light that man rejects certainly if you reject that you can't reject that Jesus Christ was the Son of God the son light they change the truth of God into a lie they the LIE produced a reality a vanity and go all the way back to the fall and a lie produced perversion It produced death and as Fallen mankind they worship that which is created by man more than God the Creator who created man the influences the images the opportunities the the titles they worship and serve the creature they they they they'll worship and serve the art produced by Fallen man more than they do God the Creator and now Paul is specifically making the point that they worship the Sun and the Moon and the four-footed Beast and they worship things that God created and therefore it leads to this lust and dishonoring their bodies between themselves it's why we've entered into such a gross perverted age but the life is the light of where this Darkness has allowed for the truth of God to be changed into a lie for ungodliness and unrighteousness to obscure and hide the truth to where thou the invisible things of God that should be made made known through creation are so watered down and obscure and so twisted and perverted that man gives themselves over to a corruptible image John chapter 9: 4 to5 in the beginning was the word the word brought forth life and the life was the light of men the light shined in darkness and darkness cannot stop light where there's light there can be perceptible color think of that where there's any kind of light any kind of light it will reflect it will show if there's any color to be seen John chap 9: 4 and 5 he says I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day The Works of him works there could even refer to a work of art anything that's produced whether artistic or literary or otherwise I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world to better understand this scripture and those who may be the third shift and those are like hey I can I can get work done at night let us just think that if you're trying to bring forth the image and see it in its beauty and its correctness there must be light families who do family pictures you can't just take pictures at any time of the day when it's most convenient the lighting has got to be just right oh there was a lot of men's voices there the sisters are afraid to shout I thought I was going to hear tongues to be honest with you right that we put so much effort into getting the lighting right oh the lighting's bad on this and this is you got to be facing this way and that's too harsh and that's too many shadows and listen Brothers it's true right if you want a good family picture uh as much as I'm praying and believing that AI will get there where you just have to feed in certain metrics right I just want to stand in front of a camera take my take my passport photo and produce a beautiful family picture in front of a Saro and get everybody in there how me some in really nice expensive clothes I never have to smile one time except for the first photo now that lighting is so important in producing an accurate reflection of what it really is and that's why when you see something with your eye and you're like wow that Moon is beautiful and you pull your phone out to take a picture like what did I just take a picture of why do I even bother because the lens is not able to absorb the light to take advantage of the light in order to replicate and produce what is there so is the work I must work the works of him that sent me while is day it's not just a matter of getting the job done it's a matter of getting it done right it's not a matter of saying it's finished but it's getting it finished correctly and accurately as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world there's nothing that can be done right without the light here we can see this beautiful representation of the artwork of God the creation of God and that light is intrinsic in art without light there's not color here he's saying I am the light of the world as long as I am in the world that is where God's light is he was in the world and that was the one true light at that time when Jesus Christ as a man is on Earth with the father dwelling in him and he's doing these many wonderful works and he's uh performing these signs and wonders there was light no nowhere else to be found anywhere else in him he was the light of the world God manifested in his son he was the visible expression of the invisible God and he was light because he manifested God you could say that the light of the world was creation then the light of the world is is then the one that God creates the Son of God God the way the truth the life Revelations 3:14 says and under the angel of the Church of the Le Deans right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I believe there is a very deliberate specific reason why this designation of the beginning of the creation of God comes forth here to the Leo Dean Church age because it's when God's creation is going to be finished Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God not in the beginning was the word but when the word word now is formed in the womb of Mary and that God thou brings forth a child which is in the form of man in the fashion of man but the blood is the blood of God the flesh though it can die was the it was deity that that body represented and the life that was in him the zoy life was the light of men God who was The Giver of Life was manifested in the flesh so God is identifying himself again in his creation and that creation is light the Bible says in Isaiah 53: 1 to3 I feel necessary to share this because the concepts of beauty and what we find attractive we have different varieties amongst us I read it on Wednesday night I even felt maybe after I read it I like man I I feel like I maybe should take more time explaining what uh Pascal may be meant by this in terms we have these Tendencies to think something's beautiful and if we're if we have that bent and that's the way that our our Ting is our sound is then we think that's beautiful and you see something else like I don't know man I've been to the Grand Canyon just a big hole in the ground flip it upside down let me climb it that's Beauty right and that's what people would think like there's something that goes up that's beautiful and other people see something it's just the varieties and what one finds attractive the way it strikes them and so I realize there this debased perception of beauty that is merely carnal and some people just the certain foods they just absolutely love love it love it love it love love it and other people absolutely hate it and and there that's profane that's all it is it's profane it's God's not any more in a rolled burrito than he is in a a cabbage roll right but Isaiah 53: 1:3 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed great questions Paul picks this up where who who's the one that sees it who's the one that caught the Revelation upon whom has the light shined for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root of a dry out of a dry ground so you think well that's there's some use there for sure there's there's there's something marvelous there's something beautiful a tender plant of root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor cless not quite without form and void but the form and the cless that man would want to see and a leader and a ruler and a beautiful person's not there and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him when man sees him in his flesh when man sees him in his stature when he sees him not necessarily for what he is but for how they are perceiving the light there is no Beauty the beauty there doesn't necessarily refer to something beautiful as it would may be even in the garden but it's just the appearance or the spectacle the thing seen there's nothing seen or the appearance of him doesn't cause us to desire him may say that there's no Beauty it means he was ugly and he was ferocious looking but rather his features didn't Stand Out is something to be desired I know the first question that all the sisters would ask is Jesus Christ or how tall are you right if he's not over six foot you don't want to have anything to do with him but there is it to me that kind of encapsulates that you would look at like nah you know it doesn't look like a leader much to me he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief he has no form or comeliness he has no attraction he has no appearance that he's desirable and then and we hid as it were our face from him it's you don't you don't gaze you turn away he was despised and we esteemed we could not appreciate we could not value him we esteemed him not this is Jesus Christ the beginning of the creation of God when he comes into the world God who has formed and fashioned man not Adam made over but a new creation a a a a a quickening a a quickening power not just a living being but one with power Beauty and Grandeur the very Heart Of God expressed God does it through such Simplicity that when you saw him you just turned away I would say that even in one sense it's not even that you shrieked in horror but you that's nothing special on a scale of 1 to 10 what would you rate Jesus I don't know four and a half no form no attraction the spectacle of him it was nothing that was St man did you see that guy preaching the other day he was he was this tall and he was dressed this way and he had such a way I mean there's some preachers I would listen to them just for their voice that's right hey just you could just if Charlie Brown's mom sounded like that right right right right you could just listen to it all day long I love the sound of that they say some of the greatest preachers in days gone by their voices were whiny they were fat and short and praise the Lord B but yet it was the word that was the attraction now I need to hurry in the sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Bram says in Hebrews 138 the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he says do you believe that's inspired Lord willing maybe that one of the next Services coming up I want deal with inspiration do you believe that's inspired he says I believe that is the truth at the Judgment Day God will see that that is truth God will stand behind what he says to be truth this is one of rembrance portrayals of Christ This is a Rembrant head of Christ knowing what I know about the message of the hour and' say that there's a very striking picture being painted of what Christ may have looked like sorry to all the arens he didn't have blonde hair and blue eyes and now let's just wonder what type of person Jesus was now the ones in this slide they're all rembrance paintings I think there I found five of them I think they're all just strikingly beautiful he says now let's just wonder what type of person Jesus was now I'm showing you rbrand a a very gifted artist who is portraying through his gifts and his talents and through the use of color and this composition and everything he's trying to P portray an image of Christ and maybe just through even the the tilting of his head and the clasping of his hands h and maybe some sort of halo effect by the the shading behind his head he's trying to portray Jesus Christ maybe not in the sacred way maybe in a more profane way where it's like where where's the light and the angels and where's all the infant cherubs around them and all these Grandeur things no it's a very simple humble portrait of Christ so let's wonder what type of person Jesus was as we look at the picture and try to deduce what kind of person he was we're left to a man's impression of what Christ was what he looked like to determine what he is brother says now I know we have some theological ideas and some painters that's painted pictures listen to this please but let's not look at him in the picture form tonight cuz we might not knowall if that if if if that I would even go so far to say if that was actually a picture of him we could we could worship the picture instead of the one but let's look at him in his life his spirit I I I I really appreciate this one I think it's a all all again all these are by done by Rin but let's look at him in his spirit in his life his spirit think of this so Jesus when he comes back to Earth again in his body form it'll be way too late then for us to think anything about it this is staggering to me this is so it so opens up more to me the value of the message of the hour opens up more to me the value of Revelation the value of really knowing god through his word and through the the ways in which he wants to make himself known I could learn the picture enough to know that's exactly what Jesus looks like but if I saw that image in the flesh it'd be too late to know anything about him if that's all I gained in my knowledge of him is the the the artist perfect replication of what he might have looked like he says we need to know not in picture form but we need to know what type of person he was I want to know more about his life and his character because it's not the image that's light but the life was the light of men that's right if I if I actually see him in physical body form as we will when we meet him in the air it's too late then if I don't see him there and I'm waiting till he sets foot on Earth again and I haven't seen him then then it's too late then if I see him in body form before white Throne judg it's too late then that's right brother bam in the sermon Watchman what of the night speaking of Art and uh and and light and composition there's such a a a a great alignment there with this Watchman what of the night and I don't have this statement provided so I just try to read this quickly so we can uh make a little bit more progress what if man sit here with a long white robe on and hair hanging way down like this he might not have looked like that that's just what the artist painted a picture of he might look altogether different from that but what if he stood here and had nail prints in his hands Prince of scars in the forehead and sit here and said he was the Lord Jesus you know right quick I'd tell you he was wrong I think he says it kind of as a question when Jesus comes time shall be no more in that form in that kind of image it could not be the Lord Jesus but then if he's the same yesterday and T forever how could he be here in the form of the Holy Spirit where he Sanctified us to move into us and to perform his Works through us because that is his agents The Works that I do shall you do also now how would he declare himself then to know what was the same Jesus because he'd be able to do the same work that he did before he was crucified so now if an artist is known by his work and it's amazing how specialized people have become to where they could look at a painting and they could deduce by the work that that's not who the person is purporting the artist to be by the way that he worked so what was were his Works he says and that was you all ready you want to work the works of Christ The Works that I do shall you do also the work was he did what the father showed him he did what the father showed him Christ did what God told him to do those are the works that you've got to do I'm going to I'm going to keep plowing forward here in Ephesians 5:1 it says be therefore followers of God as dear children be therefore followers of God as dear children followers is that mes imitators be ye an imitator of God as dear children the act of intimidate intimidating well some of us are really have learned the art of that the act of imitating someone often stems from your admiration for it for that person this respect that you would have for somebody you you find out they like this and therefore you do the same thing this imitation as it were they say is imitation is the sincerest form of flattery a a cleric in the Church of England wrote that imitation is the sincerest of flattery it shows admiration and respect not not a uh satire not a parody but this is an imitation be therefore imitators of God as dear children that's why our children uh often times do the things that they do it's through the respect and admiration for you it's when they're not doing the things you do when maybe they're losing the respect but it's this sense of one who is a child who admires and looks up to somebody will then begin to replicate and imitate what they're seeing reflected Jesus said except you become as little children there's even something about every Artist as you begin to study them especially within the visual arts that there's something childlike about their imagination they've retained something in their innocence to where they're able to bring forth things in a creative way but as dear children not ones who are lacking Zoe life not ones who lack the skill to actually do it but be therefore imitators of God as his children as children of God imitate God as children of God therefore bring forth that image and expression of God let your life imitate him in this sense there is a truth that life imitates art that our lives ought to be this imit of God as his children that as he is a certain way as he makes himself known that's the way that I want to be as God desires a certain thing to be done as I see that as his son and you as his children as you see that you can begin to reflect it back out and it's not an impersonation through this imitation it's literally demonstration that's why you the the skill is there the life is there Jesus did what the father showed him and brother B says the harmony of the father and the son he says notice it Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride I just ask musicians to come I'm going to stop there I've been long enough I've got got halfway through but we'll stop there this harmony now exists between the groom and his bride so think if Christ is to be expressed in this hour if we were to be something beautiful that's come out of Christ this image this striking image then we'd want to know what he looks like the very word of God that he wrote in the Old Testament had came out in the flesh of Jesus Christ and once again this word of God which was written what God has been trying to say through the word has got to be seen in flesh think of that what God has been trying to say Through the Bible even to the message of the hour God wants that language to be transformed into flesh he wants it to be art how so that that that we would by that word our life would animate it that your life will animate the word this is where I wrestled with it when I God was originally dealing with me on these things that life imitates art well I don't know if I necessarily agree with the origin of that statement and I see the truth of it in a fallen society and I have a hard time maybe with the word imitate and and maybe it's life animates the word and and and twist it and contort it to where it fits maybe uh a more acceptable cliche that we might have as message Believers but the more that I looked at it says life the life was the light of men Therefore your life is the reflection of God's word amen you reflect the image of the Creator the life is the light of men without your life there is no Beauty to be seen without your life there's no Beauty to be seen anywhere that's right unless you shine light the only thing that can be seen is the worst of humanity but even when we let our shine there's things that can be seen and appreciated everywhere the more negative we are the more complaining we are the more D we are the more Unfaithful we are the more stubborn we are the less light there is in the world [Music] today it's his light shining on us in this hour the light of god good morning bride that will allow us to reflect the final Masterpiece the life your life is the light of men how else are they going to hear how else are they going to know I know that I'm being repetitious and I I thank you for your patience in it I thank you for your diligence through several these uh maybe several series or maybe the last four and a half years or whatever it's been I thank you for it even my own children are saying that was a good that good sermon Dad it's a lot of the same things it's good could it be that God is just laying a large and sturdy foundation for greater things I'm not trying to make an excuse for repetition but if if the same things are being emphasized over and over then God is paying very careful detail to this masterpiece he's paying attention not he's not going to gloss over anything for your sake I'm not trying to build a compendium or a library of sermon so that if if things would T in 200 years they would unearth uh the mp3s of this and be like who is this wise philosopher a Aon this guy right it's something else and and be so enamored with the composition a and the mannerisms and said this is a real this is a great body of work let us we need to uh we need to Archive this and make it available no no it's not about this art it's about the living thing it's about you who are beholding the beauty of the Lord who are seeing his image and are inspired once again to speak you're you're inspired uh to to live in a way that accurately reflects the heart of your Creator and I I wanted to and it just uh we have some things we'll get to on Wednesday night Lord will it but there's a variety that God's expressing in this room there's some religions that would have required for all of us to look a certain way this morning I don't mean holy or modest I mean wearing white pants white shirt a certain dress code the same in the ministry will all the ministry wears the same outfit right there's a certain way that they try to create this homogenization overall and remove all distinctions and differences and varieties for appearance sake supposing that that's godliness wanting to say that this is sacred this represents and and lifts up what is sacred and what is Holy but the reality is the greatest beauty that God has ever expressed was when deity was in the profane I'm not saying something perverted but I mean something common something normal when there was no sacredness and Holiness and Grandeur and beauty that we'd like oh my goodness do you see that but in a composition in a light in a frame and in a form that was every day that was different across the board that one could look one way one could look another one could enjoy one thing one can enjoy another through their different taste and their different passions and desires they [Music] harmonize and they represent the God who is a god of variety and they're able to be a chorus they're able to be a composition that I Pray by God's grace I pray that you all become whether individually or collectively as a group where however you may uh gather together and represent yourself through normal light I pray that your light would be shining for others to see and come to know the Christ that's being revealed in you let's stand and pray thank you for your patience even today thank you I I was long for the visitors I normally preach 42 minutes on the dot right is that about right maybe not try to be about an hour usually though I think I've been much longer but thank you for your patience today a lot of things to consider how does God want your life to represent his character amen so that you're not telling beautiful untrue things amen our gracious heavenly father today Lord as we close this service in prayer we do as we often do we ask that you'd Bless the people that have been here who have heard your word who've battled through complexes and fears and overcome insecurities maybe overcome a difficult morning a lack of rest whatever it might be Lord I never trivialize one's presence in your house some may say oh well they haven't been here in over a month but they're here amen and that pleases the Lord Lord we don't know what others have gone through we don't know what people are going through but Lord I believe that you've begun a good work and though right now from our vantage point it may seem to be a composition that's very chaotic may not be painting much of a beautiful picture but I say Lord let your light shine let it shine Lord that we might see the work that you're doing in their lives and glorify you Lord help us to be these accurate portrayals of who you are Lord as we were reading through those last statements Brother bradam begin to point out that there could be an artist's rendering of who you are and what you look like they could paint Jesus Christ and have a a particular image and he says but we want to know we'd have to know what kind of person you were not just what you look like and Lord just as rbrand painted those beautiful self-portraits I believe you the Creator is painting another Masterpiece sculpting it fashioning it by Your Word by your tender hand so that we can be not so much in in a homogeneous physical form all the men have shaved heads and no beards and khaki pants and two button polo shirt we all wear the same shoes and we all do the same things we all like the same things and eat the same food and all the sisters dress the same way and make the same foods and we just homogenize into some forced Unity Lord if we want that we should just join the World Council of churches the more we mix the more we mingle the more we borrow the more we fuse the more steampunk we get the more we all look alike to now the hipsters aren't different anymore Lord I pray that you could help us to be true to what you are painting bless us Lord I know I'm repeating myself over and over again but I pray that what you're doing is you're solidifying a foundation for great things I believe for our church for our families and for the individuals who Fellowship here you have great things in store for them bless us I pray as we commit all things to you and asking your blessing upon the people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord God bless you Lord will will just pick up on these things we may we may just pick up on this next Sunday um if that's me if that's just how it might work out better just for those who come and are here we have a tremendously uh faithful and uh uh group that comes on Wednesday nights and those who aren't able to make it we uh we pray for you that you would be able to and those who don't even want to come at all we pray for you that you'll want to uh because I think our midweek service is a very special time very special Gathering it's usually just a really faithful core that's always here and so sometimes uh I don't like to necessarily finish a Sunday morning on a Wednesday night for the benefit of those who will be here next Sunday we might just finish some of these things but think about it how is God being imitated through me not God becoming a character of you but you becoming an imitator a rep a a not so much of a replication but a reflection of a genuine true life so that your life imitates God accurately God bless you you are dismissed as those who like to stay in worship you could do that at this
