TRANSCRIPT
========================================
luke chapter 17 read verses 26 to 30 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and in reading this we're trying to pick up on some things that we're speaking on sunday morning but it's it's identifying very clearly that you're going to have days that are like the days of noah and days that are like the days of lot but this is the these are circumstances of the age when it says in the days of the son of man so there's something the son of man is going to be present or something where he's making himself known as it says even thus shall it be when the son of man is revealed but all these other circumstances are going to exist in that time when the son of man is making himself known in his day and it's a very remarkable uh way that christ pieces these things together and so my title this evening is revelation resolves complication and uh and and wanting to focus now on this revealing of the son of man so you can be seated and in doing that just maybe making reference to uh what we believe christ is doing and how he's making himself very real to us and i appreciate the song that sister rebecca sang and and i i wish i maybe could just have the words i think i could just preach from verse course verse chorus on just how directed those words were to how the holy spirit's been speaking to our hearts as a church and dealing with our hearts i thought it was just very beautiful so maybe even those words that were expressed from a daughter of god's heart can form a little bit of a foundation for the things that we want to speak on i don't want to spend a lot of time going back into some of the background of the other five services that we spoke on this subject but we can all agree that we're living in a very complicated world and we are trying to make sense of this complicated world with complicated minds and sometimes that's why it makes sense it's because it's a complicated world and our complicated minds kind of trick us into thinking oh it all makes sense this is i see it perfectly clear and then we come to find out we don't actually see it the right way but in revelations chapter 3 verse 17 i want to begin there because this is describing the world that we live in we could call it the age that we live in the laodicean age it describes society as a whole it's describing the climate the political atmosphere the social atmosphere it's the climate that we live in and i it would i would be remiss not to point out that this very directly and specifically describes the spiritual climate and the attitude of nominal churches and those who just generally claim to believe in jesus christ so we know that it has its most perfect application to the spiritual world but it being descriptive of the spiritual world it's indicative of the world at large and what the world at large is going through in the environment that it's in and even through these last several months that we've been fellowshipping together and the lord has began this church there's been a lot of focus on the first few chapters of genesis and we're often coming back to these very verses in revelations chapter 3 because it perfectly describes the worldly climate that we're living in and i believe that god wants us to fully understand the day and time that we're living in and so this is god's diagnosis and his description of the age that we live in because thou sayest or this is his um his disclosing what the age thinks about itself because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now this is the preface to verse 18 but we so we can put it this way you say that you're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and you don't know that you're actually wretched miserable poor blind and naked and what a pitiful situation to be in to think that you're well clothed and you're well uh um amended and you have all these things and you're rich and increased with goods but in reality you're actually destitute you're poor you're naked and you're blind and that's a very horrible situation to be in because even if there was something that could remedy your lacking you're not aware of it so you don't seek it so it's a very terrible situation to be in and brother branham described the burden of this age as a pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions he said in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in so there's a pressure of riches there's soft living and nervous tensions these things relate even to how they say i'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing it's related to those pressure of riches the deceitfulness of riches soft living and nervous tensions we looked at luke chapter eight last wednesday night how that the the word of god is sewn into good ground but yet cares of this life riches and the pleasures of this life choke out the word so that it's not coming to its perfection and that should be a comfort to us that jesus uses this parable to show that there's nothing wrong with the word and there's actually nothing wrong with your elected ground in this perfect ground which your heart is there's just other things that are sewn in by by nature and even by nurture and the things we experience and the things that we say and that we do that become thorns and thistles and briars within our garden and within our hearts that compete with the word and there's nothing wrong with the word but there's cares there's riches and the pleasures of this life that compete against the the word of god and the things that nurture the word of god and so it's a comfort to us to realize that god has ordained us to be a fruitful bowel to bring forth perfect fruit and that the word of god are zeroing in on those things that choke out the expression of the word and and if that's true then we just say lord you're the husband and you're the you're the one that keeps this vineyard so we just yield ourselves to you to take these thorns these thistles anything that's competing with the true word of god and that grain that's inside of me by election lord i give you full permission every door come in and do your part i yield to that part that it might bring forth your word in perfection and so this is this is a description of society it's blindly groping it thinks it has a lot it thinks it's great it thinks it's doing wonderful and we amplified it quite a bit last time but they actually lack the knowledge of what is best they think they got it all figured out but they actually lack the knowledge of what is necessary for true happiness and there's a channel that we could go down where we could use a lot of societal studies and things that refer to academia how in general human nature is often dissatisfied with the things that it thinks will bring them the most happiness and you could take even statements and say i'm the happiest i've ever been i have no regrets in life and then say i'm the most miserable person and i find that life isn't worth living and try to guess you know match match who said it and you could have the person who is a paraplegic by virtue of an accident at the age of 26 versus a person who won a 50 million dollar lottery and you'd say well the lottery winner is the one that's happy and has no regrets and you find no he's the one that hates life and wish he wasn't living and it's the paraplegic that actually says you know what i'm happy i have no regrets and it kind of fools us as humans because we think that doesn't make any sense that's irrational and that is the status of of the minds of people in the climate that people are living in they they don't really know what brings true happiness humans are in unpredictable and irrational and we mentioned the statement by democrities and this sets a record for the number of times that he's been mentioned in a message church but he says the cause of sinning is ignorance of what is better and so the the reason why man sins and the reason why we even make mistakes is in the moment that we're doing what we're doing uh and we're doing something that's not displeasing to the lord we've let go and we're no longer conscious of what the better thing to do is we're not ruled by that we're not governed by that so there's a letting go of what is better and as we even were uh using the phrase on sunday morning simplicity by faith that's that's what it means to when we say go going back to the beginning it's finding simplicity by faith coming back to that source so that real thing that's going to be give true meaning and give a context to all of our actions and give us something to live live for so we're even focusing again on the simplicity by faith because the reason why mankind makes mistakes is they lack revelation they they lack real guidance from the lord they're not tethered to his leadership and submitted to it and brother branham wrote about the laodicean age he says it cries it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire and i'm wanting to come to a place that i was last wednesday and i had to skip it in uh and finish and kind of go into a different direction and i wanted to come back to some principles that we wanted to share that time so some of this is review but brother i'm saying that they brag that they have everything a great amplitude of all things things that ought to be bringing them happiness but yet possessing all things they're still desiring to uncover more even though they say we have everything we need they're and we don't need anything else their actions betrayed their how they really feel in the heart because they're constantly searching constantly trying to find more is that one man said man is a perpetually wanting animal he's always hungry it's always insatiable he's never satisfied as even solomon said the eye is never satisfied with seeing and the ears never satisfied with hearing we always want want want want want it's never enough and so this is all connected back to the fall of mankind in the fall as we made the remark on sunday it's still uh deeply rooted in in all of our wanderings the the what when mankind fell it's resonated within humanity it's been bred into humanity even by the disobedience of cain and and how the generations unfold all of our conclu uh confusions and our perplexities can all go back to the fall and even the disobedience of cain who knowing that god had a better way still resisted it because god just said if thou do as well will that not be accepted and he could have said well lord what is that right way what is the what is the better way what was it about my brother's sacrifice that was pleasing to you and god said he offered a sacrifice by faith he offered a sacrifice by revelation and it would not have been an offense to god to say god give me revelation lord give me faith and and even as the bible says if a man lacks wisdom let him ask and god is happy to give wisdom so there's certain things that god has uh available for us that we can use we just need to ask and the sin of cain was in knowing that there was a better way maybe not knowing what that way was but being apprised by the voice of god that there was a better way he didn't humble himself to seek it and say lord i want it what is that way that i can walk in it so we're looking at the end of the beginning and those things that's put this feeling in this backslidden condition into mankind that we're seeing come to perfection now and as we were reading before mankind has put himself in the position that he's in genesis chapter 6 says the man has done this to himself he's become the architect or the mastermind of his own confusion and his own chaos by not holding to and letting go of what is necessary because mankind is no longer retaining god in his knowledge because he's not conscious of the divine in letting go of that he's no longer connected to what is necessary and when man left the one thing that is necessary then man is only left he's left to everything else to influence him to guide him to push him to drive him and that'll never satisfy him and the one thing necessary we said it's faith in god believing in his word looking to the promise and knowing the promise of the time that you're living in in the days of noah it would have been believing god it would have been walking faithfully according to his word and believing that it was going to rain but there was an ark of safety in the days of moses it would have been uh having faith in god believing his word and then also knowing that despite your situation as a slave in egypt that god had promised to deliver and then recognizing god bringing his promised word to pass when the deliverers on the scene those would be the things that would have been necessary in those times of those believers we've referenced this statement a couple times and i want to read it to you tonight recognizing your day and its message and brother branham just prior to this he says mankind has the same senses he had 6 000 years ago and he says it this way six thousand years ago with the senses he had he contacted his earthly home and served god so man six thousand years ago is made up just the same way that mankind is today the average height may have changed in certain physical characteristics have changed certain things about our uh specific ways in our mind and and the things that were uh the nurture that's being sewn into us or the nature that's being sewn into us the nurture that develops uh that nature has definitely evolved over several thousand years but think of it just mankind its basic elements has always had five senses of the body five senses of the flesh and he says he had these senses and these abilities six thousand years ago and when he had it he contacted the earth and he made his way through the earth but he served god that's where you see the seed of seth the sons of adam the sons of god called upon god they sought god but then he says now in the past 75 years that man has come from a horse and buggy to an astronaut and it is a very remarkable uh acceleration of inventions and economies and in industry says he's gone all the way from a horse and buggy to an astronaut he was at once at one time propelled by natural force uh with a will and horsepower but now they've been able to harness energy and propel a man in a rocket ship to the moon it may be hard for us to fathom just how separate and disparate those two powers are but brother brahms identified that in just a short period of time in less than a hundred years mankind has accelerated his advancement accelerated his inventions and accelerated his development and and even breaking the law of how technology will increase and and amplify and grow he says why he turned away from his faith in god and turned it over to his senses and his ability as a human being now this might seem like a compliment right that when as soon as man let go of his faith in god he's now able to accomplish great advancements in science and technology and inventions and travel from the earth to the to the moon and even make in a way that perhaps one day if we destroyed this planet maybe we could set up another colony on another and say this is man and his inventions and his devices is always seeking a way to rescue himself and and this is to the good of mankind but it's actually not a compliment he's saying the further you get away from god the more entrenched you get into your own thinking and it unlocks a lot of potential that mankind has even in genesis chapter 11 god even said man is one they're united in their thought and being united in their thought and in their language being united in purpose there's nothing they can't accomplish so god had to confound their language to break up their unity this speaks to really the innate power within man who can be united who can draw from his senses draw from his ingenuity draw from his intellect and his intelligence and do a lot of awesome powerful wonderful things in the name of science and knowledge but this is not a compliment to man they were only able to do this when they were no longer relying upon god and no longer relying upon god they had to rely upon themselves he says did you notice it he quit trusting god he trusts himself so man has been able to accomplish the things that he has because he's not trusting in god anymore and and if you ponder that and begin to try to think about it in a very deep way that when you're trusting god for something he can make provision and there's ways that he can accomplish things that brings you contentment and meets the needs that you have in your life but once you begin to leave that you have to devise your own ways to meet the necessities but then also quiet the emptiness you have so you have to seek luxuries and you'll find that even at the turn of the century there was languages being introduced at the turn of the 20th century at the end of the 1800s of conspicuous spending and things that mankind was buying things that really didn't relate to necessities but they wanted to have things that related to status that you could identify this person was a person of means and of wealth and this began to overcome all of society and it became an insatiable desire why because man left his contentment in christ he let go of his faith in god and trusting him and being satisfied in him he quit trusting god he trust in himself and so the way back to simplicity is by faith and brother man said faith is a revelation of the will of god faith is a revelation of the will of god if you have faith in other words you have a revelation that you're in the will of god that's going to bring a stability even when everything's going crazy and everything's upset nothing seems to be working out that's going to bring a stability that's going to bring a resolve and a connection and a and a connection to the divine such that you're not just uh worried about all the other things that are chaotic around you say god made me a promise he gave me he showed me his will i know him i'm in god's will and you can rest in that and you could be very focused to that now in luke chapter 17 verses 26 to 29 let us since we already read it as our text and as you take a look at it there on the overhead we could see that there's going to be a day when the son of man is revealed and he's likening the characteristics of that time when he is revealed to the circumstances as it was in the days of noah and when christ identifies the attitude of the people and the actions of the people in the days of noah he does not say the imagination of man was only evil continually he does not say that man has corrupted himself he does not say that all man has all flesh they become flesh but he says they're eating drinking married wives and given into marriage and so it's describing mankind in terms that we can all relate to then when it refers to the days of lot wherein they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but jesus is identifying routine ordinary normal activities that all of us do and these are the things that he uses in his language to raise up the days of sodom and gomorrah now prophet comes and he's very direct and he points out that the circumstances of the days of lot and the circumstances of the days of of noah carried with it other other characteristics and other manifestations that perfectly fit the time that we're living in now absolutely prophetically fit the time that we're living in now and there's something that jesus is identifying that brought about that evil that brings about that perversion and this way of life of this eating drinking marrying eating drinking buying selling planting buildings speaks of a consumption-based lifestyle to their only living to satisfy the flesh and that was the only way of life there wasn't even a pursuit of god in the things of god and as we mentioned on sunday the evil jesus doesn't mention the evil because it's it's in what would they lack their faith in god they clearly do not have faith in god this is what's not undergirding they're eating and they're drinking they're not turning things whenever and giving thanks whenever they eat they're not believing that the provision that they have is from the hand of the lord when they're married they're not seeking the will of god and what would be pleasing to him these the will of god faith all these things that should be at the very heart of a believer's attitude and action is missing in the people in the days of noah and in the days of life and he's speaking to faith because in luke chapter 18 which is a continuation of this conversation that he's having with his disciples about and even as he's the pharisees are demanding of him certain things and then he speaks unto them a parable he gives the parable of the unjust judge and at the conclusion of that parable his his point is i tell you that as the unjust judge delivered this widow that was psycho dialing him or constantly texting him or whatever it is we want to use to describe this woman who is constantly wearing this unjust judge he says if the unjust judge would deliver this widow woman how much more will your heavenly father deliver the elect to cry unto him and want deliverance in the end time and he says i tell you that he will avenge them speedily he says nevertheless when the son of man cometh because the revealing of the son of man is the coming of the son of man he says shall he find faith on earth now i absolutely believe in all my heart it's a rhetorical question because he has found the faith he's the the he is the author of the faith he's the one that stirs up the faith he's the one that brings the faith it's his coming that actually instigates the faith but it's faith that was missing in the days of noah and the days of lord and it's the faith that we must have to begin to look to god's promises and in looking to those promises have the faith that the son of man is joined to to bring about the vengeance and the deliverance in this end time and even that even in that very vein and that very thought uh when you when you come to the word of god and you begin to feed on the message of the hour and i know it seems very strange in certain circles and certain ways that it can be described and it can be foreign in a lot of ways but you you believers know how just personal it is and how real it's been made known to you you had a faith in the word of god you begin to uh listen to the word of god you're feeding on the the preaching of the word and you're you're you're reading the books and you're listening to the messages and you're hearing about a faith and you're in you're believing in certain promises and you begin to even look forward to certain prophecies that are being expressed in scripture and through the word of god and what is it doing it's bringing about a faith and then things that you actually hoped and believed for you find as you stay in the word of god get quick and do and you realize it's not coming it's here some things that i was looking forward to things that i was longing for things that i was praying lord wouldn't it be wonderful these things be fulfilled and so the word of god it creates a faith and then as the word creates this faith it's that very faith that the son of man can come to and make himself known to it's very beautiful how this this word of god unfolds and and how important faith is so as these things this this uh way of life of just satisfying the flesh and and this consumption lifestyle just to have and to eat and to drink and to build and to plant and to sell and and all these different transactions it says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed this to me the way the way i want it to strike you is the way that i i believe that jesus means this to this is a way that jesus means for this to be taken into your hearts the revelation of the son of man is the answer to the condition of the age what was the answer to the unjust widow the ju excuse me the just widow crying to the unjust judge the unjust finally doing something to avenge her what's going to be the answer to the cries of the of the desperate believers hearts it's going to be the son of man coming to their defense and to their aid so jesus is saying that in the midst of days that are like the days of noah in the midst of days that are like the days of law our answer to those conditions and those circumstances will be the revelation of the son of man don't try to figure it out without it don't try to navigate it without it he's saying the revelation of the son of man is actually god's answer it's his response to the condition of the age and so christ revealing himself is man's rescue it's your rescue it's the believer's rescue from the chaos the confusion the rescue and deliverance from the complications because who is this one jesus says in john 14 6 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me i am the way the truth and the life this is who christ is he is the word he is the way and if you don't have a way you can't go so there's no going without christ he is the truth without truth there is no knowledge there is no knowing so through christ there is a going through christ there is a knowing and without life there is no living jesus christ is the way the truth the life he is your going he is your knowing he is your living he is your all in all even notice how that theme keeps coming up in the songs that are sung with different song leaders and different ones singing specials there's something about him being your all in all and giving yourself over completely to him i am the way the truth and the life brother branham says in the message broken cisterns he says for he is the only way to the truth to the life and to eternal joy and eternal peace he is the only one and the only way to that the inexhaustible fountain of life is jesus christ why and who is he the word the same the word the life the fountain the same yesterday today and forever and this is the part that really struck my heart the true believer it's his supreme joy his supreme life his supreme satisfaction is in christ anybody ever heard of the brand supreme if if you find a supreme sweatshirt at goodwill you buy it even if it's a fake i mean it could be worth a lot more than what you paid for it at goodwill it's amazing just how much value people have attached to this brand supreme and just how many knockoffs there are i don't own any supreme if i came across a really good deal i might one day if i could get a supreme tie who knows but this is the believer's supreme right here this has more value than any any hat any sweatshirt any shoes any belt anything that the supreme brand can come up with this is the trouble it's his supreme joy his supreme life and his supreme satisfaction is in christ and there's well let me say this if we're not careful we can get to a certain place as believers that if you're not talking about threes and sevens and and the bright age and seven seals and seven thunders in typing all those things out through numbers and if it's it's not always in that channel we we get in our minds well that's not really this is what i'm focused on this is what i want this is what i think is great but if all those things don't produce supreme joy supreme life and supreme satisfaction you don't know those things and let's not take these thoughts of peace and joy and comfort in the fruits of the spirit and say well that's the pentecost message and that's the baptist message and if i want that i can go down the street to the bible church the community church and get that kind of teaching listen everything that's in the word of god is yours and christ who is making himself known to you today does not just want to fill your head up with knowledge of types and fulfillments and histories he wants you to have supreme joy supreme life and supreme satisfaction and as coming through the word of god so let's not forsake these other parts because if we if we just kind of forsake well that's simple that's just baptist and that and you know that's just this or that or whatever however you would disparage it you're actually not realizing that all the deep things and all the great things and the wonderful things god has done in this hour is to produce all these other things and if it's not to produce it it rests upon that very foundation so that it can come to you and he says notice how this just continues to pull out come forth supreme joy supreme life supreme satisfaction is in christ no pumping no pulling no joining no bailing just believing in resting we should just make that a bumper sticker be really hard to understand what do they mean by this but no pumping no pulling no joining no bailing just believing and resting it just describes the struggle of life trying to pump things up trying to pull for this joining that bailing that there's all different ways that we try to find settledness and find peace and try to find our place in this world and get ahead or or get out while we can or get in before it it goes up too high all these different things we try to worry ourselves about but he says in christ you're just believing and resting you don't have to worry about the pumping pulling joining and bailing he says you're just believing and resting that is what he is to the believing to the believing he's rest it's not trying to work it up it's not trying to pull or join or bail to the believer he's rest what are we taught that the stimulation of revelation is what satisfaction to the believer revelation is the stimulation of joy it's the stimulation of satisfaction now if you can begin to recognize that there's a way that the flesh wants to be appeased and to be satisfied and sensitized but then there's a way that faith is satisfied and if you can begin to look in your life and realize the times in my life when faith was really resting and satisfied those were my greatest moments of joy in the times when my flesh was sensitized and thought it was being satisfied those are my greatest moments of disappointment you can begin to measure yourself to say lord i want to be sure that i have satisfied faith not just a satisfied flesh we could structure this church in such a way to where all of you get a really satisfied in your flesh when you attend church there's a way that you can do it you can make sure that it's a particular time don't say a man too loudly you can make sure that this the song service is done a certain way and there's ways that we could arrange the song service just by the study of human nature and all the things that they do to recommend how you can have dynamic church services and engage your audience and keep them coming back for more and you'll find that those things that just satisfy the flesh are not long-lasting those things always have to change there's always got to be a new a new look there's got to always be something that's refreshed and keep the people interested and keep them coming and always do certain cuts and different changes to keep the mind engaged but we do not come with the sitcom attitude we do not come with the the the attention span as we would as we sit before a full feature film or some kind of tv show we come knowing that it's faith that's being fed and if that takes place over an hour if that takes place over a longer duration we have this mindset where our body is being brought subject to this faith that says i need this this is beneficial and that church is not geared to the flesh church is geared to the faith that can overcome the flesh that if we just pump you up in the flesh then we always got to pump you up in the flesh and we'll always be bailing you out in the flesh always trying to figure out ways that we can pump and pull and join and bail but if faith can be fed then that's the very thing that spills out into your flesh and into your work your life as as believers and in whatever walk of life you have and that's what makes a difference jesus christ is a stimulation of satisfaction to the believer now i'm going to read some very familiar statements to you about revelation and i'm wanting you to think about them just a little bit differently than maybe you would before because when we say revelation we think revelation the seventh thunders we say revelation we think about the revelation of the seven seals and when we say revelation we are we can appropriately think about that and we can think about this revelation that is brought as it relates to very significant outstanding scriptures in the word of god but this this the mechanics of revelation and the very practical impact of the revelation of the seals the revelation of those seven thunders it speaks to something that is pervasive that when we catch a revelation of the word of god what changes is not just our knowledge but our life that's the very thing about revelation is it's something that just it shakes through it reverberates through your entire person you educate something that someone that they're not supposed to do something and that can be held to as a discipline for a certain period of time but you catch the revelation that's something that becomes permanent that's something that if you fail in that regard you have something to rescue you from it get you back on track look to the promise and get you out of it you i believe that by revelation you could take the mantra that once an addict always an addict by revelation you can break that i was an addict i'm not an addict anymore but now i live i live by a different life i live by a different instinct and that's why so i want you to think about revelation uh i don't want to i want you to i don't want you to change the way you think about it but i want you to just kind of capture in a greater a greater view and a more broad view of how revelation is applicable and in revelation of jesus christ which is the chap of chapter one of the church age book not when he preaches the church ages but when he writes the book the church age book the seven church ages he says the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized and and i just take it that way that means if you were to preach every second of every service for the next 40 years emphasizing the importance of true revelation by the spirit to a true believer you will not have overemphasized it and that that should give great await to the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer and it says revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize and this is where i kind of want it to broaden a little bit revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now we understand maybe a lot of us understand just how important it is to have a revelation of the promise for your day and a revelation of certain scriptures that are being fulfilled and a revelation of the fulfillment of revelations 10 1-7 a revelation of first thessalonians 4 16 a revelation of malachi 4 5 a revelation of luke 17 30 but even that revelation may be more important than you realize and and that may it may mean more to you than you realize he says in the very next page of that of the church age book that we're reading from but when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her now that definitely takes um the magnitude of revelation and exponentially increases its largeness that if i can get a revelation uh believe the spirit's revelation of the word and disbelieve satan's teaching or to satan's lie then the gates of hell are ineffective against me so we want to put ourselves in this position realizing that in the end as we live in the end at the end of satan's eden his tactics have never changed and so in the beginning as he tempted eve he that were those were the gates of hell coming against the woman to cause her faith to fall to open herself up to be uh for her uh her her knowledge to be defiled and therefore gaining access to her knowledge she then acted upon that knowledge we're going to be facing the same temptation in the end we're going to come and contact it again by every word we're going to be facing this temptation so the temptation in the beginning is the same temptation in the end and the anecdote the answer what's going to resolve that temptation is revelation as complicated as your challenges may be and as complicated as the situations you are in it may seem to you revelation is what can make sense of all of it and jesus says that revelation means brother brown says revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize and as jesus said that the gates of hell cannot prevail against the revelation of jesus christ i want you to understand even his sister rebecca i'm assuming you wrote that song did you write that song wonderful that that very thought of that of that song is in christ in the revelation of jesus christ perhaps it means more to you than you realize because the gates of hell in whatever weapon they try to form against you and whatever path it takes and whatever angle in whatever circumstance you're in you can believe that the revelation of jesus christ is greater than anything that's coming against you and and because it's a revelation of the word it's a revelation you say a physical need yes it's the revelation of the god who created the human body if it's if it's a financial decision it's a revelation of the god who's given the best teachings on finances in this book there's so many things that you could find that whatever the need is revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize because a revelation of this by the spirit of the word of god can make the gates of hell and all the tactics of the enemy ineffective against you brother branham wright said this is a couple pages later in chapter 1 of the church edge book it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil in any circumstance revelation revelation is the only thing revelation is everything brother said everything is revelation you say everything is revelation yes everything is a revelation the new birth is a revelation the rapture is a revelation your way from the new birth to the rapture it's revelation it's all revelation it's all contained in this revealing of the word of god and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it is that simple it is that simple the revelation of god will give you authority over the devil in every circumstance in every situation it will give you authority over your flesh gives you authority over the world you by revelation can have authority over sin the world the flesh and the devil don't sell yourself short revelation of the word of god gives you authority over those things he says it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word so the importance of it to you can never be overemphasized it means more to you than perhaps you realize because the revelation of god gives you authority over the devil if you believe the spirit's revelation of the word and deny satan's lie about the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against you so he says there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word so nothing has more prevailing power than a revelation of the word of god so this is this is i don't even know which way that i could express it uh to make the point but i was watching some kids open some pokemon cards the other day and they're saying this one's the best nothing can defeat this this is undefeatable well to use a pokemon card analogy this is there's nothing more powerful than the revelation of the word of god there's nothing that can defeat that there's nothing that can overcome that you you can't combine anything together there's nothing that can match you you say well that's powerful that's power oh that's really good that's great no this is good but this is something that cannot be defeated it can't even be matched there's no draw you can't play you can't play that hand this is i'm standing on the revelation of the word of god and satan said well it's a draw this isn't like tic-tac-toe where if you really know what you're doing no one ever wins right this is something that it's a move that satan can't match nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word now i want to i'm going to take a step further in this and and i want to use just some summary language when we speak of revelation and in the in the if you just look at these few statements we've read from and the way that we're trying to emphasize it and how the revelation of the son of man is the answer to the chaotic world and this complicated age that we live in revelation then we achieve this simplicity by revelation and revelation is simplicity through divine discernment through knowledge wisdom and understanding so i want to use revelation this revelation of him that brings wisdom that brings knowledge that brings understanding that brings discernment because we need these things in our lives we need that we need discernment and knowledge wisdom and understanding we need these uh in our lives we need these to be a part of our nature and we need them growing we need them developing we want to have more wisdom we if if we come to the lord and we have discernment out of two on a scale of one one to ten then 20 years later you don't want to still be at a two right if wisdom and knowledge are it could be scalable in that sense we want it to be increasing we want it to be growing we want to become sharper and more more wise and more understand and have more knowledge as it pertains to revelation and the things of god now the to to look at the age that we're living in very very quickly satan when he attacked eve he used a question and a lie and gave her knowledge contrary to truth and even if you could somehow frame what the devil said and say that it was factual if facts lead you to a conclusion that's contrary to the word then those facts aren't truth and we live in a post true society and this post-modernism takes facts and elevates them above truth and says that truth is subjective and that whatever your truth is is different than my truth whatever your truth is is different than your truth and we can all have our own subjective individual truths but yet facts are objective and that everyone has to agree to the facts because facts uh what is it the famous saying facts don't care about your feelings well okay but i know one thing's for sure truth truth is truth no matter what and fact can be used to draw a conclusion that's contrary to truth and we should never let facts be elevated above truth there can be it doesn't mean we have to deny facts if they could scientifically prove without any shadow of doubt without any change in their theory without even evolving and manipulating and reversing course could say no we've definitively concluded that the world is 6.3 billion years old and that was an established fact and everyone in the world could prove it and say it and it was immutable and it was agreeable that fact that the world is so many billions of years old cannot lead you to a conclusion that's contrary to truth or contrary to the word we would use the truth to place those facts in a way that makes sense well if that is true then how do we arrive at this conclusion that in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth how do we arrive at that then we have the word that tells us period could god create a rock right now that was 6 billion years old i'm not trying to sound like an apologist but i'm just saying my god is able to create out of nothing a rock that when scientifically tested aged 6 billion years old why god that's why he just can with man this is impossible to take no substance and bring substance but the whole point is i'm not going to let scientific fact and the result of scientific inquiry in the scientific process and this rigorous rigor rigorous method of testing and hypothesizing and coming up with a theory and they very rarely ever get to fact but i'm not going to let hypotheses and theories and facts that seem to assail truth i'm not going to let them intimidate me and say i know what truth is and i will let god if possible resolve facts with the truth but i cannot let facts tear down the validity and the strength and the power of the revealed word of god and i know that that has very specific uh emphasis there uh because none of us we don't have the authority to just create revelation and say this is what i'm standing on to oppose truth as it pertains to the word of god and things that we know to be true because it's revelation by the spirit to the true believer not just inspirations by some spirit to a professed believer we're talking about true revelation where you're standing on solid ground and so the age that we're living in this post-truth society where truth is has lost its real meaning and its purpose we're living in what is called the information information age and i made quick reference to this last wednesday now it's also called the computer age or the digital age and this expresses this shift from industrialization to computerization and technology that's uh computing power and to data so we've shifted from a society that's dominated by industry and factories and plants to a an age which is characterized by computers and technology and the interconnectedness of networks and if you just looked at it historically there was a revolution that brought about the industrial age do you know what a revolution brought about the industrial age the industrial revolution and what was that when people left more of an agrarian farming type community and way of life and way of making a living in production and entered into more of an industrial production model and more of an industry-based uh uh economy and that brought about and then characterized the entire age and so it's a digital revolution that leads to the information age there's been a revolution there's been something turning something changing and these prior revolutions as we've already looked into the word of god and seen what the brother brethren had to say about they've resulted in these revolutions were revolt against god's word in order for a man to leave one age in one society one way of living and to go into the age of industry and have an industrial revolution and then bring about an industrial age it was a it was the side effect of him leaving his faith in god and giving himself over to his senses so these revolutions have actually in some way been connected to a revolt against god's word and a letting go of faith and so this data revolution that has overcome society and characterizes this laodicean age it's led us now as that we've had more information and more information and more connectedness we weren't merely satisfied anymore being connected and exchanging information this digital revolution which brought us to the information age has now led us to the age of experience it's an age where it's not just enough to have things that we're connected to and to share information and to read information now we want this connectedness to cause us to experience what we're what we're what we're reading what we're seeing and i feel like all of a sudden i've just i've stumbled into uh you know vintage book club where we're still stuck in the 50s you have no idea what i'm talking about and that could just be my poor way of expressing myself but let me let me slow down a little bit at the sake of going too too long tonight you take the information we've been getting we weren't satisfied with information now we want to experience that information so now it's just not enough to watch something it evolved to where now you want to have you want to have surround sound and it wasn't enough just to have surround sound now you want to be able to immerse yourself in it and now technology is becoming immersive now the data and the information that you have it needs to have a certain way of feedback and way of sensitizing the body because we've left just an age of gathering information and accumulating knowledge and we've entered into an age of experience so it's very important for us to realize that we're not passively sharing information anymore and that the sharing of information and the digestion of information is not going to end with just sharing it and not going to end with just reading it but we're now no longer sharing passively information but now we're actively showing our experiences it's not enough just to send a text message it's not enough just to communicate through direct messages now the apps that have the most uh the most effect upon the people and whether it be snapchat or tick tock and i haven't downloaded any of those apps but just what the way they're they're focused and the way they're centric is they open with the camera not with the text field why because we've moved from sharing information we've moved from wanting to exchange ideas and have information and we've allowed that information in this habit of sharing information and sharing things about ourselves it's gotten to the place where now it must be visual and it must be experienced i just don't want to text you and tell you that i'm that i'm doing something i want to show you by way of a video show you by way of pictures show you by some way of immersing yourself into what i'm doing and that's the way that information has now led to more of a desire to experience and to feel what other people are feeling and experiencing and so as i think i've read it somewhere where it says the age of telling is over it's now the age of showing if it was show and tell now it's showing and this was exactly satan's method in the beginning the way that he operated in the beginning is he gave eve knowledge and as soon as he gave her knowledge it wasn't enough to merely have that knowledge she had to act upon that knowledge and experience it and it's even the the flow of the way things have happened in the society going from an industrial society to a computerized society an information age a data age we've been flooded with information but we are not satisfied with knowing we want to experience that's why that's that's how marketing is set up that's how certain things get in our minds and get in our in our hearts if you never knew about something you wouldn't get the hankering for it right but what does society want to do it wants to expose you to it and give you enough information about it so something can begin to work in your conscious and it's not good enough to know about the movie and what the plot is and even how it resolves itself you want to immerse yourself in it you want to experience it you want to watch it you want to feel you want to become a part of it and it's not enough just to watch it anymore people want to dress up and act like it why because it becomes a way of life it becomes very very immersive and so in in in eden in god's eden satan created a lust for knowledge in the woman and then once that lust for knowledge came in her therefore there was a lust for experience and if you could if you could ponder that very very deeply and realize that satan's method of operation is to first make you knowledgeable about it or make you aware of it and then use knowledge to then entice you to experience it and use that as a template over any any temptation any experience that something's trying to draw me into into something i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna skip again and so let me just try to find me find find me find a place here to to stop we're living in this but abandon called the eden god's economy of innocence now we're no longer living in an economy of innocence to use the very phrase economy it means there's some sort of commerce some sort of transacting and we're living in a layout to see an economy where there's the commerce of knowledge leading to experience leading to having leading to possessing leading to owning and enjoying and and and i am emphasizing this just with a force and a weight behind me it's the knowledge that there's something else that makes us unhappy with what we have right that if if we all owned uh motorola flip phones and that's all that we had then we would all be happy with our motorola flip phones and and the only way that we could distinguish ourselves and have some sort of competition is because i have a leather looking cover over my uh motorola flip phone and you go that's really nice brother aaron but that's genuine leather mine is actually full lambskin leather feel this feel how soft it is and like oh i got to get me one of those but as long as there's nothing else we just kind of are happy to stay within that paradigm but knowledge is what begins to roll that paradigm and cause you to lust for other things and become unhappy or discontent with what you have satan constantly bombards you and tries to use this method as he used with eve to get us to a place where we're no longer satisfied with christ satisfied with the word satisfied with waiting on him to unfold himself and bring us the things that are necessary or holding to the one thing is necessary and we get sucked into this com economy where there's these transactions of knowledge and now experience and worldly knowledge without wisdom wisdom of the word is destructive it's deceiving it was plato who said all kinds of knowledge if knowledge of the best is lacking hinder rather than help him who has them think about that for a second all kinds of knowledge hinder rather than help him who has them if he lacks the best knowledge everything we know in the world everything we're learning everything we're experiencing everything we keep up with even in your hobbies and your pursuits and your recreation there's a lot of things that are not unlawful in themselves but if you're somebody who loves technology and you love the latest and you love certain things you can get so wrapped up in that and have a lot of knowledge of it but if you've forgotten and letting go of the knowledge of that is best that knowledge hinders you rather than helps you if the knowledge of the best is lacking the good part that mary chose the the the one thing that is necessary if that lacks the knowledge of the best discernment of the word of god wisdom by the word of god understanding by the word of god if that lacks then all the knowledge that we accumulate in this world is to our detriment just as data without proper analytics is useless deceiving misleading without the ability to gain insight and find value and information all that information is worthless and human knowledge is merely just the accumulation of facts as humans we can gather fact in fact in fact in fact and learn to learn a lot about fact but only by god's wisdom can we make sense of it only by god's wisdom can you take a fact and be able to say well this fact is one thing and this fact is very interesting and that's very factual but only wisdom can take that fact and make it fit somewhere that's beneficial there's got to be a higher wisdom there's a lot of facts that we're bombarded with every day but we need god's wisdom to make sense of it real risk wisdom is the simplification of data and information and facts that's what wisdom can do and that's what we find sometimes within particular industries or people with particular skills you can be overwhelmed with a bunch of information and somebody who has wisdom and that can say wait a minute i know it looks a little overwhelming right now but watch this and be able to piece things together to make sense of the information that skill set that you could see in industry and you can see it with particular people in worldly pursuits or worldly disciplines that's the kind of wisdom that you can have as a believer to navigate you throughout this entire world i say amen to that that there's a wisdom that god can give you that will allow you to make sense of all the information that's bombarding you on a daily basis because all learning and knowing and accumulation of information is worthless without revelation all kinds of information will hinder us rather than help us if knowledge of the best is lacking i so if you i want to skip towards the end there in our slideshow and bring this to an end i'd mentioned it in my prayer recently and it was something i had been thinking about about a rubik's cube and they say that a rubik's cube if you could just find that slide brother john and um and just so that everyone knows what i'm talking about and you could just cycle right there we go does that look familiar to anybody but lucas did you bring yours tonight no the night that i had shared that in the in the prayer he was actually holding one later on uh and we shared some just he was testifying to some things and it was very inspirational but this rubik's cube how many knows what this is raise your hands if you know what this is it's a very old school toy the traditional three by three rubik's cube that you're looking at right here has over 43 quintillion possible arrangements that that's the number in that little thing that you can hold in the palm of your hand just a regular three by three rubik's cube or smart cube and there's other words that they have for it or magic cube it has over 43 quintillion that's the number of all the different possible arrangements that you could have from that device that you're holding in your hand this rubik's is the thing that you could turn around and and you could flip around there's that many different permutations or arrangements of the colors and the levels and all the different dimensions that are represented in that 40 over 43 quintillion different arrangements but only one correct solution now think about that you can twist that thing around over 43 i'm not talking billions trillions i'm talking about quintillions right i i didn't know how to conceptualize that we're not quite to a brazilian yet but we're getting close right a quintillion of different possible you're sitting there with the rubik's cube in your hand and you're flipping it around and you can get it to if you had enough time 43 quintillion different possible arrangements of all the colors on all the different surfaces the six sides of that cube but only one right answer and not to make this life seem like needle in the haystack but there's a lot of ways to death there's a lot of ways to chaos there's a lot of ways to confusion but there's only one way to life there's a lot of different ways to die but there's only one way to live and really in this life that i want to describe to you and somehow get it in your mind that you have in your life with life you have this rubik's cube in your hand and you look at it maybe some of the young people that are here or maybe some who can are getting a little bit of a wave of nostalgia the first time you ever had one and it was all perfect but then you get it all mixed up and something inside you said oh i know how to do this you got to get the blue here the green there the yellow i know how to do this and you get it all together and you get your blue and then like wait a minute well how do i get and then so you try to get the other one and everything's messed up again and you start looking and you you find in your mind thinking how do you ever get this thing right again i know it was at one time so logically there's got to be a way to get it back anybody ever do those puzzles those unlocking puzzles and sometimes they're just metal locks so they're different things and you try to figure them out and you're playing with it and you get it and finally you get it by accident you unlock it and then to really solve it you've got to get it back together and you spend much more time trying to figure out a way to get it back together and google's your friend right you got to look up a youtube video to figure out how to get it back together why because you're lacking the understanding of even how it worked and it seems impossible it seems complicated and they say that anyone who solves the puzzle quickly cannot do it by sheer intuition there's no way that you can solve this puzzle just by intuition but they do it with memorized sequences of moves called algorithms which they deploy to solve the cube section by section so if you're going to solve this you've got to know the algorithm and in order to solve it quickly you can sit there and play with it for hours upon hours and finally get it right and they say all right how did you do it how many moves did it take well i don't know thousands getting close to a quintillion moves you can't repeat it again but those who are able to do it very fast they don't just take a cube and just like my intuition can can fix it people do that do magic right it's a magic cube and there's you know if you want to buy the book on that you can find one we're talking about people can actually take a cube and then solve it very very quickly they know the algorithm to get to a solution with so many moves now just using this example and if i've completely lost you i'm sorry i'll bring it back to the word here as we close there was there's an approach to it it seems complicated and on one hand say well this should be easy all you got to do is get the colors to match but then as you begin to move things you're like well wait a minute this doesn't make sense why does this keep happening but once you understand how it works once you begin to recognize the algorithm to it the basis or the foundation then once you once that is established once you know it and as we're literally just talking about the hobby of solving a rubik's cube then you can know and use those algorithms in the situation that you're in now to make the step to the word of god we cannot think that we're going to make it through this world by simply having human intuition and be able to figure out how to get out of these different situations that we find ourselves in but we need something added to us some sort of basis some sort of foundation by divine revelation have a spiritual algorithm that can make sense of every single nonsensical thing that laodicea tries to throw at you how did you solve that it's by an algorithm it's by a spiritual knowledge by spiritual wisdom by spiritual understanding that's been added to me by revelation something that almost begins to become first nature in first instinct to where when you find yourself in that situation you say hold still steady hold steady family whole steady family and honey we've been here before this is what you need to do in this situation and not just give up and walk away from it frustrated but say god wouldn't bring me into this situation we wouldn't be faced with this task we wouldn't be having these challenges if god didn't have some way to make sense of all of it the brother bram says the church is built on revelation on the thus saith the lord that's what we're built on we're built on the thus saith the lord the very next page he says how did abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to god by faith he received the revelation of the blood cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice it was a revelation from god that made the difference and gave abel eternal life if we could think in terms of the baptism of the holy ghost and which is being born again by the power of god and by the spirit of god yes that's a revelation the new birth is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you that means revelation means more than we could express but in the same way to someone who has the holy spirit it's the revelation of god that continually makes the difference brother branham says in invisible union he said cain failed to keep that word he failed to have the revelation and the revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word i don't think you can qualify it except to say it's the only thing and since it's the only thing it is everything it's the one thing that in being the only thing is everything because it's it's for everything we and i i realized too that maybe it's just my my analytical mind or the way that it can work or immediately you start thinking well does that mean you have to have a revelation when you go to get a glass of milk tonight before you go to bed we're not getting on we're not being nonsensical with it i i i'm speaking to things that matter to all of us and something may matter to more to you than it matters to me and more to somebody else and it matters and we have all of us have these different levels of experience and challenges and things we're going to and we're trying to figure things out and we might even be looking at situations in our lives and despairing is it too late is this too far gone how are we going to figure this out how are we going to navigate it the pressures we feel the sense of loss that's pressing in upon us and it's making us afraid to act or maybe the fact we feel like we've let an opportunity pass us by and there's really no way to recover from it the loss of everything a bad decision whatever these things might be do you realize tonight that revelation is an answer to whatever it is you're going through and i'm not just kind of throwing it out there in the ether somewhere it's just something you got to kind of grasp at you can ask god to give you a revelation for the situation you're specifically in say lord i need something right now i really really need to know that i'm where you want me to be i really really need to know where you want me to go i really really don't need to know what to do with my children i need to know what to do with my finances i need to know what to do about where i'm going to church and get serious with god about these decisions and ask god to give you a revelation with the revelation the truth is the circumstance never even needs to change right i'm not telling you to stop believing for a change in circumstance but a revelation can change the way you conduct yourself towards it absolutely it can give you an absolute revelation of something you can stand solid on it and you can endure you can persevere you can undergo and you could find yourself in a situation where you have the right kind of attitude in whatever it is you're going through and how are you able to do that revelation you say there's no way i could go through this if god hadn't given me a revelation that he's going to get me through it you may be calling on god get me over it get me around it get me get take it away from me it says no i'm going to bring you through it and if you can have a revelation he's going to get you through it that's going to be the best thing that could happen to you you realize god why did i ever ask for him to take me around it do you realize that even in the way the methods that we come up with for deliverance and change and the way we want things to unfold is actually it lacks the wisdom and understanding of god because it can bring us to the threshold of something and we're asking god to take us around it but yet we've got to there's something we've got to experience in it and it's for our benefit but it can also be for to the detriment of satan just even we as we've been reading through the bible as a family and you come to the children of israel come to the red sea now it seems like there could have been a better way to cross it but god brought them to it and then opens it up you think oh he opened it up so that it would it would show his mighty hand but you know the real reason why god opened up those seas because he wanted to destroy pharaoh's army once and for all had he brought the children of israel some other way they would have been thinking what if the egyptians have the same way what if they figured it out just as their gods were able to uh turn the their rod into serpents just like aaron what if their magicians are able to come up with some other trick and at any moment we're going to hear the hooves of these horses and the chariots roaring in the in the wilderness coming after so god wanted to visibly before all of israel say i'm gonna let you cross on dry land and that's maybe one part a small part of my deliverance but what i really want you to see is the very thing i brought you through is the very thing that i'm using to destroy the power of the enemy over you and how else could you stand in a situation like that and believe that what i have gone through what god has done for me is not only for my benefit and for his glory but god will use it to bring about permanent change and to vanquish the power that the enemy had over me for so long brother mike if you could come this evening brother branham says this page 30 of the church age book if revelation is beyond you look up and seek god for it that is the only way you're ever going to get it revelation has to come from god it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual endowment revelation resolves complication but you're going to have to ask for it wisdom can resolve complication you're going to have to ask for it knowledge understanding discernment these are things that you have to ask for and if it's beyond you you realize how simple he made it this is how simple god makes it well i don't know what revelation is i don't know if i've ever had it where do i even start look up and ask god for it so he comes to this conclusion we've heard it before here at the bottom of the slide we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world but do i i need to call upon god for healing i need to call upon god to be able to speak in tongues i need to call upon god that we can have a move of the holy spirit and people are slain in the spirit and people are dancing and people are jumping and people are shouting that's what we need to call upon god for those things are wonderful they're in the word of god and they feel really really nice but more than anything we need to call upon god for revelation more than anything we need to call upon god for revelation because it's revelation that's going to resolve it no matter what you're going through whatever you're experiencing well those are pretty uh pretty bold statements but they're the truth revelation revelation from the smallest most minute thing to the grandest into the biggest that's what we need whatever it is you're facing in this life that you're going through whatever age you're at i could even say for my own daughter where she's at in her life right now she can call upon god and ask him for revelation whatever the frustrations may be whatever the anxieties whatever the difficulties may be even in difficulties with siblings i could look at my my sons and i could say that they can call upon god and ask god for revelation say lord give me wisdom how to navigate these things i was wanting to go to revelation chapter 3 and how that god answers to the condition of the laodicea by giving counsel and brother branham when he comes to the point of having isab to see he refers to it as being a spiritual revelation of the word in doing so you're turning away from instincts of the flesh you're turning away from the wisdom of man you're turning away from all these other things you're turning away from thinking that just by sheer intuition you can do something with this rubik's cube but turn away from your own intuition lean not to your own understanding and then completely turn to the word of god as as being totally dependent and reliant constantly reveals a greater depth to which it can reach and our own personal lives when we feel as if we found that limit other that you begrudge any little one here tonight that you resent any open heart that is before you today and that if anyone here needs some something from you they can ask right now in faith believing and they can receive it even if it's a heart that was to say lord i believe help thou my unbelief you are a god that despite our unbelief is willing to help us in it because we believe you can i'm asking father on behalf of those that are gathered here tonight the many that stream those who may take time in the future to listen to this service on some archive lord may they take heart right now knowing that you're calling to them that something's speaking to them something's opening up an opportunity and may we right now all of us make this conscious decision to turn away from our human intuition our human understanding and our complicated mind and look to christ the word and say you are the dissolver of doubts you're the one that can make sense of all this and ask you for revelation to ask that by that revelation it could give us a gift of discernment for the situation that we're in that it can endure us with spiritual wisdom that we could possess an understanding that we could gain a scriptural knowledge that is fruitful that is beneficial for the circumstances that we find ourselves in lord i pray for your people tonight that you would bless them that you would anoint them that you would strengthen them that you would encourage them and that we would leave here feeling a greater appreciation for revelation that we can use it for everything we can take it with us wherever we go never let it go from our hands we commit all things to you tonight now bless us as we are dismissed in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
