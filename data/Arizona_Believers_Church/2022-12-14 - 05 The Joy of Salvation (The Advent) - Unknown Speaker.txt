TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is a continuation of the subject of the joy of Salvation and tonight we're taking the title of the Advent and we'll touch on that here in a moment just uh that very familiar phrase for many people during this time of year but just a few statements at the outset quickly about what we ministered on Sunday and just to kind of reset because we are continuing on though we're going to be speaking on the Advent or his coming uh there's this when we looked at tis the season it was uh I could maybe summarize it this way that our joy should be in the present work of God that he's doing in the time that we're living in and we praise them for what he's done we look forward to what he's going to be doing but the real pure joy and the true joy we have is in what God is doing present tense we know that God is a present tense God he says he's the I am so where he's working presently what he's doing presently is where you're going to really find your strength and the Bible says the joy of the Lord is my strength it's our happiness in the work that he is doing and happiness in what he's doing right now and that's where we take taking that phrase of tis the season that this is the season uh for something it's a time period the appropriate time the appropriate moment and what we really emphasize as we looked into trying to do God of service without it being his will the example there Nehemiah in different places that the open of the seals begins our season or is our season of Joy it's our time of rejoicing and we read that state where Brethren said talk about a happy time what was he referring to when those seals were open it was a happy time brother Branham said that when that seventh seal is opened everything is worship so that's the season that we're living and it's a time of Praise it's a time of worship it's a time of rejoice and you say well brother Aaron was it a time of rejoicing a hundred years ago yes was the time rejoicing 300 years ago yes it's it's a there's always reason to praise there's always reason to Rejoice but we don't want to be rejoicing in a former light we want to be rejoicing in the light of God's word for the time that we're living in and so those are just some summary thoughts on tis the season tonight on the Advent uh I'm sure that you all have seen um Advent calendars maybe some of you are doing your Advent chocolates and things like that anybody any young people doing the Advent calendars that have chocolates in them come on Jack raise your hand I know you're doing it and uh he's the only one I know in my family who's maybe saving them day you know for the appropriate day but the uh they do these things and we're so we're familiar with the terminology and it really is a kind of a phrase that's used in the nominal churches it's a season of their church year they have different seasons and different times and they're celebrating Christ's birth so the Advent in a nominal church or in Catholicism and denominations they have the Advent and it's this season it's a four Sunday Cycle that usually ends on Christmas Eve or the Feast of epiphany and it is a time where they're celebrating Christ's birth and so as they as they come to celebrate his birth there's this anticipation there's this expectation you have so many chocolates and did you get down and you're finally at the last one you know you've arrived at the time when Christ was born that they they observe his birth we know he wasn't born in December and so it's not only connected to his first coming but they also join into it the Advent is as it kind of looks to the expectance of this baby coming and that time when the baby was born that it also is joined with the second Advent of Christ the expectation of his return so those are some of the themes that the people use the churches use when it comes to Advent I think with last year when we preached on Christmas we looked at how holidays originally referred to the holy days and the old English as a whole holiday is a holy day and it referred to the season of Advent and so that's what we're actually preaching on is the Advent but I want to use it in this sense which the word just itself would mean an important arrival it comes from a Latin phrase that means to arrive or to come to this conjugation of this preface fix and suffix of um to come that's what it means this Advent it means to come or to arrive and the word could have actually been used in the scripture in different places that's translated to coming in Acts chapter 7 verse 52 it says which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers tell it like it is and so he's saying that it says before of the coming of the just one that word coming there's the Advent the the arrival of the one that the coming that's what it's translated to is this word could have been or the Advent the arrival of our of the just one and so this is how it's used in the book of Acts and the same thought is in this in Matthew chapter 24 verse 27 it says for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be the word there could have been Advent and it but yet it's translated to coming but in its definition and the Lexicon as you look at what the word means in the Greek it refers to an advent or an arrival the word itself means it's the presence is translated to presence the presence or a rival comes from the word to be alongside of or to be with to be to be present with so when we say Advent and a lot of times think this is important when we think about Cummings we think about in a moment we'll be changing the twink of an eye will be changed and so we think as Lightning lighted from the East to the West we kind of Imagine The coming or an advent to just kind of be like this snatch just real quick like a frog sticking out his tongue gets the fly and the tongue retracts and it happens so fast we don't know what happened but the word doesn't imply just a real quick visitation but an advent or a coming again it's not a brief appearance but it's an arrival and a lingering alongside of it's a presence with and that's what his first coming was when he came as a baby in the manger it wasn't just making an appearance as a baby but he grew up to full stature he was offered as a sacrifice it was all these different things that were manifested in that season and so an advent is not just a quick appearance but it's an arrival and a continued presence with and so there's two things I want to I've been wanting to just find the right place to use it and we could spend a lot of time on either one of these principles but how this was originally inspired to me as I was reading through the scriptures and studying different things is you'll find that his coming is always and often associated with joy and salvation and there's ways that you can begin to track it to her when it speaks of his coming it has to do with salvation and where there's salvation there ought to be joy and so there's different ways that it's phrased it's presence and joy is linked togethers his coming and salvation linked together joy and salvation are linked together and so there's a lot of places that these things are joined together so I want to look at how his comment is associated with salvation It's associated with joy and I would say that the subject of the coming of the Lord which whether you're looking at his first coming his second coming no matter what coming you're looking at as of critical importance and as a matter of fact Peter prophesies that in the last days it's going to be the very message of his coming that's scoffed at the very messy of his coming is what it is is what they laugh at and they score and they deride and they try to delude the truth of so it's something that's very important and be an important and being scoffed at it's very easy for it to be misunderstood and it can be controversial so I want to use this statement from question and answers to um to settle your hearts and to uh acknowledge the power of God in your life to reveal to you the word that you need to know and that you need to understand and that it's not it's not the preacher's job to explain it to you it's not the preacher's job to interpret to you interpret it to you but a man of God must be faithful to what the Bible has said and faithful to what the prophet is taught and desirous that it would be quickened to you that it would be revealed to you what what is meant in the word of God so I read this and in reading it I'm wanting to acknowledge the holy spirit in your life to speak to you what the word of God is what it is in the word of God what the prophet wanted you to know and and also to hold myself accountable to what the prophet said and you'll find this statement is just so on point I know you're probably familiar with it but to me it's one of the most um one of the outstanding quotes that I like to always have very near me he says I can say one thing and I'm so misunderstood or say it's this way or that way and one gets it way on this side and so that just think about that statement I can say one thing and I'm misunderstood or say it's this way or that way and one gets it way on this side so I say it this way one gets it over here and now he describes it and the way it is you say something right straight towards a point and one hears it this way so he tells another one and leans a little farther and the next one leans a little farther and next a little farther and then it's like it's got Plum out of cater is this not exactly what happens Prophet says something then the next the person hears it a little they hear it kind of in this slant so they repeat that and then the next person's already kind of leaning and before you know it it's gone way away from what he intended because he says one hears it this other way and he goes this way that way and that way see and you get away and the way that he describes it very well brother Ram could make one statement that's straight to the point and one hears it this way and then they tell another person they lead a little bit this way and they end up over here and then the same statement he makes someone hears it this way and it leans this way and leans this way and you can have people bait on the same statement divided just as far as East is from the West so he says see and you get away and that's the way it is out in the meetings and so forth when you're really driving right to a spot so he's wanting to make a point he's wanting to hammer something down he's one and he has something he needs to say and he says he's misunderstood uh some hear it a certain way to kind of hear it through their filter and when they filter it and one gets a little bit further and that's how people get very extreme on some ideas he says now the elected would hear that spot they get that spot and you're the elected that he's talking about brother Bradham says something in the message of the hour it's preserved for us you can hear it for yourself isn't it beautiful that you can hear it for yourself what a privilege that we can hear it for ourselves that we ought to have a burden that other believers who know other languages can hear it in their language hear it for themselves so that they can hear that spot they get that spot they know because I said just exactly was meant like that just the message just exactly and so there's that way that brother Branham said things and he's trying to drive a point home he wants us to hear something and there's ways that it can be pulled into extremes but what we want to know is we want to get that spot we want to know exactly what brother Branham was saying and so that I think that's an important statement to always keep in mind when it comes to the message of the hour now just a couple scriptures to establish this principle though there's many that could be used and you're always welcome to share with me the ones that the Lord has inspired to you I enjoyed the fellowship around the things of God and the scripture but it's coming in Salvation to get the coming is associated coming it's coming in Salvation or associated with joy and here is a scripture in Isaiah chapter 25 verses 8 and 9. so we look at his coming and salvation both those things his coming and salvation are associated with joy it says in Isaiah chapter 25 verses 8 and 9 he will swallow up death and victory when did Paul say that was going to happen when the Last Enemy which is death is placed under your feet then it shall be brought to pass the saying that death is swallowed up in Victory so we see this as an end time prophecy and promise and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall be taken away from all the Earth from off all the Earth for the Lord hath spoken it and it shall be said in that day Lo This Is Our God we have waited for him and he will save us so there's the Salvation this the Salvation to come this looking forward to this anticipation of what this very deliverance from Death the Salvation from Death this Last Enemy being defeated says we've waited for him he tear it and he waited and he waited and he waited but he will come we've waited for him and he will save us this is the Lord we have waited for him him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation so you see some of those themes in this his coming to defeat death this waiting for him to arrive and he arrives and when he does it brings forth this power that defeats death and it says we've waited for him but now he's come and so we will rejoice in his salvation this is his coming and his salvation being associated with joy because it says we'll be glad and rejoice in it we'll rejoice in his salvation in Isaiah chapter 66 verse 5 it says hear the word of the Lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my name's sake said let the Lord be glorified but he shall he but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed he is going to make himself known he's going to manifest himself and it's going to be to your joy to your excitement to your enthusiasm to your to your rejoice and he shall appear to your joy and you'll find other places where a little bit different language is used and other prophecies to where his his coming is a deliverance and his or his arrival his his coming to your Aid to avenge you and you're you so that you're not disappointed and and that is cause for rejoice and it's cause for celebration it's a cause to be happy you'll find it even in the Exodus in different places where he has become our Salvation And there's this rejoicing that's associated with it and I'll say this maybe as a second principle to build upon his coming and salvation or associated with joy and then I want to support this that his coming is is for the purpose of salvation and maybe that's a broad statement that you could find uh may just be stating the obvious but his coming is for the purpose of Salvation that's both his first coming and his second coming it's for the purpose of Salvation we read at the outset in Luke Chapter 2 verses 10 and 11 that the Angels when they gave the pronounced announcement to the Shepherds they said I bring you good tidings of great joy and what what's the what's the course that we seek Joy to the World the Lord Has Come and it said of his arrival as a baby his birth is a baby in a manger and it says uh we bring you great Tidings or Good Tidings of great joy for a savior has been born Christ the lord has been born in the city of David so here's the announcement of his birth and it's associated with great joy and he's a savior and so his coming is associated with joy or his comment is associated with salvation and joy in Luke chapter 5 verse 32 he says I come not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance so he said I've come for the purpose of sinners sinners repenting and in doing so finding salvation it says in Chapter 19 Verse 10 for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost hear his hear his ministry is for the purpose of salvation and remember what time and I know I I know I've said this before it happened a number of years ago and it was really striking to me I was with a minister fellowshipping and somehow our conversation veered into uh we are overseas ministering and he mentioned the out there are certain subjects that people disagree on and debate on and and I don't know if he really meant this or he just wasn't thinking but he said you know there's just some things that aren't salvation issues and and I'm thinking uh yeah okay what what would that be maybe Christmas lights or something and he said you know like the coming of the Lord he said that's not a Salvation issue and I just remember feeling like I just been flattened you know by one of those Earth rollers or whatever because I was like wait a minute you could have put any subject maybe in the word of God that we could have debated whether or not it was a Salvation issue other than his coming right like that's so that's the whole point of it is is salvation and so I I say I share that just to say it's very uh this is such a critical subject his coming is always associated with salvation and Christ has mentioned this I'm I'm coming to call Sinners to repentance what for that they might be saved and rescued from their sin I come I come to seek and to save that which was lost his coming was as a messiah to save the people and then it says in Hebrews chapter 9 verse 28 so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many this is his first coming be a sacrificial lamb to shed his blood in order for this the salvation of the of those that he was sent to and unto them that look for him now it's a separate coming unto him that looked for him shall he appear the second time without sin not to deal with sin but unto for the purpose of salvation and that's and so this is an in this is an important uh concept to recognize his first coming was for salvation the to pay the price for sin as it says he was Christ was offered to Bear the sins of many so it's in the shedding of blood pain the price of redemption but he is promised to appear a second time a second coming to make himself visible to make himself known and it will be for the purpose of Salvation again and it has to do with that second part of redemption it has to do with the the very purpose of Salvation to begin with this the the entering into the taking possession of and so he appears a second time not to deal with sin but for full salvation a Deliverance the Bible is speaking of them and now we're familiar with the number of statements that brother branna makes with respect to this as he says and it is I be not afraid he comes three times as what we we see him teaching first coming to redeem his bride second coming to catch his bride away third time coming with his bride so his first coming as a lamb as a sacrifice to shed the blood to die upon a cross to raise again on the third day that is that these are those those are elements a part of that first coming and in that it is to pay the price to redeem his bride and the second time he appears without sin unto salvation that's the second coming to catch his bride away and there's also a third coming that's when he comes with his bride and Peter prophesies of this second coming in First Peter chapter 1 verse 5. speaking of the elect he says who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time what does this tell us that there is a Salvation that is going to be revealed in the end times so it's the revelation of Salvation there's going to be a revelation in time and in that Revelation there is salvation and Paul Peter is writing this that the elector kept by the power of God through faith and that there's going to be a keeping of all the elect Through the Ages until a time when salvation is revealed in the end pays the price of redemption in his first coming then there's going to be a revelation in the end which is going to be the climax and the the perfecting of all those that sleep there's going to be a Salvation revealed in the last time so Peter picks it up eight verses later in verse 13 He says wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end why does he tell us to hope to the end because there's going to be a Salvation revealed in the end he's told us this in verse 5 he says hope to the end for the grace salvation is by Grace he says for the grace that is brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ so if there's going to be a Salvation that's revealed in the last time there is no salvation outside of Jesus Christ so it's going to be a revelation of Jesus Christ and in the revelation of Jesus Christ it brings to us a Grace and it is the Salvation at the end time so this end time salvation at the he shall appear the second time for the purpose of Salvation this end time salvation comes by the revelation of Jesus Christ or the coming of Jesus Christ it says making known this manifesting of Jesus Christ you find that even as we read already in Matthew 24 it's the revealing of the son of man the revealing of the sentiment is the coming of the son of man scripture those those two things are the very same in those prophecies in Matthew 24 Luke 17. and so brother Brandon makes this statement this way and the sermon broken cisterns and you all are very attentive tonight listening uh very intently so I feel that the point is being accepted and we're able just to move quickly and the sermon broken systems brother Brown says so he comes first to redeem his bride he comes second as a rapture I think that's an important way that he uses this language he comes second as a Rapture to take away his bride the Lord himself shall descend and we know that there is a shout voice and Trump he does all three as he's descending and the shout is the message and so these are things it's a messenger revealing that it's a the voice of God that's uh bringing forth the bride as he teaches us these things in the Rapture so he comes a second time as a Rapture to take away his bride he comes a third with his bride king and queen he says after he says and he says that's when many people are expecting the coming and what he is identifying is most people have in their mind the third coming when they're instead of the second coming when they're thinking about the next coming does that make sense they have in their mind the image and the visual and the promises and actually maybe the uh certain uh characteristics that would be associated with the third coming that's what they believe to be the next coming or the second coming and so they get that in their minds oh this this is what we're looking for this is what's going to happen and brother brahm's kind of identifying that that there is a third coming that has a certain representations and certain images and they're looking to that and in looking to that they're expecting that but they've got it out of order because Christ in his second coming he does the Corporal body does not return back to the Earth uh to set feet on Earth that's in his third coming and so when that's what Believers believe they believe that Christ will return and Rule and Reign on the earth uh there will be a thousand year reign but that's not the second coming and as a matter of fact there's if you want to start getting our head dizzy with Cummings not only does he reveal himself to the Gentiles but he's going to reveal himself to the Jews and that's a coming that's a that's a that's a coming that brother Brennan refers to in the message it's a coming that's referred to in the scripture he says but when he comes this time this time to come as a Rapture to take away his bride he says hardly none but those who are ready will know when he comes to those that look for him will he appear to those who are looking for him to those who are constantly in the word and know what to look for to those who know how he's going to make himself known in this time they're going to recognize him and how he chooses to make himself known is so that we will know him as our bridegroom so that we'll know him as our savior in this end time and so these are just a number of principles I think that uh are important for us to understand I don't I don't believe that we've had opportunity to this point to maybe go through some of these scriptures with you over the last couple years so these are just good maybe just to enter into our thought process begin to consider them as a church and chew on them and find where brother Brennan places them in the scripture now to connect this with what we were preaching on Sunday on tis the season and how the time and season that we're living in has to do with the open of the the word of God the open of the seals in the sermon the breach and now when brother Branham preaches the breach he he takes us to the spot where he says the church ages are finished we're coming to these seals and he's preaching the breach and he's talking about the breach between I think even the full titles of the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals so when he's preaching that keep that in mind the breach is between Church ages that he feels very comfortable about how the loose sins have been tied up certain things have been established we're approaching the seals he's preaching the breach he's taken Revelations chapter five he says now he comes to take his bride what is this relating to is he says the the first coming the second coming to catch his bride away he comes second as a Rapture to take away his bride now the ram is looking at this and he says he comes to take his bride he comes now as king he's looking for his Queen this isn't coming with his Queen this is the king looking for his Queen in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped around Seven Seals Seven Seals waiting for him to come to what come take the book and the loose the seal so now he comes to take his bride and is coming to take his bride it's visually represented even in this idea of Christ or this image of Christ coming forward to take a hold of a book that's been sealed with Seven Seals and so we were reading in Revelations chapter 5 on Sunday how there was this book and the right hand of him that sat upon the throne of God and it was sealed with Seven Seals written within and without and there was this Proclamation by the strong Angel and I think we had a wonderful time around these things on Sunday uh who is worthy and now John begins to weep because when he says he's worthy there's no man that's worthy there's no no no one present maybe that anyone's thinking of well I'm not worthy and you're not worthy no one's found worthy but there was a worthy one and the strong Angel's voice is what Rouses him up and brings him forward to take a hold of this book and it says John says and I wept much Revelations chapter 5 verse 4 making really good time tonight we'll be we'll be home before the snow falls he says and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look or thereon I know these are very familiar phrases to you I know we have already covered them maybe in great detail already as a church and even recently so John is weeping because in his mind based upon the silence at that moment or the announcement and everyone kind of conceding we're not worthy that oh does this mean the book can't be opened so he's weeping and one of the elders saith unto me weep not so now that's not the time to cry John Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain it's the lamb but he's announced as the lion says having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne this is John describing what he saw this is what is visually being represented to John in this even the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ and these events that he's caught up to see and to witness and as he's a witness to this this sealed book now is being told he sees that the lamb has the lamb has come in prevailing as a lion to take a hold of the book and to loose the seals thereof he says and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne the season this taking of the book brother Branham refers to this as the most Sublime act in Scripture says this is the most Sublime thing in scripture he calls it a Sublime act and when you use the word sublime he's referring to the highest the most Supreme it's the it cannot be cannot be excelled can't be anything greater so when he takes us to this point he says the most Sublime thing in Scripture that cannot be excelled by anything else it's the highest most Supreme part then this is a very significant part in Scripture and it must have something to do with this coming it must have something to do with salvation and it must have something to do with our joy and it's something that we we cannot divorce from his first coming and it's something that we don't want to misplace or misunderstand but this taking of the book it's the Kinsmen Redeemer taking this book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne to claim the title deed of redemption for those to whom it belongs Adam had lost something in the fall I think we've mentioned it here recently and just the way that uh it's described as Adam having lost the title deed of redemption it just struck me it was only as of late that it really struck me that I know it's just symbolic but the language is used to suggest that even while Adam had it it was called The Book of redemption and that was Adam's first clue that things were going to change right because as as of yet there was no Redemption there was no need for Redemption but Adam could have never known God and we would have never known God in his fullness without a form and so the book was a clue that God had this all planned it's called The Plan of Salvation we rejoice in the Plan of Salvation There's Something Beautiful in thinking about God's Plan of Salvation I know that there's a way that we take the word salvation and we kind of just relegate it to the Baptist well the Baptists have a Ministry of Salvation and these people want to get you saved but Salvation is the greatest thing it's a beautiful thing and so John's weeping as we see it in verse 4 and his mourning is turned into joy and rejoicing in verse 13 and we do not risk necessarily reading it tonight but he said everybody heard me Every Creature hurt me joy rejoicing and giving blessing and honor and glory and power to him that sits upon the throne and the lamb forever and ever because he has taken the book he has prevailed he's overcome to take the book and to loose the sales thereof and so what I want you to catch is we talked about a season change on Sunday and the season had changed from weeping to rejoicing the the the very description of John in one moment weeping much because no man is found worthy and then being told wait a minute the line of the tribal Judith prevailed to loose the seals thereof and now his weeping is turned into rejoicing it's symbolic of night being turned into day because the Weeping endures for the night the Bible says Psalms 30 verse 5 for his anger and Earth but a moment in his favor is life where is his favor declared in his countenance and a lot of the king's countenance there is life his in his favor his life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning so this is this is what happens to John is he's weeping in that dark time he's weeping in that unknown time he's weeping in the delay he's weeping in that moment well wait a minute what's going to happen here this is John who possessed salvation this is John who was there on the day of Pentecost this is John who who knew who the lamb was he's the one that knew the sacrifice he's the one that had received the uh the first uh fruits of it and he's enjoying it and he's walking in it but now through this delay in this dark time he begins to weep but when his weeping is turned into rejoicing that's symbolic of the sun coming up the weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning and what is what is one of those themes that brother Brandon begins to preach at the end of 1963 there's a man here who could turn on the light and Rapture that church now he didn't say a man come and he said there's a man here who could turn on the light and Rapture that church and he said and if you think now I like the I like the pool you guys are given tonight this is good did you notice the way you're seating is kind of like a gradient too I don't know if you notice that but they uh you're pulling really really well but there's a uh when he when he gives that when he preaches that very sermon he's given us this description kind of what inspires it and he uses as an example is how they went down into Carlsbad Caverns and this uh this sister and her older brother there's with them they go down and and they're in this great great big cavern and also the lights turn off and the little girl starts crying and she's getting all nervous she's crying and she says her little brother says don't worry honey there's a man here who could turn on the light and then brother Brandon when he just when he's sharing that uh sharing that um testimony he says because the brother was standing next to the man who could turn on the light so he's standing next to him and he's given us this perfect image of how don't worry Brian don't worry sister don't worry when it seems dark don't worry there's one who is standing near the man who could turn standing near the engineer maybe in the phrase he uses he said don't worry honey I know he's here and he has the power to turn on the light and Rapture that church and as he enters into 1964 he's preaching shalom shalom shalom preaches it here in Arizona he preaches this sermon I think even in Phoenix and what does he say preaching it's good morning to the church it's a Setting Sun to the world it's a Setting Sun on laodicea but now it's a Rising Sun it is the rise of the Sun and when he's preaching Shalom good morning to the bride what does that mean time of weeping is over joy cometh in the morning so our joy has been found in that Rising Sun and so brother Branham visits this in the sermon the breach and he says talk about a jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walked forth see the books even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are now think about this phrase because I'm going to come to this on Sunday says say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world again this is the breach preach after between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals so brother Branham even himself was in this time of what is this going to be there's things he doesn't know until they're actually open he says but I hope it is but if it was if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and this is now notice what brother Brown does in this this next statement he's talking about he's preaching the breach he's talking about the book that's sealed and he's talking about the lamb who's been slain before the foundation of the world and he took the book open the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people and this next phrase is great however you want to take it there you are there you are there you are right there you are and notice how what he has done and this is I think uh I was raising the message I've uh who spent my spent my last you know over 20 uh last 25 years or so or uh 27 years you know in the word of God studying the word of God uh fellowship and the word of God with people all over the world and Men of God and preachers around the world and Believers and so some of these things can be very controversial but I'm telling you you have to ignore the message to say that brother Branham wasn't tying Revelations 5 and Revelations 10 to his present Ministry because he says it right here he says he took the book open the seals tore off the seal sent down to earth to the seventh angel he revealed to his people he says there you are right and then when brother Branham is preaching these things in 1963 these things have tremendous weight especially considering what everyone was under expectation and prior preconceived ideas of how things would take place and even brother Branham himself is very heavy with the weight of what is transpiring and you want to talk about his heaviness I believe maybe we fellowshipped on it here uh before how brother Branham when he preached his souls in prison now he's saying oh we know what's happened we see what's taking place he says could it be then that we're at this time when these events have transpired and it's too late right I mean these are the questions that he's asking in that sermon and and I'm sure many of you could probably remember the first time you ever heard it and just how uh uh how much concern it would cause and the Weeping and even the seriousness and the stubbornness that brother Branham is using because he's recognizing that something significant has happened with respect to the open of the seals and and there was a way that you could look at it to say oh well then this means it's over the days salvation the door is shut it's finished he's claimed the last one and we are all now just he's like even if I could put it in my own words I didn't think we'd be here this long I didn't know it would take this long I don't know why we're still here maybe we're just now manifesting the word to people who can never be saved and that isn't that the theme of it and it's in that very sermon where he says Revelations 5 it's in paragraph 139 he says immediately it comes to Revelations 10 7. so there's a there's a this Revelations 5 7 is then immediately connected to Revelations 10 7. why because the book that's opened in Revelations 5 comes to the seventh angel on the earth to reveal it to the people and now I'll say this not to just leave the sermon souls in prison now as as the door being shot this is Brother Branham wrestling with the implication of what of what has happened in saying could it be and I believe things continue to unfold uh to where he he is very clear that the door of Salvation has not been shut that the things he's considering things he's looking at it's not wasn't the end of Salvation it wasn't no more no one could be saved from that moment on but he does make a statement to me that turns everything around at the very end he says think of it could it be and he's even referring I've got children out there there I've got lost loved ones he says could it be could this be and he goes and just to think of it we've made it right and he's saying we wait he's looking at the beauty of what has been made known is that there's something here available in the end time to snatch us from death into life there's something a quickening power that's come to us to preserve us and to keep us and that's where we want to be he says and to think of it oh yes there's a horrible side to all of this but just to think that there is a place that he wants to bring you into where he says I've made it I'm secure I'm safe and so in this um talk about a jubilee talk about rejoicing this time when the lamb comes forward and takes the book and he says now he sent it down to earth to Revelations 10 7. so in Revelations chapter 10 verses 1 to 3. he says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was the word the Sun and his feet his pillars of fire these are descriptions that have important meaning he has he's clothed the cloud and the rainbows upon his head it tells us this is a covenant angel and I'll say this this Mighty angel can be no one else other than Christ and he had in his hand a little book open this little book open is this book that is unsealed in Revelations 5 and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth so here's this connection back to the line of the tribe of Judah he this Mighty Angel which is Christ Roars as a lion he is the lion of the tribe of Judah and he cried with a loud voice is when a line wrote and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices now once these seven Thunders have uttered their voices John is getting ready to write and he's and he's told no don't write it seal up these things and so that means that what the mystery contained under those seven seals are going to be revealed in the seven Thunders but John is not going to write them so he says seal it up it's not that there's another set of seals it just means John is not going to write them they're going to be kept a secret until the time of the actual taking of the book and the revealing of these things and so and even if I could we could identify this and I know these things are just very apparent to you in the scripture that John at one time is present when it says who's worthy to take the book and to open it and the conclusion with John present is that nobody is worthy to take the book and to loose the seals there nobody's even worthy to look on it right they're not even worthy to look at this book and John is present so he has included as one who is unworthy but now that the book is opened and it's being sent back down to earth to be revealed uh to his people to God's people this King now coming uh looking for his Queen John here's the revelation of the seven Thunders and that is the significant event that takes John from somebody who wasn't even worthy to look on the book to be in one being told to go to him that has the book and ask for it and then being obedient to that he asked for it and not only does he ask for it and he's going to be given it but the mighty Angel then unfolds this very this other this other further part of this Revelation that comes when you're in audience with him he says take it and you can eat it now A lot's changed right if if we could just relate maybe these young men could rely on the front row that when you're told he's mom can I have a cupcake no don't don't you even touch it right and and how how much changes oh yeah you can have it you can eat it George full possession you can enjoy every bit of it what a change what changed what happened it was the season so revelation of those seven Thunders that revealed to John to John his worth and his right to take that book and then the angel and that personal audience he has with John says not only can you take it but you can eat it now brother Branham in the sermon the breach she says and here he returns back in the 10th chapter after the coming time that all the Mysteries is to be finished and the seals to be broke and proclaiming that time is no more so here he returns back this is this is him in this coming time after the coming time he's looking at these things in the breach and he's showing us that something is transpiring something's happening related to these things and then in the breach again he says and when the seals are broke and the Mysteries are revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with the rainbow over his head are you paying attention to this last statement here now remember this seventh angel is is on Earth at the time of this coming if you're familiar with the different statements that that were part of the uh commissioning to brother as John the Baptist 4 ran and notice so he used this phrase just as John was given his message the same time that Messiah come in the the days John knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him and we realized that in the scriptures over in Malachi 4 there's going to be one like John and Elijah to whom the word of God can come to what is he pointing to that in Revelations chapter 10 verse 1 down comes Christ The Mighty Angel the messenger Christ and he says the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming at the time that he comes this little book open the time when this unsealed book is coming down out of Heaven we're using a symbolic language right we're using a language that is according to the scripture but he says he's on Earth at the time of this coming these things are very important to this brother branham's Ministry and now in the sermon souls in prison now notice how he he places this he says the lamb came for what he had redeemed he come to claim what he had redeemed he says he's already got it right here in the book taken it from his hand now he's coming to receive what he has redeemed think of that phrase coming to receive what he has redeemed price is paid in his first coming he is the one that has the purchase price he's the one that has the receipt he's the one to say I'm worthy who's worthy to loose the seals well the one that paid the price the one who gave his life he's prevailed now uh he not only paid the price but now he says he comes to receive what he has redeemed that is his work says he's done he's come to receive it oh what a time he's it has proven it the seventh seal proved it does he tell us that the seventh still brings him back to Earth so these are all very significant things and profound things he says he come back and took the book of redemption notice it was to be the seventh Angel's message that was to reveal the Seven Seals Revelations 10 7. he says now you'll find it where we're going to find it in the scripture Revelations 10 7 is the one is the message to reveal the Seven Seals and he says this is what's happening he's coming to receive what he's redeemed he's coming to take it the seventh seal proves that he comes back and takes the book of redemption this is what's revealed by the seventh Angel's message and remember his coming is for the purpose of salvation and it's always a joy in the sermon trying to do God of service without it being his will this is the one he preached later in in Shreveport at the businessman's breakfast and I this is kind of tapping back into where we were last Sunday as we closed this evening he says now let us see what happened when God in his time and age remember we read a statement very similar we see what happens when God in his time and his age is not considered he sees see what happened when God in his time and age and His prophets are not considered just depend on theology priest denominationalism like we do today now closely it gets messed up it all gets messed up if the true spirit of God there so if the true spirit of God is there it'll direct it and do the word not just one place in the word the entire word for the entire age so there's a lot of things that maybe we could be directed to and and we and it's and it's directed to it be very careful that if you see the spirit of God directs to another part of the word be very careful uh you know to not just instinctively disagree because it's directed to the word the entire word for the entire age someone may be shining a little bit of light or put a little bit of emphasis on one part and if it's in the word for the age you can amen it right we don't want to reject things we don't want to get the wrong kind of attitude toward things that are just partial truths but what we rejoice in is when we can have the spirit of Truth direct us to the word for the entire word for the age the entire age the relevant portions to the time we're living in so he uses this example the day of Pentecost the spirit directed it right into that to Joel 2 28. why because that was the scripture for that time that was what was the scripture was for That season so the spirit directs it into the prophecy of that time the day of Luther directed it right into that that that Wesley in this last Pentecostal move so in each age the spirit directs him to the word and if you were living in that age that's the word that you want to see that's the word that you receive and that would be your cause for rejoicing he says but this is another age this is the calling out of the Bride this is the catch in a way of the Bride this is the bride calling time this is the time where there's a lot there's something that comes forth to bring forth the bride not for the purpose of a church Revival but for the purpose of a rapture this is another age this is the cone out of the Bride not 2 000 years ago at Pentecost or the repeat or the return of what Pentecost this is exactly what he's saying this is not just a repeat of Pentecost this is not just a return to Pentecost this is another age and he's skipping just a couple paragraphs he says now this it now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals have been opened this is what he's emphasizing this is what he's showing us this is the spirit directing us to the promise for our day Revelations 5 7 Revelations 10 7 Revelations 5 Revelations 10. this is the spirit of God pointing us to the mighty Angel descending Out of Heaven if we could just look at that as language that's descriptive of something transpiring because one thing to always remember that God that we only we use language and we use time and we use space to express something if you want to understand something we use language to describe it and we only make sense of it and that it occupies certain space and and it's relative to time we maybe look at those quantum mechanics and things we talked about before these different dimensions and way of understanding something but God is not bound by language time or distance and so if we were to say well if the Lord would come tonight and someone might say well if he's coming did he leave in time did he are they blasting on I-17 tonight is he going to get stopped you know is he what is he driving in does he have enough gas well God doesn't when God when he comes and a spirit comes it's not that God has to travel some great distance but when we think of it coming we immediately start thinking wow there's a Point of Departure there's a point of arrival that has to travel if you go somewhere you cover distance and in order to cover distance cover time right but God doesn't work that way that's not the way that God is so these are dispensations manifestations that's why we use a language to try to describe them and sometimes we have to we really need the Revelation to catch what it means and so when brother bear says the seventh angels on Earth at the time of this coming you know to use a language that we could understand what's transpiring is that those things that were sealed up for the end time the Salvation that was being held back waiting for the last days to be revealed the open of those seals reveals to us who Jesus Christ it is the revelation of Jesus Christ that brings the grace the Capstone comes crying Grace Grace salvation has been brought to us at the revelation of Jesus Christ in this end time that is the bride's salvation that is the bride's rejoicing not a repeat or return to Pentecost but it is the Christ that brought those disciples to their Pentecost it's the same Christ bringing us to our Capstone in the end so have you ever pondered it I don't know where we are in the Ponder bingo but have you ever pondered the last very last statement in the church age book do you know what it is anybody know what the very very you can I guess you can Google it if you want but the very last statement of the churches book remember brother bran preaches the breach it's between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and his book on the seven Church ages ends with this phrase in the statement and may his coming Rejoice your heart isn't that beautiful and may his coming Rejoice your heart why because there's something that his ministry introduced us to there's something that's restored back to us in the message of the hour that is Christ that is our cause of rejoicing I know there's people that have made it cultish I know there's some people that heard it this way and lean further this way lean further this way but it's nothing other than the truth of Christ revealed in this scripture being restored back to the his people to know him in his reality to gnome and his nature to gnome and his character to settle the sin question to empower us to Rise Above All The Temptations of laodicea to put us in the track that we can rise above uh the the all the things in the word in the world so that the word can give faith and and energy to our wings to finally triumph over death I know there's a way we can make it weird but you know what it just is different on its own as it is there's no reason we should try to make it weird and try to make it different it is in its reality it is in its truth and it's something that's precious to us and brother about him that's what he ends this church age but with may his coming Rejoice your heart that is our rejoicing in our cause of joy as Paul writes in first Thessalonians 2 19 he says for what is our hope our joy or crown of rejoicing what is it what is your hope your joy or crown of rejoicing and he says are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ it is coming in other words what is it what is it you're looking to for your happiness what is it you're looking to in his presence is the fullness of joy is what the scripture teaches us he says what is it what's our hope what's our joy what's our crown of rejoicing and he asks this question as a way of sinter and our joy on Christ he says are you not in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ that is coming it's his presence that his presence is our joy his presence is our strength that's presence not with it ents it's a different presence but that's our joy the brothers if they'd come to their instruments my last statement here this evening from the sermon broken cisterns it's a sermon that there's a lot you can pull from on this subject he says why don't you turn to him where God is our abundant supply of joy our abundant Supply and praise our abundant Supply and satisfaction the calmness of my nerves comes from God when I'm tore up I find my satisfaction in Christ not in a cigarette not on the things of the world not enjoying some Creed but in finding him there's so many things that are offered to us these days it may not be a cigarette it could just be a lavender bath right it may not be in the things of the world it's just this the respite I just need to watch a movie to let off some esteem or I want to I want to go golfing I need to go fishing and I want to do this there's all sorts of ways that we're looking for some sort of recreation to calm our nerves they just need to do something to calm my nerves he says the calmness of my nerves comes from God I find my satisfaction in Christ not in cigarettes not in the things of the world not enjoying some Creed but notice how he phrases this but in finding him the promised word that he said if I go away I'll come again to receive you I find my joy in that that's a statement I find my joy in that he is my joy find your joy in the promised word I would take a promise of God and tie myself to it if I was you and what better promises to tie yourself to than the ones that are being fulfilled right now think about this this very scripture even as we go into Sunday morning service on Sunday he says if I go away I'll come again to receive you he comes a second time to catch his bride away he comes second as a Rapture to take his bride away he comes now as king he's looking for his Queen he comes [Music] to receive and he says I find my joy in that let's find our joy in that can we stand tonight [Music]
