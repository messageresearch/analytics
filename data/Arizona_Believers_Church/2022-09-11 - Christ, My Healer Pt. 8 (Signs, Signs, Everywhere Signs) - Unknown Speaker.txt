TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a few statements just to point back to where we were last time this is part eight on christ my healer i have been laying a foundation through these first eight services i could continue to do so i think in perpetuity so just today i'm desiring just the end off on the on the foundation if there's any more foundational things i'll shove it off to maybe another series and we want to uh maybe get into the aspects of divine healing but last time we looked at the subject of elevated faith and we saw how this elevated faith uh is connected with divine healing and so we kind of connected divine healing to the rapture or one way i think of really looking at it is the death of christ the shedding of his blood purchased our salvation and full salvation is more than i'm saved i'm forgiven or just even how we use those terminologies sometimes to refer to something they're not but it re the fullness of salvation is not just to live a christian life and then go to a grave but the fullness of salvation is full redemption and so divine healing is kind of that forward-looking signal that there's more to this there's more to this there is a change of the body a redemption of the body the fullness of salvation and so in connecting divine healing to that we saw plainly in the word how that the message is trying to elevate our faith and not only how but the why the message is trying to elevate our faith to believe the word only amen that's what brother branham is never dismissive about uh laying on of hands anointing with oil these things that are very scriptural but we do see this theme that brother branham was wanting to establish those things allow god to operate in those things but then use those as kind of building blocks or stepping stones into an elevated faith to where in our maturity we take god at his word and we don't have to revisit some of the elementary things or the fundamental things but built up in these things we come to a place of perfect faith and so divine healing uh is in divine healing and coming to this uh elevated faith we come to this time god meets us time and time again through the uh the repetition of his word and the daily acts of faith where finally we come to the place where even in divine healing we can take god at his word and that's an elevated faith and it's not to say that someone does not have faith in any other area but it's just kind of instructional uh to get us to this place where we can rise up to the level that we ought to be at and i hadn't uh really considered sharing this part at all and so maybe you're just all getting giddy with excitement but i will admit that in the past in in approaching this subject and through the many years of ministry and not very long i'm still considering myself very young in ministry you could take these things i mean that and and you could take these things and present them in a way to where you're really not doing yourself any favors because the critics are immediately going to say oh they're against divine healing they're against laying on of hands they're against prayer lines and and and i realized that some of the things that brother branham says are very instruct or probably more for the minister to consider and to take in consideration and be informed by than necessarily presenting them to the people because there's a way that you could present these things to the people and they go to the extremes oh well we don't believe in altar calls and we don't believe in the gifts and we don't believe in laying on of hands and so really in some ways it's more informative to the man of god and the minister to realize that in what you emphasize and how you take people's faith and you grow it and you build it that you're always conscious and aware that there's an ultimate and so you use things in such a way in the word of god to bring them to a place of an ultimate and and that's kind of what's informing you in the background and so i actually even at one time it kind of purposed in my heart maybe never to deal with these things again over the pulpit but god just over the last couple months just opening things up more and more to me where i realized wow there's just so much more to it where it doesn't need to get into that realm of sides and this this camp and that camp that it really it's a beautiful thing for all of us to be fully aware of that this is what god is doing in my life this is how all these things work together and he's using them to build my faith not kind of just create a little bit of a dynamic that i always live within but to grow me to a place of perfection and so my title today is sign signs everywhere signs and that's my title and it may seem a little bit eye-catchy just that uh that sign there but my kind of my thesis is what i'm wanting to look at and i think this fits in with these other seven parts is now when it comes to the things of god we're wanting to remove the noise and all the distractions so that we kind of catch the signal or follow the signal to the word because the word is the ultimate and there's a lot of things that around the world that create the noise and it could actually be kind of the word that is giving rise to it brother iran said wherever god is there's a lot of noise and we can use those quotes to really drum up a really nice worship service right wherever christ is there's a lot of noise but wouldn't it be a shame if in all the noise you never heard them of all the noise you never got to them you just kind of get caught up in the peripheral enthusiasm of something and even when elijah was in the cave there were signs signs everywhere signs but where was he found he was in that voice and so those when the lord passed by he was known in some of the more visible things but ultimately it was that voice that spoke to his heart so kind of what we're wanting to do and if i can't remember to come back to this to remember today in this title sign signs everywhere signs is what the we mentioned before signs are pointing to something and that with all the with all the noise can i actually follow the signal back to the source and find the through this beacon find where i need to be and so in mark chapter 16 i'm not going to read the whole passage again but we know that jesus gives the great commission and he is telling him to go into all the world and preach the gospel we can almost say just as he outlines it in matthew that that is the commission go into all the world and preach the gospel commanding people everywhere to obey to to follow the things which i have commanded you teaching them to observe all things which i have told you to do and then he says he that believes that is baptized shall be saved he that believes not it shall be damned and so faith is the ultimate not even the baptism uh because if you don't believe and are baptized that doesn't change anything so preaching the word and believing is the ultimate and and then he gives he kind of elicits these signs shall follow them that believe we'll come to that here in a moment but if i could put it this way and these are just my words it's kind of the order of the great commission and this is a commission that the church is still under and they are commissioned to preach christ to the world and so in the way that christ outlines it it's very easy first kind of i think it's very easy for us to identify this that hearing the word is the original way to receive faith because that's the way christ says it in in his introduction preach the word he that believeth shall be saved and then the way he orders it is once the word is preached and there's faith then the signs follow so it kind of catch the order there's a formula the word first faith then signs and and that pattern that has to be the pattern uh the signs don't interrupt that pattern or shouldn't interrupt that pattern and so the signs which follow the believer confirm the word it confirms the very promise and it's confirmation to the doubter to the sinner to the observer to believe the word that was preached in order to be saved so it doesn't become a spin-off where you preach the word and there's faith and then there's signs and then what could happen is people can gravitate to the sign and this is really just laying out the blueprint for the the breadcrumbs for today they can gravitate to the signs but what what what gave rise to the sign let's back up it was the word in faith that produced the signs and there's something tricky about uh human behavior and and about that process to where all now all of a sudden you get you get caught up in the cause and effect and you're you're focusing in on the sign but god gives those signs by his grace to compel the doubter or the sinner or the one who's struggling to come back to the word in order to have faith and so that i think that even if you can kind of imagine that that's really where my mind what i'm wanting to lay out because ultimately uh the believer even and go into all the world preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved that believer does not need signs to believe it says preach the word he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved this is independent apart from any subsequent manifestation of the gifts at all it's manifestation of the spirit preach the word believe and you shall be saved so that believer does not need the signs to believe nor do they need the signs to continue to believe because in a way not in a way but there's absolutely if you turn to ephesians chapter one their faith is sealed and notice how paul outlines this ephesians chapter 1 verses 12 to 14 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ here's the real heart of this in whom ye also trusted christ you trusted after that you heard the word of truth so you trusted you believed you put your confidence in him how did you put your confidence in after you heard the word of truth that's god's program that's god's way the gospel of your salvation and this is really harkens right back to the great commission after you heard the word of truth which is the gospel in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise he that heareth the word and believeth shall be saved he's sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory so paul is going back and following this pattern of the commission you heard the gospel of your salvation which is the word of truth and that is what you believed and then after you believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise and so faith the baptismal holy ghost is a seal of your faith let's let's be very very careful to never misconstrue the message of the hour or the word of god to say that the baptism of the holy ghost is the seal of your discipline the seal of your good works or the seal of your training and or the seal of your understanding it is a seal of your faith and so too he that heareth and believeth is sealed with the holy ghost and then that seal is sure and now you don't need any more signs now in reality you don't need any more signs to be any more saved or any more sealed but still in this world in this flesh there's a way that our minds and even our bodies can kind of signal to us oh i need more i need more but the reality of it is in your soul and what we want to do is never lose contact with that because there's a there's a deity in you at the time that you were sealed wow it's beautiful the deity part not just what i said the deity part inside of you i'm not over here saying nice to my own sermons yeah and brother branham and i'm just going to kind of pepper through the sermon some statements just kind of one-liners that brother brown makes won't necessarily have everything on a slide but i really want you to hopefully just mentally grab a hold of some of these things and not maybe get distracted by the slides but in referring to these signs shall fall them that believe brother branham says mark 16 said these things shall follow them that believe if the church preaches different from that don't you you die to that thing be born again into the word of god so if there's a church that teaches different preachers different from these signs shall fall then that belief he's saying don't you preach that or don't you maybe it's just a fragment but he says you die to that thing and be born again into the word of god indicating that that kind of teaching will actually keep you from being birthed into the word of god because it creates a separate false paradigm that god's not working within and you're constantly seeking the holy ghost constantly seeking the holy ghost and the holy ghost is kind of presented to you as like a carrot being dangled oh you better you you're not going to get the seal until you prove yourself and you're not going to get it till you do this until you do that and you're you're kind of in this uh this a whole nother arena where god's not and he's calling you by grace no come over here to where you can believe all things are possible and saying all right come over here because all you got to do is believe the word and these signs shall follow them that believe but it's amazing how intellectual you can get to say oh no no just the word only and then find yourself in a camp where you don't believe the word can do anything all right it's really remarkable he says you died of that thing brother branham and the sermon ashamed we provided this one now we notice today if somebody says are you a christian it's very much a popular thing to say oh i'm a christian but do you believe the word of god where it said these signs shall follow them that believe oh even ministers faces will blush are you ashamed of say of divine healing are you ashamed of the full gospel are you ashamed of your experience that's being ashamed of his word that his word made flesh in you so the word made flesh in you divine healing the full gospel a pentecostal experience i believe we should understand these in light of how brother branham places them and not in somebody else's the super duper divine healing or some other fantastic that may be out there but these signs shall follow them that believe the full gospel divine healing the pentecostal experience he says if you're ashamed of that you're ashamed of his word that's his word made flashing you so there's there's a lot there's a lot in the message of the hour from 47 all the way believe it or not past the seals through 65 where brother brahms never taking the signs and saying up days of miracles are passed the the apostolic order his uh the apostolic doctrine has ceased and we kind of entered into a different kind of cultish area where we come up with our own ideas no he's kept these things very much alive and well because it was part of god's program to see us to full salvation and so mark chapter 16 verse verse 17 and i think i hope i have uh yeah i have the 18 there i just don't have the slide uh accurately depicted there mark chapter 16 verses 17 and 18. these signs shall follow them that believe them that believe the word and are baptized in jesus name these signs shall follow them what are these signs these are the five signs in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover these are the signs these are five signs that jesus defended definitively says will follow them that believe so these are more when it says they follow think of a more of like kind of the after effects or the the byproduct of kind of the things that are produced from the word and faith they come afterwards and so these things are following the believer and we know we heard it said the believers doesn't follow it but they follow the believer but they're casting out devils in the name of jesus christ they're speaking with new tongues they take up serpents they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now these are the signs that christ said will follow them that believe but looking at it on its face we realize that we have to be very careful to what extent just how far we take these signs and what we use them to be conclusive of because if we say these signs shall fall them that believe they shall take up serpents and then all we've got to do is go out there and grab a snake right or all we'd have and i i had the thought to bring a box and and have something that may seem like a snake and present it to somebody and have it kind of flying out i think you all have heard my snake story so i thought better of that i know what it means to be snake bit but we could kind of produce this self-confirming evidence by just passing out snakes and then if we get bit just saying see you're not going to die right you're doing good everybody's fine and then if we survive the snake bite we've come up with kind of this this evidence by virtue of this sign that see we've got it we're we are the believers that jesus spoke of in mark chapter 16 and we do it by snake handling anybody here from carolina you ever been in a snake handling church they got them they're out there and they really hyper focus on this particular aspect and they've turned this kind of into an evidence because it kind of reads they shall take up deadly serpents and they won't harm them they shall drink deadly things and it won't harm them and so there's a way that carnally you could say well if this is the sign i believe that i'm gonna drink a deadly poison and if i live that shows that i believed or i'm gonna handle these snakes and if i get bitten don't die then that shows i'm a believer so i i think you can look at this and recognize as brother matthew watkins put it there's kind of these ditches that you have to avoid in this in this way and to stay balanced because there's a way that these things can be manipulated or abused brother branham speaking of these signs says we should not seek after them but god gives them and i'm saying a lot of these statements to stay balanced that's his grace he gives them so we shouldn't seek after them but god gives them by his grace he says we go to seeking after them then that's wrong but when he just gives them by his grace that's wonderful in that isn't that a beautiful balance i'm just going to trust god i'm going to believe his word i'm going to die to any idea that tells me that the gifts don't work and there's nothing to this and there's nothing to that but i'm just going to stay focused on his word i'm not going to try to manufacture anything or drum up anything and i'm just going to believe his word and then he says if god gives him that's wonderful and that's still his grace but our mindset is i don't need to look any further than his word and this very real revelation i have of his word to believe these things when i say these things it's christ not necessarily the signs it's kind of the the misnomer that and i remember in the very beginning in the very genesis before uh the website believed the sign was even published i sat down with the the brothers who had the burden in their heart to do it and they spent a lot of time explaining me what they were trying to do and their objective behind it asked me to write for it and be a part of it and their whole idea was that you would believe the sign and their their their desire was to definitively prove without any doubt scientifically historically uh geographically and everything else the truth of the message right and so it just in its genesis it was just a little bit off-kilter so then and really i say this with respect you should it should help us to understand why someone who's who's driven by that would come to a place a little bit of disenchantment and kind of become come to a place of doubting when it comes to the message of the hour because they set out to do something you can't do and they wanted to definitively do something that god's never asked us necessarily to do to just kind of worship and believe the sign it's to believe the word and so i i'm in some ways i'm sympathetic to their plight because i realize it was wrong and it's beginning and that's why they find themselves where they are now god have mercy on them i i think if i could even say this there's a lot of insincerity associated with it many times a lot of intentional personal baggage and vendettas but be very careful in your attitude towards people who doubt who don't believe who who are even very critical uh many times if you if you take a look at what they've gone through you could realize why they've ended up where they were and i just say god have mercy on them and they're actually good people wonderful people that you would enjoy fellowshipping with that have found themselves very hurt or uh kind of discombobulated when it comes to certain things about the message did we edit that out is that is that still in so brother brad is saying that we should not seek after the signs so we do not seek signs because if we seek signs it places the signs ahead of the word and and and in doing so kind of upsets god's god's order we go back to the great commission in god's order if we start seeking the signs brother man says they're wonderful when god gives them so when we see the signs we're not like right we don't like oh there's nothing to that we wonderful god gives them isn't that wonderful but we don't start chasing after them and seeking them we just kind of rest and we say this is wonderful this is great however god uses them we receive them and we are blessed by them we revert our focus back to the word and we don't seek the signs because then if you seek the signs it's the signs that get ahead of you and have the preeminence instead of the word coming first and faith being birthed by that and that will never get you to redemption it's never going to grow your faith it'll actually disappoint your faith brother braham says remember he said that this is just referring to mark chapter 16 these signs shall fall in the belief remember he said that that has to be he would not have said that unless there was going to be somebody who could catch that word so it's in the word he said it and he would not have said it if there wasn't somebody who is going to uh be able to catch the word by virtue of those things so we don't and again i'm trying to stay very very balanced especially in the outset so that we don't we don't deviate from this course that these are god-given things and seeking after signs may lead to signs just as you mentioned kind of the self-confirming self-fulfilling prophecy i prophesy that i'm in a i'm going to slap chase right guess who's listening now i could prophesy that right and it would be really easy for it to come to pass and say bless god i'm a prophet right this is kind of self-fulfilling so seeking after signs may lead to more signs but it won't necessarily lead to more faith because this is where i referred to it and i didn't necessarily like the specific language of it because maybe from an academic or scientific even a business standpoint there's maybe more to it and it may be very easy for people to get very quickly into the weeds but i referred to as a feed that feedback loop and a feedback loop i was kind of just thinking where there's an output that just keeps it just the out it just keeps circling around and it just generates maybe more of an audio loop would be what we'd be thinking of to where it just generates this buzz or this sound where it's like is that what it even was to begin with and so i think this may be a good spot to use this first slide um and i'll try maybe to use this this is very rudimentary and i know some of you graphic designers are scoffing at this and no it wasn't like a take on the amazon logo i just realized that kind of after the fact and um uh thank you jeff for the uh permission to use your logo i i don't know if he streams but if he streams he's not tithing i can tell you that much but what ought to be this is the order i'm speaking to you brother bezos this is the original formula the word and i'm kind of looping pointing to faith and when the word has given rise to faith faith looks back to the word faith cometh by hearing the word of god so the word first faith is gen born and then faith knows whose its daddy is so it looks right back to the word like this is what faith this word comes faith faith always goes back to the word because that's what it's based on it's the only thing it'll feed it you could draw this out within the the temple of the body we have the soul and then there is the sense to those who are born again is the sense of faith it's the sixth sense it's the only thing that resides there the only thing that can reach that is the word and so when that comes in what is it that comes comes back out what's to come but come back out to him be protected to the word so faith has to be something that's directed towards it comes back to the word now kind of the offshoot of that are signs in this dynamic of the word faith and this kind of this dynamo i reached out to brother lucas yesterday because he he has a gift of of taking things and presenting things visually and even taking maybe complex thoughts and processes uh and he does a lot of teaching in his professional life and so i kind of just called him up to kind of spit ball and that was kind of maybe the way he even described it when i first mentioned it to him it's kind of like this dynamo that one just works against the other you think about that creates an energy right this this these forces working it gets going and it's never going to stop this eternal dynamo and kind of what's going to radiate from that are signs but where the power is is in the word faith dynamic what the byproduct is are signs right kind of like what they do is they um they're trying to produce these nuclear plants their goal is to produce waste and the byproduct is energy see what i did there and uh thank you and so this is the word this is that this is the dynamic and then signs follow signs follow but the real heart of it is in this word and faith relationship and so that would be god's formula that would be god's original desire there'll be all the things we've said through these several parts is that faith comes by the word that is what faith looks back to and the signs are the byproduct not the objective so word comes to faith faith then produces these signs and then and the the dynamic present then faith now isn't looking looking to the signs or is not toward the sign nothing nothing in this whole formula changes and so in that the signs are not the objective your faith is the objective of the word right this is signs come by hearing hearing by the word of god it's not the signs but faith does now in this other formula i think i kind of thought of in my mind kind of is the deceptive formula or the bezos formula is the the idea that you have over in this one side if you can see the in in the left-hand corner of that dynamic word faith word faith what is it going to spin off it's going to spin off signs but a whole nother dynamo starts or something kind of spins off of that dynamic because they're signs and that produces this loop of signs point to signs point back to signs point to signs point back to signs and it just gets going and it gets its own momentum and that can happen independent of this this other dynamic of the word in faith and the way that brother lucas had drawn it out is on the inside there is the word faith and then there's this outer ring of signs and and that that you could actually have the outer ring of signs but never have the inner ring of word and faith because all we'd have to do is pass out snakes every sunday think of how packed we'd be not hardly but you'd have the signs right and look how powerful we are signs point to signs point to signs and then you need it every service right we this is where brother branham says you can't can't hardly have a meeting without divine healing right is because that's what you look to and it's not really faith anymore because faith is starving just give me the word just give me the word but it's that sign part feeding back into signs feeding back into signs and so in this it's very easy for you to visually see this where's the problem is it's bypass the word and since it's bypassed the word it can't produce faith it just points to itself and it becomes circular reasoning how do you know your sign is right because it produced it produces signs well how do you know your signs are right because it produces signs signs and this is where using the example of the an audio feedback and i don't have a chart for this but i think this can just kind of signify it for you know you can keep that up there bill john is in this you have an audio feedback is there signal and i don't know that i want to produce it because it can be very grating and irritating but how many have ever heard audio feedback right here in this church bless god a signal my voice or a voice is basically because a signal to a microphone which is then amplified and sent through a speaker right that's how it should be there's there's some signal even if there's no voice that the microphone is going to be sending the signal to which is amplified and then pushed out through speakers i should i could just do this here pushed out through speakers or a speaker and then what happens is when that comes out of the speaker and the microphone picks it back up it creates a loop you ever ever looked at a mirror in a mirror right and it creates that image it's very fascinating the younger you are and it creates that image and and that's kind of like a feedback loop it's it's mirroring a mirror mirror mirror it seems like it goes on forever so what happens is when this signal is amplified and pushed out to the speaker and then it comes back to the same as the input it was the output you're hearing me was the output now it becomes the input and that's where it begins to get to the point where it's uh and it doesn't mean anything anymore it can sound really good in some types of music if you like that but you've got to be able to use it correctly right and so in this way it's not desirable at all because think about it you can get that loop without any voice that's right and what happens is the voice can speak it gets amplified sent out through the speaker and without ever speaking again it gets right back into the channel and that becomes the source and it just creates its own dynamo and you get to wear have you ever done it played it with your phones you call someone on another phone there in the room with you and you go hello hello hello hello and it starts going that's the feedback loop you can't hear hello anymore the original voice the original spoken word it's lost but it's there's this feedback that keeps going through and it's all by a signal now that's exactly what a sign is a sign in the bible even this word that's used here in uh in mark chapter 16 sign is translated to miracle wonder or even token and in that way we could think of a signed post or something that brother ran talks about the sign to jeffersonville and these are the definitions of a sign a mark or a token that by which a person or a thing is distinguished from others and known so here's a sign this is a signal this is signification it's distinctive something distinctive a distinctive mark that differentiates a person or thing from others and by which it's made known kind of like when cain said oh no they're going to kill me and god says well i'll put a sign i'll put a mark on you that people will know not to touch you and so that's what a sign is it also is an unusual occurrence that transcends the common course of nature this is what is meant in the word of god i will send signs and lo there'll be signs and there'll be these different signs and so it's something that kind of is a sign gets your attention because like whoa that doesn't normally happen right this is and it's to it signifies something it's an unused sign could be an unusual occurrence so let me say this by definition just any unusual occurrence will be a sign but is it signifying anything in the bible signs can be used as and there's just a lot of we could use in the message of the hour in the bible just showing that a sign can just be as uh jeffersonville five miles just something that's uh showing you that something's coming the flashing red lights of his signs of his coming the signs of the end time this shall be a sign of the end those are things then that happen that are not necessarily pointing back or anything present but telling you something is coming so there's different there's a lot of different ways that sign can be used and i realized that in the outset but was easily got could get lost in just the dynamic of the signs but it comes from the word to signify or to indicate which is it's a signal a sign gives a signal and so if that sign is signaling and that's that's some sort of output to kind of point you back to something if it feeds back into itself that's that's what we're looking at in this slide now are we all together in the same page all right good so in matthew chapter 12 verses 38 to 42. we're gonna just we're gonna launch off into a um we took a lot of time on that uh we're gonna launch off into some of the scriptures that treat these signs then certain of the scribes and pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said to them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign hold that phrase in mind and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas so the sign there is going to be a resurrection sign it's under the resurrected messiah there's gonna be something happen first jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be three days and nights in the heart of the earth now that he's saying there shall be i can put there's no other sign given you know this is uh it will touch on it here in just a moment they had received signs so he's not saying up you haven't received any signs he's saying now the only other sign you should look for and the other sign there's going to be is this sign of the resurrection which is christ the son of man is going to resurrect in three days and then he said that so you're seeking a sign there will be no other sign given except the resurrection and then recognize how he amplifies this sign or their attitude towards him show us a sign come on come on show me a sign so we can believe the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn that generation the sign seeking generation because they the name of a generation repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here notice christ language he doesn't say they recognize the sign of the one who smelt like fish or recognize the sign of the one who demonstrated certain no he says they repented at the preaching jonah shows up in nineveh saying repent and they're like okay and general's like ah right but that generation is going to raise up because apart from any signs and wonders and miracles jonah's the one that had them for himself to vindicate the message to go there and preach and have that liberty to preach he didn't need to put up a chart and i want to show you what the inside of a specially prepared fish looks like and could anybody show you this unless they had been there smell me you know right i came out of the it's and really the story of jonah is remarkable when you think about where he would have been swallowed and where he probably would have been burped up on land and really scripture just how long he would have traveled if you just take it literally to get to nineveh and yet when he gets there the word is what he uses and that's what the people repent at and so he's using the people of nineveh who merely repented at the word as being those who would judge the generation receiving the messiah wanting more than the word verse 42 the queen of the south shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to see solomon's wealth to see his gift of discernment to enjoy his signs to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold the greater than jonas is here and behold a greater than solomon is here [Music] he came from the she came to hear the wisdom of solomon the people of nineveh heard the preaching notice what the woman was seeking the queen of sheba what she was seeking the wisdom of solomon which is the word the wisdom that would be imparted that's what she sought what was it that the men of nineveh received the word and that's what brought forth their repentance so christ is actually being very direct in this passage about those that seek signs and what the ultimate is and why those generations will condemn the sign seeking generation because they took god at his word and that queen of the south is the queen of sheba the queen of seven she really represents this bride who raises up out of the seventh church age takes god at his word even considered to be a mythological character historically and geologically they can find no record of her they can't figure out where she came from it seems as if she has no father no mother no beginning of days nor ending of life it's a queen to king melchizedek seeketh when jesus says this generation even adulterous generation seeketh after a sign it implies the very word that is used implies they seek more the seeking is they're seeking more or above and beyond what they had had already so it's not that they're a sign less generation or they haven't seen anything but the language he uses this an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign they want more than what they've already given that's what makes them this evil and adulterous generation is they have received but they still want more and jesus had already demonstrated a scriptural sign that he was the messiah already demonstrated it and that's why nathanael says i believe right he there was something that was demonstrated there's people that believed is this not the very messiah there were those that were believing and what it did on the one it didn't do on the other but now the jews sought more signs from christ because they weren't satisfied with the scriptural sign that was given it's like oh no we want more this is the uber generation this is the more generation this is the plus generation we want a subscription to these kind of signs and we want it delivered every sunday on time and we want to save a little bit if we subscribe that's what they were wanting they saw the signs over christmas now brother brad i'm again i'm going to say i'm reading this statement to be balanced but notice what he what's kind of in this give and take and the fundamental foundation for faith he says we don't have to have signs now remember weak and adulterous generation seeks after signs but friend we've been so educated two are educated away from the supernatural see that slippery slope right where all of a sudden you start you get you you tilt it certain way all of a sudden you just gonna stop believing you tilt it another way and then you can't believe without a sign it says we're educated away from the supernatural that's right jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe we are never seeking signs but god is always there with signs from the very beginning in genesis to revelation in the bible run of the church said it was constantly signs and there was and when there was no signs there was no god so brother when he touches on this particular scripture in several instances he emphasizes how the jews were not wrong to seek a sign they were told to seek assign but they missed the sign that they were told to look for they missed the scriptural sign that was given pointing him back to the word the prophet spoke here came the fulfillment of that prophecy a sign was being manifested and what ought to that sign done putting them right back to the word that was given so they could believe in him whom he hath sent god had sent and that that's what ought to have been happening and that's what happened to the believers so it happened to some of the disciples that say some because we know judas he he walked in all these other things but when it came to the word he couldn't go into that so they missed the sign so there's been a number of statements we've read but now that would be pro-sign if i could say god sends him it's his grace we believe in him we're never seeking after but god is always there with signs where there are no signs there is no god right so well if i want to find god i've got to look for signs i've got to look for signs no no no i got to be careful you've got to be very very careful so this is how we arrive at our conundrum this is where it gets to that paradox the signs follow but there's got to be caution the signs follow but you have to be careful that you're not you're not you're not getting the order reversed in luke chapter 11 when christ this same instance is mentioned in luke chapter 11 verses 27 to 29 notice how again the word becomes the focus and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bear thee and the paps which thou has sucked now this is notice the response to want to worship the mother blessed is the woman well here's a here's demonstrative signs being given she's not saying this because jesus was good-looking she's saying this because of the demonstrative signs and the things that he was teaching but notice how through that something is gets a little bit out of out of skew where now she wants to worship mary and the blessing is to go to the mother right and so in that way you have to realize something is very body spirit to that and not soul because their attention's drawn more to oh the woman that gave birth blessed is she but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it amen right in other words let's let's get it out of the physical and get it out of the emotional and get right to the heart of the matter the blessing is those that hear the word and keep it and that what in the remark that he made to thomas thomas wanted to feel he was doubting we call them doubting thomas and jesus said blessed are they that believe and have not seen this is the more blessed this is the higher way this is the elevated way this is the ultimate i would that you would take me at my word i would that in reading the word of god or hearing the word of god there's an energy given to you called faith and revelation and when you see it by faith and by revelation yes that's my absolute right so he says yay blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it and then immediately it says and when they were gathered thick together he began to say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall be no sign given it but the sign of jonas the prophet jesus emphasizes believing the word over believing the sign or he emphasizes believing the word over the sign notice the fanaticism that surrounds it to point to the flesh of mary which would then in turn be responsible in their mind right the responsible for the flesh of christ and that's the cycle they're in oh blessed is this woman because she gave birth to him so she has some causal connection and these are this is what it's related brother branham says in scriptural signs of the time i need to move on jesus here was rebuking that generation because they had not believed his scriptural sign right that's what brother brahm often visits in this he rebuked them because they had not believed a scriptural sign so catch this it was not a rebuke of signs period it was not a rebuke for them believing because of a sign it was not a rebuke for them to be expecting signs it was not because we could say well i believe and so i expect signs to follow and we turn that into something wrong no we believe and that signs will follow so there ought to be some expectation because where god is there's going to be signs but that can't tip into sign seeking so he says i'm not rebuking that generation because they were seeking a sign alone but because they had not believed the sign that had already been given so he says watch these pharisees they come to him and said master we would seek a sign from thee watch the blindness of them what is the blindness related to the sign had already been done and they didn't recognize it so could we could we be guilty of the same in some sort of uh by analogy in our own lives when god gives us the sign and that ought to revert us back to the word in order to have faith but we're still fleecing we're still searching we're still trying to find a feather and build a chicken while we pray for it he says the sign had already been done and they didn't recognize it and this is why i wanted to read this whole statement do you know i believe that one day the rapture will take place and people know nothing about it now i'm thinking real spiritual about this in light of what we ministered last time he's saying that christ was rebuking them for missing the sign that had already been given and they failed to recognize it and brother bannon makes this jump this is right in that same season april of 1964 we read from we referenced a lot of those sermons from tampa that's going to take place later this week he's saying do you know i believe that one day the rapture will take place and people know nothing about it now he didn't change the subject he's given us another another signal to say just as christ was present then and it demonstrated a sign and the next thing that was going to happen was a resurrection god had given if this is if i'm not mistaken this may be very near where he's preaching in birmingham alabama and he says abraham seed receive your last sign the sign had been given if we collectively as a bride are looking for a sign to ignite rapturing faith if we're looking for some signification to happen among certain group of ministers or in special meetings or something demonstrated to happen a gift of discernment or powerful healings if that's what we're looking for in order to be an expectation of the change of our body we are just as guilty of those in matthew chapter 12 and luke chapter 11 by god having already given us a vindicated sign and a voice following and now we're all hungry seeking after signs that's not going to get us to rapturing faith it might get you healed because even brother branham says in a very uh difficult statement to kind of understand sometimes is if intellectual faith will get healed so he's saying it right in connection with the rapture so to me that orients me again it catches me again i had several scriptures here one two three four five scriptures i was going to read very quickly but in mark chapter 8 matthew chapter 16 luke chapter 11 earlier than this reference john chapter 2 john chapter 6 the pharisees came seeking of him a sign tempting him matthew 6 tempting him tempting him why were they why was it a temptation because they're trying to draw him astray from god's pattern why was it a temptation to show a sign it wasn't so much that christ would sin but a temptum tempted him to demonstrate something that would place the wrong emphasis the temptation was to now get the order reversed because christ is demonstrating what pattern whatever the father says he does whatever his father speaks he speaks now there's a different there's a different force trying to push him in to do signs for the sake of the people and that would interrupt god's pattern so the pharisees come to seeking a sign then it says the sadducees with the pharisees tempting him desiring that he would show them a sign and then in luke 11 others tempting him sought a sign from heaven in john the jews say what signs show us that one to us so it's the pharisees the sadducees the the the others the jews show us a sign john 6 that great passage that we've been studying a lot from what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe now catch the nature now of the people because this is what jesus is dealing with he's the divine one who's bypassed uh sinful nature so he doesn't have the proclivity to just oh science yeah this sounds great this is wonderful let's do signs he doesn't have that instinct he doesn't have that he can't give in to that temptation he's being tempted but he doesn't have that itch to show off he doesn't have that need to prove himself he doesn't have that need to say well i'm just kind of unsure of my ministry and if i could just get people to raise their hand and if i could just get people at the altar and if i could just he doesn't have to do that he doesn't feel that need he's he's comfortable in his calling he has a revelation of who he is so what we have to recognize christ if i could say being immune to that being tempted but having the character having that gift to resist it it creates the contrast to the people who are now demonstrating let's just be honest we right he's demonstrating humans that's exactly what he's doing is he's showing off they're showing what how we are and it's the nature of people to push it to more to more to more right so some of the attitude people have in taking medicine right if they say take two four is better shouldn't laugh so loud you've been found out or at least your spouse has and that's kind of the attitude people take you know the i i there's there's a joke maybe where if the if the turn the corner says 60 miles an hour on the turn it means you can double it right 30 miles in turn means you can go safely go 60. that's just the way some people think uh whatever it is just double it and that's kind of the nature more more more more that's why we are right now already planning on trading in our iphone 13 pro max for an iphone 14 pro maxer right because we want more and so the nature of the people is more what we've had is really not enough we want more more and so what is it sine sine sine sine sine and christ resists resisted the urge to make the gift and and that's a whole other dynamic is a gift that someone can have but he resisted the urge to make the signs the emphasis he didn't want the signs to become the attraction right if there's a great big marquee then that's the sign but what is the attraction what's inside john was the sign christ was the attraction jesus did not want the signs to become the attraction he was the word he was the attraction and not only do this did he do this when they were thick together but he also did it when he was just alone with satan being tempted in the wilderness who tried to make the fantastic and the visible and the flesh the preeminence and he said no i got to stay with the word i got to stay with the word and brother branham and i've read this before but i want to read this just to kind of emphasize again the nature of the people to push this god keeps his word but there is a supernatural that's been done so in the sermon god keeps his word there's a supernatural that's been done that's true but you're going wild with it you're going on the deep end with it the devil's pushing you off with it you've got plumb out of the bible now this is him whatever the circumstance may be i'm not trying to debate the actual specifics some people may say well brother aaron if you recognize he preached this in such and such church and the pastor there was doing this and doing that and get all historical and get try to add so much context to it that we kind of basically isolated it and just kind of punted it so it's not of any uh use to us but let's just kind of take it in what's in the if we can kind of look at it in its pattern brother brown is saying there's a way that you can take the supernatural that's been done and you can go wild with it so it's an outlier it only happened once well it can happen and go wild with it go off the deep end with it why because the devil's trying to push you to go all in on the signs go all in on the quote-unquote supernatural and you get into the super-duper divine heal and they make a mockery out of a gift they make a mockery out of a dynamic they make a mockery of the brother and so they make an idol out of laying out of hens he says i believe in the supernatural i believe in jesus christ i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and does the same things that he did yesterday and will forever we believe in the supernatural we believe god placed gifts in the church we believe these signs shall fall them that believe but there must be a balance not for balance sake but for momentum and for progress remember there's several services that kind of built on movement and maturity and progress and having an elevated faith but the human tendency is to become a fanatic now i want to use peter as an example of all of us peter's nature is our all of our natures and in john chapter 13 verses 6 to 10 then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord does thou wash my feet and jesus said what i do is not now but thou you don't know what i do now but you will know hereafter and so peter says thou shalt never wash my feet in verse eight this is peter right it's basically are you gonna wash my feet yes and you don't understand what i'm doing but you will later well you're not going to touch my feet and jesus says well if i don't wash you you won't have any part with me lord wash all of me right not my feet only but my hands and my head this is peter i don't need any i want it all i want to be soaking i want to be dripping with pour it on me jesus it was like chill out i'm just trying to wash your feet one minute no washi at all next minute you want me to dunk you and this is what this is his just how dramatic he is and he says simon peter said lord not my feet only jesus says verse 10 he that is washed need to thought save to wash his feet but it's clean everywhere and you're clean but not at all in other words hey just do what i say let me just wash your feet like one minute you're just so reluctant it kind of shows the extremes right there's just there's a peter on one side there's a peter there's like the peter in this ditch and a peter at that ditch and they're both kind of shooting at the guy in the middle drawing their sword against the guy in the middle why because one doesn't want to have any of it the other one wants nothing but that this is peter matthew chapter 17 verses 3 and 5. here he is on mount transfiguration and a tremendous it's just really not even a sign in the sense of something uh indicating something later but an unusual occurrence that something transcends common course of nature takes place and they behold moses and elijah talking with christ that's amazing right i mean that just kind of i know that was a really poor way of describing mount transfiguration that is just right this is this is so supernatural and there's a recognition that peter has right this is where you realize this is something like who are these strange guys talking to jesus they know this is moses they know this is elijah if you really just meditated on it or pondered maybe the uh what's taking place on mount transfiguration this is so extraordinary this is a mount transfiguration experience this is the adoption of christ they are witnesses too brother i said the rehearsal of is coming this is this is so amazing and peter's catching it and peter's seeing it and peter's response is oh oh let's build a church let's build three of them one for moses one for elijah and one for christ and we can go to one on wednesday and one on saturday and one on sunday and we can belong to three churches because you know god's perfecting threes it's like a joke they saw the guy on an island and they rescued him and as they're leaving there was three buildings they said what are those three buildings well that one there's my house so what's that other one so that's my church and i said what's the other one says oh that's the church i used to go to i didn't like it anymore look what he says here verse 3 lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elijah and as soon as he says it what does god speak from the cloud this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased hear ye him only it doesn't matter how much signs i gave moses it doesn't matter how much signs i gave elijah it doesn't matter how vindicated they were doesn't matter what types they hold and what they prophesied they pointed to christ hear him alone you don't build a religion you don't build a system you don't build a church to the prophets it's the christ but the nature of peter was to elevate the man brother bradham says and as i was with moses so will i be with thee i just want to take a short detour very very very quickly just to refer to how brother branham was talking about the sign that he was given and it was the gifts whether to take someone by the hand or the gift of discernment and that's as i was with moses moses demonstrated those tremendous gifts or had these tremendous signs that were given to him and so brother branham is in this sermon he's talking about the commission and the laying on of hands and just praying for the sick that's the commission and the sign he's talking about aren't necessarily the five signs associated with the great commission but a gift that he had personally which was a sign and what take what took place in brother branham's ministry where he's saying i've been wrong and we've done this wrong and we've gone too much after the sign and we're looking too much to the sign and we're waiting for someone to do a sign he's really looking at the dynamic of a gift where you can pull on the gift and you can pull someone into prophesying you could pull someone into doing this and you can use it that way brother ramon even talks about how when you use the gift it wears down the person and it wears them out and and they're drained he says but when god uses it right so whenever you see whenever a minister preaches his heart out and whatever whenever there's maybe he's praying for the sick and he's completely exhausted brother i'm saying well that's because people were pulling on that gift but when god uses it he said it was something different so now this pattern that pattern can exist today without that kind of dynamic gif that kind of prophetic gift he says but all pentecostal people like signs the pentecostal people like science it's kind of what's associated with the pentecostal people they like to see it the bible said a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after signs but the commission was prayed for the sick he just goes back to the commission and tens of thousands of times thousands i have failed to pray for because they all desired the sign that amazing because everyone wanted to see something and they wanted something demonstrated whereas he could have prayed for thousands tens of thousands times thousands so really it's kind of like whatever thousands you want to go to that he could have prayed for and he didn't because they all he says they all desire it they desired a sign what was it they wanted the gift of discernment they wanted the gift of him telling you what's wrong with you they wanted the gift to be demonstrated even if they're just a spectator one or they're in the audience lord just let them call on me lord just let them call on me lord just let them call on me and brother branham that's a true gift it was a true sign right it was this was something this is even the sign of the messiah but what did the jews want more give us more it was like it was never enough it was how many times did he need to do it how often did he have to demonstrate it and so it it flipped into that wrong feedback loop where now it was just all about the sign and let me be very careful on how i articulate this be very aware be very careful how that many times what gets the headline is that kind of gift what gets the headline is when god and i'm being very clear about this when god uses that type of gift and not to that level of brother branham but in another way oh lord if if you want me to do this or lord if i'm going to receive my healing have brother aaron just just talk today about tendinitis or let him talk about corporal tunnel syndrome lord please i want to be healed in my corporal tunnel syndrome just let brother aaron bring it up and if he could just bring it up may he mention the left hand and may he specifically talk about tennis elbow and if he can do that lord just please if he can do that and i know i'm gonna be healed god's love for you will actually cause me just all of a sudden use a hypothetical about corporal tunnel syndrome and tennis elbow on the left hand just so you can believe and you know what that gets the headlines right we tell the testimony next wednesday i was praying that god would do this and brother aaron got up there and he just said this that and the other exactly what i needed i prayed for this sign i prayed to this fleece and this is exactly what happened and everyone's listening okay what did you do you prayed for that sign god gave you the sign and you got healed okay let me try that and there's a person sitting over there going huh i just took god at his word at the beginning of service when he said whatever you have need of just lift your hand and you raise that left hand and say lord i believe for the healing of my arm and all this thing and guess what that's that testimony don't get told it's the other one that does why because those though i mean they don't they didn't create readers digest and guidepost right for that kind of faith it's the whoa that is crazy that is amazing that is a miracle that's usually what gets the headlines right so and so did this and so and so did that the gift and i took a whole portion of my notes just kind of cut them completely out where brother i'm going down that line of tommy osborne and oral roberts and all these gifts that get the preeminence and have the prims and what it becomes and the fanaticism and how luther was the remarkable thing about his ministry is he lifted his head above the fanaticism was it's lifting your head above the noise in the wrong feedback loop the echo chamber lifting your head above that matthew chapter 7 verses 21-23 wherefore by their fruit you shall know them this is another remarkable instance about signs and fruits signification the fruit signifies the life of the tree wherefore by the fruits you shall know them brother said that even with respect to the fruits of the spirit and galatians brother bram said the devil can impersonate every single one of them wherefore by their fruit you shall know them okay so i'm a fruit inspector i'm looking for fruits but then watch this it's almost like a complete all right all right and then all of a sudden but he says not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter in the kingdom of heaven so you're like well it's just not the fruit of lord lord but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven now what was the great commission what are the five signs they shall cast out devils in my name they shall lay hands on the sick take up deadly surface drink any deadly thing and and and speak with new tongues these are the five signs so these are we would say these are the signs that follow them that believe we're kind of looking for these things and he says he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many shall say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils in a night name done many wonderful works could it not be that he's already foreshadowing what the signs of the great commission would be lord lord this is not yo yo this isn't papa this is lord lord this is a sign of reverence this is a seems to be a sign of understanding we've prophesied in your name we cast out devils in your name we did many wonderful works in your name we are bearing the name of christian we are used in the name of jesus christ and then i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity these are workers of iniquity for the man places and therefore in the cast of reprobates heathen like the wicked but yet here they are professing christianity brother braham said jesus does not deny that they did mighty works that only the holy ghost can accomplish by way of men didn't deny that but he did deny ever knowing them and he said they weren't backsliders is this doesn't that kind of create this real scary form of godliness has all the look and all the feel and all the representation but inside is missing word faith word faith word faith but on the outside there's a lot of activity but having the form of god's but denying the power of revelation which can only come by the word which can which boosts his faith but in another place says you can't claim the manifestation is the evidence of being spirit born or spirit-filled what are these what are these works manifestations fruits of the spirit gifts signs are manifestations of the spirit but he says you can't claim it as an evidence of being spirit-filled no sir i will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit doing mighty acts you realize then how we have to divide this and how we have to separate it we have to recognize that where there is a manifestation of the spirit according to the word we don't speak against that we said that's the holy spirit doing mighty acts to the extent that one is wanting to use it to point to something other than the word then we say ah you've gone too far right that's where we don't we don't have to throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak we say oh no i believe god i believe god healed them i believe you raised them from the dead but that doesn't mean you're my prophet that doesn't mean you're my god that can only come by faith by the word so so it's not a it's a true manifestation he admits a manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations by your fruit by their fruits you shall know them it takes it more than just kind of the outside when i was reading this last i guess looking at it and recognizing that there is a uh jesus is kind of calling out the first virtue signalers right they were virtue signaling in that they were talking about all their works to make it look look how good they are how virtuous they are trying to demonstrate their correctness and their righteousness by what they did but what was it it's the wrong signal because their signal loop their signs loop right back into themselves and used as the defense i cast out devils in your name we did this and it vindicated themselves not christ there's no reliance on his grace there's no but lord you said if i believed you would receive me it steps in this whole another realm we were signed to sign to sign to sign to sign a sign design how could you discount this and he said i i don't i don't know you you're you're in your own other round pen here you're doing you're not in the dynamo so they do many wonderful works and as we read in matthew chapter 24 verse 24 there shall rise false christ false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect what was a sign an unusual occurrence something distinguishing a wonder is something exceptional something impressive they shall show great signs and wonders and he calls them false christ what is a false christ a genuine holy spirit anointing but upon a false person so the anointing is true but the person is false the teaching is false what follows is false but i said christ means the anointed ones falsely anointed they are anointed but they are false at the bottom of it and do great signs and wonders speak in tongues dance in the spirit preach the gospel now what we're i think what we're arriving to very late and i apologize in that regards and i recognize it's starting to get a little hot in here that this is where now once we've taken the signs and we seem to have placed them in a place we realized we have to accept these we receive these they follow the believer they follow the believer but now in a way we're we're shifting that from that first slide we're now looking how the second slide can develop where the sign now there's a whole other group of people that can seem to have the signs well these signs shall follow them that believe so that we should just have this comfort level are they snake handling are they speaking in new tongues are they baptizing in jesus name like okay then they're they're the believers but then all of a sudden it's like well you know what just anybody who wants to can or this is possible without having faith they do great signs and wonders speak in tongues dance in the spirit preach the gospel in second timothy chapter 3 verse 8 paul tells timothy that his genesis and jamborees withstood moses these are the names commonly given to the egyptian magicians who resisted moses and if we had time we could go in the scripture how did they resist moses by impersonating moses they didn't resist them by saying well that's impossible that you're you're you know that's you know that's not how i mean you just close your eyes ignore it there's nothing to it no they're just like what a cheap trick we can do it too and they impersonated the sign they impersonated the gift they could kind of do the same thing these magicians impersonating a vindicated prophet sign and so they resisted the truth by impersonating the sign of the truth so keep that in mind the resistance to truth isn't so much an outright rejection of it but a reassembling of the signs as a way of protecting you and keeping you from truth a sign originally is given to loop you back to the word so someone fabricates a a sign and impersonates a sign so that what you go to sign to sign to sign because it's not pointing back to the word i have to go very very quickly here and he says they reprobate concerning the faith why because it's signs being impersonated not the word producing faith producing a sign pointing back to the word to repeat the cycle again or as an off spin-off of that dynamo it's become an impersonation with the intent to deceive bill abraham said satan can impersonate any gift he says the devil can impersonate any of those things talking about speaking in tongues casting out devils doing those things and preaching when he talks about this as far as an impersonation he means he these things can happen but it'd be a false anointing he even says look the divine the beatles are now going to impersonate divine healing filthy dirty rotten born out of hell so paul telling timothy in the last days second timothy 3 talks about in the last days satan is going to exhibit the same lying wonders signs miracles and wonders think very very personal now i think very very close to home because remember the the the deception and even the betrayal is from within very very close brothers in the same church that false manifestation is not we're not all worried about all of a sudden the pope having a prayer line at the vatican right we say we'd be like about time right but that's what he does all the time right kiss the ring get me give you the blessing now that the whole the whole how close it gets and can be deceiving is it comes really close to home because all the signs and wonders are create the wrong kind of feedback loop in order to distract you and lead you astray it's exactly what revelations 13 14 says that the he deceiveth them that dwell from the earth by the means of those miracles signs wonders miracles manifestations misused and then misunderstood to draw people away from the truth that's the wrong emphasis i've run out of time but in second thessalonians i say run out of time but you all are so familiar with that phrase like that just doesn't mean anything it just means we're clearly in the after hour but i i can't i'm not going to read all the scripture but in second thessalonians chapter 2 what does it speak of the antichrist working with signs and lying wonders that deceives people and why are they deceived because they have a taste for signs and not a love for the truth if they didn't have if that wasn't what they were seeking if that was is it what they were conditioned for if that wasn't what they were looking for then maybe the signs don't have the impact it's not in their dna it's not in their history it's not in their love it's not in their want they've already been quick into the fact that god operates by his word but the rest of them are left to where their more itchy ears and the sensational and signs and wonders and he demonstrates them and they lie to them and it says that they receive not a love of the truth that they might be saved that's that last verse part of verse 10 there they did not have a love of the truth that they might be saved signs won't save you signs won't even heal you it has to be a love of the truth that you might be saved because the word preached is what instigates faith to be saved and these people entered into entirely different dynamic and boy was it dynamic but it deceived them and god gives them over to a strong delusion because their system promoted the sign and since it promoted the sign it becomes their delusion brother abraham says and works his faith expressed but we want to find a way now i bring this back to divine healings we try to wrap this up what takes place the real basic of divine healing now gift just like i said last night a gift is wonderful but you can't base your eternal destination on gifts you cannot major on a minor and a gift is a minor and satan can impersonate any gift god's got he can make something just exactly like it see exactly therefore we got to watch out and i believe that maybe at least on the most basic level we can say that satan can appear right because we know satan cannot actually heal so in this way there is a an appearance of things that aren't real it says therefore we got to watch that like sometimes i express about shouting i've seen demons shout speak in tongues i've seen demons speak in tongues sure he impersonates it it isn't genuine but it impersonates it makes it look like it's real and people sometimes who don't know the difference declare to be real when it isn't real and the same thing they do about divine healing so you recognize how he just amplifies says better what i was trying to say he does the same thing about divine healing and this is where if we've looked at all these examples of divine healing to try to derive some sort of faith for the moment when we're sick and we're looking at oh well this one sister what she did is she asked that the brother would just preach on this rare disease or she just asked that they would actually call a prayer line and all whatever god did to meet that daughter and her need praise god hallelujah whatever whatever way that gideon wants to fleece the lord and god confirm whatever he's already said that's between them too but we have to be careful that it doesn't establish a pattern for our faith or the faith of god's elect or the way that the church operates or even just how that you will operate and he's saying the same thing with divine healing and this to me it kind of puts in this place i'm not trying to make you reluctant i'm not trying to make you suspicious but what it ought to do is put the real highlighter underlying bold and lights around the word as the ultimate and realize that the word will manifest what brings gifts the word brings signs it's the word that does all these things because we say well these gifts signs wonders all these different things can be impersonated well then how do we measure signs what should our attitude be towards them how do we place them and in second thessalonians they received not a love of the truth what was it the word the word is what they rejected brother branham in question and answers part one there will be false anointed ones and they'll call themselves prophets but how will you recognize them by the word that's how you'll know it by the word whether they are right how we recognize them will be by the word if they say they have the word and then deny the word then there's nothing to it no matter what they do they might heal the sick they might open the eyes of the blind and deny the word stay away from it because again it's that god will honor faith god works in gifts of healings god there's a way that the word of god can be used right and successful in certain ways and he's saying they could open the eyes of the blind they can heal the sick they can kind of tap into that and people can be actually receiving it but if they deny the word then you've got to be able to recognize that that dynamic what's taking place because he says stay away from that i don't care what it is stay with that word regardless because many times i've seen voodoo and all kinds of things take place under healing okay even in that sense that the body even the way that someone could be worked up into some sort of frenzy to have certain manifestations it it's kind of this caution wow i can't give myself over to this i i can't get that taste i can't get that bent or before you know it i'll become like peter yeah i never had any miracles at all didn't even believe in him but now i can't believe unless there are some it's the word that's why we ended in our text in verse 28 of matthew chapter 24. for wheresoever the carcass is there the eagles will be gathered together sign signs everywhere signs everyone point he's here he's there but where where is he he's where the word is where the carcass is and luke it calls it the body where the body is the eagles are gathered together and you know what a gathering of eagles is called a convocation a holy convocation that's what one or more eagles is the convocation this is the convocation today we're gathering together around the body word gathered around the word and what is brother branham when he deals with this in his ministry what is he saying not the pentecostal buzzards not the pentecostal message not luther not wesley where are we gathered together to the word not deceived by signs not deceived by oh go to this body in the desert go over here go over there no it's to the word brother bradman easter seal he says a lot of people that really think they got it when they haven't a lot of people do it because they've got false impression of what they've seen other christians do i think that's that is a perfect statement in itself just to to have weight to that sake can impersonate any of that we know that and as missionaries you can see it impersonated shouting dancing speaking in tongues and all things you can see it impersonated anywhere absolutely now i will say that a lot of these instances brother brown is pointing to some sort of heathen practices and sort of maybe a shaman or some witchcraft or some sort of idol worship manifesting the same signs but we don't just say well as long as they're naming christ it's legit as long as they're naming the message it's legit right some of the most uh charismatic demonstrative some of the best worship best worship music i got to be very careful where i'm going with this but in in the history of the message some of the most dynamic uh moving energizing uh movements are built around a man or a false kingdom or false doctrine and not the message the pure message so he says it can be a person amongst heathen people who deny there is such a thing as jesus christ being the son of god and they do all these things themselves but the real true quickening spirit that comes to a believer quickens him to god's word that's back to eagle food again right back where he lives there's there there it is the word quickens faith no matter what signs follow he comes right back to eagle's food again he knows where he got his faith he knows what energized him he knows what stimulates him it's the stimulation of revelation that gets the believers cited not the signs we believe in them they're wonderful they're great when god gives them it's his grace and we don't deny him at all but i know what produced that and so i come back to the word and that's what energizes me come right back it quickens me back to the word again so sign signs everywhere signs but what are you feeding on there are signs everywhere in this day that we're living in everywhere whether it be long-haired freaky people or whether it be people with no hair at all whatever it is out there there are signs signs everywhere signs and everyone trying to get your attention everyone trying to point you to something everyone trying to say this is it this is it this is it what are we looking to because signs are given in the original form the signs are given to cause someone to look to the promised word because it orients back to the promise it fits it's congruent he sent his word and it produced faith and it healed them so he sent his word he sent his word and we believed and lay hands on the sick and they recovered did this it's kind of it's gonna that system isn't necessarily some sort of closed loop but the way that it works is this input is gonna is gonna give us feedback that the word is real the word is true amen and then in the other sense that we're pointing out and i i want to i want to close so badly but we don't always get what we want just glad you're getting what you need today signs can be impersonated and impersonating them it blind people from truth through the noise the feedback loop well what did brother branham even say anyways [Music] right have you ever been in a meeting where everybody's shouting and saying amen and you're pretty sure they don't hear him anymore i've sat in meetings where i'm like i'm just gonna have to take y'all's word for it because i have no idea what he just said right and in that loop and i'm just going to try to be very very succinct brother branham talks about how deceiving these things are and he makes this statement right up to the very point and then drop back they go right up to the word and then drop back so what is it that happens word faith then in some level there are signs that start to be manifested and in the sign they seem to come right back to the word but drop back to the sign they're coming right back but they always go back to right up to it always drop back right up to it always drop back and brother brahma says and writes this in the church age book chapter 10. have you ever noticed that in the harvest time though there is real acceleration in the ripening there's consequently a slowing of growth until there is no growth is that not exactly what we're seeing now the false vine is losing multitudes to the communist and various other types of belief my son elliot shared with me some outstanding statements by brother adam smith the economist the writer from scotland on on communism in the 18th century and these different some of the things that he even begin to recognize with the pitfalls of communism the false fine is losing multitudes to communism and various other people types of belief her numbers are not increasing as she would like us to think her hold on to people is not what it used to be think of all these charismatic revivals calling people back to god and these um a lot of a lot of times now they're built around music right and brother steve is going around the world with his guitar i don't know how to say his last name so i'm gonna try right and just these great rallies and everyone's it seems like this great move and this call to god he goes and in many cases going to church is just a show talk about the seeds of prophecy you can't find a church anymore that doesn't have stage lighting you go and you're like wait a minute hold on let me adjust right and everything's choreographed you don't think it's choreographed i can actually find the the the audio tracks to the background of the production where they're like all right five four three two cue the smoke one you're on and then it's like done done all right bring in the drums and everyone's got a headset and they're all being told what to do right all right we're coming to the bridge now really work it bring it down bring it down now work the bridge slowly slowly all right five four gonna take up a key three two one and the person's in the back choreographing all of it it's like all right we're going to bring on pastor phil in 10 seconds and pastor phil gets queued up right he comes out with his really expensive sneakers on and anymore tell you right now anymore a lot of the most popular ministries are stand-up comedians they just get up there and they tell they tell stories and riff and they get the people laughing i'm not saying i don't make you laugh but they do all they do is tell a bunch of stories no substance whatsoever and people like this is just so raw and it's just so real and it's just so emotional it's just a show brother brown said and he says in a true vine what about her is she growing where are those vast numbers that keep coming to revivals and answer altar calls and then this is the kind of the this is the the meat here on this are not most of them merely emotional in their approach a desirous of something physical rather than desiring that which is truly spiritual there's therein lies the problem is when your taste becomes for the physical in the emotional instead of that which is truly spiritual and if our faith isn't placed right it'll stagnate while seeking signs and we'll be desperate for something from god and because our faith isn't placed right it's not given us that constant satisfaction even in the absence of what we pray for when your faith is placed right it doesn't devastate you you can believe and you can believe for your healing and you can have your if your faith is placed right then in the absence of your heal and you're like this isn't gonna this isn't i'm not worried about this god's got it all in control whatever god god's i put it in his hands i'm going forward i'm not gonna live under some sort of sentence and your faith is placed right absent any kind of manifestation any kind of confirmation but if your faith isn't placed right and you start asking god for something and your faith has been placed in something else you're gonna find you're trying to find a place to put your faith just give me a sign please i said lord i want someplace to put my foot on i want to be able to put this somewhere oh the doctor didn't give me a very good report i'm starting to feel this i'm starting to feel that and your faith your faith never really grows and gives you that constant satisfaction you're never going to come closer to christ you're never going to grow your faith that's why in this i got to wrap this up brother says come back to the word everything must come back to the word brother braham said every true sign of god is followed by the voice of god every true sign of god is followed by the voice of god let me put that in the realm of a major gift or some sort of major demonstration if there's any big sign that gets your attention that transcends some sort of common natural occurrence look for the voice behind it because any true signs followed by the voice of god and the voice of god will line up with scripture or it'll open your eyes to the reality of that scripture that's how god works that's how god moves that's like the big major major example now just in by analogy any true sign that god is using to build your faith will not point back to the sign or the preacher or the meeting or the camp but it will point you right back to the word it'll have the voice of god following it every true sign think of it these signs shall follow them that believe and what will follow a true sign right back to the voice again amen it's in the word these signs will follow them that believe and say yeah and what follows the signs is the voice of god right comes right back to it that's good and queen of sheba many people are following signs it isn't the sign it's the voice that goes with the sign moses when he was given two signs god told him if they won't hear the voice of the first sign and they'll hear the voice of the second sign each sign is just a sign uh can i just humor you for a moment not to turn this into a stand-up comedy but i honestly told myself for once i'm going to be short today i did i was like this is going to be awesome we're going to be done we're going to rest this afternoon and it's 1202. i mean at least i'm aware right very self-aware and and sometimes i be honest if if i'm ever making you uncomfortable or belaboring you or you're kind of you're fed up or there's something don't like let's just talk about it i mean not right now let's talk about it because i'm sensitive my brother and this happens that happens or it's going there's my kids this let's talk about it because this is about this really is about you because if you weren't here i wouldn't be here i'm here because of you so i'm very sensitive to what you need as a body and i may be the pastor but i'm not i'm the one that is following the christ the leadership christ and his leadership has you in mind so with that i'm going to continue to preach more than an hour and a half he says each sign is just a sign man has gifts and things but watch what's behind it i hope this is coming to that balance that signs will follow them that believe well signs can be manipulated they can be misused they can be misunderstood it can throw you into another place well then what do we do what do we do well you got to come back to the word that's what that's what it must point back to it must point back to the word you got to come back to the word the sign should point you back to the word if it's not a scriptural sign if you don't know what to do it's like that seems really odd that you prayed that in the morning if your car was upside down on its roof that that would mean this that or the other like i don't know where to place that in the scripture what you wanted or what you asked for leave it alone that's between them and whoever prayed so you're coming back to the word and then he's showing us that now because what happens it's this the voice the word will follow the sign because that's what he wanted you to do in in the end is come to him the word so he's saying he says that man has gifts but watch what's behind it satan can impersonate anything almost he's an impersonator and he can impersonate but watch the kind of voice that it is what does it do the voice of the sign take a person walk up big when they what they can do and all and all this thing don't you pay no attention to that what's he talking about that boasting that braggadocio the bragging after the signs the pointing to the person and we did this and we did that pointing to some movement trying to vindicate this right here this is this is where it's happening and this is what it is kind of something you recognize those platitudes where it's almost as if now all the attention is trying to be shifted away from the word of god to this the new shiny flashy thing watch that because he says notice this god's spirit is a meek spirit humble spirit full of love and compassion looking to all people and bringing all people to a knowledge of christ so it's that you're you're watching what follows in the voice of the sign brother man says we find out that god gave moses the signs to prove claims and callings that's what he gave him for to prove and every true sign every true sign that sent from god has a voice behind it now don't fail this is my last lesson on this every true sign now we have signs that's not from god satan can almost impersonate anything that there is but a true sign sent from god has the voice of god behind it so we're in a in a quandary well brother aaron you've really you got us all excited about signs and now we're not so sure we don't know what you should go by anymore go by the word what's the voice that follows the signs is it trying to bring you back to a pentecostal message is it kind of signaling it when you look at well this is this is what it pertains to this is what it points to this is what it leads to you can have enough discernment to recognize that isn't that what jesus cast to get him for you could discern the skies and you can do all sorts of things and predict but you can't even look at something that's happening in a spiritual realm and say well i know exactly what this is pointing to is it trying to bring you to an organization is it trying to point you to some sort of man's kingdom is it wanting you to deny the bible as the absolute is it trying to get you to deny the word of god is it wanting to add to or take away look at what it's pointing to in the message going beyond the camp the subtitled going beyond 1205. as i look and preach across the nation and watch the people i am fully persuaded that the people are not getting to christ i just focus now i got i got this statement and uh john can you just do me a favor and just cycle forward through the remaining slides we can count it's one for the next one well no i want to do it together some of us aren't good at math just kind of just arrow through here this is all we have left keep going just keep going all the way in see look all right then one more quote look at this we're almost there going beyond the camp i'm fully persuaded that people are not getting to christ and i believe that it's the enemy that's thrown this hindrance the reason i believe this is he's not the object that they have been pointed to they have either been pointed to a dogma or a doctrine or a party or experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to christ the word god let us never be guilty of this that's why i think that the people are resting their eternal destination upon some dogma or some sensation it's because of what their loop is pointing to a dogma they can be very legalistic to be very cold very formal it's the wrong kind of legalist feedback loop or it can tend to the fanaticism some sort of party or experience or sensation they're resting their eternal destination on some dogma or some sensation like some say i danced in the spirit i spoke with tongues i felt fire run over me and do you know all those things can be impersonated by the devil there's just one thing he cannot impersonate that's the word in the debate between he and jesus each time jesus defeated him it is written the word and i believe today that the reason that people are not coming to christ is because they're pointed many of them to a denomination you come join our church or you read our catechism or believe our doctrine or some system of some sort and that's what i charted in signs to signs that's a system it's a closed system it's a self-confirming feedback loop that's completely left god's system that'll always point you back to christ a major v major and a minor always going to come back to christ they are pointed in the wrong way the signs been shifted it used to say christ this way but now the sign points to another sign and you go to this sign it points you to this side and you go this side boy we're getting somewhere aren't we in this awesome i'm loving this laodicean time come on sign decide to sign to sign let us never be guilty of not pointing to christ let it be real and everything we say everything we believe in everything we do it's christ the word that has the preeminence god bless us i'm just going to read this last statement if you counted the slides you know how many are left and this will just go lord will and just sum up the foundational part of christ my healer and then i want to i want to teach things from this message to that can get us to believe all things are possible for healing there's a lot of needs that we're facing physically even in our own church or family members and i believe god's going to come on the scene for us chapter 5 of the church age book he's quoting from matthew chapter 7 verses 21 to 23 many shall come to me in that day and say and he says the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow that is bible now i want you to recognize this pattern now jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the burgundian age which was that yeah as a yet 200 years off from the patmos vision he knew that drift would cause them to go into the dark ages remember brother braham is reading this after matthew chapter 7 many shall come to me in that day and say i've done these many wonderful works so what starts the drift where does the drift begin he knew that the way man would originally get away from god was by first leaving the word and if you leave that word you've left god thus he's presented himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages whether you're in a scientific age whether you're in a party age whether you're in experience camp whether whatever camp you're in whatever fanaticism you're going for whatever legalism you're in bondage to he presents himself as thus because the way that you end up in darkness is you deviate from the word and the drift can begin not just by getting cold and formal and slouching and becoming very harsh and rigid and legalistic and denying signs but you can also begin to drift when all you do is follow signs and next thing you know you've drifted from the truth he says here he is his presentation this is what we want to do this is what we want to receive i am the word i am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word you want healing here receive the healer don't let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which i am giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that let us never forget this christ is the ultimate he is what we want if we want him above all recognize this that in christ he is he is in christ he is the giver therefore in him or all gifts whether it be healing whether it be salvation whatever it is it is in christ and as it is lip services paid time and time again i don't want the gifts i want the giver listen we mean it for real we are the ones who have seen the sign demonstrated we are the ones that have heard the voice crying that christ himself has descended the shout has gone forth christ the living bread of life is drawing a bride to himself and i want to receive him knowing that in him is everything and in christ is my self-sufficiency and if i have him then i have the giver of every good gift every precious thing and if i have him i have all i need and if you want deity in your midst welcome and receive the word that's why he several statements later he he poses the question i really wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the deity that is in our midst signs can be impressive right but i want the word and i want to be sufficiently impressed
