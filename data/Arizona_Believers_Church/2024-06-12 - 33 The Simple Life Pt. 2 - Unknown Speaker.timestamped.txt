[0:00] This is part two of the simple life and
[0:04] we are we're taking the subject of I'm
[0:07] just trying to think of how we might
[0:08] have phrased it um Sunday morning. You
[0:10] might say, "Why didn't you think of this
[0:11] earlier?" Uh but just as we get up here,
[0:14] we want to just kind of feel the
[0:16] leadership of the Lord and just kind of
[0:17] say it the way he'd want us to and set
[0:19] it up the way that he's desiring to
[0:21] speak even in this moment. But we were
[0:23] looking how that Christ is revealing
[0:25] himself in the life that we live. Christ
[0:28] unfolding himself in that h sincerity
[0:31] and that humility in that honesty some
[0:33] of those things that we're talking about
[0:35] um in LA these last several services. So
[0:37] he's he's living himself out in
[0:38] simplicity. I've been studying a lot in
[0:41] harvest time and so I'm drawing a lot
[0:43] from there. But I just want to jump
[0:45] right into this by mentioning a few
[0:46] other sermon titles that I believe touch
[0:49] on this in a way or brother Bam is
[0:51] foreshadowing something very very
[0:53] tremendous in in the word of God and he
[0:56] takes these different titles a hidden
[0:58] life then he has another title a hidden
[1:00] life in Christ or kind of subtitled
[1:03] inside life with Christ and then he
[1:05] ministered a hidden life with Christ.
[1:08] And so we're looking at this life that
[1:10] is lived. When we talk about a hidden
[1:11] life, it doesn't mean we're secret
[1:13] Christians.
[1:14] Too bad, right? You know, secret message
[1:16] believers. We want to blend in with the
[1:18] world. We want to go the way everyone
[1:20] else is going. But when he talks about
[1:21] the hidden life, he means there is a
[1:24] life inside of you. There's this secret
[1:26] place where the Holy Spirit is sealed up
[1:28] into your soul. And there you're
[1:30] communing with God. And it's that hidden
[1:32] life. And it's from there, that source
[1:34] of life, from that new birth experience
[1:36] that you then begin to live and and walk
[1:40] through the world and and make your way
[1:42] in in life. And so, we're wanting to
[1:45] come from that perspective that there is
[1:47] a life unseen. There is a power of God
[1:49] that dwells within the human soul that
[1:51] has been born again. It's that hidden
[1:53] life. It's an inside life with Christ.
[1:55] Brother Abraham touches on that many
[1:57] different ways, but in those few
[1:58] sermons, he really, really details it.
[2:01] Now, one thing I'm wanting to use is
[2:03] this idea that if that life is hidden on
[2:06] the inside, then the life that you live
[2:09] is manifesting or interpreting what's
[2:11] inside of you. Brother Brandham said, "A
[2:13] sanctified life reveals Jesus Christ."
[2:17] Uh, nature itself reveals Jesus Christ.
[2:20] So, the life reveals the nature that's
[2:24] on the inside.
[2:26] And we even characterize people that
[2:28] way. Well, they're this they're they're
[2:29] stubborn or they're very creative. And
[2:31] it's probably never been said of
[2:33] somebody who is creative that they were
[2:35] creative and they've never done anything
[2:36] creative, right? It's it's the life they
[2:39] live. It's the things they express and
[2:41] say, "Oh, they they do this and they do
[2:42] that." So, the life reveals the nature
[2:45] of somebody and it's the life that we
[2:47] live that reveals the nature of the
[2:49] word. And that's the principles of the
[2:52] seed. Now, tonight I want to focus on I
[2:55] want to be very specific on something
[2:57] that I'd like to teach tonight. And it's
[2:59] it's foundational. It's something that I
[3:01] think uh works very well with this
[3:03] series we're preaching on the house of
[3:05] the Lord because in the house of the
[3:06] Lord, my thought is where he dwells,
[3:08] where he's revealing himself from.
[3:10] There's been a lot of titles that we've
[3:12] used lately, but we're looking at a lot
[3:13] of the home life uh and how important
[3:16] home life is. And I realize we can never
[3:18] separate uh the the the nature of our
[3:21] house, the nature of our lives, or even
[3:24] what we want to express, the things we
[3:25] want to do from the word that it's if we
[3:28] sometimes there's this attitude that if
[3:30] you really want to know how to fix your
[3:31] marriage, you need to go to Colorado
[3:32] Springs to do that. Or if you want
[3:34] really want to know how to entertain
[3:35] your kids, you got to go to Colorado
[3:37] Springs to do that. But I don't believe
[3:38] that we have to um borrow from the
[3:41] world. I don't think that we have to uh
[3:43] go to other sources and psychology to
[3:45] get the things that we need, but the
[3:47] word of God is what we need for
[3:49] everything. And we don't want to be
[3:52] narrow-minded about what that word is.
[3:54] But this is some So, we've been touching
[3:55] on home life. I'm still kind of in that
[3:57] channel, but I'm wanting to look at
[3:59] something very foundational that would
[4:01] help with any subject when it comes to
[4:03] the word of God. Now in 2 Corinthiansap
[4:06] 11:3,
[4:08] Paul says something here that we started
[4:10] with on Sunday, but I fear less by any
[4:12] means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[4:14] through his subtlety. So he's wanting us
[4:16] to think about the transaction that took
[4:19] place in the garden of Eden where the
[4:22] serpent uh under the inspiration and
[4:25] influence of the devil deceived Eve. He
[4:28] was subtle. It was he had a way of
[4:30] speaking to her and engaging with her
[4:33] that caused her to see something in a
[4:35] way that she ought not to have seen it.
[4:38] And so just as the serpent beguiled Eve,
[4:40] he's he fears lest our minds or as he's
[4:43] writing to the Corinthians, their minds
[4:45] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[4:48] that is in Christ. And it's that
[4:50] simplicity that was what drew me to
[4:52] this. It's the simplicity in Christ uh
[4:55] uh that had my attention. And then I'm
[4:57] realizing in this Paul is identifying
[5:00] that the Satan wants to beguile us or
[5:02] deceive us or distract us and take us
[5:04] away from the simplicity that is in
[5:07] Christ. That that Satan's objective is
[5:10] to find some way to make this more
[5:12] complicated than it should be. So, uh
[5:14] just to kind of bring back carry forward
[5:17] some things from Sunday morning, the
[5:19] temptation or the tempting of the woman
[5:21] in the garden and the tempting of Christ
[5:23] in the wilderness as we've just read it.
[5:25] It exposes Satan's schemes. The same
[5:28] tactics he used in the garden are the
[5:30] same tactics he uses in the wilderness.
[5:32] And how he approached him and saying,
[5:34] "If thou be the son of God, then turn
[5:36] these stones into bread." And Jesus,
[5:38] it's in his first response that he gives
[5:40] us the whole secret. Man shall not live
[5:41] by bread alone, these external things,
[5:43] the things that satisfy the flesh. But
[5:45] he must live by every word. So take it
[5:48] that way. When he says man shall not
[5:50] live by every by word alone but by every
[5:52] word that proceedth out of the mouth of
[5:53] God. He's not saying that man has to
[5:55] live by natural bread and spiritual
[5:57] bread. He's actually saying that man c
[6:00] has to live and can only live by every
[6:03] word of God.
[6:04] So that's the that's the most important
[6:06] thing and that's the at the heart of
[6:08] this temptation. And then he says well
[6:11] if you are the son of God and cast
[6:12] yourself down from the temple and
[6:14] there'll be this great supernatural
[6:16] display as the angels identify
[6:17] themselves with you. Jesus answers again
[6:19] with the word. So Satan is use he's
[6:23] using tactics. He's using schemes in the
[6:25] temptation in the garden and then also
[6:27] in the wilderness. And that's the same
[6:30] tactics are what he uses today. And what
[6:32] he's doing then shows us where he
[6:34] battles us today where the greatest
[6:36] battle is ever fought. And as we said
[6:39] before, this is what I want to touch on
[6:40] for the remainder of this evening. Satan
[6:42] is fighting where God is expressing
[6:44] himself. If God's not there, if God's
[6:47] not doing something, Satan's not worried
[6:48] about it. So, Satan targets where God is
[6:51] expressing himself. I want to use it in
[6:53] the same language we use Sunday morning
[6:54] that whatever God whatever he thinks
[6:56] God's doing next, he attacks that.
[6:58] Whatever he knows God's doing next, he
[7:01] attacks that. Satan's always trying to
[7:02] find God at his next move and he's
[7:04] trying to read the signs and he's trying
[7:06] to figure things out because he wants to
[7:07] preempt the work of God. We find in
[7:10] Revelations 12 when the woman was
[7:12] getting ready to give birth, there was
[7:13] the dragon waiting to snatch the child
[7:16] as soon as it was born. So the dragon
[7:18] was there and wanting to take advantage
[7:20] of this opportunity because he saw what
[7:23] was coming and knowing what was coming.
[7:25] He wanted to be there very quickly uh to
[7:27] to snatch that a and always there trying
[7:31] to anticipate, always there trying to
[7:32] see what God's doing. So, I'm building
[7:35] from this thought that Satan always
[7:38] attacks where God is or tries to at
[7:40] least trying to find out where God is in
[7:43] order to stop what God's wanting to do.
[7:46] Now, this scripture here in 1
[7:47] Corinthians chapter 2 7 to8 will be um
[7:52] our our launching pad from here. And I
[7:54] may not have another scripture for quite
[7:56] a while this evening.
[7:58] says in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:es 7 and
[8:01] 8, but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[8:05] mystery,
[8:06] even the hidden wisdom wisdom which God
[8:09] ordained before the world unto our
[8:11] glory. Now, there's a lot that we could
[8:13] have read prior to this and even
[8:14] afterwards to give context to what Paul
[8:17] is talking about. This is the hidden uh
[8:19] wisdom of God. It is something he's
[8:22] speaking. So, he's speaking a mystery
[8:23] which is the hidden wisdom of God. and
[8:26] he's speaking something uh that God
[8:29] ordained before the world for our glory.
[8:32] So this wisdom of God that he speaks and
[8:35] it's not a wisdom that's commonly known.
[8:37] It's not the wisdom of man, but it's the
[8:38] wisdom of God. And he speaks it in a way
[8:40] that's a mystery because it's not
[8:42] something you can understand by being
[8:44] human. You have to understand it by
[8:46] having the spirit of God.
[8:48] Now the statement he makes next is what
[8:50] I want to focus on. I'm speaking the
[8:52] wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden
[8:54] wisdom of God which he's ordained for
[8:55] your glory. But then he says, "Which
[8:57] none of the princes of this world knew
[8:59] they they they were not uh they were not
[9:02] seeing this. They had not anticipated
[9:04] this. They they did not have
[9:05] understanding this." He says, "For had
[9:07] they known it, they would not have
[9:08] crucified the Lord of glory."
[9:11] Now, however you want to interpret this,
[9:14] it's quite a statement. Uh the way that
[9:16] it it strikes me is that had they known
[9:19] what he had they known who Christ was
[9:21] and what he had come for they wouldn't
[9:24] have fallen for it or they wouldn't have
[9:26] crucified him because knowing if the
[9:28] princes of this world knew that in
[9:30] crucifying him it would have paid the
[9:32] price. If the devil knew that in
[9:33] crucifying him that man's sins would be
[9:35] atoned for. If the devil knew that he
[9:37] lost by crucifying him he never would
[9:39] have crucified him.
[9:42] And it even goes, you could even look at
[9:43] this from the standpoint that the
[9:45] princes of the world, whether it be uh
[9:46] the rulers at that time or the Jews, uh
[9:49] had they known that this was God's
[9:51] Messiah, they would have never crucified
[9:53] him. Then that speaks to this either
[9:55] way, it speaks to this principle that
[9:58] human knowledge alone will make a mess
[10:01] of God's plan.
[10:04] That even someone saying, "Oh, no. I I
[10:05] don't want Peter even demonstrated, I
[10:07] don't want him to die." If he knew this
[10:09] was the endgame, they would have tried
[10:11] to stop it, even against God's perfect
[10:13] will. But I want you to read this this
[10:15] way. If you don't feel this is the
[10:16] particular reading, uh you won't offend
[10:18] me if you're if you're staying to how
[10:20] God leads you at all. But if the princes
[10:22] of this world knew what God was doing,
[10:24] they would have never crucified the Lord
[10:26] of glory. Right?
[10:28] So there's Satan is always trying to
[10:31] figure out what God's doing because
[10:33] Satan would say in the final analysis,
[10:35] he'll probably end up saying, "Had I
[10:37] known this is what was going to happen,
[10:39] I would have never crucified him."
[10:40] Right. Right. Right.
[10:42] So, I'm wanting to address very
[10:43] specifically Satan's schemes,
[10:46] what what he is trying to prevent,
[10:50] what he's trying to hinder, why he works
[10:54] so hard against us, why some of you have
[10:56] had such a bad week, why the devil is
[10:59] always on your tail, why things aren't
[11:01] easy,
[11:03] why the message is so reviled, why it's
[11:05] so misunderstood, and maybe even why
[11:08] message believers have been the worst
[11:09] thing for the message.
[11:14] And I want to say this.
[11:17] I hope that you can listen very uh
[11:20] distinctly to what I'm trying to say
[11:21] because I want to read a number of
[11:23] statements. I'll tell you in the outset
[11:24] I'm going to be reading from the seventh
[11:25] seal question and answers on the seals
[11:28] and then also from harvest time and some
[11:30] other places and these are things that
[11:32] brother Brandham said that brother
[11:34] Bradam taught that are difficult for
[11:37] some people to understand easy for some
[11:40] people to misinterpret
[11:42] and and things that would I would say
[11:44] are very controversial in and what he's
[11:46] teaching but I hope that in reading
[11:48] these things to you tonight you can look
[11:50] at it from this standpoint of what God
[11:53] is trying to do for you personally and
[11:56] not try to make it into something
[11:57] mysterious or make it into something
[11:59] about brother Brandham, but look at it
[12:01] as if God had something for me to hear,
[12:03] I want to hear what he has me to hear.
[12:06] And I believe this what we're wanting to
[12:07] approach tonight is very critical and
[12:09] very important. I'm always I'm careful
[12:11] to uh not say that. Uh but I do feel
[12:15] very impressed tonight to say that what
[12:17] I want to share with you and I hope that
[12:18] I can just share it in a way that God
[12:19] will uh uh quicken it to you and how God
[12:22] would want you to see this. But I
[12:24] believe these things are very very
[12:26] important. And I will say this uh that
[12:29] I'm being faithful to my my calling in
[12:32] doing this and I know my audience. Now
[12:34] in the seventh seal,
[12:37] brother Brandham's going to make this
[12:38] statement and I I don't have these
[12:40] statements uh provided in these slides.
[12:42] Um, I I'm not being deliberate
[12:45] necessarily by uh robbing you of the the
[12:47] privilege of seeing uh the quotations on
[12:50] the screen. It's just sometimes I think
[12:52] when it's a lot of them, it's easy to
[12:54] get lost in it and hopefully you could
[12:56] just listen to what uh what we're
[12:58] saying. Brother Bram is he's preaching
[13:00] the seventh seal. He's talking
[13:01] specifically about the seventh seal.
[13:03] He's referring specifically to
[13:04] Revelations 8:1 and or Revelations 8 and
[13:07] then specifically verse one and then
[13:08] also Revelations 10:es 3 and 4. These
[13:12] are things that he's specifically
[13:13] addressing right now. Now, I know that's
[13:15] a mouthful and I know most of you
[13:17] probably know exactly what we're
[13:18] referring to here, but he's talking
[13:19] about these seven thunders uttering
[13:21] their voices, the book being opened in
[13:23] that time of silence. He says, "It is
[13:25] the secret that no one knows about."
[13:28] John was forbidden to write about it,
[13:30] even write a symbol about it. That is
[13:33] why there was no activity in heaven. It
[13:35] might give away the secret. So he's kind
[13:37] of connecting two things together there
[13:39] in that when the seven angels come forth
[13:42] to sound their trumpets.
[13:45] Excuse me. No activity in heaven. It
[13:48] might give away the secret. Do you see
[13:49] it? Now if it's so great it must be
[13:51] included because it's got to happen. Now
[13:53] notice when the seven angels come forth
[13:55] to sound their trumpets, there was one
[13:57] thunder. And he's he's looking back at
[13:58] other instances in scripture. When
[14:00] Israel was gathered, there was a
[14:01] trumpet. When time shall be no more the
[14:03] last trumpet, one thunder. But here is
[14:06] seven straight thunders right in a row.
[14:08] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[14:11] That perfect number. Seven thunders in a
[14:14] row uttered, making just one, two,
[14:15] three, four, five, six, seven straight.
[14:18] I'll stop here and kind of wet your
[14:20] appetite just for these seven so that we
[14:23] can be really mysterious. No, I want to
[14:26] say it in a way to remove kind of the
[14:27] the the aura of it to where, oh, this is
[14:30] this is the area that message
[14:31] theologians really like to dig into. But
[14:34] when it's using this number seven,
[14:36] there's got to be something about it
[14:38] that there would be seven thunder
[14:39] thunders in a row that would utter their
[14:41] voices in a row. Not one and then
[14:43] something happens, but these seven
[14:44] together. And brother Ram teaches us
[14:46] that seven is God's number. He uses that
[14:48] statement specifically. It's God's
[14:50] number. Here he says um perfect that
[14:53] perfect number and it's the complete he
[14:55] says it's the complete number of God. So
[14:58] seven is looking at completion. Uh he
[15:01] says about seven, it's always a mystery.
[15:04] uh it's it's something that is when you
[15:06] look at the word and I'm wanting to use
[15:08] it in this instance when you look at
[15:09] creation in different places that the
[15:10] seven is used it's speaking of something
[15:12] being full and complete so revelation
[15:16] being the book of symbols and even these
[15:18] thunders essentially being a symbol form
[15:20] or something symbolic the seven thunders
[15:23] are symbolic
[15:25] and it's and I'll say this now just in
[15:27] the sense of I'm not saying it's not
[15:32] saying it is but could be
[15:34] I'm not saying it's not seven but what I
[15:37] am saying is that it means more than
[15:39] just seven
[15:40] in other words it's not necessarily
[15:42] meant to be counted but it's symbolic of
[15:45] completion
[15:46] so even if it is actually seven things
[15:49] and we said the seven thunders are seven
[15:51] distinct things then it's not so much
[15:54] the numerology of counting the seven but
[15:57] knowing that it's completion
[15:59] and and we recognize then that there's
[16:01] things that unfold where God is wanting
[16:03] to manifest the complete mystery of
[16:06] himself that it is going to be the Bible
[16:10] is the complete plan of redemption that
[16:12] things have unfolded through all ages
[16:14] until it comes out in the complete where
[16:17] it's fully manifested. There's a full
[16:19] manifestation. So the seven thunders
[16:22] alone are not necessarily I'm wanting to
[16:25] be careful how I say this because what
[16:27] I'm wanting to emphasize tonight is not
[16:28] that we would try to figure out what
[16:30] seven things are or what these seven
[16:33] thunders are but the seven thunders mean
[16:36] completion
[16:38] a time of completion something full
[16:39] something being finished now and I think
[16:43] that's a that's a lot of fun stuff to
[16:44] think about so he says then the heavens
[16:47] couldn't write that heavens can't know
[16:49] about it nothing else because there's
[16:50] nothing to go on. It's a relaxing time.
[16:53] It's so great till it's kept secret from
[16:56] the angels. He says, this is I was
[16:57] reading all that to come to this. Now,
[16:59] why
[17:00] if Satan should get a hold of it, he
[17:03] might do great damage. Yes.
[17:05] Now, notice just how closely that
[17:08] relates to
[17:10] what his scheme in the beginning
[17:12] where Satan is getting in there trying
[17:14] to get a hold of the woman, trying to do
[17:16] great damage, and he succeeded in in
[17:18] bringing forth uh a sin. He succeeded in
[17:21] in interrupting things. But yet, had he
[17:23] known that's what God knew he would do,
[17:26] right? In the final analysis, God put
[17:28] man on that basis. And when Satan worked
[17:31] out that which was necessary in the
[17:33] garden to bring about the plan of God.
[17:36] So this is how Satan works. He's always
[17:38] scheming when he he's there scheming in
[17:41] the wilderness trying to tempt uh the
[17:44] the the Jesus Christ. Had he known that
[17:47] crucifying the Lord of glory was God's
[17:49] plan, he would not have crucified him.
[17:52] So if Satan could get a hold of it, if
[17:54] he could grasp it, if he could know what
[17:55] it was, he would try to do great damage.
[17:57] He said there's one thing he don't know
[17:59] and he says now he can interpret
[18:01] anything he wants to
[18:03] and impersonate any kind of gift. He
[18:07] says I hope you are learning I hope that
[18:10] we can learn this tonight. Satan can
[18:12] interpret anything he wants to and
[18:14] impersonate any kind of a gift. Now I
[18:17] I'm starting to see these things very
[18:19] closely related to where an
[18:20] impersonation is essentially a false
[18:22] interpretation
[18:24] where when one impersonates not with the
[18:26] intent to humor somebody but when one
[18:28] imper impersonates with the intent to
[18:30] deceive that is a false interpretation
[18:32] of that of what it is they're
[18:35] representing.
[18:36] There's there's a if you are who you
[18:38] are, you don't impersonate who you are.
[18:40] You demonstrate who you are because you
[18:42] are who you are. And there might be
[18:44] those who can do a pretty good Aaron
[18:45] Mcgiri impersonation. And if they're
[18:48] trying to present themselves as Aaron
[18:50] McGaryi to fool you into thinking that
[18:52] they're Aaron McGiri, then poor guy,
[18:56] right? What a sad life. All these Yeah,
[18:58] go ahead. Steal someone steals your
[19:00] identity. He's like, I don't know why
[19:01] you'd want that. But there's a there if
[19:03] they're trying to purport to be
[19:05] somebody, that's a false interpretation.
[19:08] So an impersonation is a false
[19:10] interpretation. And he's saying there's
[19:12] two things that he tries to do.
[19:15] Interpret what he wants and impersonate
[19:17] any kind of gift. He says, "I hope
[19:18] you're learning."
[19:20] But he can't know this.
[19:24] It's not even written in the word. It's
[19:25] a total secret. And the angels,
[19:27] everything shut up. If they made one
[19:29] move, it might give something away. So
[19:31] they just shut up. They quit harping.
[19:33] Everything stopped. Seven. God's perfect
[19:35] number. Seven just right down the row.
[19:38] So you following what he's saying?
[19:41] Uh, you know, I was thinking about maybe
[19:43] playing this and and I think you could
[19:45] get it just as easily listening to it,
[19:48] but I wanted to stop and pause, give
[19:51] some emphasis, make you to think about
[19:53] it a little bit as he's walked us
[19:55] through these different steps. If Satan
[19:58] could get a hold of the secret, he would
[19:59] do great damage
[20:01] because he interprets anything he wants
[20:03] to and he impersonate any kind of gift.
[20:05] He says, "I hope you're learning." And
[20:07] then he comes back to the sevens again.
[20:09] And he says, "Seven thunders straight
[20:10] together." And he says, "Like they're
[20:13] spelling out something."
[20:16] So the seven thunders are trying to
[20:18] convey something like they're spelling
[20:20] out something. They mean something. And
[20:22] I want you to think of it. God's number,
[20:24] God's complete, the complete number of
[20:25] God. Notice at that time, John started
[20:28] to write. He said, "Don't write." Jesus
[20:30] never spoke of it. John couldn't write
[20:32] it. Angels knew nothing about it. What
[20:34] is it? It's the thing that Jesus said
[20:36] even the angels of heaven didn't know
[20:38] anything about. He didn't know it
[20:39] himself. Said God only knew it. But he
[20:42] told us when we begin to see these signs
[20:44] coming up. And he says, "And so what
[20:47] what sign is he talking about? The
[20:48] coming of the son of man that no man
[20:50] knows the day or the hour of these
[20:51] things." Those are those are the things
[20:52] he's referring to. Notice we can see
[20:54] these signs coming up. if Satan can get
[20:57] a hold of it.
[21:00] Again, he's coming back to Satan's
[21:02] schemes that if he can get a hold of it,
[21:04] he would do great damage. Now, he gives
[21:06] us this example. He says, "If you want
[21:08] something to happen," he says, "Now,
[21:09] you'll have to take my word for this. If
[21:11] I'm planning on doing something, I know
[21:13] better than to tell anybody about it.
[21:16] Not that the person will tell it, but
[21:18] Satan will hear it."
[21:21] Please listen to what he says. I think
[21:23] this is so relevant to the point he's
[21:24] making. He can't get in my heart there.
[21:28] As long as God's got it closed up with
[21:30] the Holy Spirit. So, it's between me and
[21:33] God.
[21:34] He can't get in the heart. He can't get
[21:36] in that secret place. He can't get in
[21:39] that place where God reveals himself.
[21:42] He don't know anything about it until
[21:45] you speak it, then he hears it.
[21:48] He's saying, "Now, now if I want to do
[21:50] something," he says, "You'll just have
[21:51] to take my word for it. I want you to
[21:52] show you what I mean." that before there
[21:55] if I if I want to do something I just
[21:57] don't go tell people what I'm doing
[21:59] because then Satan will hear what I'm
[22:01] trying to do and he'll try to get out
[22:02] ahead of it and he'll try to keep it
[22:04] from happening.
[22:05] So he says that but if I get something
[22:07] in my heart as long it's between me and
[22:10] God. Satan can't get there.
[22:12] He can't interrupt that until it's too
[22:15] late necessarily when it comes out. He
[22:18] sees it and he hears it but it's too
[22:19] late for him to do something about it.
[22:21] Amen.
[22:21] He said I've tried. I I'll tell people I
[22:24] hope you catch there what I mean is that
[22:26] there's there's something about the
[22:28] revelation of God when it sticks.
[22:30] He says, "I've tried. I'll tell people
[22:32] I'll do a certain thing and watch the
[22:33] devil cut off every will he can to get
[22:35] there to beat me to it.
[22:37] But if I can get the revelation from God
[22:40] and just don't say anything about it,
[22:42] then it's different."
[22:45] So I don't need to do talking. I don't
[22:47] need to do explaining. I don't need to
[22:49] be articulating. I if I can just get the
[22:52] revelation from God. Don't say anything
[22:54] about it, but just do it.
[22:56] I hope you're listening.
[22:58] I hope you're listening to what he's
[22:59] saying. If I can get the revelation from
[23:01] God and I don't need to talk about it, I
[23:03] just need to do it. He said, "Then it's
[23:05] different."
[23:06] There's my emphasis on it. I hope you
[23:08] can just catch what the difference
[23:10] between what he's saying and I'm saying.
[23:12] He says, "Remember, Satan will try to
[23:14] impersonate.
[23:16] He will try to impersonate
[23:18] everything that the church will do.
[23:20] He's tried to do it. We've noticed it
[23:22] through the antichrist. But this one
[23:24] thing he cannot impersonate.
[23:27] There'll be no mimics to this cuz he
[23:29] don't know it.
[23:30] There's no way for him to know it.
[23:32] It's the third pool.
[23:35] He just knows nothing about it. He
[23:37] doesn't understand it.
[23:39] So it is Satan alone
[23:42] here in this instance. Satan. A
[23:45] characteristic of Satan is that he
[23:47] doesn't understand the third pull.
[23:53] Now, it's at this moment that brother
[23:54] Brandham originally stopped the tape and
[23:57] recorded over it. But this is what he
[24:00] begins to say. He said, "But there's a
[24:01] secret laid beneath that. Glory to God
[24:04] in the highest. I can never think the
[24:05] same the rest of my life. I know the
[24:08] next step there, but I don't know what
[24:11] or how to interpret that. It won't be
[24:14] long. I've got wrote down here when it
[24:15] happened. If you stop, he says, it won't
[24:17] be long. I've got wrote down here when
[24:19] it happened. If you can see here, stop.
[24:22] Go no further than this right here. So,
[24:24] he has it written in his note. Stop. And
[24:26] he says, I'm not prone to be a fanatic.
[24:28] I'm just telling the truth. And notice
[24:30] right where he goes. But you remember
[24:32] the little shoe that I always tried to
[24:34] explain how that the soul laid next to
[24:36] so- and so and the inner conscience and
[24:37] all that kind of stuff, which only made
[24:39] a big bunch of impersonations start
[24:41] after it. how you'd have to take the
[24:43] hand and hold the people and have a
[24:44] vibration. Everybody had a vibration in
[24:46] your hand. But you remember when he took
[24:48] me up there and said, "This is that
[24:50] third pull." And no one will know it.
[24:52] He says, "You remember that visions
[24:54] never fail. They're perfectly the
[24:56] truth."
[24:58] It's at this point he does he's he's
[25:00] orienting the people back to the vision
[25:02] he had that had three parts. He's lacing
[25:05] a booty. He's got too big of a lace for
[25:07] the eyelet. He's fishing. He jerks too
[25:09] soon. He gets everybody excited. But
[25:11] then he's carried away to that tent. And
[25:13] there he said, "This will be the third
[25:15] pool. I'll meet you there." And he says,
[25:16] "You've said too much about the other
[25:17] things. You've explained too much. You
[25:20] can't say too much now. Don't explain
[25:22] it. Don't don't try to explain this. You
[25:24] can't do it." And so he says, "I I want
[25:27] to I need to stop right here. I don't
[25:29] want to go any further." Now, he go as
[25:32] he continues, he says, "It's not
[25:34] revealed yet, but I believe it's moving
[25:36] into that cycle." So, brother Brandon
[25:39] was not saying, "All right, this is it.
[25:41] We'll know nothing about it. We'll never
[25:43] know anything about it." But he's saying
[25:44] there should be some expectation or
[25:46] anticipation that whatever this part is
[25:49] that needs interpreting that that it's
[25:51] going to unfold. It's going to move into
[25:53] a cycle where it will be manifest.
[25:56] And so, when he re-records it the next
[25:59] day, I believe it is, he makes this
[26:01] statement. will be and I think this is
[26:03] the first statement he starts with will
[26:04] be a good thing that he doesn't know
[26:06] anything about it. So he so he comes and
[26:08] he stops here. There'll be no mimics to
[26:11] this. There's no way for him to know it.
[26:12] It's the third pull. He just knows
[26:14] nothing about it. He doesn't understand
[26:16] it. It will be a good thing that he
[26:18] doesn't know anything about it because
[26:19] if he did then he would impersonate
[26:21] that.
[26:23] That's his tricks. So he can know it in
[26:27] a way that there's there's something
[26:29] that if he knew it, he would impersonate
[26:31] it.
[26:32] And it's in other words, it's not it's
[26:34] something he can't have.
[26:37] So he's it's something he can
[26:38] impersonate. That's his tricks in doing
[26:41] things.
[26:42] We're looking at his schemes, his
[26:43] temptations. So therefore, God has made
[26:46] it so hid to the world, even to heaven,
[26:48] that there's no way of understanding it.
[26:50] Only as God will reveal it himself.
[26:54] Now, are have you followed me to this
[26:56] point? Are you still with me?
[26:59] Then let's go back to something we
[27:01] emphasized Sunday. What was the emphasis
[27:03] when he came to this? And I know you
[27:05] might be thinking, your title is the
[27:07] simple life. When are you ever going to
[27:09] talk about that?
[27:11] I think this is the simple life.
[27:14] So, what was the emphasis? It's not a
[27:16] misinterpretation. It's not an
[27:18] impersonation, but it's the revelation
[27:20] of the word. And what did he tell us at
[27:22] the very time that these very things are
[27:24] being spoken? Live a good Christian
[27:26] life.
[27:27] He exhorted them to be a humble
[27:29] Christian. He said, "Live for God. Live
[27:31] honesty honestly with fellow man. Love
[27:34] those who don't love you."
[27:36] He gives the examples of being found
[27:37] doing exactly what you're supposed to be
[27:39] doing as a farmer.
[27:41] A
[27:41] as a planter, as a harvester, be doing
[27:44] what you're supposed to be doing. And he
[27:46] said that Satan is an interpreter and as
[27:50] being trying to interpret he becomes an
[27:52] impersonator. He says don't try to
[27:55] interpret the things.
[27:57] Don't try to do anything more than just
[28:00] live a close life giving praise and
[28:02] honor to Jesus Christ. Then he says it
[28:05] this. Now I trust that each and every
[28:07] one of you will serve God and do that
[28:09] which is right and love him all your
[28:10] life and serve him and God will take
[28:12] care of the rest. What will he take care
[28:15] of? reveal it himself.
[28:17] What will he take care of? All these
[28:18] things that relate to this. So, we have
[28:20] to have the proper attitude. We don't
[28:22] want to dismiss it,
[28:24] right? And say, "Well, I read the seven
[28:25] seal book once and I put it away." Or
[28:27] God said, Brother Ram said, "Don't try
[28:28] to interpret it. So, let's just bury it
[28:31] and get it out of our minds and never
[28:32] touch on it again." Maybe we should
[28:33] wrestle with it more. Not to try to
[28:36] interpret it, but to understand what God
[28:38] would want us to know. Because at the
[28:40] core of this is living a humble
[28:41] Christian life, living honestly before
[28:43] mankind, living for God and and living
[28:46] the life if I could put it that way. So
[28:50] this is this has been this is to for me
[28:53] this has been a lot already that I've
[28:55] expressed to you that I think is very
[28:56] very weighty. And now let me add this to
[29:00] it on question and answers on the seals.
[29:03] This backs up those statements I just
[29:04] read to you. So when we come to the
[29:06] seventh seal, he says the devil, he can
[29:08] interpret anything he wants to. He can
[29:09] impersonate any kind of gift. He says,
[29:12] "But these seven thunders are trying to
[29:13] spell something out." And he says, "But
[29:16] this this is the third pool." You got
[29:18] that?
[29:19] I just want I want to point to that so
[29:22] you realize that when we're talking
[29:23] about this next part, they're connected
[29:24] together. So in question and answers on
[29:27] the sills he says then also knowing
[29:31] brother's talking about rivers of water
[29:33] and he says that it's the same stream
[29:35] same water but different channels and
[29:37] he's talking about being pulled in and
[29:38] out of different channels leading up to
[29:40] it and I thought there was a lot we
[29:41] could draw from that but then I realized
[29:43] I'm just maybe starting to get into some
[29:45] areas that might uh belabor this. He
[29:47] said then I'm knowing that right among
[29:49] you things are happening that I just
[29:51] know you don't see it. I'm positive that
[29:55] you don't see it.
[29:57] You say, "Brother Bram, that's a hard
[29:59] thing for you to say. I know it is." But
[30:01] look, let me just say this now
[30:05] and
[30:07] try to take in what he's saying. And not
[30:09] that, you know, not that I'm saying just
[30:10] accept it. Try to, you know, wrestle
[30:12] with it. Think about it. Think about
[30:13] what he's saying here. Let me just say
[30:16] this now. I suppose this just just I I
[30:19] suppose this is just tapes for ourselves
[30:21] and so forth. But let me say this that
[30:24] you don't get it and you're not supposed
[30:26] to get it.
[30:29] So don't try to interpret anything.
[30:31] Don't try to put your interpretation to
[30:34] it. You only get further away.
[30:37] So if you're if you're looking at the
[30:39] letter of it, if you're trying to
[30:40] dissect it, if you're trying to get it
[30:42] all figured out, you say this is to the
[30:44] everyone in general, don't try to do it.
[30:46] You only get further away from it. The
[30:48] more you try to interpret it and figure
[30:50] out, the further away you get. He said,
[30:51] "Just take my advice if you believe me."
[30:53] Now, if God has given me favor in your
[30:55] sight and you know that them
[30:56] revelations, he says, "I've been with
[30:58] you a long time. It's always been right.
[30:59] And now to double prove it, it hooks
[31:01] right in with the word." So, you know
[31:03] that it's thus sayeth the Lord. That's
[31:06] exactly it's proved to you. Now, those
[31:08] that's that's a lot of that's some stuff
[31:10] for brother Bram to say.
[31:12] Uh you shouldn't take that lightly what
[31:13] he's trying to express there.
[31:16] So he says, "Now take my advice as your
[31:18] brother. Don't put your own
[31:21] interpretation to anything. You just go
[31:24] on and live I want you I want to focus
[31:25] on this part. You go on and live a good
[31:28] Christian life
[31:29] because you only wind yourself away from
[31:31] the real thing when you do it.
[31:34] Not from not if you live a Christian
[31:36] life, but if you try to put your
[31:37] interpretation on things, you'll wind
[31:40] yourself away from the real thing." So
[31:42] the only way to stay in the real thing
[31:44] is to continue to live a good Christian
[31:46] life. He says you only wind your way
[31:48] again way again away from the thing.
[31:52] So even he says it in a way it's kind of
[31:54] mysterious. You know the the real thing
[31:55] and the thing. So if I try to figure out
[31:57] the real thing, if I'm trying to
[31:58] interpret and figure out, I'm getting
[32:00] further away from it. But if I live a
[32:02] good Christian life,
[32:04] I'm not getting further away from
[32:07] the real thing. If
[32:09] I'm not trying to interpret and figure
[32:10] it out, I'm not trying to talk about it
[32:12] and explain it to everybody, but I'm
[32:14] just trying to live a good Christian
[32:15] life. I won't wind myself away from it.
[32:18] Now, could it be that you're winding
[32:20] yourself closer to it?
[32:22] Could you get him getting him deeper
[32:23] into it?
[32:25] He says, "And all of you are conscious
[32:26] and know that there's something
[32:28] mysterious happening and it is happening
[32:30] and I know what it is."
[32:32] Well, then just tell us, brother Bam.
[32:33] Just tell us what it is.
[32:35] Said, I'm not saying that. He said,
[32:37] "It's the grace that lets me know that
[32:40] what it is. It's something that's
[32:42] tremendous and it's gone right now and
[32:43] there's not a way in the world for you
[32:45] to see it. But so help me with the Bible
[32:47] in my hand. I know what it is.
[32:50] So please tell us, brother Brandham.
[32:53] It's been told to you before. So just
[32:56] don't try to put any interpretation, but
[32:58] just believe me as your brother." And
[33:01] then he says this, "We're living in a
[33:03] great hour. We're living in a time where
[33:06] the well we're
[33:09] well you just be real humble.
[33:13] I know what it is. I know what it is. I
[33:14] know what it is. We're living in a great
[33:15] time. We're living in a time when well
[33:19] I've been told not to say anything. He
[33:21] even has it in his notes written for
[33:23] later on. Stop. Don't go any further.
[33:24] He's so nervous about it. He records
[33:26] over it and doesn't release the things
[33:28] that he said that that evening before.
[33:30] So when he comes up to this spot, he
[33:32] says, "Just be real humble. Be a
[33:35] Christian and try to live for God and
[33:38] live honest with your fellow man and
[33:40] love those who don't love you.
[33:42] Don't try to make any You see, you do
[33:45] you only make it a mysterious something
[33:47] and mess the real program of God up.
[33:50] So when you're trying to interpret it
[33:52] and not being a real humble Christian,
[33:54] not living for God, not being honest,
[33:56] not loving those who don't love you, and
[33:58] you're trying to be something and be a
[34:01] mysterious something, you mess the
[34:02] program of God up. So let me just invert
[34:05] it for you. So, could it be that if
[34:07] we're humble, living a good Christian
[34:09] life, we'll actually help the we will
[34:12] actually be in the program of God and it
[34:15] will be coming to pass.
[34:17] That if we're doing the opposite, we're
[34:19] messing the program of God up. But if
[34:20] I'm doing exactly that, could that be
[34:22] the program of God?
[34:26] He says, "Yesterday afternoon, something
[34:28] happened in my room that I'll never be
[34:29] able to leave it. About two weeks ago,
[34:31] something happened that I'll never be
[34:32] able to. As long as I live on this
[34:34] earth, I'll never be able to get away
[34:35] from it. Those things seem so mysterious
[34:37] in itself. So, Brother Adam, you're
[34:39] telling us not to be mysterious, but
[34:41] you're playing the game of mystery.
[34:44] He says, "So, but if the church," he
[34:45] says, "if you're not supposed to know
[34:47] these things." I think that that's how I
[34:48] take it. But if the church, you're not
[34:50] supposed to know these things,
[34:53] and the way it's often struck me is that
[34:55] if you don't go to this church and these
[34:57] things aren't for you, then then don't
[35:00] get worried about it. But he says, "So
[35:02] don't put no interpretation to anything.
[35:09] you just go ahead and just remember what
[35:11] you're told. Live a Christian life,
[35:14] go to your church, be a real light
[35:17] wherever you are, and just burn for
[35:19] Christ and tell the people how much you
[35:21] love them.
[35:23] On the on the heels of these things,
[35:25] being very mysterious and wondering what
[35:27] it could be and things that you said,
[35:29] "Oh my, this is could this be the
[35:31] fulfillment of scripture? Could this
[35:32] really be these things that we've read
[35:34] about? Could these things in the
[35:35] scripture be coming to pass? And you
[35:36] think, "Oh, well, this this would make
[35:38] us really mysterious. This would make us
[35:39] really important. This should be a
[35:42] certain way. Something should be
[35:44] happening here." But he says, "Just live
[35:46] for God. Be a Christian." He says, "Cuz
[35:49] if you don't, just let your testimony be
[35:51] with love all with the people all the
[35:53] time. Because if you don't, you twist
[35:55] yourself out into something there and
[35:58] then you're off the beaten track.
[36:02] When you if you don't live a Christian
[36:04] life and go to church,
[36:07] I'm sorry for those who are here.
[36:09] Testimony isn't love all the time with
[36:10] the people. You're off the beaten track.
[36:12] The real thing, the program of God, the
[36:15] the beaten track. He said, "See, every
[36:16] time you try to do it, you've done that.
[36:19] So, just don't try to make no
[36:21] interpretation.
[36:24] And especially tonight when that seal
[36:26] comes up in front of you, just don't
[36:29] interpret it.
[36:31] you. Now, we've already told you what it
[36:33] is, right? It's the third pull. We've
[36:35] already given you the language. We're
[36:36] kind of going backwards, but I want you
[36:39] to hear these things in light of what he
[36:41] was going to say. So, we we've rehearsed
[36:43] what he said, but now we're looking at
[36:45] how he's approached it leading up to it.
[36:48] Don't interpret it. Don't make any
[36:49] interpretation, especially tonight when
[36:51] that seal comes up. Don't try to
[36:53] interpret it. you just go ahead and just
[36:55] be humble.
[36:57] And just go right on with the same plain
[37:00] message.
[37:02] We're fellowshipping with some friends
[37:03] Monday night and the term plain was
[37:05] used. It says, "Well, plain may just it
[37:07] may seem just to be misunderstood, plain
[37:09] or ordinary." And they're talking about
[37:10] something in particular. Says, "But it's
[37:12] not plain, it's simple." I was like, "I
[37:14] kind of like that. I can go with that
[37:16] because it's not plain and ordinary in a
[37:18] worldly sense." But he says, "Keep going
[37:20] on with the same plain message." the
[37:22] same simple message.
[37:24] The message which you've heard,
[37:27] go ahead, be humble, and go on with the
[37:29] same message. Now, you say, and you can
[37:33] see where he's tapping into this mindset
[37:35] that if these things be true, especially
[37:36] when this seal comes up before you
[37:38] tonight, say, "Brother Brandom, we'd be
[37:40] in the church of the living God,
[37:41] shouldn't we?" Well, as I was trying to
[37:44] look here, I want to say, "Why can't I?
[37:46] I ought to have."
[37:49] There's this thought that well if this
[37:51] is the third pole or if this is the word
[37:53] of God if if this is Jesus Christ the
[37:55] same yesterday today and forever well
[37:57] then shouldn't we and shouldn't we ought
[37:59] to and wouldn't it look like this and
[38:01] shouldn't it do this
[38:03] he says no no you remember I'm saying
[38:06] this for your good I'm saying it so
[38:08] you'll understand if you believe me now
[38:10] listen to what I tell you
[38:13] so he's wanting to caution that gung-ho
[38:15] pepper alley attitude that oh if this is
[38:17] what it is
[38:19] that we should just start cussing the
[38:20] devil, right? And we should just be so
[38:22] bold as to go into the uh the red light
[38:25] district and converting prostitutes and
[38:27] just go into the hospital and start uh
[38:29] casting out demons and healing cancers.
[38:31] In other words, he's thinking there's
[38:33] this renegade idea with this where he's
[38:35] saying that's not the humble life.
[38:37] That's not what we're talking about.
[38:42] Now, this part here to me is amazing.
[38:46] And again, I I I I still want to uh
[38:48] preach as the Lord leads and expound
[38:50] upon it, being faithful to the message.
[38:53] I'm not trying to interpret it myself.
[38:54] I'm not trying to put a spin on it. If I
[38:56] I'll say this,
[38:58] Brother Bam is saying, "Don't interpret
[39:00] it." So, we're not we're not
[39:01] interpreting it. We're just going to say
[39:03] tell you what he said to do.
[39:05] And now you put the two together.
[39:07] But he says this, "Listen to what I tell
[39:09] you." And then he gives this very
[39:11] interesting example. So it says now
[39:14] here's a post and I believe he's po
[39:16] pointing to the post there in Brenham
[39:17] Tabernacle. We'll call that a listening
[39:20] post and he says and in it got radio.
[39:24] So it's a he calls this post a listening
[39:27] post and he says there's a radio in the
[39:29] post
[39:30] and he's asking maybe just as by way of
[39:33] just imagine this there's this post this
[39:35] wooden beam and in it there's a radio.
[39:38] He says there's warnings and things can
[39:40] be done like a sword in your hand. Now
[39:43] the post then with a radio he said it's
[39:47] like a sword in your hand. It can pick
[39:48] up for the evil or pick from only as it
[39:51] gets its message. So a sword in your
[39:53] hand could be used wrongly incorrectly
[39:55] but can also be used for good. So this
[39:58] radio in the post can pick up evil or it
[40:02] can pick from only as it gets its
[40:04] message.
[40:07] He's wanting you to listen to this
[40:10] in light of what he's trying to say
[40:12] about not putting your interpretation to
[40:14] anything, but just live a good Christian
[40:17] life. So now for instance to the
[40:19] ordinary man
[40:21] there's been so much cults and clans
[40:23] rise up over little outpourings of the
[40:26] spirit until people gets all worked up
[40:28] in a bunch of stuff go out and start
[40:31] another little move and you know and
[40:32] things
[40:34] you don't want to do that now
[40:38] he recognizes the temptation to want to
[40:41] go out and start movements
[40:44] to get a little bit to be get worked up.
[40:47] Now, if there's a post and it's a
[40:48] listening post and it's like a sword and
[40:50] it could be used for evil or it could
[40:52] just stay in the channel of the message.
[40:53] He's saying there's times when cults and
[40:56] clans and isms rise up around little
[40:58] outpourings of the spirit that get the
[41:00] people worked up. He says don't you know
[41:03] and things he says you don't do that now
[41:07] just remember just stay the way you are
[41:12] and you say well the Lord showed no now
[41:15] just be careful says now look here let
[41:18] me show you something do you know
[41:21] there's 10 thousands of voices in this
[41:23] room right now literally voices of
[41:25] people that's coming through the
[41:26] electronic waves of radio why don't you
[41:28] hear them they are voices
[41:31] Is that right? They're waving right
[41:33] through here. Now, there's people,
[41:35] forms, and bodies moving right through
[41:37] this room. Now, is that right? Now,
[41:40] could we agree with that? that in some
[41:44] dimension, some dimensional space, there
[41:46] are waves right now that's transmitting,
[41:48] if you want to call it data or
[41:49] frequency, transmitting signals that
[41:52] with the proper equipment,
[41:55] you could interpret that or translate
[41:57] that and express what's in those waves.
[42:01] And he said, "They're here now, but we
[42:02] don't see them or hear them." And that's
[42:04] what he's drawn from. He says, "Why
[42:07] don't you?" He says, "Well, they're
[42:08] actually here
[42:11] like my voice." Well, why don't you hear
[42:13] it?
[42:15] It's got to strike something first to
[42:17] reveal it.
[42:21] Put it just put it together as he's
[42:23] saying it. Now, do you understand? So,
[42:26] just don't interpret nothing. If God
[42:29] wants you to know anything, he'll send
[42:31] it to you.
[42:34] Be a listening post.
[42:37] be be be receive the revelation
[42:41] because in order for it to be heard,
[42:45] it's got to strike something first and
[42:47] be revealed.
[42:49] He says he'll send it to you. So just be
[42:52] real, real solid now. Hold still.
[42:56] He says something has happened now. Just
[42:57] be real. You understand what I mean,
[43:00] don't you? Don't try to make yourself
[43:02] odd to be a Christian because you take
[43:05] yourself away from God. If you can
[43:08] understand it, this is that third pull.
[43:11] You should have caught that the other
[43:13] day. So then just remember there'll be
[43:15] no impersonation like there was of the
[43:17] other two. So just as far as you know
[43:20] now, just remember that there's
[43:21] something taking place in this room.
[43:24] There's something here.
[43:26] There's actual in this room's angels,
[43:28] voice of God. But you can't hear the
[43:31] natural voice without something to send
[43:33] it out.
[43:35] So how are you going to hear the
[43:36] spiritual voice?
[43:39] Now you might make believe that
[43:40] somebody's singing this certain song
[43:42] that might not even be here. But when it
[43:45] actually strikes the crystal that it's
[43:47] supposed to strike,
[43:49] then it gives a true interpretation and
[43:51] vindicates it by showing the picture.
[43:55] Do you realize why Brother Brandham's
[43:56] telling you to keep living the life?
[43:58] Stay solid. Be humble. Stay in your
[44:01] lane. Hold still. Because God's wanting
[44:04] to speak something. And he's got to have
[44:06] a crystal to receive it. And then once
[44:08] it strikes the crystal, it can give the
[44:11] true interpretation and vindicate it by
[44:13] showing a picture.
[44:16] See what I mean? He says, "Now the
[44:17] spirit of God, when it speaks through
[44:19] the true word, it vindicates itself to
[44:22] show itself that it's right."
[44:25] He says, "You understand now?
[44:28] And I I guess I would try to remember
[44:30] what he said earlier. No, because you
[44:32] just said none of us get it. So, but
[44:34] he's he's wanting to understand at least
[44:36] where we are. You may not be able to
[44:38] interpret what's going on here right
[44:40] now, but you but you can,
[44:45] right?
[44:46] There's things hidden. There's things
[44:47] unseen. But if you can be a listening
[44:50] post in the right channel,
[44:53] how do you hear that natural voice until
[44:55] it's communicated? How can you hear the
[44:56] spiritual voice until
[44:59] it strikes the crystal that it's
[45:01] supposed to strike?
[45:04] Now, he says, if you can understand it,
[45:05] that this is the third pull. And he
[45:07] keeps coming to back to that in both of
[45:08] these instances. And he says when it
[45:11] speaks
[45:13] through the true word, he's talking
[45:16] about voices. There's voices here that
[45:17] you can't hear, but if it can come
[45:19] through the right channel, you'll hear
[45:21] it. And he says in look away to Jesus.
[45:24] This is when he he's so certain about
[45:26] the third pool. The third pool is
[45:29] properly identified. We know where it
[45:31] is. So the third pool is here. It's so
[45:35] sacred that I mustn't say much about it.
[45:36] So you see how that connects back with
[45:38] some of these things we're be saying. As
[45:39] he told me in the beginning, say nothing
[45:41] of it. You remember that years ago?
[45:44] He says it speaks for itself.
[45:49] these things what he's point it speaks
[45:51] for itself. You don't try to interpret
[45:53] it. You don't try to talk about it. You
[45:56] don't be the one that goes. He said it
[45:58] speaks for itself.
[46:03] That's the third pull.
[46:06] Those are the things that this relates
[46:08] to.
[46:09] Now, we've done so remarkable on time.
[46:12] We may be able to beat the crowd
[46:15] in and out.
[46:18] I think. Yeah, we're doing pretty good.
[46:20] Now, we know Satan hates Revelation. I'm
[46:21] going to try to wrap this up with and
[46:23] just bring something out of harvest
[46:24] time. We know he hates revelation and
[46:28] he's scheming to stop the word of God
[46:30] from being fulfilled. That's what he's
[46:32] trying to do. We see that even here in
[46:34] the seventh seal that if he knew, he
[46:37] could do great damage. There there
[46:39] there's things that he can't know. It's
[46:41] impossible for him to know. But yet
[46:43] there there's he's scheming. He's
[46:44] conniving. He's trying to get in there
[46:47] and and Sunday we read this statement
[46:49] from the harvest time. He says, we'll
[46:51] get into that in a few m minutes on the
[46:54] three temptations of Jesus. The three
[46:57] temptations of Jesus correspond to the
[46:59] three the temptation of the woman in the
[47:01] garden. They correspond to the lust of
[47:03] the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the
[47:04] pride of life. That is all that is in
[47:06] the world. So these are things that we
[47:09] should consider as believers. Here in
[47:11] the harvest time, he said there's three
[47:12] temptations of Jesus.
[47:14] There's three temptations of ministers
[47:16] today where they make their fall.
[47:18] There's three temptations of the church
[47:20] where they make their fall. There's
[47:22] three temptations of an organization
[47:24] where it makes its fall. And there's
[47:26] three temptations in the individuals and
[47:28] where they make their fall.
[47:31] So, we're not just simply looking at
[47:35] elements of holiness, abstaining from
[47:38] the world and legalism and just a a way
[47:41] of trying to present ourselves and
[47:43] express ourselves in such a way to where
[47:45] we we appear a certain way. We appear
[47:47] righteous, we appear holy, but rather
[47:50] there's a goal that a program that God
[47:53] has. Think about a real program, the
[47:55] real thing, the beaten path, something
[47:58] that God's trying to do. completion,
[48:00] full manifestation, the fulfilling of
[48:02] the word of God in the last days to come
[48:04] out into the complete. There's something
[48:05] that God's wanting you to do. So,
[48:07] Satan's temptations are not just to get
[48:09] you to smoke weed. Satan's temptations
[48:11] aren't trying to get you to this. He's
[48:13] not just trying to to to muddy you up.
[48:15] He wants to stop you from fulfilling the
[48:17] word of God.
[48:19] Wants to make it confusing. He wants to
[48:20] try to get you out on a limb somewhere.
[48:22] He's trying to figure out ways to keep
[48:24] the word of God from being fulfilled
[48:26] like he did with the woman, like he did
[48:27] with Christ, like he's doing to the
[48:28] bride right now because the bride will
[48:30] come face to face with the same
[48:32] temptation that Eve faced and that
[48:34] Christ faced and it will be a temptation
[48:37] by the word.
[48:39] Now, Brother Bam says, "Watch when you
[48:40] get to the end where this temptation
[48:43] come." So he's wanting to orient us to
[48:45] things at the end time, how Satan
[48:48] attempts and how he tries to get us to
[48:50] fall through these different
[48:51] temptations. And we know especially in
[48:53] the trial message, brother calls it,
[48:55] he's a blind interpreter of the word
[48:57] always.
[48:58] That's what he is. He's a blind
[49:00] interpreter. So he doesn't see and
[49:02] interpret. He guesses.
[49:04] He tries to figure out. He tries to make
[49:06] sense of it. And we know that he
[49:08] misinterpreted the word to the woman in
[49:10] the beginning. And by misinterpreting
[49:12] the word to the woman in the beginning,
[49:14] he caused a false manifestation of the
[49:16] promise. So what he's trying to do is
[49:18] misinterpret the word so that if you
[49:20] could believe the misinterpretation, you
[49:22] give an impersonation.
[49:24] You give a false manifestation or a
[49:26] false interpretation of the word.
[49:29] I I know that vindication,
[49:31] interpretation, manifestation,
[49:33] revelation, all these things, they might
[49:34] seem to be maybe uh like buzzwords to
[49:37] try to excite an audience, but it's very
[49:39] practical. Satan's wanting to
[49:41] misinterpret the word of God. He's
[49:43] wanting to misconr construe the message
[49:46] or scripture and try to cause it you to
[49:48] accept it in a way to where you
[49:50] demonstrate it falsely
[49:53] that oh this is what the message teacher
[49:54] or this is what Christ would do. This is
[49:56] what the Bible says. By teaching you and
[49:58] misrepresenting the word of God to you,
[50:00] causing you to be arrogant, causing you
[50:02] to be unrighteous, cause you to be
[50:03] hateful or spiteful, jealous, whatever
[50:05] it might be, he's trying to cause you to
[50:08] falsely confess or falsely profess or
[50:11] falsely manifest life
[50:14] because he's a blind interpreter. He
[50:16] doesn't have it to show you. So, he
[50:18] misrepresents it. And if you take the
[50:19] misrepresentation, you can't bring out a
[50:21] right characterization of it.
[50:24] So listen to what he says in harvest
[50:26] time.
[50:28] This is the this is the theme. The theme
[50:30] of harvest time is built around these
[50:31] principles of Satan tempting Christ
[50:36] in misrepresenting the word in offering
[50:39] to him the supernatural since he
[50:41] couldn't get him away from the word.
[50:43] Now think about that.
[50:45] He couldn't get him to deny the word. So
[50:47] he made him a supernatural offer,
[50:50] hoping that in that scheme, he could get
[50:52] him to misinterpret the word
[50:55] by working in a channel that wasn't
[50:57] God's perfect will.
[51:00] So brother Bham says this, "But Jesus
[51:02] said, when the spirit of truth has
[51:03] come," this is from harvest time, "He
[51:06] will bring these things that I've taught
[51:07] you to your memory, the word, and he
[51:09] will also show you things to come."
[51:13] There is the real spiritfilled church
[51:15] now stays with the word reflects the
[51:18] word God on earth.
[51:23] The real spiritfilled church is God on
[51:25] earth.
[51:26] He doesn't need any theologian because
[51:28] his word is of no private
[51:29] interpretation.
[51:32] Now when he says don't try to interpret
[51:34] anything, he's not implying it'll never
[51:37] be interpreted.
[51:38] He's saying that God needs to interpret
[51:40] it.
[51:41] He said it's moving into that cycle. So
[51:42] he said there will never be any
[51:44] interpretation to these things. He's
[51:46] saying man won't interpret it. Don't try
[51:48] to interpret it. Don't try to figure it
[51:50] out. Just keep living the life. So he
[51:52] says about God, he interprets his own
[51:54] word by vindicating it and proving it.
[51:57] It's the truth.
[51:59] And he says when the this part to me is
[52:01] very striking. When the Methodist church
[52:03] told you you couldn't receive the Holy
[52:05] Ghost like they did on the day of
[52:06] Pentecost, did you pay any attention to
[52:08] it? Certainly not. You went right along
[52:11] and got the Holy Ghost anyhow.
[52:13] So, think about the next step.
[52:15] He's preaching this in Phoenix. He's
[52:17] preaching it to the Pentecostals. He's
[52:18] preaching a very direct, specific way.
[52:21] It's very, very pointed. And he he's
[52:23] saying, "Learn from your own example
[52:24] that when the Methodists said you
[52:26] couldn't have the Holy Ghost, couldn't
[52:28] have the restoration of the gifts, did
[52:29] you listen to it?" He said, "No, you
[52:31] went on and got the Holy Ghost anyhow."
[52:34] giving them example of that Leodysian
[52:36] age that time period that time frame
[52:38] what was happening he's saying now God
[52:40] interprets his word by bringing it to
[52:42] pass by vindicating it proving it to be
[52:44] the truth isn't that what God did in
[52:46] your own time
[52:48] now continuing a little bit later he
[52:49] says just as I've told you just as you
[52:52] have to have dead substance there to
[52:54] live by you have to have Christ to live
[52:56] by here to live by here or you die
[53:01] remember the the vegetarian was getting
[53:03] onto him he said, "Man, I used to have a
[53:05] lot of respect for you, Brother Brand,
[53:06] until I found out you ate meat." And you
[53:08] know that that sensitivity, you didn't
[53:09] want something to die. And brother Brand
[53:10] says, "Well, no matter what it is, it
[53:12] has to die.
[53:14] You know, the sentient radish, it's got
[53:16] to die just the same on your salad,
[53:18] right? There's there if there's if
[53:20] there's going to be any substance you're
[53:22] going to get out of it, right?
[53:24] Had to have lived."
[53:26] And he says, "What is Christ?"
[53:30] You have to live by Christ. And he says,
[53:32] "What is Christ?" In the beginning was
[53:33] the word and the word was with God and
[53:36] the word was God and the word was made
[53:39] flesh and dwelt among us. And you are
[53:42] the same written epistle, one for one
[53:45] age and one for another for the light of
[53:48] that hour, but they failed to see it.
[53:50] You reflect it only.
[53:53] So here you are reflecting it. God on
[53:57] earth, he said he doesn't God doesn't
[54:00] need a man to interpret it. He
[54:01] interprets his own word by vindicating
[54:03] it himself. And he says, "Now you are a
[54:06] written epistle to reflect the light of
[54:09] that hour." Same sermon. He says, "And
[54:10] I've said God don't need no interpreter.
[54:12] He interprets every word himself. You
[54:15] don't need somebody to interpret it to
[54:17] you. God interprets it to you when
[54:20] you're willing to accept it. That's the
[54:22] life. That's life itself.
[54:27] I'm reading these things so you could
[54:29] understand." And I realize that I wish I
[54:31] had more time and we'll just have to
[54:32] amplify this uh kind of bring some of
[54:34] these things out more together at a
[54:36] later time. But notice how some of these
[54:38] things that seem to be the real kernel,
[54:40] these real deep things about the the the
[54:42] light of the hour, you being a
[54:44] reflection of it a and the word being
[54:46] made manifest, the word being
[54:48] interpreted. And he says God wants to
[54:50] interpret it to you if you're willing to
[54:52] accept it. And then through the
[54:53] interpretation, he says that's life
[54:56] itself. Amen.
[54:57] That's God interpreting it. Right now,
[55:00] there's voices going through this room.
[55:02] Right now, the voice of God is here.
[55:04] Right now, God himself is here, but it's
[55:06] got to strike something first in order
[55:08] to reveal it in order to give the
[55:10] understanding of it so it can be lived.
[55:14] He said that's the life. That's life
[55:15] itself.
[55:17] So, he comes to this statement which is
[55:20] the the very very uh uh we see this
[55:24] quite frequently. And in that day, Luke
[55:27] 17:30, when the son of man is being
[55:29] revealed, this is harvest time, not man,
[55:31] the son of man, not an organization, the
[55:33] son of man, the word itself again,
[55:37] excuse me, the word living itself again
[55:40] among the people. The word itself made
[55:43] flesh in you.
[55:47] The to teach the message is not a
[55:49] history class.
[55:51] It's a future class. That's right.
[55:54] He says it's the message in you. You are
[55:58] a reflection of the this hour. The
[56:01] message reflection of it. Go back to
[56:04] what he was saying in question and
[56:05] answers the listening post the crystal.
[56:08] Think about how things are Satan can't
[56:10] interpret it. He can't make it out. He
[56:12] says you live again. Live the life that
[56:14] was in Jesus Christ. You're in the
[56:16] presence of the son. He said then what
[56:19] happens? What happens to that church?
[56:20] Finally, listen. The shuck pulls away
[56:22] from the wheat. When it begins to be
[56:24] manifested, what happened? The life that
[56:26] was in the shuck went out into the
[56:27] wheat. The life won't change. The
[56:30] carriers change. They denominate the
[56:32] blades, the tassel, the shuck. But the
[56:34] wheat can't change. It's got to be a
[56:36] ministry just exactly on the word like
[56:38] he was on the word and like the first
[56:40] church was on the word. Spiritfilled,
[56:43] wordfed, not denominational fed.
[56:46] Wordfed.
[56:48] Harvest time. When the grain has come to
[56:51] maturity where you can eat it,
[56:53] it can be enjoyed. It can it can be used
[56:56] for the purpose that it was sewn into
[56:58] the ground for. At any of those other
[57:00] stages, it's not complete yet.
[57:02] At any of those other stages, it hasn't
[57:03] come to its purpose. No matter how much
[57:05] it shimmerred, no matter how much it
[57:06] manifested, no matter how much life was
[57:08] in it, when it comes to the grain, it
[57:09] comes to the seven. It comes to the
[57:11] completion. It comes to the fullness.
[57:13] Amen.
[57:14] And he says spiritfed, excuse me,
[57:16] spiritfilled and word fed.
[57:21] We That's a word you've got to feed on.
[57:25] And what is it that happens in
[57:26] Revelations 10:es 10 and 11? I took the
[57:29] book out of the angel's hand and ate it
[57:31] up. And it says, "And when I ate it, it
[57:33] was sweet in my mouth, bitter in my
[57:35] belly."
[57:37] He had to take the book and eat it.
[57:38] There's so much s rich symbolism in
[57:40] this. The seven thunders
[57:44] are it's they're revealed in this open
[57:46] book. This is the complete plan of
[57:48] redemption. This is this is the the
[57:52] mystery of Christ. And then once he's
[57:54] eaten the book and we don't we wouldn't
[57:57] know. We're not let's just say we're
[57:59] watching John eat the book. I think they
[58:02] have a lot of uh things they do these
[58:04] days, a lot of memes where you're
[58:05] supposed to eat something and keep a
[58:06] straight face or maybe drink a 2 liter
[58:08] of Dr. Pepper and not burp. all the
[58:10] different games the kids play these
[58:12] days. And so maybe John could have eaten
[58:14] it and just sat there stonefaced.
[58:18] Like, well, was it sweet? Was it bitter?
[58:21] Only he would know
[58:23] what it tasted like. Only he knew what
[58:26] it felt like. But then in verse 11, he
[58:29] said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again
[58:33] before many peoples and nations and
[58:34] tongues and kings."
[58:37] Thou must prophesy again. This
[58:41] prophesying again is connected to the
[58:44] contents of the book. It's
[58:46] connected to this this symbolic taking
[58:49] of the book and eating it and the
[58:51] sweetness in his mouth but the
[58:52] bitterness in his belly. These things
[58:54] are being represented to us in a way to
[58:56] where uh uh this is something that has
[58:59] to transpire. Something unfolds and he
[59:01] says thou must prophesy again then
[59:04] before many peoples, nations, tongues
[59:05] and kings. In other words, this this
[59:08] book which has been eaten that was sweet
[59:10] in your mouth and bitter in your belly,
[59:12] now you that has tasted it, you that has
[59:16] felt the effects of it, you have got to
[59:18] prophesy it.
[59:20] And in feast of the trumpets, brother
[59:21] Brandon refers to Malachi 4 and he says
[59:24] in Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ the same
[59:26] yesterday, today, and forever. He
[59:28] remains forever the word, the word made
[59:30] manifest. That's exactly what he
[59:33] declared. the pro prophets.
[59:35] A prophet doesn't mean a only mean a
[59:38] seer or foreteller.
[59:41] It means a revealer of the word that's
[59:43] written
[59:44] in his own life, his own works reveals
[59:48] and vindicates the word of that day.
[59:50] Like Noah building the ark, Moses down
[59:52] there, whatever more any promise, the
[59:54] promised word of that hour. So what is
[59:56] it that we're doing when we prophesy?
[59:58] Again, we're not trying to foretell the
[1:00:01] truth. We're not trying to predict what
[1:00:03] will happen. We're not trying to figure
[1:00:05] out what has been. But when we are
[1:00:07] foretellers, when we are prophesying
[1:00:09] again, then we reveal the word that's
[1:00:13] written by our own lives, by our own
[1:00:16] works. It reveals and vindicates the
[1:00:18] word of this day. Amen.
[1:00:21] Just like Noah building the ark. The
[1:00:23] ark,
[1:00:24] Noah's works and his product was a
[1:00:26] manifestation of the secret revelation
[1:00:28] that God told him it's going to rain to
[1:00:30] build an ark.
[1:00:32] Same with Moses. And same for us who
[1:00:35] must prophesy again. The bride's going
[1:00:37] to be the final voice to the final age.
[1:00:39] And we all want to get in line so we
[1:00:40] could stand on a platform say, "Thus
[1:00:42] sayaith the Lord." How about you just
[1:00:44] live it?
[1:00:47] You get into the harvest time. to
[1:00:49] hopefully touch on this soon.
[1:00:52] Brother Brandham is identifying Satan's
[1:00:54] schemes and how so much of it is caught
[1:00:57] up in people missing it because of all
[1:01:00] the fantastic.
[1:01:02] And one of the earmarks of missing it is
[1:01:04] false prophecy.
[1:01:07] One of the earmarks of missing missing
[1:01:10] this is false prophecy.
[1:01:13] When someone says, "Well, you've got
[1:01:14] this problem." I could point some people
[1:01:16] who are tired tonight.
[1:01:19] I had my neighbor, he's a pastor, Bill.
[1:01:22] He was he started a church in in LA. He
[1:01:25] pastored there for 40 years. He's
[1:01:26] retired and just become a such a good
[1:01:28] friend. He texted me last night because
[1:01:30] the Texas Rangers are playing the Los
[1:01:31] Angeles Dodgers. His teams are the
[1:01:32] Dodgers. He text me right at game time
[1:01:34] and said, "God told me the Dodgers five,
[1:01:36] the Rangers won."
[1:01:39] So by the time I had a chance to check
[1:01:40] the score, it was three to one Dodgers.
[1:01:42] And I'm like, "You're looking like a
[1:01:44] prophet right now." And he wrote back
[1:01:46] after the Dodgers had scored six runs.
[1:01:49] And said, "I'm always 100% because God
[1:01:51] sometimes changes his mind."
[1:01:54] And I just laughed and said, "I love
[1:01:56] it." You know, because God changes his
[1:01:58] mind, but not about his word.
[1:02:01] And there's such a slippery thing where
[1:02:03] people will prophesy and say things in
[1:02:05] the name of the Lord and it never
[1:02:06] happens.
[1:02:08] Brother Bam said this is one of the
[1:02:09] things that distracts people. This is
[1:02:10] one of the schemes he uses to get
[1:02:11] everybody caught up. And this is why he
[1:02:12] says, "Don't become cultish. Don't get
[1:02:14] started up in another movement.
[1:02:17] Don't try to become something we're not.
[1:02:19] Stay with the simple message."
[1:02:23] To prophesy again is to reveal the word
[1:02:25] that's written.
[1:02:28] Even that word which you are a written
[1:02:30] epistle of.
[1:02:33] For the bride to prophesy again, we have
[1:02:35] to reveal the word that's written. The
[1:02:37] light has to strike something first to
[1:02:40] reveal it.
[1:02:43] The light has to strike the word to
[1:02:46] reveal it.
[1:02:48] And it's not I I almost feel like it's
[1:02:51] like now now I could repreach it all and
[1:02:52] it might make more sense.
[1:02:59] But when God reveals something in your
[1:03:00] heart
[1:03:02] and you know it's him,
[1:03:05] you don't have to say anything about it.
[1:03:09] You just prophesy it
[1:03:12] in your life
[1:03:14] by your works
[1:03:15] and that will reveal and vindicate the
[1:03:17] word for this day.
[1:03:19] The brothers could come to their
[1:03:20] instruments. I'm going to end up in a
[1:03:22] spot that I think is so obvious. Brother
[1:03:24] Brand when he's preaching Revelation
[1:03:25] chapter 4 part 3, he's preaching the
[1:03:27] throne of mercy. This is in the
[1:03:28] revelation of Jesus Christ series that
[1:03:30] he preaches in ' 61. He said, "Everybody
[1:03:32] can't be a preacher." Brother Philip
[1:03:35] might say, "Preacher, what's a
[1:03:37] preacher?" He said, "But if you can't
[1:03:39] preach the people a sermon," he says,
[1:03:42] "If you're a preacher, you're called to
[1:03:43] the pulpit to preach." And so that's
[1:03:45] what I've done tonight. He says, "If
[1:03:47] you're not, you're still a preacher.
[1:03:50] But live the people a sermon.
[1:03:53] Let your sermon be lived.
[1:03:55] And it's the voice of God that'll bring
[1:03:58] reproach to them who reject it. They
[1:04:00] say, "No one could have put a finger on
[1:04:02] his life or her life. They're sweet
[1:04:04] living. If there ever was a man of God,
[1:04:06] it's that man or that woman." He says,
[1:04:08] "Live your sermons. Don't try to preach
[1:04:11] them. If you're not called to be a
[1:04:13] preacher, you get all mixed up anyhow
[1:04:15] and messed up and you get people tangled
[1:04:18] up and you know well you'll ruin them
[1:04:22] and yourself too. Just live your sermon.
[1:04:26] It's not the right. It's not your
[1:04:29] tongues. It's not your talking. It's not
[1:04:30] your speaking. He says when you do that,
[1:04:33] he says you get it all mixed up. You get
[1:04:34] it tangled up. You'll ruin them and
[1:04:36] yourself too. He said just live your
[1:04:38] sermon.
[1:04:39] The preacher's called to preach his and
[1:04:42] to live it, too. If he can't live it,
[1:04:46] then stop preaching it.
[1:04:49] You can amen louder.
[1:04:51] You can say amen to that. If the
[1:04:53] preacher, he has to preach it, but he's
[1:04:56] called to live it, too. And if he can't
[1:04:58] live it, then stop preaching it. And it
[1:05:00] seems sometimes if he can't live it, he
[1:05:02] just preaches it harder.
[1:05:07] But you're supposed to live your
[1:05:09] sermons. All right. Here were voices.
[1:05:13] Remember how when he's preaching
[1:05:15] question and answers on the seals,
[1:05:16] there's voices,
[1:05:18] hidden voices.
[1:05:21] There's a program of God. Hold steady.
[1:05:23] Gets to the harvest time. He starts
[1:05:25] bringing some of these things out. Feast
[1:05:26] of the trumpet. He starts bringing these
[1:05:27] things out in clear detail. But here
[1:05:28] he's saying this. There's voices. Oh,
[1:05:31] what we need in Jeffersonville.
[1:05:33] Thousands of lived voices.
[1:05:36] The thunder of God thundering out in
[1:05:38] sweetness and holiness, purity,
[1:05:39] undefiled lives, walking around the
[1:05:42] earth today without blemish. I didn't
[1:05:43] count. It might be seven. I don't know.
[1:05:46] But this is what we need. The thunder of
[1:05:48] God thundering out in sweetness,
[1:05:49] holiness, purity, undefiled lives.
[1:05:51] Walking around the earth today without a
[1:05:52] blemish. Yes, sir. Real Christians,
[1:05:55] that's thunder against the enemy.
[1:05:57] Amen.
[1:05:58] The devil don't care how loud you can
[1:05:59] holler. The devil don't care how much
[1:06:02] you can jump or how much you can do this
[1:06:04] or shout. But what hurts the devil is to
[1:06:06] see that sanctified holy life
[1:06:09] consecrated to God.
[1:06:11] Say anything to him, call him anything,
[1:06:13] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:06:14] right on. That throws him away. That's
[1:06:16] the thunder that shakes the devil.
[1:06:20] That's the it is written in this hour.
[1:06:22] We're not continuing with the devil face
[1:06:24] to face having a conversation with him
[1:06:27] in the same way that the woman did in
[1:06:28] the garden. We're not contending with
[1:06:30] the devil face to face in the same way
[1:06:32] that Jesus did in the wilderness where
[1:06:34] they had a conversation and the woman
[1:06:36] could have said it is written we shall
[1:06:37] not eat of every tree in the midst of
[1:06:39] the garden and left it there. But Satan
[1:06:41] followed it up and she could have stayed
[1:06:43] with it was written. When Satan used his
[1:06:45] scheme on Jesus, he said command these
[1:06:47] stones to be made bread. And he said it
[1:06:49] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:06:51] alone but by every word he has to live
[1:06:53] and he can only have life by every word
[1:06:56] that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[1:06:58] And it shut Satan up.
[1:06:59] Amen.
[1:07:00] So he said, "Oh, I can't shake him from
[1:07:01] the word. So I'll quote the word to him
[1:07:05] and I'll entice him to do something
[1:07:07] supernatural
[1:07:09] and I'll bait him into something." And
[1:07:12] Jesus stood there and said, "It is
[1:07:15] written."
[1:07:17] And then once again, he comes back to it
[1:07:19] the third time. It is written. And the
[1:07:23] final voice to the final age. It's not
[1:07:26] us using our lips to constantly say it
[1:07:28] is written. Well, you know the message
[1:07:29] says not to do that and you know the the
[1:07:30] Bible says not to do this. It's it's not
[1:07:32] in that. It's in living the life.
[1:07:35] The living the life is the response. It
[1:07:39] is written
[1:07:40] because you become the interpretation of
[1:07:42] it is written. You become the
[1:07:44] manifestation of it is written.
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:51] That's the thunder now.
[1:07:54] That's the thunder that shakes the
[1:07:55] devil.
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:00] This is the simple life.
[1:08:04] This is the life we ought to live.
[1:08:06] Living it in sweetness and
[1:08:08] sanctification and holiness, a
[1:08:10] consecrated life. Well, why would he?
[1:08:13] Now, this is where I'm This is where I'm
[1:08:14] tracking. Now, why why would he attack
[1:08:17] us?
[1:08:19] Why would he try to confuse us on a
[1:08:21] promise? Not because we would believe
[1:08:23] the wrong thing alone,
[1:08:26] but if we don't see the right thing, we
[1:08:28] can't be the right thing. So his scheme,
[1:08:31] his goal at the end of the day is to
[1:08:33] keep the word from being fulfilled. So
[1:08:34] he wants to confuse you on the promise
[1:08:36] somewhere in it so that it's not
[1:08:38] fulfilled. So what he's trying to do is
[1:08:39] find some way to tempt us to the three
[1:08:41] three temptations so that the word of
[1:08:43] God isn't being manifested.
[1:08:45] Because the power of a manifested life,
[1:08:47] it's going to be the salvation for
[1:08:49] people. They're going to see your life
[1:08:52] and they're going to want to come to
[1:08:53] Christ.
[1:08:54] Not in the explanation of it, but in the
[1:08:57] holiness, being undefiled, living those
[1:09:00] pure lives. That's the thunder. That's
[1:09:02] the it is written against the enemy in
[1:09:05] this hour. Could we pray together as you
[1:09:07] stand to your
