TRANSCRIPT
========================================
exodus chapter 12 verses 1 to 6 exodus chapter 12 verses 1 to 6 is where i'd like to read this evening there are so many things transpiring and taking place so many different needs in the body of christ i apologize if i seem a little bit scattered this evening and hope i didn't miss anything but exodus chapter 12 verse 1 and we're continuing on the series on christmas this may seem to be a little bit of a strange uh strange scripture to use but why it has so much relevance to christmas and this in your bible it might mention it and the heading mind says the passover instituted by god and that's in and then in chapter 13 they're actually remembering the passover and following it but this is where it's the commandment is given and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of month so their calendar resets this is their first of the year it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take no take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb foreign house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening amen god bless you you can have your seats as we're continuing on the subject of christmas and in particular we spent three services looking at myths related to christmas and covered a lot of ground and we've appreciated the feedback that we've got from you um even in ways of it being challenging or just how in particular ways god has been speaking to you how relevant it's been i've even appreciated the the feedback that has come maybe from a place of concern and wondering um whether or not someone is doing it right and i have heard from some that have kind of wanted to know my position on certain things and uh as we mentioned before as a church we don't take any particular position on some of the things that we've spoken about because we believe it ought to be up to you as pastors of your own home your husbands as wives and assistant to the pastor there in your home to kind of lead and to guide and make the right kind of decisions for your family because you would know best where we see things in the word of god very plainly we take those positions we preach those things as a church but there's some things that we rather leave to the individual leadership of the holy spirit in people's lives and so you looked at a lot of different myths and i don't want to go back over them tonight so you can breathe your sigh of relief now but i want to just kind of jump in the one that we were kind of looking at at the end of sunday and it was related to the date that is commonly celebrated of christmas december 25th and one of the things that we're kind of pointing out i'll put in these terms maybe now one of the great mysteries about christmas is when was the exact date that jesus was born and i will say having turned myself into a mini historian over the last couple months history has done a tremendous job of complicating or at least obscuring the truth of christ's birth there's a lot of things that just seem to obscure and confuse even finding where there's um some academic dishonesty and there's actually some very i think overt ways that people have tried to obscure and convolute the truth of when christ was born by putting out their false narratives and false sources and different things and one of the things that we saw is that there's many justifications for december 25th being the date of christ's birth and even many different calculations for arriving at that time period that aren't necessarily pagan it's not that they said well this is when jupiter was born or this is not everyone is pointing to that time period to calculate when christ was born but there's a lot of religious and theological debates surrounding it to affix december 25th as the date of christ's birth but even then even though there might not be on everyone's hands this fault of trying to align things with paganism there has been an intentional blending of secular feasts secular traditions pagan traditions pagan worship with this date and this time very intentional so things are kind of lined up together with some of these things that we recognize as pagan and has a symmetry with babylon and it's important to recognize those things and as i've studied and i'm sure you're aware of and you've experienced yourself there's debates on every single aspect of the birth of christ whether it be the month the week the day the time of day and even debates as to whether or not what the word in means does it mean a part of a house and they debate the sizes of houses in bethlehem during that time period they debate whether or not it was in a stable there's great theological debates about the fact that it was actually in a cave not a stable it was in the side of a cliff it was here it was there and there's debates that rage over every single one of these aspects even down to whether or not it was actually a manger uh there's debates as to what was real what it represented and what it actually was so there's we could spend all of 2022 preaching about christmas myths and not even scratch the surface because everyone has spent time trying to figure out what all these elements are and i believe there's a truth to each one of these elements and i believe that there are representations and types and symbolisms contained in each one otherwise i don't i think that god would have left them unrecorded if there wasn't some some meaning in these things and we found that as we've studied the bible whether it be in the book of ruth or in the story of abraham that god shared details with us because it could convey certain truths to us and i i as i've looked this i looked at this i felt that god has allowed the date of jesus christ the date of his birth to be shrouded in mystery for a reason that it's not just perfectly conclusive yep it was december 25th it was nine o'clock in the evening and it was at such and such location there's certain things that just seem to be kind of lost or even as some writers have said is that the writer of the bible being god himself as he inspired the writers didn't give us specifics so and that the early church didn't even concern themselves with it but yet god has allowed it to be mysterious and not conclusive and i found one of the ancient writers or maybe one of the mid mid century writers maybe in the the mental ages wrote this there's a catalog of no less than 136 different opinions concerning the year of christ's birth and as to his birth day that has been placed by christian sex and learned men in every month of the year so if you want to study it you'll find that you just pick your birth month whatever it is you'll find some religion some christianity sect that believes christ was born in this particular month 136 different opinions as to the year and then a as to his birthday there's a there's some idea somewhere that'll represent in any particular month of the 12 months of the year but brother branham mentioned two different quotes we want to read that we read at the end on sunday he says i do not believe jesus would care what day you worshipped his birthday on if it's the 25th 26th or whatever if it's it's may april may june july or whenever it might be just so you worship him on any day i take that to uh to mean that he wouldn't want you just to fix a particular day to worship him just so that you would worship him on that day but rather if you don't uh venerate before just one particular day maybe you consecrate yourself every day instead of just finding one day that you recognize the birth of christ maybe you go you go every day you do that and what's happened by being able to fix a date of when christ was born and then also fix a date to when christ was crucified or resurrected and and these dates begin to have this preeminence within christianity what has become the traditional days that people attend church when they don't the rest of the year christmas and easter and so truly we can say that jesus wouldn't care that you worshipped him on any particular date just so that you had a day to worship him but my words now would be that he would want you to worship him every day and then god's gifts always find their places as brother branham was talking about how paganism was blended in with christianity he says and they made it the son of god his birthday the date of the sun god's birthday and he says but what difference does it make even if they was doing it in july or august or whenever it might be it's still the sacredness of remembering that god gave us the hope that we have in us so we do not believe that jesus would care what day you worshipped on just so you'd have a day to worship him and he says but what difference does it make what difference does it make whether it's in july or august or any particular day he says it's still something sacred and he made the statement it's not a pagan celebration to us and i think there was a lot of the quotes that i shared on sunday conveyed brother branham's identifying the pagan origins and even some of the pagan stains that are attached to the christmas celebration and and maybe some of the feedback i got is that was real that was real heavy you know it was real uh real hard and um i rested in the fact that i was it was it wasn't me i was quoting it and i think it's important that we know what's said even if it even if it rubs against maybe our opinions the way we've got everything figured out in the message sometimes it's worth it to go back and revisit what was actually said uh to be balanced by those things and let them inform us i think it's important that we as a church be listening to the voice of god and listening to the sermons that we have available to us now if we could look again at luke chapter 2 verses 7 and 8 this scripture we used last time and i think it's a um it describes this scene as there is a description of what's taking place here at the time of the birth of christ and the specific moments when he's born and it says in luke chapter 2 verses 7 and 8 as we have already read that he she was there was no uh we're going to see here there's no room for him at the end so it kind of gives this setting and she brought forth her first born son kind of a very neat and very clean description of a baby being born she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes even that holds some symbolism and laid him in a manger that holds some symbolism because there was no room for them in the inn and that is uh that is the description of the birth of jesus christ and then immediately it brings us to this scene and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and by positioning this description right after the birth of christ i believe that the scriptures are wanting to convey to us that christ was born in this time that it would have been in this evening time or this passing of the setting of the sun and it says they're keeping watch over their flock by nights would have been a particular watch um that these shepherds would have been uh in the field with the sheep as it's very this language is used and i believe that that this verse alone verse 8 being used right at the moment in the time that christ is born holds details that are relevant about the birth of christ and and to his purpose and there's things that we can gather from this and and i know if it seems like i've been hiding the ball and i haven't emphasized this enough tonight i'm really going to emphasize it for people who've been waiting maybe for some of these things but we do not believe that jesus christ was born on december 25th i do not believe that i do not believe that we are taught that we are not taught that jesus christ was born on december 25th we do not see and we are not taught that he was born in the fall or in the winter times we're not just kind of moving it by a few weeks we do not believe that he was born during this that time or even this time and if it's worth mentioning that we do not believe that determining the specific day or even the specific year of his birth is necessary for salvation that we we have to know the date he was born at the time he was born or that if someone was i really think it was in december that that's going to be some sort of leaven that's going to stare and keep them from receiving the holy ghost and we do not believe that affixing a date and a time and accepting that and agreeing to it is necessary for proper worship if there was be a a segment of believers that held that it was may 12th that christ was born and another one september 11th and they really head to it and they they celebrated christmas during that time then um that's it's not necessary to have those dates and those times and those traditions to worship god that we could you could have those beliefs but don't let those beliefs keep you from worshiping because those things aren't necessary to worship him in spirit and in truth i i came across this statement in a very old commentary it is sufficient for us to know that he was born was made flesh and dwelt among us assumed our nature and in consequence thereof is become an all-sufficient savior and redeemer and whomsoever believeth with the right faith shall not perish but have eternal life that is what is sufficient not that we believe he was born on this day or that day but that we believe that he was born was made flesh and dwelt among us and that he and these things these are the things that we believe now having said that in saying that we do not believe he was born in christmas the scriptures point out born to born at december 25th during this time scriptures point out these particular scriptures point out certain details that specify a particular season by reading this it's kind of i want to say uses the word clues but it's kind of zeroing in on a time period and though it may be a broad time period even the broad time period would rule out this fall time or this winter time that many people believe christ was born and it's the it's kind of this phrase i'll summarize summarize it this way at the time that christ is born there are shepherds in the field keeping flock but their flock at night and so this would point us to a specific time of year and by its wording and by its imagery it's likely not the winter now there's been those that have witnessed and even i think there's uh maybe some well-known writings within certain circles of how people have been in judea during this time of year and observed uh shepherds in the field with their sheep and so there's always a there's always like maybe a counter narrative there's always some some outlier something that's different but really this idea that this is this time of year that the shepherds would be keeping their flock at night would not be the winter is not really a a a mystery to a lot of people who read their bibles and study the bible i'm going to read from i think six different commentaries many of them very old from hundreds of years even to more modern commentaries and this is the conclusion that they made by reading these scriptures here's one it says on this very ground luke 7 chapter 2 verse 8 on this very ground the nativity in december should be given up the feeding of the flocks by night in the fields is a chronological fact which casts considerable light upon this disputed point so i'm saying the very fact that this verse should cause us to abandon the idea that christ was born in december another another commentary it is not likely that he was born as is commonly received at the latter end of december in the depth of winter another one for this it seems plain that the period of the year usually assigned to our lord's birth is too late just based upon this verse alone they're saying these ver this verse alone kind of clues us in that you know what probably wasn't born on december 25th it said shepherds and their flocks would not be found abiding this is another one abiding in the open fields at night in december for the paramount reason that there would be no pastorage at that time and then another one as it is not probable that they expose their flocks to the coldness of winter nights and that climate may be strongly argued from this circumstance that those who have fixed upon december for the birth of christ have been mistaken in the time of it and so there's a lot of a lot of others that would agree to this point and see this and boy i'm telling you there's a there's stacks of research that people put into this and analyzing weather patterns and a lot of different things that are used to identify this so there's a lot of people that have realized that the bible is kind of telling us it probably wasn't december and what time what time we believe it would be and with this is as believers we have this uh we know in our hearts we'll get to some of these statements here in a moment of the specific time it would be but as it says they were these shepherds were in abiding in the field keeping watch on their flock by night it's pointing to the spring season in particular the lambing season when lambs are born and and i went just found uh visited some farms that uh that have sheep farms and they breed sheep and i found that the best time um for them to to breed is in the fall and the best time for them to be born based upon their gestation period for when they when they breed is in the spring and there's over and over again i found secular websites not pagan one secular websites that talked about how the best time for lambs to be born is in the is in this season because it's where there's mild weather and there's an abundance of very really good uh grass and green grass for the for these lambs to feed upon and so it's very important this would be an important time for lambs to be born and i believe that's kind of what the lord is signaling it says she brought forth their firstborn and at the same time in the same country there's shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and brother branham in this sermon why it had to be shepherd and some of you probably have noticed how it's not shepherds but it's singular why it had to be shepherd it's very interesting wouldn't it be nice to know why he said shepherd amen okay yeah i don't know it's interesting isn't it we just would speculate we are approaching christmas the streets are crowded with men and women boys and girls pushing shoving trying to buy a present to return to somebody who would give them likewise right i bought you this hoping that maybe you'd give me something similar in return or at least spend just as much as i did i kept the price tag on it so you wouldn't cheap out this year and buy me a five dollar gift when i'm just giving you a hundred and five dollar gift it's kind of identifying really what takes place anymore many people call themselves christians are on the streets buying cigarettes remember happy to holidays happy smoking he says on the streets buying cigarettes liquor for christmas presents and he's praying this prayer he says god it looks like they're throwing it right back in your face teaching their children of some fiction roman pagan theology of a saint nicholas some myth that's easy accepted by the world now just think about that it's taught that way because it's easier to accept he says and they turn down the real christ of christmas the real lamb the real christ of christmas he identifies that what they're turning down and all the frivolity and everything that it's become what they're turning down is the christ of christmas and the christ of christmas is personified here in the language he's using as the real lamb now pondered this and i realized tonight that it's a it's a real safe area for amen because i'm not preaching anything that's deep and mysterious to us but part of the mystery the messiah's first coming was that he would be a sacrificial lamb and again we emphasize this quite a bit that was unexpected to everyone they were not looking in mangers to see the messiah they were they were not looking in these they were not looking even in cribs for the messiah they were expecting that the messiah would make himself known in some regal way some powerful way and some stature that would declare this is a man of royalty this is a man of power this is a man with political influence as we identified quite often that the jews thought that this would be a king that would gather all nations together such a powerful ruler and a powerful leader that under his leadership and rulership all the gentiles and the whole world would be dwelled together in peace and that they would come to his light and they would all gather to israel saying you are the example of civilization and and the way a country should be run and so here he comes and he comes in this stable he's born wrapped in swaddling clothes laid in a manger in the maybe in a cave not in a home and not anywhere you would expect maybe a king to be born but yet he's in these circumstances the lamb comes forth and this is part of the mystery of his first coming is he's a sacrificial lamb so think about it it's his birth that hides him that had he had a different birth maybe people would start thinking and wondering and if he was born into particular family under different circumstances maybe others would wonder but it's his birth that hides them and it's not until it's not until the the wise men give some sort of indication that herod that hey there's the king of the jews that the king has been born that motivates him to kill um of the children two and under in this particular region uh to to settle it to deal with it maybe if he just said went out place by place that night because well he's going to be born this night going on this night they made it may have never considered that location but as we think about it that the circumstances of his birth hide him and i love this thought because god hides himself in simplicity and so many truths of the word of god are hid in simplicity hid behind the circumstances the reproach of it oh well that would be illegitimate and oh what about this and oh what about that and a lot of stigma and things are placed a lot of scarlet letters are placed on things because of its simplicity and lies that are told about it but it's his birth the circumstances of his birth that hide him but those very same circumstances that hide him also reveal him because where he's hid that's where he's found and so he hides himself in simplicity so if god hides himself in simplicity and we're like god we're playing hide and seek with god so we're trying to find god don't go trying to find him somewhere other than simplicity because he hides in simplicity if he hides in simplicity that's where you're going to find him and so he's hid himself in this birth and then he reveals himself in it too something about his character about his purpose about what he's going to do is in is actually in his birth and so the scriptures and i'm just going to use a few tonight at key intervals or pointing to christ coming as a lamb i'm just going to use a few tonight but there's many different things in the word of god that are pointing to this that he would come and remember these scriptures are pointing forward to his coming as a lamb in isaiah chapter 53 verse 7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth this is a prophecy of jesus christ this is a prophecy that he would come meek and lowly that he's going to come despised and rejected a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and it's painting the picture of the messiah very differently than what those in judea would expect him to come as in its time and in its season but here he's described as a lamb coming to the slaughter so when christ is born and he's come to the age around his 30th birthday it's time for him to be baptized and he's going to be coming to john to be baptized and john is the forerunner he declares this on john 1 29 the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and notice this inspired utterance and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world now to take away sins is just going to bring you right to this idea and what was foreshadowed in the sacrifice is that blood was shed to deal with sins it was a covering upon the altar to atone for sins so he says here's the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he's actually using a language that pointed back to all the sacrifices that were pointing forward to the coming of the messiah and john is specifically saying that this messiah who is amongst us now is the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world and i think it's the next day he's talking to his disciples again and he sees jesus and he says it again in verse 36 behold the lamb of god that that behold the lamb of god he's still declaring it this is the characterization that the forerunner this is the this is the language the descriptive language this is the title this is these are the symbols this is the ministry that he affixes to christ the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world this is the this is the nature of his coming as the messiah and then peter he picks it up in first peter chapter nine excuse me chapter nine wow that's the different translation get the nine chapters in the book of peter first peter chapter one verse verse 19 you also find it in revelations 5 revelation 22 a few other places in revelation where it's the lamb it's the lamb it's the lamb all right he's identified at this scene in revelations 5 around the throne he's seen it later that he's in that city on the throne of god here's the lamb so this character of christ and the messiah being a lamb is something that's hid in the old testament but since he came as a lamb it's almost as if it pops out in 3d now and we see this and so peter says now in first peter chapter 1 verse 19 but with the precious blood of jesus christ notice this beautiful language as of a lamb without blemish and without spot now this would be very important to a hebrew because they knew that the particular sacrifice when the lamb was offered had to be without blemish had to be perfect had to be without spot even when it came to the offering of a heifer it had to be perfect it had to be without blemish there couldn't be any birth defects and so here he's describing christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot and i could have used four or five different scriptures just immediately tonight of how he knew no sin he was without sin the scripture over and over and over again is reminding us that christ was without sin so he's in the image of a spotless lamb and when he spoke at thunder that he's in the image of the lamb who's without sin just give it a moment it just it gets unsettled about this time every wednesday night maybe we cycled through it there's we think it's maybe just radio interference but uh maybe it's devil interference the pagans are up to something again but you'll find different places where he's referred to as being spotless and sinless why to put him in this image of what he fulfilled the foreshadowing the type of a sacrifice and a lamb who's without blemish and without spot a sinless innocent lamb which we recognize is the image in genesis 3 right it's even the image that's in genesis 4. you're like wow this this image and we've covered these in this past year this image is very strong in the scriptures of this sacrificial lamb and this covering and the blood that is shed and so there's a lot that we could use in this vein and i felt very comfortable today backing out a lot of the different scriptures i had because i wanted to make a little bit more progress in this now notice some of these statements that brother brandon makes and this is certainly not exhaustive on this particular subject and the world is again falling apart he says we celebrate this 25th day of december for the birthday of christ but of course anyone knows that it wasn't christ's birthday that was the roman sun god's birthday that when the church was converted into or brought into catholicism was formed at the council of nicaea and skipped a little bit and it was the sun god's birthday and they just taken the son of god and made that his birthday to blend it in with their pagan tradition and it no means at all being christ's birthday he could not been born at that time because judea is about the same high up on the equator as this is we find out that in judea in the winter time 25th of december she's blizzardly and cold and she can be there can be snow during this time shepherds cannot be on the hill and many reasons that it couldn't be a lot of historical things that point to travel would have been restricted during this time just in general the very fact that i look to it says they're calling the people to be taxed they speculate this this would not have been a good time if you're taxing people don't do it at the time where it's the hardest to travel when the roads would be impassable there'd be a lot of rain or snow or inclement weather that would keep them traveling do it when everything is perfect right so the roads are clear they can get there and they can pay their taxes and so he says it couldn't be and then when he was now this is the key here and then he was was nature born like all other nature he come forth in the spring usually when the lambs are born in the spring and he was the lamb and notice this he says i believe he was born myself march april or somewhere along and there in the early spring recognizing he sees this march april i believe somewhere in there he's born in the early spring why because his birth follows nature and he comes as a lamb behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and so he's we see this in scripture and so even if we kind of backed off a little bit and we didn't want to say thus saith the lord or this is an absolute scriptural truth we see that him coming in the nature of a lamb that we would see this symmetry for god to allow him to be born in a time when lambs are born but that wouldn't stumble us we could see god allowing those things to line up and then also we find in the message god's gifts always find their places notice he says my march or april is kind of a time frame he uses he says he was a lamb and i believe that in the in that way being altogether nature and lambs are born in march april and somewhere along and there not later than may and you'll find that in the language he's using that when people are even somewhat of fixing a specific period of time it's march april may that a lot of the early church arrived at is when the possible time was they would be born so the earliest references are in april and may so he's saying march april but not later than may he says and i don't believe it was anything before march and anything after may some time along in there now brother branham is not affixing an exact date is he not saying oh thus saith the lord it's april 3rd he's looking at a time why is he looking at the season why is he looking at time because that's the season that lambs are born in the season that lambs are born maybe it's in this march april time maybe it's in this maybe maybe even with the years as they pass on even if you put a date on it 2 000 years pass and you'll find that the ebbs and flows of dates and the different calendars and the that if you're not going by a strict lunar cycle you'll be you know what it's maybe at a different point depending on the year right as far as a calendar is concerned then in the message unveiling of god he says see god follows nature exactly this is kind of the theme you find when he begins to identify god is in nature god set the clock right when he created nature he set these things in motion he actually put the stars out there to begin with and that was his first first bible and then nature is time to god's clock so he's representing certain things in nature and the seasons he says see god follows nature exactly see he was born a lamb that's the reason he was born out in a manger why was he born into stable why was he born among animals why was he born in a place perhaps they would have kept animals and why would he be there even those that kind of argue about the end they say well it was actually a house and in a house they were quite small so they had to be multi-use multi-purpose and you had a place where you worked and then at night that's where you kept the animals and you had a place where you slept and you ate and you had another place for storage and they got like these three-room houses and you worked in one during the day you brought the animals in at night and they're saying they may have not stayed in the main family room but they would have stayed in that work area there would have been a place for a cattle and for feeding it's like why is he why is christ living there well there may be a lot of explanations as to why he was in this room but there's truth to why it was and one of them is a lamb is this is where lambs are born he says they laid out in a manger he says lambs are not born in beds he said he was led to the calvary let me just pause there too even in the wrapping of swaddling claws uh there's those that point to the fact that newborns would have been wrapped in claws just like that lambs not newborn babies but lambs would have been wrapped in something like that and these things just kind of hold this symbolism i came across one place that said that lambs that were bred and cut kept for sacrifices were born in bethlehem the very ones used in the temple that's where they would have been shepherded that's where they would have been born and that's where they would have been raised is even in bethlehem so there's a lot of things that people use to kind of tie into these things he says see he was led to calvary lambs sheep are lead so this is all part of the symbolism of him being born in a manger so he says so he was led to the slaughter because he was a lamb everything identified him in nature that's the reason he was born in march or april not in december so those of us born in march or april were kind of like yes this is working out really good it's kind of all lining up here april march or april not in december so he's taking it out of the time of december is in a year that would unfold chronologically that's too late in the year even when those uh people have looked at the season and the time when they would have the lambs out in the field um feeding they say it would be as early as march but no later than september and so even then they they kind of affixed this time period they it more broad but we're able to by a prophet's insight and by him picking up on these keys in scripture he's saying he was born in march on april not december he says in the message who do you say this is he says he'd have to have been in march or april because he was the lamb and he was a male sheep and born in under the the ram ares now he starts bringing not just nature but now he's bringing in the stars and the first bible areas it had to be you see and sheep are not born in december anyway how sheep are born in the spring so he points out he's born under the sign ares which is the ram and aries is from march 21st to april 19th so now those of us born between the 21st and 19th we still feel like we're in the lottery right like our ticket's still good we could share a birthday with jesus and and so the male sheep are born under the ram now this time period the march 21st and uh april 19th corresponds to the month of nisan and the ancient calendar nissan for the jews and that would be what it would correspond to so we say march or april to us and brother-in-law says he's born in march or born in april to the jews it would actually only be one month that would be possible using that language march or april and so it means something even different if you look at it to on a jewish calendar so there's other places where brotherhood says he was born in april and there's other places where he's talking about in this season or during this time but just looking at these statements from these different messages and maybe this would satisfy some people just looking at it real quick it's in 63 and 64. all post seals right if that's where some people want to debate and so you're seeing he's identifying and affixing a particular time period of when christ was born i don't believe he's doing it for some reason that we would create some sort of superstition or some tradition around it but just to understand who christ is now paul picks this up this very idea of who christ is as peter has said he was the lamb without blemish and john says behold the lamb of god takes away the sin of the world and in the future the future view of christ he's viewed as a lamb paul in first corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 says purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump and ye are unleavened he's drawing from the passover when all the leaven would have to be purged uh this this in exodus chapter 12 and he says for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us when he says christ our passover this phrase passover is a very beautiful word that's used for us it says our passover and we might think it has a word for us we think maybe of a holiday we think of a feast we think of the time for israel the feast of passover but it's actually this passing over because that's what happened in exodus 13 and there when we read it he's passing over them and this is um at the time of the exodus there's not judgment in these homes that have applied the token who are doing exactly what they were told to do eating this lamb at this time but the word that's used is our passover is he is our paschal lamb is what it's representing i mean as in many translations actually stated as christ as christ being our passover lamb which is sacrificed for us you need me to if i can i can grab another mic you want to try that one all right we're going to switch real quick we'll see if this one all right how brother loyal use that one when you lead songs and i'll i'll switch to this one thank you for being patient i'm not embarrassed or nervous or anything there's a lot worse things that can happen when you're standing from a group of people so i trust that you're not uneasy and uncomfortable whenever the sound starts messing up it's one of the beautiful things when you have truth on your side you're not really you're not embarrassed about what you're saying so there's no sense of shame whenever things start going haywire so there's a from a point of confidence here i trust you feel comfortable i certainly do but when he says for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us he's saying christ is our paschal lamb this is what he is he is our paschal lamb he is our passover lamb so paul is specifically saying that the passover lamb the lamb that is instituted in exodus chapter 12 that lamb was foreshadowing jesus christ to the jews they know what a passover lamb is they know what it represented they this has this very rich symbolism and idea to them this is what the passover lamb is and now paul's saying but our paschal lamb the lamb of passover is christ that lamb that was instituted in exodus 12 is just speaking about christ who's to come so when paul is placing christ as the passover lamb maybe not just as a lamb but now he's a passover lamb that brings us to a very specific time period doesn't it so now let's look at exodus chapter 12 which is where we had taken our text i just think it's wonderful we're making very good time tonight in exodus chapter 12 verse 1. i may skip a little bit but i just have all six verses here to go through it says the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you so we we are approaching a new year the first month of the year is january now whatever calendar they kept whatever way they were keeping time if they were adhering to an egyptian calendar if they were adhering to maybe a chaldean calendar or whatever it is they might have been using god is actually saying forget whatever day keeper you've been using whatever calendar you've been using whatever plan or whatever timer you've been using whatever way you've been keeping the days start all over and and so if they had had january as their date he's actually saying no it's not january anymore and so this is why the first month of the year is different for the jews and for the hebrews than it is for us in a gregorian or even a julian calendar it's different because he's saying this month shall be unto you the beginning months it shall be the first month of the year to you and this month was nissan that's the month that became their first month of the year the beginning of their calendar the beginning of days this is a new beginning this is something starting on over very next chapter 13 verse 4 it says and they came out this day came you out in the month of aviv and so it's this is would be a word that would be used of eve would be another word used for nissan and the word actually it speaks of this spring a time when things are born a fertile season a time of coming forth and a spring and forth and the month of nissan falls in and we may have mentioned it already but nissan falls in march or april for us so aries is march in april brother bram says born march or april march or april these different places and then here we see that paul calls them the paschal lamb of the passover lamb and the time of this passover lamb when it's first instituted god says we're gonna start all over with the calendar we're gonna start all over and we're gonna start with a particular day 10 days later you're going to do this keep it for four days 15 days later there's going to be a sacrifice there's going to be the shedding of blood and it's going to be in the month of nisan which corresponds to our march and april but to them it would be one month be a particular season the beginning of something and and i and i'm holding back i realized maybe tonight i might have had the time to do it but i'm trying to learn i think i'm getting more wise as the years unfold to not try to shove so much in here on a wednesday night and i'm saving some things for sunday morning lord willing but this is so beautiful you begin to look at this and ponder this and let it really stand out to you what god is what's being emphasized in this when god says i'm starting over and i'm establishing a date a point where i'm bringing you out of egypt and all the things that represents to us and all that it stands for i'm going to bring you out and he says i want you to start counting differently so it's going to be in this time march and april for us on our counter but to them the month of habib or nissan so he says speaking unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house instituting what the feast of passover and everyone had to have a lamb in their house and instituting this feast of passover this is what is then observed as you as you can as you know this feast of passover then becomes very prominent in the ministry of jesus christ so it's instituted now in exodus 12 here the feast of passover and says in the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor take next unto his house take it according to the numbers of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb verse 5 your lamb shall be without blemish it says it shall be without blemish it's going to be just as peter says he was a as a lamb without blemish he said this lamb is to be sinless has to be spotless a male of the first year so what would have been very very convenient for them is to know that when lambs are born and a year later this is the male of the first year and these it would have been at this particular time and these and to the jews clean intervals really meant something and maybe we'll take a look at that uh on sunday says you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month there's symbolisms of christ crucifixion now coming to us and the whole assembly the congregation of heaven shall kill it in the evening and my so beautiful to see that when the passover is instituted this passover lamb is going to be killed at a particular time and then you come to the very time that christ is crucified and it says it's at the ninth hour he begins to cry out my god my god why stop forsaking me and it falls right into this time period in the evening time when the sacrifice is taking place and these steps would have been unfolding and it would have been killed and would have been offered that christ at the very same time the passover lamb is being crucified and sacrificed at the in the very image of when it was instituted in the talmud listen to this statement such a beautiful beautiful statement so i want to quote from the talmud and these things would be very precious to the jews and to the hebrews says it was a famous and old opinion among the ancient jews that the day of the new year which was the beginning of the israelites deliverance out of egypt should in the future time be the beginning of the redemption by the messiah this is how this is how the jews begin to view this time period nissan the first the first and the psalm the beginning of months that they believed that since this was the beginning of their deliverance out of egypt they held in their hearts the belief that in the future time when the messiah come it would happen at the same time to them nissan in our calendar march or april think about it redemption began in a cradle it was accomplished by his death and they're both lining up at the same time why because his birth connects to his death i held back to say it on sunday and i remember just kind of saying it a little bit differently but his birth connects to his death to the point where it's inseparable you can't we can't look at it without bringing him to view what he was born for and this is to me where i mentioned it i i i said that the focus of the mythology zeroes in so much on his birth that we create this separate identity of december 25th being the time when he was born and it's so far removed from the time of his crucifixion and resurrection it's almost become these polar opposites of worship and segments and these distinct poles within nominal christianity that uh become polarizing themselves but these altars as it were where people want to worship where when you begin to look at the truth of christmas it's so closely together connected with his death that one of the heirs of the myths is it separates out only one aspect it leaves the other one out of you i do not believe that we could accurately and appropriately worship jesus christ during this time and during the season if all we did was try to conjure up the nativity scene and worship him as a baby because that is that would only be focusing on on christ as a baby in the cradle and i i guess in my mind i would want maybe just to give more time to this because it has such a a beautiful thought it's not offensive if the entire world was forced to kneel at the foot of a crib or to a baby and worship an infant in a cradle it's easier for the world to worship a christ that can only babble it's easier to worship an innocent sinless harmless babe even in such a humble setting in a crib in a manger that there's no offense maybe to to say well this is the king let's worship him as a as a babe laying in a mainstream and i say that this is one that is very approachable you you wonder how approachable it is they even have a drummer boy there now as if playing his best the plane has been doing the best oceans drum solo you've ever heard for christ on the day of his cruise birth is somehow going to honor christ right we can have drummers there in the stall with jesus christ why because it's it's you can paint any picture you want as long as he stays in a manger christ is despite maybe the symbolism that's there it's it's easier it's a more inoffensive christ to worship should really ponder that point so in the message sirs we would see jesus brother branham says now jesus never said we read this sunday he's going to bring them to bethlehem jesus never said to the greeks because they can't say uh you know sirs we would see jesus and notice this imagery i just think it's so beautiful how brother brown's want us to kind of even how would our eyes move where would they be diverted like how would he where would he begin does he get out of his baby book does he produce his birth certificate he says that when they come up now just a moment if you want to see it i will take you i'll take you back to bethlehem where i was born and i'll tell you how it happened back there he says he never said that to him when they showed up he never said i'll just hold on a moment let me take you back to bethlehem where i was born i'll show you what happened there it wasn't that he pointed them to future plays if they wanted to know him if you want to know me in other words i won't take you back and tell you when i was born at bethlehem and all about it i'll point you to a place where i'm going to be crucified for you he had to be pointing to the purpose of his coming he had to be pointing to the purpose of why he was revealed himself why was the son of man being revealed in that moment in that time in that season he wasn't even going appointed to the events and circumstances presently he said i've got to point you to the place if you want to know me where i'm going to be a place where i'm going to be crucified for you i'll point you to a place where i'm going to be crucified he never pointed him back to bethlehem he says i he pointed them to a future place if they wanted to know him he pointed them to a future place i'm a little pitchy on this mic he pointed him to a future place if they wanted to know him then he says this this is just six pages later in the same message the greeks wanted to know jesus and he gave them the way to know him to know him not to know his creed not to know his word not to know his miracles when he says his word he's talking about just things that he said i believe but to know him and the only way and the only way you find that is at the cross not at the cradle think about the whole world taking everyone to a cradle right now christian the whole christian world the advent and everyone they're going to take you to christ in a cradle he says you can't find christ in the cradle no it's the cross you see so see he pointed them to a cross not to some creed not to some manger or a man of denominations but to the cross it's so beautiful now it's the same today a real disciple if you ever come to jesus he'll never say jesus told me to join so and so church he never did do that he wouldn't do it today no you'll just see him he'll point you to the cross go there and die now the cross has a different meaning go there you go there and die not just join a church not just get religious not just believe the message go there and die then you'll know him if you want to know him he says not one time did he point any person to any creed any denomination or to his birth or even to christmas not one time did he ever do it christ never pointed back to his birthday he never pointed back to his birth place he was never pointing back to those things if anything he fulfilled them and was carrying them forward and they're now embodied in the person that he is so he says if you want to know me you've got to find in the place where i'm going to be crucified for you this place where christ can be met he pointed them to a future place if they wanted to know him he says it's the same thing today he says a real disciple is not going to point you to some church joining he's not going to point you to a cradle even today even as message believers as we celebrate christmas we're not just pointing to a christ who's in a cradle and we're point but we're pointing to a cross which is made away and we're pointing to present-day prophecy not one time did he point any person to a creed denomination or even to his birth or even to christmas not one time did he ever do it that's not what he pointed to but notice he says not to a cradle but to a cross that's where you have to find them and part of this we want to get into it we invite the musicians to come we want to get into it lord willing on sunday as you see these things begin to line up he was born at a time when lambs were born and the time when the lamb was slain in exodus 12 corresponds to that same march april time period so his birth was connected to his death his birth is now the cradle is now connected to the cross and brother braham says in the message the deity of jesus christ he says as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man remember this this statement became just real stand out to me it's what we used at the beginning of this series a few times noah had some faithful ones in that day god's got some faithful ones today the hour is coming this great drama setting men and women if the holy ghost is dwelling in you the christ that was born 1900 years ago came to manhood he never stayed in the cradle christ never stayed in the cradle do you realize it's one of the that one of the things that's a little bit misleading about the cross is in a lot of the depictions of the crucifix christ is still on it when one of the most outstanding things about christianity is we're not pointing to a cross where our savior still hangs nor are we pointing to a tomb where our savior still lays but it's empty and brother brandon i'm saying the christ that was born 1900 years ago it's christmas day 1949 he said the christ that was born someday sometime maybe we believe in march or april during this time when lambs are born he says when christ was born he came to manhood he didn't stay in a cradle it's one of the things that the myth kind of cement in our minds even if it tries to bring christ back into view is he still in a cradle but he went from the cradle to the cross and then from a resurrection to accomplish redemption making redemption available for all of us when you begin to look at the life of christ brother branham identifies it here it's very striking he's saying our lives have to follow a parallel path in sirs we would see jesus he's saying and today a real servant of god is not going to point you to a cradle but he says he's going to point you to the cross he says where you go there and die so that you know him and he's saying that we who are christians who have the holy ghost dwelt inside of us he says you've got to grow to manhood that begins to see this parallel wherein christ came to his purpose and fulfilled what he was supposed to accomplish our lives have to follow a parallel path where we go from the cradle this natural cradle we go from a crib we go from a bassinet we go from crawling and walking but in our lives those of us who've been born of a woman have to ultimately go from a cradle to a cross that if the only way we're truly going to worship jesus christ today correctly during this season is it can't be tradition it can't be religion it can't be true through church membership or just accepting the message and listening to tapes on particular feast days but it has to be a birth where you've met him yourself through what he did on the cross we too ourselves have to go from our message cradles where we were born into message families or whatever we were born into but some point in our lives we have to find ourselves at the cross and really we shouldn't count our lives from the cradle but from the cross that's where it begins when we begin to point people in other words we wouldn't count our birthday on the day that we were born but we count our days from when we found him at the cross that place where we died and we were born again because jesus himself did not focus us on and orient us to on this day april 6 or on this day september 11th on this day may 19th on this day march 25th this is the day that you must worship me for the day in which i was born but he left it at the cross because that's where all of us can meet him and be born again we all share different birthdays in the natural we produced our passports we'd all maybe identify for many different countries and regions and places of birth we have different places of birth we have different places dates of our birthdays we all share in these differences but when we meet him in the cross we all are born in some way as a paradox the same day right because you weren't saved on any particular day here but that translates you into eternity how could you have a day in eternity what day is it what's today thousand years later what days it's today what was it yesterday today what is it tomorrow today that's why jesus christ is the same [Music] and that's where we find him that's what we find is such a beautiful narrative that begins to unfold as that we ourselves and this time i think it's so important when we're celebrating the birth of christ to find out and to ask ourselves has he been born in me let's stand tonight 136 different years that christ was born and different beliefs and slants on christianity different sex and religions that have affixed the birth of christ in every single month of the year maybe in some paradoxical way we have a body of christ that is made up of believers who have been born again at all different times different places different times of years but ultimately at one share in the same experience to be sealed with the holy ghost that's one thing i certainly would want to put before you tonight and in these things is to remind you that we believe in the baptism of the holy ghost we believe in the new birth not in tradition not in just the honoring of days and weeks and months but in truly meeting god face to face and being born again as you pondered over the next week or so week and a half as we lead up to christmas begin to ponder the symmetry of the birth of christ with his death you begin to see a beautiful mystery unfold let's bow our heads our gracious heavenly father as we stand in your presence this evening we are most thankful for this blood which was shed for us for the sacrifice of your son jesus upon the cross on mount calvary in golgotha blood was shed first expression upon earth was in the garden when a lamb was taken innocent slain bloodshed clothed stitched together and adam and the woman driven out of the garden with bleeding lamb skins draped upon them that's the image as they left the garden but lord the very first image the other side of the garden abel's offering another lamb it was pointing to lord this redemptive redemptive work of a sacrifice and lord i know there's very powerful songs at this time that we sang that your son was sent to give us the second birth and the joy and the peace and the redemption that was in his birth and even the tremendous even modern day christmas songs of a baby born to die lord it thrills us to ponder this but oh god beyond the poetry beyond the symbolism father may it be a reality to us that yes this is what is represented during this christmas time as you were sending a lamb to earth that we might be translated out of death into life that this lamb had come this aries ram would come and blood was shed that in believing and accepting this atonement we could be born again and that's the mystery of your first coming everything is shrouded and confused and so much lore and folklore and theology has covered it up but yet lord we begin to see such a beautiful truth preserved in your word and lord even then in the days of your first coming is we would not be pointing back to a cradle back to a cradle but jesus was pointing forward to a cross could we not then in this day with the benefit of that life blood which was shed for us now tabernacling in our flesh could we not point forward to the time when death itself will be placed under our feet could we not also be pointing to a place where you meet us today and that that would even be part of this christmas mystery is that wise men still seek you but they find you in your simplicity yet again the very things you hide yourself behind there is where you're going to reveal yourself and that we do not have a message that merely mimics what the rest of the world says whether it be well he's actually born in april or well we just know that he was born and he's born a lamb but today in this hour this present time that we're living and we see you unveiled once again and tabernacling behind skin may these be the things that we rehearse in our minds and our hearts and encourage one another with during this season and i pray lord that you bless us tonight we're so grateful to see many out here in the house of lord of different visitors that are with us may you bless them be their portion comfort the heist family the propolis family apostolic christian church lord during this time of loss may you just do some beautiful things for them over these next several days of mourning and the funeral that's soon coming may there just be such a supernatural move amongst the people oh we love you tonight we're so grateful to be together [Music] seal these things in our hearts and amplify them to us as only you can in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
