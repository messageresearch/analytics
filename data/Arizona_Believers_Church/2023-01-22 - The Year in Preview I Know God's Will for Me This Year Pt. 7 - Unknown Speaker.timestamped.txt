[0:00] We are continuing on the subject again
[0:02] on the year in preview is part seven
[0:05] we've taken it to say that we know the
[0:08] will of God for us this year because his
[0:10] word has
[0:12] planned the way there's a way that God
[0:15] wants us to go and he's telling us the
[0:17] way he's pointing us the right way and
[0:19] then his word his plan so many of the
[0:21] details for us there's a lot of details
[0:23] that he's already been able to cover and
[0:25] in this we've looked at on our Wednesday
[0:27] nights we've approached how God's will
[0:29] for me this year as it relates to my
[0:31] personal life is that I sanctify my home
[0:33] gather around the word and live for
[0:36] others and I encourage you if you're not
[0:37] here on Wednesday nights I do encourage
[0:39] us as a body and as a church to make
[0:41] some effort if you don't that's fine
[0:43] there's no way that we're taking a grade
[0:44] or auditing your YouTube activities to
[0:47] know whether or not you're doing this
[0:48] but I do encourage you to go back into
[0:50] the archives and watch the Wednesday
[0:52] night services because they're always
[0:54] kind of a companion to what we're
[0:56] ministering on Sundays and these have
[0:58] been what we've been covering on
[0:59] Wednesday nights and this last Wednesday
[1:00] night we've ministered on living for
[1:02] others and it's just such a beautiful
[1:04] subject matter that brother Brown
[1:05] approaches and it's such a great subject
[1:07] within the scripture and so the we're
[1:10] looking at in sanctifying the home
[1:11] you're creating creating a Haven away
[1:14] from the influences of the world and
[1:16] gathering on the word you're giving the
[1:17] Lord his due in our lives and giving him
[1:21] a place and this living for others we
[1:24] we've phrased it as the best form of
[1:27] family entertainment
[1:29] because living for others is eternal
[1:31] life and brother mam said the Holy
[1:33] Spirit entertains the church with
[1:35] eternal life and I believe it's a form
[1:36] of family entertainment and keeping the
[1:39] family busy and active and our serving
[1:42] Christ and what we identify as our
[1:44] serving Christ requires us to serve one
[1:47] another and to serve others we cannot be
[1:49] self-serving and be serving Christ that
[1:51] in your love and Devotion to Christ it
[1:53] causes service to other people and
[1:56] that's really how we tried to bring that
[1:57] out and look at it on Sundays we we've
[2:00] looked at how this is the will of God
[2:02] for us as a church or our participation
[2:04] in church is that we would assemble
[2:06] ourselves together we see that as the
[2:07] will of God today we're going to look at
[2:09] contributing tithes and offerings this
[2:11] is the will of God for us and I'm just
[2:13] not going to have the time to get into
[2:14] the missions aspect but I I really
[2:17] believe that's a strong part or that is
[2:20] a critical part of a strong church and
[2:22] even a critical part of your Spiritual
[2:24] Development is to have a mind for
[2:25] Missions and a heart for Missions and
[2:27] we've already identified how these are
[2:28] God's will for us
[2:30] actually brother John I'm going to let
[2:32] you take over this at this point and
[2:35] we'll just leave hold it there and then
[2:37] once we get to that scripture in second
[2:39] Corinthians I'll just I'll just let you
[2:40] run with it so I can uh be better be
[2:43] better up here instead of multitasking
[2:45] uh we touched on it how a symbol
[2:48] together is God's will that we do so as
[2:51] much as that we are as we are able
[2:53] and we were last Sunday we're
[2:56] identifying how this consistent
[2:57] voluntary behavior is a strength for you
[3:00] spiritually and also it should be our
[3:02] testimony because God has a purpose in
[3:04] it and we identified how it's more than
[3:06] just the the act of going to church but
[3:08] God has something behind it and it's
[3:10] important to recognize that it is
[3:12] voluntary
[3:14] um children don't answer this but how
[3:16] many of you were dragged to church today
[3:17] right the adults have done it of their
[3:20] own free will now you may have dragged
[3:22] yourself
[3:23] but you had the choice this isn't
[3:24] compelled by the government it's not
[3:26] compelled by the threat of ostracization
[3:27] or a you know a penalty of some sort
[3:30] this is something that you do of your
[3:33] own free will and that voluntary
[3:35] Behavior has a purpose and it speaks
[3:38] something to God and God has a benefit
[3:39] and a blessing when you do it it's part
[3:42] of God's plan to build up the believer
[3:44] and to edify the believer to promote our
[3:46] spiritual growth the Foster love these
[3:48] are the themes that we saw in the
[3:49] scripture and I really do believe and
[3:51] I'm kind of using this language art that
[3:53] regular Church attendance is important
[3:55] for our Spiritual Development as
[3:57] individuals but also the spiritual
[3:59] well-being of our families
[4:01] so your attendance to church isn't I
[4:03] that my concern as a pastor isn't that
[4:06] you attend church so that the church is
[4:07] healthy
[4:08] not at all because if you do attend
[4:11] church in one sense that makes a healthy
[4:13] church but if you're only attending
[4:16] church to attend church and we're not
[4:18] providing you resources that promote
[4:20] your Spiritual Development and protect
[4:22] and the spiritual well-being of your
[4:24] family then that is all you're doing and
[4:27] my desire is not that we would attend
[4:29] church regularly so that our church can
[4:30] be real robust and healthy because we
[4:32] are only as strong as your families we
[4:34] are only as healthy as you are
[4:36] spiritually healthy and so we don't eat
[4:39] until we don't live to eat we eat to
[4:42] live and we don't live to go to church
[4:44] we go to church to live and to be
[4:46] spiritual spiritually well so your
[4:48] attendance to church is not for the
[4:50] local church it's for you it's for the
[4:51] Believers that you edify in your
[4:53] attendance and it's for your Spiritual
[4:55] Development and well-being now
[4:57] now we're going really slow today is
[4:59] this progress
[5:01] if I'm going slow uh and you might be
[5:04] saying no you haven't even got you're
[5:05] not going to slow Yet brother Aaron
[5:06] you're just taking too long
[5:07] but on this subject of contributing
[5:09] tithes and offerings this is God's will
[5:11] for us and I would say that it's God's
[5:13] will that we we give consistently
[5:15] happily and generously because that
[5:18] consistent happy giving is God's will in
[5:21] the scripture and I will say this and I
[5:23] want you to know that in all of this I
[5:26] recognize that it's voluntary just like
[5:28] church attendance I mean just like even
[5:31] the things you do in your home we do not
[5:33] have regular home audits to make sure
[5:35] that your home is Sanctified we do not
[5:37] uh have a star board where we put stars
[5:40] next to your name if you're gathering
[5:42] around the word on a regular regular
[5:43] basis we have no other we don't have any
[5:45] means of keeping track of these things
[5:48] in a way that we could penalize you for
[5:50] not doing it so I recognize this is
[5:52] voluntary of your own heart as you see
[5:55] fit in the Lord that I believe it is
[5:58] God's will that we do these things now
[6:00] in second Corinthians chapter nine
[6:07] verses five and six it says therefore I
[6:09] thought it necessary to exhort the
[6:11] brethren
[6:12] that they would go before unto you and
[6:14] I'm going to go through this quickly go
[6:16] before unto you and make up beforehand
[6:17] your Bounty that's a word that's used of
[6:20] blessing it could have been said
[6:22] blessing but he's specifically referring
[6:23] to a collection of money and resources
[6:26] that are going to be distributed so he
[6:27] says make up your Bounty beforehand
[6:29] wherefore ye had noticed before that the
[6:32] same might be ready as a matter of
[6:34] bounty as a matter of blessing as a
[6:36] matter of giving and notice of
[6:38] covetousness so he's recognizing that
[6:41] the recipients aren't coveting it Paul's
[6:44] not covering it nowhere
[6:45] are you acting out of covetousness in
[6:48] withholding but you're willing to give I
[6:51] want to bring together this bounty and
[6:52] then this
[6:54] this next phrase Paul is saying this
[6:56] principle that is so important for us
[6:58] but this I say he which soweth sparingly
[7:00] shall reap also sparingly and he which
[7:03] soweth bountifully shall reap also
[7:05] bountifully Paul is clearly trying to
[7:08] encourage in them to not give a little
[7:11] and to not be Covetous to not be stingy
[7:13] but to give as you are able and to give
[7:16] as much as you're able recognizing that
[7:18] that's different for every person
[7:20] generosity is not a certain amount but
[7:22] generosity has a lot to do with a
[7:23] person's means and their ability uh just
[7:26] as Jesus taught us that the Widow that
[7:28] gave two mites was more generous than
[7:30] people that gave exponentially more than
[7:32] she did and so it's in that thought and
[7:35] in that image that he's trying just to
[7:37] encourage and we're going to end this
[7:38] service today this afternoon at this
[7:41] rate on a very clear thought in the
[7:43] scripture that to me just distills it up
[7:45] for me and inspires me to do to be my
[7:48] best at giving and not necessarily
[7:50] attach any particular Mountain to it but
[7:51] just to be a giver Paul is supporting
[7:54] that their Free Will offerings be
[7:57] generous
[7:58] and and that they'd be abundant like
[8:01] bring it together don't don't be
[8:02] sparingly don't be stingy don't uh don't
[8:05] withhold but give because he's saying if
[8:07] you do give and it's important to
[8:09] recognize this theme as we go forward if
[8:11] you do give whatever you give to
[8:13] whatever measure you give you get back
[8:14] that there's a there's a reciprocation
[8:16] that you can't out give God in other
[8:18] words if you give he's got a way of
[8:20] bringing it back your way and Paul's
[8:22] wanting him to think about that in terms
[8:24] of their giving and I'll say this
[8:27] that as well later we'll talk about
[8:29] Jesus when he addressed different
[8:30] elements in the law
[8:32] and how that um
[8:34] under the law he was speaking of the
[8:37] spirit of the law Paul is not eliciting
[8:39] any particular amount to them because it
[8:41] wouldn't have been better if in the
[8:43] second Corinthians chapter nine if he
[8:45] just said hey if everybody could give 50
[8:46] bucks the need would be met
[8:49] so then everybody could give 50 bucks
[8:51] and to some people who 50 bucks they
[8:53] spend that at Starbucks in one day like
[8:55] you know I can make my own coffee today
[8:58] and other people may have to really
[8:59] scrounge and collect and save just to be
[9:03] able to do that but something's lost as
[9:05] soon as you come up with a number then
[9:08] everybody feels that they've complied by
[9:10] just meeting that number and if I've
[9:12] shared this example with you before it's
[9:15] not doesn't require an amen because it's
[9:17] just a point in the law there's certain
[9:19] laws that I I deal with at a regular
[9:21] basis in my practice of law to where you
[9:24] have to make a determination whether or
[9:26] not
[9:27] um a company is called a shell company
[9:30] and the definition this is really good
[9:32] anybody wants to get into the practice
[9:33] of law Securities that the deafnesses of
[9:36] cell company is no or nominal assets or
[9:38] operations no no or nominal assets or
[9:42] operations well just tell me
[9:45] what's nominal and the SEC refuses to do
[9:48] it because they recognize that as soon
[9:49] as you place a dollar value that becomes
[9:51] the threshold that every company that
[9:53] wants to be a shell but technically not
[9:55] be a shell they just have to have to put
[9:58] this much money in the bank and if it
[9:59] was five million dollars in there trust
[10:02] me there's people that would just put
[10:03] five million dollars nominally into a
[10:07] bank account just so that they comply
[10:09] with the rule and the SEC recognizes in
[10:12] doing so they would be in violation of
[10:14] the spirit of the law therefore they
[10:16] make it a determination of whether or
[10:18] not it's only their nominally regardless
[10:20] of the amount so I've had clients that
[10:22] I've successfully argued they weren't
[10:23] shells who had nominal assets because
[10:27] they were just a software company and
[10:29] they didn't have a lot of assets they
[10:31] just had a bunch of coders you know and
[10:33] that's all they had and they had two
[10:35] MacBooks and some guys banging on
[10:37] keyboards a room full of monkeys on
[10:39] keyboards or turning out apps it's like
[10:41] you can't judge this the same way you
[10:43] would a mental a middle uh oil company
[10:46] or something like that and so you're
[10:48] like brother Aaron this is a Sunday not
[10:49] a Monday to wake up sorry I got carried
[10:53] away on my CLE requirements no I say it
[10:56] to say that Paul is not telling us an
[10:58] amount and the New Testament is silent
[11:00] on any specific threshold of 500 or
[11:03] certain percentages it's because we
[11:06] don't ever want to be guilty of just
[11:07] doing just enough just enough to get by
[11:11] oh that's the minimum you mean I only
[11:13] have to do a three-minute speech I I can
[11:16] I'd only have to write a 800 word essay
[11:18] right and so you go through and
[11:19] everything is
[11:21] and you add in a bunch of adverbs and
[11:24] things just to get to the amount that's
[11:25] not what God wants he doesn't want
[11:28] technical compliance he wants obedient
[11:30] hearts
[11:31] who are giving and therefore when you
[11:33] give if you don't meet what other people
[11:35] can give and there's no specific
[11:37] threshold you're still in God's eyes
[11:39] just like that widow woman who's given
[11:41] her all
[11:43] and so in verse 7 as we continue
[11:46] he is expressing this in such a
[11:49] beautiful way every man so if you sow
[11:51] he's saying so bountifully
[11:54] he says so every man according as he
[11:56] purposeeth in his heart so this is your
[11:58] own free will as you judge and discern
[12:01] in your heart so let him give
[12:04] and the only requirements and
[12:05] qualifications he puts on this besides
[12:07] being generous or Bountiful
[12:10] and of your own free will is to not do
[12:13] it grudgingly or of necessity feeling
[12:15] compelled that you have to don't give
[12:17] against your conscience
[12:19] like if you don't want to give don't
[12:21] give
[12:22] right don't do it don't do it against
[12:23] your conscience and it's it's what
[12:25] happens in a lot of different
[12:26] relationships when someone feels
[12:28] compelled to do something they feel like
[12:30] they have to do it and when I I have
[12:32] this saying a lot of times and people
[12:34] say oh brother Aaron you didn't have to
[12:35] do that that was so nice I always say
[12:37] well I felt like I had to
[12:38] hey and uh and I'm just joking but they
[12:42] might have thought I was serious like
[12:43] that was really weird
[12:45] but it's something that if you knew that
[12:47] someone did it because they felt like
[12:48] they had to immediately it's kind of
[12:49] like
[12:50] well it kind of cheapens it right you
[12:53] know with all these birthdays going on I
[12:54] mean if somebody got a gift and like
[12:55] well they just felt like they had to
[12:57] because you go to church together they
[12:58] felt like they had to because they got
[13:00] something for you it changes the whole
[13:02] tenor of all of it the whole feeling and
[13:03] meaning behind it so Paul is saying
[13:05] don't give against your conscience
[13:06] giving shouldn't be painful you
[13:09] shouldn't be uneasy in doing it and so I
[13:11] think it's good even though I guess in
[13:13] some ways you'd think that if you are
[13:15] relying upon giving in order to maintain
[13:17] a church and pay the bills and make a
[13:19] living that by any means necessary just
[13:21] twist their arms even if it hurts give
[13:23] but I don't think in the long run that's
[13:25] healthy
[13:26] I don't think that's healthy for any of
[13:28] us uh to be giving against our
[13:30] conscience so I commend you if you're
[13:32] only giving as you feel led and it's up
[13:35] to you to determine whether or not that
[13:36] also pleases God but he's saying don't
[13:39] do it grudgingly or of necessity for God
[13:41] loveth a cheerful Giver
[13:45] so he's saying you ought to be generous
[13:47] you ought to be willing you ought to be
[13:49] cheerful and happy and giving and God
[13:51] loves someone who willingly gives and
[13:54] takes pleasure and giving
[13:56] you'll find this theme as we'll touch on
[13:57] it through the scripture that this that
[14:00] kind of giving heart that willingness to
[14:02] assist and to Aid is something that
[14:04] pleases God
[14:05] it's part of the character of God in his
[14:07] nature
[14:08] and now I believe and I want to start
[14:11] with looking at the New Testament
[14:13] I believe the teaching is clear on this
[14:14] point that Christians should be givers
[14:17] and in particular they should be givers
[14:19] of their increase to support the work of
[14:21] the Lord and I bet I believe just even
[14:24] in all areas of Our Lives Christians
[14:25] should be unselfish they should be
[14:27] givers and that how they ought to be
[14:29] characterized we ministered on this last
[14:32] April April 25th 2022 sermon number 158
[14:37] if you're counting on worship it's
[14:39] called total worship teaching on
[14:41] Christian giving so I would actually
[14:43] encourage our home folks here to go back
[14:45] and to access the archives on that and
[14:48] I'll be able to tell whether or not the
[14:50] views budge at all
[14:51] um so any of you are doing it unless
[14:53] there's some bootlegs out there of my
[14:55] sermons and you guys are hey we need
[14:57] 158.
[14:58] anybody got 158 on vinyl
[15:01] and so the the total worship teaching on
[15:04] Christian giving and the principle
[15:06] behind that is that your pain of your
[15:09] tithes and offerings was an act of
[15:11] worship and it was an act of praise to
[15:14] God it's part of our religious service
[15:15] it's part of our worship and the Very
[15:17] theme behind giving of your increase the
[15:21] act of giving of your increase is an act
[15:22] of worship to God in praise to God and
[15:25] we should never disassociate that that
[15:28] and I would believe that it would even
[15:29] be fair that as you do unto others and
[15:31] as you give unto others and as you do
[15:33] good unto all men especially those of
[15:35] the household of faith you do it as unto
[15:37] the Lord from whom you know your reward
[15:38] comes from
[15:39] and so that in your service to others
[15:42] it's an act of worship to God not a
[15:44] beautiful way to look at how you could
[15:46] even humble yourself to those who are
[15:47] mean to you do things for people that
[15:49] that don't can't really accept it
[15:51] because you're like at the end of the
[15:52] day Lord I'm doing this unto you as I
[15:55] wash their feet I see myself as washing
[15:57] your feet as I bear their burden I see
[16:00] myself as bearing your burden so I'm not
[16:02] just doing this uh for
[16:04] self-glorification and so that I could
[16:06] let people know that I you know I got my
[16:08] personal best this year in giving but I
[16:10] do it as an act of worship and praise to
[16:13] God in Proverbs chapter 3 verses 9 and
[16:15] 10 it says honor the Lord with thy
[16:17] substance glorify God out of your
[16:19] increase because it says and with the
[16:21] first fruits of thine increase so shall
[16:23] thy barns be filled with plenty and thy
[16:25] presses shall burst out with new wine
[16:29] this is and if you if this is connected
[16:31] with the general theme of giving unto
[16:33] the Lord and praising the Lord this
[16:35] isn't this isn't necessarily a call to
[16:37] obedience to the law but a call to
[16:40] something that's in God's heart and the
[16:41] Heart of the believer to honor the Lord
[16:42] with your substance
[16:44] and with your increase glorify God
[16:46] worship God honor God and this is an
[16:48] endless a gratitude offering to God
[16:51] where you have substance and increase an
[16:55] endless offering of gratitude to God by
[16:57] honoring him with these things and it
[16:59] says as of promise
[17:01] that it will lead to increase
[17:05] and it'll lead to blessing and plenty so
[17:08] this is one of the scriptures I believe
[17:09] we used last time to emphasize it's a
[17:11] form of worship that comes with a
[17:13] blessing and God promises to bless us
[17:15] and in this if you honor the Lord with
[17:18] your substance and with the first fruits
[17:20] I increase we recognize that whatever
[17:22] God provides through substance or
[17:24] increase or income
[17:26] that it is always there's always a part
[17:29] reserved for God
[17:30] it has been provided by God therefore
[17:32] I'm singling out something that I give
[17:35] back to God and I love uh how brother
[17:37] Garcia preached it and this is what I
[17:39] was told how brother Garcia appreciate
[17:40] he said that we say 10 is God's but no
[17:43] all
[17:44] or he said 10 is just the part that God
[17:47] asked for back and so this is how he
[17:48] taught it that you haven't even given
[17:50] yet
[17:51] unless you give more than 10 because
[17:53] that's just the 10 that he requires back
[17:55] and then you the rest is anything you
[17:57] give additionally is really giving and
[18:00] but another way of also looking at is
[18:01] that he's all it's all gods he's only
[18:03] asking for 10 back so he recognize this
[18:06] is all from God and so part's going to
[18:08] be reserved alone for God
[18:11] and it Bears to say that based upon this
[18:14] scripture that when we give that part
[18:16] the remainder of what we have given
[18:19] whether assets or income or increase or
[18:22] substance is blessed
[18:23] that when we give
[18:25] that part the remainder that we are
[18:27] still stewards over God says here in
[18:30] this scripture that I will bless that
[18:32] part your barns will be full and your
[18:33] presses will burst with new wine
[18:36] it says in second Corinthians chapter 9
[18:38] verses 8 9 10 and God is able to make
[18:41] all grace abound towards you that ye
[18:44] always have in all sufficiency in all
[18:46] things may abound to every good work
[18:49] what is Paul saying just he said God
[18:51] loveth the cheerful Giver one that gives
[18:52] bountifully when it gets cheerfully
[18:54] willingly and bountifully that
[18:56] consistent happy generous Giver he's
[18:58] saying that God as he's already said if
[19:01] you so bountifully you rebountifully
[19:03] it's exactly what Proverbs is saying he
[19:05] said God is able to make all grace
[19:07] abound towards you so in in the image of
[19:10] giving he's saying that don't ever think
[19:12] that whatever you've given out you're
[19:15] always going to be in deficit to that
[19:17] amount or less that amount
[19:19] because God is able to make grace abound
[19:22] to you so you'll always have sufficiency
[19:25] in all things
[19:26] I mean that's the promise that I would
[19:28] highlight so much that it bleeds through
[19:29] to the next page that he is saying that
[19:31] if I give us unto the Lord he's going to
[19:34] make sure that he provides my needs that
[19:36] I'll have all sufficiency in all things
[19:38] and so then he quotes the scripture as
[19:40] it is written he have dispersed abroad
[19:42] he had given to the poor his
[19:43] righteousness remaining forever now he
[19:46] that ministereth seed to the sower both
[19:48] Minister bread for your food and
[19:50] multiply your seed sown and increase the
[19:53] fruits of your righteousness
[19:54] God promises to bless those who
[19:57] willingly and happily and generously
[19:59] give it's been written in the Old
[20:01] Testament Paul affirming it in the New
[20:03] Testament that those who give us unto
[20:05] the Lord and give in a Godly way God
[20:07] promises that they will have sufficiency
[20:09] in all things he'll bless those who give
[20:12] according to his word
[20:14] and so it could be said that if we
[20:15] withhold God's part whereas there's a
[20:17] part reserved for God and we do not give
[20:19] and we do not obey then there's a limit
[20:21] on our entire increase
[20:24] I think some would put it in these terms
[20:27] and you're tempted to put in these terms
[20:29] and I'll clarify later why I reserve
[20:31] this but some would say that if you
[20:33] don't give there's a curse on the rest
[20:35] of your assets and income and and I
[20:38] would say that if there is any curse
[20:40] it's probably related to something else
[20:41] involved in not just your lack of giving
[20:44] there's maybe something else at work but
[20:46] I would say that your failure to give
[20:48] limits your bountifulness it limits your
[20:52] increase it limits uh there's a there's
[20:54] a cap on your sufficiency there's maybe
[20:56] a shortcoming in your wealth and your
[20:59] possessions
[21:00] and so I believe that we're instructed
[21:02] according to the word of God that we
[21:03] ought to manage our possessions manage
[21:05] our increase in a way not to please
[21:08] ourselves but to glorify God
[21:10] that I'm not merely managing my asset so
[21:13] that I'm in a better position to borrow
[21:14] money I'm not merely trying to do this
[21:16] so that I can recognize when I've made a
[21:18] million dollars or there's certain
[21:20] benchmarks when I can become an
[21:21] accredited investor when I'm no longer a
[21:23] shell person because I'm more than
[21:25] nominal assets and operations it's not
[21:28] that kind of value system we manage our
[21:31] wealth we manage our assets we manage
[21:33] our time we manage our our bodies we
[21:35] manage everything not to serve ourselves
[21:37] to be self-serving or to please
[21:39] ourselves but to glorify God is that not
[21:42] true
[21:42] that everything we do we want to do it
[21:44] to glorify God and not just to be
[21:46] self-serving so Paul continues in verse
[21:48] 11 being enriched in everything to all
[21:50] bountifulness which causeth through US
[21:53] Thanksgiving to god notice how that your
[21:55] giving glorifies God and causes others
[21:59] to glorify God for the administration of
[22:01] this service not only supplyeth the want
[22:03] of the Saints but is abundant also by
[22:06] many thanksgivings unto God whilst by
[22:09] the experiment of this menstruation they
[22:10] glorify God for your professed
[22:12] subjection unto the gospel of Christ and
[22:15] for your liberal distribution unto them
[22:17] and unto all men
[22:19] I know maybe it's written in a little
[22:21] bit of an Old English language and maybe
[22:23] using some heavy heavy phrasing and you
[22:27] could go back and read this in the
[22:28] Amplified Bible or the living Bible
[22:30] and and actually I have a Bible called
[22:32] The Message Bible
[22:34] not the message you're thinking about
[22:35] it's a little bit different but there's
[22:37] ways it's written in more plain English
[22:39] so you could kind of grab a hold of it
[22:40] and recognize what's being said but he's
[22:42] saying that you're giving your liberal
[22:44] distribution your willingness to give to
[22:46] Aid the Believers to support certain
[22:48] causes and to help people in need and I
[22:50] would say this about the church here in
[22:52] all you're given and your Aid to support
[22:54] Believers and their distresses when we
[22:56] take up special offerings and things it
[22:58] causes them to glorify God because they
[23:01] recognize that the Lord has provided for
[23:04] you
[23:05] and so not only is your giving an act of
[23:08] worship and praise to God but it causes
[23:09] others to give Thanksgiving to God and
[23:12] Paul is recognizing that Christians
[23:14] ought to be givers and that in giving
[23:15] you worship God and you glorify God and
[23:18] your generosity and your consistent and
[23:19] given and your happiness and giving and
[23:21] this attitude of a giving believer it
[23:23] just has this resounding praise that's
[23:26] offered unto God and then anybody
[23:28] impacted by that praise and worship then
[23:31] also Echoes out their own Praise And so
[23:33] there's just this thundering chorus of
[23:36] gratitude and Thanksgiving and worship
[23:37] that is offered to God through your
[23:39] giving
[23:42] some of you may not like to sing loud
[23:44] and worship and raise your hands in
[23:45] certain ways and you like to sing movie
[23:47] more quietly and soberly and that's an
[23:49] act of worship and praise and maybe you
[23:52] wish that you could do more to praise
[23:53] God well given is the way of resounding
[23:55] praise and causing others to praise and
[23:57] it's a praise that's unending
[23:59] Jesus touches on it this way in Luke
[24:01] chapter 6 verse 38 give and it shall be
[24:04] given unto you
[24:05] I want you to recognize how that God
[24:07] invites us to give with the promise of a
[24:09] reward
[24:10] if we give for his sake like this is
[24:12] Jesus teaching to be given to be givers
[24:14] give and it shall be given unto you good
[24:17] measure pressed down and shaken together
[24:19] and running over shall men give into
[24:22] your bosom the the the image there is as
[24:25] one would have a cloak and it would have
[24:27] and this cloak could be used to carry
[24:30] something that the whole idea of this
[24:32] grain or these Dry Goods it's
[24:34] referencing the measure of dried Goods
[24:36] being poured into your bosom just how
[24:37] much you'd be able to carry and in this
[24:41] giving give and it shall be given unto
[24:43] you what's going to be given to you so
[24:44] think of it this way
[24:46] whatever you give
[24:48] God you something's going to be given to
[24:51] you
[24:51] and Jesus is saying that this reward for
[24:53] giving is pressed down
[24:56] shaken together
[24:57] and running over
[24:59] it's it's it's if any of you have ever
[25:02] gone somewhere and maybe I don't know if
[25:03] it's Chipotle that you can draw this
[25:05] analogy from but you go and you ask for
[25:06] something you're like
[25:08] boy you really went easy on the meat
[25:10] there pal right
[25:12] like what are we measuring this thing in
[25:13] anymore like just one little fajita
[25:16] thing on the you're like what
[25:18] that ain't three ounces all right we
[25:21] want all our ounces
[25:23] and and you go some places and and you
[25:25] get a you you order a a cup of a green
[25:28] tea and you get it and you look at you
[25:30] like they didn't even fill the cup
[25:31] halfway
[25:33] and and Ryan you've all I got to find
[25:35] some ways for you guys to relate to what
[25:36] I'm saying maybe I should have said
[25:38] coffee
[25:39] and you get your coffee and it's not
[25:41] it's you know half of its foam and once
[25:43] you get all that out it's like hey they
[25:44] shorted me it's exactly what Jesus is
[25:45] referring to he's referring to if you're
[25:47] going to be receiving something you're
[25:49] not going to get cheated or shorted
[25:51] and it's not just going to be in there
[25:52] real fluffy and lightly packed so that
[25:55] it says oh it looked like it was a lot
[25:56] but that once you really started once
[25:58] you got all the ice out of it you had
[26:00] this much iced coffee no he's saying
[26:02] it's going to be pressed down shaken so
[26:04] that everything settles and then running
[26:06] over
[26:07] all right so if you ever packed
[26:09] something with dry goods there's a way
[26:11] you just kind of put it in there be
[26:12] something shaking it settling it get it
[26:14] pressed down make it as much room as you
[26:16] can and then get it to a point where it
[26:17] flows over so that there's no question
[26:19] that whatever measure you wanted you get
[26:22] it and exceed it
[26:25] it's a reference to being given Dry
[26:27] Goods and so it says for with the same
[26:30] measure that you meet out with all shall
[26:33] be measured to you again and I love just
[26:35] how beautifully Jesus instead of
[26:37] encouraging people to give press down
[26:40] shaken together and running over he says
[26:42] just give
[26:44] and it shall be given to you in good
[26:45] measure pressed down and shaken together
[26:47] and running over and so then he says so
[26:49] whatever measure you give at is the
[26:51] measure you'll receive
[26:53] so when we give we want it pressed down
[26:54] shaken together overflowing we want to
[26:57] be generous God is saying uh give and I
[26:59] would even say this
[27:00] give to whatever measure you want to
[27:03] receive from God
[27:04] that's exactly the image that's being
[27:06] expressed in the scripture is what do
[27:08] you expect to receive from God
[27:10] how many of you want 20 from God 30 can
[27:13] I have a 40 50. you want a hundred right
[27:17] we want that's what we want we want a
[27:20] hundred or is it handy is that what we
[27:22] say
[27:23] we want 100.
[27:25] and if that's what you want then you got
[27:27] to give a hundy
[27:28] right you can't just be given 50 and
[27:30] expecting 100. you've got to give it all
[27:32] you got to get a hundred percent and so
[27:34] this is what if whatever measure you
[27:36] want to get back from God and receive
[27:38] from God give to God
[27:40] because it's giving and I just I I think
[27:43] in the scriptures and how they're
[27:44] aligning themselves and and the thought
[27:47] of How It's a praise and an act of
[27:49] Thanksgiving I just want to make
[27:50] reference to this even though I was
[27:51] studying it more on this to bring it out
[27:53] that your act of giving it's an
[27:55] expression of gratitude to God
[27:58] that when you give back to God it's a
[28:00] way of saying hey you know what thank
[28:01] you that's right right and I think
[28:03] there's times when people may give us a
[28:05] gift they give us something and because
[28:06] they gave it to us they're the first
[28:08] person that maybe we allowed to partake
[28:10] in it uh and if someone maybe gives you
[28:13] a gift of food sometimes say Hey you
[28:16] have the first piece or you get the
[28:17] taste it because of the way of showing
[28:19] Thanksgiving
[28:20] and it's an expression of gratitude to
[28:22] God and if I could say this and I hope
[28:24] this really has an impact gratitude the
[28:27] expressing gratitude gratitude is an
[28:30] antidote to insecurity
[28:33] that an expression thing expressing
[28:35] Thanksgiving there's a little bit of
[28:37] vulnerability in that right
[28:39] when you say thank you to somebody else
[28:40] you say thank you you're acknowledging
[28:42] they've done something for you that
[28:43] maybe you that you needed and that was a
[28:45] benefit and so saying thank you is an
[28:47] antidote to insecurity and it's an
[28:49] antidote to this self-serving protection
[28:53] and so if we give if we give and this
[28:55] expression to God and we give unto the
[28:57] Lord it's an act of gratitude and this
[28:59] is an antidote
[29:01] uh to some personal insecurities and
[29:03] things
[29:04] it says in Acts chapter 20 verse 35 I've
[29:06] showed you all things how that so
[29:07] laboring you ought to support the weak
[29:10] and remember the words of the Lord Jesus
[29:12] how he said it is more blessed to give
[29:14] than to receive
[29:16] this is the only place we read this as
[29:18] being attributed to the Lord
[29:23] but somehow Paul knew that Jesus said
[29:26] it's more blessed to give than to
[29:28] receive
[29:29] I believe that he could have gathered
[29:30] that from Luke chapter 6.
[29:32] but it's done as a statement it is more
[29:34] blessed to give than to receive giving
[29:36] is a cure for selfishness
[29:38] it's anecdote to insecurities it's a
[29:41] cure for selfishness it's a guard
[29:42] against greediness
[29:44] that there's a way of hoarding and
[29:46] Gathering and and you're keeping things
[29:48] and you want to keep things and and you
[29:50] want to have it makes it a lot harder to
[29:52] get well I'm trying to reach a certain
[29:53] level and I want to have a certain thing
[29:54] and it's real easy to get stingy
[29:57] and so this act of giving I'm sorry that
[29:59] you guys are getting exhausted with this
[30:01] but this act of giving is a way of of
[30:04] cure making sure that I I'm not always
[30:08] hoarding and I'm not always just
[30:09] self-serving that I do trust the Lord
[30:12] because I'm willing to give because I
[30:14] have this understanding if I give if I
[30:16] give a certain amount he's promised that
[30:17] he's going to make that up press down
[30:19] Shake him together and running over so I
[30:21] shouldn't be fearful to guard against
[30:23] greediness
[30:24] and there's a lot of ways that we can be
[30:26] raised and a lot of things we can
[30:27] experience and have a lot of complexes
[30:29] where we don't ever want to give
[30:30] it could be that way with your emotions
[30:32] and your affections and your and your
[30:34] heart and your time and you don't want
[30:35] to be vulnerable because you've been
[30:36] hurt before and you've been taken
[30:38] advantage of and that can carry over
[30:39] into a lot of areas of our lives so I'm
[30:41] so glad that God provides us a safe way
[30:44] to give
[30:45] and it gives us this opportunity where
[30:47] we can love him without fear of reprisal
[30:49] we can love him without a fear of being
[30:51] unrequited we can serve him without the
[30:53] fear of being abandoned and he gives us
[30:55] this Outlet in this channel where we can
[30:56] be unreserved and unguarded because
[30:58] we're doing it under the Lord
[31:00] and it's such a healing power
[31:03] and a protection
[31:05] even being in the habit of giving
[31:07] increases
[31:08] increases the moderation of your heart's
[31:10] desire right
[31:12] like it's a it's a guard against uh just
[31:15] giving over to certain emotions and
[31:17] being plagued by certain habits
[31:20] in the sermon actually in the question
[31:22] and answers part four this is the
[31:24] question brother Branham has asked when
[31:25] a person realizes he has an inferior
[31:27] complex of some sort of complex how may
[31:30] he overcome this oh this is getting deep
[31:34] or some sort of complex how may he
[31:36] overcome this should it should it be if
[31:38] he was the only child caused this in his
[31:41] early youth I mean there's a lot here
[31:43] right I mean it kind of may be one of
[31:45] those things that when the person put in
[31:47] this question it was read they were
[31:48] going
[31:49] I wonder if he knows if this is about
[31:51] him right because they have somebody in
[31:53] mind somebody in particular I think it
[31:56] might because they're an only child and
[31:58] the only child the people who are in a
[31:59] family and they were the only child
[32:00] maybe there's certain things here you
[32:02] can relate to but it's like if someone
[32:03] has an inferiority complex uh if they're
[32:06] only if they have some sort of habits
[32:08] that have been cultivated since they
[32:09] were a child and an only child how can
[32:12] we handle it brother says take exactly
[32:13] the opposite
[32:15] now and I'm using this in the idea that
[32:18] giving is an expression of your attitude
[32:20] giving moderates hearts desires so if
[32:22] there's a selfishness there if there's a
[32:24] stinginess there if there's a luxury in
[32:26] certain things and we need more
[32:27] moderation that are giving to the Lord
[32:29] and giving to others as a way of
[32:30] moderating that and so brother bam says
[32:33] take exactly the opposite now notice the
[32:35] example he says if you're always wanting
[32:36] your way and that one little brat that
[32:39] wants to always have everything your way
[32:43] well don't sugarcoat it brother bran I'm
[32:45] just I mean
[32:47] what
[32:48] not clear how you feel about this
[32:50] turn right back around and give
[32:52] everything you got the other way
[32:54] all right so if you if you just want
[32:56] everything your way he's saying just
[32:57] turn it right back around the other way
[32:59] if you're selfish and you want to hold
[33:01] everything then start giving away what
[33:03] you got just go vice versa that's the
[33:07] way to overcome anything is an antidote
[33:09] what's an antidote it's a remedy against
[33:11] poison
[33:12] to counteract something and nullifies it
[33:14] and voids its Effectiveness so he's
[33:17] saying that if there's something in us
[33:18] that tends to the greed tends to
[33:21] selfishness tends the wrong way doing
[33:24] the opposite or what would be
[33:25] counter-intuitive to that is the balance
[33:27] or the cure to that
[33:29] and so if there's if there's bad I'll
[33:32] say this and I guess maybe I haven't
[33:33] thought through this uh and so this
[33:35] isn't necessarily stream of
[33:36] Consciousness but if you have bad
[33:39] financial habits began being disciplined
[33:42] in your giving unto the Lord is a start
[33:44] to reigning in bad financial habits
[33:48] and even if it's just because you don't
[33:50] have as much as you used to have to
[33:51] gamble right because now that I'm giving
[33:54] to the Lord I have much less to gamble
[33:56] with and at least you know that's secure
[33:57] and can never be lost
[33:59] right so just even in that effort to say
[34:02] hey I am going to go and I'm going to I
[34:04] want I'm very bad at this and I'm very
[34:06] unrestrained in this or I I make bad
[34:08] decisions financially make the ones that
[34:11] you know are good right and then I can
[34:14] begin to guard against the heuristics in
[34:16] our lives or the biases in our lives
[34:17] that cause us to make bad financial
[34:19] decisions
[34:20] so this is uh this is all related to
[34:23] giving in Matthew chapter 6 verses 19 to
[34:25] 21
[34:27] lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon
[34:29] Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt
[34:31] and where thieves break through and
[34:33] steal
[34:34] but lay up for yourselves Treasures in
[34:36] Heaven
[34:38] where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt
[34:40] and where thieves do not break through
[34:41] nor steal
[34:42] for where your treasure is there will
[34:45] your heart be also
[34:48] there's for where your treasure is there
[34:51] will your heart be also something
[34:53] because your treasure something becomes
[34:55] your treasure
[34:57] Whenever you set your heart on it
[35:00] it's something that you you set your
[35:02] affections on and you say you value
[35:04] something and that's how that's why some
[35:06] things one man's junk is another man's
[35:08] treasure it's not necessarily because of
[35:10] the inherent value
[35:12] right it's because the affections that
[35:14] are set on it
[35:16] for where your treasure is there will
[35:17] your heart be also it has this uh kind
[35:20] of inversion to it as well
[35:22] and by giving
[35:24] and this is when Jesus is saying lay it
[35:26] not up your Treasures in Heaven by
[35:27] giving whether it be of your money or
[35:28] service or your time giving as God asks
[35:31] we learn to treasure the things of God
[35:33] more
[35:34] because as we give something that is of
[35:36] a value to us to the things of God
[35:38] there's a transfer of affection there's
[35:39] a transfer of attention there's a
[35:41] transfer of value and ownership and when
[35:43] you give is unto the Lord I'd like to
[35:45] say this when you give is unto the Lord
[35:47] that gift is registered in heaven and
[35:49] secure and nothing can devalue that or
[35:52] diminish it
[35:53] as it relates to your giving as unto the
[35:55] Lord through tithes and offerings and
[35:57] support of missions I believe that if
[35:59] you were to give um a thousand dollars
[36:01] to a missionary to support the work of
[36:03] the Lord to buy a motorcycle to
[36:05] evangelize and to build a church and you
[36:07] find out later that they they used it
[36:09] all on something else your gift has not
[36:11] been devalued in the eyes of God your
[36:13] blessing is secure when you give us unto
[36:16] the Lord and you pay your tithes and you
[36:17] pay your offerings there is no detriment
[36:19] to you in your giving if the person who
[36:22] receives it is Unfaithful in their
[36:24] stewardship
[36:25] and that's the security you can have
[36:27] because sometimes we take ownership of
[36:29] it even after we've given it it's like
[36:30] here this is a gift but I want you to
[36:33] use it this way right and these are the
[36:35] qualifications on it and this is how you
[36:36] can use it this way and you can use it
[36:38] that way and then it's kind of like you
[36:39] know what why don't you just keep it
[36:41] because it sounds like you've got all
[36:43] the ideas of how you want to use it
[36:44] right and retaining ownership over it or
[36:48] being able to call it back you haven't
[36:49] really given it right but when you give
[36:52] us unto the Lord Jesus is saying that
[36:53] you're laying up Treasures in Heaven and
[36:56] the stewards of your gift will answer to
[36:58] God for how they use it and it will be
[37:00] upon them their loss and to their
[37:03] detriment how they've handled your
[37:05] voluntary gift
[37:07] so I want you to know that your gift
[37:08] remains pristine and unsullied and
[37:12] perfect in the eyes of God to whatever
[37:13] measure you gave it it remains as
[37:16] treasure stored in heaven
[37:17] to think that even at the Judgment when
[37:20] those who are not even elected to
[37:21] eternal life gave
[37:24] right some Act of service
[37:28] The Eyes Of God nothing nothing after
[37:30] that act of their own accord that they
[37:32] did diminish the value of that act to
[37:34] one of the children of God because they
[37:36] gave and the Lord received it in heaven
[37:39] and it could not be corrupted
[37:44] now for the part you all were waiting
[37:46] for
[37:49] the Old Testament
[37:52] and I want to address this in a little
[37:53] bit different light than we did before
[37:54] the Old Testament law regarding giving
[37:58] was very detailed and compulsory
[38:01] and it's there's a lot of details to it
[38:04] towards since it was a nation it was
[38:06] government there was a union of
[38:08] church and state in Israel right I mean
[38:11] this is there was only one religion
[38:13] there was only one God there was only
[38:14] one temple one place of worship and this
[38:16] was you know this is by nationality by
[38:18] religion it was all unified and Blended
[38:20] so there's a lot of different details
[38:22] and consequences uh that could be held
[38:25] in the Jewish religion but the Old
[38:28] Testament the law was very detailed on
[38:30] giving it was mandatory
[38:32] but yet it still holds a type for us
[38:34] absent some of the same details are the
[38:37] compulsion we looked at it last time I
[38:39] don't know if there's a slide there is
[38:40] there no there's not
[38:42] let me go back I thought maybe I had a
[38:44] slide on this we looked at the three
[38:46] different gifts or offerings or tithes
[38:49] in the Old Testament there's a tithe for
[38:50] the Levites there's a tithe for the
[38:52] annual festivals which is their feast
[38:54] offerings and then there was ties for
[38:56] the poor and we identified that very
[38:57] plainly in scripture the division of
[39:00] offerings that was belonged to the
[39:01] ministry in the Old Testament that
[39:03] belonged to the function of the
[39:04] Tabernacle and the worship and then the
[39:07] offerings that would be given to Aid the
[39:09] stranger the Immigrant and for those who
[39:11] did not have and some of you do you
[39:12] remember that can we go back nine months
[39:14] ago to that time we realized the
[39:16] scripture broke out each one of these
[39:18] tithes and then in Hebrews chapter 10
[39:20] verse 1 it says for the law having a
[39:22] shadow of good things to come and not
[39:24] the very image of things we could then
[39:27] see in parallel that new testament
[39:28] teaching the New Testament teaching on
[39:31] giving draws from this shadow
[39:34] in the Old Testament that even though
[39:36] it's not following it's strictly the
[39:38] same tithe to the Levites and tie this
[39:40] and all the same percentages and
[39:42] everything being very precise because
[39:45] numbers to where even Jesus and we'll
[39:47] get to in a moment was recognizing that
[39:48] they knew the number that this person
[39:51] ought to give and they measured these
[39:52] things and there was certain omers and
[39:54] ways that they valued what a house ought
[39:56] to be given and what they would need for
[39:58] their house
[39:59] but the law then gives an example of
[40:02] this image a shadow of tithe to the
[40:05] ministry offerings for the church and
[40:07] our gifts to missions
[40:08] and I want to address this not that it
[40:11] would be an elephant in the room and
[40:12] some of you may not even be familiar
[40:13] with this but many argue
[40:15] that tithing is not a new testament
[40:17] principle and that it only applies under
[40:19] the law that under the law and to this
[40:21] church and state Union to the Jews and
[40:24] even in Israel today that they would
[40:25] acknowledge that this only applies to
[40:27] Israel this only applies to those who
[40:29] are under the law and if the law has
[40:31] been superseded by a New Covenant then
[40:34] tithe in is no longer
[40:35] um
[40:36] allowed or tithing is no longer
[40:39] something that God expects from us but
[40:42] it's important to note that tithing or
[40:44] giving an offering to the Lord from your
[40:46] increase originated before the law right
[40:49] and I'll just reference them very
[40:51] quickly in Genesis chapter 4 Cain and
[40:53] Abel made offerings
[40:55] unto the Lord from their increase from
[40:58] their first fruits so it mankind the
[41:01] First Act that we see from mankind post
[41:04] fall so that we can all relate to this
[41:07] isn't Garden of Eden condition this
[41:09] isn't Israelite a covenant tradition
[41:11] this is the condition of Fallen Humanity
[41:14] Abel receives a revelation that God
[41:16] wants first fruits
[41:18] that God wants something reserved for
[41:20] him and praise and worship and as an
[41:21] offering to the Lord and this offering
[41:23] here in Genesis 4 is a gift or a tribute
[41:25] a present something to worship God and
[41:27] so the image of giving of your increase
[41:29] was pre before the law but just uh
[41:34] memorialized and canonized and and
[41:37] ratified in the law like that's where it
[41:39] was just it was put in what God required
[41:42] and what God expected they just put was
[41:45] put in the written law but it wasn't
[41:46] that that's where it started and that's
[41:48] where it ends because in Genesis chapter
[41:50] 14 in the Bible says that Abraham gave
[41:54] him tithes of all to Melchizedek
[41:57] not by law
[41:59] not by compulsion
[42:01] amen but by worship
[42:03] as an act of Thanksgiving he did it so
[42:06] it shows
[42:07] that the the unction to give and the
[42:10] desire to give from what we have is not
[42:13] a legal requirement and it's not
[42:15] something that is inspired by the law
[42:17] but it's something that was prior to the
[42:20] law that God receives and will blast
[42:22] even after the law has been perfected
[42:26] and if you look for the word tithing in
[42:29] the New Testament you won't find it in
[42:30] New Testament teaching of the writers of
[42:32] the letters and some argue that tithing
[42:34] is not in the New Testament
[42:36] uh despite the explicit teaching to get
[42:40] be give to to give and so and you say
[42:43] well where do you learn about this stuff
[42:44] I talk to people
[42:47] I occasionally research
[42:49] and in that you'll find a lot of hot
[42:53] opinions on tithing right a lot of
[42:55] really strong forceful arguments about
[42:57] it's not even god-like it's not even
[42:59] Christian you know anyway it tells you
[43:01] ought to tithe is of the devil and just
[43:03] trying to take advantage of you and um
[43:05] and so there's a there's a real strong
[43:08] opinions in this area and they'll say
[43:10] that it that the New Testament is clear
[43:12] you ought to give you have to give
[43:14] generously they're quick to identify all
[43:17] the places that God says to give and
[43:19] even some of them are even willing to
[43:20] acknowledge that Paul clearly identifies
[43:23] that giving to him and giving to the
[43:25] ministry in feet and giving to the ox
[43:27] that labors and everything is that form
[43:30] of tithing it's the same thing that
[43:31] would be referenced in the Old Testament
[43:33] they said but tithing is not a new
[43:35] testament principle
[43:36] but in Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 this
[43:39] is the only place you'll find tithe in
[43:41] the New Testament I believe
[43:47] and I I say I believe just because I
[43:49] preached a sermon one time and I made
[43:50] the comment
[43:51] that Lot's wife is one of the only women
[43:55] in the Bible that's mentioned in both
[43:56] the Old Testament the New Testament we
[43:58] don't know her name I think it was one
[43:59] of two and then I was done preaching
[44:01] this masterpiece at 21 years old or
[44:02] whatever it's one of my first few
[44:04] sermons and the preacher got up behind
[44:06] me and says we actually do know lot's
[44:07] wife's name and I'm like
[44:09] how did I miss this
[44:11] and he said it was Anita
[44:13] I need a lot and I was like oh okay all
[44:16] right
[44:17] like are you a dad because that sounds
[44:20] like a dad joke
[44:22] and so
[44:24] this um
[44:26] I said I was 21 years old couldn't have
[44:28] been 21. I was older than that but
[44:31] um I definitely wasn't a dad so I didn't
[44:32] get the joke
[44:34] now it's hilarious
[44:38] but
[44:40] it's so in Matthew chapter 23 verse 23
[44:42] this is an important scripture for us to
[44:44] acknowledge he says woe unto your
[44:45] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you
[44:48] paid tithe of mint and anise and cumin
[44:51] and have omitted the weightier matters
[44:53] of the law judgment mercy and Faith now
[44:56] here's an opportunity for Christ who's
[44:58] magnifying the law to disavow
[45:02] this law
[45:03] this is his opportunity to say but I say
[45:05] unto you don't tithe anymore this is his
[45:08] opportunity to let us know and signal to
[45:10] us as Christians who will be following
[45:12] him in the New Covenant what his
[45:13] attitude is towards tithing and he says
[45:15] these ought you to have done
[45:18] and not leave the other undone
[45:21] so when given an opportunity to
[45:22] explicitly disavow tithing he affirms it
[45:26] and he's saying that you ought to have
[45:27] tithe you ought to have given this you
[45:29] ought to have done and to do the other
[45:31] showing his brother Brenham often does
[45:32] on the subject of tithing and attending
[45:34] church because in a lot of the quotes
[45:36] where he says you should tithe you
[45:37] should go to church he's saying but that
[45:39] doesn't make you a Christian and in one
[45:41] moment I've caused all of you to be like
[45:42] well wait a minute what
[45:44] because there's this other part to it be
[45:46] inoculated first be filled with the Holy
[45:48] Ghost don't and I think we started that
[45:50] in the very beginning we said this is
[45:52] all based upon the understanding that
[45:54] you have been sealed into the kingdom of
[45:56] God and now he wants to set your path
[45:58] straight now he wants to establish your
[46:00] going so having been filled with this
[46:02] Holy Spirit and I'm not doing this to
[46:04] make myself a Christian I'm doing this
[46:05] because I am a Christian I'm not doing
[46:08] this to be a beneficiary of God's grace
[46:09] I'm doing this as a recipient of God's
[46:12] grace then this is something we do so
[46:14] he's saying that this is this giving now
[46:17] is I I am not doing this to make myself
[46:20] a Christian I'm not doing this to just
[46:23] check the box Jesus saying but you ought
[46:25] to do it because it's required of you
[46:29] to pay tithe
[46:31] and to do all these other things these
[46:33] things you ought to have done not just
[46:35] do the one and leave the other undone
[46:36] now the argument is that this very
[46:38] statement the scriptures before the
[46:40] institution of the New Covenant
[46:42] now how many can just very easily
[46:44] recognize the danger in doing that
[46:47] he affirmed tithing before the
[46:48] institution of the New Covenant I would
[46:50] say it's ill-advised because everything
[46:52] he taught that practically was before
[46:55] the institution of the New Covenant so I
[46:57] say wow this is before he died and rose
[46:59] again this is before his Spirit was sent
[47:00] back then it kind of just gives us this
[47:03] white out that we can begin to use over
[47:05] so many things that Jesus taught
[47:07] that were before the institution of the
[47:10] New Covenant
[47:11] and if you lean that way it becomes a
[47:13] means of rejecting any teaching of
[47:15] Christ prior to his death and
[47:16] Resurrection
[47:17] so when it comes to the law then Jesus
[47:19] says in Matthew 5 17 think thought that
[47:21] I'm come to destroy the law or the
[47:23] prophets I'm come to I'm come not to
[47:26] just I am not come to destroy but to
[47:28] fulfill
[47:29] so he's not come just to tear down the
[47:32] law and destroy it but to give it to
[47:34] make sense of it
[47:36] to fill it up to place it to give it
[47:38] purpose he came not to take the law and
[47:41] destroy it but what did Paul do in
[47:43] Romans and Hebrews he it made sense of
[47:45] the law
[47:46] it made sense of the sacrifices and the
[47:49] arrangement of the temple it all began
[47:50] to make sense once Christ came that
[47:52] these were all shadows and pre-figures
[47:55] and so Christ didn't come to abolish the
[47:57] law destroy the law we often say
[47:59] that he came and magnified the law
[48:02] in Matthew chapter 6 and The Sermon on
[48:04] the Mount he addresses six different Old
[48:06] Testament laws I say unto you Thou shalt
[48:08] is said unto you before time thou shall
[48:10] not kill and then what do you say hey if
[48:13] you if you even uh if you say something
[48:16] the wrong way and speak against your
[48:18] brother and you call him a fool you're
[48:20] in danger of Hellfire if said before
[48:21] thou shall not commit adultery but if
[48:23] any man look upon a woman to lust after
[48:24] he has committed already what did Jesus
[48:26] do he didn't abolish the law he found
[48:29] the intent and the spirit of the law
[48:32] because the Jews could be very good at
[48:34] technical compliance but their heart
[48:36] being far from God so in other words
[48:38] Paul Jesus breaks this down if you go
[48:41] and read the sermon on the mountain you
[48:42] read all these references to the laws
[48:43] read it this way that Jesus is eliciting
[48:47] the spirit of the law not just the
[48:48] letter
[48:49] so you read the letter of the law he's
[48:51] saying now what I want you to see Jesus
[48:53] in other words he's saying that he's
[48:54] opening up and revealing the intent of
[48:57] the law the real meaning of the law in
[48:59] other words Jesus is saying this law was
[49:02] not meant to for technical compliance
[49:04] but it's meant to address our hearts and
[49:06] our actions
[49:08] so the letter of the law we may say is
[49:10] abolished but the spirit of the law
[49:11] survives
[49:13] there's some things in law that we don't
[49:14] we don't apply by letter and Jesus
[49:16] acknowledging this says it has been said
[49:18] before Thou shalt not do this thou shall
[49:20] not do this or Thou shalt do this and as
[49:22] much as the law was going to transition
[49:23] and change into Grace Jesus saying the
[49:25] spirit of the law survives under grace
[49:30] and as one of the one of the things
[49:32] you'll find in what Jesus addresses is
[49:33] he never addresses the law of tithing
[49:35] because it wasn't even an issue it
[49:36] wasn't even debated
[49:38] there was no question they're so
[49:40] explicit under the law the teaching of
[49:42] it and the reasons for it and the
[49:43] meaning behind it but one thing we can
[49:45] say for sure there's absolutely zero New
[49:48] Testament teaching that rejects the law
[49:49] of tithing
[49:51] so now it it kind of had come to our
[49:53] home stretch to finish here and I
[49:55] appreciate your attentiveness despite
[49:57] the the fluctuation of the temperature
[49:59] uh you there it's not because we have
[50:01] the heat on because we broke the
[50:02] thermostat and the heat don't work
[50:04] so I know it's not because well unless
[50:06] the all of a sudden it's working
[50:08] uh but uh I'd like to ask this question
[50:11] to you then or maybe this begs the
[50:13] question well then how is the New
[50:14] Testament giving and teaching the New
[50:16] Testament giving different from the Old
[50:18] Testament and and I want to look at it
[50:21] in one regard
[50:22] that under the Old Testament law there
[50:24] are penalties
[50:25] for not tithing
[50:27] so there was a direct consequence
[50:29] explicit consequence in the Old
[50:31] Testament when God gave the law to
[50:33] Israel there was direct consequences if
[50:35] they did not give in their annual tithes
[50:38] their ties for Levites their ties for
[50:39] the feast offerings their tithes for the
[50:41] poor just go to Deuteronomy 26 27 28 and
[50:44] just look at all the curses and
[50:46] punishments that are given for not
[50:47] obeying the law and God is basically
[50:49] saying if you do not make Commandments
[50:51] this is what's going to happen to you
[50:52] the Malachi picks it up Malachi chapter
[50:54] 3 verses 8 9 will a man rob God and how
[50:56] is it they robbed him in their tithes
[50:58] and offerings you have yet Rob yet you
[51:00] have robbed me but you say where and
[51:02] have we robbed the in tithes and
[51:03] offerings and because of that these are
[51:05] the words of the Lord you are cursed
[51:07] with a curse for you have robbed me even
[51:09] this whole nation
[51:10] now this is under the law and this is to
[51:13] Israel that in their failure to pay
[51:14] tithes and offerings they are cursed
[51:16] because their failure to pay tithes and
[51:18] offerings robbed god of what he legally
[51:21] required under the law
[51:23] but then God brings out the other part
[51:24] and Malachi didn't want to spend too
[51:26] much attention on this but try me give
[51:29] and this is not just a matter of me not
[51:31] cursing you I'll pour out a blessing
[51:33] upon you that you cannot contain because
[51:35] that's the real emphasis that God had in
[51:37] the law to begin with is honor the Lord
[51:39] with your substance honor him with your
[51:41] increase and your barns will be full and
[51:43] your wine press is overflowing just give
[51:45] and I'm going to give this is God God
[51:47] loves a cheerful Giver just give but
[51:49] there was consequences under the law and
[51:51] there was a curse that they failed to
[51:53] give and Jesus did what Paul teaches us
[51:55] in Galatians that Christ has redeemed us
[51:58] from the curse of the law
[52:00] so I believe in having studied the
[52:02] message I do not find anywhere where
[52:04] brother Branham is using the explicit
[52:06] language that you better tithe or you'll
[52:08] be cursed
[52:09] but he does say that if you give try me
[52:12] try me this is a blessing this is a
[52:14] promise that comes with the blessing
[52:15] this is God saying try me I will pour
[52:17] out a blessing that you cannot contain
[52:19] and I would say but the blessing remains
[52:21] under grace
[52:23] and is established in the New Testament
[52:24] teaching as we've already seen
[52:27] and I'll say this and this may come as a
[52:29] relief to a lot of you
[52:31] as a church there is no mechanism to
[52:34] enforce tithing or punish those who
[52:35] don't
[52:38] right why did you wait till 11 45 to
[52:41] tell us this
[52:42] there's just there's just no way there's
[52:44] there's no mechanism this church doesn't
[52:46] have it and when I say that there's no I
[52:48] don't have
[52:49] I don't have the right to for
[52:51] intimidation
[52:52] or or to make you feel ashamed that's
[52:56] not my right and I'll and and you hold
[52:58] me accountable if I ever try to shame
[53:00] you in doing something for God call me
[53:02] out on it because I don't have that
[53:03] right
[53:05] just don't have it try to bully you
[53:07] intimidate you make you feel
[53:08] uncomfortable use what we call the the
[53:11] spirit has always been there and the
[53:13] actions have always been there but now
[53:14] it has new label of cancel culture
[53:16] churches have practiced canceled culture
[53:20] before the politicians ever figured it
[53:22] out
[53:23] we were the we invented it
[53:26] Christians invented cancel culture and
[53:28] so we've experienced it in the message
[53:30] in Christianity how quickly we can
[53:32] ostracize somebody and kick somebody out
[53:34] when they don't align with us exactly
[53:35] the way we want them to this church
[53:37] doesn't have that ability
[53:39] we simply do not have at our disposal
[53:42] enforcement mechanisms and ways of
[53:44] punishing people who don't pay their
[53:46] tithes
[53:48] truthfully I would say that in some ways
[53:51] that we we count on your disclosure when
[53:54] you give your offerings and you give
[53:55] your tithes to give you a receipt at the
[53:57] end of the year and to know who's giving
[53:58] tithes but there's no means by which we
[54:01] can access the you know your your yeah
[54:03] send a I guess legally I could probably
[54:05] figure out some way to Garner your wages
[54:08] right
[54:09] and and legally I have to have 10 of his
[54:12] salary so hey you know sorry Joel but
[54:15] you know whenever your employer calls me
[54:16] I'm like um I have this uh subpoena here
[54:19] to Garner 10 of his wages and you know
[54:22] just like Hey listen you guys object to
[54:25] vaccines on a religious basis why not
[54:27] let us as a church take 10 of your grows
[54:32] for religious reasons right think about
[54:35] it
[54:36] I think we're getting somewhere with
[54:37] this today now we don't have that means
[54:39] of auditing so if you whatever you give
[54:42] you're the one that knows that you're
[54:44] giving generously giving consistently
[54:46] given from the as to the Lord we don't
[54:47] have a means of getting your income tax
[54:50] statements unless you want to run for
[54:51] public office we just won't see them
[54:53] we won't be able to verify it so you
[54:56] there's nothing in this church where we
[54:58] have some mechanism that they had in the
[54:59] Old Testament to be able to enforce this
[55:01] giving
[55:02] brother Brown even answers it this way
[55:04] and God being misunderstood he's asked
[55:05] this question can a Christian go to
[55:07] heaven if he or she does not pay tithe
[55:11] I could not say yes or no to that it's a
[55:13] very good very good answer
[55:17] he says but I do I do believe that every
[55:19] Christian is obligated to pay tithings
[55:21] because it is a commandment of the Lord
[55:25] and blessed are they that do all his
[55:27] Commandments that they might have a
[55:28] right to enter into the life the tree of
[55:31] life now what an amazing connection he
[55:33] just makes
[55:35] now I do believe that tithe pain is
[55:37] essential to a Christian experience
[55:38] you'll find that this Echoes his
[55:40] sentiments from 47 to 65. he echoed the
[55:43] sentiment over and over and over again
[55:44] but when asked about whether or not it
[55:46] would keep somebody out of the kingdom
[55:47] of God he says I couldn't say yes or no
[55:49] to that why because there's a whole lot
[55:51] more to it than just paying your tithes
[55:53] a whole lot more to it
[55:55] and what brother Branham identifies is
[55:57] that the failure to give limits God's
[55:59] blessings
[56:01] now you're saying Hey give it's a
[56:03] commandment and you'll have this right
[56:04] there's a blessing that comes with it
[56:05] and we do recognize and I want to
[56:07] address this very quickly before we try
[56:09] to wrap this up that that the only
[56:13] consequence of your giving
[56:16] is if you limit your giving or don't
[56:19] give at all then it can limit your
[56:20] ability to be a blessing to people
[56:23] you limit your ability to be a blessing
[56:24] to church limit your ability to serve
[56:26] limit your ability to participate limit
[56:28] the the blessing that you are to other
[56:30] people
[56:31] because this is I share this as the
[56:32] standard that we hold at this church and
[56:34] the placing of deacons brother remember
[56:35] says in the church are those because
[56:37] he's talking about placing of deacons he
[56:39] says and the church are those who come
[56:40] and support the church with their
[56:42] presence with their tithes and offerings
[56:46] and he says those are the ones that have
[56:47] a legal say so in the voting of or in
[56:49] the placing of such or deacons so those
[56:51] who attend church regularly and those
[56:54] that pay their tithes and offerings are
[56:56] the ones who have a right to vote on the
[56:58] placing of deacons and trustees in any
[57:00] office that would be voted for he comes
[57:02] back to it later when he's actually
[57:03] wanting the vote he says every member of
[57:05] this church that comes here regular and
[57:07] supports it with your tithe and
[57:08] offerings which is considered a member
[57:10] of this church
[57:11] and so this is what's required to vote
[57:13] so you say well is there a penalty for
[57:15] not paying tithes or offerings then this
[57:17] is not necessarily a penalty but it's a
[57:19] lack of privilege
[57:21] that those that attend regularly and pay
[57:22] their tithes and offerings they are the
[57:24] ones that are given the opportunity to
[57:26] vote and I would say this is what we
[57:28] require as a church to vote and it's
[57:30] very beautiful that if you would be
[57:32] that's what's required to vote that's
[57:34] the requirement to hold an office
[57:37] right that's what's required to serve in
[57:39] a official capacity and maybe the Lord
[57:42] will give me opportunity maybe it's in
[57:43] the month of February we'll start
[57:44] talking about the next level because
[57:45] everything we're talking about now is
[57:47] just entry level
[57:48] the entry level requirements these are
[57:51] things that we all must be doing if
[57:52] you've had a new birth experience you
[57:54] attend church regularly you pay your
[57:55] tithes and offerings you support
[57:56] missions you sanctify your home you
[57:58] gather around the world you live for
[57:59] others you're putting yourself position
[58:00] then to go to the next level
[58:03] because those first seven that's what
[58:05] every believer has that's what every
[58:06] believer does but then you have this
[58:08] opportunity for your own particular
[58:10] gifts and your own particular callings
[58:12] and the Very things that God wants to do
[58:14] in your life though that's when you have
[58:16] an opportunity to move into Ministry
[58:17] move into service and move into other
[58:19] areas where God wants to take these
[58:21] special unique gifts that you have and
[58:23] use them for his glory and that's the
[58:25] best way for them to be used the best
[58:28] way for your gift to be a curse to you
[58:30] and to others is to not have these other
[58:32] seven in your life and try to use it
[58:37] and I know some of you seen it there's
[58:39] some people that don't go to church
[58:41] unless they going to be playing an
[58:43] instrument or don't go unless they're
[58:44] preaching or singing or something and
[58:45] they only show up when they want to
[58:47] serve
[58:49] but they don't have these other
[58:50] disciplines and habits in their lives
[58:51] and it only limits the effectiveness of
[58:53] this beautiful gift they have
[58:56] because giving shows support
[58:58] demonstrates a confidence and Trust
[59:01] not just
[59:03] not just in the church you're a part of
[59:05] but in God
[59:07] and consistent giving demonstrates
[59:09] faithfulness
[59:10] brother Branham the sermon let us see
[59:11] God he says I feel like this that a
[59:13] member of a church
[59:14] their first obligation is with their
[59:16] tithe and offerings is to support their
[59:17] Church
[59:18] if you're members of These Fine churches
[59:20] that's represented here you support your
[59:23] church that's your first duty to God
[59:26] something brother Branham is consistent
[59:28] and mentioned over and over and over
[59:29] again support your church that's your
[59:31] first duty to God
[59:33] because if you're not if you're not
[59:34] attending service regularly and I
[59:37] apologize
[59:38] if me saying these things you say well
[59:40] that really goes without saying brother
[59:41] Aaron you don't need to say it I just
[59:43] feel compelled to say it
[59:45] that in these things that not doing
[59:47] these things
[59:49] could indicate a lack of faith
[59:51] like why why does why do some people not
[59:54] participate in feet washing and
[59:56] communion it could be a lack of faith
[59:58] why don't they attend church regularly
[1:00:00] why don't they go to church it could
[1:00:01] indicate a lack of faith
[1:00:03] or it could show a lack of confidence
[1:00:06] or an unwillingness to support so these
[1:00:08] are things that at least it begs the
[1:00:10] question right like well it's not fair
[1:00:12] to say just because I never go to church
[1:00:13] and never pay my tithes I don't support
[1:00:15] you it's like well
[1:00:18] you could at least forgive me if I
[1:00:20] thought that right
[1:00:24] I don't come to church because I don't
[1:00:25] like you brother Ernest I don't like
[1:00:27] Christ I'm like oh
[1:00:28] okay I feel better now
[1:00:30] not really but
[1:00:32] it really does indicate a lack of
[1:00:34] support or lack of faith does that not
[1:00:36] make sense
[1:00:37] and so if you're looking for people who
[1:00:39] have common vision and common goals and
[1:00:40] wanting to support something and support
[1:00:42] a cause and and and you feel that love
[1:00:45] and that we're in this together and
[1:00:47] whatever challenges come up when all
[1:00:49] this need is arising you know there's
[1:00:50] other like-minded people you can bind
[1:00:52] together and you can share one another's
[1:00:54] family there's such a a a there's such a
[1:00:57] confidence that comes when someone
[1:00:58] indicates faith in the word of God by
[1:01:00] being obedient to his word and then
[1:01:03] support for the things of God where
[1:01:04] you're laboring by doing the same thing
[1:01:07] brother Brandon the sermon why and I
[1:01:09] actually think I know this one is from
[1:01:11] from Phoenix and the last one may
[1:01:13] actually have been or one of these other
[1:01:14] ones may have been in Phoenix he says
[1:01:15] but I believe that every person should
[1:01:17] join the church I absolutely believe
[1:01:19] that every person should stand at their
[1:01:21] post of Duty when their pastors there
[1:01:23] preaching or evangelist or something I
[1:01:25] think they ought to stand at their post
[1:01:27] of Duty
[1:01:29] they so if uh if it's whether it's me
[1:01:31] preaching or a visiting minister or
[1:01:34] another minister of the part of our body
[1:01:35] is preaching we consider this our post
[1:01:37] of Duty in other words if the pastor is
[1:01:40] not preaching you're not relieved of
[1:01:42] your post to duty you don't all of a
[1:01:44] sudden freelance now
[1:01:45] you're all welcome to visit other
[1:01:47] churches and I love it that our church
[1:01:49] has that Liberty to visit and some of
[1:01:51] you are uh do more uh more regularly
[1:01:53] have places you visit and you show
[1:01:55] support and you have that Liberty to go
[1:01:56] to meetings um there's even people who
[1:01:58] aren't here this morning I believe that
[1:01:59] are visiting other churches and showing
[1:02:01] that uh that that kindness I think it's
[1:02:03] beautiful I think it's great I think
[1:02:06] it's great if we have that testimony as
[1:02:08] Believers is that we can fellowship and
[1:02:11] we can have harmony with other people
[1:02:13] and and we could find some common ground
[1:02:15] and but yet there's still this sense
[1:02:17] that it should never be that oh well if
[1:02:19] the pastor is not preaching our
[1:02:20] loyalties then are we can be anywhere we
[1:02:22] want there should always be this thought
[1:02:24] in our heart that this is my that's
[1:02:25] where I belong this in its home because
[1:02:27] that's where I end up back when I'm done
[1:02:30] visiting but he says support that church
[1:02:32] with everything they have to stand to
[1:02:33] positive they ought to support that
[1:02:35] church with everything that got in them
[1:02:38] with their ties with their offerings
[1:02:40] with anything that they're called on to
[1:02:43] do be willing and happy it says if your
[1:02:45] pastor asks you to do something in your
[1:02:47] church you should do it that's good all
[1:02:49] right everybody write that down
[1:02:52] here comes the ask I'm learning to be a
[1:02:53] Salesman right there's got to be an ask
[1:02:55] I'm just kidding
[1:02:56] I'm a horrible salesman I can't even
[1:02:58] return a steak you know that hasn't been
[1:03:00] cooked right because I just I'm really
[1:03:02] backwards about them like Elizabeth say
[1:03:03] something
[1:03:05] tell him my steak's overcooked I'd I
[1:03:08] would be poor if I had to rely on sales
[1:03:11] I just can't I can't do the ask
[1:03:13] but be well and happy if your pastor
[1:03:15] asks you to do something in church you
[1:03:17] should do it that's good
[1:03:21] I believe that this
[1:03:23] I think this indicates if I could just
[1:03:24] kind of wrap it up the Old Testament
[1:03:27] had explicit curses and punishments
[1:03:30] I believe the Old Testament is just full
[1:03:31] of blessing and privilege
[1:03:34] that if you give God will bless you and
[1:03:36] measure to what you give and it opens up
[1:03:39] Privileges and opportunities you
[1:03:40] otherwise don't have
[1:03:42] the otherwise that you wouldn't even be
[1:03:43] given except for your participation in
[1:03:46] God's economy
[1:03:47] and that these things show what side
[1:03:49] you're on and who and not necessarily
[1:03:51] that your loyalty is into a particular
[1:03:53] manner to a church but that this is your
[1:03:55] your loyalties to God and this is what
[1:03:57] God would expect of you
[1:03:59] and so I believe that the Bible teaches
[1:04:01] us to be consistent happy generous
[1:04:03] givers
[1:04:05] as unto the Lord
[1:04:07] and we do that in part through our
[1:04:09] tithes and offerings
[1:04:10] it says in first Timothy 6 18 and I'm
[1:04:12] closing here with just two more
[1:04:13] scriptures so that they do good after
[1:04:15] this there's only two more so three if
[1:04:16] you include this one that they do good
[1:04:18] that they be rich in Good Works ready to
[1:04:21] distribute willing to communicate
[1:04:24] policy and be free givers
[1:04:26] ready to give and not cleaving to
[1:04:28] possessions
[1:04:30] that if you have
[1:04:32] if you have and God gives and have some
[1:04:34] sense
[1:04:35] of that I'm willing to give of what I've
[1:04:38] been given
[1:04:40] Paul said I I will gladly spend and be
[1:04:42] spent
[1:04:44] and what we have we have from the Lord
[1:04:45] our position sister Elizabeth and I are
[1:04:48] our vision and our position here is uh
[1:04:50] in this church and our leadership in the
[1:04:52] church is that whoever God sends here we
[1:04:55] take full responsibility in serving them
[1:04:59] and and looking out after them
[1:05:01] spiritually and praying for them and
[1:05:02] willing to provide in whatever way that
[1:05:04] we possibly can we're willing to spend
[1:05:06] and be spent but we take no ownership
[1:05:09] such that if God would take them and
[1:05:11] move them on they go with our blessing
[1:05:13] and there is no loss and there's not we
[1:05:16] have not been deprived because we never
[1:05:18] owned them to begin with
[1:05:20] and that Believers here have absolute
[1:05:22] autonomy and Liberty to serve God as
[1:05:24] they would see fit and if they feel led
[1:05:26] to move and God moves them then though
[1:05:28] there could be some sense of loss and
[1:05:29] sorrow in our heart that's not what we
[1:05:31] own and it's not our possession so even
[1:05:33] in that we are willing to give that
[1:05:35] others could be blessed
[1:05:37] and I could say that about everyone here
[1:05:39] that if God would lead you to attend
[1:05:40] another assembly I could say they are
[1:05:43] going to be blessed and we have a part
[1:05:45] in it
[1:05:47] because we ought to be free givers even
[1:05:49] as a church
[1:05:51] I found it interesting as I studied all
[1:05:53] these that God
[1:05:55] get God could have required
[1:05:58] giving in the New Testament under the
[1:06:00] New Covenant as compulsory mandatory and
[1:06:03] explicit even to a certain amount
[1:06:05] could have done it
[1:06:07] but what God did is he allowed it
[1:06:10] to be done of your own free will
[1:06:14] it's written that way and it's
[1:06:15] remarkable as I studied and I studied
[1:06:16] the message and Brother Band is very
[1:06:18] forceful on it he's very particular and
[1:06:20] then I read the I read the Old Testament
[1:06:23] and I read the New Testament and I find
[1:06:25] that God is very clear that you ought to
[1:06:26] be givers
[1:06:28] and and some argue that there's no such
[1:06:30] thing as a cash
[1:06:31] uh cash giving or giving of money and
[1:06:34] it's like I guess they don't believe the
[1:06:35] Old Testament either
[1:06:37] because in the Old Testament there was
[1:06:38] always the means by which you could give
[1:06:40] through cash
[1:06:42] and so I think we've even read it before
[1:06:43] how there was those who could not have
[1:06:46] and partake and provide through some
[1:06:47] sort of substance could actually give of
[1:06:49] their money and the the money that they
[1:06:51] would have or the assets of currency
[1:06:52] that they would have they could give
[1:06:54] there's even a Leviticus that if you is
[1:06:57] the law is so amazingly detailed that if
[1:07:00] you are required to tithe a certain
[1:07:02] percentage of your grain you could
[1:07:04] actually buy back your offering redeem
[1:07:06] it by paying a percentage of it
[1:07:09] so if the value was a thousand dollars
[1:07:11] and that's what you owed in actual grain
[1:07:12] if you needed to keep that grain you
[1:07:14] could buy it for like twelve hundred
[1:07:15] dollars
[1:07:17] and and that would count as an offering
[1:07:19] so the whole idea that offerings and uh
[1:07:21] givings and first fruits is not meant to
[1:07:23] be cash in the Bible or even in the New
[1:07:25] Testament is just uh I believe it's it's
[1:07:28] just the wrong interpretation of
[1:07:29] scripture
[1:07:30] but God wants us to give of our own free
[1:07:33] will
[1:07:34] and but there's some if he could I
[1:07:38] believe God requires it but he doesn't
[1:07:40] make it mandatory
[1:07:42] if you I may I don't know if I'm saying
[1:07:43] it maybe the right way he could have
[1:07:45] made it by force he could have made it
[1:07:47] legally
[1:07:49] but he does it to be done of your own
[1:07:51] free will
[1:07:52] and so as your pastor I encourage you to
[1:07:54] give
[1:07:55] of your own free will as generously as
[1:07:57] you are able and to the Lord
[1:07:59] and I want to close with this in second
[1:08:00] Corinthians chapter eight I wanted to
[1:08:02] maybe make this part of our
[1:08:06] um
[1:08:07] our text and teaching but I just want to
[1:08:10] refer to this part so much more in here
[1:08:12] that could be
[1:08:13] um referred to
[1:08:15] he says therefore is ye abound in
[1:08:17] everything in faith and utterance and
[1:08:19] knowledge and in all diligence
[1:08:21] and he's talking about the Macedonian
[1:08:23] example of giving
[1:08:25] and the love uh the the love that Titus
[1:08:28] has for the Corinthian Church and so
[1:08:30] he's using the the example of others
[1:08:32] giving to encourage the Corinthians to
[1:08:34] likewise be givers he says as you have
[1:08:36] abounded everything in faith and
[1:08:37] utterance and knowledge and all
[1:08:38] diligence and in your love to us see
[1:08:39] that you abound in this Grace also and
[1:08:42] the grace he's talking about is in
[1:08:44] giving
[1:08:45] as you abound in these other things
[1:08:48] abound in this so that you may prove
[1:08:50] that your love is real and it goes
[1:08:51] beyond mere words
[1:08:53] he says I speak not by commandment but
[1:08:55] by occasion of the forwardness of others
[1:08:57] and to prove the sincerity of your love
[1:09:00] so he's asking them I can't compel You
[1:09:02] by law I'm not speaking this by
[1:09:04] commandment but I'm saying you're so
[1:09:05] faithful in these all these other areas
[1:09:07] why don't you abound in this Grace also
[1:09:09] by being givers so they may prove Your
[1:09:12] Love
[1:09:14] he says for you no and then it gives
[1:09:15] this example for you know the grace of
[1:09:17] our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was
[1:09:19] rich yet for your sakes he became poor
[1:09:21] that ye through his poverty might be
[1:09:23] rich
[1:09:25] do we not say that for God so loved the
[1:09:28] world he gave
[1:09:29] his only begotten son
[1:09:31] have any of you ever just thought about
[1:09:33] how God could have dealt with our sins
[1:09:36] I mean could he not have just said okay
[1:09:39] they're gone
[1:09:41] I mean he's God
[1:09:43] he orchestrated all this but yet God is
[1:09:46] one who makes himself known to the
[1:09:48] actions of others
[1:09:50] that it's just part of his essential
[1:09:51] character that if God wants to be a
[1:09:53] blessing to someone here and he's really
[1:09:55] wanting to bless you we could almost to
[1:09:58] 100 say that he's going to use somebody
[1:10:00] to do that
[1:10:03] there's going to be some means there's
[1:10:05] going to be some action there's gonna be
[1:10:06] somebody if somebody needs a burden bore
[1:10:07] then there's going to be somebody's
[1:10:09] going to do something to bear that
[1:10:10] burden so it's going to come through
[1:10:12] somebody's actions Brother Bear talks
[1:10:14] about a Revival he says the reason why
[1:10:16] we've had these healings and the reason
[1:10:18] why we've had the move of God such we
[1:10:19] have and he and he pulls back a curtain
[1:10:21] says because this person praying here
[1:10:23] where he talks about this person sitting
[1:10:24] there around a campfire praying all
[1:10:26] night and it's the act of that one
[1:10:29] person is what brought the Revival and
[1:10:31] you think well if God wants to have a
[1:10:33] Revival can't he just have a Revival
[1:10:36] if God wants to bless me can it just be
[1:10:38] poof it's there but even when it came to
[1:10:41] atoning for our sins God himself gave
[1:10:45] he gave and Jesus Christ himself gave
[1:10:48] and became poor that we might be rich
[1:10:50] therefore it necessitates that in order
[1:10:52] for God's generosity and God's love and
[1:10:54] God's charity and his love even for you
[1:10:57] and for others has to be expressed
[1:10:59] through us our overt actions
[1:11:04] and we prove that God's love is real
[1:11:07] when we abound in disgrace also and
[1:11:09] Paul's specifically talking about giving
[1:11:12] and then he says this and this is I'm
[1:11:14] closing on this thought and so as far as
[1:11:15] our preaching part we've just been about
[1:11:17] an hour and 15 minutes
[1:11:18] it says a second Corinthians chapter 8
[1:11:20] verse 15 now
[1:11:21] as it is written
[1:11:24] he that had gathered much had nothing
[1:11:26] over
[1:11:28] and he that had gathered little Had No
[1:11:30] Lack
[1:11:32] almost reads like a riddle
[1:11:34] go back and read it in the scripture the
[1:11:36] miracle in Exodus 16 18. it was in the
[1:11:37] Gathering of manna
[1:11:40] and they went out to gather the manna
[1:11:42] and it says in that verse 18 essentially
[1:11:45] this he that gathered much had nothing
[1:11:46] over and he that gathered little little
[1:11:47] Had No Lack
[1:11:51] think about that
[1:11:53] Paul is using this this miracle
[1:11:56] to get the attention of the Corinthians
[1:11:58] as he continues in chapter nine and
[1:12:00] there's so much uh so much in here that
[1:12:02] he's expressing to them about giving and
[1:12:04] giving and giving
[1:12:06] and the if you even followed the track
[1:12:08] of Paul uh in his teaching it's the
[1:12:12] giving part that builds even to the
[1:12:13] weapons of our Warfare
[1:12:15] and how God is uh and and having
[1:12:18] discernment about false teaching and
[1:12:20] different things it's a critical part of
[1:12:21] Christianity and he uses this phrase
[1:12:24] this scripture this miracle of
[1:12:25] collecting the Manna and so the what
[1:12:27] happened in Exodus chapter 16 is the the
[1:12:30] Omar that was required and the the
[1:12:32] measure that each man needed to feed his
[1:12:34] family
[1:12:36] he's saying that as they in the
[1:12:38] scripture when they went out and
[1:12:39] gathered there was people who gathered a
[1:12:41] lot
[1:12:42] and they seem to have so much abundance
[1:12:44] and there was people who went out and
[1:12:46] gathered much smaller amounts but when
[1:12:48] they went to measure them
[1:12:50] each one had the exact amount they
[1:12:53] needed
[1:12:54] for what was required
[1:12:56] and this was a miracle
[1:12:58] only God could do this because people
[1:13:00] are out there trying to get and grab and
[1:13:02] have as much as they can and then oh wow
[1:13:04] look at how much he has well let me
[1:13:06] measure this it's like he doesn't have
[1:13:07] one piece of Mana more than what he
[1:13:09] needed to defeat his family
[1:13:11] and the one that got just a little bit
[1:13:13] it wasn't like oh man you're short you
[1:13:15] needed more no he had just as much as he
[1:13:17] needed for what he had so whether they
[1:13:19] had gathered a little
[1:13:20] they had just enough for what they
[1:13:22] needed
[1:13:23] whether they had gathered a lot they had
[1:13:25] just enough for what they needed
[1:13:27] and if I could say it to you this way
[1:13:29] based upon the miracle in Exodus 16 and
[1:13:32] upon this this example of Christian
[1:13:34] giving in second Corinthians chapter 8
[1:13:36] that God has ordained for us a certain
[1:13:39] measure
[1:13:40] a certain measure of increase and a
[1:13:42] certain level of joy
[1:13:44] that this is what God has ordained for
[1:13:46] us
[1:13:47] and beyond that you will not find
[1:13:49] happiness
[1:13:51] this miracle of the Manna is what it
[1:13:53] teaches us that when a man gathered the
[1:13:55] miracle was that all that he gathered
[1:13:57] was what he need whether little or a lot
[1:13:59] and so what we gather and what we have
[1:14:02] beyond what you need will not bring you
[1:14:04] happiness
[1:14:06] and so if there's a measure of increase
[1:14:07] in a measure of Joy if you're always
[1:14:10] trying to get beyond that that's when
[1:14:12] you're going to feel a little less
[1:14:13] satisfied
[1:14:15] because whenever we keep or whatever we
[1:14:17] keep Beyond those measures and whatever
[1:14:19] we try to attain Beyond those measures
[1:14:20] it'll not only satisf not only will it
[1:14:23] not satisfy but it'll cause us to be
[1:14:25] uneasy
[1:14:28] it'll cause our emptiness
[1:14:30] and sometimes we express feelings of
[1:14:33] emptiness and dissatisfaction because we
[1:14:35] feel that we don't have enough but
[1:14:37] sometimes it's because we've tried to
[1:14:38] keep too much
[1:14:41] and what we've kept does not give us the
[1:14:44] satisfaction that we need and the only
[1:14:46] way that you'll achieve the stasis
[1:14:48] achieve the joy and achieve the sense of
[1:14:51] satisfaction is when you give
[1:14:53] enough to balance the measure
[1:14:58] does that make sense
[1:15:00] that God has ordained for us a measure
[1:15:02] of increase he's ordained that he has
[1:15:04] this way of saying that this is what you
[1:15:06] ought to have this is what you need and
[1:15:08] when we have The Sensational appetite to
[1:15:10] keep beyond what we need that's what
[1:15:12] actually causes the more to become a
[1:15:15] negative and cause us to be less
[1:15:17] satisfied and why is it when I was
[1:15:19] making this much money I was happier
[1:15:20] when my income was exponentially
[1:15:22] increased is because you're trying to
[1:15:24] use it for your own purposes in hoard it
[1:15:27] for your own purposes and that'll never
[1:15:28] make a Christian more happy
[1:15:32] because be gone beyond what God measures
[1:15:35] for us will never make us happy
[1:15:39] and whatever we keep Beyond it
[1:15:43] will never satisfy
[1:15:46] but actually cause emptiness
[1:15:49] so I encourage you as a church to be
[1:15:50] givers
[1:15:51] give us unto the Lord be willing be
[1:15:53] happy be generous
[1:15:55] from A Generous Heart and I promise you
[1:15:58] the Lord will bless you
[1:16:00] thank you for your patience today
[1:16:03] musicians you could come
[1:16:05] we can all Stand Together
