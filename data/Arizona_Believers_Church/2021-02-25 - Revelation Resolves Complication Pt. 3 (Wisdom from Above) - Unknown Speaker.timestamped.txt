[0:00] I'm going to be reading from First Kings
[0:01] chapter 3.
[0:03] First Kings chapter 3. And then uh I'd
[0:06] like to read verses 5 to 28. So it's
[0:09] little bit of a lengthy reading, but um
[0:12] it'll help us save time maybe a little
[0:14] bit later um in terms of not having to
[0:18] go back and read through some of this.
[0:20] And I know it's scriptures you're
[0:21] familiar with. So it'll just get us
[0:23] right on track. So first uh Kings
[0:26] chapter 3, we'll start with verse 5. In
[0:29] Gibian, the Lord appeared to Solomon in
[0:31] a dream by night. And God said, "Ask
[0:33] what I shall give thee." Wow. Wouldn't
[0:36] it be wonderful to have that dream? God
[0:38] says, "Whatever you want, you just ask."
[0:40] And Solomon said, "Thou hast showed unto
[0:42] thy servant David, my father, great
[0:44] mercy, according as he walked before
[0:47] thee in truth, and in righteousness, and
[0:51] an uprightness of heart with thee. and
[0:53] thou hast kept for him this great
[0:55] kindness that thou hast given him a son
[0:57] to sit on his throne as it is this day.
[1:01] And now, oh Lord my God, thou hast made
[1:03] thy servant king instead of David my
[1:05] father. And I am but a little child, and
[1:07] I know not how to go out or come in. And
[1:10] thy servant is in the midst of thy
[1:12] people, which thou hast chosen, a great
[1:14] people that cannot be numbered, nor
[1:16] counted for multitude. Give therefore
[1:18] thy servant an understanding heart to
[1:20] judge thy people that I may discern
[1:22] between good and bad. For who is able to
[1:25] judge this thy so great a people? And
[1:28] the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon
[1:30] had asked for this thing? And God said
[1:32] unto him, Because thou hast asked this
[1:34] thing, and hast not asked for thyself
[1:36] long life, neither hast asked riches for
[1:39] thyself, nor hast asked the life of
[1:40] thine enemies, but hast asked for thy
[1:42] thyself understanding to discern
[1:45] judgment. Behold, I have done according
[1:47] to thy words. Lo, I have given thee a
[1:50] wise and an understanding heart, so that
[1:52] there is none like thee before thee,
[1:54] neither after thee shall any arise like
[1:57] unto thee. And I have also given thee
[1:59] that which thou hast not asked, both
[2:01] riches and honor, so that there shall
[2:03] not be any among the kings like unto
[2:05] thee all thy days. And if thou wilt walk
[2:08] in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
[2:10] commandments, as thy father David did
[2:12] walk, then I will lengthen thy days."
[2:14] And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a
[2:16] dream. And he came to Jerusalem and
[2:18] stood before the ark of the covenant of
[2:20] the Lord, and offered up burnt
[2:21] offerings, and offered peace offerings,
[2:23] and made a feast to all his servants.
[2:25] And this is the immediately after this
[2:28] experience of this dream, and God ending
[2:30] him with this great wisdom, and
[2:31] promising this blessing upon him, this
[2:34] gives us insight to this wisdom. Then
[2:36] came there two women that were harlots
[2:38] unto the king, and stood before him. And
[2:41] one woman said,"Oh my Lord, I and this
[2:44] woman dwell in one house, and I was
[2:46] delivered of a child with her in the
[2:47] house. It came to pass the third day
[2:49] after that I was delivered that this
[2:51] woman was delivered also, and we were
[2:53] together. And there was no no stranger
[2:55] with us in the house, save we two in the
[2:57] house. And this woman's child died in
[2:59] the night, because she overlaid it." And
[3:01] she rose at midnight, and took my son
[3:03] from beside me, while thy handmade
[3:05] slept, and laid it in her bosom, and
[3:07] laid her dead child in my bosom. And
[3:10] when I rose in the morning to give my
[3:11] child suck, behold, it was dead. But
[3:13] when I had considered it in the morning,
[3:15] behold, it was not my son, which I did
[3:17] bear. And the other woman said, "Nay,
[3:19] but the living is my son, and the dead
[3:21] is is thy son." And this thing said,
[3:25] "And this said, no, but the dead is thy
[3:27] son, and the living is my son." Thus
[3:29] they spake before the king. Then said
[3:32] the king, "The one saith, this is my son
[3:34] that liveth, and thy son is dead." and
[3:36] the other saith, nay, but thy son is
[3:38] dead, and my son is living. And the king
[3:40] said, "Bring me a sword." And they
[3:42] brought a sword before the king. And the
[3:44] king said, "Divide the living child in
[3:46] two, and give half to the one, and half
[3:48] to the other." Then spake the woman
[3:50] whose the living child was unto the
[3:53] king. For her bowels yearned upon her
[3:55] son, and said, "Oh my lord, give her the
[3:58] living child, and no wise slay it." But
[4:01] the other said, Let it neither be mine
[4:02] nor thine, but divide it. Then the king
[4:05] answered and said, "Give her the living
[4:07] child and in no wise slay it. She is the
[4:10] mother thereof." And all Israel heard of
[4:13] the judgment which the king had judged,
[4:14] and they feared the king, for they saw
[4:16] that the wisdom of God was in him to do
[4:20] judgment, to do justice, to do right.
[4:23] You can be seated. My title is it's
[4:26] represented on the slide is uh part
[4:28] three on revelation resolves
[4:30] complication. So, I'm wanting our
[4:32] thoughts to be centered upon um the some
[4:37] of these principles that we've been
[4:38] sharing over the last few services
[4:40] building on now it's complicated and now
[4:42] how do we address complication? How are
[4:44] we going to navigate the chaos in the
[4:47] labyrinth that is natural life? And I
[4:50] want to give this subtitle, wisdom from
[4:52] above. And that this revelation that's
[4:55] resolving complication in our lives is a
[4:57] wisdom that comes from God. And so we're
[4:59] acknowledging that the Lord is the one
[5:02] that's going to give us what we need uh
[5:04] to resolve any complication that's in
[5:06] our life. We may speak it in the sense
[5:08] of just generally the complicated uh you
[5:12] know chaos that is le oysia but it's
[5:14] also for whatever individual experiences
[5:17] uh you're going through whatever trials
[5:19] you're facing or circumstances you find
[5:21] yourself in I believe that God can give
[5:23] you the revelation that you need to make
[5:26] the right decisions in whatever it is
[5:28] you're going through. And so we've been
[5:30] using Revelations chapter 3 to look at
[5:32] the spirit of Leodysia and how it's the
[5:35] lust for the wrong kind of knowledge and
[5:37] this desire for wealth for things to
[5:39] accumulate material possessions and that
[5:42] the spirit of Leodysia is only overcome
[5:45] by Christ. And so it's counsel to buy of
[5:48] me gold tried in the fire and have this
[5:51] spiritual revelation of the word. And
[5:53] then it even arrives at verse 20 that
[5:55] says behold I stand at the door and
[5:57] knock. So if there's an escape out of
[5:59] the labyrinth of Leodysia, ultimately
[6:01] it's for you to hear his voice and open
[6:04] up and for him to come into you and you
[6:06] into him and to s with him. And at the
[6:08] end of this Leodysian church age, that's
[6:10] what God has opened up to his elect is
[6:13] the privilege and opportunity of being
[6:14] in his divine presence uh feeding on the
[6:17] word of God to give us strength uh day
[6:19] by day to fly above the challenges and
[6:21] temptations of the flesh a and to uh and
[6:25] to ultimately triumph even over death.
[6:27] And that's the that's the vision that
[6:29] God gave the church in his address to
[6:31] Leodysia. And I'm wanting I I would like
[6:34] to impress this at the very beginning
[6:37] that as a believer you there there's
[6:39] something that God has empowered you
[6:41] with that we can rely upon and desire
[6:44] that it becomes first nature, first
[6:46] instinct. Uh we all have our reflexes
[6:48] and our knee-jerk reactions and the ways
[6:50] that we respond to things and that's
[6:52] generally the nature that we've received
[6:54] after our natural parents and the
[6:55] nurture we've received from our parents
[6:57] or the environment we're raised in and
[6:59] that's our first instinct. But the life
[7:01] that is quickened inside of you by the
[7:03] new birth, we want to yield to that more
[7:05] and more so that that becomes first
[7:07] nature. So that when you get sick, your
[7:09] first nature is say, "Well, I believe
[7:10] that by his stripes I'm healed." And
[7:13] though we are taught that your duty is
[7:14] to first go to your doctor and go to
[7:16] your doctor if you're sick, we're not
[7:18] doing that to abandon our faith, but we
[7:20] do it as an uh as an uh expression of
[7:23] our confidence that God uses doctors, he
[7:25] uses medicine, but yet we still have
[7:27] this belief that God is looking out
[7:29] after me. My my first nature is to trust
[7:31] God. And Paul says in Philippians
[7:33] chapter 2:5, "Let this mind be in you
[7:36] which was also in Christ Jesus."
[7:39] This mind Paul begins to describe in its
[7:41] humility. He thought it not robbery to
[7:43] be equal with God. That would suggest
[7:46] that it was not unlawful or something
[7:48] that was forbidden for him to be equal
[7:49] with God. And it also says that to be
[7:52] equal with God was not something easily
[7:53] grasped or swiped at or taken uh
[7:56] fraudulently or by advantage. But it
[7:59] begins to speak about the humility of
[8:01] Christ. But it wasn't just alone the
[8:04] humility. He's saying, "Let this mind be
[8:06] in you that was also in Christ Jesus."
[8:08] So, this is a letting or yielding. We
[8:10] want to have his mind. And wouldn't it
[8:12] be wonderful to look at every single
[8:14] situation, everything you go through,
[8:16] and you begin to compute it like Christ
[8:17] would.
[8:19] And every scenario, you're looking at it
[8:21] and and you have your voice in your
[8:22] head. I don't know about this, but all
[8:24] of a sudden, you just have this thought.
[8:25] You're like, Christ is thinking. Christ
[8:27] is rising up and kind of telling me how
[8:29] to approach this situation. I I believe
[8:31] we could take that promise literally to
[8:33] say, "Well, I want this mind to be in me
[8:36] as he humbled himself and he expressed
[8:38] God. I I want to do the same thing."
[8:41] Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:1
[8:43] 16, he's talking about the nature of man
[8:46] and we understand man because we have
[8:47] the spirit of man in us. But the spirit
[8:49] of God searches all things, yay, the
[8:51] deep things of God. And the natural man
[8:53] cannot know the things of God. But the
[8:56] man who's spiritual because he has the
[8:58] spirit of God he can know the things
[9:00] that are freely given by God. And he so
[9:02] he says for who hath the mind of the
[9:04] Lord that he may instruct him. So he's
[9:07] saying that you know who can judge God
[9:08] and who has the mind of the Lord to give
[9:10] God instruction to give God uh wisdom.
[9:13] But he says but we have the mind of
[9:14] Christ. And so we may not uh be in the
[9:18] position to advise God and we're not
[9:20] ones that would think we're more wise
[9:22] than God and we have a better idea than
[9:24] he does, but we have the mind of Christ.
[9:27] So it's a it's a letting this mind be in
[9:30] you. If you've been baptized into
[9:32] Christ, then you have put on Christ.
[9:34] There's an old way of thinking. There's
[9:35] a new way of thinking. There's a power
[9:37] that's available to us. Quickening power
[9:39] has come to us. You have quickening
[9:42] power that gives you discernment. You
[9:43] have quickening power that snatches you
[9:45] from death to life. You have quickening
[9:46] power that lets you see the promises of
[9:48] God coming to pass. And so the new birth
[9:51] brings the teacher on the inside. And
[9:54] having the teacher on the inside, it
[9:56] gives us power to live by this
[9:58] quickening power to live by. So I
[10:00] emphasize that just to uh have at the
[10:02] very beginning that when we begin to
[10:04] speak about wisdom, we're not talking
[10:05] about our own, but we're talking about
[10:07] the wisdom of God. As we read in
[10:10] Ephesians chapter 1:1 17, that the Lord
[10:12] of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
[10:15] glory, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[10:17] the Father of glory, may give unto you
[10:19] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[10:22] the knowledge of him. That this is
[10:24] something that uh uh grows inside of you
[10:28] that it increases and it accumulates the
[10:30] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
[10:32] knowledge of him going growing in
[10:34] greater depths of understanding of the
[10:36] nature of Christ and his mind. We have
[10:38] his mind. We know what he wants done
[10:40] with his word. We we know what his
[10:41] promises are. We know what his teachings
[10:43] are. We know what uh his nature. And we
[10:45] we can begin to identify it. And and let
[10:48] me say this just as the pool is so
[10:50] beautiful this evening and and you're
[10:52] very attentive. Many of our
[10:54] disappointments in our Christian walk
[10:56] with other people is because we want to
[10:58] see Christ and we don't see it.
[11:01] And it causes confusion. They think,
[11:03] "Well, I wanted to see Christ in this
[11:05] situation. I wanted to see Christ in
[11:06] leadership. and I I wanted to see Christ
[11:08] in my parents. I wanted to see Christ in
[11:10] my pastor. And yet, we're not getting
[11:12] Christ being reflected back at us. And
[11:14] we begin to wrestle and rationalize with
[11:16] it. And sometimes the worst thing we do
[11:17] is we actually think, well, I guess that
[11:19] just must be the nature of Christ. But
[11:21] that's what we're hungry to see is to
[11:23] see Christ, to know him, to know his
[11:25] nature, to know uh how he acts and how
[11:28] he responds. And that's really the
[11:30] hunger that we have. We desire to see
[11:32] Christ in others. And when we when we
[11:35] experience disappointments, when we look
[11:37] to leadership or those are whether it be
[11:39] a father figure, whether it be a
[11:41] particular ministry that you've been
[11:42] offended by or hurt by or abused by or
[11:45] even in your own family, if there's been
[11:46] a disappointment, don't place that on
[11:48] Christ.
[11:50] If you're not seeing Christ being
[11:51] reflected, it's wonderful that you
[11:53] recognize that. But then also remember
[11:55] that man will disappoint you. And it's
[11:57] important to not have a bitterness in
[11:59] your heart towards man and to not uh and
[12:02] not allow some root to defile your
[12:04] conscience. But realize man is man.
[12:05] He'll make mistakes. He'll disappoint.
[12:07] Uh but that's where a lot of our
[12:08] disappointments come from is we want to
[12:10] see Christ. We want to become more
[12:12] acquainted with him. We expect to be
[12:14] treated in a Christlike manner. And yet
[12:16] we're not. And it causes a lot of hurt
[12:18] or offense. And so that we don't make
[12:21] that mistake of treating others
[12:22] uncristlike. We need to grow grow in the
[12:25] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
[12:27] knowledge of him. And this is not
[12:30] religious fervor. This is not to become
[12:32] more religious or or more fanatical
[12:34] about a particular belief. This is not
[12:36] theological conviction. But this is
[12:37] power to live.
[12:39] This is the ability to really thrive.
[12:41] This is not becoming a Pharisee about
[12:44] the word of God. This is not becoming
[12:46] more strict about a particular code of
[12:48] conduct, but this is about Christ having
[12:50] preeminence in your heart and and a life
[12:53] being lived out inside of your heart.
[12:56] And we ended with James chapter 1 verse
[12:58] 5 on Sunday. And it says, "If any of you
[13:00] lack wisdom, is that what what we were
[13:03] arriving at? The spirit of wisdom and
[13:05] revelation in the knowledge of him."
[13:06] That revelation imparts to us knowledge,
[13:08] wisdom, understanding. And so if we ask,
[13:11] if we lack wisdom, he says, "Let them
[13:13] ask of God." And and so in this sense,
[13:17] none of us should ever make the excuse,
[13:19] well, I just don't have wisdom.
[13:22] Because he says, if you lack it, ask for
[13:23] it. And he'll give it to all men. Not
[13:25] just not stingily, but liberally.
[13:28] So he said, God, I really need I need
[13:30] wisdom times two. He says, you know
[13:32] what? I'll do better than that. I'll
[13:33] give it to you times three.
[13:34] Just as Solomon, he asked for wisdom.
[13:36] And God said, not only will I make you
[13:38] wise, but there won't be anyone ever
[13:39] wiser than you.
[13:40] You'll be the wisest man on earth.
[13:42] because you asked that, I will bless you
[13:44] uh with it it in in possessions and in
[13:46] wealth and in in glory of your your
[13:48] natural kingdom because it pleased God
[13:50] that Solomon asked. And so if you lack
[13:53] wisdom, he says, ask God. He'll give it
[13:54] to you liberally. He will not upgrade
[13:56] you. He He won't chide you. He won't
[13:59] rebuke you. He won't say that you're
[14:01] asking a miss. This is this is an ask
[14:03] that God will grant. And he says, "And
[14:05] it shall be given him." And this wisdom
[14:09] can apply to say, 'Lord, I just want to
[14:11] generally have more wisdom. I want to
[14:12] have more understanding. But this is
[14:14] wisdom for the moment you're in. This is
[14:16] wisdom for a decision. If you're facing
[14:18] decision, it's it's good to say, "Lord,
[14:21] I I need wisdom in this." Brother Tom
[14:24] Donaldson was just sharing with me that
[14:26] uh uh with just a decision that he had
[14:28] to make, he just said, "Lord, what's the
[14:29] right thing for me to do? How should I
[14:30] go about this?" And God gave him this
[14:32] wisdom on how to do it. And when he
[14:34] purposed in his heart to do that,
[14:35] everything else just began to line up
[14:37] because God gives the wisdom and then he
[14:39] stands behind that. The Bible says
[14:40] wisdom is justified of your children. In
[14:42] other words, that there's the proof of
[14:44] wisdom.
[14:46] There's the fruit of wisdom and it's the
[14:48] fruit of wisdom that justifies the
[14:49] wisdom. And you know when you have
[14:51] behaved wisely. You know when you have
[14:53] done the right thing. And so if you lack
[14:55] wisdom even for the moment, even for a
[14:58] decision that you're facing, ask God for
[15:00] it. Because as we've been saying, life
[15:03] is complex. Even without the
[15:05] complications,
[15:06] it's complex. So, we need God's wisdom
[15:08] to live life well.
[15:10] And life is complicated.
[15:13] And because it's complicated, it takes
[15:15] God's wisdom, a revelation to thrive in
[15:17] the midst of the chaos. And so, we need
[15:19] this wisdom. And this is what I want to
[15:21] begin to emphasize tonight, uh, is
[15:23] wisdom. And I am still looking at our
[15:26] relationships. And there's a lot of ways
[15:28] that you could just take this these this
[15:30] subject matter right here and apply it
[15:31] to love thy neighbor and who is my
[15:33] neighbor and how that we treat our
[15:35] fellow brethren and how we treat one
[15:36] another. But this we've been looking at
[15:39] simplicity versus not just complexity
[15:42] but complication
[15:44] and in looking at things being simple
[15:46] and finding simplicity through
[15:48] revelation and and how that uh
[15:50] revelation kind of gives us this wisdom
[15:52] to make sense of complication and chaos.
[15:55] I want to for a few moments deal with
[15:57] what I kind of in my heart in calling
[15:59] the wrong side of simple or the wrong
[16:01] kind of simple. And there's a simple
[16:04] that we find in the scripture that's not
[16:06] referring to a singleness of heart or a
[16:09] a simplicity uh uh towards Christ or a
[16:12] singular faith, but rather it's
[16:14] something that speaks of being naive
[16:16] to be simple. It speaks of a
[16:18] foolishness. And the word that's used in
[16:19] the Old Testament for uh for simple is
[16:22] to be open-minded.
[16:24] And I know that there's a phrase of
[16:26] being open-minded that the world really
[16:28] wants to push on us these days, but the
[16:30] world pushes a dangerous concept of
[16:32] open-mindedness.
[16:34] And so it says, "Well, you should just
[16:35] be open-minded and you should be willing
[16:37] to do this and willing to try that or be
[16:39] open to these other ideas and other
[16:41] thoughts." And and there's a real
[16:43] dangerous open-mindedness that the world
[16:46] lifts up
[16:47] because you you should be open to new
[16:49] experiences and you should be open to
[16:50] new ideas. And this open-mindedness that
[16:53] the world promotes is the simple simple
[16:55] mind that the Bible warns us about.
[16:58] This naeness, this foolishness to be
[17:00] open-minded.
[17:01] And the world will take their idea of
[17:04] open-mindedness as a
[17:08] as an answer to being closed-minded.
[17:10] And the uh and even the dangers of being
[17:13] closed-minded because there's a danger
[17:14] of even a closed mind and how that if
[17:17] you're close-minded and you you develop
[17:19] certain ideas and a very rigid thought
[17:21] process and you begin to have a
[17:23] stereotypes or or prejudices towards
[17:26] other people or you begin to develop
[17:28] hatred or bitterness. And there's a lot
[17:29] of things that could develop from being
[17:31] closed-minded. But the remedy to a
[17:33] closed mind is not the open-mindedness
[17:36] that the world promotes, but rather a
[17:38] true sensitivity and real wisdom.
[17:40] If somebody's closed-minded, if somebody
[17:42] lacks the ability uh uh to to uh think
[17:46] uh sens uh you know, think about other
[17:49] things and think about other people. As
[17:50] Paul is even lifting up this mind of
[17:52] Christ, he says, "Look on the things of
[17:54] others more than you do the things of
[17:56] yourself. Let the mind of Christ be in
[17:58] you." It's really attacking that
[18:00] self-centered, close-minded
[18:02] uh um brutish way of thinking that
[18:05] harms, that offends a and and is kind of
[18:07] that sticky nature that we need to
[18:09] overcome. So, the remedy for being
[18:11] close-minded, the remedy to being a
[18:13] bigot, the remedy to be in something
[18:14] that the world would hate is not to be
[18:17] open-minded and let's just experience
[18:19] things and let's become more liberal in
[18:20] our thought process, but it would be to
[18:22] be truly sensitive and to have real
[18:24] wisdom.
[18:25] And so there's it's not open-mindedness
[18:28] in the scripture is a negative thing
[18:31] that is wanting you to promote this
[18:33] reckless experience, this blind trust
[18:36] because it talks about being naive or
[18:38] foolish. And a lot of the conflict that
[18:40] we experience in relationships and the
[18:43] things that uh maybe cause
[18:45] confrontations or difficulty or strife
[18:47] is not the result of being close-minded,
[18:50] but it's the result of a lack of
[18:51] understanding and sensitivity.
[18:54] So we're talk we're going to be using
[18:55] this ter we're thinking about terms of
[18:57] being sensitive to something and having
[18:59] understanding. Now I know there's a way
[19:01] that the world wants to begin to
[19:02] describe that the world's going to say
[19:04] well we need to be more sensitive. We
[19:05] need more understanding. Those would be
[19:07] better terms than say let's be
[19:08] open-minded because open-minded is
[19:11] inviting experience a and perhaps asking
[19:14] you to compromise when in reality a lot
[19:17] of compromise isn't always compromise
[19:19] isn't always good. There's a lot of
[19:21] things that you can compromise on and
[19:22] think, "Oh, we've achieved agreement.
[19:24] We've achieved satisfaction. We're we're
[19:26] going to go ahead and baptize in the
[19:27] name of the Father and the Son and of
[19:28] Christ.
[19:29] We've compromised. We still have Christ
[19:31] in there. We're going to do both. We're
[19:32] going to baptize in the name of the
[19:33] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost and in the
[19:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Or we're
[19:37] going to sprinkle in the name of the
[19:38] Lord Jesus Christ." We compromised,
[19:40] right? You say, "Well, maybe there's not
[19:42] all compromise is good compromise." I
[19:44] can't remember. Um I think it was uh oh,
[19:47] I'm trying to remember who. I think it
[19:48] might have been um Einstein who said uh
[19:50] there's a such a concept as a rotten
[19:52] compromise to beware of it. There's some
[19:54] compromise that is rotten. It's
[19:55] spoiling. And so there we need to have
[19:58] if there's conflict, if there if there's
[20:00] difficulty, a lot of times it arrives
[20:02] from a lack of understanding or
[20:04] sensitivity really just on one party's
[20:07] part.
[20:09] Because if somebody doesn't understand
[20:10] and somebody's very entrenched in their
[20:12] ideas and somebody's abrasive and
[20:14] somebody's really reluctant to to bend
[20:16] or to yield, if the other party could
[20:19] just understand that person and be more
[20:21] sensitive to that person's ideology or
[20:23] the way they're thinking or the way
[20:25] they're feeling, it can diffuse a lot of
[20:27] things that escalate.
[20:29] And so the I I I just kind of I wanted
[20:31] to sew some of those seeds in there as
[20:33] the Lord is dealing with my heart on a
[20:34] particular subject that I don't want to
[20:36] explore very deeply right now, but I
[20:38] want that to be a part of the Holy
[20:39] Spirit challenging us uh in this how
[20:42] revelation and the mind of Christ is to
[20:44] aid us and to help us. And so the
[20:47] scriptures warn against being
[20:49] simpleminded. And the simple mind is to
[20:51] be naive, to be dull, or I want to use
[20:54] this phrase, to lack discernment,
[20:56] to lack understanding or sensitivity. So
[20:58] when I say be sensitive, it doesn't mean
[21:00] it's easy for you to get your feelings
[21:01] hurt, but you're sensitive to how
[21:03] someone else is feeling. Not because
[21:05] they're crying or because they're
[21:06] telling you how you feel, but you can
[21:07] sense something. When somebody says
[21:10] something, you have this sensitivity be
[21:12] like, "Well, I'm not so sure about
[21:13] that." Or, "Oh, I I see now what what
[21:16] they're saying or where they're coming
[21:17] from." There's a sensitivity and
[21:19] understanding. The Bible says in
[21:21] Proverbs 1:es 22 to 23 and this is
[21:24] wisdom crying in the streets in the
[21:26] first the verses preceding this and this
[21:28] is wisdom's cry. How long ye simple ones
[21:31] will you love simplicity. Now we could
[21:34] be caught off guard that after teaching
[21:36] on a particular belief of your
[21:38] simplicity in Christ and a and the
[21:41] singleness of heart and the singleness
[21:42] of eye if your eye be single and these
[21:45] different things that we could things
[21:46] that you could draw out of the scripture
[21:48] you could say ye simple ones how long
[21:49] will you love simplicity you'd be like
[21:51] forever right because you're thinking
[21:53] this is a good thing well this is the
[21:54] other side of it this is the wrong side
[21:57] of simple it says and the scorners
[21:58] delight in their scorning and fools hate
[22:00] knowledge the naivveness the dullness
[22:03] the open-mindedness. How long are you
[22:05] going to love this mindset? Turn you at
[22:07] my rep pro reproof. Behold, I will pour
[22:10] out my spirit, the spirit of wisdom unto
[22:12] you, and I will make known my words unto
[22:15] you. So, the wrong side of simple lacks
[22:18] knowledge.
[22:20] The wrong side of simple lacks
[22:22] understanding. The understanding of
[22:23] depth, the understanding that things are
[22:25] complex, the understanding of
[22:26] complications. And there's a way that we
[22:29] can want to be simple and we want to
[22:31] have simplicity, but really what we're
[22:33] doing is we're denying understanding.
[22:35] There's a danger in saying, "Well, you
[22:37] know, I I just believe it and that
[22:39] settles it
[22:41] and not but do it as a defense against
[22:44] understanding it." If you don't
[22:46] understand it, that's fine. But God
[22:47] wouldn't want you to say, "I don't have
[22:49] to ever understand it.
[22:50] I don't want to have understanding. I
[22:52] don't want to learn. I don't want to
[22:53] grow. I don't want to I don't want my
[22:55] wisdom uh to increase." And so there's a
[22:57] danger in just saying, "Well, it doesn't
[22:59] really matter and I don't really need to
[23:00] know and I really don't care." And this
[23:02] naivveness, this dullness, this lack of
[23:04] discernment, it's the wrong side of
[23:06] simple that lacks understanding that
[23:08] things are deep, things are
[23:09] multifaceted, things can be complex, and
[23:11] denies even the complication of the
[23:13] world that we're in today. So it says,
[23:15] "Ye simple ones, will you, how long will
[23:17] you love simplicity and scorn and hate
[23:20] knowledge?" And in Proverbs chapter 8:5,
[23:23] it says, 'Oh ye simple, understand
[23:26] wisdom. Oh ye fools, be ye of an
[23:29] understanding heart. If there's an
[23:32] open-mindedness, it's to be open to
[23:34] truth.
[23:35] Be open to correctness. Be willing to
[23:37] say, I'm wrong. Be willing to recognize
[23:39] that you to to the reproof that he even
[23:41] mentions. Turn ye at my reproof. You
[23:43] simple understand wisdom and be ye of an
[23:46] understanding heart. In other words,
[23:49] don't be simple in that you're naive.
[23:51] Don't be simple in that you're dull or
[23:53] foolish or you lack discernment. Don't
[23:54] be susceptible to any influence or whim.
[23:58] But be sensitive to real truth.
[24:01] Be sensitive to genuine correction. Oh,
[24:04] ye simple, you dull, you open-minded,
[24:06] you foolish. And the scripture in the
[24:08] Proverbs is often talking about the
[24:10] simple and how easily they are led
[24:12] astray. And it's remarkable. They're
[24:14] easily led astray, but they're not
[24:15] easily corrected.
[24:18] It's easy to bait them into the that
[24:20] into the house of illreute. It's easy to
[24:22] bait them into sin and entice the sinner
[24:24] and to make them do this and then make
[24:25] them do that. But then when you try to
[24:27] correct them, they don't receive it.
[24:29] It's that dullness. It's that lack of
[24:31] understanding, that lack of knowledge.
[24:33] Proverbs chapter 9:13, it says, "A
[24:35] foolish woman is clamorous. She is
[24:38] simple and knoweth nothing."
[24:42] I appreciate the wisdom of no man
[24:43] amening that too loud.
[24:46] But a foolish woman is clamorous. She is
[24:48] simple and knoweth nothing. The Bible's
[24:50] pointing out that a foolish w woman will
[24:52] often be very loud, be very vocal, get a
[24:54] lot of attention. But saying she is
[24:56] simple, not simple in a positive way.
[24:58] She's simple because she knows nothing.
[25:01] She's simple because she lacks wisdom.
[25:03] She lacks knowledge. She lacks
[25:04] understanding and she's naive. She's
[25:07] dolled. They pray. This type of person,
[25:09] man or woman, prays on the simpleness or
[25:12] the dullness of others for their own
[25:14] advantage and for their own gain.
[25:16] Proverbs 14:15, we're looking at just
[25:18] the wrong side of simple. And this will
[25:20] I think right here when we begin to use
[25:22] this scripture, it's going to start
[25:23] looking at this wisdom that we're
[25:26] wanting to promote this wisdom from
[25:27] above. The simple believeth every word.
[25:31] Now, we could use that phrase in the
[25:33] context that to if we're simple towards
[25:35] Christ, we believe all his word. the
[25:37] simple toward the simplicity that is in
[25:40] Christ is our singleness of faith
[25:42] towards him. We believe what he says. We
[25:44] believe the word of God to be true. But
[25:45] it's talking about someone who has an
[25:47] open mind who's uh naive or foolish.
[25:49] They believe everything they're told.
[25:53] And so they don't have a sensitivity for
[25:55] error. They don't have a sensitivity for
[25:57] something that's not the right course of
[25:59] conduct. They're not aware of danger
[26:01] easily.
[26:02] And and maybe you've noticed this with
[26:04] uh your children as you raised them. Uh
[26:06] in in my family, there was uh one of our
[26:09] my boys just had this sense of if you
[26:11] were in kind of a difficult spot or a
[26:13] dangerous spot, they got uncomfortable.
[26:15] And then another one is kind of like,
[26:16] hey, I don't really sense that the fact
[26:18] that you're setting me up on this mantle
[26:19] right now in front of this fireplace
[26:21] doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. You
[26:22] could leave me here and this would be
[26:24] perfectly normal. But the other one, as
[26:25] soon as you'd start to do like, eh, eh,
[26:27] this doesn't seem right. And it could
[26:29] just even be a sense of this seems
[26:31] dangerous. this isn't normal. And it's
[26:34] it's talking about this a simple person
[26:36] who believes every word and cannot sense
[26:39] right or wrong. And it it joins it to
[26:41] this. But the prudent man lookth well to
[26:44] his going.
[26:46] So it's talking about naivveness. It's
[26:49] talking about a lack of sensitivity to
[26:51] where the fool cannot perceive danger or
[26:53] harm. They believe every word. They
[26:55] think everything's innocent. They're not
[26:56] really concerned about consequence.
[26:58] They're not able to kind of project into
[26:59] the future and see where this path is
[27:01] going to take them or what the what the
[27:03] consequence may be for doing this. They
[27:05] just kind of live in the moment and
[27:06] there's no real thought of is this
[27:08] right? Is this wrong? Is this dangerous?
[27:10] Is this correct? But it says a prudent
[27:12] man, a man who has wisdom is considered
[27:14] and looking to how he's living and how
[27:16] he's acting and where he's going.
[27:19] And it seems to me like this verse,
[27:21] Proverbs 22:3 just spells it out so
[27:24] perfectly. A prudent man, this is a wise
[27:27] man, a discreet, a a man of discretion,
[27:29] a man of discernment. A prudent man
[27:31] foreseeth the evil and hideth himself,
[27:34] but the simple pass on are punished.
[27:38] So when we speak of wisdom, it's the
[27:40] ability to foresee. It's the ability to
[27:42] understand, to appreciate danger, to
[27:45] recognize right or wrong. A prudent man
[27:47] can see that something bad is going to
[27:49] happen. Can see that something of ill
[27:51] effect is coming. And he prepares
[27:53] himself. He hides himself. He doesn't
[27:55] welcome the the danger. It would be in
[27:58] in maybe in this analogy that if you're
[28:00] walking down the road and up ahead you
[28:02] see that there's a giant hole in the
[28:04] ground that a prudent man changes alters
[28:07] his direction to get far enough away
[28:09] from the hole as to not put himself in
[28:11] danger.
[28:12] But it says the the simple just kind of
[28:14] passes on and is like ah look at that
[28:16] hole and gets close enough to it and
[28:18] fiddles around with it to where are kind
[28:20] of just messing with it. They end up in
[28:22] it
[28:23] not appreciating the danger of it, not
[28:25] recognizing, oh, this is a dangerous
[28:26] situation. And and I guess the the web
[28:28] is full of all the viral videos of
[28:30] people not appreciating the danger of
[28:32] the activity.
[28:33] And we've all appreciated the fact that
[28:35] they didn't because we got some some
[28:37] good laughs at it. But it's clear it's
[28:39] like, hey, this uh wait a minute, guy, I
[28:41] wouldn't be so close to that bridge. I
[28:43] wouldn't drive across that. That thing's
[28:44] flooding, right? What are you doing?
[28:47] Right? They just kind of Oh, they don't
[28:48] perceive the danger in it. And so a
[28:51] prudent man sees the evil.
[28:55] He sees that there there's something
[28:57] coming. He's able to use wisdom to say I
[29:00] I prepare for something and and to hide
[29:02] himself to avoid it. But the simple pass
[29:04] on it says and are punished.
[29:07] And this is a principle that revelation,
[29:09] when you have revelation, when you have
[29:11] wisdom and understanding, it equips you
[29:13] and gives you the ability to make
[29:15] decisions, to forecast, to respond to
[29:18] certain things, and to prepare and to
[29:20] make ready.
[29:21] And and it's not just in the context
[29:23] that a prudent man sees the evil and
[29:24] hides himself, but a prudent man sees
[29:26] the good and avails himself to it.
[29:29] So if something negative is going to
[29:30] happen, if you have wisdom, then you can
[29:32] avoid the ca the the ramifications of a
[29:35] negative event. Oh, you shouldn't do
[29:36] that. This is what happens. You prepare
[29:38] yourself. But then wisdom can also
[29:40] apprise you of an opportunity, of a
[29:42] blessing, of something that's right, the
[29:44] right kind of course of conduct, and
[29:46] then you can yield to that and avail
[29:47] yourself to that by wisdom and then
[29:49] benefit from it.
[29:52] Brother Bam says, "Every man that has
[29:53] ever had the spiritual revealed truth of
[29:56] the will of God makes preparation for
[29:58] the fulfilling."
[30:00] So whenever God reveals something to
[30:03] you, it causes you to act through the
[30:06] revelation of the word of God. Anyone
[30:08] who's ever received the revelation of
[30:10] the will of God has made ready for God's
[30:12] will to be fulfilled
[30:14] despite circumstance besid despite
[30:16] symptoms. If if you didn't have a limb
[30:20] and you were missing a limb and God gave
[30:22] you the revelation that that limb was
[30:24] going to grow back, you'd either go buy
[30:25] a shoe or go buy a glove because you
[30:26] knew it was coming.
[30:27] Right.
[30:28] Right. If you were only born with one
[30:30] foot and God gave you a revelation that
[30:32] you're going to grow another one, you
[30:33] wouldn't throw the other one out the
[30:34] next time you bought a pair of shoes.
[30:35] You say, "I need that one."
[30:37] Why? Because you would make ready for
[30:39] the fulfillment. You would be preparing
[30:41] yourself. That's what revelation does.
[30:42] Revelation produces positive action.
[30:46] Positive action. Even if it is, as it
[30:48] says, the prudent foresees evil and
[30:49] hides himself. But revelation produces
[30:52] positive action. It produces
[30:53] responsiveness.
[30:54] Right? It gives us the ability to act be
[30:58] by way of foreseeing things and
[31:00] understanding that something may happen,
[31:02] something may be coming. And let me just
[31:04] sew this seed and hear a little bit and
[31:07] and I'll just join my amen with that.
[31:09] It's chilly in this up here. I don't
[31:11] know how you feel at the back of the
[31:12] house, but the front of the house is
[31:13] chilly tonight. And uh I hope that
[31:16] doesn't put you to sleep. If you fall
[31:17] asleep, I'll take the responsibility for
[31:19] it and I'll wake you up. How's that?
[31:21] I'll just assume I did it. Hey, I'm
[31:23] sorry I put you to sleep. So, I'm just
[31:25] going to wake you up. But this is a this
[31:27] is a concept that's very very important
[31:29] as believers and I think the scripture
[31:31] teaches it teaches it perfectly. There's
[31:33] a difference in responding to something
[31:35] and reacting to something. That's
[31:37] right.
[31:38] And we need to be responsive to things,
[31:40] but our in responding, we want to do it
[31:42] in wisdom instead of just being
[31:43] knee-jerk.
[31:45] Many times when we react to something,
[31:47] we're not acting out of wisdom. It's
[31:48] more knee-jerk. It's more instinct. It's
[31:50] more reflex. But when you respond to
[31:52] something, it's a thoughtful
[31:53] consideration that you thought, well, if
[31:56] I if I act this way because of this
[31:59] action, as we could be say in science,
[32:01] every action produces an equal and
[32:03] opposite reaction. We say, well, this is
[32:05] the force with which I've been met with.
[32:07] If we just react, we can react
[32:09] scientifically and just bring the same
[32:11] intensity back at somebody.
[32:13] Somebody gets in your face and we just
[32:14] get right back in their fa face. But if
[32:17] we pause for a moment and we want to
[32:19] respond to it and we respond instead of
[32:21] react, we can diffuse the situation very
[32:23] quickly.
[32:24] But if we just kind of knee-jerk uh
[32:26] react to it, we can actually escalate it
[32:29] and before you know it, all we're
[32:30] dealing with is the fallout of the
[32:32] confrontation instead of addressing the
[32:34] real issue. And so if you have wisdom,
[32:36] you have the ability to be proactive
[32:38] instead of reactive. That's what godly
[32:41] wisdom will give you the ability to do
[32:42] to be more proactive instead of just
[32:45] reactive in the moment. And what wisdom,
[32:47] proactive wisdom affords you the
[32:49] opportunity is having used wisdom and
[32:51] being proactive. Then when the time
[32:53] comes and you need to be responsive,
[32:55] you're able to do that instead of just
[32:56] be reactive.
[32:58] And again, those are just some seeds I'm
[33:00] wanting to sew about principles that can
[33:02] be very very beneficial to us in our
[33:04] relationships because I'm I'm speaking
[33:06] even about family still. These are
[33:09] things that are excellent for our
[33:10] relationships. So, revelation produces a
[33:13] positive action, not a a knee-jerk
[33:15] reaction in the moment, but something
[33:16] that has responsiveness. There's wisdom
[33:18] attached to it. So, Proverbs is bringing
[33:21] it even to this conclusion. Proverbs
[33:23] 4:7, wisdom is the principal thing.
[33:27] Therefore, get wisdom. It's the
[33:28] principle thing. Therefore, get it. Get
[33:30] wisdom. And with all thy getting, get
[33:33] understanding.
[33:34] So, this is something that God says, if
[33:36] you lack it, ask for it. And if you ask
[33:38] for it, it'll make him happy that you
[33:39] ask and he'll give it to you liberally.
[33:41] Will not chide you for asking it. He
[33:43] will answer. And the Bible says it's the
[33:45] principle thing. What wisdom is the
[33:48] principal thing? Divine wisdom.
[33:51] What is what is it you should get? Not
[33:53] human understanding, not carnal
[33:54] knowledge, not things that relate to the
[33:56] flesh, but get divine wisdom. Wisdom is
[33:58] the principal thing. I I I would even
[34:01] liken it to this that the wisdom that's
[34:03] being lifted up in the scripture is even
[34:06] a natural wisdom that is harnessed by
[34:08] spiritual discernment.
[34:10] That we have a wisdom to even understand
[34:12] human nature. You have a wisdom to
[34:14] understand people and to uh an integrity
[34:16] and a decency of human uh a human
[34:19] integrity and an honesty and just even
[34:20] an uprightness of the of a of a man's
[34:23] mind and the way that he treats people
[34:24] and a wisdom that you can have in
[34:26] business affairs and wisdom you can have
[34:28] in natural things and I'm envious of
[34:30] people who can build stuff
[34:32] and and guy says, "Man, I really I
[34:34] really want to have a fireplace." And
[34:35] they don't go get bids. They just go go
[34:37] to buy and they get all the materials
[34:40] and they get all the tools and they
[34:41] build themselves a fireplace. I I really
[34:43] wanted a shed. Also, who built it for
[34:45] you? Somebody build me something? I just
[34:47] built it. And that what is that? That's
[34:49] a wisdom. That's an ability. That's a
[34:50] skill. And so those things are
[34:53] wonderful. But the wisdom the scriptur
[34:54] is talking about is when we can actually
[34:56] even have a natural wisdom that is
[34:58] harnessed by spiritual discernment.
[35:01] I'm not just wise in business affairs.
[35:03] I'm not just wise in the things of the
[35:04] world. I'm not just in tune with human
[35:06] nature. But there's a spiritual
[35:08] discernment and understanding that comes
[35:09] behind it and harnesses it and can
[35:11] really use it for good.
[35:12] Right?
[35:13] Not mind games and manipulation and not
[35:15] just how to win friends and influence
[35:17] people, but a real spiritual discernment
[35:19] that comes with it to take even natural
[35:21] wisdom and make it beneficial.
[35:25] And and conventional wisdom, as you hear
[35:26] conventional wisdom and things of that
[35:28] nature that speak of of just what
[35:31] prevails conventionally, if it's
[35:33] contrary to Christ, it's a false hope.
[35:35] Amen. even said this is conventional
[35:38] wisdom and this is what this is what man
[35:40] thinks and this is what man does. If
[35:42] it's contrary to Christ, it's a false
[35:43] hope.
[35:44] And that's where we need the spiritual
[35:46] discernment and understanding and
[35:47] knowledge and say this may be the wisdom
[35:49] that prevails and this may be what
[35:51] everyone else would do in this
[35:52] situation, but this is what the word
[35:54] says to do.
[35:55] Amen.
[35:58] And so we need wisdom. We need
[36:00] understanding.
[36:01] We're coming right back to a scripture
[36:03] we used when we began this whole thought
[36:05] of it's complicated. Isaiah 33:6. It
[36:09] says, "And wisdom and knowledge shall be
[36:10] the stability of thy times and strength
[36:13] of salvation. The fear of the Lord is
[36:15] his treasure." I hope it begins just to
[36:18] strike you a little bit differently this
[36:19] evening of just how applicable the
[36:21] scripture is. In the moment that you're
[36:23] living in, wisdom and knowledge is your
[36:25] stability.
[36:27] that if you lack it, that's what reco
[36:28] that's what causes the lack of rest is
[36:30] you don't have the wisdom and
[36:31] understanding. The fact that you don't
[36:33] have knowledge and understanding, the
[36:35] fact that you don't have wisdom of the
[36:36] situation is what makes you uneasy about
[36:38] it. That's just human nature. What's one
[36:40] of the greatest fears? The fears of the
[36:42] unknown,
[36:42] right?
[36:43] The fear of missing out because you
[36:45] think it could be this way. You're
[36:46] afraid it might be that way. But if you
[36:48] have knowledge and wisdom, you have
[36:49] wisdom and knowledge, it can be your
[36:52] strength of salvation. It can be your
[36:54] stability in whatever time you're living
[36:55] in. It's, as I mentioned last time, a
[36:57] contented mind is a continual feast.
[36:59] When your mind's at rest, you can feed
[37:01] on that. You can live on that. You can
[37:03] thrive on that. How are you going to
[37:05] have that? Through wisdom.
[37:07] Wisdom and knowledge is a stability.
[37:08] It's a strength. It's a guiding force.
[37:11] In Proverbs 24:es 3 and 4, scripture
[37:14] after scripture after scripture, we're
[37:17] not only highlighting the negative side
[37:18] of the word simple and to be simple
[37:20] minded, to be naive, to be foolish and
[37:22] open-minded. Now, we're contrasting it
[37:24] with real wisdom.
[37:26] And wisdom is the principal thing. And
[37:27] to get understanding with all you're
[37:29] getting and and now it says through
[37:31] wisdom, I'd love to amplify this more
[37:34] and more through multiple services.
[37:36] Through wisdom is a house builded and by
[37:38] understanding it is established and by
[37:40] knowledge shall all shall the chambers
[37:42] be filled with all precious and pleasant
[37:44] riches. How do you build a house?
[37:47] Through wisdom. How do you make sure
[37:49] it's secure? Through understanding. How
[37:51] do you fill it up? You fill it up with
[37:54] understanding. with knowledge. This is
[37:57] this is a scriptural principle that we
[37:59] can put into application by wisdom is a
[38:02] house built. A built house is a house
[38:04] that is uh um it the house is more than
[38:08] it's not the physical structure that's
[38:10] even being referred to here. But it
[38:11] speaks of a household or a family or
[38:13] even a life. So a house built is a to
[38:16] establish a family to build a household.
[38:18] It's a life. It's a home. It's a family.
[38:21] This is instructive to us whether it be
[38:23] our own lives as single people or lives
[38:25] as as just a a couple or as a family. We
[38:28] don't want to just have houses. We want
[38:30] to have homes because there's a
[38:32] difference.
[38:33] There's a difference between being
[38:34] having a house and having a home. I
[38:36] believe as men we can call ourselves
[38:38] home builders and as women we can be
[38:40] call ourselves homemakers
[38:42] that we want to achieve not just having
[38:43] a dwelling place but having a place of
[38:45] safety and comfort and rest and
[38:47] nourishment spiritually and naturally.
[38:49] And so there's a sense of belonging, a
[38:51] place wherein you know these are
[38:53] treasures that are being developed and
[38:54] cultivated. So a house is established
[38:56] and built and made firm. That speaks of
[38:58] your life. It speaks of a home. It
[39:00] speaks of a family. And so it's it says
[39:03] a house established. That means prepared
[39:05] or arranged to be made firm, stable,
[39:08] secure, something that's ordered. And I
[39:10] speaking of a house filled. So you have
[39:12] a house built, you have a house
[39:14] established, and a house filled to be
[39:16] satisfied, filled, complete. And what
[39:19] does it? Wisdom builds it. Understanding
[39:21] establishes it. And knowledge fills it.
[39:25] This is what builds a family.
[39:27] This is what establishes a life. This is
[39:30] what makes it fulfilling. Wisdom,
[39:33] understanding, and knowledge. I know it
[39:35] may seem a little bit cliche, but this
[39:37] is a reality.
[39:39] If you sense something lacking in your
[39:41] life, Lord, give me wisdom to properly
[39:44] build something. Give me this
[39:45] understanding to properly establish it.
[39:47] and give me knowledge to really make it
[39:49] fruitful and beneficial a and and full
[39:52] and make me feel like I I've achieved
[39:54] something a real genuine success and a
[39:56] spiritual accomplishment. It's by wisdom
[39:58] that's built. It's understanding that
[39:59] establish it and knowledge that fills
[40:01] it. And the words that are used in this
[40:03] proverbs is wisdom is skill or prudent.
[40:06] It means to be wise. Understanding
[40:08] speaks of intelligence and insight.
[40:10] Knowledge directly speaks of discernment
[40:13] and perception.
[40:15] You have to use discretion when filling
[40:18] this house. You want to use discernment.
[40:20] You want to have perception. If we even
[40:22] use the the analogy of what's kind of
[40:24] being pointed to here, that when someone
[40:26] builds a house, you use an architect to
[40:28] design it, an engineer to design it, you
[40:30] use a builder to build it, and then when
[40:31] you go to fill it, you get a home a
[40:33] designer, someone who can fill it up
[40:35] with all precious things and make
[40:36] everything right. And you want someone
[40:38] who has a particular taste and a and can
[40:40] be very sensitive to your style and what
[40:42] you want to do and they know just how to
[40:43] furnish it. So, however you want to
[40:45] think of that process in the natural of
[40:47] an architect, a builder and a and a home
[40:50] decor a person who comes in and can
[40:52] design a home, these are things that
[40:54] spiritually can be effective in your
[40:56] life. Wisdom will build it.
[40:58] Understanding will establish it.
[40:59] Knowledge will fill it.
[41:00] Amen.
[41:02] these very things of uh to use wisdom
[41:05] and knowledge that the wisdom and
[41:07] understanding. You could really say that
[41:09] understanding and wisdom in practice is
[41:11] the knowledge that's being talked about
[41:13] because it's perception. It's
[41:15] discernment. It's understanding and
[41:16] wisdom being used or exercised.
[41:19] And this is what's required for
[41:21] household management.
[41:24] This would be the number one uh
[41:25] requirement for managing a household for
[41:27] building a family. It's the number one
[41:29] uh uh requirement. It's what's required
[41:31] for marriage enrichment.
[41:33] In in two verses, we have a marriage
[41:35] enrichment seminar.
[41:37] And we could humble ourselves to it and
[41:38] say, "Well, if anything's going to be
[41:40] fixed, it's going to be through wisdom,
[41:41] understanding, and knowledge."
[41:43] A and before you make it too generic and
[41:45] too cliche, these things can be so
[41:47] literal and so practical to where if
[41:49] there's a if there's a way that we can
[41:51] begin to understand someone else and
[41:54] have a wisdom about someone else to
[41:56] where it can begin to change the
[41:57] dynamics and how you interact and relate
[41:59] to someone, even if they don't even pick
[42:01] up what's going on, but you do. And
[42:04] think of how beneficial that is even in
[42:06] raising children to be able just to
[42:08] understand where they're coming from
[42:10] to know what they're going through to
[42:12] get a sense of their frustration and how
[42:14] they're perceiving things. And I
[42:15] realized it myself many times when you
[42:17] ask your children to do something or or
[42:19] you you are making a request or you even
[42:22] tell them you need to do this and they
[42:24] and they don't do it and you think well
[42:25] just keep repeating it, right? Just keep
[42:28] repeating to them what you want them to
[42:30] do. But sometimes we need to take a step
[42:31] back and realize, well, that really was
[42:33] an ambiguous request. Please put this
[42:35] over there.
[42:37] You know exactly what this is and you
[42:39] know where over there is. But to
[42:40] somebody else, they might be like, "What
[42:42] are these?
[42:44] Where where's here and where's there?"
[42:46] But we just expect it. We demand it. We
[42:48] get very legalistic about it. When in
[42:49] reality, what we really need is an
[42:51] understanding of what this is and where
[42:53] over there is.
[42:55] And to take time to slow down enough to
[42:56] understand, oh, well, this is what
[42:58] they're seeing. This is how they're
[42:59] interacting. And so it's not really a
[43:01] moment to to uh dispense uh discipline
[43:03] and to spank somebody and ground them
[43:05] and take things away from, but it's a
[43:06] moment for you to change your approach
[43:08] and begin to think, you know what, I
[43:09] need to be more clear. I need to be more
[43:11] patient. I need to explain myself
[43:13] better. Not because they I'm giving in
[43:16] to them and making them the center of
[43:19] the discipline, but rather I'm
[43:20] understanding where they're coming from.
[43:22] Right.
[43:23] Kind of getting a little bit lost in a
[43:24] rabbit trail there, but
[43:27] this is what's required. Wisdom,
[43:30] understanding, and knowledge in
[43:32] relationships. And to build a home, to
[43:34] build a family, to raise children, to
[43:36] have uh to have relationships and
[43:38] marriages that are strengthened, we need
[43:40] wisdom, we need understanding, and we
[43:42] need knowledge.
[43:44] And in first kings chapter 3,
[43:48] God gave Solomon,
[43:50] and this is where we'll just go very
[43:52] quickly through this. God gave Solomon
[43:53] the opportunity to ask for anything.
[43:56] Verse five, he comes to him in a dream,
[43:58] says, "What do you want?" And in verses
[44:00] seven and 8, he acknowledges just how
[44:02] vast and great the kingdom is. This is
[44:04] your people. It's a great people. It's a
[44:06] wonderful people. And you've given me
[44:08] responsibility over them. And he's
[44:10] saying, "This is a vast kingdom. This is
[44:12] a precious people. These are your
[44:14] chosen. These are the greatest people on
[44:16] all the earth. And you've made me the
[44:19] leader and ruler over him and over them.
[44:22] And he says, "I am but a little child.
[44:26] I know not how to go out or come in."
[44:29] Solomon is saying, "I don't have the
[44:30] wisdom to rule these people correctly. I
[44:33] I I don't have the knowledge that these
[44:35] people require. I don't have the wisdom
[44:37] that these people need. I don't have the
[44:39] understanding of your people to be a
[44:41] good king. He's actually recognizing
[44:43] either deficiencies in his heart and
[44:46] things that lacked in his own heart and
[44:48] lacked in his own experience and say,
[44:49] "Lord, if I'm ever going to be a king
[44:51] worthy of this throne, I need the
[44:53] ability to govern properly."
[44:56] And we could feel that way about our
[44:58] marriages, about our responsibility in
[45:00] raising children, about the
[45:01] relationships we have with people. We
[45:02] can just be honest with ourselves. This
[45:04] is an awesome responsibility. And some
[45:06] of us have probably said even very
[45:08] recently, "I don't know if I'm up to the
[45:09] task. I feel like a failure. I don't
[45:11] know if I'm really called to this." Get
[45:13] those thoughts out of your mind. You've
[45:15] got this.
[45:17] God did not put you in that relationship
[45:18] because you're going to be a failure in
[45:20] that relationship. He did not give you
[45:21] children because you're not able to
[45:23] raise them. He trusts you.
[45:25] He's going to equip you. He's going to
[45:26] give you the things that you need. So,
[45:27] we do not despair. We do not get
[45:29] frustrated. We do not abandon our
[45:31] calling and and give over to this
[45:33] hopelessness. But we can't acknowledge,
[45:34] Lord, this is a great task. I don't feel
[45:38] up to it. Says, I'm but a little child.
[45:40] I don't have the wisdom. I don't have
[45:41] the discernment. I don't know how to go
[45:42] out or to come in. I don't know how to
[45:44] judge correctly. I don't know if this is
[45:45] the right thing, if that's the right
[45:47] thing to do. So, he asked in verse 9,
[45:49] give therefore thy servant an
[45:51] understanding heart to judge thy people,
[45:53] that I may discern between good and bad.
[45:56] For who is able to judge this thy so
[45:58] great a people? These people are worthy
[46:01] of the best. These people are worthy of
[46:02] righteousness. They're worth worthy of
[46:04] justice. So Lord, give me an
[46:06] understanding heart to judge thy people
[46:09] that I may discern between good and bad.
[46:12] It wasn't, Lord, make me right on
[46:14] everything. Make everybody believe what
[46:15] I say and let everybody do what I ask
[46:17] them to do. And Lord, just when I tell
[46:19] them to do something, may they do it.
[46:21] Lord, give me the respect of the people
[46:23] so that what I says goes. He didn't
[46:25] create this benevolent dictatorship. He
[46:27] didn't create this authoritarian figure
[46:29] that everyone would just do it. says,
[46:31] "Give me an understanding heart to do
[46:32] justice for your people."
[46:34] What did he become? He did not become
[46:36] egotistical about his role. He realized
[46:37] as a king, I'm a servant.
[46:39] Right?
[46:40] Therefore, your people deserve justice.
[46:42] Your people deserve to be treated
[46:43] fairly, and they deserve equity. So,
[46:45] give me an understanding heart to know
[46:47] your people to be sensitive to what they
[46:49] need. And therefore, I can judge them
[46:51] correctly. I can discern between good
[46:53] and ga bad because Lord, who who can
[46:55] rightly dispense justice to a great
[46:57] people as precious and noble as these.
[47:01] And as you continue to read, you see
[47:02] that Solomon, as God refers to it, he
[47:05] asked for understanding to discern
[47:07] judgment. This is what he wanted.
[47:09] Understanding to discern justice and
[47:10] what is right. He asks for knowledge to
[47:13] know the right thing to do. Isn't that a
[47:16] phrase that can pretty much sum up all
[47:18] of our conundrums? What's the right
[47:20] thing to do? Should I buy a Ford or a
[47:22] Chevy? Should I drink Pepsi or Coke?
[47:25] Right? Which diet should I go on? You
[47:27] You're asking yourself over and over and
[47:28] over again, what's the right thing to
[47:30] do? Which way should I go? And the Bible
[47:33] says that God gave him already in this
[47:35] dream. He's saying, I've given you, it's
[47:37] been given to you. I gave him a wise and
[47:39] understanding heart. This is what he was
[47:42] given, a wise and understand heart to
[47:43] faithfully fulfill his responsibility.
[47:47] And this is what we need to ask for.
[47:49] It's that simple. We can ask for this
[47:51] this spiritual insight, this God godly
[47:54] intuition, this discernment. Lord, give
[47:56] me wisdom. Give me discernment. Not as
[47:58] the king of Israel, but in whatever
[48:00] calling you're in.
[48:01] We don't have to judge a so great a
[48:03] people. But if you're a housewife, ask
[48:05] for this godly intuition. Ask for
[48:07] spiritual insight. Ask for this divine
[48:09] wisdom, knowledge, and understanding in
[48:11] whatever role you're in. You can ask for
[48:12] it as children.
[48:14] You can ask for it as a spouse. You can
[48:16] ask for it in whatever capacity you're
[48:18] in. God, give me wisdom. Give me
[48:20] spiritual insight. Lord, help me to be
[48:22] sensitive to what's taking place. I
[48:24] don't want to be clueless.
[48:26] Have you ever had the family member,
[48:28] they're not mean, they're just clueless,
[48:31] right? And you have to say, now look, I
[48:34] know it comes off as real selfish and
[48:35] real rude. They just don't realize
[48:36] there's other people. They're more
[48:38] clueless to how their behavior comes
[48:40] off. They're more clueless to, you know,
[48:41] let others go first and maybe that's not
[48:43] the right thing to do and that's really
[48:45] abrasive and wa that was really that was
[48:47] really rude. But it's just they're
[48:48] they're just not sensitive at all
[48:52] and they lack that and we should be
[48:53] asking God for that. And it's more
[48:56] necessary and ever because of the unique
[48:58] challenges we're facing more necessary
[49:01] than ever in the age that we're living
[49:03] in to have godly discernment, to have
[49:05] godly wisdom, to have a godly instinct
[49:06] and intuition.
[49:09] not learning and and and if it if the
[49:12] Rubik's cube analogy is misleading,
[49:14] listen, you're not going to memorize a
[49:16] bunch of algorithms to figure this one
[49:17] out.
[49:18] So only uses analogy to say that in
[49:20] order to solve them and to solve them
[49:22] efficiently, you learn, you recognize
[49:24] patterns and you implement the algorithm
[49:26] that is can address this pattern.
[49:27] There's certain moves you can do in
[49:29] repetition and it'll resolve the Rubik's
[49:31] cube. Well, in the Rubik's cube that is
[49:32] Le Oysia, you need godly wisdom.
[49:35] You you need a an algorithm that God is
[49:38] running. You need a spiritual intuition.
[49:39] You need a discernment to where this is
[49:41] God acting. It's an instinct on the
[49:43] inside. It comes from having the mind of
[49:44] Christ, not a a memorized list.
[49:48] You're not going to be Patrick Mahomes
[49:49] who looks at his wrist and says, "Okay,
[49:50] this is the play. That's the play. Okay,
[49:52] this is what we're going to do." And you
[49:53] have somebody telling you in your ear
[49:55] and and and figuring out because you've
[49:56] learned something, but rather you need
[49:58] the teacher on the inside. You need
[50:00] something giving you the wisdom,
[50:02] something giving you the insight.
[50:03] There's certainly an analogy to the
[50:05] instincts that these people have and
[50:06] their certain disciplines and the skill
[50:08] set that they use. Well, in whatever
[50:10] sense that they would point to it, you
[50:11] have it in the greatest and most
[50:13] wonderful sense that you can have the
[50:15] inside teacher telling you this is what
[50:17] you need to do. That's what you need to
[50:18] do. This is what's happening. This is
[50:20] what's not happening.
[50:23] We need it more than ever. This godly
[50:24] wisdom, this wisdom from above to handle
[50:26] the pressures of the age. Now, in the
[50:29] time that we have left this evening, and
[50:30] I'm running out of time, and so I'm
[50:33] definitely going to skip a few things
[50:35] and and come to
[50:38] um
[50:41] in and coming to a close,
[50:45] there's a phenomena called normal
[50:47] accidents. Any of heard of those? You
[50:50] might think, "Yeah, that's my life,
[50:51] brother Aaron. I'm just a regular
[50:53] everyday normal accident."
[50:56] But normal accidents are described this
[50:58] way. Modern systems are so complex that
[51:00] it's almost inevitable that some
[51:02] combination of minor failures will
[51:04] eventually amount to something
[51:06] catastrophic. So in one sense it might
[51:08] be kind of resigning to the fact that
[51:10] things are so complicated things or
[51:12] things are so complex that there's so
[51:14] many parts relying upon other parts that
[51:16] it's just inevitable for something to
[51:18] fail and there to be a catastrophe. And
[51:21] you just begin to think about even if uh
[51:23] if there was a Texan who's thinking
[51:25] about the power system and saying well
[51:27] how did we get to the place where all of
[51:28] us are without power we don't have water
[51:30] we don't have internet and the whole
[51:31] system crumbles and you realize that
[51:33] it's we rely upon so many different
[51:36] things and these things can be so
[51:38] complex modern systems are so complex
[51:40] that they say it's just inevitable that
[51:42] some combination of notice this minor
[51:45] failures nothing really big will result
[51:48] in something catastrophic.
[51:50] So, it's an accident or a mistake that
[51:52] results from just minor oversightes.
[51:54] Nothing really big, nothing really
[51:56] major. Not like somebody accidentally
[51:57] pushing the nuke button and and the, you
[52:00] know, atomic bomb blows up in Moscow.
[52:02] It's just something small here.
[52:04] Something small there. Just little
[52:05] things that build up and result in a
[52:08] catastrophe. And it doesn't even have to
[52:09] be gross negligence like, well, that was
[52:11] reckless behavior. You should have never
[52:13] done this. You should have never done
[52:14] that. But just small little decisions
[52:16] here and there. And the person that
[52:18] initiated or that came up with this
[52:20] theory and and wrote a book on it, at
[52:23] least it was a published study many many
[52:24] years ago. There was several different
[52:26] examples that he used of normal
[52:28] accidents. And a couple that seem very
[52:30] substantial that we might recall is one
[52:32] uh I I say might recall. I wouldn't
[52:35] expect very many to even remember a lot
[52:36] of these but or the two I'm going to use
[52:39] but three-mile island the catastrophe
[52:41] that happened at three-mile island it's
[52:43] the most significant nuclear accident or
[52:45] nuclear emergency in American history
[52:47] they say there were 30 just 30 minutes
[52:49] away from a significant major
[52:51] catastrophic nuclear meltdown one that
[52:54] would be on par uh to Chernobyl that you
[52:58] have this 30 minutes away at three-mile
[53:00] island and just and the effect and
[53:02] ramifications it could have had it took
[53:04] 14 years to clean it up at over $14
[53:06] billion cost. So this was a very
[53:09] terrible, terrible accident. And this is
[53:11] how it was summarized. A major accident
[53:14] caused by five discreet events.
[53:18] There is no way the engineers in the
[53:20] control room could have ever known about
[53:22] any of them. No glaring errors or
[53:25] spectacularly bad decisions were made
[53:27] that exasperated those events. And all
[53:29] the malfunctions were in themselves so
[53:32] trivial that individually they would
[53:34] have created no more than a nuisance.
[53:37] What caused the accident was the way
[53:39] minor events unexpectedly interacted to
[53:42] create a major problem.
[53:44] Now, this might this might be very
[53:46] discouraging to think that, brother
[53:48] Aaron, are there many discreet events
[53:50] happening in my life that in themselves
[53:52] are they're just trivial and they're
[53:54] small malfunctions that nobody would be
[53:56] expected to catch, but they're
[53:57] eventually going to collide in such a
[53:59] way to where it's going to create a
[54:00] major problem.
[54:03] Yeah.
[54:05] Yeah. That's kind of what I'm implying.
[54:09] It's kind of scary, isn't it? Let me use
[54:11] another one just to make you a little
[54:12] bit more happy tonight. In the the
[54:15] Challenger explosion when the space
[54:16] shuttle exploded in 1986, and I know
[54:18] that we all remember that
[54:21] says, "No fundamental decision was made
[54:23] by NASA to do evil.
[54:25] Rather, a series of seemingly harmless
[54:28] decisions were made that incrementally
[54:30] moved the space agency toward a
[54:33] catastrophic outcome."
[54:35] You start going back through the the
[54:37] wreckage. You start going back through
[54:39] the decisions. You start examining
[54:40] everything very closely. What went
[54:42] wrong? What went wrong? You begin to see
[54:43] well that was seemed really innocuous at
[54:45] the time and that didn't really seem to
[54:47] matter and this decision is really not
[54:49] that glaring of a thing. But just over
[54:51] time it was no conscious decision to say
[54:54] you know what let's just keep our
[54:55] fingers crossed and see if it makes it
[54:58] and like well I guess that didn't work.
[55:00] No, they they thought everything they
[55:02] were doing they thought they were
[55:03] prudent. They thought they were wires
[55:04] about it. So there was no decision to do
[55:06] something that would result in a
[55:07] catastrophe. But all these seemingly
[55:09] harmless decisions built and
[55:11] incrementally added up to where it
[55:13] resulted in an explosion of a space
[55:14] shuttle and the loss of life. And
[55:16] they're saying the same thing with
[55:17] Three-Mile Island. You actually had a
[55:19] scenario where all the engineers in the
[55:21] room, none of them would be expected to
[55:22] say, "Hey, you see that happening?
[55:23] That's that's a disa recipe for
[55:25] disaster." Especially if this is
[55:26] happening and especially if that's
[55:28] happening. And someone be able to say,
[55:29] "Hey, whoa, wait a minute. I'm getting
[55:31] the sense that this reading is really
[55:33] not good with this reading. If these
[55:35] things are happening, something's out of
[55:36] control. Something's not right." And
[55:37] you'll find that in a lot of different
[55:39] situations, whether it be air traffic
[55:40] disasters or uh other complex systems
[55:43] where there's been a failure, it's not
[55:45] necessarily one big huge thing that was
[55:47] done, but it's these small little
[55:49] things,
[55:49] right?
[55:51] And processes that are in place that
[55:52] inhibit people to make the right
[55:54] decisions.
[55:56] And our lives can be just like this
[55:59] where we could say, well, the little
[56:00] spoes spoil the vine and all these
[56:02] different things. It could be all these
[56:04] just little things that begin to add up
[56:05] and it builds and builds and builds to
[56:07] where there's a there's a meltdown.
[56:08] There's something significant that
[56:09] happens and you take a step back and
[56:10] say, "Well, I didn't do this and I
[56:12] didn't do that and I didn't do this and
[56:13] I was doing this and I was doing that."
[56:15] But there was just little things maybe
[56:16] you're missing along the way.
[56:18] And so I don't share this with you to
[56:20] create fear.
[56:22] I'm not sharing these things with you to
[56:24] cause you to be fearful of any
[56:27] particular outcome, but to encourage you
[56:29] to seek godly wisdom above all,
[56:32] to ask God for wisdom,
[56:34] because he can give you the kind of
[56:36] intuition to where you can sense
[56:39] something's not right.
[56:41] He can give you the kind of wisdom to
[56:42] say, you know what, I don't think that's
[56:44] the right decision. And instead of us
[56:47] working from behind where we're always
[56:49] looking back and saying,"Well, shouldn't
[56:50] have done this. Shouldn't have done
[56:51] that." We can actually begin to look
[56:52] back and say, "I'm so glad that I had
[56:55] the wisdom at the time to do this. I'm
[56:57] so glad I had the wisdom at the time to
[57:00] do that." And maybe even some of you
[57:01] here tonight could pause just for a
[57:02] moment. Don't get lost in this thought
[57:04] and go back and say, "You know what? I
[57:06] was just doing what I thought was best
[57:07] at the time, but I realized now what I
[57:09] thought was the leading of the Lord was
[57:11] his mercy and his grace and was godly
[57:14] wisdom." Yes, sir.
[57:15] Had I stayed in that situation and I
[57:17] just felt this was the better thing to
[57:18] do. Had I subjected myself to that, this
[57:21] would have happened, that would have
[57:21] happened. And do you realize and look
[57:23] back that was the wisdom of God?
[57:25] And maybe we could look back and say
[57:27] there was times when we felt that God
[57:29] was dealing with our hearts to make a
[57:30] decision to do something and or to
[57:32] achieve something, whatever the language
[57:34] you might want to use to describe the
[57:36] scenario to where you feel that God is
[57:38] impressing upon you what is wisdom and
[57:40] you refuse that and you go forward in
[57:42] it. you realize, hey, I made a little
[57:43] bit of a mess of something.
[57:46] And my point is this, just by using this
[57:48] reference to normal accidents, and I'm
[57:50] I'm think I'm starting to get frostbite,
[57:51] so I'm going to close here real soon. I
[57:54] hope we're not paying the electric bill.
[57:56] My goodness, we take up another
[57:58] offering.
[58:00] Um, I know that was no, by no means am I
[58:02] asking for the heat to be turned on. So,
[58:04] I start sweating and I really feel like
[58:05] I'm preaching then. But my point is this
[58:08] by raising the issue of normal accidents
[58:10] is to get us to realize life is so
[58:12] complex anymore
[58:14] that just an oversight here and an
[58:16] oversight there and forgetting to do
[58:18] this and forgetting to do that. We're
[58:19] all feeling a little bit overwhelmed
[58:21] with world the world these days. I mean
[58:23] we there was a time you just you know
[58:25] you got in the car and you drove
[58:27] somewhere and we get you get the other
[58:29] side of town and you finally are doing
[58:30] your grocery run because you only do
[58:32] this and you got to drive 45 minutes.
[58:33] You got to fight traffic and you finally
[58:35] make it to Trader Joe's and you get out
[58:36] and you're like, I forgot my mask
[58:39] and you're asking people in the parking
[58:41] lot, do they give mask? Do they have
[58:42] mask in there? And you're wondering, did
[58:43] my will my shirt work? And you're trying
[58:45] to figure all sort you're rumaging
[58:47] through your car. Why? Because now you
[58:48] got to worry about a mask,
[58:49] right?
[58:50] And we're doing good just to make sure
[58:51] we have our wallets with us. And things
[58:54] just build and they build and they build
[58:55] and oh, I forgot about this. I forgot
[58:57] about that. It would be normal to have
[59:00] an accident. Right?
[59:01] Be normal to make a mistake. I express
[59:04] it in the way to where may we have grace
[59:06] for everyone else in this room to
[59:08] realize we're under enough pressure in
[59:11] this day and age to where we're prone to
[59:12] make a mistake.
[59:15] There's enough pressure to where we
[59:16] might not say the right thing to someone
[59:18] in a particular situation. We might tell
[59:20] a joke that may may offend somebody
[59:22] because we're not sensitive. We might
[59:24] make a comment. We might do something.
[59:25] We might say there's so many different
[59:27] scenarios we're all facing. Can we just
[59:28] look at one another and say, "You know
[59:29] what? I'm gonna have a little bit more
[59:31] grace and patience for my brother and
[59:32] for my sister. Realizing we're all under
[59:34] a lot of pressure and we'll say and do
[59:36] things sometimes that aren't normal and
[59:38] that will cause offense and that'll be
[59:40] an accident.
[59:41] Yes, sir.
[59:42] Let's not all use it as an excuse. Oops.
[59:43] Did I say that? That was an accident.
[59:48] That was that a normal accident? I'm so
[59:50] sorry.
[59:51] But we can have a little bit of grace to
[59:53] realize, hey, there's things that take
[59:54] place. There's things that transpire.
[59:55] There's things that's building. There's
[59:56] a pressure that's put on us. And so yes,
[59:59] I want to minister grace to the here
[1:00:01] today to we're acknowledging life is
[1:00:03] kings. There's pressure, pressure,
[1:00:05] pressure, pressure, but there's so many
[1:00:06] voices in the world. Do this, do that.
[1:00:08] So many things taking place that if we
[1:00:10] make mistakes, listen, God understands
[1:00:11] and he knows.
[1:00:13] He's not going to be to the hear by
[1:00:15] expressing that. But I also want to
[1:00:16] point out that we could we need to in
[1:00:18] times that we're living in ask for
[1:00:20] wisdom that is from above.
[1:00:23] I don't have time to go through it and
[1:00:25] I'm just going to skip it. But in James
[1:00:26] 3 13 to18, it speaks about a wisdom
[1:00:30] which is from above.
[1:00:33] A wisdom that is from above. This is
[1:00:35] what we want to have.
[1:00:37] We want to have a wisdom that is from
[1:00:38] above. We're making decisions every day
[1:00:41] in a world that's built by deception and
[1:00:43] driven by lust. It's the kind of world
[1:00:45] we're living in. So to make it in a
[1:00:47] world today, we need a wisdom that comes
[1:00:49] from above. Not the wisdom from beneath,
[1:00:51] the wisdom from below that is earthly,
[1:00:53] sensual, and devilish. But we need a
[1:00:54] wisdom from above. If you want to take
[1:00:56] time to res to read this scripture later
[1:00:59] in James 3 13-18 and consider family
[1:01:03] relationships, consider what's the
[1:01:04] secret to success. And you'll find it's
[1:01:06] wisdom, not force.
[1:01:09] It's wisdom. It's wisdom from above
[1:01:11] that's going to achieve the result that
[1:01:12] you want to have in your home. Not a
[1:01:15] more strict, rigid form of discipline,
[1:01:19] but understanding.
[1:01:20] Amen. grace, patience, knowledge, and
[1:01:24] wisdom.
[1:01:26] And if you ponder that, we're making
[1:01:27] decisions every day and this world
[1:01:30] that's chaotic, that's complex, a world
[1:01:33] that's driven by lust
[1:01:36] in first kings 3 16 to 27 as we read it
[1:01:40] in the beginning. I'm glad we read it in
[1:01:41] the beginning.
[1:01:45] soon after is the the next story after
[1:01:48] Solomon has asked for wisdom and God
[1:01:49] says I've given it to you. The story
[1:01:51] we're presented with and we're all very
[1:01:53] familiar with it is Solomon has to judge
[1:01:56] between two harlots who are claiming
[1:01:58] that a living child is theirs.
[1:02:01] And what we read about is Solomon's
[1:02:04] wisdom and judgment.
[1:02:06] We read about his response to a
[1:02:08] situation that was very very difficult.
[1:02:10] And it's a it's a she said she said. One
[1:02:14] claims the baby, the other claims the
[1:02:16] baby. And he realizes this is a
[1:02:18] difficult proposition. They're both
[1:02:20] harlots.
[1:02:23] One says it's her baby, the other says
[1:02:24] it's her baby. And this is the it just
[1:02:28] tells a story of a wisdom where in God's
[1:02:30] God had granted him wisdom to be able to
[1:02:32] judge this case correctly. And Solomon's
[1:02:35] wisdom was to say, "This is very hard.
[1:02:37] This is very difficult. Why don't you
[1:02:39] just bring me a sword
[1:02:41] and I'll divide the baby in half? Now,
[1:02:44] since we know the story, we we realize
[1:02:46] that was tremendous. That was great
[1:02:47] wisdom. And it was wisdom in the moment.
[1:02:51] It might not work now.
[1:02:53] Right?
[1:02:54] If someone comes and says, "Well, this
[1:02:55] was my toy. I had it first. Bring me a
[1:02:57] knife. We'll go ahead and cut it in
[1:02:59] half." And our kids are smart enough to
[1:03:00] say, "Well, don't do that. He can have
[1:03:02] it. You're going to let me have it."
[1:03:04] Right? You gonna let me have it.
[1:03:07] But at the time in the moment with the
[1:03:09] characters that he was facing, he had an
[1:03:11] understanding of human nature. He had an
[1:03:13] understanding of the instincts of a
[1:03:14] mother. In that moment, this was wisdom
[1:03:16] on display.
[1:03:18] So, we'll go ahead and take the baby and
[1:03:20] we'll see which one the baby responds to
[1:03:22] and we'll do all these empirical tests
[1:03:23] and we'll do this and we'll do that. He
[1:03:25] didn't have the ability to conduct a DNA
[1:03:26] test.
[1:03:28] That might be prudent in this day and
[1:03:29] age. will take the baby, put it with the
[1:03:30] foster family, have someone else care
[1:03:32] for it while we determine what the uh
[1:03:34] the maternity is is of this child. But
[1:03:36] in the moment, in the time that a
[1:03:38] decision to be made, he asked God to
[1:03:40] give him an understanding to discern
[1:03:42] judgment, to be able to understand
[1:03:44] people correctly and give them justice.
[1:03:46] And here he was faced in a situation
[1:03:48] where he did not want to crush a
[1:03:50] mother's heart.
[1:03:52] So having wisdom of how a mother would
[1:03:54] feel, he says, "Bring me a sword."
[1:03:56] And Solomon's wisdom in judgment was if
[1:03:59] we divide the baby in half, you both
[1:04:00] will get equal parts. And it brought out
[1:04:03] the mother and the real mother. And she
[1:04:05] said, 'W wait a minute. You know what?
[1:04:07] She can have the baby. And it brought
[1:04:10] out that evilness in the other one to
[1:04:12] say, "Fine, cut it in half. If we if we
[1:04:14] both can't, if only one of us can have
[1:04:16] it, then neither of us should have it."
[1:04:18] And immediately Solomon could discern
[1:04:20] and knew which one was the right one,
[1:04:22] which one was the mother. Now, we can't
[1:04:25] take the very exact uh circumstances of
[1:04:29] this story and just have that kind of
[1:04:32] request that we can in every situation.
[1:04:34] Okay, bring me a sword. And that's the
[1:04:36] way we solve things in our houses. I
[1:04:37] went out and got a really nice chainsaw
[1:04:39] and it's like all the Playmobil's cut in
[1:04:41] half, the beds cut in half, you know,
[1:04:43] everything's in half. It's like, well,
[1:04:45] you wanted it this way. This is the way
[1:04:46] we resolve arguments around here.
[1:04:50] But I want you to think about the
[1:04:52] dynamics that we can take from it and
[1:04:54] take a principle from it. And this needs
[1:04:57] to be our response in every situation.
[1:05:00] Bring me a sword.
[1:05:03] But not just a sword. Bring me the
[1:05:05] sword.
[1:05:07] In every situation, Lord, bring me the
[1:05:10] sword.
[1:05:11] Amen.
[1:05:11] That's what I need. I need the word that
[1:05:13] can rightly discern this situation. I
[1:05:15] need a discerning word. I need wisdom.
[1:05:17] Whenever you're faced with a situation
[1:05:18] with children, in a relationship, in a
[1:05:20] business, in a job, in the markets,
[1:05:22] whatever it might be, Lord, bring me a
[1:05:24] sword so I can rightly divide this
[1:05:27] situation. I can know the right thing to
[1:05:28] do. Lord, bring me discernment so I can
[1:05:30] sense what this other person's going
[1:05:32] through. Bring me discernment so I can
[1:05:34] understand better even what I'm dealing
[1:05:35] with. That can be our response as
[1:05:37] believers in every situation we're going
[1:05:39] through. Say, Lord, bring me the sword.
[1:05:41] Amen.
[1:05:43] That's the kind of response we can have.
[1:05:45] And just as we catch the visual of
[1:05:47] brother Brandham being out in the desert
[1:05:48] and lifting his hands up and a sword
[1:05:50] coming into his hand, a sword from
[1:05:52] above, I believe that we as God's
[1:05:54] children can lift our hands and say,
[1:05:56] "Lord, bring me the sword." And he can
[1:05:58] give you the king sword
[1:06:00] and can give you godly wisdom to face
[1:06:03] the challenges that all of us are going
[1:06:04] through that none of us are exempt from.
[1:06:08] If anybody here is exempt from
[1:06:10] challenges, I would love to take you to
[1:06:11] lunch tomorrow on me wherever you want
[1:06:14] to go.
[1:06:15] and I want to hear about your
[1:06:16] non-challenged life. And some of you
[1:06:19] saying, "Well, why don't you take us who
[1:06:20] are being challenged out for a free
[1:06:22] lunch?"
[1:06:23] Right? Because we would all get free
[1:06:25] lunch tomorrow. Should we just come here
[1:06:27] and cater in because we're all going
[1:06:29] through something.
[1:06:31] But those things are opportunities for
[1:06:33] victory.
[1:06:34] It's a guarantee of victory. So God
[1:06:37] God's word to you today is I understand.
[1:06:40] God tell he's telling you right now, I
[1:06:42] know what you're going through. I
[1:06:43] understand. But he also wants you to
[1:06:44] know I've given you something
[1:06:46] for what you're going through.
[1:06:48] It's wisdom and we can ask for it.
[1:06:51] So listen, give me a sword.
[1:06:53] We'll we'll pick up on some of these
[1:06:55] things later. Had a lot of really neat
[1:06:56] things to share with you. We'll have to
[1:06:57] share it some other time. If not in a
[1:07:00] church service, we'll do it in the in
[1:07:01] the millennium
[1:07:02] and I can take my my time. Some of you
[1:07:04] are thinking, "Yeah, a thousand years is
[1:07:06] about what it takes for you, brother
[1:07:07] Aaron." But I I would look forward to
[1:07:09] it. There's so many rich things in his
[1:07:10] word. Let's stand together as a
[1:07:12] congregation tonight. Thank you for your
[1:07:15] attentiveness, your pull on the word of
[1:07:17] God. This is what we can say as we go
[1:07:21] forward into the week. Bring me a sword.
[1:07:26] Whatever I'm going through, Lord, give
[1:07:27] me wisdom that is from above. James says
[1:07:30] it's first pure, then peaceable,
[1:07:34] gentle, easy to be entreated, full of
[1:07:37] mercy and good fruits, without
[1:07:38] partiality and without hypocrisy.
[1:07:42] That's what real wisdom is. If you could
[1:07:45] take these characteristics that the
[1:07:48] wisdom that is from above is pure,
[1:07:50] peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated,
[1:07:52] full of mercy and good fruits, without
[1:07:54] partiality,
[1:07:56] without hypocrisy. You have something by
[1:07:58] which you can measure what's motivating
[1:08:01] you to do something. What's motivating
[1:08:03] you to say something? What's motivating
[1:08:06] you to react to something? You say,
[1:08:07] "Well, is this pure? Is this peaceable?
[1:08:10] What will this produce?" Does the Bible
[1:08:12] not teach us that a soft answer turneth
[1:08:14] away wrath?
[1:08:15] But what does the foolish person do?
[1:08:17] Just spews off at the mouth and makes it
[1:08:18] worse. But a soft answer turneth away
[1:08:21] wrath.
[1:08:23] that that doesn't mean to speak in a
[1:08:26] quiet tone, but it's something that's
[1:08:28] sensitive to the situation.
[1:08:30] And it can take something that's very
[1:08:32] agitated, something very frustrated,
[1:08:34] something boiling, something that's just
[1:08:35] right, coming to a place where it's
[1:08:37] going to blow up. It's going to be a
[1:08:38] Chernobyl. It's going to be a three-
[1:08:39] mile island. But all of a sudden, you
[1:08:40] have the kind of wisdom to say, "Hold
[1:08:42] on. I recognize what's happening here.
[1:08:45] These gauges are moving, and I know now
[1:08:48] I can approach this differently to avoid
[1:08:50] a catastrophe, to avoid a meltdown.
[1:08:54] Lord, bring us a sword. Let's bow our
[1:08:56] heads in a word of prayer.
[1:09:00] Let that be your prayer tonight. Lord,
[1:09:03] give me this word, a discerning word, a
[1:09:06] spirit of wisdom and understanding
[1:09:10] that I might
[1:09:13] not use it. With your heads bowed, I I
[1:09:16] want to say this. It's not a sword so
[1:09:19] that you can leave someone bleeding.
[1:09:21] It's not a sword so you can attack
[1:09:23] somebody. It's not a sword so you can
[1:09:24] put your kids in their place. But a
[1:09:27] sword that can find right and divide it
[1:09:31] from wrong. A sword that's discerning. A
[1:09:35] sword that's understanding.
[1:09:37] A sword that's very precise and
[1:09:39] sensitive.
[1:09:41] Not a blunt instrument to cause damage,
[1:09:43] but a surgical instrument. Yes.
[1:09:45] To bring healing. Something very
[1:09:47] precise.
[1:09:49] something very direct.
[1:09:51] We want to know how to handle this
[1:09:53] sword,
[1:09:54] to use it for your glory, to promote
[1:09:56] healing, to rightly divide between right
[1:09:58] and wrong, that it could promote
[1:10:02] the right things. If that's your desire,
[1:10:04] you want to lift your hand. Maybe that
[1:10:06] hand, let it raise your dominant hand if
[1:10:08] you're right-handed. If you're
[1:10:08] left-handed, I'm just going to raise
[1:10:11] both because I'm ambidextrous and say,
[1:10:12] "Lord, give me a sword.
[1:10:16] Give me the word, Lord.
[1:10:20] Let me have this mind of Christ.
[1:10:24] I lift my hands to you. Let's pray. Our
[1:10:26] gracious heavenly father,
[1:10:28] Lord, you told to Solomon in a dream,
[1:10:31] what do you want?
[1:10:33] And he considered his calling and said,
[1:10:35] Lord, considering my calling and the
[1:10:38] legacy I've been left and the
[1:10:39] responsibility I have to your people, I
[1:10:42] feel that I don't have the right kind of
[1:10:44] understanding and wisdom that your
[1:10:46] people deserve.
[1:10:48] So Lord, will you give me wisdom? Cuz I
[1:10:51] feel foolish. I feel naive. I feel like
[1:10:53] a child. Could you give me an
[1:10:55] understanding heart so I can know your
[1:10:57] people and when they bring their
[1:10:59] problems, I won't judge them harshly or
[1:11:01] incorrectly. When they come to me for
[1:11:03] wisdom, I can actually have wisdom that
[1:11:05] is brings the fruit of peace and
[1:11:07] achieves an equitable result.
[1:11:10] And Solomon asked for wisdom and
[1:11:13] understanding to discern justice.
[1:11:16] Lord, you said that he asked for the
[1:11:18] right thing, so you gave it to him. And
[1:11:19] you gave him to him in abundance more
[1:11:22] than any other king had.
[1:11:24] And because he asked for the right
[1:11:25] thing, you actually blessed him and
[1:11:27] prospered him as a man and as a king
[1:11:28] naturally.
[1:11:31] And Lord, as we see that wisdom
[1:11:33] exercised in a difficult situation,
[1:11:35] facing a mother and a supposed mother,
[1:11:38] how do we determine, how do we decide?
[1:11:41] You gave him wisdom for the moment.
[1:11:44] And he said, "Bring me a sword." And
[1:11:47] tonight, Father, I stand here and I say,
[1:11:49] Lord, I need your sword. I need your
[1:11:51] word for what I'm going through. And I
[1:11:54] ask for the sword of your word to be
[1:11:56] placed into this hand of faith
[1:11:59] to use it, Lord, not just in life
[1:12:01] generally, but for right now, the season
[1:12:03] I'm in, the battle I'm in, the fight
[1:12:05] that's raging. Lord, give me the wisdom
[1:12:09] that I need. And Father, with this sword
[1:12:12] and with this word, I believe that a
[1:12:15] hand of faith will know how to use it
[1:12:17] and rightly divide between right and
[1:12:18] wrong and not be a child anymore, but
[1:12:21] can discern between good and evil and
[1:12:22] know how to go out into how to come in.
[1:12:25] May we, Father, receive wisdom which is
[1:12:28] from above.
[1:12:32] We ask for it, Lord, and ask it for your
[1:12:36] people
[1:12:37] that tonight. I trust it's ministered
[1:12:39] grace to the hear.
[1:12:43] And may it create
[1:12:46] an awareness and a longing for godly
[1:12:49] wisdom. Commit the people to you
[1:12:51] tonight, praying that you bless us.
[1:12:54] Thank you for the word,
[1:12:57] wisdom to rightly divide truth. In the
[1:13:00] name Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
