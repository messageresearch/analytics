[0:00] But I want to take my title tonight is
[0:02] complexes caused by complicated love.
[0:05] Again, this is a title that is
[0:07] descriptive. I would love to take some
[0:10] time and and kind of recapture some of
[0:12] the things we ministered on Sunday. Uh
[0:14] we are going to be continuing on the
[0:16] same subject on perfect love. I just
[0:19] want to go further than what we
[0:20] ministered Sunday. And really, you're
[0:22] just going to have to draw on some of it
[0:23] because I think it's necessary uh to be
[0:25] where we are this evening. But for
[0:27] brevity and time sake, I'd really like
[0:29] to just go forward in this. So this is
[0:31] descriptive complexes caused by
[0:34] complicated love. And we're looking at
[0:36] God's perfect love. And in particular
[0:39] with last service and even some of the
[0:41] first few services as we set this up,
[0:43] we're wanting to look at how God's
[0:45] perfect love is removing all sorts of
[0:47] barriers and things that are hindering
[0:50] the expression of perfect love in us.
[0:52] And if we want to look at perfect love
[0:53] as being the indwelling of the Holy
[0:54] Ghost in our souls and we look at the
[0:57] expression of perfect love being the
[0:58] fruits of the spirit that are lived out
[1:00] in us, no matter how that you look at
[1:02] it, we realize that our expression of
[1:04] the Holy Ghost is imperfect, but we
[1:07] desire to be perfect. We desire to
[1:09] accurately reflect uh the nature of
[1:12] Christ that is on on the inside of us.
[1:14] We look at we could look at themes of
[1:15] growing and maturing and pushing things
[1:17] out. that would be very relevant in this
[1:21] thought. But we're looking at how God's
[1:22] perfect love, which is perfect, is
[1:24] perfecting us and pushing things out and
[1:28] releasing things and removing things so
[1:30] that we can manifest our perfect love.
[1:32] And one of the uh significant scriptures
[1:35] we've been looking at is in 1 John 4:1
[1:37] 18. And it says, "There is no fear in
[1:40] love, but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:43] because fear hath torment. He that
[1:46] fearth is not made perfect in love. We
[1:48] used the scripture and talked about a
[1:49] litmus test that if I'm afraid, I must
[1:52] not have perfect love. Or if I'm afraid,
[1:54] maybe God doesn't love me. And there was
[1:56] all sorts of ways that we turned it into
[1:57] a formula that in the a in the existence
[2:00] of fear or the absence of no fear,
[2:02] however you'd want to put that, in the
[2:03] absence of doubt. And I'm just always
[2:05] confident. I'm always on top of a
[2:07] mountain. Um if you don't have that,
[2:09] then somehow your faith uh is not uh
[2:13] valid. um you're not made perfect in
[2:15] love. It kind of leaves this sense of
[2:17] not in a positive way of wanting more,
[2:19] but you just feel that you're lacking
[2:20] and you're insufficient. And I trust
[2:23] that through the first four services in
[2:25] this, we've said enough about this and
[2:26] brought it through the word of God to
[2:28] where we're not thinking that way
[2:29] anymore, but we're recognizing that his
[2:31] love is perfect and mine is being
[2:33] perfected. And that here John says this
[2:36] not kind of in a vacuum to say, "Hey, if
[2:38] you say that you love God and you have
[2:39] doubt, then you don't really love God."
[2:41] or to say that if you say that you love
[2:42] God and have fear then his love hasn't
[2:44] done anything for you. He's saying it
[2:46] specifically about boldness uh and our
[2:49] attitude towards God in not being in
[2:52] fear of being judged because he's saying
[2:54] uh that there should be no fear when it
[2:56] comes to opinion his opinion of you
[2:58] because he loves you and if he loves you
[3:01] I mean that that is enough it wouldn't
[3:03] matter nothing else should matter that
[3:05] if he loves you that should give you
[3:06] that give you that emotional security a
[3:09] and cause you to feel secure in his love
[3:11] and say then I'm not worried about his
[3:13] opinion of me I'm not worried if he
[3:14] thinks I make make a mistake because his
[3:16] love is a corrective love. I'm not
[3:18] worried uh what he knows about me, past
[3:20] or future, if he loves me, uh that is
[3:23] significant enough. And so he's he's
[3:25] trying to address I think we called it
[3:27] emotional safety or even emotional
[3:28] security or that psychological safety as
[3:31] the term may be used in certain
[3:33] instances, but he's referring
[3:36] specifically to our understanding of
[3:38] God's love. And he said, if we fear him,
[3:39] then maybe something's not right because
[3:41] if he loves you, you shouldn't have
[3:43] anything to be afraid of. That's good.
[3:44] And so if we're emotionally insecure,
[3:47] then we do not fully understand God's
[3:49] love. And if you think about love being
[3:52] an essential quality of God or God is
[3:54] love and then there's always more of God
[3:56] to understand and God's going to unfold
[3:58] throughout eternity, you realize, well,
[3:59] that's an easy statement to make that we
[4:01] don't fully understand God love because
[4:03] that's probably what we're always going
[4:05] to be enjoying in experiencing forever
[4:08] is his love. And so if we're emotionally
[4:11] insecure and that we fear God and we
[4:13] fear shame or we fear rejection or we
[4:15] think that God's just going to kind of
[4:16] string us along for a while as the elect
[4:19] and then one day de deelect us or veto
[4:21] his vote or something. Uh then we don't
[4:24] understand God's love for us. In 1 John
[4:28] 3:16 it says hereby perceive we the love
[4:32] of God because he laid down his life for
[4:34] us. And so he's saying that this
[4:36] particular action made manifest the love
[4:39] of God and we understand his love in
[4:41] that he lived uh he laid down his life
[4:44] for us. And then this is the
[4:46] extraordinary statement and we ought to
[4:48] lay down our lives for the brethren. Now
[4:52] that is a heavy statement and we've
[4:54] emphasized this on this last service how
[4:57] that it's one thing for God for us to
[4:59] understand the love of God and to love
[5:01] him back. I think we find that difficult
[5:03] enough for him to then turn around and
[5:05] say then you must love one another and
[5:07] and and it's in you're all familiar when
[5:09] Jesus says be therefore perfect even as
[5:11] your heavenly father is imperfect. He
[5:13] said it in the context of loving one
[5:14] another and so it is important that we
[5:18] love one another and I would say to do
[5:19] so with the perfect love and have the
[5:21] right expression of love and brotherly
[5:23] kindness and do good unto all men and do
[5:25] good especially to the household of
[5:27] faith and we recognize a lot of those
[5:29] admonitions in the scripture. But now he
[5:31] says that uh this love is going to be
[5:33] manifested. It what the love that's been
[5:35] manifested to us. We ought to lay down
[5:37] our lives for the brethren. And uh I
[5:40] think that we need to be careful in
[5:42] terms of what that looks like. Uh but
[5:44] it's certainly a command that we ought
[5:46] to have a self-sacrificing love that we
[5:49] ought to be willing to lay our lives
[5:51] down. But and I think that that
[5:54] particular part the love others and to
[5:57] and to show that kind of uh expression
[6:00] of love to others becomes maybe uh that
[6:03] area I think we called it kind of the
[6:05] horizontal aspect where we have so many
[6:07] things that hinder us and make it very
[6:08] very difficult for us to love. And so I
[6:11] I'm wanting to look at that in greater
[6:13] detail but I feel that I'm having to
[6:15] address the love that we share with God
[6:16] and his love for us to put us in a
[6:18] better place to be able to love others
[6:20] correctly.
[6:21] Amen. And so he's saying hereby perceive
[6:23] we the love of God. He's he's dealing
[6:26] with perception of God's love. Perceive
[6:28] means to know and to understand. And he
[6:31] says this is how we perceive the love of
[6:33] God. And if I could kind of express it
[6:35] this way and kind of amplify it a little
[6:36] bit, let's just say we if we did not
[6:39] know God's love, God manifests
[6:41] something. He does something. And in
[6:43] giving his son, he has done something.
[6:46] This is an act of love that we could
[6:48] see. And if we could see it, it declares
[6:50] and manifests to us his love. So this is
[6:53] how we can catch the love of God. This
[6:54] is how we can see the love of God.
[6:56] Hereby perceive we the love of God. This
[6:58] is how we know and understand God's love
[7:00] for us because he laid down his life for
[7:03] us. And so John is talking about
[7:06] understanding an image of love. And one
[7:09] thing that I've been thinking about a
[7:10] lot is what does love look like? And
[7:12] what does love look like? A and so we're
[7:15] asking what it looks like, not what what
[7:17] does love have to do with it. We're
[7:18] asking a different question about love,
[7:20] saying what does it look like? And I
[7:22] think it's a good question because I was
[7:24] been back going back over the parable of
[7:26] the good Samaritan and if you carry
[7:29] these things to an illogical extreme or
[7:32] take it outside the context that's being
[7:34] taught in the scripture, then we would
[7:36] never make it to wherever we were going.
[7:38] Because at the first uh intersection,
[7:40] you'd give all your money to the
[7:41] homeless people and then you'd drive a
[7:43] little bit further. you see somebody
[7:44] who's broke down on the side of the road
[7:45] and need to change their tire and then
[7:47] you'd go to a grocery store and someone
[7:49] say, "Oh, I don't have enough for this."
[7:50] You're like, "Well, let me buy all that
[7:51] for you." And before your day is over
[7:53] with, you're done being a good Samaritan
[7:56] to everybody's in that's in need. And
[7:57] then you take a step back and realize
[7:59] that's not what Jesus was asking us to
[8:01] do. And so this uh there's an expression
[8:06] of love. There's a way that love is
[8:08] being made manifest. And so God made his
[8:10] love manifest in that he sent his son to
[8:12] die for us. And so John is speaking of
[8:14] an image of love and he's saying that
[8:16] this is how we understand love is when
[8:19] God manifests it. As Jesus said in John
[8:22] 15:13, "Greater love hath no man than
[8:25] this that a man laid down his life for
[8:27] his friends." And so I want you to catch
[8:30] how that Jesus says, "Greater love hath
[8:33] no man." So if I could put it this way,
[8:35] man may have love, but no man has this
[8:37] great of a love. Greater love hath no
[8:39] man than this. This is the greatest
[8:41] love. God's love is a greater love. We
[8:43] use filelio love and agape love as a way
[8:45] of kind of understanding that there's a
[8:47] love that surpasses human emotion.
[8:49] Filelio we could say is a love of
[8:51] affections and passions a and and and
[8:54] that that's a that's a kind of a base
[8:56] nature that any person could have. And
[8:58] God's love we we use agape maybe to
[9:01] indicate that. And we're not real
[9:03] legalistic on those definitions and
[9:05] those use of the words in scripture, but
[9:06] it's used to understand that there's a
[9:08] love that maybe all of us share and it's
[9:10] a human love, but there's a love of a
[9:12] higher intelligence. There's a love
[9:14] which is God's love that is greater than
[9:16] our human love.
[9:18] And so in in looking at this that God's
[9:20] love is perfect. It's driving away fear.
[9:22] It's casting out fear. And we perceive
[9:24] God's love in this act of love that he
[9:26] gave his son. And this is the a greatest
[9:28] act of love. John is talking about
[9:30] perceiving, understanding, and knowing.
[9:32] He even says in John here by we or he
[9:34] says, "We have known and believed the
[9:36] love that God has to us." And how many
[9:38] would really want to be able to say that
[9:40] and be right.
[9:41] I know and believe the love that God has
[9:43] to me. So, this is something that is at
[9:46] the core of what John is teaching in
[9:47] First John. But let me say this as we
[9:50] take a step further that understanding
[9:52] God's love is especially difficult given
[9:55] what we already know and see. not
[9:57] necessarily about God, but about love.
[10:00] Brother Bam makes this statement. I know
[10:02] that you've been thinking about this
[10:03] several times already through these last
[10:05] few services. He writes this in the
[10:07] church age book, talking about the Jews
[10:08] going through the Holocaust and being uh
[10:11] uh murdered by the the millions and the
[10:13] just the the tremendous suffering that
[10:16] they went through uh during World War
[10:18] II. He says, you see, they could not
[10:19] figure out God's love. And and he's
[10:22] talking about people's looking at these
[10:24] are the chosen ones. these are God's
[10:25] people and they're being uh the
[10:27] Holocaust, this genocide. And he's
[10:29] talking about how people say, "How could
[10:30] God sit back with arms folded and watch
[10:32] his children suffer? How could he even
[10:34] throughout history let babies be
[10:35] stripped from mother's arms and people
[10:37] be slaughtered? And how could God let
[10:39] these things happen to his children?" He
[10:41] says, "They could not figure out God's
[10:44] love." They thought that love meant no
[10:46] suffering. They thought that love meant
[10:48] a baby with parental care. And that's
[10:50] where I get the saying, uh, love is not
[10:52] what you think it is. And love doesn't
[10:54] always look what like what we think it
[10:56] should look like. So they couldn't make
[10:58] any proper image out of God's love. They
[11:00] could not figure out God's love. They
[11:02] thought it meant no suffering. They
[11:03] thought it meant um a baby with parental
[11:06] care. But God said, excuse me, that his
[11:09] love was elective love. That's it. God
[11:11] said that his love is elective love. And
[11:15] so the question is, well, when God
[11:16] allows his children to suffer uh and
[11:19] then how could this be love? Because a
[11:21] mother wouldn't let their baby suffer,
[11:22] would she? And how could God let his
[11:25] children suffer? Because a parent would
[11:27] never let his children go through
[11:28] something like this. And so we know that
[11:31] God loves his children. So we could say
[11:33] when God allows his children to suffer,
[11:35] it causes confusion about the love of
[11:37] God. If God loved the Jews, then why
[11:40] would he let them suffer to this
[11:41] magnitude?
[11:43] And as brother Brandham says, uh, they
[11:45] thought it meant no suffering and they
[11:47] thought it meant the phrase to me, uh,
[11:49] it conveys a much larger thought than
[11:52] just the quick sentence he gives it, but
[11:53] they thought it meant a baby with
[11:54] parental care. In other words, they
[11:56] expect God, the expression of God's love
[11:58] to be that of a loving parent who
[12:01] shields the baby from any trials, any
[12:03] suffering, and would never want it to
[12:05] hurt and in some ways, I guess, always
[12:07] stay a baby a and never let it
[12:10] experience hurt, never let it go out
[12:12] into the world uh uh just to to to learn
[12:15] and to grow. And so he thinks that
[12:18] that's what love is or that's what
[12:20] people think love is. And so there's
[12:22] some attribution of human
[12:24] characteristics to God's love. Say,
[12:26] well, this is how a human would act and
[12:28] this is what love looks like for humans,
[12:30] but that if God's not doing this, that
[12:32] causes the confusion.
[12:34] And let me say this, and it's maybe a
[12:36] necessary transition. It's not
[12:37] unreasonable
[12:39] to to feel this way because God himself
[12:42] compares his love to human experiences
[12:44] or human relationships. Uh I if if God
[12:48] just said, "I love you as God loves you,
[12:50] and I love you in a way that only the
[12:51] divine can, and my love is a supreme
[12:53] love, and he kind of just spoke in a way
[12:55] that's about this this God behind this
[12:57] curtain that you'll never see." Then the
[12:59] love would forever, without any hope at
[13:01] all, be like, "Well, what does that look
[13:03] like? And what does that feel like? And
[13:04] what could it be like?" So God, in an
[13:06] effort to get us to start thinking about
[13:08] love, compares his love to natural loves
[13:11] that we might be familiar with. in Luke
[13:14] 11:es 9-113. Actually, we'll we'll kind
[13:17] of hold verse 13 off a little bit and
[13:19] come back to it. But notice how Jesus is
[13:22] using parental relationship to
[13:25] understand our relationship to God. He
[13:26] says, "I say unto you, ask and it shall
[13:28] be given you. Seek and ye shall find.
[13:31] Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
[13:33] For everyone that askketh receiveth, and
[13:36] he that seeketh findeth, and to him that
[13:38] knockketh it shall be open." What
[13:40] encouragement, right? saying, "Hey, seek
[13:42] and you'll find and knock, it'll be
[13:44] open." And he's wanting to encourage you
[13:46] to be bold to ask and to ask your
[13:48] father. And if there be any kind of
[13:51] trepidation or a lack of release in a
[13:53] person's spirit to say, "Yeah, I want to
[13:55] seek because I'm going to find and I
[13:56] want to ask and I'll receive. I want to
[13:58] knock and it's going to be open." He
[14:00] wants the the the hearers to start
[14:02] thinking about other relationships where
[14:04] there might be a request made and say,
[14:06] "Hey, why wouldn't you ask God? Because
[14:08] you ask others and you get what you
[14:10] want."
[14:10] So he says, "If a son," so now he's
[14:12] talking about fatherto son relationship,
[14:14] a parental relationship. "If a son shall
[14:17] ask bread of any of you that is a
[14:19] father," so now he's even want the
[14:20] fathers to put themselves in these
[14:22] shoes, will he give him a stone? Or if
[14:25] he ask a fish, will he for a fish give
[14:28] him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an
[14:30] egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
[14:33] Now the questions are what we call
[14:35] rhetorical questions where the answer is
[14:37] assumed or it's kind of already implied
[14:38] in the question that in other words you
[14:40] can make the statement if your son asked
[14:43] you for bread you wouldn't give him a
[14:44] stone. If your son asked you for a fish
[14:46] you wouldn't give him a serpent. If he
[14:47] asked for an egg you wouldn't give him a
[14:49] scorpion. And he's saying it as a matter
[14:51] of fact. I don't think that he was
[14:53] taking a poll and say well I mean God
[14:54] would if you ask God he'd give you but
[14:57] how about you guys? I mean if your son
[14:58] asked for an egg would you give him a
[14:59] scorpion? It's not a poll just to kind
[15:02] of find out take everybody else's
[15:03] temperature. He's using the parents love
[15:05] for a child to understand God's love.
[15:08] He said you that love your children. He
[15:10] says a man who's a father like you, you
[15:12] that have a father, if someone ask of
[15:15] any of you that are a father for bread,
[15:17] are you going to give him a stone? But
[15:20] and he's saying and what's he
[15:21] compelling? The love that you have, the
[15:22] care that you have for your child is
[15:25] what will cause you to answer his
[15:27] request and even maybe create some sort
[15:29] of obligation and then to recognize the
[15:32] need that he has. Because I think it's
[15:34] important to recognize that it's not
[15:35] saying that if if if the son asked his
[15:38] father for a switch, would you just give
[15:40] him uh Candyland
[15:45] or sorry or you just say I'm sorry. It's
[15:48] not just saying anything, but it's it's
[15:50] relevant. it has something to do with
[15:52] care and necessity. So, he's using the
[15:54] love of a father for his son that to get
[15:57] someone to think, "Oh, well, yeah, I
[15:58] mean, it's in these natural
[15:59] relationships, if this is what happens,
[16:01] then of course, uh, uh, God, if I'm his
[16:04] son, would treat me that way." Now, I
[16:07] want to say this that Jesus is using
[16:10] what ought to be our general expectation
[16:13] from a parent. Because some of us could
[16:15] say, "Yeah, I've I've specifically asked
[16:18] my father for egg and he gave me a
[16:20] scorpion." Or in some way, you've looked
[16:23] for the necessity, the love that you
[16:26] needed from a parental figure and didn't
[16:28] get it. So, we realize that this is what
[16:30] what Jesus is saying. This is the
[16:32] general expectation from a normal
[16:34] relationship between a father and a son.
[16:36] It's not just here in Luke 11 that he
[16:38] makes the comparison, but in Psalm 103
[16:41] verse 13, like as a father pity his
[16:44] children, so the Lord pityth them that
[16:47] fear him. And I know you're all
[16:48] thinking, pityith, how pitiful. But the
[16:52] word is literally a father that loves
[16:55] his son or his children. It means to
[16:58] love deeply, to have tender affection
[17:00] for, have compassion. So speaking the
[17:03] affections of love, it says like a
[17:05] father loves his children. As a father
[17:07] has compassion for his children and has
[17:10] tender affection for him, he's saying
[17:11] the Lord has love and tender affection
[17:14] for them that fear him. So it's using
[17:16] the example of a parent's compassion and
[17:19] love for a child to get the person to
[17:21] think that's how God loves me likewise.
[17:24] And not only does he use the example of
[17:26] a father, but in Isaiah 66:13, he uses
[17:29] that of a mother as one whom his mother
[17:32] comforteth, so will I comfort you, and
[17:34] ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
[17:37] Again, God is using the office of a
[17:40] father, the the the labor, the love of a
[17:42] mother to cause us to think of his love
[17:44] for us. As a mother would comfort her
[17:46] child, as one whom a mother would show
[17:49] that consolation and want to assure them
[17:52] and affirm them and make them feel safe
[17:54] or secure, he says, "I'll do the same
[17:56] for you." And this speaks to, if I could
[17:59] say this, and I don't know if I'm
[18:00] getting ahead of myself, but because
[18:04] God is using these loves as a type of
[18:08] his love, and I believe it speaks to
[18:11] just how much it hurts when those loves
[18:14] aren't right.
[18:15] Right?
[18:16] Because God uses them as an expression
[18:18] of his love. And as we'll read later, uh
[18:22] this we're to the way that we raise our
[18:24] children. Our our children are first
[18:26] learning about the love of God and how
[18:27] that we treat them. And they're first
[18:30] learning to obey God and how that they
[18:31] obey us. And so there's such a critical
[18:34] stage there where we are those uh we
[18:36] even realize maybe we're the Holy Ghost
[18:37] to them and we're teaching them to love
[18:39] God and we're claiming to be the
[18:40] Christians. So there's so much that
[18:42] we're expressing and signaling to our
[18:44] children about God in the way that we
[18:46] love them.
[18:48] In Hebrews chapter 12, I'd like to just
[18:50] read this and maybe not go slowly
[18:52] through it, but verses 7 to 10, it says,
[18:54] "If ye endure chastening, God dealeth
[18:56] with you as with sons." I think that
[18:58] relationship of us as children of God is
[19:00] very clear in scripture. For what son is
[19:03] he whom the father chastineth not. So
[19:05] fathers correct their children. But if
[19:07] you be without chastisement, whereof all
[19:09] are partakers, you then you are bastards
[19:12] and not sons. And now Paul again wanting
[19:15] us to understand this relationship that
[19:17] we would have with God and his ability
[19:18] to correct us or his desire to correct
[19:20] us says furthermore we've had fathers of
[19:23] our flesh which corrected us and we gave
[19:25] them reverence. Shall we not much rather
[19:28] be in subjection to the fathers of
[19:29] spirits and live. I remember how much
[19:32] the Bible teaches us to honor our father
[19:34] and mother
[19:35] and the law of thy father, the law of
[19:37] the mother, the word of the father. And
[19:38] there's ways that there's so much in the
[19:40] scripture that teaches us to show the
[19:42] honor and to reverence them. And so he's
[19:45] saying that we've had fathers of our
[19:47] flesh that corrected us and we honored
[19:48] them. We gave them reverence. Then what
[19:50] about to God
[19:52] in that relationship? Should we not
[19:54] honor him? And he says this, "For they
[19:56] verily for a few days chasened us after
[19:59] their own pleasure." And I know what
[20:00] you're thinking. A few days?
[20:02] How about at least a dozen years? says,
[20:05] "For they verily for a few days chasened
[20:07] us." Or maybe that's telling us that
[20:09] whenever we chasen, we ought to make it
[20:10] for a few days. Like none of this it's
[20:13] done. You know, we've addressed this.
[20:14] It's like we're going to make you suffer
[20:16] for a few days. We should talk parents.
[20:18] We should convene on this. Tom, maybe
[20:20] we're not letting the punishment linger
[20:22] long enough.
[20:25] But he says, "For they verilely for a
[20:26] few days chasened us after their own
[20:28] pleasure." We just get the image of
[20:29] somebody spanking somebody for 72 hours.
[20:32] for they chasened us after their own
[20:34] pleasure
[20:35] and I and I think the children are like
[20:37] yeah I think they enjoy it but he for
[20:40] our profit that we might be partakers of
[20:42] his holiness. So there is a distinction
[20:46] as we read this. There's a distinction
[20:47] that emerges between his love and the
[20:50] type because Paul is now all of a suen
[20:53] he's using it that fathers do this and
[20:55] God the father does this and fathers do
[20:57] this and God is your father does that
[20:58] and we gave them reverence and you have
[21:00] to give him reence and he's kind of just
[21:02] it's just a slight thing here. He says
[21:04] your parents corrected you after their
[21:06] own pleasure. In other words, what they
[21:07] thought was right, not because they
[21:10] enjoy it and that they've all been liars
[21:12] whoever said, "Son, this is going to
[21:13] hurt you more than it hurts me." But
[21:15] it's it's after what they believe is
[21:18] right, what they think is best. Says
[21:21] that children, the children, your
[21:23] parents corrected you after what they
[21:25] thought was best. But he says, "But he,
[21:27] for our profit, that's to me that's
[21:29] incredible statement. They did what was
[21:32] best for us, but their love is not
[21:34] infallible."
[21:35] that when they correct maybe they don't
[21:37] always do it correctly. Even the things
[21:39] they're correcting they may not be
[21:41] exactly right about. So Paul is saying
[21:43] he's just it's just ever so slight. He
[21:45] says they did it after their own
[21:47] pleasure and what they thought was
[21:48] right. But God when he does it he does
[21:50] it for our profit. So if I got to say if
[21:53] I could say it this way human love is
[21:55] not always profitable.
[21:57] that in other words, there's times when
[21:59] our parents have corrected us. And
[22:01] brother R, if you want to say amen,
[22:03] don't don't hold back.
[22:05] Your sister Morgan's not here tonight,
[22:07] so this is your chance to just really
[22:10] bring it. But there's there's times when
[22:13] our parents have corrected us and it's
[22:16] not it doesn't bring forth even this.
[22:18] Maybe the parents need to amen this. It
[22:20] hasn't brought forth the results that
[22:21] you thought it would.
[22:23] Like, man, I thought that would just set
[22:25] things straight, but now it's worse. So
[22:27] I think we could understand that in love
[22:28] we correct and it's part of our our
[22:31] instinct as parents. It's part of a love
[22:33] that's being expressed that we correct
[22:35] after what we believe is right. We
[22:36] correct the things that we know are
[22:37] wrong or that we think are wrong. But
[22:39] it's not always profitable.
[22:41] But God is always profitable.
[22:45] He he he doesn't correct us and go, "Oh,
[22:47] I'm sorry. I got it wrong." I think I've
[22:49] expressed this to you before. Am I my
[22:52] some of my biggest struggles as a parent
[22:54] is you're you're you're just doing
[22:56] you're you're you're working and you're
[22:58] getting stuff done and and brother Jack
[23:01] will always ask me, "Dad, what are you
[23:02] doing?" I said, "I'm working to buy you
[23:04] toys." That's why I know he just thinks
[23:06] that one day there's some gigantic
[23:07] payoff of about, you know, 55,000 toys
[23:10] sitting somewhere because now for his
[23:12] whole life, I'm working to buy you toys.
[23:14] And then he when he knows I'm studying,
[23:16] there's no toys that come out of that
[23:17] because then I say I'm studying. And
[23:20] then all of a sudden it's like, "Oh,
[23:21] dad, somebody did this to me." So you go
[23:23] find somebody and you're going to read
[23:24] somebody the riot act like, "But the
[23:26] other person did this to me." And you're
[23:27] like, "Oh, so the other person," you go
[23:28] over there and say, "But they did this."
[23:30] And you you feel foolish
[23:33] because you don't know who to ground.
[23:35] You don't know who to correct. You don't
[23:36] know who's wrong. You're like, "So you
[23:37] did this and then you did that and then
[23:40] oh, but he did that. Oh, but then he did
[23:42] that. Oh. Oh, but but then you did that.
[23:44] Like, all right, who's born first?
[23:47] Whoever was born first, you started it,
[23:49] right? Because it had to start
[23:50] somewhere.
[23:52] At least I know that's the cross I bore
[23:54] in my family as being the oldest boy
[23:57] that no matter what happened, I think
[23:58] even to this day, even though I don't
[24:00] live anywhere near my siblings, I
[24:02] guarantee you I'm still to blame for
[24:03] anything they do wrong.
[24:06] But we rec there's this there's this
[24:08] understanding that we know we don't
[24:10] always get it right.
[24:13] But it's our love that we're trying to
[24:14] fulfill.
[24:16] And so parental love is not perfect.
[24:19] Parents, I you should probably Amen.
[24:21] It's probably not safe for the kids to
[24:22] be doing that. And we know that in
[24:25] loving, we struggle to express it
[24:27] perfectly.
[24:29] And so as Jesus is using this comparison
[24:32] in Lukeap 11, in Psalms 103, God uses
[24:34] it. Isaiah 66 and Hebrews 12, Paul using
[24:37] it this comparison. We read in Luke
[24:39] 11:13, it says this. If ye then being
[24:42] evil know how to give good gifts unto
[24:45] your children, how much more? So again,
[24:48] it's speaking to where we can understand
[24:51] something in the type there. There's
[24:53] some material to work with there to
[24:55] begin to build an understanding of God's
[24:56] love. But he's saying, but you know
[24:58] what? We're evil. We we we're not
[25:00] perfect. Paul is saying in Hebrews 12,
[25:02] we're not perfect. We don't always do
[25:04] the things that we ought to do. If you
[25:05] then being evil and not being imperfect,
[25:07] know how to give good gifts to your
[25:08] children, how much more shall your
[25:10] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[25:12] them that ask him,
[25:13] right?
[25:14] This is the greater, more profitable
[25:16] love. Parental love is great. Parental
[25:19] love is profitable. Parental love uh is
[25:22] a type of God's love, but God's love is
[25:24] the perfect love.
[25:26] And we know that our human love falters,
[25:29] but God's love never fails.
[25:32] That's right.
[25:32] It's what we learned from 1 Corinthians
[25:34] 13. these characteristics of love. It
[25:38] says in Isaiah 49:15, I want to use this
[25:41] just to show that our love can falter.
[25:42] It says, "Can a woman forget her sucking
[25:44] child that she should not have
[25:46] compassion on the son of son of her
[25:47] womb?" It's asking the question uh can a
[25:51] woman forget her children? And there is
[25:53] something incredible. I believe we
[25:54] ministered on this in the past on
[25:55] Mother's Day. How that there's some
[25:57] there's a power that's loosed in a woman
[25:59] whenever she has a child. and that
[26:02] there's circumstances could happen in a
[26:04] person's life and they may cease to be a
[26:06] wife and there's certain relationships
[26:08] that can dissolve, but there's something
[26:09] special about the bond between a parent
[26:11] and child to when no matter what happens
[26:13] in life, you're always a mother and you
[26:16] always experience the pains and love
[26:18] that a mother has. And so, it's a a
[26:20] great question. Can a mom forget her
[26:22] child that she would not have love for
[26:24] her son? And notice what he says. Yeah,
[26:27] they may forget.
[26:31] Yeah, they might. A mother may forget.
[26:34] Not that she would forget that the
[26:35] child's her son, but she forgets how to
[26:37] love him. She She doesn't have the right
[26:40] kind of compassion and through
[26:41] circumstances and estrangement or
[26:43] distance or whatever. She she does not
[26:45] have that love. She does not have the
[26:47] purity purity in the love. It says,
[26:50] "Yes, they may forget, yet will I not
[26:52] forget thee."
[26:54] So, there's two things I'm wanting you
[26:55] to recognize here. How perfect the
[26:58] vertical relationship is to God. How
[27:00] perfect his love for us is, but then how
[27:03] in the horizontal and our relationships
[27:05] to other people, it's that human love
[27:07] that is imperfect.
[27:09] I said, yes, a mom may forget how to
[27:11] love her children correctly. She may not
[27:14] always have the right kind of
[27:15] compassion, but that's not so with God.
[27:18] So, notice how Paul addresses it in
[27:20] Ephesians 6:4. And and if I could say
[27:23] this, as we mentioned Sunday, the
[27:25] instructions are given to love and to
[27:27] love properly because it isn't just
[27:30] natural.
[27:32] It isn't just instinct. Though it might
[27:34] be easy to love and though there might
[27:36] be some instinct to love. That's not all
[27:38] that exists within that channel. That's
[27:41] not the only passion that is. If we were
[27:43] just creatures of one emotion and that
[27:45] was love, then you wouldn't have to say
[27:46] you wouldn't have to coach or to
[27:48] encourage or to say love your wife or to
[27:50] love your children. if there wasn't all
[27:52] these other emotions that are at your
[27:54] disposal.
[27:54] Right?
[27:56] So it says in Ephesians 6:4, "And ye
[27:58] fathers, provoke not your children to
[27:59] wrath, but bring them up in the nurture
[28:02] and admonition of the Lord." If I could
[28:04] put it this way, and I think this is the
[28:05] way that I often like to describe it,
[28:06] because of the human weakness,
[28:09] because the other emotions that we could
[28:11] give ourselves over to, Christian
[28:12] parents are taught to love like the
[28:16] Lord, to bring them up in the nurture
[28:17] and admonition of the Lord. In other
[28:19] words, you want your nurture to be like
[28:21] God's. You want your admonition to be
[28:22] like God's. Or you want to be to the
[28:24] Lord also
[28:26] because of human weakness. If you say,
[28:27] "Well, I got the Holy Ghost. I know how
[28:28] to be a perfect parent and it's going to
[28:30] be as if Christ was raising my children.
[28:32] It's going to be divinity all the time
[28:33] in the home." A and if that's the way
[28:36] that it was, then Paul could just skip
[28:38] right over that. But it's something that
[28:40] has to be taught because of the human
[28:41] condition. Provoke not your children to
[28:43] wrath. And then in Colossians 3:21,
[28:46] fathers, provoke not your children to
[28:48] anger, lest they be discouraged.
[28:51] Now, Paul is not assuming that you're
[28:53] just all brutes and you're insensitive
[28:54] and you have to be reminded every
[28:56] morning you gave birth to this child or
[28:58] this is the fruit of your loins. It's
[28:59] not that we forget that. He's saying the
[29:01] the love is there. The desire ought to
[29:04] be there. At least we'd say the general
[29:06] expectation
[29:07] is that a parent is going to have love
[29:08] for the children. Can I get an can I get
[29:11] a witness from the parents? I mean, can
[29:13] you not testify of just what an
[29:14] extraordinary feeling you felt when you
[29:17] first had a child?
[29:19] You know, where did this come from?
[29:21] Right? It's it's unexplainable. And no
[29:24] matter how much you think about, oh, oh,
[29:26] you know, I I can't wait. I can't wait.
[29:28] It's going to be awesome. And no matter
[29:29] how much you think it's going to be a
[29:30] certain way, nothing prepares you for
[29:32] the moment because nothing in life has
[29:34] ever been anything like that.
[29:37] And so it's an it's an incredible thing
[29:39] that there's something an immediate love
[29:41] for something. I'll even say this as
[29:44] from a dad's perspective. No matter how
[29:46] much you know there's life there in the
[29:48] womb that's going to be coming forth and
[29:49] you're falling in love with this life
[29:51] that's going to be coming and maybe you
[29:52] have a name and you're and it's been
[29:54] nine months and you're falling in love
[29:55] with this child, nothing prepares you
[29:57] for the connection that you have when
[29:59] that when the when the baby is born. And
[30:02] so it is it's an incredible thing and it
[30:04] it's godlike and it's something that the
[30:06] scripture speaks of how children are a
[30:08] heritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[30:09] the womb is something that's very very
[30:12] blessed and and I think the cry of the
[30:14] baby is just appropriate appropriate for
[30:17] the moment. That's the child's way of
[30:19] saying amen. Amen. Aren't I loved? And
[30:23] so if I could even say this to all the
[30:25] families, never uh never feel shame if
[30:28] your child uh child weeps because that's
[30:30] music to us. We're all family here.
[30:33] Believe it or not, we were all babies at
[30:35] one time. And some of you
[30:40] still
[30:44] uh but so there's something pure about
[30:46] the love that a parent has for a child
[30:47] or at least it ought to be. It begins
[30:49] that way. He says, "Fathers," in
[30:51] Colossians 3:21, "Fathers, provoke not
[30:53] your children to anger, lest they be
[30:55] discouraged." So these are admonitions
[30:57] to the father that you love your
[30:59] children. As a father, it's already
[31:01] talked about a as a father pityth his
[31:03] children. And Luke 11, all these
[31:04] different places, the God knows that a
[31:06] father loves his son. But now he's
[31:08] having to caution them because of
[31:10] weakness.
[31:11] Don't provoke your children to anger.
[31:13] Don't provoke them to wrath. But he
[31:15] says, "Lest they be discouraged."
[31:18] Despite parental love, despite parental
[31:20] affection, despite that unique bond that
[31:22] you share with the child, parents can
[31:25] says discouraged break the spirit of
[31:28] their child.
[31:30] It is not just merely that they would be
[31:32] disappointed. Dad, I really want to
[31:33] switch. Dad, I really want Huh. You want
[31:34] to switch? Go get one out of the yard,
[31:36] son. Go pull it off that tree. But that
[31:38] they could be asking for something and
[31:40] you kind of disappoint them or
[31:41] discourage them because you say no. But
[31:42] he's talking about actually causing a
[31:44] wound in their spirit,
[31:46] harming them, a breach, a break in the
[31:48] spirit to where all of a sudden now
[31:50] because of the relationship between a
[31:51] father to son, you do something in a way
[31:53] that causes a wound in a child's spirit.
[31:56] So Paul's saying, fathers, whatever you
[31:58] do, don't provoke your children to
[32:00] frustration and wrath. Don't provoke
[32:02] your children to anger because it can
[32:04] cause a wound in their spirit.
[32:07] You can do something to discourage them.
[32:08] You could do something to wound their
[32:10] spirits, to harm their hearts. And not
[32:12] only does that provoke them to where
[32:14] they're wounded towards you, but then
[32:16] also it's going to affect their
[32:17] perception of love.
[32:20] It's going to impact uh their emotional
[32:23] safety and their security.
[32:26] And so imperfect humans create complexes
[32:30] about God's perfect love.
[32:33] Imperfect communions. God compares his
[32:35] love to human love, but human love is
[32:37] not perfect. So imperfect human love
[32:40] creates complexes about God's love or I
[32:42] could say love in general.
[32:45] And so this fallible love forms and
[32:49] shapes our perception of love.
[32:51] This goes in our experience with friends
[32:53] and our experience with family and our
[32:55] experiences with the spouse. These are
[32:57] all relationships where there's trust or
[33:00] there's confidence or there's some sort
[33:01] of vulnerability. Uh there's uh making
[33:04] yourself subject to someone and opening
[33:06] your heart up and uh having feelings in
[33:09] such a way to where that per what that
[33:10] person says and how they feel counts and
[33:12] it can cause a weight and just as
[33:14] there's maybe and children do not opt
[33:17] for it. They have not chosen it, but
[33:18] they're born into a family. Uh they
[33:20] didn't choose their parents. And so now
[33:22] they're in a relationship and they're
[33:23] vulnerable to their parents. And the way
[33:26] their parents treat them and talk to
[33:27] them and raise them and nurture them is
[33:29] all kind of affecting their garden and
[33:31] their hearts and their conscience and
[33:32] their perception of love and the way
[33:34] that they're treated by parents and the
[33:36] way you're treated by friends and the
[33:38] way you're treated by family. All is
[33:40] kind of shaping whether you realize it
[33:42] or not. Subconsciously, it's shaping
[33:45] your per perception of love. You're
[33:48] thinking, "Well, what is love?" And,
[33:50] "Oh, well, I know my mom loves me, but
[33:51] she does this or I have friends and I
[33:53] trust friends." And there's ways that
[33:55] people don't realize it, but they're
[33:57] acting and treating other people the way
[33:59] they've always been treated. And though
[34:01] it made them feel uncomfortable and hurt
[34:03] them, they don't know that it's not
[34:06] right
[34:07] because that's just the way they've
[34:08] always been treated. I think we should
[34:11] have a lot of grace for people when we
[34:12] see them and first get to know them and
[34:14] they act a certain way. Like, man, why
[34:16] are they like that? Because they don't
[34:17] know any different.
[34:19] They just don't know any different and
[34:20] they think, "Oh, well, this is normal.
[34:22] This is what this is what we do and this
[34:24] is how it's done and this is how we
[34:25] act." But I will say this, I think on a
[34:28] on that if we were to stop and to think
[34:31] about it,
[34:33] we feel the affection of love, that
[34:36] feeling or emotion of love. So we can
[34:38] say that we love yet we realize there
[34:40] are emotions
[34:42] that hinder the love that we have. We
[34:45] realize that we can love and we are
[34:46] loving or towards something. We have
[34:47] some sort of affection but there's other
[34:49] things that pervert the expression of
[34:51] love. It's not only it's not always love
[34:53] that surfaces. Can I put it that way?
[34:55] That we know we have love for someone
[34:57] but it's not always love that surfaces.
[34:59] Anger, resentment, bitterness. There's a
[35:01] lot of things even jealousy can resides
[35:04] right within the same heart that loves.
[35:06] And that's not a that I'm not breaking a
[35:08] new mystery here. I'm not bringing
[35:10] something up. But maybe sometimes
[35:11] there's we don't like to think about it,
[35:12] but say, "Well, I love you and I have
[35:15] this love for you." And we have to
[35:17] realize that the same the same capacity
[35:20] to love and that same uh spirit that has
[35:23] that affection of love, it's the same
[35:25] one that has jealousy,
[35:26] same one has bitterness, the same has
[35:28] resentment, the same one has
[35:29] frustration. And again, if we were only
[35:31] creatures of one emotion and and we all
[35:33] were blessed with that of love, then
[35:35] this wouldn't be a problem. But because
[35:37] we could have a very intense love, but
[35:39] then also a very intense jealousy or
[35:40] very intense frustration or anger,
[35:43] therefore it's not always that that
[35:46] affection and passion of love is
[35:47] sometimes joined with or hindered by all
[35:50] these other feelings.
[35:52] And so I could say we love imperfectly.
[35:56] But then also we have been loved
[35:59] imperfectly
[36:01] and we have caused wounds by our
[36:03] imperfect love and we have suffered
[36:05] wounds of an imperfect love and
[36:08] therefore the wounds of love shape our
[36:11] perception of love. In some ways, we are
[36:15] Pavlov's dog that we've been conditioned
[36:18] by certain things that just get us
[36:20] thinking. And I think some of the
[36:22] buzzwords today would be triggered
[36:24] where, you know, nothing is meant by it,
[36:26] but just somebody can say, you know, I
[36:28] love you like a son. And we're like,
[36:29] great, another one, right? Just there's
[36:32] you just get this immediate feeling
[36:34] like, well, I guess I'm about to be
[36:35] taken advantage of. But there's it's
[36:38] just people live. I'm just saying it
[36:40] about my my neighbor next door. I've
[36:42] been counseling him here recently and uh
[36:44] he has a real difficult relationship
[36:46] with his dad. So, this is all very new
[36:49] to me. But he it's just something we
[36:52] could recognize that certain things are
[36:55] triggers to us and cause us to feel
[36:58] certain ways a and to and so we we we
[37:01] think of certain relationships like yeah
[37:02] well you know kind of sounds good on
[37:04] paper but in experience man it's it's
[37:06] not as nice as it seems. And there's
[37:08] ways where we could look at look at love
[37:11] and the dynamics of love and there might
[37:13] be a lot that we would desire and a lot
[37:15] of good that we've gotten from it. But
[37:16] it's all the imperfections of love
[37:18] sometimes that are the most pronounced
[37:19] kind of leave a bad taste in our mouths
[37:21] or that cause us to be a little bit
[37:23] apprehensive. And I know that I'm being
[37:25] I'm being general enough about these
[37:27] things to I think all of us understand
[37:29] exactly what I'm talking about. But this
[37:31] is in some ways a very narrow experience
[37:34] that this would be relevant. But it does
[37:37] affect our view of love.
[37:39] Now the most now the real damning part
[37:43] of that is we then just assign these
[37:46] same carnal characteristics to God's
[37:48] love.
[37:50] That God loves me like a father loves
[37:51] me. God loves me like a mother loves me.
[37:53] God is like the has that love of a
[37:55] parent. So God's love can be selfish. It
[37:58] can be conditional. It can be
[38:00] narcissistic. It can be inconsistent. It
[38:02] can be temporary. It can be only
[38:04] concerned with what it does for them.
[38:08] Come on. Right. Let's I mean, let's just
[38:10] be honest that even there's times maybe
[38:13] one of the things that we do
[38:14] instinctively as parents the most is we
[38:16] parent from the position of pride. Our
[38:18] children do something and we don't like
[38:19] the way that makes us look, right? And
[38:22] and maybe what they did was wrong, but
[38:24] we're kind of more moved by what that
[38:25] does for our reputation and it hurts our
[38:27] pride. So we correct from a point of
[38:29] pride instead of from the point of what
[38:31] doing what we need to do to promote
[38:33] virtue within the child.
[38:35] And so because we have these instincts
[38:37] to shame and to a and to grow cold or
[38:40] what and do the different things that we
[38:41] could do as humans, we just without
[38:44] thinking about it think that God will
[38:46] treat us the same way. Maybe we treat
[38:48] others
[38:50] that maybe because I'm selfish, God's
[38:51] going to be selfish with me or because I
[38:53] reject or I'm hard-hearted, then God's
[38:54] going to do it with me. or because this
[38:56] is the way that we have been treated
[38:58] that we ourselves will also treat others
[39:00] that we'll be treated the same way by
[39:01] God.
[39:02] Right?
[39:03] In Colossians chapter 3 19 it says,
[39:06] "Husbands, love your wives and be not
[39:08] bitter against them."
[39:12] We read this on Sunday. Love can be
[39:14] improperly expressed.
[39:17] And being improperly expressed, it can
[39:18] cause wounds of bitterness and
[39:20] frustration. So say love your wives but
[39:22] in loving your wife don't be bitter
[39:24] against them don't be harsh don't be
[39:26] hard and so it's expressing that
[39:29] temperamental uh nature of our human
[39:31] emotions or how that your love can often
[39:34] be hindered by bitterness
[39:37] and that love can be improperly
[39:38] expressed
[39:40] and being improperly expressed it can
[39:42] cause wounds of bitterness and
[39:43] frustration
[39:45] I think we've touched on this before so
[39:46] I think I could probably go through this
[39:48] very quickly Ezekiel 8 verse12 12 uses a
[39:51] phrase that is quite remarkable. It says
[39:53] speaks of how what they do in the dark
[39:57] every man in the chambers of his imagery
[40:00] and how this phrase the chambers of his
[40:01] imagery depicts the human heart as
[40:04] having rooms. It would be in his mind or
[40:06] in his spirit. It kind of it sets us up
[40:08] as having these chambers. And brother
[40:10] Brandham says now inside the human heart
[40:12] there are many little doors and then
[40:13] little doors cover up a lot of things.
[40:17] I want to read that again. Can you be
[40:18] sure that you're listening? Inside the
[40:21] human heart, there are many little doors
[40:23] and then little doors cover up a lot of
[40:26] things.
[40:28] This is so true. This is a subject he's
[40:30] preaching on doors and door.
[40:33] It's the concept that there's doors to
[40:35] our heart,
[40:36] right?
[40:36] As brother Brandon begins to outline it
[40:38] that in a house there's different rooms
[40:40] and how that it speaks of different uh
[40:42] different areas and different levels of
[40:43] intimacy. The human heart has many
[40:45] little doors and those doors cover up a
[40:47] lot of things. It's the chambers of our
[40:49] spirits, the chambers of our imagery. If
[40:52] I could say this, these wounds of love
[40:55] can reside and take place within the
[40:58] chambers of our heart.
[41:00] And I want to make the make the
[41:02] connection that wounds of love cause
[41:04] scars of love.
[41:06] And that scars are and I want to go
[41:09] through this very quickly, but scars are
[41:10] just they're part of the healing
[41:11] process. And but it once a wound heals
[41:15] you say oh it's healed when it leaves a
[41:17] scar the tissue that's there after it's
[41:19] healed is not the same as the tissue
[41:20] before
[41:22] just in the natural healing process that
[41:24] when a scar exists it doesn't have the
[41:27] same functionality of the skin or the
[41:29] place the part of the body that was
[41:31] wounded and this is an example I often
[41:34] use when I'm using this example or using
[41:36] the subject of scars that a heart attack
[41:39] they say all heart attacks cause some
[41:41] amount of scarring
[41:43] on the heart. That's why you could go in
[41:44] and have your heart looked at and a
[41:45] doctor could say, "You've had a heart
[41:47] attack before." And you're like, "No, I
[41:48] don't think so. Just had really bad
[41:50] heartburn once." And that probably might
[41:51] have been a heart attack because they
[41:53] can look at the heart and they can see
[41:55] scarring on the heart and the scarring
[41:59] on the heart can decrease the power the
[42:01] muscular power of the heart. And with
[42:03] enough scarring, it could eventually
[42:04] lead to heart failure
[42:06] because every time there's an attack,
[42:08] there's a scarring.
[42:11] And if we look at the human body in a
[42:13] way that we realize that a cut on the
[42:15] skin it can heal back and there's a
[42:16] little bit of scar or tissue there that
[42:18] the scar tissue is not the same in
[42:20] functionality and feeling and everything
[42:22] else as the original skin. Say if the
[42:24] body cannot repair itself or rebuild the
[42:26] tissue exactly as it was. What about the
[42:29] chambers of our hearts?
[42:32] In other words, these bad experiences
[42:34] could leave marks that impair our
[42:36] functionality.
[42:38] There's things that brother Random says
[42:40] are using this example inside the human
[42:42] heart. There are many little doors that
[42:44] cover up a lot of things. What kind of
[42:46] things are hiding behind those doors?
[42:50] Bad experiences can live in our spirits
[42:52] as complexes.
[42:54] Shadows is another word that is used
[42:55] that I think is very very applicable.
[42:58] Shadows in our spirits and these
[43:00] complexes and shadows behind these
[43:02] doors. So, it's almost if as if we have
[43:05] all these doors in our hearts that are
[43:06] shut off and then when something walks
[43:08] by or something passes by, there's a
[43:10] voice from behind other side of the door
[43:12] says, "That looks really scary, Aaron."
[43:16] And something knocks. Nope. Uh-uh. Fool
[43:18] me once, shame on you. We have a saying
[43:20] in Texas, fool me once, can't fool me
[43:21] again. Right? And we kind of push back
[43:24] because there's things in those chambers
[43:27] in these in these other places that
[43:29] these doors are covering up. And so this
[43:34] might seem to be like a really hard turn
[43:36] here,
[43:38] but in looking at the complexes caused
[43:41] from love's wounds, this is the example
[43:43] that God just kept pressing on my heart
[43:45] to use. And I I just accept that this is
[43:48] going to be incredibly relevant, if not
[43:50] to all of us, but even more so to
[43:52] somebody that's going to it's going to
[43:54] penetrate so deeply that God's going to
[43:55] give a great victory in this. But I want
[43:57] to use brother Brandham as an example. I
[43:59] feel like we're doing good on time. I
[44:01] feel like we're good do doing good in
[44:02] atmosphere. It's transition more to
[44:04] spring instead of winter in terms of the
[44:05] the temperature in here and and so I
[44:08] think we're all doing really really good
[44:10] but I want to use the example of brother
[44:11] Brandham and I just have I just been
[44:14] studying this so I have a lot in my
[44:16] heart that I could just express but I
[44:18] think no matter where I start we're
[44:19] seasoned message believers will know
[44:20] where I'm coming from. You know that
[44:22] brother Brandham as a young child had a
[44:24] voice speak to him in a whirlwind in a
[44:27] very supernatural experience. Don't
[44:28] smoke or drink or defile your body in
[44:31] any way.
[44:32] And that spoke to staying clean from
[44:34] smoking and drinking and even um keeping
[44:36] himself sexually pure. We recognize as
[44:38] he tells the story in different ways
[44:40] that it's there was a clear a clear
[44:42] emphasis in that particular part. So
[44:44] this is as a young boy he's confronted
[44:47] with this. Don't smoke, drink, or defile
[44:50] your body in any way. And think about
[44:52] what he was around
[44:53] right
[44:54] his father was a bootleger. tells a lot
[44:57] of stories that kind of signal the kind
[44:58] of women that were hanging around and
[45:00] the men and and the things that the
[45:01] mixed mixing and the adultery and the
[45:03] fornication, the kind of things that he
[45:05] witnessed. He's he's he's witnessing
[45:07] perversion and things that are illegal
[45:08] and the depravity of humanity. Brother's
[45:11] witnessing this as a young kid and this
[45:13] would be a shock to any young boy, but
[45:15] then he also has this kind of gift and
[45:17] this nature and he's been told don't
[45:18] smoke or drink or defile your body in
[45:20] any way. And that's all he ever sees.
[45:22] That's good.
[45:22] That's what he sees his dad doing, his
[45:24] friends doing. All these women, and all
[45:25] these people are doing these different
[45:26] things. And then as a young boy, he is
[45:29] building up a hatred for these things.
[45:32] And he doesn't agree with these things.
[45:34] But now he's picked on and rejected as a
[45:36] bootleggers boy.
[45:38] And he witnesses great immorality,
[45:40] exposed to so much evil. And this is a
[45:43] statement brother Brown makes about
[45:45] himself. People call me today a woman
[45:46] hater. The reason is because I saw so
[45:50] much immorality out of women when I was
[45:52] a kid. I hated them.
[45:56] We're talking about how that there are
[45:59] these complexes
[46:02] that we have and these fears that we
[46:05] have and all the complex is caused by
[46:07] complicated love. And now this may not
[46:10] be in the context of a loving
[46:11] relationship, but just think of a tender
[46:13] child who he's being honest that they
[46:15] call me a woman hater. And now he's just
[46:18] being honest.
[46:20] And he says, "I saw so much immorality
[46:21] out of women when I was a kid. I hated
[46:23] them." He says, "And I don't do that now
[46:25] because I know there are some good
[46:26] ones."
[46:28] Now, that's uh that's one way of putting
[46:31] it, right? I don't hate all women, but
[46:34] he's just saying that I had such a
[46:35] hatred because I thought I thought that
[46:37] was all that a woman was. But now that
[46:39] I've seen the good, I don't hate women
[46:40] anymore because I know that's not how
[46:42] all women are. And we know that brother
[46:44] Bram had an experience that was very uh
[46:48] significant to him because he includes
[46:50] it I think almost every time he tells
[46:51] his life story and how that he says he
[46:54] loved a girl and he had a girl that he
[46:56] thought he was the prettiest thing and
[46:57] had these feelings for her and maybe for
[46:59] a boy that had been rejected and and one
[47:02] he signed feel I got friends and I've
[47:03] got this girl that I like and she's
[47:04] pretty and he thought he loved a girl
[47:06] and he walked up on her and I'm kind of
[47:07] just paraphrasing the story but he
[47:09] walked up on her and caught her smoking
[47:10] a cigarette and I think maybe she
[47:12] offered him smoke and he's like, "No,
[47:14] I'm not going to do that." Was mocked
[47:15] and made fun of. And you when he tells
[47:17] the story, you realize how much that
[47:19] crushed him
[47:20] because not only is he under this
[47:22] commandment, don't smoke or drink or
[47:23] defile your body in any way. Now this is
[47:26] a girl that he loved a and now he's
[47:28] ridiculed and mocked and he realizes,
[47:30] man, I this these are causing so many
[47:32] things in his heart and in his life and
[47:34] he's building up a complex. And he say
[47:37] now he says this about he says this he
[47:42] makes this statement and I realize now I
[47:44] thought I'd put more of the statement
[47:45] here but he says I used to say and I
[47:48] wish I had what it the the the the prior
[47:51] comment to this but it's in quotes
[47:52] they're not worth the good clean bullet
[47:54] to kill them with
[47:56] and and and I say this is a hard saying
[48:00] and it's not one I I I'll I'll just say
[48:03] this for myself. I would never want to
[48:04] preach that as a present day truth
[48:07] because brother Brandham himself
[48:09] qualifies it saying that's what I I used
[48:11] to say. He used to say I used to say
[48:13] that they're not worth the good clean
[48:15] bullet to kill them with it. He saw a
[48:17] woman that would smoke and these immoral
[48:18] women. He said that's right and I hated
[48:21] women. He says and I just have to watch
[48:23] every move now to keep from still
[48:25] thinking the same thing. So this is some
[48:28] honesty. I appreciate the honesty to
[48:30] where he's saying, you know what, I I
[48:31] built up such a place where with women
[48:33] were so immoral and a woman smoking and
[48:36] think about what that would do to
[48:37] somebody. I believe that he he loved his
[48:39] mom and his mom was a good woman. But
[48:41] then he sees all these other women. He
[48:43] sees his dad. He sees all this
[48:44] fornication, all this debauchery. And
[48:46] then he has a supernatural angel tell
[48:47] him, "Don't you ever smoke or drink?"
[48:50] And he sees all these women and defile
[48:52] your body. He sees all the sex and all
[48:53] the drugs and all the things are taking
[48:55] place. And and he's horrified by it. He
[48:58] sees it different. He perceives it
[48:59] differently. And so when he sees a
[49:01] woman, he's thinking, "Oh, he he's just
[49:03] built this up in says, "She's not worth
[49:05] a bullet to shoot her with." My that is
[49:07] shocking,
[49:09] right? That that is a shocking
[49:10] statement. But he says, "I have to watch
[49:13] every move now to keep from saying the
[49:14] same thing." That's honesty.
[49:16] He's not saying, "And you know what?
[49:18] Bless God. I'm going to go ahead and say
[49:19] it again. I I'm going to go ahead and
[49:21] just and just repeat it. I'm going to go
[49:23] ahead and say, thus sayith the Lord."
[49:24] He's not he's not affirming it. He's not
[49:26] doubling down on it. He said, "You know
[49:28] what? I'm being honest. I have to be
[49:30] careful
[49:33] that I don't still still think that
[49:35] way."
[49:36] And we know that God dealt with him very
[49:38] deeply in these areas.
[49:41] And this was a perception that he had to
[49:43] overcome. The Holy Spirit, we know the
[49:45] Holy Spirit dealt with his attitude to
[49:47] begin to develop
[49:49] that harshness, the Ricky and Rquettas,
[49:52] losing his feeling for the people. God
[49:54] showed him the kind of man that he would
[49:56] become if he didn't soften his heart.
[50:00] And so God had to deal with his this
[50:02] perception. And he even says this in one
[50:04] place, I never did like women, but not
[50:06] you sisters. He told me not to defile
[50:09] myself. Let me read it. I never did like
[50:11] women, but not you sisters. I mean, he
[50:14] told me not to defile myself. Notice how
[50:16] he put that together.
[50:18] And he says, and it made me have a
[50:20] complex. See, there's a reason why I use
[50:23] this.
[50:24] He's honest that the things he
[50:26] experienced and the things he was told
[50:28] and commanded, he says, "I built up a
[50:31] complex." I'm just using my words now.
[50:34] He built up a complex against women.
[50:38] And so, as he built this up, maybe it's
[50:40] like, well, I I don't ever want to be
[50:42] defiled. I don't want to ever be
[50:43] intimate. I don't ever want to defile
[50:44] myself. I I I got to avoid that. I got
[50:46] to stay away from that. Oh, I see these
[50:47] women are impure. I just God helped me
[50:49] to express this. But as a young boy
[50:51] around immoral women, I wondered just
[50:53] how much he had to put up with.
[50:55] Right. That's good.
[50:56] Are you following me?
[50:57] Yes, sir.
[50:58] And what that could do to a young boy.
[51:00] Right.
[51:01] The way he's treated, the way he's
[51:02] talked to, the way he's put into
[51:04] different situations, what kind of
[51:06] horrors, what kind of thoughts, what
[51:08] kind of feelings, what kind of scars may
[51:10] de be developing within a young man.
[51:13] And he's and he doesn't always come
[51:15] right out and say these things, but he's
[51:17] saying enough that I hated women because
[51:19] of what I saw. And I used to feel a
[51:22] certain way and I got to watch myself in
[51:23] every move so I don't start having the
[51:25] same thoughts again. And he says, I
[51:27] never did like women because I had this
[51:29] told not to defile myself. I saw so much
[51:31] immorality and it made me have a
[51:33] complex.
[51:35] Yes, sir.
[51:35] Oh, I hope that you're hearing what I'm
[51:37] trying to express tonight.
[51:39] Brother B is being honest
[51:42] of how these wounds created a complex
[51:44] within him
[51:46] and a complex if I could describe it
[51:48] using maybe some of the terms that are
[51:50] used by uh within academia it's a knot
[51:53] within our unconscience
[51:55] and it's these a knot of unconscious
[51:57] feelings and beliefs that they use to
[52:00] describe unexplainable behavior like
[52:03] well that's that's odd or well not
[52:06] everybody kind of usually feels that way
[52:08] or that's that's maybe pattern interrupt
[52:10] of what you would expect. And so what
[52:11] they realize is there's these knot of
[52:13] unconscious feelings that influence the
[52:15] way a person acts. And brother Brandham
[52:17] is saying, I had this knot. These are my
[52:19] words. And and so if you you qualify it
[52:21] in your own understanding, I have this
[52:23] knot of feelings that uh changed my
[52:28] perception towards women or shaped my
[52:29] perception towards women and influenced
[52:31] the way that I acted. Right?
[52:33] A complex is a system of interrelated
[52:36] emotionally charged ideas, feelings, and
[52:38] memories and impulses. So, it's called a
[52:41] complex
[52:43] because there's it's a system. You say,
[52:46] "Well, I have I have an inferiority
[52:49] complex. I I'm using this as an example.
[52:51] I'm not confessing tonight."
[52:54] Then it's not just as the result of
[52:56] being short or as the result of maybe
[52:59] losing out on something, but it's a
[53:01] system of related. They're interrelated
[53:03] and intertwined. In other words, it's
[53:05] it's a complex thing. And I don't know
[53:07] if you recognize what I did with the
[53:08] title there, complex is caused by
[53:10] complicated love. But these are things
[53:12] that are very complicated and complex
[53:14] when it comes to the way people think
[53:15] and way they feel. So it's all these
[53:17] interrelated emotions and beliefs and
[53:19] memories and impulses that are usually
[53:21] repressed,
[53:22] right? And it gives ride to abnormal or
[53:26] pathological behavior.
[53:28] So we have these feelings and we repress
[53:30] them. We have these beliefs and we have
[53:31] these interrelated things and they build
[53:33] up as a complex and they say and it made
[53:36] me have a complex. All these different
[53:37] things start building. It becomes this
[53:39] little knot within our emotions. They
[53:40] say it's a group of mental factors that
[53:42] are unconsciously associated by the
[53:44] individual with the particular subject.
[53:46] We use brother as an example. This was
[53:48] towards women. But now I'm wanting us to
[53:50] think about it in terms of God's love
[53:51] for us. our love for others or even the
[53:54] love that we receive from others. How
[53:55] that there's a complex that builds. He
[53:57] says that influence the individual's
[53:58] attitude and behavior.
[54:01] They call them shadows.
[54:04] Dark unconscious snags
[54:07] that hinder and block our best
[54:09] intentions.
[54:11] I would love I would I I would love to
[54:14] be able to say this, but a complex will
[54:16] keep you from saying it.
[54:18] I would like to be free to do that. I I
[54:20] would like to be able to do this. I I
[54:22] would like to enjoy that. And there's
[54:24] things I know that we all uh there's
[54:26] times in lives where people can rejoice
[54:29] in something and you find it very hard
[54:30] to rejoice in it because of a complex
[54:34] because of a hurt or some feeling or
[54:36] it's someone says, "Oh, well, aren't
[54:38] aren't you so excited so bought a
[54:40] house?" And you know what? You know
[54:41] that's the house that you thought you
[54:42] were going to buy until you showed them
[54:44] and they went and bought it out from
[54:45] underneath you and you're not really all
[54:47] excited about going to the house
[54:48] warming,
[54:50] right?
[54:51] And not everybody knows why you're not,
[54:53] you know, all woohoo, that's a great
[54:55] house. Why? Because you've got feelings
[54:57] you're trying to overcome.
[55:00] And there's things that you experience
[55:02] and you go through and it creates it'll
[55:04] block even your best intentions. And I'm
[55:07] I'm using all this in the context of
[55:09] understanding God's perfect love because
[55:10] I believe that we should not disregard
[55:12] just how deeply these shadows, scars,
[55:14] and complexes
[55:16] influence our love
[55:18] or these complexes about love influence
[55:22] us.
[55:24] These complexes complicate our
[55:27] relationship with God's love
[55:30] and therefore with others.
[55:32] Even if we were to take kind of the the
[55:34] image of God out of this and
[55:37] if this wasn't teach Christian teaching
[55:39] and we were just dealing with an
[55:40] individual in terms of human
[55:41] relationships, we would realize that
[55:44] complexes complicate our relationship
[55:46] with others.
[55:48] Complexes can cause resentment for ones
[55:50] we love. Complexes can cause us to fear
[55:53] ones that love us. Right?
[55:56] I don't know why it's getting so quiet.
[56:00] I've been on this subject now for at
[56:01] least an hour. And all of a sudden I was
[56:03] like, "Wait a minute. What's he that's
[56:04] what he's talking about?
[56:09] They can cause. It's the complex. It's
[56:12] the snag. It's the shadow. It's the
[56:14] scar. It's not the heart. It's not the
[56:16] love. It's the It's the other thing."
[56:19] and we fear the very ones that we love
[56:22] or we resent and mistreat the very that
[56:24] we fear the very ones that love us or we
[56:26] mistreat and resent the ones that we
[56:28] love.
[56:30] Now I want to close. So let's look at
[56:32] our parable in Luke chapter 15.
[56:36] He says a certain man had two sons.
[56:40] The younger of the two took his
[56:42] inheritance and quickly spoiled it
[56:46] and in the state of starvation
[56:50] and being destitute
[56:53] being rejected by all his so-called
[56:55] friends and being a slave in a foreign
[56:58] country when he comes to himself
[57:02] if we could just read verses 18 and 19
[57:06] he has this thought of I will arise and
[57:08] go to my father and will say unto him,
[57:09] "Father, I have sinned against heaven
[57:12] and before thee,
[57:14] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[57:16] son. Make me as one of thy hired
[57:19] servants."
[57:21] Now, one thing that has really stood out
[57:23] to me more and more as I in this story
[57:26] is the humility that the son is
[57:28] expressing at this moment. He He's very
[57:31] self-aware. I've wasted it. I've blown
[57:33] it. So, there's no pretense. There's no
[57:36] uh uh arrogance. you know, I I have a
[57:39] right. I'm entitled. You know, I'm a
[57:41] son. My dad will just take me back. But
[57:43] there's a humility about what he's done.
[57:45] There's an awareness about what he's
[57:47] done. And then there's also this
[57:48] humility to kind of accept the
[57:49] consequences for it. That I've messed
[57:52] up. I've not only sinned against my
[57:53] father, I've sinned against heaven. And
[57:55] because of what I've done, um I I should
[57:58] be treated like a slave because I don't
[57:59] have any inheritance. I've already
[58:00] wasted and I shouldn't have any special
[58:02] place. And so the he has this humility
[58:05] to acknowledge what he's done, but then
[58:06] also he's it implies this humility to
[58:09] accept the consequences. And guess what?
[58:11] His resolve is still true when he meets
[58:13] his father.
[58:14] Right?
[58:15] He says exactly what he said he would
[58:17] say. But I want to focus for a moment on
[58:20] the son's expectation
[58:24] and how the son had the anticipation of
[58:26] deserved punishment. He expected to be
[58:29] rejected.
[58:30] He expected to be shamed. and we could
[58:33] say maybe rightfully so. He expected to
[58:36] be refused. So, as a way of kind of um
[58:41] buffer, you know, protecting himself
[58:43] against the rejection, instead of coming
[58:45] back hat and saying, "Do you think it'd
[58:47] be all right if I had my room back? And
[58:49] is it possible I could be your son
[58:50] again?" He's preparing himself for the
[58:52] worst.
[58:54] And he says, "Just treat me as a
[58:55] servant. Just treat me as a as one who
[58:57] has wasted everything." And he and he's
[58:59] expecting to be refused.
[59:02] And so he's considering an approach that
[59:05] might gain him some mercy and at least
[59:07] allow him to be a servant and as a
[59:09] servant at least have a roof over his
[59:10] head and some provision.
[59:12] And I would say that the way that the
[59:14] son was acting in this moment is
[59:16] consistent with the way that we conduct
[59:17] ourselves towards others or maybe more
[59:20] relevantly worse how we view God's love.
[59:25] That when we make a mistake, we more
[59:27] anticipate that I'm going to be shamed.
[59:28] I'm going to be rejected. I'm going to
[59:30] be abused. I'm going to be I I I'm going
[59:32] to be mistreated. I'm going to suffer
[59:33] terrible loss for what I've done and I'm
[59:36] going to be treated severely and I'm
[59:37] going to be treated harshly and I'm
[59:39] going to lose some sort of privilege.
[59:40] And we kind of get it in our minds that
[59:42] yeah, I I've made a mistake. Therefore,
[59:45] my value and my worth as a son is what
[59:48] suffers in not my character being
[59:50] corrected.
[59:52] In other words, we're more fearful of
[59:53] loss of relationship and privilege that
[59:55] we might have in terms of the love we
[59:56] share with the the person in authority.
[59:58] And I think the son's behavior here, I'm
[1:00:00] so glad that Jesus uses this parable
[1:00:03] because he touches on kind of this
[1:00:04] instinct we have as somebody when we
[1:00:06] make a mistake. Yep, I got it coming.
[1:00:10] And not only do I have it coming, but
[1:00:12] I'm going to get it and I'm going to get
[1:00:13] it bad. And I think this is consistent
[1:00:15] in how we view sometimes what we expect
[1:00:17] from others. Maybe it's consistent in
[1:00:19] how we treat others,
[1:00:21] but worse, it's consistent with how we
[1:00:23] view God's love.
[1:00:28] And brother Bannon makes this tells this
[1:00:30] story.
[1:00:32] I just I feel that the Holy Spirit is
[1:00:34] just kind of is having to deal with the
[1:00:36] hearts and and
[1:00:38] in the the personal way that it needs
[1:00:40] to. Each each situation is different.
[1:00:43] And so I'm kind I'm here at the end and
[1:00:48] I I just I don't want to I I feel
[1:00:50] pressed not to spend much more time
[1:00:51] amplifying this, but I hope the weight I
[1:00:54] hope it can just sink in what God is
[1:00:56] trying to express so that we can be free
[1:00:59] in our love to God.
[1:01:02] But then how can I love my brother? How
[1:01:04] can I be in a place to lay down my life
[1:01:06] for the brethren? How is it it's all
[1:01:08] these there's what keeps this what
[1:01:10] complicates it is are the complexes,
[1:01:12] right?
[1:01:13] And here this prodigal son was suffering
[1:01:15] from a complex and he expected to be
[1:01:17] treated a certain way by his father and
[1:01:20] maybe that's the way that he would have
[1:01:21] dealt harshly and severely with his own
[1:01:23] son.
[1:01:25] And so brother Brandham tells this story
[1:01:27] and it wasn't so from the beginning and
[1:01:28] I've had multiple multiple quotes that I
[1:01:30] could use and different anecdotal
[1:01:32] examples and experiences that brother
[1:01:34] shares. I think they're very relevant to
[1:01:35] this. But he's talking about a um
[1:01:40] a brother Fandler and he and he so when
[1:01:43] he says we were together he's talking
[1:01:45] about brother Fandler not long ago we
[1:01:46] were going together across the country
[1:01:48] and he said to me brother Brandham you
[1:01:49] know my wife don't believe in this and
[1:01:52] said every night when I go to church and
[1:01:54] come home oh she just starts balling me
[1:01:56] out when I hit the door.
[1:01:59] All right, you ready? You can you just
[1:02:01] imagine this for a moment? Comes home
[1:02:03] from church and she just starts balling
[1:02:05] him out. So this wife just meets him at
[1:02:07] the door. Oh, you went down to those
[1:02:09] those holy rollers. I mean, I don't
[1:02:10] know. I don't know the the the the lady.
[1:02:12] So, and uh I'm fortunate to have a wife
[1:02:15] that believes like I do, so I can't
[1:02:17] dramatize a wife balling me out when I
[1:02:19] come in the door from a church service.
[1:02:21] Uh, but you just could just imagine
[1:02:24] how she just starts laying into him as
[1:02:28] soon as he hits the door. All right. So,
[1:02:30] if go back back up. Oh, let's go to the
[1:02:32] other other slide. We're going too far.
[1:02:35] You're going to give me a complex. No,
[1:02:36] go back. Go back. There we go. Now, are
[1:02:39] you are you here?
[1:02:40] Just come home from church, right? Just
[1:02:43] been in the the in the truth and makes
[1:02:45] it almost sound like he's come home from
[1:02:46] the brother Bram's meetings and
[1:02:47] everything. And he comes and he comes in
[1:02:49] and and all of a sudden he says, "Boom."
[1:02:51] The wife just meets him. I can't believe
[1:02:53] you did this.
[1:02:55] And so now watch what the husband does.
[1:02:57] I get her by the hand. She's little. And
[1:03:00] I hold her and I try to cast that devil
[1:03:03] out as hard as I can.
[1:03:06] Come here, honey. I want No, I'm just
[1:03:07] kidding. There's just Imagine he say
[1:03:10] she's little. So I I don't I don't get
[1:03:12] the feel. And it's just like, oh dear,
[1:03:14] come here. But he say she's little. I'm
[1:03:16] bigger. I grab a hold of her and I say,
[1:03:19] "I cast out the devil just as hard as I
[1:03:22] can." He says, "Remind me of your
[1:03:23] message this morning, sir." So, I think
[1:03:25] he's saying that he kind of got the
[1:03:27] inspiration from what was being
[1:03:28] preached, right? So, like I come here,
[1:03:30] woman. I'm going to cast that devil out
[1:03:31] of you. He says, "I try to cast that
[1:03:33] devil out." And I said, "Devil, you come
[1:03:36] out of my wife. Devil, you come out of
[1:03:38] my wife. Honey, you're possessed with
[1:03:39] the devil. Come out of there, devil."
[1:03:44] Wait, I thought I changed it where it
[1:03:46] wasn't up there, but we're kind of He
[1:03:48] says, "You're possessed with the devil.
[1:03:49] Come out of there, devil." And brother
[1:03:51] Brown's response is, "Oh, that's fine,
[1:03:53] Brother Fandler." But you got it you got
[1:03:56] at it the wrong way.
[1:03:58] Think about I mean, we have to recognize
[1:04:00] that for Brother Fandler, that's kind of
[1:04:02] hard to deal with that, right? I mean,
[1:04:04] couldn't we all agree, right? That that
[1:04:05] that would be a difficult relationship
[1:04:07] to have to deal with. But, Brother B,
[1:04:09] I'm saying uh yeah, I don't Yeah, I
[1:04:13] don't think that's the way you want to
[1:04:14] go about that. I mean, just grabbing
[1:04:17] your wife, get the devil, get the devil
[1:04:18] out of her, and it's going to beat the
[1:04:21] devil out of you, honey. And think that
[1:04:23] she's going to be like, "Thank you."
[1:04:25] You know, it's you've been at that devil
[1:04:27] casting out meeting. Yeah. And you're
[1:04:28] next. Oh, yeah. Please, honey. Right.
[1:04:31] There's already a resentment built up
[1:04:32] there. So, I can just imagine the
[1:04:34] complexes that existed in this
[1:04:36] complicated marriage. And he and he's
[1:04:38] saying, 'Yeah, that's that's fine. He
[1:04:40] says, 'But you go at it the wrong way.'
[1:04:43] And he said, 'Well, how do you do it? In
[1:04:44] other words, brother Bham, how do you
[1:04:46] cast the devil out of your wife?
[1:04:48] How do you how do you deal with that
[1:04:50] whenever it's condescending and and hard
[1:04:53] and tearing you down and beating you up?
[1:04:55] I mean, don't you just put your hands on
[1:04:57] her and and cast the devil out? And he
[1:04:58] says, "You ready?"
[1:05:01] He said, "When you come home, buy her a
[1:05:03] box of candy.
[1:05:06] Give it to her. When you come at the
[1:05:07] door, put your arms around her.
[1:05:11] I said, "That's the way you cast out a
[1:05:13] devil."
[1:05:14] Love cast out fear, doesn't it? Love.
[1:05:19] And
[1:05:22] he has not asked a small thing. Right.
[1:05:26] And and and I think in some ways he
[1:05:28] couldn't have asked a more difficult
[1:05:29] thing
[1:05:31] because in the face in the face of what
[1:05:33] he what and I think the story goes both
[1:05:35] ways. There's probably more to that
[1:05:37] story. I'd like to get Sister Fandler's
[1:05:39] side of the story
[1:05:42] and and that would probably be the real
[1:05:44] doozy.
[1:05:46] But we only got Brother Fandler's side
[1:05:47] of the story. And even if we just looked
[1:05:50] at it from his perspective, trying to do
[1:05:52] his best to serve God, comes home, wife
[1:05:54] doesn't believe like he does, and she
[1:05:56] just starts balling me out when I hit
[1:05:58] the door and his response is, "Well,
[1:06:00] that's nothing but the devil. I've been
[1:06:01] in the presence of God and I've been
[1:06:03] praying for the sick and we've been
[1:06:04] casting out devils and I was bathed with
[1:06:06] perfect love just a moment ago." And I
[1:06:08] come home and now you just start balling
[1:06:10] me out. Get over here, woman. We're
[1:06:12] going to cast the next devil out. And
[1:06:13] maybe it's like a struggle. No, get over
[1:06:15] here. I'm only lay my hands on you.
[1:06:17] Right? little five-fold ministry or
[1:06:19] something and and just what that fight
[1:06:21] is and that would be the instinct,
[1:06:23] right? That that would be the that would
[1:06:25] be the way he thought I needed to deal
[1:06:27] with this. And brother Bam's going the
[1:06:28] complete opposite way. And this would be
[1:06:30] the hardest thing to do is to come home
[1:06:33] and put his arms around his around his
[1:06:35] wife and and do something for her, buy
[1:06:37] her something, give her something when
[1:06:38] she walks in the door. And he says,
[1:06:40] "That's the way to cast out a devil."
[1:06:44] Wow.
[1:06:45] Amen.
[1:06:46] That's a hard saying.
[1:06:49] If we only had the o if the we only had
[1:06:52] the capacity to love that would have
[1:06:54] been like of course brother Brandham
[1:06:56] that's all I ever do right but it's
[1:06:58] everything else.
[1:07:00] And I could just imagine what a
[1:07:02] difficult time this brother would have
[1:07:05] in doing that. He might go well I mean
[1:07:07] after maybe the maybe the devil's an
[1:07:09] okay thing in this instance. Like well
[1:07:11] it'll keep me humble. And who knows the
[1:07:13] things he had to start rationalizing in
[1:07:15] order to humble himself and do what
[1:07:16] brother Brandham said would cast out the
[1:07:18] devil.
[1:07:21] What an example
[1:07:24] of channeling the right emotions.
[1:07:28] And so as this young man was coming back
[1:07:30] to his father
[1:07:33] with this complex about love
[1:07:36] with a certain expectation, I say
[1:07:38] complex and maybe taken some liberty
[1:07:39] there, but with a certain expectation to
[1:07:41] be treated roughly and to be cast away
[1:07:43] as a son,
[1:07:46] says in verse 20, and he rose and came
[1:07:47] to his father, and we know what he is
[1:07:49] expecting. But it says, when his father
[1:07:51] was a great way off, his father saw him
[1:07:53] and had compassion. As a father pityth
[1:07:56] his son, so do I pity you. Father had
[1:07:58] pity. He had compassion. He had a tender
[1:08:01] affection. He had a deep love for his
[1:08:03] son and ran and fell on his neck and
[1:08:05] kissed him. I don't know how far the son
[1:08:08] had to travel. I don't know how bad that
[1:08:12] knot beed to feel in his stomach. I
[1:08:14] don't know how anxious he was in knowing
[1:08:16] that he had to face his father who he
[1:08:18] had defamed and who he had profained an
[1:08:20] inheritance. He's like he's called a
[1:08:22] prodigal. He is a wasteful Right?
[1:08:25] And I don't know how long that dusty
[1:08:27] road was. I don't know how long that
[1:08:29] journey was. I don't know how much it
[1:08:30] had been building in his heart for this
[1:08:32] moment, this confrontation he might
[1:08:34] thought he was going to have with his
[1:08:35] dad. But as he comes, his father acts
[1:08:38] before the son has an opportunity.
[1:08:43] And he has compassion and falls on his
[1:08:46] neck and kisses him. The father's
[1:08:49] reaction was consistent with the
[1:08:51] father's love.
[1:08:53] but inconsistent with the son's
[1:08:55] expectation.
[1:08:57] But it expressed something is even Jesus
[1:08:59] Christ is wanting us to understand in
[1:09:01] the different parables of the lost sheep
[1:09:03] and the lost coin and the lost son. He's
[1:09:05] wanting us to understand something about
[1:09:07] the father's love. It represents the
[1:09:09] father's love for us
[1:09:11] and the love that we aspire to show
[1:09:13] others.
[1:09:15] And we keep reading and we find that the
[1:09:17] father did not he stopped the son. The
[1:09:20] son had that resolve still to say, "Dad,
[1:09:23] I I I blew it.
[1:09:26] I I I just want to be a servant." He
[1:09:27] says, "Are you kidding me? Come on, man.
[1:09:29] We're going to We're going to get a
[1:09:31] fatted calf. We're going to feast. My
[1:09:33] son, which was dead, you're alive." He's
[1:09:34] like, "You're you're not angry with me.
[1:09:36] You're not going to punish me more.
[1:09:38] You're not going to shame me for this.
[1:09:39] You're you're not going to make a public
[1:09:41] example out of me." He's like, "No, no,
[1:09:43] son.
[1:09:45] Let's just go forward."
[1:09:48] The father throws a feast and they're
[1:09:49] celebrating the return of his son
[1:09:52] and the older son hears it and what does
[1:09:55] he do? He resents it.
[1:10:00] We could spend a lot more time but we
[1:10:01] have run out of time.
[1:10:05] The older son
[1:10:07] resents what's taking place. The Bible
[1:10:10] says and he was angry
[1:10:13] and would not go in.
[1:10:16] Think of the complex that's keeping him
[1:10:17] from rejoicing with his brother.
[1:10:20] All all the attitudes he built up
[1:10:21] against his brother. Well, he was he he
[1:10:23] walked away from this and he spoke. He
[1:10:26] did this and he did that and just how
[1:10:28] hard it was for him to rejoice when the
[1:10:30] son returned. Is this not true about
[1:10:32] human emotions?
[1:10:34] What the son is experiencing in this
[1:10:36] moment? How hard it is for him to love
[1:10:38] his son? How hard it is for him to be
[1:10:40] happy for his son? How hard it was for
[1:10:42] him even though he could say, "You know
[1:10:43] what? I can see this is a good thing."
[1:10:45] But it's his complexes that keep him
[1:10:47] from being able to say, "Oh, you're
[1:10:49] back, buddy. You're back."
[1:10:52] And so the father has to go out to him
[1:10:54] and he intreated him.
[1:10:57] And his son begins to say,"I I I never
[1:10:59] did this and I was always doing this."
[1:11:01] And what? Think about the complex
[1:11:04] you're showing him. You You throw a
[1:11:06] party for him. You've never thrown a
[1:11:07] party for me.
[1:11:08] Right.
[1:11:09] The comparing the the the the the
[1:11:12] wrestling in his mind, the complexes,
[1:11:14] because now he's thinking, "This is the
[1:11:15] trouble, son. And does he love him more
[1:11:17] than he loves me? Does he is he going to
[1:11:19] get He's wasted everything. I've I've
[1:11:21] always stood by your side." And notice
[1:11:23] how the father says in verse 31, he said
[1:11:25] him, "Son, thou art ever with me and all
[1:11:28] that I have is thine." The father
[1:11:31] assures him of his love considering
[1:11:34] what? His son's insecurity.
[1:11:37] He's addressing the insecurities of the
[1:11:39] older son that even though he's been a
[1:11:41] good son and even though he's never done
[1:11:42] anything wrong, the fact that this other
[1:11:44] thing happens has built up a complex and
[1:11:46] made him insecure. So the father affirms
[1:11:48] his love and says, "Son, you're always
[1:11:51] with me and all that I have is thine."
[1:11:54] Let's rejoice in the prodal that's come
[1:11:56] home. Don't don't compare. Don't compare
[1:11:59] yourself. Don't don't pit yourself
[1:12:01] against him. Be secure in my love. Oh,
[1:12:04] if we could all come to this place, and
[1:12:06] I think this is especially true for
[1:12:07] gifted people and people who have
[1:12:09] callings and ministries, it's just so
[1:12:11] easy to always begin to compare and to
[1:12:13] compete. Oh, let's just be secure. Let
[1:12:16] could we do this as a church, as a as a
[1:12:18] church family? Oh, God, help me to be
[1:12:20] secure in his love for me so that I'm
[1:12:23] not always comparing and I'm not, well,
[1:12:26] they always get the attention and they
[1:12:27] always get this and this always happens.
[1:12:29] Lord, let me be so secure in your love.
[1:12:31] And I'm so glad that God knows complexes
[1:12:34] that we feel. I'm glad he knows what
[1:12:36] we're going through and he's not afraid
[1:12:38] to come out to us
[1:12:40] and say, "Come on, sir.
[1:12:43] What's the problem? Why aren't you
[1:12:45] entering in? Why aren't you happy? Why
[1:12:46] aren't you rejoicing? Well, they just
[1:12:50] Hey, man. Come over here, you
[1:12:52] knucklehead. Get over here. You're
[1:12:54] always with me. Everything I have is
[1:12:57] thine. What's he God is willing to
[1:12:59] address your sec your insecurities.
[1:13:01] Amen.
[1:13:02] I believe you can trust him.
[1:13:06] And I I hope that God is dealing at
[1:13:08] least giving us knowledge, scriptural
[1:13:10] knowledge of things that complicate love
[1:13:13] or how a complicated love has given us
[1:13:15] complexes either towards God or towards
[1:13:17] one another. And I think there's a lot
[1:13:19] of lot here that to work with, a lot of
[1:13:21] things to consider. And I trust that
[1:13:23] you'll be able to do that.
[1:13:24] Amen. Musicians, if you could come
[1:13:26] tonight, we could stand together.
