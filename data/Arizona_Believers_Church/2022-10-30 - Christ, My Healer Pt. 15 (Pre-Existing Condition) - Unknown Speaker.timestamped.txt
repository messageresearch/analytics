[0:00] unless I should be exalted above measure
[0:02] for the abundance of the revelations
[0:03] there was given to me a thorn in the
[0:06] flesh
[0:07] the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest
[0:10] I should be exalted above measure
[0:12] for this thing I besought the Lord
[0:14] Thrice that it might depart from me
[0:17] and he said unto me my grace is
[0:19] sufficient for thee for my strength
[0:22] is made perfect in weakness
[0:24] most gladly therefore well I rather
[0:26] Glory
[0:27] in my infirmities that the power of
[0:29] Christ May rest upon me amen God bless
[0:33] you you can be seated
[0:38] you could tell
[0:39] um from our title slide that we're
[0:41] continuing on the subject of Christ my
[0:42] healer my title today is pre-existing
[0:45] condition
[0:47] pre-existing condition we might hold off
[0:50] quite a bit before we get to amplifying
[0:52] that thought very quickly or tying it in
[0:54] but I'm sure you can already begin to
[0:56] make some connections are tie into that
[0:59] idea of pre-existing condition we're
[1:01] going to recap phobia just for a few
[1:03] moments here
[1:04] and um in the last service last Sunday
[1:07] when we ministered on phobia we
[1:09] addressed the power of fear
[1:11] and how that the power of fear can cause
[1:14] sickness it can be the fear itself which
[1:16] is causing the sickness or it can be
[1:18] fear that is actually keeping us from
[1:20] our healing of the sickness and there
[1:21] was a lot of a lot in there that I was
[1:24] actually feeling pulled maybe just to
[1:25] recap and go back over but I think we
[1:28] want it to be a part of what we're
[1:29] ministering on today but just don't want
[1:31] to take the time to go back over a
[1:33] number of those principles so I trust
[1:34] that you're able to make that connection
[1:36] and your heart as the Lord would be able
[1:37] to do that phobia is defined as an
[1:40] extreme or irrational fear of or an
[1:44] aversion to something so it's an extreme
[1:46] or irrational fear or something an
[1:48] extreme or irrational aversion to
[1:50] something or someone or some situation
[1:52] and by that definition alone a phobias
[1:56] contrary to the mental state and to the
[1:59] the emotional state that is promised to
[2:02] the believer because there's some things
[2:04] that even if you just fear a little bit
[2:05] according to the word of God it's
[2:07] irrational it doesn't fit with the
[2:09] rationale of the scripture there's some
[2:11] things that if you fear just even the
[2:13] slightest it's going to be excessive
[2:15] because you're asked and you're told not
[2:16] to fear so in some ways phobia stands
[2:19] against everything that God promises to
[2:22] the believer and one of our the themes
[2:24] we wanted to emphasize is feed your
[2:26] faith starve the phobia or feed your
[2:29] faith starve the fear and that that's a
[2:31] principle that you can apply to any
[2:33] promise of God any kind of situation
[2:34] anything you're facing that you want to
[2:37] always constantly continually be feeding
[2:39] your faith in conscious that there's a
[2:41] lot of things that will feed your phobia
[2:43] the word is the only thing that feeds
[2:45] your faith but there's a lot of things
[2:47] that will feed your phobia and it
[2:49] doesn't have to be that if you're afraid
[2:50] of spiders you read about how bad
[2:52] spiders are you could just be feeding on
[2:55] things that feed the Flesh and weaken
[2:57] your faith and get your mind on other
[2:58] things and that's always going to allow
[3:00] some sort of fear or phobia to thrive
[3:03] and Jesus even mentions it in Luke
[3:06] chapter 21 verse 26 how in the end times
[3:08] men's Hearts will literally be failing
[3:12] men will be expiring not because of an
[3:14] infectious disease but because of fear
[3:16] and so fear is such a tremendous uh
[3:19] debilitating agent upon a person and job
[3:22] even himself says in Job chapter 3 verse
[3:24] 25 for the thing which I greatly feared
[3:27] is come upon me and that which I was
[3:30] afraid of is come to me
[3:32] his fear was bringing it to him his his
[3:36] foreboding his anxiety has had the
[3:39] ability and the power to attract the
[3:41] things that he was afraid of and bring
[3:42] it bring it right to him and so that
[3:45] just emphasizes again just how powerful
[3:48] fear is it can actually cause a man's
[3:50] heart to fail it has power to bring to
[3:52] pass the very things that you are afraid
[3:55] of the thing which I greatly feared has
[3:57] come upon me that which he was afraid of
[3:59] has come unto me we touched on a few
[4:01] different things that I think
[4:03] um it could be relevant to very
[4:05] specifically to some people but also by
[4:07] way of analogy or type it's applicable
[4:09] to all of us but Munchausen Syndrome uh
[4:12] where or even hypochondria where this is
[4:15] fear of being sick or faking an illness
[4:19] and you think oh well they're just
[4:21] pretending to be sick or they're they're
[4:23] afraid of being sick those mental states
[4:26] can actually produce physical phenomena
[4:29] those mental states can actually produce
[4:31] symptoms and they can produce use uh
[4:33] present things in such a way to where
[4:35] even doctors can be examining someone
[4:37] with one of these syndromes or one of
[4:39] these sicknesses and they're going huh
[4:41] this is strange and we can measure this
[4:42] and we can see that and we see this and
[4:44] we see that but unable to ever get to
[4:46] the bottom of what was actually causing
[4:48] it and they realized sometimes it's the
[4:50] person's mental state how worried they
[4:52] are how worked up they are how fearful
[4:54] they are or how much they want to be
[4:56] sick can actually cause the body to be
[4:58] sick that's a powerful principle isn't
[5:00] it and I think it's important to maybe
[5:02] uh uncover that for us as Believers that
[5:05] the power of our thought process can be
[5:07] causing us to present certain symptoms
[5:09] and God is going to say just get in the
[5:11] right mind
[5:12] right and that's going to bring the heal
[5:14] in that you crave
[5:16] and we touched on in terms of the nocebo
[5:18] effect kind of the opposite or the evil
[5:21] twin of the placebo effect but it's a
[5:23] negative outcome because the person
[5:25] believes that harm will come
[5:27] perhaps that's exactly how the
[5:29] scientists would explain
[5:31] um job's luck and say well job was a
[5:33] real person and this did happen to job
[5:34] but we do not believe that God ever made
[5:37] this uh challenge to Satan we just
[5:39] believe that job because he dwelled on
[5:42] it because he thought about it it would
[5:43] be the nocebo effect and when it comes
[5:45] to medicine that if you believe that
[5:47] something is going to have a negative
[5:48] impact it actually does have a negative
[5:50] impact even if there was nothing but
[5:52] sugar in the pill
[5:54] and this is where science comes to this
[5:56] conclusion noceba comes from the Latin
[5:58] to harm that if someone expects that
[6:00] they'll have side effects that someone
[6:01] expects that they're going to get sick
[6:03] if someone begins to think that it's
[6:04] going to be bad or harmful then it
[6:07] actually comes it's a negative outcome
[6:09] because of that thought process
[6:11] now this ties in but this also allows us
[6:14] to take a step further second Timothy
[6:15] chapter 1 verse 7.
[6:18] and and I believe I meant to say this at
[6:20] the outset I believe I'm just coming
[6:21] very very near finishing up this series
[6:24] both on a matter of Faith which has been
[6:26] a kind of a support to this subject of
[6:29] Christ my healer and Lord willing next
[6:31] Sunday morning we can finish up on this
[6:33] uh this portion of the subject of Christ
[6:35] My Healer
[6:36] and it says in second Timothy chapter 1
[6:39] verse 7 for God hath not given us the
[6:42] spirit of fear so we have not received
[6:44] the spirit of fear the Bible tells us
[6:46] that a bondage is a spirit of fear
[6:49] brings bondage and it brings uh uh you
[6:51] could just look at all these other ways
[6:52] it imprisons the per person he has not
[6:55] given us the spirit of fear but and we
[6:57] could say the spirit of power and of
[6:59] love and a sound mind
[7:01] so maybe there's many different ways
[7:03] that a negative Spirit can manifest
[7:05] itself and it can manifest itself in
[7:07] fear or there could be a spirit of fear
[7:09] and it's in that Dimension itself that
[7:11] it can manifest itself in many different
[7:13] ways but the spirit we've received is a
[7:16] spirit of power the spirit we've
[7:18] received is a spirit of love and of a
[7:19] sound mind that self-control it means
[7:22] for one to be in their right senses or
[7:25] have to have one senses restored to them
[7:27] in some places it's it's actually
[7:29] rendered or translated to being sober to
[7:32] have a sound mind you're sober fear fear
[7:35] then is we even take it from that and
[7:37] Paul is bringing this contrast fear put
[7:40] someone in the wrong State of Mind
[7:42] that we mentioned last time how it's
[7:44] intoxicating and that fear because it
[7:46] intoxicates you and influences you it
[7:49] changes your behavior it changes your
[7:50] perception it changes uh the mind and
[7:53] the body it works just like just like
[7:55] alcohol or a drug it's going to
[7:57] intoxicate you put you under the
[7:59] influence and if it was a crime we'd all
[8:01] be guilty
[8:02] right of driving under the influence of
[8:05] fear or going to church under the
[8:06] influence of fear whatever it might be
[8:08] there's a fear puts us in the wrong
[8:10] state of mind so Paul touches on the
[8:13] spirit of power love and a sound mind
[8:17] and and it may be I may not be able to
[8:20] touch on it today but this sound mind is
[8:24] it's one that's sober
[8:27] and it's it's stable and I want to just
[8:30] caution it's not one that's just
[8:32] languishing
[8:33] and kind of resigned that well I just
[8:35] kind of give in uh but it's a it's a
[8:38] it's a mind that's confident and
[8:40] trusting because the way that we can say
[8:41] well you want to be in a sound mind you
[8:43] want to be stable you want to be sober
[8:44] you want to be sane and then we can say
[8:46] well that means I've got to accept this
[8:48] and that means I've got to be this way
[8:49] but it just means to be confident and
[8:51] trusting a stable mind and a sound mind
[8:54] is centered upon Christ it acts
[8:56] prudently it acts uh soberly it acts in
[8:59] moderation it acts in a very balanced
[9:01] way within the parameters of the word of
[9:04] God sometimes we mistake Faith as being
[9:06] extreme
[9:07] and and so we think that the louder we
[9:10] can shout or the harder we can run or
[9:11] the greater the more passionate we could
[9:13] be in doing certain things that that
[9:15] demonstrates a greater Faith but
[9:16] sometimes it's actually demonstrating
[9:18] how unsound you are in your thought
[9:21] process and you're trying to convince
[9:22] yourself
[9:24] and so in a sound mind be insane and
[9:26] sober you can you can praise you can
[9:28] shout You Can Dance you can worship and
[9:30] you can also sit reverently and believe
[9:32] because you're in that balanced Mind of
[9:35] a Christian
[9:37] it acts prudently now Paul kind of
[9:40] throws out I take that back Paul also
[9:43] references power and love and I didn't
[9:45] want to just Breeze over this but he's
[9:47] been given us a spirit of power which
[9:49] drives away the cowardice it drives away
[9:51] the fear it's a spear of power so it has
[9:54] that confidence that it can stand up to
[9:56] anything and it's uh it's the power and
[9:59] and this power
[10:00] and this is uh it's power and the
[10:04] sobriety or the soberness the soundness
[10:06] because in a way you think about those
[10:08] two if someone's very sober we we
[10:11] typically would think that they're not
[10:12] really animated someone's sober they're
[10:15] maybe not somber but it's sober still
[10:17] they're they're not enthusiastic they're
[10:20] very even they're very level and then on
[10:22] their hand is power and soberness in
[10:25] some ways themselves kind of present uh
[10:28] these these different sides of things is
[10:31] that making sense power and soberness
[10:33] and maybe there's worldly's ways that we
[10:35] could describe it to help but the
[10:37] beautiful part is love ties them
[10:38] together
[10:40] giving you a spirit of power and a
[10:42] spirit of soberness but then love is
[10:43] what ties them together because he says
[10:45] I've given you a spirit of love it's a
[10:47] balancing factor between what can be
[10:49] between what can be two extremes of
[10:51] soberness and Power
[10:53] and love is what kind of binds them
[10:55] together and kind of holds them together
[10:57] it's the balancing between a power and
[11:00] enthusiasm and ability and the rationale
[11:03] and the and the soberness because you
[11:05] could be so sober you don't act right
[11:08] or you can be so powerful you don't know
[11:09] when not to act but love is what directs
[11:12] those those Powers it's what directs the
[11:13] power it's what directs the the
[11:15] soberness and so with the spirit of love
[11:17] it keeps you in that balance
[11:21] a lot there to chew on
[11:23] now if we are sick and this is I'm gonna
[11:25] this is where I'm starting this is where
[11:27] I'm going to end today if we are sick we
[11:30] do not need to fear anything
[11:33] I can actually just say we do not need
[11:34] to fear anything right but in Light of
[11:36] Christ my healer when we are sick
[11:38] there's nothing about the sickness or in
[11:41] the sickness that we need to fear he
[11:43] said well brother Aaron I'm worried well
[11:44] your worries can be justified in the
[11:46] sense of rational and that makes sense
[11:48] any kind of human being would be worried
[11:50] about that or I'm very anxious about
[11:51] this pain or I'm worried about this and
[11:53] we're that's fine but as we put it in
[11:55] this context of fear and worry in this
[11:57] foreboding and the doubting with if
[11:59] you're sick you have nothing to fear
[12:01] nothing in the sickness to fear nothing
[12:03] in the future to fear and nothing in the
[12:05] treatment or the process to fear
[12:08] whatever it is we have there's nothing
[12:10] to fear in seeking help there's nothing
[12:12] to fear in the future there's nothing to
[12:13] fear in the sickness we have to have
[12:15] this mindset as Believers no matter how
[12:18] tremendous it may be how hurtful it may
[12:20] be no matter what the outcome may be I
[12:22] cannot give myself over to a spirit of
[12:25] fear
[12:26] and my I tell you what it's so easy for
[12:29] me to say that
[12:31] I could keep saying it it's that easy
[12:34] and the more I say it the more you might
[12:36] want to come up here and put my your
[12:38] hand over my mouth say easy
[12:40] right so easy to say it very very
[12:43] difficult to live it
[12:46] so if that's the case then faith and
[12:48] this has been kind of my personal
[12:50] guiding thesis faith has to be at the
[12:53] center of our Behavior
[12:55] it has to be the guiding force of our
[12:57] actions if it's not Faith that's guiding
[12:59] our actions whether to do something or
[13:01] not to do something if it's not Faith
[13:04] then we can freeze and not do anything
[13:06] at all
[13:07] or we can fight even to our harm
[13:10] that if it's fear we might go oh I'm
[13:12] paralyzed I don't know what to do I
[13:14] can't do anything I'm not going to do
[13:15] anything I'm just going to believe oh
[13:18] is that fear talking or faith
[13:21] or you you're just I'm gonna do
[13:23] everything maybe it's even that power
[13:24] I'm going to do everything I'm gonna do
[13:25] this I'm gonna do that I'm going to do
[13:26] this I'm gonna do it but is it is it
[13:28] balanced by love
[13:29] is it balanced by that soberness and
[13:31] that's and that sobriety is it really
[13:33] faith that is functioning uh to bring a
[13:36] person to that place of confidence that
[13:38] what they're not doing or what they are
[13:39] doing is something from the Lord
[13:43] we read this on Wednesday night
[13:46] and keep coming Juniper she's right here
[13:48] there you go
[13:49] see we just have such a close family
[13:53] the sermon I Jesus Christ the same
[13:55] yesterday today and forever and we
[13:57] touched on this Wednesday night and I'm
[13:58] wanting to pick back up where we were
[13:59] Wednesday night uh again this coming
[14:02] Wednesday but this is it just flows it
[14:04] just been flowing right through brother
[14:05] Brown says in this you see so much when
[14:07] you speak of bodily healing you see a
[14:09] lot when you talk about healing Divine
[14:10] Healing bodily healing healing of the
[14:12] body you see so much and he says there's
[14:14] the motives and objectives that people
[14:16] seem to be so confused and wrong many
[14:19] times
[14:20] now when brother bam talks about that he
[14:22] talks about it from the scientific
[14:24] standpoint the medical standpoint from
[14:26] from the doctor and then from the
[14:28] chiropractor and the osteopath and and
[14:30] then from the unbeliever and everyone
[14:32] has a take right
[14:35] everyone has a take it's like that
[14:36] saying everyone opinions are like noses
[14:39] right everybody has one and mine's just
[14:41] bigger than yours
[14:43] and and so it's it's it's when he talks
[14:46] about it it's kind of all of us even as
[14:48] Believers we can put in this state of
[14:50] well you know what about this and what
[14:53] about that the motives and objectives
[14:54] seem to be so confused and wrong many
[14:56] times and that goes for all of us
[14:59] very easy for even those of us who are
[15:02] looking at Divine Healing not being sick
[15:04] we can have a lot of motives and
[15:06] objectives or ideas and opinions that
[15:07] are confused and wrong we who are sick
[15:09] and desire and healing can have a lot of
[15:11] opinions and ideas and be confused and
[15:13] so wrong and then every in the people
[15:15] who are practicing medicine people who
[15:17] believe that it's a sin you have all
[15:19] these different ideas and people because
[15:20] can be so confused and wrong many times
[15:24] and I believe it's the word that gives
[15:26] us the balance
[15:28] and we want to continue as we I believe
[15:29] we tried to do last week is expose all
[15:32] the shadows and complexes that keep us
[15:34] from our healing
[15:36] and and what we're really looking at
[15:37] when we talked about phobia and what
[15:39] we're talking about today is the fear
[15:41] suspicion doubt even just to hesitate a
[15:45] little bit
[15:46] and and and hesitation's not wrong if
[15:48] it's if you're being checked by your
[15:50] faith
[15:52] and I know there's just a lot to it and
[15:54] just recognizing the will of God
[15:56] and how do we pray for the will of God
[15:57] what does the will of God look like
[15:58] there's a lot of things that we can
[16:00] challenge ourselves with not just when
[16:02] it relates to our healing but daily
[16:03] decisions and really I think it's so
[16:06] beautiful that we have that God has
[16:08] arranged it in such a way toward the end
[16:10] of the day you as an individual are
[16:12] going to find that your faith is going
[16:13] to grow through those challenges
[16:16] because it's not like you can uh you can
[16:18] take a test and then just kind of flip
[16:21] to the back and check the answers right
[16:23] and be like
[16:24] oh okay that's what it is
[16:26] that we we learn as we grow and we'll do
[16:29] things and we'll learn that wasn't faith
[16:32] and and we learn in that process so that
[16:35] at the end of the day it's not because
[16:36] we have the answers printed out
[16:38] necessarily but because we have that
[16:40] Faith deep down in this inside of our
[16:42] hearts and that becomes the anchor for
[16:45] everything that we think say and do
[16:47] and not Church rules and not just a
[16:49] pastor telling us what to do and and not
[16:52] even just because the message has so
[16:53] much from 47 to 65 but at the end of the
[16:56] day it's it's Faith that's the guiding
[16:58] force that keeps us in the will of God
[17:00] and so we have to look at fear suspicion
[17:03] doubt and all those things that try to
[17:05] hinder our faith
[17:07] now in the sermon what it takes to
[17:08] overcome all belief all unbelief and the
[17:10] answer is our faith so faith is what
[17:12] overcomes all unbelief listen to this
[17:15] principle I think this is such a
[17:16] beautiful principle and
[17:19] the the the the number of things that
[17:21] have been upon my heart I just I was
[17:24] really just waiting on the Lord just to
[17:26] figure out as we've gone through this
[17:27] there's some things that kind of drop to
[17:29] the side another thing that kind of
[17:30] drops the side and I find myself feeling
[17:33] that I'm very very near the end and
[17:34] maybe I have a collection of little
[17:36] principles that I think could be
[17:37] deposited into our heart that could help
[17:39] us and it just waited on the Lord just
[17:41] to put it together in a picture that
[17:43] could help all of us and so if there if
[17:46] some of you sense that some of these
[17:47] things seem to be maybe just a little
[17:49] subset if it helps you just take it
[17:52] if it doesn't seem to fit cohesively
[17:54] into the hole I'll take the blame for
[17:56] that it says what about when you submit
[17:58] yourself to the doctor
[18:00] when a doctor comes and he says he has
[18:02] some medicine for you and you take the
[18:04] medicine and you say now
[18:06] there's no there's no negativity that's
[18:08] implied in this submitting yourself to
[18:10] the doctor but now when they go to give
[18:11] you medicine this is where he begins to
[18:14] challenge our thought process he says
[18:15] will you submit yourself to the doctor
[18:17] and the doctor says here's some medicine
[18:18] and he's doing this to make a point
[18:20] about a spiritual point but he says this
[18:23] is your this is what you say now doctor
[18:25] sit down here and you tell me what's in
[18:27] what's all in this pill I want the
[18:30] mechanics of it what's all the analysis
[18:32] of this pill what kind of a medical
[18:34] formula have you got mixed up here for
[18:36] me how did you get this strychnine how
[18:38] did they do how was that made what did
[18:40] it come from and who found it and where
[18:42] did this glycerin come from and where
[18:44] did all this other stuff that goes into
[18:45] this formula
[18:47] come on right
[18:49] that's exactly what we do
[18:51] now right that's exactly what we do
[18:54] we're already Googling it before the
[18:55] doctor has a chance yeah what was that
[18:56] again how do you spell that
[19:00] well my chiropractor says right
[19:04] and immediately we want to know what lab
[19:05] it was produced in Wuhan right and we're
[19:09] we're already very very curious about
[19:10] who made it where it came from and and
[19:13] especially what you'll notice just bear
[19:15] with me here
[19:17] that when it's coming from a particular
[19:18] place you do all the research you want
[19:21] right
[19:22] but then when Dr Oz says it's boom there
[19:26] you go right there Rush Limbaugh said
[19:27] right just whatever said on this one you
[19:29] don't even you don't even dig any
[19:31] further I'm just saying right come on
[19:33] put your shoes back on don't don't throw
[19:36] anything at me
[19:38] but it's just the way that we think
[19:39] sometimes I believe he's identifying
[19:41] this process we have in the day and age
[19:44] that we're living and when data and
[19:45] information and Analysis is all at our
[19:47] fingertips we can satiate that itch to
[19:50] want to know more where did it come from
[19:51] what does it do how does it work and if
[19:53] you think I'm throwing off on anybody
[19:55] here but myself you're wrong because
[19:58] that's how I am
[20:00] I want to research it right and God we
[20:02] trust everyone else bring data
[20:04] thank you brother Carlin all right
[20:06] that's that's the way that's the way I
[20:08] am I want to research it I want it to
[20:09] make sense verify verify verify document
[20:13] document document these are some of the
[20:15] principles and rules that I use in my
[20:17] profession that I that I use when I
[20:19] approach something I want the data and I
[20:21] want to document and I want to verify it
[20:23] and I want to do it in triplicate
[20:25] and so that may sound really really good
[20:27] if I'm trying to research a a Securities
[20:30] problem for one of my clients but if I
[20:32] get like that with everything just think
[20:34] of how paralyzed and defeated we can be
[20:36] and that's why it takes a year and a
[20:38] half to dedicate a baby right
[20:42] that's why sometimes I'll shop for
[20:44] something for five years and by then I
[20:46] don't need anymore
[20:47] because you research you document you
[20:49] run the metrics on the reviews and and
[20:52] yeah it might it might help someone make
[20:54] a decision but there's a downside to
[20:56] this
[20:57] and this downside to being analytical
[20:58] and trying to figure out and what you're
[21:00] doing is now the doctor who's making the
[21:02] recommendation you take away the
[21:05] authority from him and you make yourself
[21:07] the sole judge and you make yourself the
[21:10] Arbiter and the one who's making the
[21:11] decisions and I'm not saying absolutely
[21:13] that you've got to defer all that trust
[21:15] to the doctor but notice that that state
[21:18] that you get in where this is the way
[21:20] you're talking and acting what's in the
[21:21] pill what are the mechanics of it
[21:22] where'd you get this from where'd you
[21:23] get that from where'd you get this from
[21:24] where'd you get that from
[21:27] and brother Bram says he writes in Greek
[21:29] which
[21:31] it looked like it I'm sure
[21:33] he says probably he don't even know what
[21:35] it is know it himself he just writes it
[21:38] out man we could use that on doctors he
[21:40] says all right that's what he's been
[21:41] told to do but the only thing you do you
[21:44] submit yourself to the doctor and take
[21:46] the pills
[21:48] that's all now I'm not trying to make
[21:50] any point by that this is just brother
[21:51] Rana making this observation notice he
[21:53] says and if you trust your doctor
[21:55] chances are it'll help you
[21:58] now there you go that's what I was
[21:59] wanting to lead to is it's I think you
[22:02] believe you could take from this not
[22:04] don't take from this that well you got
[22:06] to go to the doctor and submit yourself
[22:07] to the doctor that wouldn't be the point
[22:08] I'm trying to make but the point that he
[22:10] does make is that if you do go to the
[22:12] doctor and he prescribes something to
[22:13] you and you don't trust him it's
[22:15] probably not going to help you
[22:17] but if you do trust your doctor he says
[22:19] chances are it will help you
[22:22] so notice how what he's kind of
[22:24] identifying is that fear and that
[22:25] suspicion or I can say this way fear
[22:28] suspicion and that doubt is not going to
[22:31] help but what he does say if you trust
[22:33] that confidence that positive attitude
[22:35] he says chances are it will help you
[22:38] what what could we what could we
[22:40] attribute this to or let's just put it
[22:42] this way what would the world attribute
[22:44] it to the placebo effect Maybe
[22:47] that even within the within medicine in
[22:49] the treatment that a person's attitude
[22:51] towards the treatment matters the way a
[22:53] person is thinking that beneficial
[22:55] effect that is produced by a drug or
[22:57] treatment that cannot be attributed to
[23:00] any active agent in the drug they say oh
[23:02] well we don't know why this sugar pill
[23:04] worked it just must be because they
[23:06] believed that it would work
[23:09] not taking issue with the strychnine or
[23:12] the or the glycerin or the pill he's
[23:14] saying that if you trust your doctor he
[23:16] says chances are what he does prescribe
[23:19] you will help
[23:21] remember how Placebo means it's a
[23:23] medicine given to please the Latin
[23:25] meaning to please Placebo the Placer
[23:28] medicine given to please than to benefit
[23:32] it's medicine given to make the patient
[23:34] happy not necessarily do actually
[23:36] benefit the patient
[23:38] now the it can be used a lot in a
[23:40] negative from a negative standpoint oh
[23:42] well the placebo effect the placebo
[23:44] effect
[23:45] and I think that there's a way that it's
[23:47] used and again this has been this has
[23:50] been remarkably balancing for me because
[23:52] the way I think my personal opinions on
[23:55] things the word of God has just balanced
[23:57] me completely
[23:58] and it's been very liberating for me to
[24:00] realize that I can put I can burn my
[24:03] soapbox right I can put up all all my uh
[24:07] weapons that I have trained a lot of
[24:09] different things and realize that that
[24:12] when I use I can use the terminology
[24:14] well that's just a placebo effect
[24:15] there's nothing in that at all it's just
[24:16] a placebo effect well that's because
[24:18] that's how science and Academia and
[24:20] that's how the the doctors and the
[24:22] academics look at it to try to figure
[24:24] out and they can't at the time make any
[24:27] causal connection to what's being done
[24:30] and they go well hey maybe there's just
[24:32] something we don't know that's happening
[24:34] in the patient or in what we've given
[24:36] them
[24:37] and they say it's just one of these
[24:39] things that's attributed to the thought
[24:40] process
[24:41] but that in itself doesn't need to be
[24:44] something that there's no value in
[24:47] so what they're recognizing I'll read it
[24:49] to you this way from the academics
[24:51] experts have concluded that reacting to
[24:54] a placebo is not proof that a certain
[24:57] treatment doesn't work
[24:59] but rather that another
[25:01] non-pharmacological mechanism may be
[25:03] present
[25:05] right think of just how beautiful that
[25:09] is they're saying that well we we can't
[25:12] say this they say that the placebo
[25:13] effect shouldn't be viewed as a failure
[25:16] shouldn't be viewed that something's not
[25:18] working but they're realizing maybe
[25:19] something beyond the medicine something
[25:21] beyond the doctor something beyond the
[25:24] pill is it working a person's life and a
[25:26] person's attitude and it actually is
[25:29] having an impact
[25:31] in some circles this is how that they've
[25:33] looked at it with respect to medicine
[25:35] and there's so many studies on this it
[25:37] actually becomes a little bit dizzying
[25:39] and they call it maybe the lab coat
[25:42] effect or the white lab coat effect at
[25:44] one time when doctors actually wore
[25:46] those that just in presenting that it
[25:48] would give this patient this assurance
[25:50] that somebody who is an expert is going
[25:52] to help me fight this illness this
[25:54] mysterious pain something that's
[25:55] happening that I have somebody on my
[25:58] side somebody who's an advocate who's
[25:59] going to look at this for me from the
[26:01] outside and they're going to be able to
[26:03] tell me what to do and if anything
[26:05] they're going to be there for me right
[26:07] from a professional standpoint to kind
[26:10] of help me in what I'm going through
[26:13] and in a lot of the literature that you
[26:15] read about this and I hope that you
[26:16] don't feel like I'm just going down some
[26:17] Rabbit Trail this will all just kind of
[26:19] come together for you uh by the time we
[26:22] reach the end
[26:23] that they even surmise that at one time
[26:26] given the maladies that people faced and
[26:29] the different techniques and remedies
[26:30] that they had available that the most
[26:32] important thing a doctor gave a patient
[26:34] was that assurance that somebody cared
[26:37] one of the most important things that a
[26:39] doctor represented is that I'm
[26:41] interested in what you're going through
[26:43] and we're going to help you get to the
[26:44] bottom of it and we're going to be there
[26:46] for you and it provided some Solace as
[26:48] from an expert someone who knew who
[26:50] could give you some information and they
[26:52] would look at this way for a long time
[26:53] in some ways doctors hands were tied in
[26:56] terms of how they could treat diseases
[26:58] or certain injuries or certain
[27:00] situations and that was the most
[27:02] important function of the doctor
[27:04] was to be there for the patient
[27:08] someone who cares and shows concerns
[27:10] can help alleviate worry
[27:13] it's it's one that can help alleviate
[27:15] fear
[27:23] and they actually
[27:25] one of the things that I've come across
[27:28] and I think this would be very helpful
[27:30] helpful to recognize this
[27:32] that it's one of the things that
[27:34] alternative remedies have against
[27:35] traditional medicine now or modern
[27:37] medicine
[27:38] is in in cases where you're seeking out
[27:40] something from the the mill right
[27:45] is there people spend more time with you
[27:46] it's more personal right they're looking
[27:50] at things from a bigger picture and that
[27:52] gives you the assurance that they care
[27:55] gives you the feeling that they're
[27:56] Mindful and so this is something that
[27:58] science and the practice of medicine is
[28:00] recognizing on a number of levels and
[28:02] notice how brother Bradham catches on
[28:04] this and he he cares do you
[28:07] brother Branham says and he and I for
[28:09] time's sake I kind of cut this out and
[28:11] and I thought maybe it'd be really good
[28:12] to read but I didn't want maybe didn't
[28:14] want to spill into a debate but remember
[28:15] I'm saying milk used to be one of the
[28:16] most healthy things they could recommend
[28:18] you and now doctors are saying don't
[28:20] drink it right and he's saying this in
[28:23] 1963 and he says this causes sinuses and
[28:25] all sorts of problems and doctors saying
[28:27] don't drink it because it used to be
[28:28] part of a balanced diet but if we've
[28:30] learned anything it's always question
[28:32] what's recommended right like who said
[28:34] you had to spend a month's salary on an
[28:36] engagement ring
[28:37] De Beers right
[28:40] right not the Bears the diamond company
[28:42] right they're the ones that said to do
[28:45] it
[28:46] how can we get guys to Shell out you
[28:49] know a month salary on an engagement
[28:50] ring well let's just put it out there in
[28:53] The Ether and say this is the standard
[28:54] who said you had to eat this sugary
[28:57] cereal for breakfast Kellogg's right
[29:02] who said synthetic sugars are bad right
[29:05] the real sugar Growers
[29:10] and then brother Branham touches on that
[29:11] he says and but then he brother Brandon
[29:13] brings it to the weakness of the person
[29:14] and the hybrid and these weaknesses of
[29:16] inner breed are the foods that we are
[29:17] eating for life
[29:19] are weakening the body which causes
[29:21] cancer mental troubles and all kinds of
[29:23] diseases is said and upon the human body
[29:24] because it's weakness this is dead on
[29:27] this this exactly works today this is
[29:29] exactly what they're recognizing is
[29:31] causing a lot of problems and and the
[29:34] causation of it is more complex than
[29:36] well if you eat sugary foods but just a
[29:38] social economic factors
[29:40] there's a lot of things um that Target
[29:43] and and uh
[29:45] and are detrimental to people who are in
[29:48] certain economic sectors and the diet
[29:51] just it just Cascades and it gets worse
[29:53] and it gets worse and it gets worse and
[29:55] so brother branham's touching on
[29:56] something on such a deep level
[29:59] that the foods are weakening the body
[30:01] causing cancer mental troubles and all
[30:03] kinds of diseases scientific destroy
[30:06] themselves getting away from God's plan
[30:08] and as you recognize the way that
[30:10] brother Brandon is diagnosed in it you
[30:12] realize that the reason why science has
[30:15] gotten so advanced in treating diseases
[30:17] is they've gotten so advanced in causing
[30:19] them
[30:20] right like we've gotten so good at
[30:23] causing all these maladies we had to get
[30:25] really good at addressing them
[30:27] and he says and he said let let every
[30:29] seed bring forth of its kind see where
[30:31] we're at I could go on and on our time's
[30:33] getting away but notice what that's
[30:35] doing science has brought death sickness
[30:38] and destruction and I saw the other day
[30:40] I was talking to my good friend Dr Vale
[30:42] sitting here and that's that where
[30:43] there's an article that people getting
[30:45] killed by penicillin
[30:47] and I it was going to take time maybe to
[30:49] look it up and try to find it I figured
[30:51] it wouldn't be hard to kind of find that
[30:52] localized
[30:54] within that time period he says it
[30:56] really isn't the penicillin it's the
[30:58] filth that they let get in when they're
[31:00] manufacturing the penicillin
[31:03] now that's that's enlightening as to
[31:05] terms of what brother Branham was
[31:07] identifying or even what the article
[31:09] might have said that the penicillin
[31:10] itself is great but there's breakdowns
[31:12] in the manufacturing process that was
[31:14] causing the problem and that might have
[31:15] been what was actually in the penicillin
[31:17] not the penicillin itself but the
[31:19] article may have referenced and maybe
[31:20] there's some conjecture here so I
[31:21] apologize may have referenced that
[31:23] the sloppiness in the manufacturing
[31:25] process allowed certain things to get
[31:27] into the penicillin and that was what
[31:30] was causing people to die not the
[31:31] penicillin itself and then notice what
[31:33] brother Branham brings it to
[31:35] he says it's a money-making greed scheme
[31:40] could it be that in the manufacturing
[31:42] process people were cutting Corners to
[31:43] make a buck
[31:45] as opposed to doing it very strictly and
[31:47] very carefully so that the penicillin
[31:49] can be effective they thought oh just
[31:50] Mass produce it just do this and just do
[31:51] that and he says it's a money-making
[31:54] greed scheme
[31:56] doctors giving it some time sometimes
[31:58] who don't even know the formula of an
[32:00] aspirin and their father sends them away
[32:02] to get a specialist in something another
[32:04] and don't even know how to cure a tummy
[32:06] ache for a kid
[32:09] okay that's that's pretty hard it says
[32:12] but what have we got greed
[32:15] some pull or little something and this
[32:17] is where I think I think that's all very
[32:18] relevant just to kind of enter into our
[32:20] our conversation they don't have hardly
[32:23] any more of the old-fashioned Country
[32:24] Doctor that used to get down and talk to
[32:26] you and console you and do everything
[32:29] no no it's he's saying now when he's
[32:31] looking at it and as as brother Bam's
[32:33] making his observations as a man and
[32:34] he's looking at it as a minister as a
[32:37] man of God as a prophet he's looking at
[32:38] he's recognizing these things and he
[32:40] could see this continuity he's saying
[32:42] that if you trust your doctor chances
[32:44] are it'll help you and I'm saying that
[32:46] maybe it's hard these days to trust
[32:48] doctors because they don't behave they
[32:50] don't have the bedside manners they
[32:51] don't take the time you don't feel like
[32:53] you just feel like a number you just
[32:54] feel like a patient you just feel like
[32:56] well it's all about insurance it's all
[32:57] about money it's all about this but he
[32:59] is identifying something about that old
[33:01] fashioned Doctor Who would talk to you
[33:04] and console you and do everything
[33:06] something about that
[33:08] I wish I could remember the numbers I
[33:10] read a book one time and it was on it
[33:13] was on the medical profession itself and
[33:16] it was the data suggested that the
[33:19] difference for for a doctor and for you
[33:21] doctors here today you could take this
[33:23] as a bonus
[33:24] that for a doctor the difference between
[33:26] a malpractice suit and not having a
[33:28] malpractice suit was something like one
[33:30] and a half minutes on average more with
[33:32] your patient
[33:33] something very small but they found that
[33:36] doctors that tended to spend more time
[33:38] with their patients were less
[33:39] susceptible to malpractice lawsuits why
[33:42] because the per the patient itself not
[33:44] even that the care was right or wrong in
[33:47] either case malpractice or no
[33:48] malpractice but the patient felt that
[33:51] the doctor was careful caring and
[33:53] concerned and took his time for the
[33:55] patient right and that this put the
[33:57] patient at ease so even if the even if
[34:00] it didn't work out right they weren't
[34:02] suspicious and doubtful about the doctor
[34:04] but a doctor is just really quick not
[34:06] taking the time doing it too fast he's
[34:08] the one that made him susceptible to
[34:09] malpractice lawsuits because of the
[34:11] patient's attitude towards them
[34:13] remember I said they don't hardly have
[34:15] time anymore then he says they leave God
[34:17] right out of the picture because they
[34:19] went after their own way
[34:22] in order to get God on the picture they
[34:24] explained him Plumb away he says there
[34:26] we are
[34:27] that's the danger when you leave God out
[34:30] when you leave God out there's a lot
[34:32] that goes out the window
[34:33] in in a lot of ways there's a trying to
[34:37] find
[34:38] just the right way to say this and that
[34:40] this would be a generalization you take
[34:42] Faith out of the picture you take even
[34:44] moral absolutes out of the picture you
[34:47] take truth out of the picture you start
[34:49] removing these things that relate to God
[34:50] and His nature and his character away
[34:52] there is no altruism
[34:54] there there is there is no I just want
[34:57] to do what's right for you there it's
[34:59] very hard to find that as a
[35:00] generalization and so this brother Bam's
[35:03] identifying and I want you to recognize
[35:05] some of the elements that we struggle
[35:07] with right whether it be well what's in
[35:08] the pill who manufactured it what's in
[35:10] it what does it do what does it do and
[35:11] maybe that's a sense brother I'm saying
[35:13] there's a lack of trust there and if you
[35:14] submitted yourself to the doctor and
[35:15] trust him it'd do you some good but then
[35:17] on the other side there's this idea and
[35:18] just how bad science has gotten how it's
[35:20] become a money-making scheme and how how
[35:22] difficult things have gone but he says
[35:24] where's that doctor that would take his
[35:26] time with you and console you
[35:28] and just in this short statement brother
[35:30] Branham explains why there's a lot of
[35:32] sickness
[35:33] the hybriding of foods the things we're
[35:35] eating and the things we're shoving down
[35:36] our gullet and and how we're filling our
[35:39] pie hole right these all these things
[35:40] are causing the sicknesses cancer mental
[35:42] troubles and all these diseases and so
[35:44] he's explaining the sickness but I
[35:46] believe in some ways he's also wanting
[35:48] to caution us against misplacing our
[35:51] trust
[35:52] that not just wholesale salad selling
[35:55] out to what science wants to give us or
[35:57] wholesale selling out to what the
[35:59] medical industry wants to sell us but
[36:00] he's wanting us to be sure that we don't
[36:02] misplace our trust but he's dropping
[36:04] back even further saying that our minds
[36:06] the power of our minds the power of our
[36:08] emotions how we are made to feel is so
[36:11] important in this process
[36:13] and I believe at the end of the day what
[36:14] he's identifying is who else can you
[36:17] trust but God
[36:22] peek at the time real quick just to know
[36:24] exactly where we're at
[36:26] First Timothy chapter 5 verse 23 this is
[36:29] a very unique scripture
[36:31] not reading this to launch into a debate
[36:34] about
[36:35] drinking wine or
[36:37] whether or not alcohol is acceptable
[36:40] but notice this is I think this is a
[36:42] very familiar scripture and it is one
[36:43] that's often debated
[36:45] but with this as a kind of a foundation
[36:46] some of the things that brother Brown
[36:47] was bringing out about motives of the
[36:49] people and it causes Confusion And how
[36:51] that if you trust your doctor chances
[36:53] are it'll help you
[36:55] and that that doctor who'll take time
[36:57] for you and be interested in those
[36:59] things just how how much it helps the
[37:01] person
[37:01] uh in their attitude
[37:04] he says drink no longer water first
[37:06] Timothy 5 23 some of you might have this
[37:08] memorized drink no longer water but use
[37:11] a little wine for thy stomach's sake and
[37:13] thine often infirmities
[37:15] kind of worded in such a way that's
[37:18] unique drink no longer water
[37:20] um the critic I've come across critics
[37:22] of this who have said that you know what
[37:24] kind of crazy person was Paul to tell
[37:27] Timothy to do it no don't drink water
[37:28] anymore and drink only wine and like
[37:30] that's not what Paul's saying right
[37:32] drink no longer water but use a little
[37:33] wine for thy stomach's sake and thine
[37:35] often infirmities don't always drink
[37:38] only water that's what he's saying
[37:41] but when necessary mix a little wine
[37:44] with your water
[37:46] for your stomach's sake and die often
[37:48] infirmities now Paul is making an
[37:49] observation about Timothy
[37:51] you say oh well this is Paul giving me a
[37:53] prescription to drink wine oh this is
[37:55] Paul making an observation about Timothy
[37:57] and I want you to catch this part the
[37:59] attentiveness and the care that Paul is
[38:02] giving Timothy
[38:03] Paul is a messenger to the age he's a
[38:05] prophet he was one can we see that he
[38:07] was gifted and signs and wonders given
[38:08] power in gifts and miracles and power of
[38:11] God followed him and Paul very very
[38:13] Dynamic and even if you wanted to just
[38:15] relegate him to his Circle and the
[38:16] people he's following Timothy looked up
[38:18] to him Timothy was a son to him Paul now
[38:21] as a prophet as a teacher one who's
[38:23] discipling men to preach the gospel
[38:25] think about all the things he challenged
[38:26] Timothy to do
[38:27] to give attention to study to show
[38:29] myself approve and and he challenges
[38:31] them even on being abstaining from
[38:34] things that would influence the body and
[38:35] there were certain things that would
[38:36] have been very evident in culture and in
[38:38] the teachings that Timothy would have
[38:40] been told to abstain from alcohol to be
[38:42] sober to be temperate to be to be of a
[38:44] ready mind and all these things that
[38:46] Paul challenges Timothy to do and Paul
[38:48] is affirming through his letters he's
[38:50] telling him now notice the attitude of
[38:52] Paul he says to take mix a little wine
[38:55] in with your water to help your stomach
[38:57] if it's upset or whatever may be taking
[38:58] place and your other the other
[39:00] infirmities that you seem to have so
[39:02] often Timothy think about what Paul is
[39:04] doing in this instance
[39:06] do so to help your digestion
[39:09] and and to remove any malady any
[39:11] disorder any sickness which might
[39:13] accompany it
[39:15] one version actually renders it this way
[39:17] uh use a little wine for the pain of the
[39:20] liver
[39:21] and for and for thy Perpetual disease
[39:24] that's one of the ancient translations
[39:26] do it take it from the
[39:28] the dye Glock in the Greek and the
[39:30] Arabic it says take this for your the
[39:32] pain of the liver and for thy Perpetual
[39:35] disease
[39:36] because it says in for thine often
[39:38] infirmities or the weaknesses of your
[39:40] body that may be occasioned by his labor
[39:42] that may come up because of the ministry
[39:44] that may come from the stress of
[39:45] handling the word of God he's looking at
[39:47] Timothy and the things that life brings
[39:49] them and the results that it may be
[39:50] taking in place in his flesh and he
[39:52] looks at Timothy maybe with stomach
[39:53] problems and headaches and all these
[39:55] other maladies and things he's going
[39:56] through and Paul says take a little wine
[40:00] mix it with don't just drink water only
[40:02] but if you need to and your stomach's
[40:03] bother them you have these other
[40:04] ailments mix a little wine in it because
[40:06] it would have had some medicinal purpose
[40:08] and had certain properties that Paul
[40:10] would have attributed to being able to
[40:12] help him address whatever it was going
[40:14] on in his stomach and maybe help his
[40:15] body
[40:16] not to drink to intoxication but just a
[40:18] little bit to address these maoris in
[40:20] this flesh in other words take all
[40:21] proper means to raise the body
[40:24] above these infirmities
[40:26] do what you need to do Timothy in order
[40:29] to see that you're healthy for your
[40:31] calling
[40:31] and I would say that based upon this
[40:33] that God commands all believers to use
[40:36] necessary or reasonable means to
[40:38] maintain Health to use means to improve
[40:41] health
[40:42] because your health matters
[40:44] and and and I I took uh I took the first
[40:47] half of the sermon I did that you know
[40:48] that control X and then pasted it in
[40:51] another document uh it was just going to
[40:53] be to just highlight again God the
[40:55] creator of this body and I want to end
[40:56] on that maybe next Sunday is how that
[40:58] God has fashioned this body and it being
[41:00] his we have a we have a duty to take
[41:02] care of it
[41:04] and so God is commanding us as Believers
[41:06] to use do means to maintain Health to
[41:08] improve health
[41:10] and even to the point where we ought to
[41:12] be thinking about what we eat
[41:15] the Bible deals with it I don't mean to
[41:17] get down into it a whole other area but
[41:19] you realize that when God gave adam
[41:22] Commandments in the beginning everything
[41:24] that he had made That Grew From the
[41:26] ground he says eat everything's gonna be
[41:27] fine why it was natural it was organic
[41:28] truly certified organic
[41:31] and and God had made the body without
[41:33] sin without any perversion that the body
[41:35] would function perfectly in this Garden
[41:37] of Eden diet now there's something that
[41:39] say we need to go back to a Garden of
[41:40] Eden diet well it'd be great if we
[41:42] didn't have post-eaten bodies
[41:45] all right so in this after eating bodies
[41:48] then God actually gives Israel
[41:51] a pretty detailed diet
[41:54] right why because God knows the body and
[41:57] he's concerned about our health and he's
[41:59] concerned about how our body functions
[42:00] and operates and so he's actually
[42:02] telling them don't eat this don't eat
[42:04] this don't eat this don't eat this and
[42:05] now if science catches up to they
[42:07] realize wow those are all the things
[42:09] that are pretty nasty right the Bottom
[42:12] Feeders the ones that got a lot of
[42:13] things that they're just eating on and
[42:15] it doesn't matter and so it mattered
[42:17] enough to God to tell him even what to
[42:18] cook in what not to cook in what to wash
[42:20] with what to mix and God was very very
[42:23] detailed
[42:24] because God commands the Believers to be
[42:27] conscious of their health
[42:28] to use what what they can to maintain
[42:30] and improve the health so notice the
[42:32] care and concern that Paul is showing
[42:34] Timothy
[42:36] and what he recommends
[42:39] now maybe just as drop into a side here
[42:41] I want to read three statements in Jesus
[42:43] Christ the same yesterday today and
[42:44] forever brother Brown makes this
[42:46] statement and he's making it by
[42:47] recounting the conversation he had so if
[42:50] you read it in the sermon brother
[42:51] branham's actually saying I said and
[42:53] this is what he said God heals by
[42:54] medicine
[42:55] God heals by love
[42:57] God heals by understanding God heals by
[43:00] care God heals by prayer
[43:05] God heals by Miracles the whole thing
[43:07] God heals that's all all there is to it
[43:09] he is the Healer
[43:11] all the different ways that God heals
[43:12] medicine love understanding care prayer
[43:16] miracles
[43:18] it's from these statements that I
[43:19] believe I may have misquoted it here
[43:21] recently I said God heals by kind words
[43:24] and it was it was from this I apologize
[43:26] it just came to my mind yesterday as I
[43:28] was reading these again that I might
[43:30] have expressed it that way and and so I
[43:32] don't I'm not trying to make any kind of
[43:33] stretch here at all but just to correct
[43:35] it these are the things that brother bam
[43:37] said he kills by now if I make that if I
[43:40] make the extension that God heals by
[43:42] kind words I'm not explicitly quoting
[43:43] brother Branham but as we read this just
[43:45] notice the varied ways that God does
[43:47] heal
[43:50] and the message look brother says God
[43:51] heals by music
[43:53] God heals by love
[43:55] God heals by medicine
[43:57] God heals by prayer
[43:59] these are the ways that God heals God
[44:01] has many ways of healing
[44:04] pins on what type that you need
[44:07] God has many ways of healing and the way
[44:10] he's going to heal depends on what you
[44:12] need we've mention this a lot Christ
[44:15] demonstrated this in his own Ministry
[44:17] that he approached blindness one way one
[44:20] time another another time he approached
[44:22] the leper one way one time a leper
[44:24] another way another time why it depends
[44:26] on what you need but at the end of the
[44:27] day he's the one that gives it and he
[44:30] chooses even how he's going to send it
[44:34] right and if we're not careful we can
[44:36] get cabbage down so much on it's got to
[44:38] come one way it's got to come one way
[44:39] and God knows the way that you need it
[44:42] healing comes by many different ways it
[44:44] depends on what type you need he says
[44:46] sometimes notice how beautiful this is
[44:48] and let's not detach it from first Peter
[44:50] 5 23. Paul writing to Timothy and saying
[44:53] hey don't just always drink water I know
[44:56] you're strict I know you want to be
[44:57] circumspect I know you're cautioned
[44:59] against all these warnings in the
[45:00] scripture that would pertain to a young
[45:01] man that pertained to us as Believers
[45:03] and it's not given to us as priests it's
[45:05] not given to us as Kings Kings and
[45:06] Priests of God to drink alcohol to drink
[45:08] wine but just mixing in a little enough
[45:11] may help you Timothy Paul was showing
[45:14] that kind of care to Timothy so easy to
[45:16] read over that and not realize just what
[45:17] an impact that would make on Timothy
[45:19] that Paul even cared enough to mention
[45:21] it that Paul even noticed it
[45:24] and brother bear says sometimes a little
[45:25] love stretched out will just cure an old
[45:27] sore
[45:28] an old place that's been a grudge or
[45:30] something it'll heal right over Just a
[45:32] Little Love a Little care
[45:34] remember how large those things played
[45:36] in our actual physical sickness and not
[45:38] being healed and I'm sorry and I forgive
[45:39] those grudges and those things it says
[45:42] just a little love stretched out and
[45:43] that's where I drew that from as far as
[45:44] a kind word sometimes when you feel all
[45:46] down and as we call it a street
[45:48] expression down in the dumps
[45:50] just put on one of those tapes that
[45:52] music or record
[45:54] MP3
[45:55] and go to playing it
[45:57] it's not even MP3 anymore it's just
[45:59] Apple music it's just what plays right
[46:01] it's there it's just
[46:04] it's in the cloud Glory
[46:06] it says
[46:07] first thing you know you're getting
[46:08] you're Pat in your foot or your hand and
[46:10] it's all over then you're right up and
[46:12] ready to go again
[46:15] it's I think what we called it uh when I
[46:17] was young is our walk-up song right
[46:20] he's like what gets you amped up you're
[46:22] like yeah
[46:23] let's do this
[46:25] this right maybe maybe some of you have
[46:27] that Anthem you start in the morning
[46:28] right I have the tiger whatever it is
[46:30] but you're you're all you're ready to go
[46:32] right you're all yeah I'm gonna face the
[46:35] day
[46:36] get my Keurig going my music going come
[46:39] on honey
[46:40] but brother Brahms he's touching on
[46:42] something to me that's very very
[46:43] beautiful the impact of music to a
[46:46] person's atmosphere and feeling that's
[46:47] why you gotta be very careful what you
[46:48] are listening to you're in the car we're
[46:50] just gonna get this guy out of the way
[46:52] you got gangster Christian rap playing
[46:54] what do you expect
[46:58] but it has an impact on your feelings
[47:00] and your emotions and your sensitivities
[47:02] and he's saying just notice the impact
[47:04] that music can have you're down in the
[47:06] dumps you're all sad and you're
[47:07] depressed and the right kind of music
[47:09] the right kind of music can just create
[47:12] that feeling that's why a Saul had David
[47:14] come and play because it could drive
[47:16] away Spirits it can drive away anxiety
[47:18] and fear and brother of Adam backing up
[47:20] says God heals by music
[47:23] now how can music heal
[47:25] all right there's a how how can music
[47:28] heal well let's just try to peek into
[47:30] the black box let's try to pull the
[47:32] curtain back just making an observation
[47:34] based upon what we already know I'm not
[47:36] saying this is the exact causation but
[47:38] if having the right mental attitude
[47:41] towards any promise of God being in the
[47:44] right state of mind being expected being
[47:46] confident being trusting can cause a
[47:48] person to be well or fear can cause
[47:52] disconcerting emotions and can present
[47:54] themselves to certain physical
[47:55] manifestations in music can Center a
[47:58] person's mind and drive away spirits and
[48:01] cause them to be more upbeat and more
[48:03] positive then that's where healing could
[48:05] come from
[48:07] you're up ready right up ready to go
[48:09] again
[48:11] in the sermon he cares do you care
[48:13] remember this is where brother Branham
[48:14] was talking about we don't even have a
[48:16] country doctors anymore
[48:18] that'll that'll take time sit down with
[48:20] you science has gotten into a big
[48:21] money-making greedy thing in the same
[48:23] sermon brother Brown drops back down to
[48:25] this or comes to this he says we believe
[48:26] that doctors help people
[48:29] I believe that God heals my medicine God
[48:32] heals by surgery
[48:34] you realize sometimes just how much we
[48:36] limit God when the doctor's like hey
[48:38] glad we caught it we can take care of it
[48:41] right now with surgery you never have to
[48:42] worry about it again
[48:44] 99.9 percent of the people that we catch
[48:46] at this stage it's gone completely and
[48:49] they talk this way too they have to
[48:51] throw that point one percent in because
[48:52] the lawyers but you know they kind of
[48:55] throw it in there hey look this is this
[48:57] is done and all we need to do is go and
[48:59] do a little outpatient surgery and
[49:01] you'll be fine and you all said no I
[49:02] believe God's going to heal me God's
[49:04] like
[49:07] that's exactly what you need
[49:10] that's that was the easiest way right
[49:14] and God's like okay well I'm just gonna
[49:16] have to work with them I'll just I'm
[49:17] gonna meet him in their need I'm gonna
[49:18] help him right because I'm not gonna I'm
[49:20] not gonna tell you need to fear God will
[49:21] get you where you need to be but God he
[49:23] says God heals my surgery
[49:25] you know I believe that we ought to have
[49:27] this testimony as Believers that no
[49:29] matter what process we go through to
[49:31] achieve our Wellness we give God the
[49:33] credit
[49:34] I'm going to end on this next Sunday on
[49:36] the power of praise and what we do
[49:37] before healing and after our healing and
[49:40] it's all tied up in one thing we might
[49:42] just be able to go straight into the
[49:43] picnic praise
[49:46] because this is something that we can
[49:49] even do so well I thought you had open
[49:51] heart surgeon they did this and they did
[49:52] that yeah God healed me
[49:54] that's perfect doctor says got a new
[49:56] heart
[49:57] right God healed me
[50:00] that's what we that's where we get the
[50:01] glory he says God heals my understanding
[50:04] God heals by love
[50:06] just a little love goes a long way
[50:09] let somebody be all upset and just show
[50:11] them you care for them
[50:13] this is what happens in a relationship
[50:15] this is what can happen within our
[50:17] relationships to one another within a
[50:19] family and and I know the tension that
[50:21] begins to build within families parents
[50:23] to children children even to your
[50:24] parents I know this doesn't make a lot
[50:26] of sense for me to address these young
[50:27] people on the front row but your parents
[50:29] go through a lot sometimes they get
[50:30] frustrated sometimes things build up and
[50:32] if you could just be patient and kind
[50:34] and caring and understanding and it may
[50:35] be they're just having a bad day it can
[50:37] change everything
[50:39] right
[50:40] yeah it could change everything
[50:42] and that's the way that we want to
[50:43] recognize ourselves as adults and his
[50:45] parents that hey we all go through
[50:46] things let's be understanding let's be
[50:47] caring just a little love goes a long
[50:49] way when someone's upset just show them
[50:51] you care for them
[50:52] that's definitely one thing I've noticed
[50:54] that when I look back maybe on my
[50:56] childhood or maybe that comes something
[50:57] that's very present in our very close
[50:59] family relationships in our family of
[51:01] six that there's times when ju what the
[51:04] child needs to know is that you do care
[51:05] even if you don't necessarily see it the
[51:07] same way but it matters you care let's
[51:09] work through this and to kind of
[51:11] de-escalate
[51:15] that's one of the principles to try to
[51:16] teach in our families to de-escalate
[51:19] big words in our family devotion
[51:23] Tech techniques of de-escalation
[51:26] God heals by understanding God heals by
[51:29] love God heals by prayer
[51:31] and the next slide God heals by prayer
[51:33] God heals by miracles
[51:35] God heals by his word
[51:38] God heals
[51:40] whatever Source it is God heals by it
[51:43] that's that that's that's covering a lot
[51:46] toward the end of the day I'm going to
[51:47] give God the glory
[51:49] God heals by his word so now we're just
[51:52] we're taking this
[51:54] we're
[51:55] kind of turning around the corner to
[51:57] close here
[52:00] and and we might even just we may not
[52:02] even finish finish today
[52:06] let's just ask ourselves this question I
[52:08] don't want to lean into it too far
[52:10] because I don't want us to fall over
[52:12] but Paul is Timothy's having stomach
[52:14] problems he has these other things that
[52:16] may have been manifesting itself with it
[52:17] may have been connected to the stomach
[52:18] problems whether it be headaches or some
[52:20] other some other symptoms or conditions
[52:23] just asking the question just to
[52:25] consider why didn't Paul appeal to
[52:26] Timothy to believe for a miracle
[52:29] in this opportunity and I know maybe
[52:31] there's no satisfactory answer to it
[52:33] perhaps was it why didn't he just write
[52:35] in first Timothy 5 23 he says Hey and
[52:37] for those headaches believe God
[52:39] because that certainly would have been
[52:40] appropriate right
[52:42] why didn't he even use his gift of
[52:44] Miracles
[52:45] Paul hit the supernatural had been
[52:47] demonstrated in Paul's life why wouldn't
[52:49] this be an opportunity for Paul just to
[52:51] say hey you know what next time I'm with
[52:53] you I'm going to pray for you I'm going
[52:54] to lay my hands on you and and do uh and
[52:57] and anoint you with oil there's there's
[53:00] ways that Paul could have addressed this
[53:01] that would have in our minds been the
[53:04] superior approach and certainly that
[53:06] more faith-based just take God in his
[53:08] word just belief for your healing but
[53:09] Paul doesn't do that
[53:11] and I believe what Paul is doing and
[53:14] maybe if I can't say that he's conscious
[53:16] of it what God presents to the scripture
[53:18] is this remarkable balance of the pain
[53:21] and suffering that Timothy is going
[53:23] through and and what would remedy it
[53:27] because this is very important to bring
[53:29] this up and I know that I may not be
[53:31] treating this with as much time as we
[53:33] ought to have
[53:35] but I believe we've been taught it so
[53:36] much that it's just very very easy for
[53:39] us to begin to kind of drill down that
[53:40] line and go down the line pull up a lot
[53:42] of scriptures and quotations to support
[53:44] this but Paul understood the balance
[53:47] that we have when it comes to pain and
[53:48] suffering because he knew Affliction
[53:50] brings Glory
[53:53] he knew there is even something to be
[53:55] gained by being uncomfortable
[53:58] he knew there was some no matter what
[54:00] all things worked together for the good
[54:02] so Paul knew that if God allows
[54:05] something
[54:06] that there's there's this wrong attitude
[54:08] to look at something that is hard that
[54:11] is difficult that is painful that might
[54:13] even be a physical malady it's it can be
[54:16] very detrimental to have the wrong
[54:18] attitude towards it towards like oh this
[54:20] is just the devil that's going to
[54:22] destroy me okay maybe it's the devil but
[54:24] it's going to keep you humble it's going
[54:25] to give you greater sensitivity it's
[54:27] going to make you more empathetic maybe
[54:29] it is but maybe God is going to use it
[54:31] because he said he would for good
[54:38] Romans 8 18.
[54:40] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[54:42] present time
[54:43] are not worthy to be compared with the
[54:45] glory which shall be revealed in US
[54:50] there's profit and affliction
[54:53] I've said it before I think it Bears
[54:55] repeating that every suffering is
[54:58] pregnant with Glory
[55:00] whenever you are suffering know that it
[55:03] can only for the believer deliver Glory
[55:06] that in the final outcome the final
[55:08] product if I'm going through a struggle
[55:10] a trial a challenge is just an
[55:11] opportunity to succeed a trial is an
[55:13] opportunity for victory no matter what
[55:15] it is you realize that this has got to
[55:17] be pregnant with Glory
[55:19] that no matter what we're going through
[55:21] a Believer can point and say see this
[55:24] see this there's good that can come out
[55:26] of it no matter what it is I know it may
[55:29] seem crazy to the world but it's God's
[55:31] promise and it's never failed that we
[55:33] could look at this and say there can be
[55:35] or there is there is a victory in this
[55:37] there's glory in this there's a benefit
[55:39] in this
[55:41] and don't think for a second that Paul
[55:42] is just sitting there worry free
[55:45] pain-free
[55:47] you know just the beautiful physical
[55:49] specimen you know just one of those guys
[55:50] you would just Envy eats whatever he
[55:52] wants it looks like that right that's
[55:55] not Paul Paul was Paul knew what it was
[55:57] like to suffer he knew what it meant to
[56:00] be afflicted he knew what it meant to
[56:01] feel down so his counsel is not empty
[56:04] our text said it this way second
[56:06] Corinthians 12 7 8 9 and lest I should
[56:08] be exalted above measure to the
[56:09] abundance of Revelations that was given
[56:11] to me a thorn in the flesh and notice a
[56:14] messenger of Satan to Buffet me
[56:16] so guess a messenger of Satan some
[56:19] sickness some malady I know maybe taking
[56:21] Liberty with the language but many
[56:22] surmise that Paul was actually talking
[56:24] about bad eyesight
[56:26] that there's something physically wrong
[56:28] with Paul Something In the Flesh uh
[56:31] persistent disease a chronic injury
[56:34] something wrong that Paul wanted to be
[56:36] healed of and he said it was a messenger
[56:39] of Satan
[56:42] and it says in verse 8 I know I'm
[56:43] skipping a little bit of the context how
[56:45] that Paul
[56:46] so humble right because of the abundance
[56:49] of Revelations
[56:50] I had to have this messenger of Satan to
[56:52] keep me humble
[56:55] but nonetheless he's identifying a
[56:58] sickness a problem and ailment some sort
[56:59] of injury something that is bringing him
[57:01] low
[57:03] and he says
[57:04] in verse 8 for this thing I besought the
[57:07] Lord Thrice that it might depart from me
[57:09] what was he asking for healing
[57:11] Deliverance a miracle I've lived with
[57:15] this I've suffered with this I I don't
[57:16] know how to handle this the pain the
[57:18] injury whatever it might have been uh
[57:20] what whatever since it was so it was
[57:22] important enough and debilitated enough
[57:24] to where now he asked God three times
[57:25] that he would be healed delivered depart
[57:27] from me this messenger saying this Thorn
[57:29] In My Flesh if I could just put it this
[57:30] way God heal me God heal me God heal me
[57:35] and he said unto me my grace is
[57:37] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[57:39] made perfect in weakness
[57:41] so Paul's attitude changes
[57:43] most gladly therefore I rather glory in
[57:46] my infirmities that the power of Christ
[57:47] May rest upon me
[57:50] my grace is sufficient
[57:52] it's unfailing strength
[57:55] my grace is enough
[57:58] my grace is enough to remove any barrier
[58:01] my grace is enough to raise you up
[58:02] Beyond this my grace is enough to
[58:04] elevate my grace is sufficient in your
[58:07] sickness you see a detriment but my
[58:09] grace is sufficient to overcome every
[58:11] detriment so that even to the point to
[58:13] where you have absolute confidence that
[58:16] in the present of the persistent and
[58:19] chronic illness Grace is still
[58:21] sufficient
[58:23] it's not even necessary that we say oh
[58:25] well grace is sufficient to heal it if
[58:28] God never heals me his grace is
[58:30] sufficient if I never have better
[58:33] eyesight if I never have if I always
[58:35] live with a arthritis if I always have
[58:38] this if I always have that I still stand
[58:41] with this absolute fervent conviction
[58:44] that God's grace is sufficient
[58:47] that where I lack physically where I
[58:49] lack emotionally where I lack in all
[58:51] these areas of my life because of injury
[58:53] or trauma or abuse or chronic illness I
[58:56] still believe that in the face of it his
[58:58] grace is sufficient if I if I'm never
[59:02] healed if it never departs his grace is
[59:05] sufficient
[59:10] Paul understood now this is where it
[59:12] gets
[59:13] I just love the atmosphere you've you
[59:15] all have been able to create today
[59:19] now I want to be very careful on how I
[59:21] say this
[59:23] Paul understood
[59:25] the primary
[59:27] Paul understood the primary purpose of
[59:30] Miracles
[59:32] was to catch the unbeliever's attention
[59:35] and do condition or predispose the
[59:38] believer or the unbeliever to Faith
[59:41] now there's some that have taken that
[59:43] scriptural principle that we can
[59:45] identify in scripture and that's they
[59:47] take the leap then to days of Miracles
[59:49] are past that God used it to establish
[59:51] the faith once the faith is established
[59:53] we have no more use for it now it's
[59:56] you're too late for that devil right
[59:58] but think about this in terms of and
[1:00:00] we've dealt with this at the very
[1:00:01] beginning of the series we deal with it
[1:00:03] quite often to keep us always in the
[1:00:05] channel of growing
[1:00:07] right not the Cycles but growing
[1:00:10] Paul understood that God used miracles
[1:00:14] to cause the unbeliever to to believe to
[1:00:16] have faith
[1:00:18] so Timothy already being a believer
[1:00:21] Timothy this is a this is I've only
[1:00:23] spend a little bit of time on it but boy
[1:00:25] if you could just let God anchor this in
[1:00:26] your heart this could be the liberty for
[1:00:28] somebody this could be the healing for
[1:00:29] somebody
[1:00:30] Paul Timothy already being a Believer
[1:00:33] already having been birthed by the power
[1:00:34] of the Holy Ghost in his soul didn't
[1:00:36] need a miracle to believe
[1:00:39] are you thinking about this
[1:00:40] Paul Timothy in his condition could have
[1:00:43] remained sick all of his life Paul and
[1:00:45] his condition persistent debilitating
[1:00:47] condition and asked God to deliver him
[1:00:49] three times they they could have
[1:00:50] remained that way and they never needed
[1:00:52] a miracle to to believe in God
[1:00:56] never needed it
[1:00:58] never required wouldn't have needed it
[1:01:00] once the soul was sealed then they
[1:01:02] believed and God knew he was real trust
[1:01:04] in the Divine Providence of God and they
[1:01:06] weren't thirsty for a miracle in order
[1:01:08] to vindicate their position in Christ
[1:01:10] they weren't thirsty for a miracle so
[1:01:12] that God would prove that he loved them
[1:01:14] they were already settled in that and
[1:01:17] the Miracle wasn't necessary for them to
[1:01:19] have any greater faith in God
[1:01:21] but what was more necessary was the
[1:01:24] affliction
[1:01:26] think about the wisdom of God it was
[1:01:28] more necessary that they suffered the
[1:01:31] illness than to see the miracle because
[1:01:33] it was more profitable than the
[1:01:35] supernatural cure
[1:01:38] think about that God and His Providence
[1:01:40] recognizes these things and sees that
[1:01:43] you might be so so desperate for a
[1:01:46] miracle and you're you're driving
[1:01:47] yourself crazy to be healed and God
[1:01:50] wants you just to trust him and believe
[1:01:52] his grace is sufficient because
[1:01:54] sometimes the Affliction is more
[1:01:57] necessary for us than the miracle
[1:02:08] my
[1:02:13] so then can I talk about the
[1:02:15] pre-existing condition
[1:02:17] for a moment
[1:02:19] established once in all the foundation
[1:02:21] for our faith
[1:02:22] the foundation for all healing
[1:02:25] is God foundation for thy feeling is
[1:02:27] faith
[1:02:28] and we all realize I mean
[1:02:31] and thanks
[1:02:33] for thanks to Obamacare
[1:02:37] and that may have been the first time
[1:02:38] ever uttered over a Christian Pulpit
[1:02:40] without some sort of sarcasm but the
[1:02:43] Affordable Care Act
[1:02:45] before that it was maybe more prominent
[1:02:47] in our minds but a pre-existing
[1:02:49] condition is a health problem before you
[1:02:51] get insurance coverage right that's what
[1:02:53] a pre-existing kitten when I said it
[1:02:54] that's what everybody thought of like I
[1:02:55] guess we're getting our insurance lesson
[1:02:57] today
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:58] that's what we all think about so it
[1:03:00] could be cancer diabetes arthritis some
[1:03:02] something that has been previously uh
[1:03:05] there's different levels to this but
[1:03:06] previously diagnosed and treated
[1:03:09] or even pregnancy is a pre-existing
[1:03:11] condition
[1:03:13] and
[1:03:14] nowadays
[1:03:16] if you get
[1:03:18] um Insurance under the Affordable Care
[1:03:19] Act insurance companies cannot charge
[1:03:21] you more or refuse coverage because of a
[1:03:24] pre-existing condition or can't provide
[1:03:27] you less treatment can I get a witness
[1:03:29] right this is what we get under the the
[1:03:31] health care act today now there's
[1:03:33] grandfathered plans the individual plans
[1:03:35] they're grandfathered in in other words
[1:03:37] plans that you pay for because you're
[1:03:38] self-employed can I get a witness and
[1:03:41] those health insurance plans are very
[1:03:42] very expensive and they'll be like look
[1:03:44] the only thing that we will guarantee is
[1:03:46] the oxygen you breathe naturally
[1:03:48] right and anything else is a
[1:03:50] pre-existing condition
[1:03:52] and they can still deny coverage because
[1:03:54] of it
[1:03:55] so in the in the in terms of treatment
[1:03:58] in terms of coverage in terms of we got
[1:04:00] you we're a partner in this sickness
[1:04:02] we're partnering with you in this
[1:04:04] illness you're pregnant doesn't matter
[1:04:06] if it's a pre-existing condition doesn't
[1:04:07] matter we're here we'll step in we'll
[1:04:09] pay we'll get you the care you need
[1:04:11] that's what it means from the natural
[1:04:13] standpoint but you've got a pre-existing
[1:04:15] condition
[1:04:17] as a believer
[1:04:19] and that's your healing
[1:04:22] you've got a pre-existing condition to
[1:04:24] any sickness to any disease that's your
[1:04:26] faith
[1:04:27] this is something that in the midst of
[1:04:29] what Paul Timothy was going through in
[1:04:31] the midst of what Paul experienced their
[1:04:33] pre-existing condition of faith is What
[1:04:36] mattered
[1:04:37] that's what held sway that's what was
[1:04:40] the most important thing for them to
[1:04:41] remember is I am a believer and I'm not
[1:04:44] thirsty for a miracle to stay a Believer
[1:04:46] I am a believer Miracle or not I'm a
[1:04:48] Believer I trust God I've Got Confidence
[1:04:50] in God and it's from that state and from
[1:04:52] that position that I'm going to believe
[1:04:54] I've got a pre-existing condition that
[1:04:56] before the world was even formed in the
[1:04:58] mind of God the stripes were there the
[1:05:01] blood was shed there was a tongue why I
[1:05:03] was yet a sinner Christ died for me
[1:05:06] before I ever came into being her
[1:05:08] manifestation that he paid the price for
[1:05:10] me there's a pre-existing condition it's
[1:05:12] his promise
[1:05:15] it's something that supersedes
[1:05:19] let me borrow something from Brother
[1:05:20] Branham I'll use a little bit different
[1:05:21] we have health assurance
[1:05:24] I am the Lord that heals all thy
[1:05:26] diseases we have health Assurance it's a
[1:05:28] pre-existing condition that means
[1:05:30] there's nothing nothing future nothing
[1:05:32] past nothing present there's no family
[1:05:34] history there's no family future there's
[1:05:36] no current state there's a place where
[1:05:38] the believer gets where they're
[1:05:39] absolutely sure that his grace is
[1:05:41] sufficient Paul says who shall separate
[1:05:44] us from the love of Christ shall
[1:05:45] tribulation distress persecution famine
[1:05:50] nakedness Peril or sword come on Paul
[1:05:53] tell me
[1:05:54] he wants to cover everything and in a
[1:05:56] minute he's going to go ahead and cover
[1:05:57] it front back sideways up and down he
[1:05:59] makes sure it's all covered he's
[1:06:01] basically saying what's going to
[1:06:02] separate you from the love of Christ
[1:06:05] what's going to separate you from that
[1:06:06] anchor that makes powerful relevant
[1:06:09] power relevant what's going to separate
[1:06:11] from that anchor that makes a soberness
[1:06:13] relevant what's going to separate you
[1:06:15] from the love of Christ he says in verse
[1:06:17] 36 let's just all be honest for thy for
[1:06:19] thy sake we are killed all the day long
[1:06:21] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:06:22] slaughter that's what we have to endure
[1:06:24] that's what we go through many are the
[1:06:26] afflictions of the righteous but does
[1:06:27] that separate us from the love of God he
[1:06:29] says nay no no no no no in all these
[1:06:33] things tribulation distress persecution
[1:06:35] famine nakedness Peril and sword all
[1:06:37] these things we are more than conquerors
[1:06:40] we're not just survivors we're thriving
[1:06:42] we're not just getting by we're
[1:06:44] conquering we're more than conquerors
[1:06:45] through him that loved us for I am
[1:06:48] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:06:51] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:06:53] nor things present nor things to come
[1:06:55] nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:06:57] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:07:00] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:07:02] Jesus our lord
[1:07:04] but we ought to have the right the right
[1:07:06] attitude towards the things that we
[1:07:07] endure remember this no matter what you
[1:07:09] what sickness you have sickness is not a
[1:07:11] sentence
[1:07:13] check this is never a sickness is never
[1:07:16] something that's imposed upon you put on
[1:07:18] you as a sentence it is just a state
[1:07:24] we'll hold there and come back to it
[1:07:27] nothing shall separate us from the love
[1:07:29] of Christ
[1:07:32] nothing
[1:07:36] could you believe for all things
[1:07:39] believe all things are possible
[1:07:41] nothing shall be able to separate us
[1:07:44] your pre-existing condition don't ever
[1:07:45] remember it the love of God
[1:07:49] faith
[1:07:50] the blood
[1:07:51] that no matter what you're going through
[1:07:53] now there was something that pre-existed
[1:07:55] and there's something that will be
[1:07:58] and we're anchored in the sufficiency of
[1:08:00] Christ
[1:08:02] I hope God can help you today
[1:08:04] I know we covered a lot of ground I'm
[1:08:06] just going to stop we'll leave the rest
[1:08:07] for another time
[1:08:10] may the Lord help you I know there's
[1:08:12] real needs
[1:08:14] I'm not being dismissive at all I know
[1:08:15] there's real needs but I believe this is
[1:08:17] needful
[1:08:19] God help us
[1:08:20] you love them
[1:08:21] I know you do he loves you too
[1:08:24] could we stand together today
