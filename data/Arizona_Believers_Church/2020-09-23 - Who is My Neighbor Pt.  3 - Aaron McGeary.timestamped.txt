[0:41] so father we can we can see things that

[1:13] have now father
[1:14] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:16] pray amen
[1:18] amen take your bibles and turn to luke
[1:20] chapter 10
[1:22] i'd like to read and start with verse 25
[1:24] again
[1:25] and read to verse 37.
[1:31] it's nice to see the plets down from
[1:33] flagstaff tonight
[1:34] and that probably makes it just
[1:37] doubly difficult on sister elizabeth
[1:39] that she had to play the piano
[1:41] when they're such an uh accomplished
[1:43] musician in our midst but we can
[1:45] it's nice just maybe take a night off
[1:47] right and just sit and enjoy a service
[1:48] but it's nice to see them and all the
[1:50] many that are out
[1:51] in the house of the lord tonight we just
[1:52] welcome you we're so glad to see you
[1:54] here
[1:55] luke chapter 10 verse 25 says
[1:59] and it's known as the parable of the
[2:01] good samaritan this is the
[2:03] the discussion that leads to it
[2:07] and um i'm going to turn in the right
[2:09] spot i almost began to read in john
[2:10] chapter 10 verse 25 it says and behold a
[2:13] certain lawyer stood up luke chapter 10
[2:15] verse 25 a certain
[2:16] lawyer stood up and tempted him saying
[2:18] master what shall i do to inherit
[2:21] eternal life and then jesus just turns
[2:23] the question right back on him
[2:25] he said unto him what is written in the
[2:27] law how readers thou what
[2:28] what what is when the law speaks to
[2:30] eternal life how do you read it what is
[2:32] how do you feel about it he says and he
[2:34] answering said thou shalt
[2:36] love the lord thy god with all thy heart
[2:37] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[2:40] strength
[2:41] and with all thy mind and thy neighbor
[2:43] as thyself
[2:44] and he said unto him thou hast answered
[2:46] right this do
[2:48] and thou shalt live and so jesus has now
[2:51] turned
[2:51] the question on the questioner and he's
[2:54] put the lawyer in a difficult spot
[2:56] because now the lawyer has testified as
[2:58] to what it takes to have eternal life
[3:00] and then jesus says well then do it just
[3:02] do do what you've said and
[3:04] you'll live and now feeling condemnation
[3:07] or conviction
[3:08] he says but he verse 29 willing to
[3:10] justify himself
[3:11] said unto jesus and who is my neighbor
[3:15] and jesus answering said and this is
[3:17] where he gives the parable
[3:18] to expound upon who your neighbor is a
[3:21] certain man went down from jerusalem to
[3:23] jericho and
[3:24] fell among thieves who stripped him of
[3:26] his raiment and wounded him
[3:27] and departed leaving him half dead and
[3:30] by chance there came down
[3:32] a certain priest that way and when he
[3:33] saw him he passed by on
[3:35] the other side and likewise a levite
[3:38] when he was at the place came
[3:40] and looked on him and passed by on the
[3:42] other side
[3:43] but a certain samaritan as he journeyed
[3:46] came where he was
[3:47] and when he saw him he had compassion on
[3:49] him and he went to him and bound up his
[3:52] wounds
[3:52] pouring in oil and wine and set him on
[3:54] his own beast and brought him to an end
[3:56] and took care of him and it even shows
[3:59] that this this care would have taken
[4:01] place over
[4:01] hours even now overnight because it says
[4:03] and on the morrow
[4:04] when he departed he took out two pence
[4:07] and gave them to the host and said unto
[4:09] him take care of him
[4:10] and whatsoever thou spend us more when i
[4:12] come again i will repay thee so
[4:15] whatever you need whatever expenses you
[4:17] incur please take care of them
[4:19] i will make you whole when i come back
[4:21] then jesus
[4:22] asked of the lawyer now which of these
[4:25] three so which now of these three
[4:27] thinketh thou was neighbor unto him that
[4:29] fell among the thieves who do you think
[4:31] lawyer
[4:32] was the neighbor to this one who was
[4:34] wounded a neighbor to this man
[4:36] who was robbed and the lawyer in verse
[4:39] 37 he said
[4:40] he that showed mercy on him then said
[4:43] jesus unto him go
[4:44] and do thou likewise you can be seated
[4:48] i'm just going to pick up where we were
[4:50] last wednesday night
[4:52] and i don't think that will leave
[4:54] anybody out in doing so
[4:56] because we just want to continue to
[4:57] expound upon this subject
[4:59] of who is my neighbor
[5:02] and i want to read a statement that we
[5:04] had read at the end of towards the end
[5:06] of service from that day on calvary
[5:08] and brother branham says speaking of
[5:10] jesus he says he lived and had eternal
[5:12] life
[5:13] because he did not live for himself so
[5:16] it wasn't that
[5:18] not living for himself gave him eternal
[5:20] life but the expression or the
[5:22] manifestation that he had eternal life
[5:24] was in that he did not live for himself
[5:26] so eternal life is not characterized by
[5:29] selfish living
[5:30] he lived for others and you receive
[5:33] eternal life by receiving
[5:34] that day by receiving christ the
[5:36] sacrifice on that day of calvary
[5:38] and he says and you don't live for
[5:40] yourself no more you live for others
[5:42] someone said how can you stand and let
[5:44] anyone call you such bad names
[5:46] you don't live for yourself you live for
[5:49] others that you might redeem
[5:50] that man and so he's pointing out
[5:53] someone says well how could you
[5:54] stand by and let people criticize you or
[5:57] make fun of you
[5:58] and brother brown's response is well you
[5:59] don't live for yourself anymore
[6:01] if you've accepted the cross if you've
[6:03] received salvation if you're born again
[6:05] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[6:07] then that sets inside of you a different
[6:09] nature that you can live by
[6:11] and and granted we have a flesh that's
[6:13] still sticky and something that we fight
[6:14] against so it's not just
[6:16] instinctive so it's something that we
[6:17] have to feed something that we're
[6:19] instructed in
[6:20] he says now we ought to yield to this
[6:22] unselfish
[6:23] nature that's on the inside of us and
[6:25] live for others
[6:26] he says you live for others that you
[6:28] might redeem that man now what man is he
[6:30] talking about the one that stands by and
[6:32] calls you bad names
[6:33] that's pretty that's pretty heavy stuff
[6:35] but then he brings it down to this he
[6:37] says you become
[6:38] sons and the trouble of it is that the
[6:40] church has forgot
[6:42] they were sons you are sons now he's
[6:45] establishing
[6:47] the fact that you can love or you can
[6:50] react or you can
[6:51] be kind or live for others even to those
[6:54] who do wrong to you
[6:55] because you are a son so there's
[6:57] something about being a son that
[6:59] empowers
[7:00] a person to be able to do good to
[7:02] someone who does evil to them
[7:04] you don't do it because you're weak you
[7:06] don't do it because you're afraid you're
[7:07] going to be bullied you can do it
[7:08] because you
[7:09] are a son he says you're taking christ's
[7:12] place
[7:12] you are sons so don't live for yourself
[7:15] live for others
[7:16] so there's a power inherent in our
[7:18] position as
[7:19] sons and daughters of god whereby we can
[7:21] live for others even those
[7:23] who would do us wrong he says well
[7:25] brother branham i can live for this
[7:26] brother
[7:27] because he sure is a nice man he says
[7:29] that's not it
[7:31] live for the man who hates you live for
[7:34] that person who would kill you
[7:35] if they could that that i mean that just
[7:38] kind of leaves it wide open because i
[7:41] um and i'm not soliciting people to let
[7:43] me know but
[7:44] i don't know anybody who wants to kill
[7:45] me but he's basically saying hey
[7:48] live for the person that would kill you
[7:51] so he puts it in the furthest most
[7:52] extreme and some of us might say well
[7:54] brother branham you don't have to get
[7:55] all dramatic well he's trying to make a
[7:56] point
[7:57] that you ought to live for the man who
[7:59] hates you live for the one that would
[8:00] kill you if they could
[8:01] that's what they'd done to him they
[8:03] killed him and he died that he might
[8:05] save them
[8:06] and who was it on the day of pentecost
[8:07] that peter preaches salvation too
[8:10] he says you have crucified the lord of
[8:12] glory and they didn't say
[8:14] because of this you're you've negated
[8:16] your ability to be saved he said no
[8:18] you have to receive this very one that
[8:20] you've murdered this very one that
[8:22] you've crucified
[8:23] and so this is the love of god expressed
[8:25] this is the power of overcoming they
[8:27] killed him and he died that he might
[8:29] save them
[8:29] that's eternal life when that's in your
[8:32] bosom you're facing heaven then
[8:34] my praise the lord when that when that
[8:36] is in your bosom and that can be in your
[8:38] heart to love the one that hates
[8:40] you and and to resist the urge to even
[8:42] defend yourself or tear down the person
[8:44] who's tearing you down
[8:46] says then you're facing heaven and and
[8:49] wouldn't uh and i wouldn't say anything
[8:51] that would suggest that you're
[8:52] not a christian if you say things
[8:54] critical you do things that are wrong
[8:55] you've just stopped facing heaven it's
[8:58] when we get our eyes off of heaven we
[9:00] get our eyes off the word of god we get
[9:01] our eyes off the nature of christ
[9:03] and then when we're only looking at the
[9:04] carnal then we begin to respond carnally
[9:06] we responded kind
[9:08] we meet the person's intensity if
[9:10] they're angry we get angry back if
[9:11] they're critical
[9:12] we get critical back and we just kind of
[9:15] engage in that
[9:16] in that fight with evil and we start to
[9:19] render evil on the same on the same
[9:21] level but face heaven
[9:23] and you can overcome those instincts
[9:24] that are inherent in our flesh
[9:26] to respond in kind and brother branham
[9:30] we read a number of statements where he
[9:31] said eternal life is living for others
[9:33] and we see that very plain in the
[9:35] message
[9:35] how he just articulates that so
[9:37] beautifully and then he makes a
[9:38] statement that the holy ghost
[9:40] entertains the church with eternal life
[9:43] now we could read that to say the church
[9:45] that has eternal life is entertained by
[9:47] the holy ghost
[9:48] but it struck me this way the holy ghost
[9:51] entertains the church
[9:52] with eternal life in other words the
[9:54] holy ghost the entertainment of the
[9:56] church through the holy ghost
[9:58] is eternal life he entertains us with
[10:00] the eternal life so our entertainment
[10:02] is eternal life and if eternal life is
[10:05] living for others the bride's
[10:07] entertainment
[10:08] is living for others and you might say
[10:10] oh that sounds so boring
[10:12] well okay i'm not gonna i won't argue
[10:14] with you i mean sometimes it might seem
[10:16] to be more of a chore but he's in the
[10:18] bride's entertainment those are my words
[10:20] is living for others it's
[10:21] being in service for our lord because
[10:24] we're called to serve we're called to
[10:25] minister
[10:26] not be ministered to but to minister you
[10:29] are the recipients
[10:30] of a grace grace you are the recipients
[10:33] of the greatest thing that's ever struck
[10:34] the earth you are the recipients
[10:36] of something so supernatural so profound
[10:39] not that we would just lay back and
[10:41] merely be ministered to but to be
[10:43] empowered to minister that's the real
[10:46] beauty of what we've received in this
[10:48] day it doesn't make us helpless it
[10:49] doesn't make us hopeless
[10:50] but it gives us our faith to act it
[10:52] gives us faith to help
[10:54] not be hopeless and to only be helped
[10:56] ourselves
[10:58] and brother brahm talks about how the
[10:59] greatest joy you'll find is in living
[11:01] for others and serving others
[11:03] and that's how i i can see that living
[11:06] for others is our entertainment
[11:08] that if you're selfish then that that
[11:09] will bring you down when you when you
[11:11] only acknowledge your own needs and want
[11:13] others to meet those needs and you're
[11:14] only confessing i'm needy i'm needy i
[11:16] need help i need help and always with
[11:18] your hand out that'll just bring your
[11:20] spirit down but if you can say well i
[11:21] may not have certain things and i'm
[11:23] needy in some areas but what i do have
[11:25] i'll give and
[11:26] how i can help i help you'll find that
[11:28] it'll lift you up and it'll encourage
[11:30] you and give you purpose in life
[11:32] and bring real joy so in this
[11:36] and this i'll say this this is the issue
[11:38] that's central
[11:39] to the answer to the question who is my
[11:41] neighbor in luke 10 29
[11:43] when the when the lawyer says well then
[11:45] who is my neighbor
[11:46] the it's this what's still central to
[11:48] this discussion
[11:49] is eternal life so he asked how can i
[11:52] obtain eternal life
[11:53] he says well how do you read the law
[11:55] what do you think the law says he says
[11:56] well love the lord thy god
[11:57] and love thy neighbor as thyself and
[11:59] then and jesus says perfect
[12:01] and he goes well then who is my neighbor
[12:04] so
[12:04] the issue still is eternal life and we
[12:07] can see
[12:07] living for living for others loving your
[12:09] neighbor is
[12:11] is harmonious with and speaks of
[12:14] uh love eternal life now so the question
[12:18] in verse 29 is
[12:19] who is my neighbor and when he asks this
[12:22] question and
[12:23] and now we can say review is over i want
[12:25] to i just want to go further in in this
[12:27] i was pondering this afternoon if at any
[12:30] point you feel like brother aaron i get
[12:32] it you can move on just let me know
[12:33] personally
[12:35] if you let somebody else know they might
[12:36] agree with you and then everybody can
[12:38] let everybody else know and then i'm the
[12:39] only one who feels like we don't get it
[12:41] so just let me know he said brother
[12:42] aaron i think we got it you can move on
[12:43] and i'll say
[12:44] excellent and then once i heard from
[12:46] hear from all of you i'll move on
[12:49] don't just wait till after service
[12:50] though
[12:52] so this uh this question that is asked
[12:55] because i realize i may just be
[12:57] laboring something over and over again
[12:58] and seem to be just putting more layers
[13:00] on this but
[13:01] i i believe it's helpful at this
[13:02] juncture so this question of who is my
[13:05] neighbors
[13:06] tied with the commandment or the law
[13:08] that jesus kind of brings up and
[13:10] provokes him about what is written in
[13:11] the law what do you how do you read the
[13:13] law
[13:14] and so this law that the lawyer begins
[13:16] to recite now shalt love the lord thy
[13:17] god with all thy heart with all thy soul
[13:19] and all thy strength
[13:20] and love thy neighbor as thyself his
[13:23] questions connected with that law
[13:25] now in leviticus chapter 19 verse 18 it
[13:28] says thou shalt not avenge
[13:30] nor bear any grudge against the children
[13:32] of thy people
[13:33] but so here's a conjunction so it's thou
[13:35] shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge
[13:37] against the children of thy people but
[13:39] so that this conjunction now
[13:40] kind of is the retort or the reply to
[13:42] this avenging and grudging
[13:44] but thou shalt love the lord thy
[13:46] neighbor as thyself
[13:47] i am the lord so it's the lord that's
[13:50] giving this commandment
[13:51] to not avenge not judge excuse me grudge
[13:55] but love thy neighbor as thyself and i
[13:58] wanted to take a moment just to look at
[13:59] these two
[14:00] characteristics of not avenging nor
[14:02] bearing any grudge
[14:04] to avenge means to take vengeance or
[14:07] even just to entertain revengeful
[14:09] feelings so that's
[14:10] that's something that we're all familiar
[14:11] with we're all familiar with how if
[14:13] something happens to you you want to see
[14:15] justice if somebody does something to
[14:17] you you want to do to them
[14:19] what they did to you if not worse and
[14:21] just kind of escalate it
[14:22] so say don't take vengeance or even
[14:24] entertain the thought of
[14:25] they need to be paid back and and they
[14:28] need to get what's coming to them
[14:29] even from a sense of justice even when
[14:32] it's even when that person is acted
[14:33] wrong it's not
[14:34] just saying that you you you're vengeful
[14:36] without cause but
[14:37] even with cause wanting to take
[14:39] vengeance or seek revenge
[14:41] and this would be an illustration of
[14:44] vengeance just to kind of help you
[14:46] understand what the scripture's talking
[14:47] about so an example of vengeance would
[14:50] be
[14:51] if i if i went to brother john and i
[14:53] said brother john can i
[14:55] borrow a shovel and and uh he says
[14:58] uh no you can't borrow my shovel and
[15:01] then the next day he brother john comes
[15:02] to me and says brother aaron can i
[15:04] borrow a rake and then i basically my
[15:07] response to him is
[15:08] no brother john since you wouldn't let
[15:10] me borrow a shovel
[15:11] i'm not going to let you borrow a rake
[15:14] that's what it means to be vengeful
[15:16] and that's exactly what the scripture is
[15:18] talking about that we shouldn't do
[15:20] and i think i put it in terms to where
[15:21] all of us start to feel
[15:23] i'm guilty i've done that before
[15:26] i did that today right
[15:29] because it's just that simple and if my
[15:31] children could listen right now they'd
[15:32] realize
[15:33] this characterizes most of their
[15:35] exchanges well you wouldn't let me play
[15:36] with that so i'm not going to let you
[15:38] play with this
[15:39] what that's vengeance and that really
[15:41] sounds cruel to a five-year-old or an
[15:43] eight-year-old but that's what it is
[15:44] it's that feeling of
[15:45] well since you didn't let me borrow your
[15:47] shovel i'm not gonna let you have my
[15:48] rake and the bible said don't do that
[15:50] that's petty don't engage in that uh
[15:54] here's your opportunity to reverse the
[15:55] cycle or this is your opportunity to
[15:57] kind of change things where
[15:59] he didn't let you borrow the shovel now
[16:00] he wants to ball the rake maybe if you
[16:02] give him the rake he'll let you borrow
[16:03] the shovel
[16:04] because he's going to walk away with the
[16:05] rake and be like wow that was really
[16:07] nice of him
[16:08] i refused my shovel and then he comes
[16:11] back with the shovel and says hey
[16:12] you you wanted to borrow the shovel
[16:13] here's the shovel while i use your rake
[16:16] we have just a way of changing things
[16:18] but this is how feelings become very
[16:20] entrenched and people begin to be
[16:21] polarized
[16:22] because of these kind of attitudes this
[16:24] this feeling of wanting vengeance
[16:26] and then so there it says thou shalt not
[16:28] avenge nor so thou shalt not
[16:30] bear any grudge and to bear a grudge it
[16:32] means to keep in mind or to
[16:34] keep in the word uh the word that's used
[16:37] there in the hebrew
[16:38] to bear any grudge it means to keep or
[16:39] to hold so to keep in mind or a memory
[16:42] of an offense
[16:44] so it's it needs to retain enmity so if
[16:46] somebody does you wrong you just
[16:48] always remember that i can't believe
[16:50] brother john wouldn't let me borrow a
[16:51] shovel it's just a shovel
[16:52] i actually gave him that shovel for his
[16:54] birthday and you just won't let it go
[16:57] you just let it keep eating at you let
[16:58] it keep bothering you and that's what it
[17:00] means to bear a grudge it means you keep
[17:02] it you hold it
[17:03] and so it's it has this sense of
[17:05] retaining this animosity or this
[17:07] bitterness or this offense in your heart
[17:09] and then in the sense that you would
[17:11] want to return the deed
[17:13] that if i ever get a chance oh i know he
[17:16] doesn't have a rake if he ever ever
[17:18] so much as hints that he wants a rake
[17:20] i'm calling him out
[17:26] but it says thou shalt not avenge nor
[17:28] bear any grudge against the children of
[17:30] thy people and in romans chapter 12
[17:31] verse 19
[17:32] paul is picking this very theme up he
[17:34] says dearly beloved avenge not
[17:36] yourselves
[17:37] but rather give place unto wrath for it
[17:40] is written
[17:40] vengeance is mine i will repay saith the
[17:44] lord
[17:45] and this is what god even inserts and he
[17:47] says i am the lord don't avenge don't
[17:49] bear grudge i am the lord
[17:50] and paul writes it in such a way not
[17:52] that we would want to have the wrong
[17:53] motive or
[17:54] rub our hands gleefully waiting for god
[17:56] to strike somebody with lightning
[17:58] but he's saying avenge not yourselves
[17:59] because if you avenge yourselves you
[18:01] take away the liberty of god to deal
[18:03] with the situation
[18:04] fine go ahead get your vengeance that
[18:06] just means i can't deal with it
[18:08] you muddy the picture up you confuse
[18:10] things god's not going to come behind
[18:12] your dealing with it and and vindicate
[18:14] your carnality vindicate your arrogance
[18:17] vindicate your vengeance or even your
[18:19] enmity but rather it says give place
[18:21] unto wrath for it is written vengeance
[18:22] is mine
[18:23] i will repay saith the lord let the lord
[18:26] deal with it
[18:27] avenge not yourselves james chapter 5
[18:30] verse 9 he says
[18:31] grudge not one against another brother
[18:34] lest ye be condemned
[18:35] behold the judge standeth before the
[18:38] door
[18:39] we're commanded very specifically to
[18:41] grudge not against
[18:42] another because it's our grudging that
[18:45] condemns us
[18:46] someone does harm if somebody lies if
[18:48] somebody hurts if somebody offends
[18:50] whatever
[18:50] whatever spectrum you might want to
[18:52] think about in a way that one would do
[18:53] you wrong or someone would do something
[18:55] that's not right
[18:56] or bring an offense or do something
[18:58] selfish or insensitive
[19:00] he's saying don't avenge yourselves and
[19:02] don't grudge once one against another
[19:04] because that person in their wrong by
[19:06] you bearing a grudge you
[19:07] yourself become condemned you could
[19:10] articulate all day long with quote in
[19:12] scripture this person did this he's
[19:13] worthy of hellfire this person did this
[19:15] they're worthy of judgment this person
[19:16] did this they ought to be kicked out of
[19:17] the church this person did this
[19:19] and you begin to grudge now who's
[19:21] condemned
[19:22] you become the one that's condemned not
[19:24] realizing even that that person you
[19:26] might even be a witness
[19:27] to something you're not even a party to
[19:29] it and you see person a do something
[19:31] wrong to person b
[19:32] and you get all worked up about it and
[19:33] you're running person a down and person
[19:35] a down and you're all
[19:36] you're holding a grudge against that
[19:38] person unbeknownst to you
[19:39] that person's made it right all is
[19:41] forgiven and guess who's the only person
[19:44] who's condemned
[19:45] the one grudging so he says don't grudge
[19:49] one another and
[19:52] in this as you see the bible says thou
[19:54] shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge we
[19:56] see the new testament
[19:57] picking up these principles and
[19:59] reinforcing them
[20:00] then in the old testament leviticus 19
[20:03] 18 the anecdote or the remedy
[20:05] to this avenging and grudging is but
[20:08] love thy neighbor
[20:09] as thyself so it says don't avenge and
[20:12] don't bear a grudge
[20:13] but do the opposite love them
[20:17] instead of seeking vengeance instead of
[20:19] retaining enmity instead of
[20:20] keeping your mind the offense or wanting
[20:22] to take vengeance or entertaining
[20:24] revengeful feelings love thy neighbor as
[20:27] thyself and i was thinking about this
[20:30] just
[20:30] there before services i was pondering it
[20:33] i was reminded how brother branham and
[20:35] he said does this in a couple places
[20:37] or he talks about taking the opposite or
[20:39] suggests this
[20:41] and he's asking the question how can you
[20:42] overcome a complex
[20:44] and brother branham just says take
[20:46] exactly the opposite
[20:49] and it's it's so simple it almost seems
[20:52] like
[20:53] did you did you understand the question
[20:54] i'm very selfish
[20:56] so how can i how can i stop being
[20:58] selfish and brother i'm just like oh if
[21:00] you're selfish just give things away
[21:02] he says take the vice versa if you're if
[21:05] you're if you're selfish just give
[21:08] now in to me this is instructed to the
[21:11] believer
[21:12] this is instructed to those who are
[21:14] filled with the holy ghost in other
[21:15] words he's saying listen
[21:16] dig down deep you've got it inside of
[21:19] you as a christian
[21:20] to do the opposite if you're selfish and
[21:24] not born again well
[21:25] that's to be expected but if you're a
[21:27] son or daughter of god
[21:28] and you have this complex of not wanting
[21:30] to give or you have you feel a certain
[21:32] way brother man says just
[21:33] just dig down deep tap into that
[21:35] reservoir of the holy ghost
[21:37] and do what it would want you to do
[21:38] yield to that he says just take exactly
[21:40] the opposite
[21:41] vice versa he says the remedy is in the
[21:42] anecdote
[21:44] and this is this is what comes to mind
[21:46] when i read this scripture
[21:47] you want revenge you want a grudge just
[21:49] love them
[21:51] and you're like well no that's the
[21:52] problem i i don't really love them look
[21:54] what they did to me and i really hold
[21:55] their grudge you said no
[21:57] love them don't love them from here
[21:59] don't love them in your head
[22:00] don't try to love them with your
[22:01] imagination conscious memory and
[22:03] affection
[22:04] but dig down deep find the love of god
[22:06] in your heart
[22:07] and find your place in scripture and
[22:09] then and exhibit that kind of love that
[22:11] the scripture would want you to hold
[22:14] love thy neighbor as thyself and this is
[22:16] a consistent principle in the scripture
[22:19] we read a couple wednesday nights ago in
[22:21] matthew 19 19 jesus bringing this thing
[22:23] this up in the commandments love thy
[22:25] neighbor as yourself
[22:26] he mentions it again in matthew chapter
[22:28] 22 verses 38 and 39
[22:30] there's two great commandments the
[22:32] second which is the which is like unto
[22:34] the first love the lord thy god the
[22:36] second one is
[22:37] love thy neighbor as thyself then in
[22:39] romans chapter 13
[22:42] verses 8 to 10 he says oh no man
[22:46] anything oh no man anything so don't owe
[22:50] anyone something
[22:51] but to love one another so owe no man
[22:54] anything
[22:54] but to love one another so it's no man
[22:57] it's all inclusive it's not
[22:59] uh carving out a niche of humanity
[23:03] uh oh nobody with the last name smith no
[23:05] it's just saying oh no man anything but
[23:07] to love one another
[23:08] for he that loveth another hath
[23:10] fulfilled the law
[23:12] for this thou shalt not commit adultery
[23:13] thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal
[23:15] thou shalt not bear false witness
[23:16] thou shalt not covet and if there be any
[23:18] other commandment it is briefly
[23:20] comprehended in this saying
[23:21] namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[23:24] thy
[23:25] self so very powerful paul is bringing
[23:28] this into the teaching to the romans
[23:30] talking about don't o man any man
[23:32] anything love one another
[23:34] if he that loveth one another fulfills
[23:36] the law and then he elicits these laws
[23:38] and he says now
[23:39] any laws briefly summed up in this
[23:41] commandment
[23:42] love thy neighbor as thyself love
[23:44] worketh no
[23:45] ill to his neighbor so if you're going
[23:48] to love
[23:49] your neighbor as yourself it works no
[23:52] ill
[23:52] towards them it says therefore love
[23:56] is fulfilling of the law
[23:59] so it's kind of it summarizes all of it
[24:01] even those things he
[24:02] mentions in verse 9 of thou shalt not
[24:04] commit thou shalt not kill that shall
[24:05] not steal
[24:06] he says love is fulfilling the law
[24:08] because if you
[24:09] had this thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[24:12] thyself
[24:13] then you would not covet your neighbor's
[24:14] wife if you love your
[24:16] neighbor as yourself then you would not
[24:17] kill you would not steal you would not
[24:19] bear false witness
[24:20] so it's the anecdote it's the remedy
[24:22] that if this love is really in your
[24:24] heart and being expressed it has a way
[24:26] of
[24:26] keeping you from giving yourself over to
[24:28] base carnal instincts of lust and anger
[24:31] and jealousy
[24:33] and then it's written in galatians
[24:34] chapter 5 verse 14
[24:37] for all the laws fulfilled in one word
[24:39] even this
[24:41] all the law this is paul writing to the
[24:42] galatians that the entire law can be
[24:44] summarized in this one saying
[24:46] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy
[24:49] self the entire law seemingly summed up
[24:52] in this
[24:53] so then you can see how jesus brought
[24:55] this to the rich young ruler to love thy
[24:57] neighbor as thyself he said this is
[24:59] that they'll do us well how he would
[25:01] elicit this great commandment liken unto
[25:03] the first
[25:04] how that even to this lawyer who comes
[25:06] and asked him this question
[25:07] he would say you've said well you've
[25:09] you've said good because now paul is
[25:10] saying
[25:11] that the entire law is fulfilled in the
[25:13] commandment thou shalt love thy neighbor
[25:15] as thyself
[25:17] now unless this if it feels like maybe
[25:20] by reading this i'm suggesting this is
[25:22] easy or like oh man this is just check
[25:24] the box if we could just do this we'll
[25:25] be fine
[25:26] the word is in in speaking to this paul
[25:29] you've been writing this a number of
[25:30] times
[25:31] jesus saying it even being placed in the
[25:33] law really what's happening is the word
[25:34] is cutting against our base
[25:36] instincts the word is just saying hey
[25:39] it's not natural for you to do this so
[25:42] it's cutting right against our carnal
[25:44] inclinations
[25:44] and our carnal mind and our carnal
[25:46] emotions are not intrinsically aligned
[25:48] with the word it's not instinctive
[25:51] we're not by nature in harmony with this
[25:53] love thy neighbor as thyself
[25:55] but yet it's just rooted in our human
[25:57] nature to kind of have a bent towards
[25:59] someone or to
[26:00] easily be jealous or when you see
[26:01] somebody else blessed sometimes you
[26:03] think well what about me
[26:06] very rarely do you see children when
[26:07] somebody else gets the bigger piece
[26:09] they're like
[26:10] right on man that's exactly what i
[26:13] wanted i'm so glad you got that
[26:15] no it's usually like uh mom
[26:19] his piece is twice as big as mine and
[26:21] it's not instinctive even in our
[26:23] children it's not
[26:24] instinctive like oh that's he gets to go
[26:27] with you and i don't
[26:28] that's awesome go for it buddy have fun
[26:32] it's always why don't we get to have a
[26:34] friend over
[26:35] why don't we get to go out why don't it
[26:37] because it's just in our nature
[26:39] and so when the bible says love thy
[26:41] neighbor as thyself the word is just
[26:43] cutting right against
[26:44] the the our weaknesses as humans
[26:48] now as we've been
[26:52] as we read from leviticus 19 notice how
[26:55] it says thou shalt not avenge nor bear
[26:56] any grudge against
[26:57] the children of thy people but love but
[27:01] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[27:04] and so this is i want to identify this
[27:06] phrase because
[27:07] this is where i could look back and see
[27:10] written in the old testament where this
[27:12] lawyer may have tried to find his
[27:14] justification
[27:15] because it says thou shalt not avenge or
[27:17] bear grudge against the children of
[27:19] thy people so the lawyer is like
[27:23] well then who is my neighbor and the
[27:26] jews interpreted neighbor
[27:28] very narrowly in their definition of
[27:31] neighbor it did not include the
[27:33] samaritans
[27:34] to a jew a definition of neighbor did
[27:36] not include the gentiles
[27:37] a neighbor meant only an israelite
[27:41] so to you it would say thou shalt not
[27:43] avenge against an israelite nor bear any
[27:45] grudge against the israelites but thou
[27:47] shalt love
[27:47] an israelite as thyself and that's how
[27:50] they would construe the law it meant any
[27:52] israelite
[27:52] either one from the same nation or one
[27:55] of the same religion
[27:57] because you could be a neighbor of the
[27:58] same nation you're related by blood
[28:00] it would be called a neighbor in nature
[28:03] we are of our father abraham of our
[28:05] father
[28:06] isaac and jacob and we're of israel
[28:08] we're children of israel
[28:09] so because we descend from israel we are
[28:12] considering ourselves
[28:13] neighbors because we're neighbors by
[28:15] blood were neighbors in nature
[28:18] but then they would also have a category
[28:20] of people that would be neighbors of the
[28:21] same religion
[28:22] or one who professed to believe the jews
[28:25] faith that would be a proselyte or
[28:26] convert to the jewish faith and that
[28:28] would be a neighbor in
[28:30] law and so they would consider one who
[28:32] has converted
[28:33] from a and and profess the faith of the
[28:36] gen
[28:36] the jews they would consider that one
[28:38] now to be a neighbor
[28:40] because even though they're not blood
[28:42] they've converted and they profess the
[28:43] run
[28:44] one true god so to a jew if you said
[28:47] neighbor you would either have to be
[28:48] related by blood
[28:49] or you would have had denied your idols
[28:52] turned your back on your own family your
[28:54] own blood your own kindred
[28:55] and converted to their religion and to
[28:57] be of the same religion
[28:59] and the the pharisees the sadducees the
[29:02] lawyer here they found support
[29:04] and their own written law and in their
[29:06] oral tradition
[29:08] they would have found it here in
[29:09] leviticus 19 18 not against the children
[29:12] of thy people there's even a phrase i
[29:14] came across
[29:15] in the oral tradition they had where it
[29:17] says when a man sees a gentile fall into
[29:19] the sea
[29:20] he need not take him up so if you saw a
[29:23] gentile drowning
[29:25] you would have no obligation under the
[29:27] law to
[29:28] save them or rescue them while they're
[29:30] drowning
[29:31] now lest you confuse the jewish law with
[29:34] our own law
[29:34] you would have a duty imposed upon you
[29:36] by law that if you saw someone drowning
[29:38] that you would have an obligation or
[29:40] some responsibility to rescue them if
[29:42] you do not put yourself in peril
[29:44] just under own natural laws and so there
[29:48] is
[29:48] when i say natural law even our code
[29:51] whether it be civil or criminal there
[29:53] are certain statues that would obligate
[29:54] you to render aid to someone regardless
[29:56] if they were a jew or not
[29:58] could you imagine if someone was in need
[30:00] and you bypassed them you didn't help
[30:02] them and you
[30:02] and you're charged later you go well
[30:04] they didn't believe the message
[30:08] why was i supposed to stop clearly they
[30:10] weren't a believer
[30:12] and they wouldn't go um yeah we didn't
[30:13] consider that they don't believe like
[30:14] you oh well you know what
[30:16] sorry to bother it wouldn't work that
[30:18] way
[30:19] and so the pharisees they regarded only
[30:22] jews as their neighbor
[30:23] they did not believe that the law
[30:24] obligated to them them to gentiles
[30:27] so the lawyer saw himself as innocent
[30:30] because in his mind
[30:31] the law did not require him to love
[30:33] samaritans
[30:34] the law did not require him to love the
[30:36] gentiles the law only required him
[30:38] to love the jews or to love a proselyte
[30:41] someone who had
[30:42] converted and that was his justification
[30:46] as it says him willing to justify
[30:48] himself he said and who is my neighbor
[30:50] because he would narrowly define those
[30:52] to whom he would have been obligated to
[30:53] love
[30:54] now i want to uh just kind of put the
[30:57] light on you
[30:59] up upon what basis do we seek the same
[31:03] justification
[31:04] and just uh be honest with yourself
[31:07] right now perhaps let the word search
[31:08] your heart
[31:11] how do we justify our own
[31:14] uh uh our own biases our own prejudices
[31:19] our own criticisms
[31:20] how is it we justify even our own
[31:22] disdain or anger
[31:24] or animosity do we
[31:27] do we hold in our own hearts that a
[31:29] neighbor is one who's related to me
[31:31] by blood only that my obligation extends
[31:34] to my family
[31:35] am i immediately family my extended
[31:37] family those that are related to me by
[31:39] blood
[31:40] or we say well brother aaron that's
[31:42] that's too narrow would we actually
[31:44] just use have this principle govern us
[31:47] only as long as it relates to those who
[31:49] profess to believe the message
[31:52] that my neighbor is one who believes the
[31:54] message
[31:55] one who believes maybe uh in the message
[31:58] that we believe and we would have a very
[31:59] strict definition of that
[32:01] and because of that maybe it's really
[32:02] only one who believes the message
[32:04] as i believe it so it wouldn't even be
[32:07] just somebody who believes god sent a
[32:08] prophet but it would be
[32:09] only if you believe that god sent a
[32:11] prophet and that he taught xyz
[32:14] and if you don't believe it just that
[32:15] way then you're really not my neighbor
[32:16] how is it that we begin then
[32:18] to justify our attitudes our judgments
[32:21] uh our
[32:22] our biases our prejudices all these
[32:24] different things that we might have
[32:27] against somebody even our oughts or even
[32:29] our criticisms
[32:30] how is it that we justify it is our
[32:33] neighbor
[32:34] only those who have not hurt me or
[32:36] offended me
[32:38] is my neighbor only those who've been
[32:40] good to me
[32:42] do i feel justified in my bitterness do
[32:45] i feel justified in my grudging
[32:47] because someone has offended me or
[32:48] because of my differences with somebody
[32:50] else
[32:51] that merely because one does not believe
[32:53] the way you do you can justify
[32:56] a wrong attitude towards them where you
[32:59] might even begin to feel
[33:00] experience a feeling of anger animosity
[33:02] or even disdain
[33:04] whatever the feeling might be but then
[33:05] you realize you know what they don't
[33:06] even believe like i do
[33:08] and because you can turn your emotions
[33:10] around and just try to put a stamp on it
[33:12] well this is just righteous indignation
[33:16] and and just trying to attribute it to
[33:17] the fact that there's difference of
[33:19] opinion
[33:19] there's differences in the way that you
[33:21] believe things
[33:23] and it reminds me this is something
[33:25] that's been
[33:26] uh very very heavy on my heart over the
[33:28] past year or this year at least
[33:31] how that when the children of israel
[33:33] they sent out spies
[33:34] 12 men to go into the promised land and
[33:37] spy out the promised land
[33:39] and when the 12 spies came back after 40
[33:41] days of search and they came back and
[33:42] they said
[33:43] we saw the land it was just exactly the
[33:45] way that we said it you said it was
[33:47] flowing with milk and honey this is the
[33:48] fruit of it they had all the fruits of
[33:50] it but then they said there's strong men
[33:52] that dwell in that land and we saw the
[33:54] children of enoch we saw the amalekites
[33:56] we saw all the ones that
[33:57] dwelled there and as they're bringing up
[33:59] this negative report it suggested yes
[34:01] the land is good here's the evidence
[34:03] but those that live in the land are too
[34:06] great for us
[34:08] and if you could just picture 10 men
[34:10] they're saying listen they're too big
[34:12] they're too big they're too big
[34:13] and that's what's suggested by the
[34:14] language they're using in numbers 13
[34:17] verses 26 to 29 but then
[34:20] caleb the dog the gentile
[34:23] he stilled the people before moses and
[34:26] said notice his language
[34:28] let us go up at once and possess it for
[34:31] we
[34:32] are well able to overcome it now notice
[34:35] caleb didn't say
[34:36] let me and joshua go because the rest of
[34:40] these guys
[34:41] are knuckleheads let
[34:44] joshua and caleb go up with our people
[34:47] because the rest
[34:48] of these guys are make believers at best
[34:50] unbelievers most likely
[34:51] they have they only believe the opening
[34:53] of the word they don't even believe the
[34:54] prophet really
[34:55] really look come on really guys get a
[34:57] dna test how could you even be jews
[35:00] he said no no no guys you've got it all
[35:01] wrong we are able
[35:03] notice he used we he said us caleb was
[35:06] willing to put his arm around the ten
[35:09] who just began to speak against the
[35:11] promise and say no brother
[35:12] we're able and then the sin
[35:16] and the heir of the ten was not that
[35:18] they didn't believe they could
[35:19] they could take it but it says but then
[35:20] the men went up with him
[35:22] and said we be not able to go up against
[35:25] the people for they are stronger
[35:27] than we and their heir wasn't
[35:31] in believing they were stronger their
[35:32] heir wasn't believing that they weren't
[35:34] able to go up against it the air was in
[35:36] believing that joshua and caleb couldn't
[35:38] the heir was made manifest and they
[35:40] brought all the other 11 down
[35:42] just for one to say well i'm not a very
[35:44] good fighter there's no way i could whip
[35:46] them
[35:46] or my tribe we're just not that
[35:48] experienced but i don't think we can
[35:50] what they did
[35:51] is they brought everyone else down and
[35:52] said if i can't you can't either
[35:56] and that was the sin that was the air
[35:58] that's manifest here in numbers chapter
[36:00] 13.
[36:00] it wasn't that one felt weak or one felt
[36:03] unable but it was that the other person
[36:04] brought the other one down
[36:07] where was the strength of caleb to even
[36:09] look at the very ones who said they
[36:10] couldn't
[36:11] and say yes you can
[36:14] but but i don't think i can i don't
[36:15] think i said yes you can
[36:18] and that's why i believe that we can
[36:19] look upon somebody
[36:21] someone who may not believe what we
[36:22] believe and we and we don't water down
[36:25] the truth we don't change it to satisfy
[36:26] someone who looks at something something
[36:28] differently
[36:28] but we call someone brother not because
[36:31] they believe what we believe
[36:33] and or not because we're not convinced
[36:35] of what we believe but because we
[36:36] believe that they can believe also
[36:40] we can call him brother we can call him
[36:42] sister not because we're watering down
[36:43] what we believe but we can believe
[36:45] i'm a son they could be a son too i'm a
[36:48] daughter they can be a daughter too
[36:49] i can possess it they can possess it too
[36:52] and we change our language not because
[36:54] we're weak not because we're changing
[36:55] what we believe or watering it down or
[36:57] thinking well it doesn't matter how
[36:58] you're baptized
[36:59] but we believe that they can come to an
[37:01] understanding of how to be baptized
[37:02] too praise the lord
[37:09] and so in this thought as we're
[37:11] challenging our
[37:13] perceptions and our attitudes and how we
[37:15] seek to justify ourselves
[37:17] on a particular basis do i make someone
[37:20] my enemy
[37:21] to justify my criticisms
[37:24] to justify my gossip to justify my
[37:26] hatred
[37:29] and part of the inspiration when the
[37:31] lord began to lay this upon my heart
[37:35] back in june when
[37:39] and it was just almost immediately when
[37:41] the lord
[37:43] was commissioning us and calling us to
[37:45] come here and start a church and this is
[37:47] it's just personal for us here at
[37:49] arizona believers
[37:51] immediately he laid upon my heart in the
[37:53] beginning
[37:54] god created the heaven and the earth and
[37:57] then immediately
[37:58] who is thy neighbor and these things
[38:00] began to be so heavy upon my heart as i
[38:02] pondered them
[38:04] and what this this unction that came
[38:06] behind this thought of who is my
[38:08] neighbor
[38:09] was how that it was it's often said by
[38:11] about brother branham and his brother
[38:13] billy paul i believe who shares the
[38:14] testimony and that's where we derive
[38:15] this from
[38:17] but he says one of the most outstanding
[38:18] characteristics about brother branham is
[38:20] you could not tell brother branham's
[38:21] friends from his enemies
[38:24] so in word and deed you would not be
[38:27] able to discern
[38:28] foe or from friend now ponder that think
[38:32] about that
[38:33] one of the most outstanding
[38:34] characteristics about brother branham is
[38:36] you
[38:36] you could not tell who his friend was
[38:38] and who his enemy was
[38:40] not that he didn't know
[38:43] be but that you would not know
[38:46] by his conduct or his conversation you
[38:49] would not know
[38:51] who his friend was and who his enemy was
[38:54] and the story is even told how that
[38:56] brother branham was asked to be a part
[38:57] of a meeting
[38:58] and brother branham is sitting there
[39:00] he's just on the other side of this
[39:01] curtain waiting to be called out
[39:02] and the pastor gets up at this great
[39:04] meeting he says after he's taken up the
[39:06] offering and everything he says
[39:07] brother branham was not able to be with
[39:09] us at this time he was called away
[39:11] we're very sorry and then just off the
[39:13] side of the platform
[39:14] there's brother branham sitting there
[39:18] and and the brother says to brother
[39:19] branham brother branham
[39:21] can you believe this and i'm sorry if i
[39:23] get the exact words right it definitely
[39:24] is a game of telephone at this point
[39:27] and brother he says brother branham why
[39:29] don't you just correct it right now
[39:32] all brother brandon would have to do is
[39:33] take a few steps
[39:35] he wouldn't even have to go all the way
[39:36] to the platform and push the push the
[39:38] pastor out the way and say
[39:39] i'm here what were you thinking all he'd
[39:42] have to do is just maybe look out the
[39:43] curtains
[39:44] be like just enough maybe not for
[39:47] everybody but just a few
[39:48] just step over into the peripheral just
[39:50] enough to see a few people go
[39:54] just enough just for a few and and we
[39:58] would think maybe he'd be justified in
[39:59] exposing this kind of lie what kind of
[40:01] heresy is this
[40:02] and you know what brother brown's
[40:03] response was oh and do that to him in
[40:06] front of his people
[40:07] i could i couldn't do that how about the
[40:11] think about the the depth of thought to
[40:13] that
[40:15] how that here was one that instinctively
[40:17] we could say that man deserves to be
[40:19] exposed
[40:21] but brother branham realizes if that man
[40:23] is exposed untimely what would it do to
[40:25] a young convert
[40:27] what would it do to the people who are
[40:28] looking to this man who even have
[40:29] confidence in him
[40:30] because he invited brother branham to
[40:32] come out what kind of confusion would
[40:34] that so to just so instinctively try to
[40:36] rip something open expose it call it out
[40:37] for what it is
[40:39] say oh in front of his people no i
[40:41] couldn't do that
[40:43] and so with brother branham he had a
[40:44] testimony that you could not tell
[40:47] his friends from his enemies and that's
[40:50] that ought to inspire us
[40:53] you would not want somebody to be so
[40:55] easily say well
[40:56] i know exactly who he hates and i know
[40:58] who he likes
[41:00] you you'd want you'd want to have the
[41:02] kind of testosterone says well manny you
[41:03] you'd think he's friends with everybody
[41:05] you think he gets along with everybody
[41:08] and now as we go further in this and
[41:11] what i
[41:11] how the lord's inspired me in this
[41:13] looking at this subject of the
[41:15] the parable of the good samaritan you
[41:17] might be asking brother aaron when are
[41:18] you going to get to the parable
[41:20] well i'm trying to just take what what
[41:22] has spoken to us
[41:24] from it and just maybe look outside of
[41:26] it
[41:27] and if the lord would have us to look
[41:29] into it more specifically we will do a
[41:30] little bit tonight
[41:32] we can do so because there's so many
[41:34] things that are uh very instructive to
[41:36] us how we could look at
[41:37] how the relationship of this man that
[41:38] went down from jericho what it would
[41:40] have been to a priest
[41:41] what would it would have been to the
[41:42] levite the relationships between these
[41:45] people or even among them
[41:46] and there's a lot of different ways to
[41:47] look at it but the answer that jesus
[41:50] gives in the parable of the good
[41:51] samaritan
[41:53] it's a rebuttal to her it opposes this
[41:55] lawyer's position
[41:56] that his neighbor is only a jew
[42:00] could you see that now that what jesus
[42:02] has done is he's refuted what's in this
[42:04] lawyer's mind
[42:05] that when he says well who is my
[42:07] neighbor jesus can understand now
[42:09] that this lawyer is going to have a very
[42:10] narrow definition of what a neighbor is
[42:12] and he's going to take the position
[42:13] that a neighbor is a jew or one who's
[42:15] converted to judaism and so jesus gives
[42:17] him an answer that refutes that
[42:21] because your neighbor even for us your
[42:22] neighbor is more than blood relation
[42:25] your neighbor is more than just
[42:27] doctrinal affiliation or agreement
[42:29] within doctrine
[42:30] it's more than just doctrinal
[42:31] association or affinity within the
[42:33] things you believe your neighbor is more
[42:34] than blood it's more than belief
[42:38] the very greek word that's used in the
[42:39] scripture for neighbor means one
[42:41] who is near in the english the
[42:43] anglo-saxon it means
[42:44] he who is next and so the lord
[42:48] answers the lord's answer as he gives
[42:51] this parable
[42:52] it frames the issue within this context
[42:55] that someone is in need or distress
[42:59] because there's it's it's not being
[43:03] there there's nothing in the word that
[43:05] would require you to go beyond the word
[43:08] does that sound like a dust statement
[43:10] you know the word won't ask you to
[43:12] deny the word they won't ask won't ask
[43:13] you to to break the word
[43:16] so the to the love thy neighbor as
[43:18] thyself
[43:19] it's not creating this commandment that
[43:20] then usurps every other commandment
[43:23] that i'm loving my neighbor therefore
[43:25] i'm going to abandon conviction i'm
[43:27] going to abandon
[43:28] steadfastness i'm going to abandon
[43:29] obedience well i guess i've got to love
[43:31] my neighbor
[43:32] so i'm just not going to be holy today
[43:35] it's not he's not there's nothing in
[43:37] this word that's going to suggest you to
[43:39] go outside the bounds of the word
[43:41] but jesus does take this parable of the
[43:45] good samaritan
[43:46] and he places it in context of asking
[43:48] yourself who's your neighbor
[43:50] when someone is in need or distress
[43:53] because he asked the question after he
[43:54] kind of goes through the story in verse
[43:56] 36 which now of these three
[43:58] the levite the priest or the samaritan
[44:01] which one of these these three do you
[44:03] think
[44:04] was a neighbor unto him that fell among
[44:06] the thieves
[44:08] so jesus's question is not identifying
[44:11] who will neighbor you
[44:13] and using it as a verb who will neighbor
[44:15] you who will be a
[44:16] neighbor to you but rather his question
[44:18] is who will you neighbor
[44:20] so it's not that he's asking us well who
[44:22] will we let be a neighbor to us who will
[44:24] neighbor you
[44:25] who is going to give to you who's going
[44:27] to serve you who's going to take care of
[44:29] you but rather
[44:29] who will you be a neighbor to who will
[44:32] you
[44:33] neighbor who will you help and their
[44:35] need or their distress
[44:38] because he's he's he's narrowing this
[44:40] down do we only know do we only owe a
[44:42] duty
[44:43] to do good to our family do we only owe
[44:47] a duty to do good to our friends
[44:52] do we only owe a duty to help the same
[44:55] when they're in need
[44:56] that i'll help a friend out if he's
[44:57] hurting i'll help a family member out if
[44:59] he's hurting
[45:00] because what jesus identifies in this
[45:02] parable the good samaritan is that the
[45:04] duty that we owe
[45:05] to a needy neighbor to someone in need
[45:08] disregards nationality
[45:10] it disregards religion it disregards
[45:13] kindred
[45:14] in other words it does not take into
[45:16] account are we related it does not take
[45:18] into account do we believe the same
[45:19] thing
[45:20] it does not take into account are we of
[45:21] the same faith or same nationality
[45:24] jesus is actually espousing in this
[45:26] parable that look the one who was
[45:28] neighbor to the one who was hurt was the
[45:30] one who disregarded the faith
[45:32] disregarded the nationality disregarded
[45:34] the blood relation
[45:35] and when he saw a fellow man in need he
[45:38] instinctively acted to see that he was
[45:40] taken care of
[45:42] so jesus is identifying that we when we
[45:44] see somebody in need
[45:46] and we see a need that we can meet
[45:49] then we ought to meet it and not go
[45:51] through this rationalization of are they
[45:53] worthy do they believe the same
[45:54] are they related of what segment of
[45:56] society they belong in
[45:58] and then if we could find some mark
[45:59] against them say well i would have
[46:01] helped them but i know who they voted
[46:03] for in the last election
[46:04] and they're just getting what's coming
[46:05] to them
[46:08] and if you will ponder this because i i
[46:10] you you maybe you hear that and it seems
[46:13] just uh it seems very obvious but it
[46:16] just struck me so heavy earlier today
[46:18] and i thought well yes
[46:19] yes think it just became a revelation to
[46:22] me
[46:22] if we begin to divide among who we're
[46:25] willing to help
[46:26] in these things then it'll naturally
[46:29] carry over in who we think
[46:30] is worthy of the gospel it'll naturally
[46:33] carry over into who we pray for in
[46:35] believing
[46:36] naturally carry over to who we believe
[46:38] it can be and receive salvation
[46:40] and how else could we fulfill our great
[46:42] commission if we discriminate or judge
[46:44] carnally
[46:47] jesus saying is you do good unto those
[46:49] and you help the needy the oppressed
[46:51] the the broken the hurting help them if
[46:54] you have what they need
[46:56] help them and take care of them and do
[46:58] it regardless of their faith regardless
[46:59] of their background regardless
[47:01] of their nationality regardless of blood
[47:03] relation and be instinctive in doing so
[47:05] when you see somebody who needs mercy
[47:08] because how could we ever fulfill the
[47:10] great commission that the church has
[47:12] given
[47:12] if it's instinctive for us to judge
[47:14] carnally and discern who we
[47:16] carnally discern who we think we can
[47:17] help and who we can't
[47:20] by no means suggestion that we would
[47:22] ever cast our pearls before swine or not
[47:24] use wisdom
[47:25] or discretion and things that we say and
[47:27] do but we're attacking the heart of
[47:28] prejudice we're attacking the heart of
[47:30] bias
[47:30] we're attacking these value judgments
[47:32] and assessments we make in our minds
[47:34] when we deem some people worthy and
[47:36] others not
[47:38] when we're quick quick to criticize some
[47:41] and tear down
[47:42] others but then we're blind to things
[47:45] that we might have
[47:46] weaknesses ourselves listen to the great
[47:48] commission
[47:49] and just imagine if we weren't
[47:51] instructed by the word
[47:52] to lay aside these kind of these
[47:54] differences when someone is needy and
[47:56] someone is in help
[47:57] and deserves mercy needs mercy because a
[47:59] sinner needs mercy
[48:01] just as much as this one who is coming
[48:03] down from jerusalem to jericho
[48:05] just as much as this one needed mercy so
[48:08] does a sinner need mercy so does a
[48:10] backslidden person need mercy
[48:11] and if you would look at this one who is
[48:13] laying in the ditch and say well i have
[48:15] all these reasons for not doing it
[48:17] then that same thought process would
[48:19] enter in when you see someone
[48:20] who needs the mercy of this message
[48:23] needs the grace of this message you will
[48:25] just instinctively
[48:26] bury it hide it walk around them avoid
[48:28] them
[48:30] the great commission listen to it he
[48:32] said unto them mark chapter 16 verses 15
[48:34] to 18
[48:34] go ye into all the world
[48:39] except those nations that are no all the
[48:42] world
[48:42] and preach the gospel to
[48:45] every creature that is 5 eight and above
[48:49] no such qualification i think i put five
[48:52] eight if they ask me my height i
[48:54] guarantee you i'm probably short of that
[48:55] but i just round up
[49:00] it reminds me that the sheepdog who
[49:03] could talk
[49:04] and the the farmer told him to go round
[49:08] up the sheep and so he did he came back
[49:09] and said how many were there and he said
[49:10] 40 and the farmer said i thought there
[49:11] was 39. he said you asked me to round
[49:13] them up
[49:17] he says go into all the world and preach
[49:18] the gospel to every creature
[49:21] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[49:23] be saved
[49:24] he that believeth not shall be damned
[49:27] it's according to their faith it's
[49:28] according to their reception
[49:30] it has nothing to do with our
[49:31] perceptions of people and these
[49:33] signs shall follow them that believe in
[49:36] my name they shall cast out devils
[49:38] no qualification as to which ones you're
[49:40] casting out they shall speak with new
[49:42] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[49:44] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[49:46] not hurt them
[49:46] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[49:49] they shall
[49:50] recover how is it we could fulfill the
[49:54] great commission
[49:55] if we have some prejudice in our mind
[49:57] some faulty judgment in our mind
[49:58] some kind of filter or factor that we
[50:00] use when we assess someone's worth or
[50:02] whether or not
[50:03] they they deserve mercy or whether or
[50:04] not they should be ministered to
[50:06] how could we go into all the world and
[50:07] preach to every creature lay hands on
[50:09] the sick and cast out devils
[50:11] if we cannot get it right to love our
[50:14] neighbor
[50:15] as ourselves i found this statement in
[50:18] one of the commentaries and i just will
[50:20] read it exactly as i found it
[50:22] you ought to ask who wants my help
[50:25] i thought that was very good ask
[50:26] yourself who wants my help
[50:28] neighborhood consists not in what you
[50:30] receive but in what you give
[50:33] it is independent of race creed and the
[50:35] ordinary sentiment of pity
[50:37] love overleaps over leaps all these
[50:40] distinctions
[50:40] and risk its very life in order to
[50:43] render help
[50:45] that's powerful neighborhood being
[50:48] neighborly loving your neighbors
[50:49] yourself
[50:49] consist not in what you can get from
[50:51] them but in what you can give to them
[50:54] it's independent of race and creed or
[50:56] just even normal sentiments of
[50:58] of kindness and pity but rather it's
[51:00] something that love
[51:01] the love of god constrains you the love
[51:03] of god motivates you
[51:07] in leviticus chapter 19 verse 18 we read
[51:09] how it says thou shalt not avenge nor
[51:11] bear any grudge
[51:12] against the children of thy people but
[51:14] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[51:16] i am the lord
[51:18] we speculated that maybe this lawyer
[51:20] might have found his justification
[51:22] this very verse that well it says
[51:23] against the children of thy people
[51:25] i believe it could be proved that the
[51:27] jews the pharisees this lawyer narrowly
[51:29] construed what it meant to be a neighbor
[51:31] to those who were of the household of
[51:33] faith to those
[51:34] who were jews but in verse 33 of
[51:37] leviticus 19
[51:39] verses 33 to 34 it says and if a
[51:43] stranger's soul journe with thee in your
[51:45] land
[51:47] ye shall not vex him so now it takes a
[51:51] stranger stranger would be a
[51:53] a gentile samaritan a reprobate a
[51:55] heathen those who are
[51:56] outside of the faith ones that were not
[51:58] born of the children of israel
[52:00] if there's a stranger living in your
[52:02] land don't vex him
[52:04] don't harass him don't trouble him don't
[52:06] even constantly remind him where he
[52:08] comes from
[52:10] this is what the scripture is telling us
[52:11] don't vex him but
[52:13] the stranger that dwelleth with you
[52:16] shall be unto you as
[52:18] one one born among you
[52:21] and thou shalt love him as thy self
[52:25] it completely demolishes this very
[52:27] narrow view of what what a
[52:29] a neighbor is oh well it's only a jew
[52:31] it's only one who's converted to our
[52:32] religion no
[52:33] if a stranger dwells in your land then
[52:36] treat him like one who's born among you
[52:37] love him as yourself then it says for ye
[52:40] were strangers in the land of egypt i am
[52:42] the lord your god
[52:44] have you not forgotten that you were
[52:46] strangers once yourself in egypt
[52:49] when you find one who's fallen and one
[52:51] who's overtaken in a fault ye
[52:53] are spiritual restore such a one and
[52:55] meekness and fear
[52:56] considering your own selves remember
[52:59] that you at one time may
[53:00] we were fallen you at one time were
[53:02] broken and someone had
[53:04] care upon you and reached out to you and
[53:06] restored you and showed kindness of you
[53:08] and he said listen
[53:09] remember one time you were strangers in
[53:11] a land and you received kindness from
[53:13] the egyptians
[53:15] he's saying don't even regard what they
[53:16] did to you in the end
[53:19] remember one time you were a stranger
[53:21] remember what it felt like
[53:23] remember the fears you had remember the
[53:24] abuse you endured
[53:26] remember what you went through jesus
[53:27] said whatever god's saying whatever you
[53:28] do don't perpetuate the cycle
[53:30] ye who are abused don't become the
[53:32] abuser you who are rejected don't become
[53:34] the rejecter
[53:35] you who've endured it you know what it
[53:36] feels like change it and become
[53:38] empathetic
[53:39] if you know what it's like to be
[53:40] rejected then become one who reaches out
[53:42] if you know what it's like to be one
[53:43] who's abused and comfort the one who's
[53:45] abused
[53:45] don't become the abuser don't because
[53:48] the one that because i was treated this
[53:50] way i'm going to treat those because
[53:51] i've been rejected i'm going to reject
[53:53] because you won't fellowship with me i
[53:54] won't fellowship with you
[53:57] that's vengeance but the very law right
[54:01] then the very same chapter says don't
[54:03] vex him
[54:04] the stranger who lives with you who's
[54:06] not a jew
[54:07] who doesn't profess your faith treat him
[54:10] as one who's born among you
[54:12] treat him like a brother and love him as
[54:15] yourself
[54:16] in other words even the one who's
[54:18] amongst you who is not your blood
[54:20] and not your brother in the faith love
[54:23] them as a neighbor
[54:25] love them as yourself treat them as one
[54:29] who's born among you
[54:32] and if you pondered in light of what we
[54:33] mentioned a moment ago about the great
[54:34] commission how could israel bring
[54:36] strangers
[54:37] to the knowledge of the one true god to
[54:38] the worship of the one true god
[54:40] if they always mistreated them
[54:43] how many candidates would they have
[54:46] to to be converted how many would be
[54:49] willing to believe in this one true god
[54:51] if they were always vexed they were
[54:54] treated as an
[54:54] outcast it was even put in terms now
[54:57] listen i could love you
[54:58] but you need to convert first
[55:02] i would let you borrow my rake if you
[55:04] were baptized in the name of the lord
[55:06] jesus christ
[55:06] but
[55:10] so how would that go over in in what the
[55:12] word is teaching these israelites
[55:14] teaching the jews how could they ever
[55:16] bring one
[55:16] to desire the the to serve the one true
[55:19] god
[55:20] if those who believed in the one true
[55:22] god are always mistreating everybody
[55:24] who doesn't believe in the one true god
[55:26] you know what most people say i don't
[55:27] want any of that
[55:29] if that's what their god turns them into
[55:32] then i don't want that
[55:33] and that's what turns a lot of people
[55:35] away from so-called christianity
[55:37] and the christ we serve is because the
[55:39] people who claim to believe in him
[55:41] mistreat other people and in doing so
[55:44] profane the name of christ
[55:48] i was singing a song today be salty
[55:52] or i'm salty i'm not remembering the
[55:54] words just exactly right
[55:56] i'm salty and i thought it's really a
[56:00] paradox
[56:02] because to today if you're salty
[56:06] you're uh you're bitter you're harsh
[56:07] you're cruel
[56:09] but it says you're the salt of the earth
[56:10] i took this out of my notes and i'm
[56:12] still
[56:12] preaching it anyway so who knows where
[56:14] we're gonna end up now
[56:16] i thought maybe we would give it more
[56:18] time so i'll just kind of lay these
[56:19] seeds in there
[56:20] maybe wet your appetite a little bit you
[56:22] are the salt of the earth
[56:25] if the salt loses its savior how's the
[56:27] earth gonna ever be salted
[56:29] where's the preservation where's the
[56:31] curing where's the healing
[56:32] if the bride and the elect can't be
[56:35] salty
[56:36] the only thing that's left is for the
[56:37] world to be salty
[56:40] don't be salty be salty don't be salty
[56:43] like
[56:44] the world be salty like christ tells us
[56:46] to be
[56:48] that it would make somebody thirsty i
[56:49] was reading all these places
[56:51] it came up so often when brother bran is
[56:52] being asked in question and answers
[56:54] things about unbelievers he was like
[56:55] just be salty
[56:56] i got a husband that doesn't believe
[56:58] just be salty i have a friend that i
[57:00] really want to know the truth just be
[57:01] salty
[57:03] that doesn't mean in our parlance today
[57:05] have an attitude
[57:07] he says don't push anything on them be
[57:09] salty how can you be salty
[57:11] love them as yourself
[57:17] in luke chapter 10 now we'll read a
[57:18] portion of this verses 30-32
[57:22] notice this as we're talking about being
[57:24] salty about how
[57:25] love the stranger that dwells with you
[57:27] as yourself
[57:28] go into all the world and preach the
[57:30] gospel to every creature
[57:32] thinking about this duty that we oh man
[57:34] all men fellow men those who are in need
[57:35] we have a duty to those or need to give
[57:38] them something if we have what they need
[57:40] to help them i believe that requires
[57:42] some maturity and some wisdom
[57:44] but notice it says in luke chapter 10
[57:46] verses 30 to 32
[57:48] in direct answering now to who is thy
[57:50] neighbor he says a
[57:51] certain man went down from jerusalem to
[57:54] jericho
[57:55] brother bam identified this as a man
[57:57] going down from where he ought to be to
[57:59] jericho which represents the world
[58:01] this is someone who's backsliding says
[58:03] and fell among thieves which stripped
[58:04] him of his raiment and wounded him
[58:06] and departed leaving him half dead
[58:09] so this is the condition of this one
[58:11] who's going down from jerusalem
[58:13] if we put it in terms that this is a jew
[58:15] who's backslid
[58:17] then we might say well it serves him
[58:19] right that he would fall among thieves
[58:20] be stripped
[58:21] and wounded and left half dead because
[58:23] he left jerusalem he was taking a
[58:25] dangerous way
[58:26] what would you expect he gets what he
[58:28] deserved we might just call it karma
[58:32] then it's peculiar in that it says and
[58:34] by chance there came down
[58:36] a certain priest that way so if we're
[58:38] seeing if he's taken the same path could
[58:40] it be that this is a backslidden priest
[58:45] and he gets lucky he doesn't fall among
[58:47] thieves
[58:48] but as he's taken the same path of the
[58:50] jew who went down from jerusalem
[58:52] to jericho and i think it's kind of
[58:54] assumed that it would be a man of faith
[58:55] or a jew
[58:56] it says when he came by chance by where
[58:59] as came a certain priest
[59:00] that way when he saw him he passed by on
[59:03] the other side
[59:05] so now the priest is taking the same
[59:07] path and when he sees this one in need
[59:10] sees one who's harmed he just steps away
[59:12] and passes by the other side
[59:14] and who knows what's going through his
[59:15] head when he does so
[59:18] and likewise verse 32 and likewise a
[59:21] levite
[59:21] now there's something we can learn from
[59:23] scripture here not every levite's a
[59:25] priest
[59:27] and that's so in the old testament not
[59:29] every levite entered into the priesthood
[59:31] but there were levites who were called
[59:32] to serve in the temple that wouldn't
[59:34] necessarily be priests so when you see
[59:35] this distinction
[59:36] you might think oh levites are priests
[59:37] no not all levites entered the
[59:39] priesthood
[59:40] so you had a priest who would have been
[59:41] of the same tribe who went by psalm
[59:43] half dead let's get on the other side
[59:45] now levi when he was at the same place
[59:47] came and looked on him and passed by on
[59:50] the other side
[59:52] and what struck me today as i read this
[59:53] was missed opportunity
[59:57] that here was an opportunity for a
[59:58] priest to minister to someone
[1:00:02] to do good unto him to restore somebody
[1:00:05] who had gone from jerusalem to jericho
[1:00:08] and maybe they were in a mess of their
[1:00:09] own doing maybe they were getting what
[1:00:11] they deserved
[1:00:12] but now it was an opportunity for this
[1:00:14] this priest
[1:00:15] to minister to one and to show kindness
[1:00:17] to somebody to encourage them
[1:00:19] and give them a glimpse of faith give
[1:00:21] them a glimpse of love
[1:00:22] give them an opportunity to see christ
[1:00:24] lived out the god of truth
[1:00:26] lived out to see a hope to see a
[1:00:28] resource to see something that's worth
[1:00:30] living for
[1:00:31] here was an opportunity it was a missed
[1:00:33] opportunity
[1:00:34] this is a priest one who should have
[1:00:35] been inclined to serve he missed that
[1:00:38] opportunity
[1:00:38] now a levite one who ought to have been
[1:00:40] inclined to serve pass by on the other
[1:00:42] side what was it a miss opportunity
[1:00:44] to display the nature of the one true
[1:00:47] god that they were called to serve
[1:00:50] to fulfill leviticus 19
[1:00:53] and to love someone as their selves
[1:00:59] and brother bradley makes a statement
[1:01:02] when he writes in the church age book
[1:01:04] chapter 9 about laodicea
[1:01:05] i'm going to read it and then i want to
[1:01:07] phrase it a little bit differently
[1:01:09] not to change the context but to get you
[1:01:10] think about it even in a more pointed
[1:01:12] way
[1:01:13] and this speaks this quote may seem to
[1:01:15] be a little bit out of context i
[1:01:16] apologize that would be my fault for not
[1:01:19] uh uh i'm making the proper connection
[1:01:21] but perhaps the holy spirit can just
[1:01:22] blend this together
[1:01:24] brother brown says this elect cannot
[1:01:26] persecute elect
[1:01:27] elect cannot harm elect it is the
[1:01:30] reprobates that persecute and destroy
[1:01:32] the elect all those reprobates are
[1:01:35] religious
[1:01:36] they are smart they are of the cane line
[1:01:38] the serpent seed
[1:01:39] they build their babbles they build
[1:01:41] their cities they build their empires
[1:01:42] and all the wild calling on god
[1:01:45] they hate the true seed and they will do
[1:01:47] all they can even in the name of the
[1:01:49] lord to destroy
[1:01:50] god's elect ones
[1:01:54] now that's incredible now let me just
[1:01:56] read it this way
[1:01:58] elect cannot persecute elect cannot harm
[1:02:03] it is the reprobates that persecute and
[1:02:05] destroy
[1:02:06] they hate and they'll do all they can
[1:02:08] even in the name of the lord to destroy
[1:02:12] in other words it's not that elect don't
[1:02:14] persecute elect
[1:02:16] and it's not that elect cannot persecute
[1:02:18] elect or elect cannot harm elect elect
[1:02:20] do not harm anyone
[1:02:23] the elect don't persecute anyone it's
[1:02:25] not the elect the
[1:02:26] persecute the reprobates it's not the
[1:02:29] elect that persecute the unbeliever
[1:02:31] it is the reprobates that persecute and
[1:02:33] destroy it's they who are of that line
[1:02:35] of cain that hate
[1:02:37] they are the ones that do all they can
[1:02:38] to destroy the elect
[1:02:40] cannot destroy the elect cannot
[1:02:42] persecute
[1:02:43] the elect cannot harm anyone so it's not
[1:02:48] that we have this in our mind
[1:02:50] well elect don't persecute elect are
[1:02:51] they elect no persecute
[1:02:56] that that's not what brother branham's
[1:02:57] saying when he says elect cannot
[1:02:59] persecute elect
[1:03:00] he's trying to give us understanding
[1:03:02] that if you see someone persecuting
[1:03:04] they cannot be elect
[1:03:07] and if we as the elect are persecuting
[1:03:10] or destroying
[1:03:11] we are working off of our base instincts
[1:03:13] our carnal nature our own insecurities
[1:03:16] our own complexes and not the nature of
[1:03:18] christ that resides in us by the baptism
[1:03:20] of the holy ghost
[1:03:21] or we need that elect seed to be
[1:03:23] quickened which is the new birth
[1:03:25] let it come to life so that we can
[1:03:27] resist the urge to persecute
[1:03:29] resist the urge to destroy even in
[1:03:31] defense of our good name
[1:03:32] because elect cannot harm elect cannot
[1:03:35] persecute
[1:03:35] elect cannot destroy it is the
[1:03:37] reprobates that persecute and destroy
[1:03:39] those characteristics are not assigned
[1:03:41] to the elect
[1:03:44] regardless of the one who's receiving
[1:03:46] the persecution regardless of the one
[1:03:47] who's receiving the destroying
[1:03:50] that's why we do not need to defend the
[1:03:52] catholic church or those who use the
[1:03:53] name of christianity
[1:03:54] to go on their crusades and stand at the
[1:03:57] walls of cities
[1:03:58] and say renounce your religion renounce
[1:04:00] your son god
[1:04:02] accept the holy church and do so now or
[1:04:05] we will destroy you all
[1:04:07] and that's very a very horrible summary
[1:04:10] of what they were doing in the crusades
[1:04:12] but from spain and all these places they
[1:04:14] came over to north america and in the
[1:04:15] name of the bible
[1:04:16] in the name of christ destroyed genocide
[1:04:21] destroyed tribes destroyed other nations
[1:04:24] all because they would not resound
[1:04:25] renounce their idols and it was put to
[1:04:27] him you renounce what you believe you
[1:04:29] renounce your faith or we will be
[1:04:30] justified and destroy you from the face
[1:04:32] of the earth
[1:04:34] and don't think that you're better
[1:04:36] because you won't take the natural life
[1:04:39] if you do the same exact thing with your
[1:04:41] convictions today
[1:04:42] spiritually it was said the other day in
[1:04:45] our household it was preston who said
[1:04:46] something about somebody said that man's
[1:04:48] a murderer we're like oh my goodness
[1:04:49] gracious
[1:04:50] you go brother branham said you speak
[1:04:51] against somebody somebody's character
[1:04:53] you murder him i told him we're going to
[1:04:55] be we're going to watch it with this guy
[1:05:00] and he was identifying it already
[1:05:01] brother badam said
[1:05:03] he took it that simply he said that's a
[1:05:05] that's a murderer
[1:05:07] that's what brother branham was saying
[1:05:08] that we we operate under the same spirit
[1:05:12] it gets into our flesh our carna our
[1:05:13] complexes are our carnality our
[1:05:15] insecurities i'm not speaking to your
[1:05:16] election
[1:05:17] i'm identifying the humanity the human
[1:05:19] part we're all guilty of it
[1:05:22] there's not a minister in this message
[1:05:23] that could stand behind this pulpit and
[1:05:25] preach this guiltless or blameless as if
[1:05:27] they never said something negative about
[1:05:28] somebody else or have the wrong attitude
[1:05:30] to somebody who saw things differently
[1:05:32] we're all guilty because our humanity
[1:05:34] but i'm imploring you by the word of god
[1:05:35] to the christ that is in you
[1:05:37] to recognize these instincts and realize
[1:05:39] that as the elect i have no need to
[1:05:42] persecute
[1:05:42] as the elect i have no need to harm but
[1:05:45] rather i have what it takes to compel
[1:05:47] the seed in somebody else or to meet the
[1:05:50] needs where others are hurting
[1:05:53] jesus says it this way matthew chapter 5
[1:05:56] verses 38 to 48
[1:05:58] so many scriptures we'd like to read
[1:06:00] says ye have heard that hath been said
[1:06:02] an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[1:06:03] tooth
[1:06:05] but i say unto you that you resist not
[1:06:06] evil evil
[1:06:08] someone takes your eye you take their
[1:06:09] eye they take your tooth you take their
[1:06:10] tooth he says you're not resisting evil
[1:06:13] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[1:06:15] right cheek turn to him the other also
[1:06:18] and this isn't a countdown i got one
[1:06:21] cheek left buddy
[1:06:23] no he's just saying look don't render
[1:06:26] for evil
[1:06:26] evil and if any man will soothe thee at
[1:06:29] the law and take away thy coat
[1:06:30] let him have thy cloak also and
[1:06:32] whosoever shall compel thee to go
[1:06:33] mild go with him twain give to him that
[1:06:37] asketh thee and from him that would
[1:06:38] borrow thee turn not
[1:06:40] thou away give her that it hath been
[1:06:42] said so now
[1:06:43] jesus is uncovering something in their
[1:06:45] theology
[1:06:47] you've heard it said in your in your
[1:06:49] torah you've heard it said in your time
[1:06:51] and you've heard it spoken before
[1:06:53] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:06:55] thine enemy
[1:06:56] this is something they said love your
[1:07:00] neighbor
[1:07:00] hate your enemy what have we taught hate
[1:07:02] the sin love the sinner
[1:07:05] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:07:06] thy enemy but i say unto you love your
[1:07:08] enemies
[1:07:10] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:07:13] them that hate you
[1:07:14] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:07:16] you and
[1:07:17] persecute you you are to
[1:07:21] d did you read it with me love your
[1:07:23] enemies
[1:07:25] well so you have to know who your
[1:07:26] enemies are so you just do not love
[1:07:27] indiscriminately
[1:07:29] but your love is without dissimilation
[1:07:31] you have discernment to recognize
[1:07:32] that man hates me that man argues
[1:07:35] against the word that man hates the
[1:07:37] message that man
[1:07:38] reasons against one punctuation of the
[1:07:40] word and because of that he's my enemy
[1:07:42] but you know what the bible says love
[1:07:43] them
[1:07:45] love your enemies bless them that curse
[1:07:47] you if they curse you
[1:07:48] you do not withhold your blessing it
[1:07:50] says you bless them that curse you
[1:07:52] do good to them that hate you it doesn't
[1:07:54] say if they hate you withhold good he
[1:07:55] says pray for them which despitefully
[1:07:57] use you
[1:07:57] and persecute does not say withhold your
[1:07:59] prayer if they persecute you or use you
[1:08:01] it says pray for them so in cursing and
[1:08:04] hatred
[1:08:05] and despitefully using and persecution
[1:08:07] our response is not to withhold but is
[1:08:10] to love
[1:08:10] to bless to do good and to pray
[1:08:14] why that ye may be the children of your
[1:08:16] father which is in heaven
[1:08:17] this is the mark this is the distinction
[1:08:19] of a real queer christian
[1:08:20] they can pray for someone who uses them
[1:08:22] they can bless somebody
[1:08:24] who curses them they can love their
[1:08:25] enemies as
[1:08:27] even as they would love their neighbors
[1:08:29] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[1:08:31] evil and on the good
[1:08:32] and send it reign on the just and on the
[1:08:34] unjust brother branham expounds upon
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:36] so often for if you love them which love
[1:08:38] you what reward have you
[1:08:40] do not even the publicans the same
[1:08:44] if you only love your neighbor and hate
[1:08:46] your enemy
[1:08:48] if you only love those who are blood
[1:08:50] relation only love those who go to
[1:08:51] church with you only they'll love those
[1:08:52] whose
[1:08:53] doctrine aligns more closely with you
[1:08:55] then what reward is there
[1:08:57] do not even the publicans do the same
[1:08:59] and if you salute your brethren only
[1:09:01] what do ye more than others do not even
[1:09:03] the public and so
[1:09:06] is it not true that people often times
[1:09:08] will refuse to refuse to call you
[1:09:10] brother
[1:09:11] but rather mister or something else as a
[1:09:13] sign of disrespect
[1:09:14] to show to you i don't believe like you
[1:09:17] do
[1:09:19] and i will admit that myself at one time
[1:09:21] just being maybe very legalistic
[1:09:23] i say maybe it was be legalistic with
[1:09:25] the message i would have this idea how
[1:09:27] could you be a brother and deny the
[1:09:29] great truths that are in this message
[1:09:30] and i can say maybe technically i'm
[1:09:32] right
[1:09:34] but i'm not in harmony with the word
[1:09:37] though technically in compliance i'm
[1:09:38] completely outside the spirit
[1:09:40] and the intent of this word the real
[1:09:42] feeling of this word
[1:09:43] how can you salute your brethren and not
[1:09:45] salute others do not the republicans do
[1:09:47] the same
[1:09:49] oh hi brother so and so oh hi mister so
[1:09:52] and so
[1:09:54] shake this guy's hand until you say
[1:09:58] signaling right letting everybody else
[1:10:01] know i hope you're paying attention
[1:10:03] this guy's a believer this guy at best
[1:10:09] and after he says this you're resisting
[1:10:11] not evil to do an eye for an eye and a
[1:10:12] tooth for a tooth
[1:10:14] you're resisting not evil when you
[1:10:15] return and kind you're responding kind
[1:10:17] but love your neighbor love to love your
[1:10:21] enemies
[1:10:21] bless them that curse you do good unto
[1:10:23] them they hate you pray for them that
[1:10:24] use you and persecute you
[1:10:26] to prove to show that you're of your
[1:10:28] father which is in heaven so he says he
[1:10:30] concludes the whole thing
[1:10:31] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:10:33] which is in heaven is perfect
[1:10:36] and if i could add i believe jesus in
[1:10:38] doing so gives us a grace
[1:10:41] to help us to understand that this is
[1:10:44] not instinctive by natural birth
[1:10:46] this is not instinctive by carnal
[1:10:47] thought process but rather only by
[1:10:49] submission to him
[1:10:50] can you render really to those that are
[1:10:53] mentioned here in the scripture
[1:10:54] the things that the scripture requires
[1:10:56] be therefore perfect
[1:10:58] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:10:59] is perfect this scripture is often used
[1:11:01] in the context that we ought to
[1:11:02] live holy and dress holy and act holy
[1:11:05] and believe holy and and the mark of
[1:11:07] this age is perfection and we use it to
[1:11:08] speak of the believer
[1:11:09] that's coming into perfection that's
[1:11:11] born into the full manifestation of the
[1:11:13] word of god that which is perfect has
[1:11:14] come
[1:11:15] be there for perfect even as your father
[1:11:16] which is in heaven is perfect but
[1:11:18] jesus uses to amplify the truth to love
[1:11:21] your enemies
[1:11:22] to bless those that curse you to do good
[1:11:26] to them that hate you
[1:11:27] and pray for them that use you and
[1:11:29] persecute you
[1:11:31] and he says i know this is hard but you
[1:11:33] got to be perfect
[1:11:35] like your heavenly father is perfect
[1:11:38] in closing i'd just like to read two
[1:11:40] statements
[1:11:42] in works that i do bear witness of me
[1:11:46] brother brother says i don't care how
[1:11:47] long you've been a deacon deaconship
[1:11:50] ain't going to take you to heaven
[1:11:52] it's the blood of jesus christ that shed
[1:11:54] abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit
[1:11:56] that's going to take you up so you must
[1:11:59] be right with god
[1:12:01] with a good mellow sweet feeling towards
[1:12:04] everybody
[1:12:06] i want a good mellow sweet feeling
[1:12:08] towards everybody
[1:12:10] ready to do a favor and be a kind
[1:12:13] brother or sister
[1:12:14] to the person that you really know is
[1:12:17] your enemy
[1:12:20] i'm going to read it again he's talking
[1:12:23] about having the holy spirit in our
[1:12:24] hearts
[1:12:25] right with god with a good mellow sweet
[1:12:27] feeling towards everybody
[1:12:29] ready to do a favor and be a kind
[1:12:31] brother sister to the person
[1:12:32] that you really know is your enemy
[1:12:36] so you really know they're your enemy
[1:12:39] you haven't gone through this process of
[1:12:41] trying to reason and wrestle and say
[1:12:42] okay i think they're my enemy
[1:12:44] let me dissect this let me tear this
[1:12:46] apart you know what i'm not so sure they
[1:12:47] are my enemy
[1:12:48] so you know what i'll do i'll do them a
[1:12:50] favor and be kind to them because
[1:12:52] i'm not really sure they're my enemy
[1:12:55] but he's saying to the one you know that
[1:12:58] you know
[1:12:59] they're your enemy you still ought to be
[1:13:01] ready to do a favor and be kind
[1:13:02] to that person
[1:13:06] and then close in sister elizabeth if
[1:13:08] you come
[1:13:10] from that time brother branham says
[1:13:12] today we got the wrong conception of
[1:13:15] power
[1:13:17] power is overcoming returning good for
[1:13:20] evil
[1:13:23] now catch that power is overcoming
[1:13:27] the urge to return good for evil
[1:13:31] power is overcoming this instinct this
[1:13:34] human
[1:13:34] re reflex of returning good for evil he
[1:13:37] says
[1:13:38] that's real power power is overcoming
[1:13:40] returning good for evil now
[1:13:42] living above this attitude this instinct
[1:13:44] this desire
[1:13:45] this carnal process of returning good
[1:13:48] for evil he says
[1:13:48] that's real power real power is
[1:13:51] resisting the urge to render
[1:13:53] evil for good power is overcoming
[1:13:57] returning
[1:13:58] when others have done evil to you
[1:14:00] returning good for you
[1:14:01] power is overcoming power is returning
[1:14:03] good for evil
[1:14:04] that's real power power is not returning
[1:14:06] evil for evil
[1:14:09] that can love your enemy do good to
[1:14:11] those that do evil to you
[1:14:14] isn't that beautiful power is overcoming
[1:14:18] and not just merely overcoming sin
[1:14:20] but when evil is done to you returning
[1:14:22] good for evil
[1:14:25] that you can love your enemy do good to
[1:14:26] those that do evil to you
[1:14:28] that's real power
[1:14:31] that's god's power
[1:14:32] [Music]
[1:14:35] he says yes maniacs can break chains
[1:14:38] but it takes a real man to return good
[1:14:40] for evil from his heart
[1:14:42] not because of religious duty but from
[1:14:44] his heart
[1:14:45] takes a real man to not say
[1:14:49] because you hurt me i'll hurt you he
[1:14:52] says it's a real man that does it
[1:14:53] power is overcoming power is returning
[1:14:56] good
[1:14:57] when you've received evil so that's real
[1:15:00] power that you can love your enemy
[1:15:01] do good to those that do evil to you
[1:15:04] a real man
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:09] returns good for evil in other words
[1:15:12] when you've received evil you return
[1:15:13] good
[1:15:15] from the heart i'll say this just as a
[1:15:19] not as a caveat but maybe is it some
[1:15:21] qualification
[1:15:22] i'm not redefining love
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:26] the bible says god is love the bible
[1:15:30] says god is his word
[1:15:32] true love cannot be expressed apart from
[1:15:33] the word
[1:15:35] so i'm not redefining love i'm not
[1:15:36] trying to encourage compromise
[1:15:39] i'm speaking very directly to this
[1:15:40] principle of who is my neighbor
[1:15:43] in challenging some of our own instincts
[1:15:45] our own judgments
[1:15:46] our own biases our own prejudices to ask
[1:15:49] ourselves
[1:15:51] who is my neighbor and to consider
[1:15:54] all these different things that lay
[1:15:56] within this message that in this
[1:15:58] hour only those who are perfect will
[1:16:01] truly be able to express
[1:16:03] let's stand tonight
[1:16:10] appreciate your patience and your
[1:16:11] diligence just to stay focused as the
[1:16:13] word is going forth it's
[1:16:15] certainly a credit to you i can sense
[1:16:17] such a a real hunger in your
[1:16:20] hearts now as we bow our heads
[1:16:24] just offer prayer our gracious heavenly
[1:16:27] father
[1:16:28] lord the word is challenging
[1:16:32] we acknowledge that
[1:16:35] lord we recognize that
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:41] it's it's our instinct lord that when we
[1:16:43] have been offended
[1:16:45] even for self-preservation lord
[1:16:49] even to sustain a feeling of self-worth
[1:16:51] and to protect ourselves from
[1:16:54] emotional scars and
[1:16:57] to keep ourselves from succumbing to
[1:16:59] anxiety and
[1:17:01] oppression lord to keep ourselves from
[1:17:05] being overcome with grief and sadness
[1:17:07] many times we try to
[1:17:08] defend ourselves and kick against our
[1:17:11] oppressor and
[1:17:12] speak out against those that speak
[1:17:14] against us
[1:17:16] lord it's not that we are guilty many
[1:17:18] times because we're evil lord
[1:17:20] we're guilty many times because evil is
[1:17:22] done to us
[1:17:24] but i look into the word and the word
[1:17:25] does not make any distinction that when
[1:17:27] we have been done evil too
[1:17:29] we're justified for rendering evil but
[1:17:31] rather even
[1:17:32] so lord when we have been done evil too
[1:17:35] when we have taken evil we take it
[1:17:37] patiently
[1:17:37] when we have done been done harm when
[1:17:39] we've been aggrieved
[1:17:41] we must take it patiently
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:46] lord i pray that you would help us these
[1:17:49] things are not easy
[1:17:52] lord i pray that we could forgive those
[1:17:54] who've hurt us
[1:17:57] release our cares to you lord not grudge
[1:17:59] not avenge
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:03] regardless of how fresh the wounds may
[1:18:06] feel lord
[1:18:09] we're praying now father to help us to
[1:18:11] let go
[1:18:12] to not grudge to not avenge
[1:18:16] to no longer keep it but to let it go
[1:18:21] not because lord we want to justify
[1:18:23] their behavior not because we believe we
[1:18:25] deserved it not because
[1:18:26] we believed that they were not wrong but
[1:18:28] rather because we are sons we are
[1:18:29] daughters
[1:18:30] vengeance is yours saith the lord i'm
[1:18:32] going to walk in your grace i'm going to
[1:18:33] walk in your deliverance
[1:18:35] i'm going to walk in your healing lord
[1:18:38] you're going know pray lord that as we
[1:18:40] are commanded to be perfect even as you
[1:18:42] which are in heaven is perfect lord i
[1:18:45] ask and pray that you would be glorified
[1:18:47] in my life
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:49] that others would have a hard time
[1:18:51] recognizing whose friend and whose foe
[1:18:55] because i've learned to love even my
[1:18:57] enemies as myself
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:00] learn to love the stranger among me lord
[1:19:02] i've learned to love like you love
[1:19:05] lord not so that we would be wishy-washy
[1:19:07] not that we would compromise not because
[1:19:09] we're redefining love and making it
[1:19:10] sloppy agape or
[1:19:11] some kind of silly filio lord but rather
[1:19:14] because we
[1:19:14] know true father
[1:19:18] and because this truth must find that
[1:19:20] last seed
[1:19:23] and how can we rescue the hopeless lord
[1:19:26] how can we rescue the hurting
[1:19:28] how can we find and discover that last
[1:19:31] seed
[1:19:31] if we're too busy casting aspersion and
[1:19:35] disdaining and hating and separating
[1:19:37] from everyone who doesn't look like us
[1:19:39] and doesn't believe like us
[1:19:41] so i pray father you would help us have
[1:19:44] the kind of character it's going to take
[1:19:46] in this end time to find that last soul
[1:19:49] find the hurting sheep in this valley
[1:19:53] to be christ to those who've longed so
[1:19:55] long to see it
[1:19:57] and have only received a false image
[1:20:01] i pray you give us church of grace to
[1:20:03] manifest
[1:20:04] you lord to be neighborly not in what we
[1:20:07] can get from our neighbors but what can
[1:20:09] we give
[1:20:11] to serve and not to be served i commit
[1:20:14] to you these ones tonight lord
[1:20:17] we stand each one we're on our feet now
[1:20:19] and we confess with one heart
[1:20:21] we have been commissioned
[1:20:24] we have been appointed we receive it now
[1:20:28] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:20:30] i will walk in my healing i will walk in
[1:20:32] my liberty i'll walk with forgiveness in
[1:20:34] my heart
[1:20:35] i will lay aside grudges i will no
[1:20:37] longer revenge i will cast it unto you
[1:20:39] you are
[1:20:39] the one who is the judge you are the one
[1:20:42] who take vengeance
[1:20:43] lord we leave it to you we hold no right
[1:20:44] of justice we lay it at your feet
[1:20:46] we go forward to serve to minister
[1:20:49] and to love even our enemies father we
[1:20:52] ask it in the name of the lord jesus
[1:20:54] christ
[1:20:55] amen and it
