TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as follows but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you God bless you this morning you may be seated this morning God's inspired me to speak just a little um just a little about my testimony of what God's allowed me to go through this last year God is a strange God we have a strange God [Music] many times when you have to preach I was telling my brother Marcos in the back to preach gives me much stress not because it's difficult to stand up and speak because I believe my desire is always to bring forth something according to God's perfect will that first of all would help me and help the audience in which I'm speaking to [Music] idiots and God he'll inspire you in different ways [Music] about four or five months ago I started to talk to God I didn't feel close to God and with that being said I'd come Wednesdays and Sundays to church what's wrong with me assistant from God no no I felt as though I lost the communion with God and I started to cry out in My Heart Lord return back unto me I even lost the drive the desire to listen to the tapes the messages yes Brothers I I wasn't being precautious and I started to analyze my life and I started to cry out for months return unto me allow me for the desire to be close to you to come back to my heart to walk Close to You Lord and I look back to my house onto my family foreign I can't go and exceed my family to walk a hundred percent as a Christian when Mia is the head of that home is are not is not doing it and a cry started within my heart and I started then I saw problems over here problems over there I know God doesn't fail God he has his promises we're the ones that fail Senor Lord I need you my wife can't reach a spiritual level my son can't reach a spiritual level if me as the head is not at a spiritual level that I need to be at I am the head of this household and I've got to live a life we've been taught by this message it's better to live a life than to preach it reading the Bible even when Paul says because I've brought into your gospel not just words but of power and I don't have that power Lord maybe I have the gospel and I'm full of words but what good is it to me if the devil's taken away with my family and many times the devil taking away your family it's not that he takes it unto the world but you're not guiding them by the word of God if we are as uh went to go get some medical exams and God he's so strange I've learned like this we've got to be careful how we ask God for things Senor Lord one thing that I'm assured I'm tired of being a Christian that walks by the will your permissive will Cristiano I want to be a Christian there walks by the perfect will you know I don't want to continue by your permissive will I want to continue in your perfect will Lord but I need your help look Brothers and I've learned be careful you better be sure of what you're asking God when you ask him because God's perfect will it's completely different to your will are we sure many times we neces we're like those people that they need a driver Lord guide me by your perfect will and then we sit in the back of that car we give the steering wheel to God starts to drive but we want to keep telling them where to turn we want to tell him when to stop yes Brothers so we don't want God's perfect will the only thing that we want is to just deceive ourselves no somos we're not God's GPS if you're going to surrender your life to God's perfect will that's just like the airplane that little light turns on to put you to put your belt on because some turbulence is coming so you better be sure Medical I I went to go just get a routine medical exam and many things came about uh fatty liver high cholesterol I was suffering from uh uh pressure in my arteries me my heart rate was very low it would drop to about 39.40 in the evenings when I'm asleep we I went and well Brothers when I got out of there I said what did I even come for eign I left with the list of medications and I remember I got into my vehicle forgive me I know that I asked to be closer to thee yesterday but if this is your way help me and yes I got a little frightened because my liver the levels of my liver they were very high the doctor told me you've got to go to the liver specialist with the heart specialist I said okay that's when God started to deal with me that's when I noticed I just had a gospel of words why couldn't present myself before God how could I ask of him if I even turned around weeks that I'd pay my tithes and weeks that I wouldn't pay my tithes because we don't pay our tithes to God we give back to God what belongs to him even in that I was failing Lord as the leader of this family I'm just a disaster but I ask one thing of you I want to make a covenant with you help me to get through this Lord then I noticed one thing Maybe Poco the devil he deceived me a little then when I moved from Texas to Arizona I fell into a certain depression then myself I just didn't want to accept yes and that's what the devil loves for us not to accept our conditions because if you and I don't recognize our condition we're not going to ask for help so then as I was thinking Senor Lord help me I know that I've asked something of you for you to give back the desire to be close today brother when I was diagnosed with all those things at that moment I got a little scared but now I turn around that diagnosis was a blessing I got closer to God since then [Music] a sickness came to me I used to weigh 232 pounds now I weigh 186. a sickness Came Upon me yeah reflux raw reflux I'm sorry a reflux that caused me to not be able to eat there were nights that I felt as though I wasn't going to wake up from my own reflux I was gonna drown ing and I continue to feel without that power and the more that I felt that maybe my time was coming that got me getting closer and closer to God and I started to meditate upon one thing where I couldn't fall asleep Lord what is it that I'm doing wrong what am I doing wrong here help me to discover what I'm doing wrong and then the scripture came to my mind the second scripture that we just read seek ye first the kingdom of God and everything all things shall be added unto you Lord forgive me it's true I moved to Texas searching for the financial things all these years it's been my priority sadly as a Christian though I believe that I already had a real experience with you I'm a relationship that I had with you and from then on yes that doesn't leave my heart or my mind to seek first the kingdom of God I have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to help you control your riches and all the Temptations that come along with that I would meditate upon all those things and what if God would have blessed me in this condition that I was in would I be able to resist all those Temptations without his holy ghost close to me but I don't have anything Senor Lord the only thing that I've got is your Holy Spirit today and even in poverty he's given me he's my comforter he promised to give me enough for every day but I forgot about that he didn't promise to give me riches not that he cannot give it to me but he never made that promise to me and many times I went in search of that much many years I spent searching for the things he'd add on instead of the Kingdom e well Brothers I remember one evening because I remember I walked from the living room to my bedroom and my wife would be asleep and if and if I call 911 to come and help me or if I wake up my wife and we go to the emergency room because the hospital is nearby and I was in that condition for many hours until suddenly something came to me and what if I want to I want you to die you're in the best hospital even if you're in the best hospital you're going to die forgive me again Lord I failed you again I'm trusting in the hospital I'm trusted in an institution Assurance in my heart I'm not saying that it's bad to go to a hospital I believe everyone has to make their own decisions everyone has to be responsible for the consequences of your decisions there's many Christians they love to ask for advice so that afterwards if something wrong happens they can go blame the one they gave him the advice yes no no responsible every one of us are responsible now it's very good to have someone that can give us advice but at the end of the day you've got to be sure that you're the one that has to make the decision because you're going to suffer the consequences of that decision mm-hmm Osa foreign I remember that night it just came and passed I remember what I said I remember what brother Brandon said we can't do anything but the devil can't do anything more than what God allows him to sign if it's not my time to die okay so I don't go to a hospital I'm not gonna die tonight and from there God started to lift me up and if it's my time to die whether I'd be surrounded by all the specialists it's the time that God's prepared for me the only thing I told God I don't know Lord if it's my time or not but don't allow me to go without being able to have another experience with you and then there are began Brothers every time they've given me pills for my reflux I made the decision to no longer take them every time that acid reflux would come on I'd run to the pills and I grabbed that bottle and I remember what God Said through the prophet God can't do anything more the god the devil can't do anything more than what God allows him and I put that bottle right back down and I'd run to the bedroom to pray brothers and pray and pray until that pain would go one or two days later again and once I heard I remember I was going with my child and we were going into the lake I was listening to a song about David and Goliath Como how um when Goliath challenges God's people and tells them choose amongst all of you the best soldier that you've got and send him but but yes the one that overcomes or the one that loses is going to be a servant of the winner I said Lord I felt such security I just confronted my Goliath is I don't want to be a slave no more to any illness the devil's just a big blood fur mucho and for many years I've been serving him foreign in front of every challenge that the devil would shoot at me and that's how it is with the Devil if he overcomes you're going to be a slave to what he's challenging you with Diablo the devil also doesn't change his way of how he operates many times that's the problem with us Christians that sometimes we forget that the Bible also shows us the devil's way of acting and we don't pay attention to that many times the the challenges come in the Bible there's everything in the message so then the god began and he got me closer and closer he healed me of the reflux ion arterial he healed me from the the artery pressure the pressure in my arteries it's been about three to four months that I don't take medication for my arteries no he healed me from my liver because once I lost that weight I went to the liver specialist and told me did you lose weight he said there's no problem normally it takes about two to three months for for the exams to come out come back later to have those exams but everything's gonna be okay then when I went to the specialist the heart specialist are you video mediotra was God gave me and I'll say it like this another Faith vaccine um when I sat down with the doctor they sent me there because of my heart rate because it was so low and she told me Nicole okay well I just read the hit I just read your family history it says right here your older sister when she was young she had open heart surgery and that's why you have the the you run the risk of having a heart attack yesterday you've got to take this this this this and this medication I said but I didn't come for that I just came because my heart rate is very low oh I'm not really worried about that about that well why am I worried about it and when she was telling me all of that something inside of me Brothers said don't accept that don't take that medication I didn't tell the doctor anything but within my heart I didn't accept it I haven't taken none of the medication that she gave me I've take I've been taking more Medicaid medication or more vitamins vitamin f God's helping me even just reading the message brother Branham says that it won't once he is he was sick and now I'm going back to God's perfect will in over us he speaks it here in faith without works is dead he said that for eight years he struggled with the illness where he couldn't eat for eight years he said he turned around and he'd see those that were around him now they ate that he desired but he couldn't eat after those eight years God healed him and what does that do to me I start to meditate upon this that sometimes I want God's answer quickly I want God to answer me from one day to the next if a servant of God had to struggle for eight years Abraham had to wait for 25 years so that who am I forgot to answer me immediately God has to test our faith foreign I've learned this and this has also helped me is I've been meditating a lot upon my own life when I started there's three three reasons why one has to examine their own life at least the ones that I've learned through the Bible what you're going through the first what happened to job God was testing him to prove to the devil that he was the son of God the second is that man that was blind he said well who sin him or his parents well no one did so the God's glory could be manifested foreign to go through certain things so God's glory can be manifest to others then why are we complaining what a good child of God we are [Music] though sometimes what happened to job happens to us uh we we get into this form s uh attorney oh we we accuse God and we put God in in the the accusations Lord get up there and I'm going to start to ask why is this that's happening to me happening to me who gave us that right to put God in that sea of accusation you know and one wants to start to ask don't you want God's perfect will then why are you asking me but okay but okay remember that after me it's going to be your turn isn't that what happened to job when God started to ask him well where were you who were we I said 45 years ago I was no one I didn't even exist on this Earth how can I start to claim unto God I'm nobody I'm just a servant of his but the other thing is what happened in Jericho Brothers because of sin because of breaking God's laws there was evil and that's what happened to me when I started to examine my life remember one thing we serve a jealous God we can't play games with god with God we can't be Christians today and not tomorrow I've heard many brothers say and sometimes I've been able to work with Brothers sometimes the owners they make a mistake being that they're Christians they say the church is one thing and business is another communication what can a Christian say that Christian whether in church or at your business you can't separate the things of God from where you're at foreign and sometimes we make those mistakes we want to put God into certain places and say wait here when I get to this place I'll be a Christian but over here I have to be a businessman Above All Things We Should Be sons of God wherever we stand we do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the Lord Jesus we can't separate adios God at any moment and the devil wants to deceive us like that sometimes that's when we start to separate ourselves God he's healed me for many things and I start to meditate upon the deity what is deity God in us Brothers but to get Pablo I I really like Paul o I love Paul I love brother Branham but I was reading and I've been studying the story of Abraham God made a covenant with Abraham and he was the god of Abraham but the moment came that he had to be the god of Isaac there had to be a moment that he had to be the god of Jacob and sometimes we stay to know that God he loves the deity Garden human flesh but it's so beautiful Brothers to see the Bible and believe that God was in Paul and God came and revealed himself in human flesh through the Lord Jesus Christ it's so beautiful we can believe it you know what's the most difficult part about deity how many of us can stand up and say I discovered one thing when the devil would challenge me I didn't have the power Brothers I couldn't say like Paul um I'd stay just in the gospel of words but now I can say I've got a gospel of power also but you know what I had to accept first the God was right here it's beautiful to understand God worked through brother Branham brother Branham says I was just reading it I've seen many people that they pray for the sick even my daughter of three years old she's prayed for the sick and I was just thinking Lord forgive me I've been at fault I've been guilty and many times I say that I believe in the deity many Christians we lie to ourselves we believe in the deity it's not true if you believed in deity you could pray at any moment for a sick person because you know that God is in you you could you'll say I know God's given everyone different gifts we should be paramedicos paramedics spiritually speaking a paramedic no it doesn't operate or do surgery he probably doesn't even know a lot about prescribing medication when someone is wounded like that's Samaritan he said that he took care of him he got him stable and then took him to the place to get help but many times we don't even want to take that job we are should be paramedics to be able to stabilize any person that needs us to help them don't we have a message that's been revealed unto us foreign we'll go to the Book of Genesis is let's go to Genesis Chapter 18 from 1 to 3. and in this scripture this is where many times we get conformed as Christians Genesis chapter 18 verse 1 to 3. and it reads questions Sierra and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them at the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant and there was deity right there was God in human flesh foreign speaking with the deity you know that as I meditate upon that is God that's okay experience like that shouldn't be just enough I can't be confirmed with just seeing you before by before someone in my human flesh that's not the deity that I wanted me we see God working in someone else and we believe in deity there was deity Abraham having God face to face and many times we have that encounter with God and we're conformed to them we forget that we're in another age where God said that he would send the comforter the deity it's God in us they say this brother Branham says that when Abraham as Abraham truly he found God's real deity he says when God went to send him to sacrifice Isaac that was God in Abraham practicing what he was going to do with his son that was the true deity Brothers says God and Abraham practicing what later he was going to do with Jesus that's where I want to reach conformed with just seeing God in another human flesh which that's okay but I need him right here or else we're not a part of his Summit the Bible says the second coming of God would be like in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah I believe that we're already in those days and brothers they say the Bible says many wanted to live in our day and if we're living those days when I discovered this Brothers we're the Royal Seed of Abraham where the true Seed of Abraham and if we're Abraham's seed we have to act like him we're going to Genesis 18. 1817. and it reads and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do there's a great treasure there I don't know if you see it I'm going to read the question once again Genesis 18 17. and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do wasn't that the days of Sodom as God hid something from us today didn't he send us a powerful message God doesn't hear anything from us the same thing he did that day he's done it for us let's say hit something for me of what he's going to do no no no God has given us all Revelations but many but sometimes there's the problem this message I it creates many theologians many people they base themselves on theology well just see Brothers many maybe we don't have faith but we can preach upon any mystery of the Bible still haven't found the kingdom of God yet you know what the problem is that when we go sometimes and study the Mysteries and then to be able to find the kingdom of God becomes more of a mystery because you've got to understand that you're nothing and oh how it's so difficult to be able to accept that you're nothing seek ye first I know the kingdom of God and all things shall be added unto you but sometimes I've been searching or I was searching all those things added but not the kingdom of God God hasn't hit anything from us what do you want what do you need there's deity that's why every time that I come to church even in that regard God has changed the way that I come to church I come to worship God every time the song leader starts to sing I surrender to him doesn't the Bible not say that God dwells in worship so then I don't know who's next to me before well look just look at this even in that God's changed me before I used to care what are the people going to say about me if I stand up if I start to worship God maybe lifting up my hands is going to bother the guy behind me so Alto God may be tall maybe I won't allow the person behind me to see but you know Brothers now I just don't care the only thing that I know is that I worship my creator and that he dwelleth in the worship and if he dwells in the worship I want him to see me the best way possible and sometimes I put myself when I get to my house I dwell in my home and when I see my wife's face I know what what what uh mood she's in when I see my son just by his face I know if he's happy or not that's how it is in the worship I could imagine God in the worship and as he enters into worship Brothers looking at every single one of our faces foreign just with the face alone the one that he knows the one that knows the thoughts and what's inside of our hearts Brothers deity in every Christian in every Christian should be there should be the seven compound names of God in there Jehovah Jireh the Lord provided Jehovah Rapha is the Lord my healer I'm a witness of that what do you need there are those seven names but one thing yes yes that one is a Christian you have to accept and believe that God dwells in you God's in you second have you ever thought why God he told Brother Branham if you can make the people believe you there's a great mystery right there you and I said you think it's just for brother Branham who stay you're you and I the name we've got to do we've got to make the people believe us as as Christians brothers that's part of deity for the people to believe in us maybe they believe in God but they don't believe in you and that's blocking God can't act without a human vessel so even in that Brothers I've meditated upon that plenty help me Lord for the people to believe in me through his gospel they will be judged he didn't say by the Gospel of Jesus Christ said through his gospel deity even ly Lord help me I'm me Priority my priority it's two scriptures yes yes to be able to say if they don't believe me my words then look at my works and that will make them believe give me the gift of Miracles God gave me the order hola is the commission to go and preach the gospel and pray for the sick and why do we deny that and I discovered why I would deny myself because I didn't even believe in my own self yes that's the first thing how can God heal someone if you can't even believe in your own prayer second to make the people believe in you foreign one day we had a little discussion with a brother he would say is the people have an experience with God you have to go run out to the streets and preach the gospel no take it easy that's not according to the gospel because many times no that's not according to the Bible even if we go with Jesus when Jesus when he was baptized he received the Holy Spirit he didn't go out and preach he went 40 days and 40 nights to fast Pablo Paul he didn't go out and preach right away he went to go first seek the kingdom of God more so to make sure what he had found was the kingdom of God then I believe it's in second Peter where it says that the wives even with their composure they can make people be converted it doesn't say that they'll speak if you read there it doesn't say a single word about the wife having to speak this is just by her composure there are ways of preaching but we have to first believe in ourselves to be God servants to stop being Servants of that Goliath that's been oppressing us we're Servants of God Brothers what do we need Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jehovah that is Jesus of the New Testament I didn't too much use my notes God he's strange Brothers that's what I've learned you know you could say well you've been raised your whole life in the gospel yes but the Bible also says we're going from light to light and from glory to glory we're learning there's times where we've read scriptures for years like this about Abraham this is about Abraham I read it for many many times but I never seen that God had told him or God asked himself should I hit hide these things from Abraham Brothers said you've got to see yourself in every part of the scriptures I put myself into that right away I said Abraham I saw Abraham and I put myself there has God hit something for me if I'm wrong it's not because of God it's my fault look another one of the things that I found you how did promise the people of Israel and I want to close with this God promised the people of Israel that they'd be slaves for 400 years and then after that he'd get them out of Egypt that was a promise God already gave the people of Israel for how many years were they slaves 425. but even so apart from the fact that God already gave the promise to Abraham that he would rescue him that promise was already there it says until the people of God started to cry out that promise was already given it was already there God didn't make it effective until the people of God they started to cry out for the promise because I'm reminded of the promise for the Cry of my people Lord how many promises are in the Bible did I still haven't claims the promises are right there Brothers if you don't have this it's because you haven't claimed them yet those promises were already there the only thing claim them God already gave them to us yes Dan they're already there you got to believe it says because I remember God forget about the promise but the people of God yes because they were they weren't happy and it took them to believe that it was impossible for God to fulfill his promise how could God rescue them Army of the world the circumstances took them to not leave that they were God's people that's what happens to us the promise of the Holy Spirit it's already there many people don't have it because they don't claim it remember one thing Jesus once was walking he saw a tree yes it wasn't the season to give fruit but because of not having fruits God cursed it we're compared to trees and we've got to give fruits we've got to give fruits because we know that God doesn't like trees without fruits let us all stand Brothers I'm going to close with this small story of brother Branham when he went on his honeymoon when he got married the second time he said that he went into the mountain yeah what he took his wife they said that he got there you can find it and the message of seven compound names of God so he left behind as his wife and his his child his son [Music] he took them on that honeymoon he said one day once they were there he started walking trying to uh chase that deer that he was going to hunt I believe you've heard the story already he kept walking and walking and hunting him once he now realized he was who knows how many miles away from where his wife was and his son and he said that a storm started to come but he trusted his own abilities that he can come back whenever he wanted because he felt himself to be an expert where he was at could have run into any danger he said that this storm came and he said that that storm came down he couldn't see he couldn't see good but even so he kept trusted in his own abilities and he said that he started to walk and walk he said he starts to walk in circles but he kept trusting in his abilities and he kept saying you can't be lost you can't be going through this you're an expert in this is he said that he tried to comfort his own self and something inside of him started to tell him you're lost and he kept trusting in his abilities I'm not lost I'm an expert I know how to get out of this is how many times have we been in that situation We Trust so much in our abilities are possibly all of our resources we think that our own selves we can get out of those problems [Music] we can make things easier we keep trusting says he had to accept that he'd lost all of his abilities right there until he accepted that he lost all of his abilities understood that I knew the message that I preached I knew how to lead my wife I didn't know or I couldn't because I didn't have the Holy Ghost [Music] maybe I knew but I was going to just do it religiously I wanted to put burdens that I wasn't even willing to take [Music] I kept trusting in my abilities until I had to accept that I was lost that I was going crazy [Music] that takes you to a place of crying out unto God [Music] that's what happened to brother Branham in that moment so that he had to accept [Music] that he was nothing except cry unto God put everything aside [Music] the expert that he thought he was [Music] and surrender to God Brothers he had to make a decision of life or death because his wife and his son were running the risk of death and the more pressure he had he started to lose that notion more and more that's what sometimes happens to us the Daily pressure takes us to lose that are common sense faith but we keep thinking that we we can get out of that [Music] like I tell people we want to change the rest of the people when who's been able to change their own selves no one he said it says until brother Branham accepted he didn't have any abilities he Cried unto God responded [Music] then he remembered it made him remember about that wire [Music] he got hold of that wire and he started to walk yes was gonna take him to his wife and son were I asked myself what is a cable it's a conductor of energy that's sometimes what we need [Music] we need to get a hold of that conductor to take us to the place we need to go maybe not to say somebody's life but to save our own life [Music] that confusion that we're in one thing yes you first have to trust in yourself and Trust in the person that's going to pray for you or else it'll be difficult or else what is beautiful is it God give you faith I love that like that woman that blood issue [Music] brother Branham says sometimes that's another problem with us we want to feel um [Music] a great experience with God [Music] no brothers simply and just accept him though you don't feel anything but one thing I do know brother Brandon said if you believe it then act as though you believe healed yes and that's true I started to declare my healing weeks before God gave me the healing but we say sometimes we're healed how are you a little sick how are you I am I'm getting just a little better no that's not acting like you believe how are you yeah I'm good God has blessed me I like a phrase that the apostolics have in Mexico when one asked the other how are you blessed and in Victory amen amen [Music] that's what every Christian should answer possibly [Music] you struggle is that blessing is from you to someone else let us pray Lord Jesus Christ I thank you this morning father first of all forgive our sins and our iniquities if we find grace before you Lord Jesus Christ allow us Lord to be able to enter into that atmosphere Lord virtue to come out of your Holy Spirit you said [Music] that you would dwell in human bodies help us Lord to cleanse these temples foreign and even Lord if someone this morning needs the Holy Spirit may you be with that person Lord Give Them Enough Faith Lords and give them the new birth at this moment [Music] and the rest shall be added unto them healing temperance [Music] even Lord if we're in the stage help us to grow to the next allow us to worship and glorify you Lord and even in the worship Lord someone needs more throughout the worship Lord you give a promise Lord do you dwell in the midst of the worship may they Lord enter into the atmosphere and you will grant according to their heart thank you this morning in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you
