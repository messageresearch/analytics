[0:03] for we know that the law is spiritual
[0:06] but i am carnal
[0:07] sowed under sin
[0:09] for that which i do i allow not
[0:13] for what i would that do i not but what
[0:16] i hate
[0:17] that do i now i just want to say just
[0:20] before we begin to read this it's
[0:22] incredible when you read that you can
[0:24] back up to the title slide there brother
[0:26] john and just hold it on that
[0:28] when you read this romans 7 and i
[0:30] appreciate the liberty brother aaron's
[0:31] given me because it would take a long
[0:33] foundation for me to lay but i i just
[0:36] want to jump right in just from what the
[0:37] lord has
[0:39] but when you read this romans 7 it's
[0:41] amazing i'm not going to get into the
[0:42] doctrinal application
[0:44] of who paul was speaking about and where
[0:46] it applies we know that paul was
[0:48] speaking about himself when he begins to
[0:51] say that i'm carnal sold under sin he's
[0:53] speaking personally this is to him
[0:56] but it's amazing when you read this
[0:58] because it's it's almost as if you've
[1:00] stumbled upon a diary of the apostle
[1:03] paul and he wasn't expecting anybody to
[1:05] read it but he was just almost
[1:07] expressing his thoughts you'll pick up
[1:09] on the way that he writes this is he's
[1:11] almost like he's it's the dawning on him
[1:14] as he writes it so if i can accomplish
[1:17] and do anything here tonight i've just
[1:19] got something very simple but maybe i
[1:21] could help you help us to understand
[1:24] us the lord understands every part about
[1:27] us he knows us from our inside all the
[1:30] way to the outside he knows all the
[1:32] pretense he knows all the facade he
[1:34] knows who we really are
[1:37] but this is what's this is what what
[1:39] romans 7 reveals is it helps us to
[1:42] understand if you've ever
[1:44] wondered or thought to yourself how i i
[1:47] know that i love the lord i know i've
[1:49] been born of a spirit i know that god's
[1:51] did something in my life
[1:53] i could say like the woman i'm not who i
[1:55] want to be but i know this i'm not who i
[1:57] used to be
[1:58] and i know the lord has done something i
[2:00] love his word but yet i still even even
[2:03] within that there's still a constant
[2:05] struggle or a constant battle i'm in a
[2:08] war always with myself to do that what i
[2:11] really want to do and if you've ever
[2:13] felt that way well you're right at home
[2:16] with the apostle paul here
[2:18] so we're going to understand ourselves
[2:19] just a little bit better here tonight
[2:21] let's just begin reading again at verse
[2:23] 14 for we know that the law is spiritual
[2:25] but i'm carnal soul under sin for that
[2:27] which i do i allow not for what i would
[2:29] that do i not but what i hate that do i
[2:33] if then i do that which i would not i
[2:35] consent unto the law that it is good
[2:38] now then it is no more i that do it but
[2:40] sin that dwelleth in me for i know now
[2:42] notice when paul uses the word me
[2:47] because you have to understand that can
[2:49] have many contexts what part of paul and
[2:53] he specifies is he speaking of let's
[2:56] pick it up here for i know that in me
[2:59] parentheses that is
[3:01] in my flesh
[3:03] dwelleth no good thing
[3:07] for to will is present with me but how
[3:11] to perform
[3:12] that which is good
[3:14] i find not
[3:17] for the good that i would
[3:19] i do not
[3:21] but the evil which i would not that i do
[3:24] now if i do that i would not it is no
[3:27] more i that do it but sin that dwelleth
[3:29] in me i find then a law
[3:32] that when i would do good
[3:35] evil is present with me
[3:39] nella's going to talk about another part
[3:41] of himself
[3:42] for i
[3:44] delight in the law of god after the
[3:46] inward man
[3:49] so what is paul saying there's more to
[3:52] you
[3:52] than what you see in the mirror
[3:56] there's more to you than what you deal
[3:58] with on a daily basis there's another
[4:00] part in fact there's two of you you say
[4:02] brother matt are you schizophrenic
[4:04] multiple personalities went away you
[4:06] really are brother branham said a man is
[4:09] triune being he's made up of body soul
[4:12] spirit inside of that body is five
[4:14] senses inside of that spirit is five
[4:17] senses your memory your conscience your
[4:19] reasoning imagination your affection
[4:23] and all of those make up who you are now
[4:26] but down on the inside the prophet said
[4:29] but there's a soul down inside of there
[4:31] and that's the real you
[4:34] don't ever let the devil point to
[4:36] something in your flesh and say that's
[4:37] who you are really that's not who i am
[4:40] who i really am is that inside man down
[4:43] on the bottom of my heart
[4:45] that's what the prophet said and we're
[4:46] going to read that here in a moment now
[4:48] notice he says for i delight in the law
[4:50] of god
[4:51] after the inward man but i see another
[4:55] law in my members
[4:57] warring against the law of my mind and
[5:00] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[5:02] sin which is in my members o wretched
[5:05] man that i am
[5:06] who shall deliver me from the body of
[5:08] this death and we can say with paul i
[5:11] thank god
[5:12] through jesus christ our lord
[5:15] so then when so then with the mind i
[5:17] myself serve the law of god but with the
[5:19] flesh the law of sin lord we're so
[5:22] grateful to be here tonight
[5:24] i just look to you now
[5:26] jesus as humbly as i can
[5:29] lord fully aware of my own failures
[5:32] humanly of lord my own weaknesses
[5:36] lord i stand here in the right with this
[5:38] group of people that's gathered here
[5:40] tonight in great need of you lord great
[5:42] need of your word of your spirit lord to
[5:45] come and speak to these people lord and
[5:47] would you give them something that would
[5:49] have an eternal value something lord
[5:51] that would benefit them in their journey
[5:53] i pray that you'd bless brother aaron
[5:55] sister elizabeth their family this
[5:57] church god may you answer their prayers
[5:59] may you set the captives free heal the
[6:01] sick lord i pray that every hindrance
[6:03] would be removed that satan tries to
[6:05] block lord i pray that you would have
[6:07] your way in everything that's done
[6:09] tonight and then in the name of the lord
[6:12] jesus christ amen amen you can be seated
[6:19] so brother branham answers this in
[6:20] questions and answers i'm so glad we had
[6:22] a vindicated prophet and we don't have
[6:25] to ask questions many of them are
[6:27] answered already for us
[6:29] and so the prophet of god begins here
[6:31] and he asks this man asked this question
[6:33] and if you go to the next slide you'll
[6:35] see that it's romans 7 14 through 18 and
[6:38] bold because that's how the question was
[6:40] labeled and he comes and he quotes all
[6:43] of this all the way down we know that
[6:44] law is spiritual what we just now read
[6:47] and then he comes to his question and he
[6:49] just asks brother branham this question
[6:51] after he quotes romans 7 and he says
[6:54] this
[6:54] i cannot understand
[6:56] so brother branham gives him an answer
[6:58] and he answers this romans 7. let me
[7:00] kind of just polish it up so you can see
[7:03] in me
[7:04] is
[7:05] two
[7:06] persons
[7:09] one
[7:09] wants me to do wrong the other wants me
[7:13] to do and brother branham is gonna say
[7:14] right
[7:15] every time i start to do right then the
[7:18] wrong
[7:19] hinders me
[7:21] how many of you people on the interviews
[7:22] this afternoon has run that same thing
[7:25] this morning isn't incredible brother
[7:26] branham is going to relate the
[7:28] interviews that he has people are
[7:30] privately coming to the prophet asking
[7:33] not great deep mysterious ethereal
[7:35] things about the seals this is their
[7:37] question
[7:38] is romans 7
[7:40] that i have a desire i know i've been
[7:42] born again brother branham i know
[7:44] something has changed me but yet i still
[7:46] have a struggle with things that i don't
[7:49] want to have a struggle with i'm going
[7:51] to be honest and say i still make
[7:53] mistakes i still have hindrances i still
[7:55] fall i still have trouble come on
[7:58] christians
[7:59] i still have issues and brother adam
[8:00] says even in the interviews you're
[8:02] asking to run into the same thing
[8:05] we are carnal
[8:06] and that part must perish but then
[8:09] inside we are a spirit man soul inside
[8:14] and that's faith in god's word
[8:16] then we bring our outside body
[8:20] under subjection to the word by faith by
[8:23] accepting what god said
[8:27] right so he says there's two people
[8:29] inside of you how can i be born of the
[8:32] spirit of god i know i've come into the
[8:34] a new life i know i'm a new creature i
[8:37] can say
[8:38] all things are passed away all things
[8:40] are becoming new but yet brother man i
[8:42] can still backslide uh i can still get
[8:45] so low in my spirit that i can even
[8:47] question if i've ever even known god in
[8:50] the first place
[8:51] how many people would be honest enough
[8:53] to say i've been right there
[8:56] and the prophet of god said see there's
[8:57] two there's two parts of you there's two
[8:59] persons so the holy ghost and i want to
[9:02] emphasize this the holy spirit by the
[9:05] new birth brings a total change
[9:09] in your life
[9:11] so much that the apostle paul would say
[9:13] all things are passed away behold all
[9:16] things are become new so the holy ghost
[9:19] changes everything in your life but let
[9:21] me say it this way it doesn't change
[9:26] everything
[9:29] they say brother matt now how can we say
[9:31] that are you sure that you're you're
[9:32] correct on the well
[9:34] i'm still living in a body and i had a
[9:36] headache this morning actually rolled
[9:37] out of bed had a lower back some lower
[9:39] back pain
[9:42] so the holy ghost changes but it doesn't
[9:45] change everything
[9:46] i'm preaching to you tonight on being
[9:48] changed so the holy spirit comes in your
[9:50] life but yet there's a part of you that
[9:53] the holy ghost because you only have the
[9:55] earnest you don't have the full
[9:57] inheritance of adoption yet but you have
[9:59] a down payment you've received heaven on
[10:02] earth and that's why you're here tonight
[10:04] that's why you believe the word of god
[10:06] that's why you're attracted to the
[10:07] attraction it's because god's put
[10:09] something on the inside he's quick in
[10:11] life but yet you still live in a human
[10:14] body that's rotting
[10:16] that's dying that still has trouble that
[10:19] still has issues
[10:21] brother branham says that that way
[10:22] there's two creatures inside of you two
[10:25] persons let's just keep reading here
[10:27] just for a moment and he says we we
[10:30] bring it under subjection next slide it
[10:31] says how can i take a cockle burr and
[10:34] make a grain of wheat out of it it's
[10:36] impossible for me to do it the only way
[10:39] it can be is because inside that cockle
[10:41] burr has been transmitted from a
[10:43] cocklebur wheat a cocklebur
[10:46] to a germ
[10:48] called wheat life
[10:50] then you bury that cocklebur and it'll
[10:53] produce a grain of wheat that's right
[10:56] because there has been a life of wheat
[10:58] put in the cucumber and the life of the
[11:01] cocklebur has been taken out notice but
[11:04] the nature of the cocklebur is still
[11:08] sticky
[11:10] and it will be
[11:12] until this new life
[11:14] has fully been developed out of the
[11:18] ground and raised up again
[11:21] now i just want to stop here for a
[11:22] moment because you notice that brother
[11:24] brandon begins to speak about this and
[11:26] he even makes the statement and he talks
[11:28] about how that we're made up the bible
[11:30] takes a long time to to we we could
[11:32] spend a long time speaking about this
[11:34] and we're just we're not going to we're
[11:36] going to skip some of this just to save
[11:37] time but if you really think about this
[11:40] you're if you thought you were a weirdo
[11:42] you are i can just go ahead and clear
[11:44] that up for you tonight if you thought
[11:46] you're an oddball or a strange person
[11:49] it's true
[11:50] i wish i had different news but it's
[11:52] very true you're the bible says you're
[11:54] made up and brother branham even begins
[11:56] to speak about this in the greatest
[11:57] battle of her fault we're going to read
[11:58] some quotes from that but if you look at
[12:00] it there's two distinct life forces
[12:04] there's two distinct spirits there's two
[12:07] distinct powers that are always trying
[12:10] to influence you remember the prophet of
[12:12] god says even when he was a little boy
[12:14] he says i came to the baptism of the
[12:16] holy ghost and i was born of the spirit
[12:18] he said but i should have came to that
[12:20] long before i did
[12:22] but there was a spirit that hung over my
[12:24] life that hindered me or prevented me
[12:28] brother branham would answer the
[12:29] question do you believe in that there
[12:30] could be a a guardian angel is that just
[12:33] a myth and the prophet answers and says
[12:34] no he says absolutely that when it when
[12:37] a baby's born there's an angel there
[12:40] waiting to receive that life of that
[12:42] child and the prophet says there's an
[12:44] angel that's with you that protects you
[12:46] that walks with you there's an there's
[12:49] an influence from heaven that is always
[12:52] there trying to influence you trying to
[12:55] impact you it was what led you to an
[12:57] altar or in a hotel room or driving in
[13:00] your car when the lord started dealing
[13:02] with your heart there was an angel that
[13:04] was always trying to get a hold of you
[13:06] and woo you and bring you to god
[13:09] that angel followed you to the altar
[13:11] that was that spirit of god trying to
[13:13] reach the seed down inside the god place
[13:16] there before the foundation of the world
[13:18] but the prophet said also as much as
[13:20] there was an angel there was also a
[13:23] demon spirit that hung over him now
[13:26] imagine that
[13:27] i can't emphasize this enough those two
[13:29] spirits are there
[13:32] all the time
[13:34] even after you're born of the spirit of
[13:35] god there is an angel that is always
[13:38] trying to influence you the spirit of
[13:40] god that's always there trying to speak
[13:42] to you
[13:43] and there's always a spirit there trying
[13:45] to destroy you
[13:48] there's always a spirit there trying to
[13:50] discourage you
[13:51] you can be born of the spirit of god
[13:53] filled with the baptism of the holy
[13:54] ghost and they're still in a spirit that
[13:56] is trying to discourage the family of
[13:59] god he tries to talk to you he whispers
[14:02] to you he's the one telling you all the
[14:03] lies that you're not good enough you'll
[14:05] never make it you'll never overcome look
[14:08] at you look at yourself he's always
[14:10] there trying to hinder the word of god
[14:13] from coming to birth or to full fruition
[14:16] in your life
[14:17] can you say amen and so brother madam
[14:19] talks about a person he says even a
[14:21] person who's not born again and he says
[14:23] they're under the dominion of sin
[14:26] they're always under the dominion
[14:28] remember the prophet says he even draws
[14:30] it on the future home and he draws and
[14:32] he says here's one heart there's a snake
[14:34] a serpent inside that heart and he says
[14:36] then here's a heart over here and
[14:37] there's a dove down inside that heart
[14:39] and he said notice what's changed in the
[14:42] control room of the heart when that
[14:44] man's born of the spirit of god the
[14:47] snake nature has been removed from the
[14:50] control room and the nature of the dove
[14:54] or the holy ghost is now there pulling
[14:57] the levers
[14:58] and pushing the buttons
[15:01] hallelujah i'm thankful for that
[15:03] so he says there's always notice here
[15:05] he's brother branham says there's
[15:06] there's talks about a person he says but
[15:08] a man who's never been born again he
[15:11] says a christian remember he says a
[15:12] christian is the only one who sins
[15:16] right
[15:17] a sinner is just sin there there he says
[15:19] that's what they are but a christian is
[15:21] the one who has the ability to backslide
[15:25] he's the one who has the die daily
[15:28] and the prophet says but notice that man
[15:30] who's never been born of the spirit of
[15:31] god
[15:32] he's just controlled or dominated
[15:36] by this by the devil
[15:38] because he says because that evil nature
[15:41] is on the throne room
[15:43] of his heart he's the one on the throne
[15:46] he's the one pushing the buttons he's
[15:48] the one pulling the levers you can
[15:49] change the outside of that man give him
[15:51] a good home raise him with a good family
[15:54] he'll have good morals you can get him
[15:56] to in a perfect you can construct that
[15:58] man to drive wear the right clothes talk
[16:01] the right talk
[16:02] have an image in front of people but
[16:04] until god changes the inside of that man
[16:07] the devil is still the one pushing the
[16:09] buttons and controlling the levers
[16:12] but brother baron says but when a man is
[16:14] born of the spirit of god the spirit of
[16:16] god comes in and it he says by a fiery
[16:20] experience it burns out that old nature
[16:23] it removes satan from the throne room
[16:26] and he says but it takes him from a
[16:28] place of dominion
[16:30] he said brother matt what's the
[16:31] difference between a man who's born
[16:32] again and a person who's not if we're
[16:34] two people the difference is is a person
[16:36] who's not been born of the spirit the
[16:38] control he's he's under the dominion of
[16:40] sin but when you're born again you
[16:42] remove satan from the position of throne
[16:45] room and he moves to a place of
[16:48] influence
[16:52] and now he's not the one in control but
[16:54] he'll always tell you that he is
[16:57] he's not the one in control but he's
[16:59] always the one there to try to influence
[17:01] you
[17:02] and to tell you to do the wrong things
[17:04] to look at the wrong things to say the
[17:06] wrong things to make the wrong choices
[17:09] and so brother madam says only a
[17:11] christian is the only one who says now i
[17:13] know people categorize sin you know they
[17:15] put pornography up here and then pride
[17:18] is somewhere down on the scale and
[17:20] an addiction to alcohol is way up here
[17:23] and then
[17:24] lying is somewhere down here and then
[17:25] bitterness is somewhere down here you
[17:27] know people love to categorize
[17:29] sin
[17:31] but did you know in god's eyes they're
[17:33] all the same
[17:34] right
[17:35] that's right
[17:36] and god's eyes how god views it it's all
[17:38] brother of adam said there's only one
[17:39] sin the sin of unbelief
[17:42] so you you remove you come out of
[17:44] satan's dominion
[17:46] from what's controlling you
[17:48] and then satan moves to a place of
[17:50] influence
[17:52] in your life
[17:54] the holy ghost comes in and removes that
[17:56] snake off the throne and now the dove is
[17:59] in control so listen to how brother and
[18:02] we're just going to go through this and
[18:03] we'll we'll continue through some of
[18:04] this and skip we'll go back and forth i
[18:06] hope that's okay here tonight
[18:08] but i want you to notice here the the
[18:10] prophet of god let's just pick up the
[18:12] powerpoint if you could brother john
[18:14] he says when it comes forth and he says
[18:16] the i mean yeah when it comes forth and
[18:18] it's no more cockaburra but wheat but
[18:21] while it's here on earth go back to the
[18:23] previous slide if you could that's where
[18:25] i wanted to be and he says but notice
[18:28] the bold but the nature of the cocklebur
[18:30] is still sticky and it will be until
[18:34] this new life
[18:36] has fully been developed
[18:40] out of the ground and raised up again
[18:44] when it comes forth then it's no more
[18:47] cuckleber but wheat
[18:49] but while it's here on earth
[18:52] and in the out of the earth and a
[18:54] cocklebur it's still
[18:57] sticky
[18:58] prickly for arizonians and sticky for
[19:01] humid south carolina
[19:03] it's still sticky
[19:05] but it's got the nature on the inside of
[19:08] it of wheat
[19:11] and as long as you're in this life how
[19:14] many still in this life
[19:16] you're going to be sticky and have a
[19:19] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[19:22] as long as you
[19:24] live
[19:26] but the inside of you you're born again
[19:30] and when you're raised up you're in the
[19:32] likeness of christ and what's he
[19:34] speaking of raised up in the
[19:35] resurrection that's why paul said we
[19:36] know not what we shall be when he shall
[19:38] appear but we know this we shall be like
[19:41] him in his very image
[19:43] because now it's not just a change that
[19:45] happens in the soul but the whole body's
[19:47] been changed
[19:48] and so brother the man says but as long
[19:50] as you're in this life you're going to
[19:52] be sticky but on the inside he says when
[19:54] you're raised up you say to the man
[19:56] when's that going to happen when am i
[19:58] really going to be fully changed brother
[20:00] branham says when the life has fully
[20:03] been developed
[20:05] in other words when you turn 18 for the
[20:07] second time
[20:10] that's when some of you say i'm just
[20:12] waiting to turn 18. don't worry you'll
[20:14] you will one day 18 19 years old
[20:18] when brother branham says when that when
[20:20] that life has fully been developed
[20:24] he says again christ all the sin is
[20:26] going from you that's the thing
[20:28] so the prophet of god uh takes the time
[20:30] here and even the the scripture i'm just
[20:32] gonna stop here for a moment just to
[20:34] pause that if you could just for a
[20:36] moment
[20:36] the prophet of god begins to talk about
[20:38] this and
[20:39] the the way you say how did i how do i
[20:41] end up this way and i'm a i'm a strange
[20:44] creature and i've got parts of me if i'd
[20:46] be honest if i'd be honest really honest
[20:49] with myself
[20:51] i have the potential inside of my carnal
[20:54] flesh to be carnal to not live like not
[20:57] live like the word i can get cold
[21:02] i can get i could get distant from the
[21:04] lord my prayer life can get stale
[21:07] well maybe not in arizona but i'm just
[21:09] going to be honest that's how it is back
[21:11] home are you you guys the same way
[21:14] so listen to what the bible says
[21:16] and you can you can say well brother man
[21:18] how did i get that way well you know we
[21:20] can talk about the the the beginning of
[21:22] the origin of sin and how sin began and
[21:25] in the fall in the garden of eden and
[21:26] how you know the plan of redemption and
[21:28] you know we could we could analyze and
[21:30] people love to analyze and say how am i
[21:33] this way and break me down but brother
[21:34] branham makes it very simple you're made
[21:36] up of body you're made up of soul you're
[21:38] made up of spirit and inside of that
[21:40] soul there's the real you
[21:43] but the struggle comes with this war
[21:46] between what's on the inside and what's
[21:49] on the outside
[21:52] and people who get cancer
[21:54] they're not they're not interested in
[21:55] how did i get cancer and where did it
[21:58] start and let's get a microscope and
[21:59] let's analyze cancer and how does it
[22:01] begin and it talks about a cell how that
[22:03] a cell crashes into another cell and
[22:05] then you know but a person who has
[22:06] cancer they don't want to know how to
[22:08] they how they got it they just want to
[22:10] know how can i be free
[22:12] and i believe a true son or daughter of
[22:13] god can say i i just want to be free
[22:16] i want to have freedom in christ
[22:18] so brother branham the the scripture
[22:20] here the bible says in romans 3 verse 9
[22:23] it says all men
[22:25] somebody say oh with me
[22:28] all men
[22:30] alike
[22:31] are sinners
[22:33] whether jew or gentile all men all
[22:36] humanity
[22:37] everybody alike everybody's included no
[22:40] big eye no little you no last names
[22:42] doesn't matter
[22:44] all men alike are sinners
[22:48] the bible sets the record straight no
[22:50] one is innocent no one
[22:54] no one is good romans 3 10 and this is
[22:57] the living bible it says no one is good
[22:59] no one in all the world is innocent no
[23:02] one has really ever truly followed god's
[23:05] paths or even truly wanted to everyone
[23:09] has turned away all have gone wrong
[23:14] love how this man professor jordan
[23:16] peterson that you can read you can watch
[23:18] his conversion through his wife's
[23:20] testimony was once an atheist now
[23:23] believes in god and it's pretty powerful
[23:25] when you watch his testimonies he begins
[23:26] to break down and cry and he made a
[23:28] profound statement he said you know the
[23:31] truth of the matter is is that no one
[23:33] has really ever truly been a christian
[23:37] except christ
[23:40] the only true christian
[23:43] was christ
[23:45] no one has
[23:47] anywhere has ever
[23:49] kept no one is innocent no one is
[23:50] followed he says everyone is turned away
[23:52] this is romans 3 10. all have gone wrong
[23:55] no one anywhere has kept on doing what
[23:57] is right not no not one
[24:01] from the soul of the feet isaiah 1 6
[24:03] even unto the head there is no soundness
[24:06] about us jeremiah 17 the heart is
[24:09] deceitful and desperately wicked above
[24:11] all else who can know it
[24:13] listen friends we're all grouped in this
[24:16] thing together there's not one of us
[24:18] that is better than the next one
[24:21] come on be honest sometimes we need to
[24:22] lose our pride and our dignity of who we
[24:25] are and make an honest confession within
[24:28] me as two people and within the flesh
[24:31] there's nothing good
[24:37] clean up on all three all those halos
[24:39] and angel wings could the deacons go and
[24:41] clean those up
[24:44] no one he says there's no one
[24:48] that's good
[24:49] brother random answers this and you can
[24:51] pull up the powerpoint here
[24:54] notice how he says this he says
[24:57] somebody told me this is he's speaking
[24:59] about the indian chief and he goes
[25:01] through a prayer line and and billy's
[25:03] only taking the serious cases and
[25:05] brother madam's instructed him only give
[25:06] cards out to the people with real
[25:08] diseases and and the man comes up and
[25:10] brother billy paul asks what's wrong and
[25:12] he says me sick me sick and he said
[25:14] that's the only english he knew and he
[25:16] comes through and brother madam says
[25:18] years later the man he heard he was
[25:19] converted and he said someone told me at
[25:22] one time he's converted received the
[25:23] holy ghost and he said to him how are
[25:26] you getting along and he said
[25:28] pretty good
[25:29] and pretty bad
[25:31] if you'd be honest if i asked you how
[25:32] you're doing tonight that's how you'd
[25:34] answer too
[25:36] how's your life how's your spiritual
[25:38] life doing pretty good
[25:40] and pretty bad
[25:44] and he says and he's a pretty good
[25:45] pretty bad he said well how do you mean
[25:47] pretty good and pretty bad and pretty
[25:49] good
[25:51] he said well since me received the holy
[25:54] ghost he said there's been two dogs in
[25:57] me and one of them a black dog and one
[26:00] of them a white dog and said they argue
[26:03] all the time
[26:06] said they growl and fight at one another
[26:09] and said the white dog wants me to do
[26:11] good and the black dog wants me to do
[26:13] bad
[26:14] he said well chief
[26:16] which one of them wins the fight
[26:19] said that depends on which one chief
[26:21] feeds the most
[26:25] so that's that said it depends on which
[26:28] one chief feeds the most so i think
[26:31] that's a good answer listen
[26:33] this is how brother branham answers
[26:37] romans 7.
[26:40] we're not talking about now i know you
[26:42] say brother matt what about the part of
[26:43] you i'm not talking about romans 8 the
[26:45] part of you that there is there now no
[26:47] condemnation which to them which are in
[26:49] christ who walked on after the flesh but
[26:51] walk after the spirit for the flesh is
[26:53] dead that's a part of you
[26:55] but this is the other part of you
[26:58] and he says it i think that's a good
[27:00] answer there just depends i love this on
[27:04] the warring of the body
[27:07] that's in you
[27:09] it depends on which one you cater to
[27:14] which nature you cater to the carnal
[27:17] nature after the things of the world or
[27:20] the spiritual nature after the things of
[27:22] god that does it and i believe that's
[27:24] what does it today which one do you
[27:27] choose to feed will determine how
[27:30] healthy you are spiritually and how much
[27:33] victory you have what's the problem i
[27:35] don't understand which one are you
[27:37] feeding
[27:39] which one are you catering to the most
[27:42] the prophet of god says that does it
[27:44] listen ellie says this if you went into
[27:46] a doctor's office you can go to the next
[27:48] slide that's just fine he says if you
[27:50] were if you went into a doctor's office
[27:53] and told him you were sick and told him
[27:54] your symptoms and he was in a hurry let
[27:56] me let me pause that thank you brother
[27:58] brother john sorry i'm gonna i'm just
[27:59] gonna read you something that i have
[28:01] here on my notes i didn't have time to
[28:03] put this but i just want to take the
[28:04] time to read it to you listen what
[28:06] brother branham says
[28:08] and he says a devil is almost this is
[28:10] the greatest battle ever fought 1962 in
[28:12] march devil is almost harmless unless he
[28:17] can have something to work in
[28:20] you remember those devils that were cast
[28:22] out of legion
[28:24] they wanted to do more mischievousness
[28:25] so they wanted to go into the hogs so
[28:28] devils must have something to work in
[28:32] somebody to work through so i'm born of
[28:34] the spirit of god how much
[28:36] access does the devil have to me as much
[28:41] as you give him
[28:44] how much can the devil get in me even
[28:46] after i'm born of the spirit of god as
[28:48] much as you allow him as much channels
[28:51] you open up and avenues you say well
[28:54] i've never i'm not going down to the bar
[28:56] i'm not going down to meet the guy on
[28:58] the street to buy drugs yeah but are you
[29:00] allowing the conscience through grudges
[29:02] or through bitterness or through
[29:04] jealousies and you allow avenues for the
[29:06] devil to get in
[29:09] and the prophet of god says what's wrong
[29:11] with so many blown up christians they
[29:12] don't clean out the channels
[29:15] you're made up of more so what are you
[29:16] saying brother matt there's a part of
[29:18] you that's not the person in the mirror
[29:20] you're more than the person you see
[29:24] and he says he must have something to
[29:26] work in somebody to work through so the
[29:29] devil's tactic comes from within notice
[29:32] what does he use our memory our
[29:33] conscience our reasoning the past
[29:35] complexes memories pains hurts
[29:40] tribulations a believer goes through
[29:42] tribulations if he's a believer he does
[29:46] and satan can only his power he's got is
[29:49] the perverted power of god it isn't no
[29:50] real power adultery is an act misused a
[29:52] righteous act missed you see everything
[29:55] that satan has got is something that was
[29:57] perverted but it's a power and we are
[29:59] today sitting here one or the other
[30:02] power is going to control us
[30:05] i love this so let's cast out the evil
[30:08] one
[30:09] let's take our position like the stars
[30:11] of heaven
[30:13] and he says inside the body is a soul
[30:15] and in that soul is controlled by
[30:17] imaginations he's speaking of the spirit
[30:19] and he says it's controlled by
[30:21] imaginations conscience memory reasoning
[30:23] affections
[30:24] that's the thing that controls
[30:27] so what controls you
[30:29] maybe not your eyes but your temper
[30:34] maybe something deeper and this is what
[30:36] i'm trying to get to you i'm preaching
[30:37] on being changed here tonight
[30:39] something inside of you that's never
[30:42] really been surrendered fully
[30:47] to the lord jesus
[30:49] maybe something that inner man that
[30:51] control man doesn't have the lever to
[30:53] because you won't let him control it
[30:57] then what does that listen
[30:59] from the middle of the heart
[31:02] from there goes forth he speaks of it he
[31:04] says here from the middle of the heart
[31:06] the soul which we know brother what
[31:07] brother adam's meaning here and he says
[31:10] from there goes forth feeding every
[31:13] channel
[31:14] the trouble of it is we're standing here
[31:17] with a lot of doubt
[31:19] trying to accept what's out there you're
[31:21] trying to accept the promise of god for
[31:24] you he says but you're standing here
[31:25] with a lot of doubt or a lot of
[31:27] complexes
[31:28] or a lot of fears
[31:30] or a lot of pressure that people have
[31:32] put on you and expectations people have
[31:34] of you
[31:35] come on
[31:37] you've got to stop that and come down
[31:40] that channel with the true word of god
[31:44] what channel my memory my conscience my
[31:47] imagination my affection
[31:49] you've got to not feed it with the wrong
[31:52] things
[31:53] but feed it with the word of god
[31:56] he says then it goes out itself
[31:57] automatically it's what's on the inside
[32:00] that's the thing that counts as the
[32:02] inside he says satan's approach is from
[32:05] the inside
[32:07] aha
[32:09] aha
[32:11] now i know
[32:13] he's not going to get me down to the
[32:14] local bar down here
[32:16] he knows that
[32:18] he's not going to get me you know
[32:19] addicted to sudden you find me some that
[32:21] there's some certain part of you that's
[32:23] crossed over from death unto life
[32:26] and he knows he can't even reach you
[32:28] there
[32:29] so what does he do he starts like he did
[32:31] with legion brother branham says
[32:32] remember that wasn't his name he was a
[32:34] man had a family a children he had kids
[32:37] and his brother branham says maybe
[32:39] temper or something that he never really
[32:41] got under control
[32:44] and he starts with one
[32:46] and then it leads to two three four five
[32:48] six seven eight nine ten spirits twelve
[32:50] spirits fourteen two thousand demon
[32:53] spirits
[32:56] and where did it start from
[32:58] notice
[32:59] it starts brother adam says there's only
[33:01] one avenue listen to this there's only
[33:03] one avenue that can come down and that's
[33:05] by the way of free moral agency
[33:08] by your thoughts as a man thank us in
[33:11] his heart thinketh in his heart so is he
[33:14] if you say to this mountain move and
[33:15] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[33:16] what you've said will come to pass you
[33:17] could have what you have you get it
[33:18] congregation says amen
[33:21] there's the battleground if you'd only
[33:22] get started first see what it's covered
[33:25] over with you say well well these
[33:27] conscience a man says well this
[33:28] conscience and senses and so forth don't
[33:31] have anything to do with it brother
[33:32] branham certainly it does
[33:36] but if you let the word come in
[33:39] and cover it over with the cover of the
[33:42] conscience then it can grow
[33:44] you see he says then he says if you let
[33:46] it cover it over he says if you let the
[33:48] word let me reread that if you let the
[33:51] word come in and then cover it over
[33:54] with memory and conscience and hurt
[33:57] feelings and complexes then it can't
[33:59] grow
[34:01] it'll be a deformed word
[34:05] did you ever see a crooked plant brother
[34:07] branham says and he says a corn of wheat
[34:09] and he says a corn a corn planted in the
[34:11] ground and let a stick fall over it
[34:14] it'll grow crooked
[34:16] any vine anything that grows up because
[34:18] something
[34:19] has hindered it
[34:22] you see crops and every single one of
[34:24] them straight up and straight up and
[34:25] straight up but then he says i notice
[34:27] one and another place brother branham
[34:28] talks about this and he says i seen one
[34:30] and it was he says it was just grown and
[34:32] it sort of went this way then it weaved
[34:34] around this way and it went up this way
[34:36] and it went over here and brother venom
[34:38] says somewhere in its life
[34:40] a branch had fallen down over top of it
[34:44] and he says and then what happened he
[34:46] says it affected or hindered the growth
[34:48] of that plant now the miracle
[34:51] is that it survived
[34:54] the miracle is that it was living
[34:58] the miracles that its hands was reached
[35:00] up to heaven in spite of all the
[35:02] crookedness and all the branches that it
[35:03] didn't ask for
[35:05] it didn't ask for that pain i didn't ask
[35:07] for that to happen when it was two or
[35:08] three years old and mom and dad got
[35:10] divorced and had no decision coming into
[35:12] it they grew up without a father father
[35:14] was an alcoholic what happened all those
[35:16] branches that that fell upon it deformed
[35:19] its life it didn't ask for any of those
[35:22] but the miracle is
[35:24] it's still alive
[35:27] and don't you ever let the devil
[35:28] discourage you over crooked plants and
[35:31] the things that have fallen upon your
[35:32] life the miracle is look around you
[35:36] you're still here
[35:39] you ought to rejoice and say in spite of
[35:41] everything i've came through in spite of
[35:44] every rock the devil's thrown at me he
[35:46] threw the everything he had at me but
[35:48] i'm still here i've got a desire to
[35:50] serve the lord i've got a desire to move
[35:52] on that's the miracle in spite of
[35:55] everything satan has thrown my way i
[35:57] still want to serve you lord.
[36:03] and he says he says it must be accepted
[36:05] in the mind now notice this and we we're
[36:07] we've got to move on from this but let's
[36:08] just let's just go back if you could
[36:11] brother john there in the powerpoint
[36:14] if you went into a doctor's office and
[36:16] told him you were sick and told him your
[36:18] symptoms and he was in a hurry he'd
[36:20] probably give you a little prescription
[36:22] with some anesthetic in it or some sort
[36:23] of aspirin
[36:25] the doctor is merely trying to get rid
[36:27] of you just at that time because he
[36:29] hasn't time
[36:30] but a real good doctor before he give
[36:33] you the medicine would diagnose that
[36:36] case thoroughly
[36:38] till he found out what was wrong
[36:42] then give you the medicine
[36:44] i'm afraid that's how people have
[36:45] treated uh how sometimes if we'd be
[36:47] honest how we treat other people we
[36:49] don't have time for you you know just
[36:50] take the gospel and that's all you need
[36:53] and i don't really have time for that we
[36:55] just take it brother man says the doctor
[36:57] who do that he doesn't care about you
[37:00] he doesn't care about you i've got
[37:02] enough well people i don't have time for
[37:04] all your problems and all the
[37:06] things going on in your life just give
[37:08] me some people that have that are
[37:09] problem free jesus didn't come to the
[37:12] well he came to the sick
[37:14] that's why he said does the whale need a
[37:16] physician why are you there with the
[37:17] drunks and the alcoholics and the
[37:19] prostitutes does the well need a
[37:21] physician no
[37:22] he came for the broken
[37:25] he came for the crooked he came for the
[37:28] messed up with issues
[37:30] can you say amen
[37:33] and he says he says but he'll thoroughly
[37:35] he'll thoroughly diagnose the case
[37:38] until he found out was what was wrong
[37:40] and then give you the medicine
[37:44] you can go to the next line and
[37:46] sometimes we find people going through
[37:48] these prayer lines out across the
[37:49] nations and they just run up and think
[37:51] that the lord ought to heal them right
[37:52] then but then there's something maybe
[37:54] down in there and we set before the lord
[37:56] until he reveals that that what it is
[37:59] there's something and i want you to key
[38:00] in on the statement i almost gave this
[38:02] my subtitle
[38:03] and just remember it throughout the rest
[38:05] of the sermon
[38:07] there's a reason
[38:10] for everything
[38:13] there's a reason
[38:16] for everything
[38:19] why am i this way why am i built this
[38:21] why does this trip me up and why am i
[38:23] this certain thing agitates me and i
[38:25] don't even you know a lot of times you
[38:27] don't understand yourself
[38:29] but remember there's a reason for
[38:32] everything
[38:35] and he says and you've got to find the
[38:38] reason first
[38:41] and then you can find out what to work
[38:44] on server that matt why why is that i
[38:48] want to just i want to say this because
[38:50] i believe it's so important to the
[38:52] substance of what i what the lord has
[38:54] put upon my heart in case i miss it i'm
[38:55] preaching to you
[38:56] on being changed
[38:59] being changed not just that you were
[39:01] changed one time
[39:03] but that you were you are being changed
[39:06] and let me just stop here and say when
[39:07] when you receive the spirit of god
[39:09] you're changed but there's a part of you
[39:12] that must of necessity
[39:14] be constantly be being changed
[39:20] you must
[39:21] you must you must you can't stop you
[39:25] can't stop and sit down you can't stop
[39:28] and pause for a moment you must
[39:31] constantly
[39:32] say lord continue to change me
[39:36] continue to grow me i don't care how far
[39:38] the lord has brought you in your
[39:40] marriage or your mind or your church or
[39:42] your spiritual life i don't care what
[39:44] place you've ever achieved and what
[39:46] height you've ever went to there's got
[39:48] to be something inside of you that says
[39:51] lord i've went this far but i need to go
[39:54] further i've climbed this high but i
[39:56] want to go higher lord you've got to
[39:59] constantly be in being evolved and
[40:01] changed and cleaned what are you saying
[40:04] brother matt the experience with god is
[40:06] not just a one-time event it's got to be
[40:09] a daily pouring out daily dying out a
[40:12] daily emptying out to say lord clean my
[40:14] mind clean my conscience
[40:17] clean my spirit if i've ingested
[40:19] something that you that's not according
[40:21] to your word let me cast it down lord
[40:26] that's why paul would say you did run
[40:28] well what did hinder you you've stopped
[40:30] be not entangled again with the yoke of
[40:33] bondage wherewith christ has already set
[40:36] you free
[40:39] you've got it constantly brother adam
[40:40] says clean out the channels
[40:43] and we didn't take time to read it
[40:44] brother adam says that's the what's
[40:45] wrong with so many blowed up christians
[40:48] like a boiler
[40:50] and he says you take a boiler and it
[40:51] says if the flu pipe if the exhaust is
[40:54] clogged up with things he says it builds
[40:56] up pressure and pressure and because
[40:58] life has a tendency if you haven't
[41:00] noticed your life as you get older you
[41:02] get more pressure and more pressure and
[41:04] more pressure
[41:06] and he says that boiler if he said if
[41:08] the flu is clogged and he says it just
[41:10] builds up and builds up and then
[41:12] boom
[41:15] and it blows
[41:17] and he says that's what's wrong with so
[41:18] many blowed up christians
[41:21] they never cleaned out the channels
[41:24] brother branham says what channels
[41:26] memory conscience reasoning imagination
[41:29] affection
[41:33] and he says you've got to clean them out
[41:35] you've got to let the spirit of the lord
[41:37] go in there and do a surgery sometimes
[41:39] open heart surgery
[41:42] sometimes it's got to open you back up
[41:44] and take something that you've never
[41:46] really fully listen there is a tool bag
[41:48] doctors have and they could take a touch
[41:50] they could come and and help you and and
[41:53] in ways uh
[41:54] and do and do things for you but there
[41:56] are certain tools that man doesn't have
[41:59] and only god has those tools and only
[42:02] god can come into the parts of your
[42:03] heart and heal the pieces of you that
[42:06] are that are causing issues
[42:09] and if we'd be honest we all have them
[42:13] and brother branham says to let
[42:15] everything it's got to be cleaned out
[42:17] you've got to be constantly cleaning out
[42:19] constantly clearing out
[42:22] right
[42:23] constantly growing
[42:25] constantly moving
[42:27] you can't stop
[42:30] ever moving on i've tasted of the lord
[42:33] but you've got to need more you've got
[42:35] to have more i've been filled with the
[42:37] spirit but you have many refillings of
[42:40] his spirit
[42:42] i'd say give me one every day lord every
[42:43] day i put my feet on this earth refill
[42:45] me again lord
[42:48] so brother branham says this here and he
[42:50] comes to this and i just want to come
[42:52] here
[42:54] it's not a one-off and so let's let's go
[42:56] back to the slides that's that's good
[42:58] we'll go back
[43:00] brother branham says and sometimes we
[43:02] find people going through these prayer
[43:04] lines out across the nation we've read
[43:05] that there's a reason for everything and
[43:07] he says you've got to find the reason
[43:09] first and then you can find what to work
[43:11] on i found someone not program excuse me
[43:13] on the interviews this morning says
[43:15] questions and answers august 30th
[43:17] i guess they're still here in the
[43:18] building
[43:20] about speaking with tongues
[43:22] that person is a genuine person a real
[43:24] person and they've lived right
[43:26] they've heard me say the evidence of the
[43:28] holy ghost wasn't speaking in tongues
[43:30] and it isn't
[43:31] notice this
[43:33] but i advise that person to ask god to
[43:36] let them either speak in tongues or
[43:38] prophesy
[43:40] why brother branham
[43:42] because
[43:44] it's the nature
[43:47] now you've just spent the entire service
[43:50] that morning brother branham spends and
[43:52] talks about the evidence of the holy
[43:53] ghost isn't speaking in tongues and he
[43:54] says but now i've told this lady she's a
[43:57] genuine person a real person lived right
[44:00] and he says but i told her i advise you
[44:01] to ask the lord to let you speak in
[44:03] tongues or prophesy
[44:05] why would you advise that person because
[44:08] it's the nature
[44:10] so he's seen something inside of this
[44:12] woman that he knew that the nature that
[44:15] was inside of her maybe you're not that
[44:17] way but she was built a certain way to
[44:19] where until something outwardly took
[44:22] place in her life brother branham knew
[44:24] she would always live in constant
[44:26] questioning and struggling and always
[44:28] wondering
[44:29] so you know what we do with those kind
[44:31] of cases we complicate them and make
[44:33] them
[44:34] some kind of mystery but brother branham
[44:36] is just so simple says just ask the lord
[44:38] to let you speak in tongues
[44:42] let him ask the lord i'd advise you to
[44:43] do that why because it's the nature the
[44:46] first thing
[44:48] i went to that person and found their
[44:50] birthplace ah
[44:51] clue
[44:53] so you mean your birthplace and where
[44:55] you're born can have an effect on how
[44:58] you are and who you are as a person how
[45:00] you view god how you react to his word
[45:03] how you even receive a sermon that's
[45:05] preached and you hear certain things and
[45:06] you hear through your own experience and
[45:08] someone hears completely different than
[45:10] you
[45:11] and one person says he said this no i
[45:13] don't i've never heard brother matt say
[45:14] that well that's because the the filter
[45:17] of that person's history and their past
[45:19] and what this the things that god has
[45:21] had to bring them through they received
[45:23] something entirely different than what
[45:25] you did
[45:27] and he says i went to that person and
[45:30] found their birthplace and what sign
[45:33] they were born under
[45:35] and could tell what their birth was
[45:37] which way it set in their natural nature
[45:42] set them
[45:43] in a certain line
[45:48] what house she was you say brother matt
[45:50] the birth has where you're born has
[45:52] absolutely what house she was born in
[45:56] the mother and father she had the
[45:58] teachers that she had in her life you
[46:00] say that's important oh absolutely
[46:02] brother and preachers the message
[46:04] leadership and remember he says now you
[46:06] started out as a little baby and he says
[46:08] you started out in the arms of your
[46:10] mother and he says and in the arms of
[46:12] that mother you experience the love of
[46:14] god
[46:17] you know what the real love of a real
[46:18] mother is experiencing that baby's
[46:20] experiencing the love of god through
[46:23] that mom
[46:24] and brother branham says that was your
[46:25] first time you came in contact to a true
[46:28] mother who truly loves that baby and
[46:30] brother bannon says then from the
[46:31] mother's arms eventually you you change
[46:34] dispensations and you go into the
[46:36] dispensation of your father and he says
[46:39] now he still loves you
[46:41] dad dad's he said it's still the love of
[46:43] god but maybe a little more corrective
[46:44] than what mama was
[46:46] his brother diggs says every family has
[46:49] law and grace
[46:52] and his mom was a police officer so
[46:54] yeah she had law
[46:58] and brother adam says then you go from
[46:59] there from your mother then you go into
[47:01] the father and he says then you go from
[47:03] the father and you graduate from there
[47:04] and all all of those things from your
[47:06] father is passing down unto you are
[47:08] passed from his father and then things
[47:10] and trade and teaching and principles of
[47:12] life are passed from their father and
[47:14] you're you're taking all of those things
[47:16] in
[47:18] and then you move from the mother to the
[47:19] father then you move to the teacher
[47:21] brother branham says maybe your sunday
[47:22] school teacher received you then or your
[47:24] teacher's in class and they molded you
[47:26] the experiences that you went through
[47:28] the things that you've seen that others
[47:30] didn't see the feelings that you felt
[47:31] that others didn't feel
[47:33] and he says and you you go from there
[47:35] and you move from dispensation all of
[47:36] those things then your employer then
[47:38] your career then your job and all of
[47:41] those things make up who you are
[47:47] and brother branham says now watch what
[47:48] happens if that child never receives the
[47:51] love of the mother he says that void
[47:54] that child was created with a void in
[47:56] his heart you're born in sin you're
[47:58] created with a void and brother branham
[48:00] says if that child never receives the
[48:02] love from that mother a true mother's
[48:04] love or the father and you never really
[48:07] portray the love of christ to that child
[48:10] brother branham says it this way he says
[48:11] then that child will go and fill that
[48:14] void with some violent substitute that
[48:18] the devil gives him
[48:21] and you watch
[48:22] people that have strayed away from the
[48:24] lord because they were never filled with
[48:26] that's why it's so important as parents
[48:29] that we say lord let my projection of
[48:32] you be a projection that's true that's
[48:35] pure that's undefiled
[48:37] let me express the love of christ how
[48:39] many would say that let me project the
[48:41] love of christ
[48:43] to my children so that i leave an
[48:45] imprint not of my complexes and not of
[48:47] my struggles and not of my troubles and
[48:49] not of my issues i don't want to imprint
[48:52] them i'm going to by default already i'm
[48:54] going to but lord let me imprint them
[48:56] with the love of christ
[49:02] and so brother branham says notice what
[49:04] happened her birthplace which way set
[49:06] their nature natural way sets them in a
[49:08] certain line
[49:10] where they're born the leaders that they
[49:12] came under
[49:14] so notice he says then when they're born
[49:16] again they're over here in another
[49:18] nature then when you find in this nature
[49:19] that's the inside in conscience inside
[49:21] conscience go to the next slide it's
[49:23] been one of the most amazing things that
[49:25] i've noticed along the lines
[49:28] of my ministry for our lord jesus is the
[49:31] peculiarity of people and the study of
[49:33] human life is one of the greatest things
[49:35] that a person can study to watch nature
[49:38] of people
[49:40] go to the next line
[49:41] and the different parts of the nations
[49:43] and the worlds to see where you go
[49:45] you'll notice that there's a difference
[49:47] there's a different attitude that people
[49:48] take towards christ towards his servants
[49:51] towards a service towards his servants
[49:54] towards worship
[49:55] and one of the things has been that one
[49:57] type of meeting would just be wonderful
[50:00] in one part of the country where it
[50:01] won't work in the other part of the
[50:03] country
[50:05] because people are different
[50:08] right
[50:08] notice how he begins to say this in the
[50:10] next slide you can go brother he says
[50:12] excuse me sister let me just pull it up
[50:15] here excuse me sister
[50:17] i have to relax my mind once in a while
[50:19] now we'll be strangers i see that you're
[50:20] strictly a stranger to me you're far
[50:22] from you're from away from here you've
[50:24] come from another city you've got a lot
[50:26] of trouble on your heart
[50:28] it's the first thing he sees
[50:30] you get a lot of trouble
[50:31] on your heart
[50:33] and you've got heart trouble to begin
[50:36] with is that right
[50:37] this is 20th century prophet you can go
[50:39] back and watch this and the ladies
[50:41] saying yes brother branham is that right
[50:42] you got a lot of trouble there's a whole
[50:44] lot of blackness
[50:46] i see a black sheet
[50:49] keep following you like that remember
[50:51] that brother branham says that spirit
[50:52] that hung over him
[50:55] he says i see a black sheep following
[50:57] you like that
[50:59] oh
[51:01] it's a lie
[51:03] somebody's told a lie on you
[51:06] and that man was professing divine
[51:08] healing you hear the woman that sister
[51:10] says yes sir he said you was a witch
[51:13] yes
[51:14] is that true and you've got a whole stir
[51:16] in your church or something another
[51:18] about it is that right your pastor's
[51:20] sick right now he's got polio is that
[51:22] right yes sir sister don't pay no
[51:24] attention to what them people tell you
[51:26] they're lying the only thing's wrong
[51:28] with your heart is that nervous
[51:30] condition got your heart worked up go
[51:32] home in peace and god bless you you're
[51:34] all right god bless you you're not
[51:37] a witch
[51:40] so notice what happens this woman who's
[51:43] a believer who's a child of god a child
[51:45] of god a daughter of god has now
[51:47] ingested something in her spirit
[51:50] through a lie that was told on her and
[51:52] there's a black sheet she had no idea
[51:55] there was a spirit following her and
[51:57] influencing her and filtering everything
[52:00] in life and it was something someone
[52:02] told about her
[52:06] and where did it go not in her flesh
[52:08] when in her spirit
[52:10] and she's a child of god and brother
[52:12] branham now realizes that and something
[52:15] in her spirit is now causing something
[52:18] to be affected on her body
[52:21] so doctors have figured out with heart
[52:23] trouble with stress and anxiety and all
[52:25] the pressure that you're under that can
[52:27] eventually affect your body and the
[52:30] woman is living with a heart condition
[52:32] and it's not hereditary it's not
[52:34] something from bad diet it's from a
[52:36] spirit she took into a lie
[52:39] and now it's affecting her so much she's
[52:41] in a prayer line and notice it's not
[52:43] some hocus what does brother branham do
[52:45] it's not some great build up and some
[52:47] great hocus pocus he simply exposes the
[52:50] devil
[52:52] and you say what healing did the sister
[52:54] need all she needed was for the light of
[52:56] the word of god to shine on that lie
[53:00] with truth and she was free
[53:03] you say what do we need brother matt we
[53:05] need the light of the word to say god
[53:07] shine in every part of my being shine in
[53:10] my memory my conscience my reasoning and
[53:12] expose the devil for every lie that i've
[53:16] believed and taken into myself
[53:21] you're not a witch
[53:24] so simple
[53:26] that's a lie that's not who you are
[53:29] and just like that she's free
[53:33] you believe with all your heart
[53:34] believe god will heal you with that tbs
[53:36] holy praise foreign ask him lord jesus i
[53:38] pray you'll heal the woman may she get
[53:39] completely
[53:40] whole he cares do you care 1963 and then
[53:44] strangely i went to a place where i made
[53:46] an odd turn notice this
[53:48] instead of turning around there i went
[53:51] up to make a turn the lights flashed on
[53:53] a lovely couple on the outside two fine
[53:55] young ladies that i had just married two
[53:57] fine young ministers
[54:00] and satan after seeing the minister one
[54:02] of them was ministry being said and he
[54:04] took a life's companion right there at
[54:06] this altar they went away happily on
[54:08] their honeymoon and the enemy jumped on
[54:11] this young man
[54:14] now
[54:15] i'm saying this
[54:17] to express what i'm saying
[54:19] does he care
[54:23] you take a man
[54:24] a woman
[54:25] here you have a boy you have a girl so
[54:28] they get married two families two lives
[54:30] come together
[54:32] everything that's made up of those two
[54:33] lives their memory both have memory
[54:35] conscience reasoning imagination
[54:37] affection they're both made up of their
[54:39] past their history their home the
[54:40] atmosphere of their home their father
[54:42] their mother if they lived in a holy
[54:44] home if they lived in a home maybe a dad
[54:46] who didn't know the lord maybe mom who
[54:48] strayed maybe a divorced home all of
[54:50] those things their their complexes did
[54:52] the family come through this boy maybe
[54:54] his dad they had sorrow and maybe they
[54:56] lost a loved one through disease or some
[54:58] great horrible tragic thing and maybe
[55:00] this man was from another country and
[55:02] you take all of these things and you
[55:03] mold them all together and all of these
[55:06] all of this light these two lives and
[55:08] then you marry them together
[55:12] and with all of that baggage the devil
[55:15] now has avenues
[55:19] and they're one happily couple and they
[55:21] lived happily ever after
[55:23] but there was always those avenues of
[55:25] this young man of things that he never
[55:27] cleared out
[55:29] things that he never really let the
[55:31] healer come in and heal in his heart
[55:33] remember what brother brandon says if
[55:34] the doctor is merely trying to get away
[55:35] with get get he doesn't have time he'll
[55:37] just say just take an aspirin get out of
[55:39] my office here's the here's the pill and
[55:40] you know sometimes we're so
[55:42] quick to oh you just need the holy ghost
[55:44] you just need to go through a prayer
[55:46] line you just need an experience with
[55:47] god maybe they need all of the above
[55:49] but remember there's a reason for
[55:52] everything
[55:54] and a person who really cares i'm glad
[55:56] jesus really cared for me
[55:58] and he wasn't just there to say just
[56:00] accept it but he said i'm going to deal
[56:02] with you on whatever level that you're
[56:03] at we're going to go through and uncover
[56:06] all of the baggage
[56:07] and if you let me i'm going to heal
[56:09] every single part of it
[56:13] and this man this woman there all of
[56:15] these things and they come now the devil
[56:17] jumps on this man
[56:25] all of those
[56:26] all of those
[56:27] strains from the family and all of those
[56:30] complexes and i'm saying this to express
[56:32] what i'm saying does he care somehow
[56:34] with faith that wouldn't take no turn
[56:36] back return back here knowing that it
[56:38] was all the way over way in the east
[56:41] and he says in next next slide if you
[56:43] could all the way in the east here
[56:44] somewhere on their honeymoon
[56:48] we turned back and was sitting waiting i
[56:50] walked in find handsome young man his
[56:52] wife sitting on the outside crying
[56:53] hearing their little companion the other
[56:55] man and the other brother coming running
[56:56] which is a friend of this young man said
[56:58] oh brother branham such and such has
[57:00] happened went there and seen this
[57:02] handsome young man sitting there just in
[57:03] the peak of his life a leader of young
[57:05] men sitting there and satan bound him
[57:08] he never noticed but i took my hand to
[57:11] shake his hand his left to shake his
[57:12] hand with his hand right to see if some
[57:14] disease had plagued him but there was no
[57:16] sign of vibration coming right out of
[57:18] the room from praying and fasting and
[57:20] waiting upon the lord the anointing of
[57:22] the holy spirit was there and that's why
[57:24] it led us see and then seeing the shadow
[57:27] of darkness
[57:28] there it is again
[57:30] the shadow of darkness over him i never
[57:34] said what i was doing but in less than a
[57:36] couple of moments time it was all gone
[57:40] the coldness of his hands had left he
[57:42] was shouting and praising god notice a
[57:45] few minutes
[57:48] to find himself
[57:53] he goes on a honeymoon something jumps
[57:55] upon him now there's a stirred brother
[57:56] random doesn't give us the details of
[57:57] what it is but there's this blow up and
[57:59] then in a few minutes in an interview
[58:01] privately brother branham no doubt
[58:03] starts discerning things notice what he
[58:05] says and he says few minutes to find
[58:07] himself and here they sit right here
[58:08] this morning sit in the audience see how
[58:10] satan was trying to upset that young man
[58:14] by referring to him
[58:16] of some complex
[58:18] to be built back
[58:23] so something you say brother matt
[58:25] something that the lord has set me free
[58:27] from can be built oh trust me the devil
[58:30] will take any victory that you have any
[58:33] jericho's that are laying ruined and
[58:35] crushed in bricks and tatter you better
[58:38] believe it satan will start taking
[58:40] bricks and putting mortar and bricks and
[58:42] trying to rebuild that problem that god
[58:44] had set you free from and if you don't
[58:47] clean out the channels and if you don't
[58:49] obey what does the word say casting down
[58:52] every vain imagination and every thought
[58:54] that exalts itself above the knowledge
[58:56] of the word cast it down
[59:00] because if you don't you'll be right
[59:01] back in those same chains god set you
[59:03] free from
[59:06] some complex people back which the holy
[59:08] spirit knew and i seen it by vision but
[59:10] god cared for that man
[59:13] god cared for that young boy
[59:15] just coming a few moments ago a lady i
[59:18] seen her sitting here in the aisle with
[59:19] no just got a seat got her a seat some
[59:22] way and sat down she said nine years
[59:24] brother branham
[59:25] i've tried to get a hold of you
[59:28] and she said i'm so desperate
[59:31] nine years could you imagine
[59:34] i'm so desperate i hear laden couldn't
[59:36] even get a prayer card to be in the line
[59:39] the lady moved back and she said brother
[59:41] branham just a word with you standing
[59:43] there a vision broke over this fine
[59:45] looking young woman
[59:47] seemed that her heart
[59:49] was burdened
[59:51] and she was trying to work to make a
[59:53] living and a great thing happened back
[59:56] way back in the time of her parents
[1:00:01] that it caused this great thing to
[1:00:03] happen to her
[1:00:04] so something
[1:00:06] in the past
[1:00:08] was now affecting the present
[1:00:12] and for nine years she lives with this
[1:00:14] present problem that was something in
[1:00:16] the time of her parents
[1:00:19] brother branham says that it calls this
[1:00:21] great thing the lord jesus revealed and
[1:00:23] showed what it was and there in a
[1:00:24] moment's time took it from the woman she
[1:00:27] went around rejoicing and now sitting
[1:00:29] here in the audience with us rejoicing
[1:00:30] with tears as she's wiping her eyes now
[1:00:33] knowing that the truth of the thing was
[1:00:34] made known and that what that poor
[1:00:37] little neurotic woman that was so
[1:00:39] nervous she didn't know what to do with
[1:00:41] herself and thinking she was gone and
[1:00:44] there was no holy spirit and this is her
[1:00:46] last day if you ever felt the devil tell
[1:00:49] you there's no holy spirit for you and
[1:00:51] you've send your day of grace away
[1:00:53] you're not the only person the devil has
[1:00:55] tried to tell that lie to she had tried
[1:00:57] for nine years and was just about at the
[1:01:00] end of despair
[1:01:03] god cared for that little woman
[1:01:06] no one cares for what a time
[1:01:09] he does care
[1:01:11] when he was here on earth i say he cared
[1:01:13] for people
[1:01:14] so much till he healed their sick
[1:01:16] comforted their hearts told them about a
[1:01:18] place where he would go to prepare for
[1:01:20] them and would come again to receive
[1:01:21] them unto himself he cared for them and
[1:01:23] noticed he cared so much until when he
[1:01:25] knew he must leave in order to bring
[1:01:27] this great thing to us he said i'll not
[1:01:30] leave you comfortless but i'll send the
[1:01:32] holy spirit he shall continue my care
[1:01:34] for you
[1:01:36] until he returns there's no one
[1:01:38] cares
[1:01:40] like jesus
[1:01:43] knowing that he sent back the holy
[1:01:45] spirit to continue his comfort for
[1:01:46] people does he care certainly he does he
[1:01:49] was to continue to care for the people
[1:01:51] his people here on earth in the same
[1:01:53] manner that he cared for them when he
[1:01:55] was here
[1:01:57] does he care
[1:01:59] oh how he cares
[1:02:04] brother branham says something comes in
[1:02:05] on this man
[1:02:08] we we use multiple examples of this this
[1:02:11] spirit that was following them can i
[1:02:13] have just a few more minutes
[1:02:15] okay we're all right
[1:02:17] and he says something that came in on
[1:02:19] him something
[1:02:20] had some complex he was trying to build
[1:02:23] back up remember what brother bannon
[1:02:25] says there's a reason for everything as
[1:02:27] i've heard it said it's a powerful
[1:02:29] statement that your entire adult life
[1:02:32] that you live as an adult
[1:02:34] is just a reaction of your childhood
[1:02:38] so everything that you're made up all
[1:02:40] the good that happened all the bad that
[1:02:42] happened all of the good things all of
[1:02:44] the bad things
[1:02:45] things that you should have received
[1:02:47] that maybe you didn't like love or
[1:02:49] nurture or care
[1:02:51] things that you shouldn't have received
[1:02:53] that you did things you should have
[1:02:55] never seen or ever had to go through
[1:02:57] you know i believe that any person who
[1:02:59] goes through divorce any child who's the
[1:03:01] product of that is a living miracle
[1:03:05] it's what i believe
[1:03:06] to go through the brokenness of a home
[1:03:08] where there's not a dad or not a mom or
[1:03:10] there's an absent non-present remember
[1:03:13] brother branham says there's a reason
[1:03:15] for everything
[1:03:16] and sometimes you see what you see in a
[1:03:19] person sometimes it's just the tip of
[1:03:21] the iceberg it wasn't what sunk the
[1:03:23] titanic was not the tip of that iceberg
[1:03:26] it wasn't what you could see it's what
[1:03:28] you couldn't see
[1:03:31] it's what was underneath the water where
[1:03:34] they couldn't see is what took the
[1:03:35] titanic down
[1:03:37] and brother madam says remember there's
[1:03:39] a reason for everything they never clean
[1:03:41] out the channels the flu gets clogged up
[1:03:43] and then it builds pressure and it
[1:03:45] builds pressure and it may build
[1:03:46] pressure for one year two year three
[1:03:48] year four year five ten year anniversary
[1:03:50] 12 year anniversary 15 years married
[1:03:53] and that that black spirit that
[1:03:55] blackness is always there following
[1:03:59] you notice it's incredible
[1:04:02] because if you watch and it's a popular
[1:04:05] statement hurt people hurt people
[1:04:08] and you watch it's so so so amazing how
[1:04:11] pain becomes
[1:04:13] transcended pain and it just moves from
[1:04:15] one generation to the next generation to
[1:04:17] the next to the next
[1:04:18] even the prophet of god would say things
[1:04:20] like in cancer and he talks about how
[1:04:22] that all sin
[1:04:24] uh all
[1:04:25] is a result of sin
[1:04:26] and then brother adam says now maybe not
[1:04:28] your sin
[1:04:30] maybe not something that you ever did
[1:04:32] but generations past and and the prophet
[1:04:34] of god says he says there's a there's a
[1:04:37] there as we
[1:04:38] as we read it you've got to find the
[1:04:40] reason then you know what to work on
[1:04:43] you watch a child i was speaking with a
[1:04:45] brother back home
[1:04:46] single now and just lived a very hard
[1:04:49] life
[1:04:51] troubled from the time he was 13 or 14
[1:04:54] years old was some things that had taken
[1:04:56] place that should have never happened
[1:04:58] by a boy 13 or 14 years old and he grew
[1:05:01] up and and even even things today that
[1:05:04] he realizes
[1:05:05] that he's he's affected a certain way
[1:05:07] and he didn't understand why begin
[1:05:09] another man begin to describe how that
[1:05:11] he was he he couldn't understand himself
[1:05:14] because he would uh
[1:05:17] his his wife would begin to cry and what
[1:05:20] was incredible is that he goes back in
[1:05:22] his history and as a as a little boy has
[1:05:25] lived in a troubled home and the mom the
[1:05:28] dad was always gone and the mom would
[1:05:30] just begin to weep and he'd always come
[1:05:32] in the room not really knowing what was
[1:05:33] wrong but there's mom she's crying she's
[1:05:36] at her bed and and and and and he's
[1:05:38] comforting her and he's telling her ally
[1:05:40] you know mom it's okay and he's i think
[1:05:42] he's at that time uh eight or nine years
[1:05:44] old and saying mom it's okay it's all
[1:05:46] right it's gonna be okay and she's just
[1:05:48] weeping and is there comforting and
[1:05:50] comforting and comforting and comforting
[1:05:51] this mom
[1:05:52] and then they go through that the life
[1:05:54] he lives up that way and years go on and
[1:05:57] he's older and he's 19 20 years old and
[1:05:59] he gets married and he loves his wife
[1:06:01] and she loves him and he just adores her
[1:06:03] and they're just a beautiful couple but
[1:06:05] every time she would go to start crying
[1:06:07] immediately he would just become
[1:06:09] he couldn't understand it he was
[1:06:10] embarrassed to even say it i don't know
[1:06:12] why i should never get irritated right
[1:06:16] you know and she's crying he says that
[1:06:17] should never bother me but for some
[1:06:18] reason i didn't understand why was it
[1:06:20] that i was so bothered by this
[1:06:23] and i'd never admit it but i would
[1:06:24] almost just want to say no no no don't
[1:06:26] don't stop crying don't cry
[1:06:28] and he didn't realize
[1:06:30] that because he had spent as a boy
[1:06:33] comforting a mother and that wasn't the
[1:06:35] job of that boy remember first
[1:06:37] corinthians 2 corinthians 12 i think it
[1:06:39] is it says behold the child children
[1:06:41] should not ought not to provide for the
[1:06:43] parents but the parents ought to provide
[1:06:44] for the children
[1:06:46] that's not just speaking of a job or
[1:06:48] financially but it's in every way that
[1:06:50] the parents are to provide a child
[1:06:52] shouldn't have to provide comfort for a
[1:06:54] mother but the mother should for the
[1:06:55] children and he said i didn't understand
[1:06:58] it brother maddie says but as a boy he
[1:07:00] says i was completely empty my tank was
[1:07:02] empty of comfort because i had given it
[1:07:04] all to my mom
[1:07:07] and i said well what did you do brother
[1:07:09] he said that's all
[1:07:11] he said all it took was for me to
[1:07:13] realize
[1:07:14] the issue
[1:07:16] i asked the lord lord would you change
[1:07:18] it would you heal that part of me and he
[1:07:20] said it was gone just like that
[1:07:23] nether never bothered me again why
[1:07:26] why
[1:07:27] because he's a man made up of memory
[1:07:29] conscience reason imagination affection
[1:07:31] two of me
[1:07:34] it's incredible brother branham begins
[1:07:36] to talk about this and if you could just
[1:07:37] go can i have ten minutes is that okay
[1:07:40] i heard the pastor
[1:07:42] say okay say amen so good
[1:07:44] all right all right that's good enough
[1:07:46] for me i'll take it
[1:07:48] pull up the the other one that you have
[1:07:50] brother john i want you to notice how
[1:07:51] brother brandon begins to deal with a
[1:07:53] very similar situation and just watch
[1:07:55] how the prophet of god just
[1:07:59] answers this question as a man and woman
[1:08:01] come to the prophet and they ask him ask
[1:08:03] brother branham about their boy
[1:08:05] and they're asking him saying what's we
[1:08:07] just don't know what's a matter with him
[1:08:09] he's a good he's good he loves the lord
[1:08:12] you know he's he's been to the altar and
[1:08:14] brother branham says this in a paradox
[1:08:16] perfect title
[1:08:17] you're going to see why here in a minute
[1:08:18] he says for instance a few days ago i
[1:08:20] was called in
[1:08:21] the scene on a little something going on
[1:08:23] there was a fine young man very fine
[1:08:24] young boy he was going with a little
[1:08:26] girl very fine little girl on a fine
[1:08:28] family and this boy all of a sudden came
[1:08:30] up with some kind of an idea and just
[1:08:32] walked away he did something wrong with
[1:08:33] the little girl and as much as promised
[1:08:35] her to do a certain thing and then
[1:08:36] didn't do it and instead of coming to
[1:08:38] the girl and apologizing like a
[1:08:40] gentleman should do
[1:08:42] it just wasn't in him
[1:08:44] to do it to do what to apologize
[1:08:48] just wasn't in him to do it the father
[1:08:51] and mother called me to the scene and
[1:08:53] said we would desire to know what's
[1:08:54] wrong with our boy now it's not easy to
[1:08:56] do something but you must be truthful
[1:08:58] and honest
[1:09:00] therefore the boy notice was a christian
[1:09:03] as far as a believer
[1:09:05] he had repented and had been baptized he
[1:09:07] had had his position among believers but
[1:09:10] yet had not received the baptism of the
[1:09:12] holy spirit no matter how much he
[1:09:15] thought he had you thinking you have and
[1:09:17] have in it is two different things
[1:09:21] you might be able to try to say you have
[1:09:22] and you might be able to show some
[1:09:23] evidence of some emotion but unless your
[1:09:26] life is vindicating what you're
[1:09:28] professing to have you still haven't got
[1:09:30] it no matter how many emotions how much
[1:09:32] you jump run sensations speaking in
[1:09:34] tongues or shouting whatever you might
[1:09:36] lay it upon which is all right i believe
[1:09:38] in all that but unless your life copes
[1:09:41] with your testimony
[1:09:44] you still haven't got it because the
[1:09:45] fruit of the spirit vindicates what you
[1:09:47] are just like the fruit of any tree
[1:09:48] tells what it is jesus said by their
[1:09:50] fruits you shall know them now this
[1:09:52] young fellow's parents his mother is
[1:09:55] german
[1:09:56] no reflection on the german but there is
[1:09:59] a strain in that family and that is
[1:10:02] they'll just sit
[1:10:03] and you can talk to them and they'll
[1:10:05] just stare stare you right in the face
[1:10:08] this girl's sister the mother of this
[1:10:10] boy her sister i've come down the street
[1:10:12] many morning and this young lady sitting
[1:10:14] out in the yard i'd say good morning to
[1:10:17] you and she'd just look at me
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:22] i'd say
[1:10:23] sure a fine morning
[1:10:25] she would just stand and look right at
[1:10:26] you
[1:10:28] an intelligent woman i'd say
[1:10:30] come up to see us sometime
[1:10:32] she'd just stand and look
[1:10:35] a lot of people in church do that too
[1:10:38] well our brothers are that way notice
[1:10:40] the father and mother is that way now
[1:10:44] the father of the boy is strictly an
[1:10:46] irishman
[1:10:48] moody
[1:10:49] high tempered
[1:10:50] brother branham's family is actually who
[1:10:52] he's talking about here
[1:10:53] hi strong this is his this is brother
[1:10:55] adam's family he doesn't tell that on
[1:10:57] tape he does but brother billy paul says
[1:10:59] this is this is actually who he's
[1:11:00] speaking of is his own family the boy's
[1:11:02] family he's irish he's moody he's high
[1:11:05] temper notice the mother's german she
[1:11:07] stares
[1:11:08] he says now the father of the mo of the
[1:11:10] boy is strictly an irishman moody high
[1:11:13] tempered high strung that's his whole
[1:11:15] family's like that except one other out
[1:11:18] of the family converted now in this boy
[1:11:22] this father and mother both are
[1:11:25] christians filled with the holy ghost
[1:11:27] and they have brought this young man up
[1:11:28] in some and he says brought this man up
[1:11:30] in the way of the lord and now the young
[1:11:32] man is about 17 or 18 years old
[1:11:34] something along there very fine kid he's
[1:11:36] been a real model boy at home nice kid
[1:11:38] and he's got a brother that's just vice
[1:11:39] versa but the girls the mother's family
[1:11:42] lives close to a fine church but do you
[1:11:45] think they'd ever come over there no
[1:11:49] they know it they know it's right
[1:11:52] but it's just not in them to ask
[1:11:54] forgiveness or ask
[1:11:56] pardoning
[1:11:59] there's a good church but they won't go
[1:12:01] to it because it's not in them to say
[1:12:04] can you forgive me
[1:12:06] now what's incredible is brother
[1:12:08] branham's ass they're asked about this
[1:12:10] boy he has this issue and he has this
[1:12:12] issue with this girl and rather than
[1:12:15] brother branham even dylan he just takes
[1:12:16] the boy and sets him to the side and
[1:12:18] said no no let's not talk about the boy
[1:12:20] let's talk about his mom let's talk
[1:12:22] about his dad
[1:12:23] because he's a product of everything
[1:12:25] that's been put inside of him
[1:12:28] and you're a product of everything that
[1:12:30] was put inside of them
[1:12:31] they know it's right it's just not in
[1:12:33] them to ask for forgiveness or ask party
[1:12:34] they just won't do it it's just not
[1:12:38] in them
[1:12:40] now the genes in this father and the
[1:12:42] mother of this boy no matter how much
[1:12:45] they are converted
[1:12:47] still remains the flesh
[1:12:49] that's been interbred out to this boy
[1:12:53] therefore the boy has got a complex in
[1:12:55] him just like from his mother's family
[1:12:58] and they are not forgiving they will not
[1:13:00] apologize and that's where the boy
[1:13:03] stands
[1:13:05] now i said to the father no matter how
[1:13:07] much you've raised him up i said now
[1:13:09] look at you out of your family all of
[1:13:11] them drunks and fighting and shooting
[1:13:14] and cutting and so forth he looks at the
[1:13:16] mom he says now look at your family to
[1:13:18] the mother there are a bunch of people
[1:13:20] just sit there and won't speak very
[1:13:22] independent and so forth irreverent to
[1:13:24] religion
[1:13:26] but i said
[1:13:27] it's not you
[1:13:30] you're the only one of all your sisters
[1:13:34] and brothers and your sweet
[1:13:37] kind forgiving
[1:13:39] i love this
[1:13:40] what does that
[1:13:43] and your tree part of the family tree
[1:13:46] yet you have received the holy ghost
[1:13:49] that's the thing that made you tender
[1:13:51] and sweet
[1:13:53] i love this it's not your people anymore
[1:13:58] it's your christ that lives in you
[1:14:03] it's not your people anymore
[1:14:06] what changes you
[1:14:08] it's your christ that lives inside of
[1:14:11] you
[1:14:13] i said to the boy look at you look at
[1:14:15] your family practically all of them are
[1:14:17] drunks and so forth i said and how moody
[1:14:19] and how high tempered and how i strung
[1:14:21] but you're not
[1:14:23] you're kind forgiving what is it
[1:14:27] the holy spirit you're no more what you
[1:14:31] are
[1:14:31] hallelujah
[1:14:33] it's christ in you
[1:14:36] now i said that same thing has to happen
[1:14:40] to your son
[1:14:42] it's not your people any
[1:14:46] more
[1:14:48] all of the crooked all of the things
[1:14:49] that have fallen on me all of the things
[1:14:51] that has been passed generationally all
[1:14:54] of the complexes all of the things i've
[1:14:56] ingested all of the things i've taken in
[1:14:58] here's the news tonight you can be free
[1:15:01] of every single last one of them you
[1:15:05] don't have to live with them another
[1:15:08] moment
[1:15:09] it's not your people anymore well i'm
[1:15:12] just this way brother matt i was just
[1:15:14] born that don't you believe a lie from
[1:15:16] the devil to get you to accept that to
[1:15:18] rebuild that complex back in your life
[1:15:21] well i'm just from this part of the
[1:15:22] country i'm just i'm i'm listen you're
[1:15:25] not an american
[1:15:27] hello somebody
[1:15:29] you're from a citizenship above
[1:15:33] you're you're you're you say where's my
[1:15:34] character come from my father which is
[1:15:36] in heaven
[1:15:39] he says and the father raised up said my
[1:15:41] son went to the altar he was baptized
[1:15:42] correctly in the name of jesus christ
[1:15:44] water baptism in the pool i know my son
[1:15:46] has come to christ i said that may be
[1:15:48] all right all the outward motions he
[1:15:50] might be identified as a believer with
[1:15:52] the believers but until he's been
[1:15:54] regenerated born again
[1:15:55] i'd advise the young man never to marry
[1:15:57] a woman he'll make hell on earth for her
[1:16:04] being changed there's a necessity
[1:16:08] a need
[1:16:09] to say lord
[1:16:11] i need to be changed
[1:16:14] oh that's my message so simple i want
[1:16:16] you just to receive it here tonight
[1:16:18] something where a heart would just say
[1:16:20] lord
[1:16:21] i need to be changed
[1:16:23] i'm going to admit it
[1:16:25] i'm going to own it the first sign of
[1:16:26] the first step to deliverance is
[1:16:28] recognition that lord i'm the one in
[1:16:31] need of prayer
[1:16:33] i'm the one in need brother adam says
[1:16:34] he'd make hell on earth for her until
[1:16:37] that gentle
[1:16:38] sweet
[1:16:40] forgiving spirit of christ comes in
[1:16:43] i read those words and i just raised up
[1:16:44] my hand and said lord let that gentle
[1:16:47] sweet kind humble spirit
[1:16:51] until it comes in and changes me
[1:16:55] then that'll be a paradox in itself
[1:16:58] to take the very nature of a boy that's
[1:17:00] bred between father and mother and yet
[1:17:03] in his intellectuals he's trying his
[1:17:06] best to overcome it he can't do it he'll
[1:17:09] never overcome it christ
[1:17:12] will have to overcome it
[1:17:14] when he let collects christ in then he's
[1:17:17] already overcome then
[1:17:18] it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is
[1:17:21] born
[1:17:23] of the spirit of god i wonder if you
[1:17:24] could bow your heads we're out of time
[1:17:26] by your heads with me every head bowed
[1:17:28] ever i closed
[1:17:47] every one of those channels
[1:17:50] brother adam says it's got to be cleaned
[1:17:52] just like an old boiler
[1:17:54] with the flu stopped up you put a fire
[1:17:56] and it'll blow up
[1:17:58] that's what's matter with so many blown
[1:18:00] up christians they don't clean the
[1:18:02] channels
[1:18:03] they don't go down to the inside you've
[1:18:05] got to clean conscience
[1:18:07] memory thoughts
[1:18:09] laying aside everything
[1:18:11] and coming from the inside out with that
[1:18:14] unadulterated word of god
[1:18:16] see
[1:18:17] it's your mind that opens up the door
[1:18:19] closes the door and listens to your
[1:18:22] conscience to your memory your
[1:18:23] affections but when your mind closes
[1:18:26] itself to these things and lets god the
[1:18:28] spirit of his word come in
[1:18:30] it blows the rest of the stuff out
[1:18:33] how many want to say lord i want you to
[1:18:35] come in
[1:18:36] and blow everything out
[1:18:38] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[1:18:41] every sensation of doubt is gone there's
[1:18:44] nothing standing there but the word of
[1:18:46] god and satan can't battle against that
[1:18:49] he says no sir he can't there's the
[1:18:51] battle
[1:18:52] there's the battle there's the front
[1:18:54] there's the fl the front line
[1:18:56] let's not use some 22 rifle let's get an
[1:18:59] atomic bomb let's do the job right what
[1:19:02] is it brother branham faith in his word
[1:19:05] that's god's atomic bomb
[1:19:07] it blows sickness and devils right and
[1:19:09] left it annihilates them it destroys and
[1:19:12] disintegrates everything that's ungodly
[1:19:15] when that bomb of faith drops in there
[1:19:17] with the word of god behind it it blows
[1:19:19] out every devil every sickness every
[1:19:22] disease
[1:19:24] how many want to say lord
[1:19:26] that's what i need here tonight
[1:19:28] every head belt ever had closed
[1:19:31] say lord i want you to come in
[1:19:34] and do a surgery on me i may not even be
[1:19:37] able to tell me
[1:19:38] what's wrong with me why am i made that
[1:19:41] way why do i a certain way and something
[1:19:43] maybe a certain something bothers me i
[1:19:46] may not be able to do it lord i may be
[1:19:48] able not to go down memory lane and
[1:19:50] that's not what even what you're asking
[1:19:51] me to do here tonight lord all you're
[1:19:53] asking us to do is to open every channel
[1:19:56] open every door give him the key of
[1:19:59] every room and say lord would you come
[1:20:02] great healer and would you come and heal
[1:20:04] every part
[1:20:05] every spot
[1:20:07] every place i just give it all hands up
[1:20:10] hands raised over the building i wonder
[1:20:12] if you could raise those hands and stand
[1:20:14] to your feet raise those hands
[1:20:16] and say lord i want to surrender it to
[1:20:18] you right now

[1:20:57] emotion or some kind of great explosion

[1:22:08] want to walk in your footsteps
[1:22:11] i want to live like you i want your
[1:22:14] spirit to be projected through me in my
[1:22:16] attitude
[1:22:17] in the way that i i present you in the

[1:22:22] wife to my husband lord you're concerned
[1:22:25] you you care about that lord
[1:22:28] and i want to say lord let my nature not
[1:22:30] reflect be a reflection of my complexes
[1:22:32] or my past or my family the atmospheres
[1:22:35] of yesterday but let me project a new
[1:22:39] create a new nature that you've placed
[1:22:41] inside of me so that the imprint i leave
[1:22:44] on those around me is an imprint of
[1:22:46] christ where there's humility and
[1:22:48] there's love and there's meekness and
[1:22:50] there lord there's a love that reaches
[1:22:52] out beyond conditions
[1:22:54] there's a love that reaches on beyond
[1:22:56] sir reaches out past circumstances
[1:22:59] only lord a true love that comes from
[1:23:01] christ can look beyond conditions of
[1:23:04] others
[1:23:05] and still have a true love inside of
[1:23:07] their heart for his soul
[1:23:10] as your prophet said lord
[1:23:12] that your body's not worth even just
[1:23:14] just 50 cents
[1:23:17] all of it put it all togethers not worth
[1:23:20] much you put so much on it we put
[1:23:22] it takes so much time to spend so much
[1:23:25] time to better ourselves and brother
[1:23:26] branham's lord your prophet said he's
[1:23:28] not even why are you your body's not
[1:23:30] even worth 50 cents
[1:23:33] but you've got a soul inside of there
[1:23:35] that scores 10 000 worlds
[1:23:41] you got a soul in there that the devil
[1:23:43] wants
[1:23:45] you got an
[1:23:46] enemy an enemy who does everything he
[1:23:49] can and uses any avenue any channel he
[1:23:51] can
[1:23:53] to try to disrupt and try to hinder
[1:23:56] he's out to destroy and hinder homes
[1:23:58] he's out to wreck and bring carnage to
[1:24:01] marriages and relationships between
[1:24:03] mothers and fathers and daughters and
[1:24:05] sons
[1:24:06] the bible says he's a he's a thief he
[1:24:09] comes to steal kill and destroy
[1:24:11] but i've come you said they might have
[1:24:14] life so lord i pray that you would
[1:24:17] rebuke the enemy tonight in our life
[1:24:20] i want to say satan i'm not going to
[1:24:22] allow you to steal anything from me
[1:24:25] anything you've taken i'm here to claim
[1:24:27] it in the name of the lord jesus i take
[1:24:30] back every part of me that i might have
[1:24:31] lost in a complex i might have lost it
[1:24:34] in some battle that i lost but tonight
[1:24:37] i'd say you might have taken it for
[1:24:38] years but i claim it in the name of the
[1:24:40] lord
[1:24:41] that i'm going to take it back for my
[1:24:43] family you might have tried to make me
[1:24:45] bitter but tonight i've got victory over
[1:24:47] bitterness
[1:24:48] might have tried to make me jealous but
[1:24:50] i've got i've got victory over jealousy
[1:24:53] i've got victory over hatred i've got
[1:24:56] victory over anger
[1:24:58] because there's been a new nature down
[1:25:00] inside and it's not mine
[1:25:04] it's not my people anymore
[1:25:07] it's my christ that
[1:25:10] granted to your lives
[1:25:13] bring healing lord god
[1:25:15] to your children may ask may we lord i
[1:25:18] just say lord as i close now
[1:25:20] change my heart oh god
[1:25:22] change every part of me
[1:25:25] lord i pray that you would take what i
[1:25:27] can't
[1:25:28] as their prophet said about the boys
[1:25:29] trying his best to overcome it
[1:25:32] lord you see that we try our best
[1:25:33] intellectually lord but would you come
[1:25:35] and do a work on our heart that we can't
[1:25:37] do
[1:25:41] all you ask from us is to surrender
[1:25:45] to open up
[1:25:47] open up our hearts
