[0:00] Proverbs 26, start with verse 20. I'd
[0:03] like to read to the end of the chapter,
[0:04] verse 28.
[0:07] Where no wood is, there the fire goeth
[0:10] out. So where there is no tail bearer,
[0:12] the strife see ceaseth. What a amazing
[0:15] statement. As coals are to the burning
[0:17] coals and wood to fire, so is a
[0:19] contentious man to kindle strife. The
[0:22] words of a tail bearer are his wounds,
[0:23] and they go down in the innermost parts
[0:25] of the belly. Burning lips and a wicked
[0:28] heart are like a posturard covered with
[0:30] silver draws. He that hateth assembbleth
[0:32] with his lips, and layeth up deceit
[0:34] within him. When he speaketh fair,
[0:36] believe him not, for there are seven
[0:37] abominations in his heart, whose hatred
[0:39] is covered by deceit. His wickedness
[0:41] shall be showed before the whole
[0:43] congregation. Who so digth a pit shall
[0:45] fall therein, and he that rolleth a
[0:47] stone, it'll return upon him. A lying
[0:49] tongue hateth those that are afflicted
[0:51] by it, and a flattering mouth workketh
[0:54] ruin. by what uh incredible words that
[0:57] we've read. Trust that in this there's
[0:59] something that speaks to you. You can
[1:01] take your seats.
[1:04] We ministered on Sunday on unwaxed and
[1:07] we looked at uh we're looking at pottery
[1:09] and ceramics as an example just to dig
[1:11] into these certain principles in the
[1:12] word of God. Tonight I'm going to use a
[1:14] phrase unglazed. I say phrase, it's just
[1:16] a term. It's a word unglazed. So there's
[1:19] a lot we'd like to express in this.
[1:21] trust we can just jump into it this
[1:22] evening and uh knowing that the chill
[1:25] that we feel is not from air
[1:26] conditioners but from the cooling of the
[1:29] weather here in the valley but unglazed
[1:31] is my title uh to kind of capture some
[1:34] things from Sunday as we had to leave a
[1:35] few things out we'll just review for a
[1:37] few moments Isaiah chapter 64:8
[1:40] says but now oh Lord thou art our father
[1:44] and in this idea of him him being the
[1:47] progenitor him being the creator it says
[1:49] we are the clay and thou art, our
[1:51] potter, and we all are the work of thy
[1:54] hand. So God likens himself in other
[1:56] places as being a potter and Israel
[1:59] being the clay. Here we make this
[2:01] confession. We are but clay in the hands
[2:04] of the master who can make of us as he
[2:06] will, who can form us and fashion us in
[2:08] whatever shape he would desire us to be
[2:10] in. And God is not an artist who's just
[2:13] merely making something to display his
[2:15] handiwork, but he wants it to be used
[2:18] and utilized. And so God is the potter.
[2:21] We are the clay and we are the work of
[2:23] his hand. A potter is an artist who
[2:25] works with ceramics or makes objects out
[2:28] of clay. And God is likening himself to
[2:31] that. He uses the example himself in the
[2:34] scripture. We read some of those on
[2:35] Sunday. And that's is this is how he's
[2:37] describing his work in us as we are but
[2:40] clay that can be formed by him. And we
[2:43] know according to the scripture that God
[2:45] has fashioned us and formed us so that
[2:47] he can dwell inside of us. You are the
[2:49] temple of the Lord. So God forms the
[2:51] clay that you might be the dwelling
[2:54] place of God's spirit. That's the
[2:56] building up of the stature of a perfect
[2:58] man. And it was in this vein that we
[3:00] were using this example of being unwaxed
[3:03] and it was touching on the subject of
[3:05] sincerity. So in Philippians 1:es 9 to1
[3:09] 11 it says in this I pray that your love
[3:12] may abound yet more and more in all in
[3:15] knowledge and in all judgment. So this
[3:18] is the growth. This is the growing the
[3:19] waxing that ye may approve things that
[3:22] are excellent. So we have to be the
[3:24] light which reproves that which judges
[3:27] that ye may be sincere and without
[3:30] offense till the day of Christ. So if we
[3:32] are likened unto vessels that are
[3:34] sincere and without offense, now the
[3:36] vessel is filled. Verse 11, being filled
[3:38] with the fruits of righteousness which
[3:40] are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and
[3:43] praise of God. This is according to even
[3:46] this chapter. This is the work that he's
[3:47] begun in us that he's just and faithful
[3:49] to finish. He's just and faithful to
[3:51] accomplish and to perfect this work. And
[3:54] he says that ye may be inwardly sincere.
[3:56] The sincerity has to do with the depths
[3:58] of heart. inwardly sincere and outwardly
[4:02] without offense or unoffensive. That's
[4:04] that we use the phrase unwaxed and
[4:06] smooth. Unoffensive means smooth. And so
[4:09] in the sense that you are going to be a
[4:11] vessel, you're not waxed and patched up
[4:12] and there's no superficial veneer that
[4:15] is placed upon you. And so being
[4:17] unwaxed, but being a chosen vessel made
[4:19] by God, you can be filled up. You can be
[4:22] uh uh filled with the fruits of
[4:24] righteousness.
[4:25] 1 Corinthians 5 7 and 8. Purge out
[4:29] therefore the old leavenven that you may
[4:31] be a new lump as ye are unleavened. For
[4:33] even Christ our Passover is sacrificed
[4:36] for us. So unleavened, unwaxed,
[4:38] unglazed, all these undoings in our
[4:41] lives. Therefore, let us keep the feast
[4:43] not with old leaven, neither with the
[4:45] leavenven of malice and wickedness, but
[4:46] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[4:48] and truth. This leaven of malice and
[4:51] wickedness speaks to inward insincerity,
[4:54] outward offensiveness. Says, "But we
[4:56] ought to keep the feast with the bread
[4:58] of sincerity and truth. We must be
[5:02] sincere, but we must be sincere with
[5:05] truth." Because if you're sincere and
[5:07] you don't have truth, you are sincerely
[5:09] wrong. And if you just have truth
[5:11] without sincerity, you can handle the
[5:13] truth in righteousness. You can have the
[5:14] wrong motive and objective. So it must
[5:16] be the spirit and truth. It must be
[5:18] sincere with truth. One of the
[5:21] statements that we didn't have time to
[5:23] read on Sunday was from the sermon
[5:24] trying to do God a service without it
[5:26] being his will at the businessman's
[5:29] breakfast in November of 1965. He says,
[5:31] "You can think you're doing God a
[5:33] service. And if you're going out of
[5:35] God's way of doing it, you're going to
[5:37] keep messing it up on and on. So you may
[5:40] believe that you're doing God a service,
[5:42] but if it's not according to his will,
[5:44] you're just going to keep messing it up
[5:45] because you've got to do it his way. Oh
[5:48] church of the living God, please forgive
[5:50] my Irish way and my sense of humor, but
[5:52] in the sincerity and sacredness of my
[5:54] heart, you assemblies of God, you
[5:56] oneness, Presbyterian, Methodist,
[5:58] whatever you are, flee for your life.
[6:01] Remember, get out from there. Now, that
[6:03] don't mean draw out from church. That
[6:06] means draw out from denominationalism.
[6:08] So there's a there's a way then that we
[6:10] look at this. He says you got to leave
[6:11] denominations but don't leave church.
[6:12] Sometimes people have taken it too far
[6:14] to leave church. He says you must go to
[6:16] church but don't don't join any
[6:18] organization. Jesus went with all the
[6:20] organizations but he never joined one of
[6:22] them. Neither did he side with any of
[6:24] them. No indeed but he was among them.
[6:27] There's where the lights got to be
[6:28] scattered. A lot of what we've been
[6:30] looking at and reflecting his beauty and
[6:32] these different sermons we've preached
[6:34] over the last few weeks have been about
[6:35] light and you being light and this
[6:37] brightness of his beauty, this radiance
[6:39] without these filters, these glasses
[6:41] that warp the light. He says this is
[6:43] where the light's got to be scattered
[6:44] and you stay right where you are
[6:46] scattering the light. That's what God's
[6:48] using you for.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; So you are to be a vessel of light.
[6:53] Right?
[6:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Hungry-hearted people, let
[6:55] them know that Jesus Christ is real,
[6:57] just the same as he was yesterday, he is
[6:59] today and will be forever." He says, "It
[7:02] is possible a man or woman with all
[7:04] sincerity trying their best to do God a
[7:06] service and stirred it in the wrong
[7:09] way." So, here's the possibility that
[7:11] one could be just as sincere as they
[7:14] possibly can be and they're trying to do
[7:16] right, but they're stirred in the wrong
[7:18] way. He says with the genuine anointing
[7:19] of the Holy Spirit upon them, but
[7:21] stirred it contrary to God's plan for
[7:23] the age and chaos the whole thing.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Chaos the whole thing by not coming
[7:30] God's provided way to do it. And I think
[7:32] we can see this example today. A lot of
[7:34] sincere people are stirred a and trying
[7:37] to do God a a service and they're
[7:39] sincere about it, but it's not according
[7:41] to God's way of doing. He says
[7:43] particularly the plan for this age and
[7:45] what does it cause? a lot of confusion,
[7:46] a lot of chaos and a and a lot of
[7:49] diffusion of the light.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; So, he's saying that we must be sincere,
[7:53] but it's not just sincerity alone. I was
[7:55] wanting to read that Sunday just to back
[7:57] up those many different statements we
[7:58] were looking at that we must be it to be
[8:01] sincere or unwaxed as we were saying is
[8:03] that it must also be to truth. Sincerity
[8:06] and truth. That's how you have genuine
[8:08] faith. A sincere faith is when it's
[8:11] rooted in the word of God. Now, on the
[8:14] subject this evening on unglazed, I'm
[8:16] wanting to pick up on a lot of these
[8:17] similar themes of light and pottery and
[8:19] these different arts that we can look at
[8:21] to draw from them truth to make them
[8:23] more easily grasped for us as
[8:24] Christians. And I'm using it as a
[8:27] reference to pottery to say unglazed.
[8:30] I'm using it as a reference to pottery
[8:31] that has not been glazed. And the
[8:34] definition of glaze is to fit with
[8:36] glass. I want you to think of this
[8:38] phrase. It's important to fit with glass
[8:40] or to make shine. So when something is
[8:43] glazed, it's fitted with glass and this
[8:45] is very uh literal in our modern
[8:47] techniques with glazing and uh it is
[8:49] also makes it's made to shine to make
[8:53] shine. Now some of you folks may know
[8:56] that the phrase glaze is now uh is used
[8:59] to speak of uh over complimenting
[9:01] something. That's exaggerated or
[9:04] excessive praise where somebody is just
[9:06] passing on the old glorious Caleb
[9:08] Williams and there you say well they're
[9:09] this glazing on Caleb Williams. he's the
[9:11] greatest quarterback ever to walk the
[9:13] grid iron. And so you say, "Well, that's
[9:15] just glazing because you say, well,
[9:16] clearly he's not the greatest
[9:17] quarterback ever. He may have the
[9:20] greatest uh nails painted in in
[9:22] quarterback history. I don't know." But
[9:25] there's that's just when somebody the oh
[9:27] this guy's this and it's over excessive
[9:29] and it's a little bit too much. They
[9:30] call that glazing. Why? Because it's
[9:32] more than it should be.
[9:35] And now in the sense of pottery, potters
[9:38] use glaze to cover vessels with a shiny
[9:40] or glossy substance. Uh we might say to
[9:43] gloss over something or to glaze over.
[9:45] It's to cover something up with uh some
[9:47] substance that makes it shine, makes it
[9:49] pop. And it's done to improve the
[9:52] appearance of the clay. It's done to
[9:54] make it look attractive. It's cosmetic.
[9:56] It's artistic.
[9:58] And there's even we could say glaze
[10:00] over. But then there's also a phrase
[10:01] you've probably heard of before and it's
[10:03] to gloss over. Anybody ever heard that
[10:05] phrase? We're not talking about lips,
[10:06] but we're talking about glossing over
[10:08] something. But it means to minimize
[10:09] something or to omit something. Oh, I
[10:11] glossed over that. I glazed over that.
[10:13] And it's to apply. If you gloss over
[10:16] something, you're applying a varnish to
[10:17] make something appear smooth.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; May not be smooth, but you want it to
[10:21] look like it's smooth.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; And so it's to make something attractive
[10:25] or acceptable by deception. That's what
[10:27] maybe glossing over something. you give
[10:29] it this superficial treatment. It's
[10:31] like, wow, man. We were having a
[10:32] conversation about this. They kind of
[10:33] glossed over the fact uh that they that
[10:36] they're a convicted felon and and and
[10:38] want to buy a gun. You say, "Well, that
[10:39] that was very important." And they just
[10:41] kind of gloss over it. So, it's the idea
[10:43] of obscuring or concealing or
[10:45] diminishing the importance of something
[10:47] to glaze over it, to gloss over it. You
[10:49] trying to hide it, trying to cover up or
[10:50] diminish its importance. Now, we can
[10:53] gloss over an error. Glaze over an
[10:56] error. Something can be a lie. You kind
[10:57] of glaze over it. you minimize how
[10:59] important it is. You kind of disregard
[11:01] the fact that it's a lie. But you can
[11:02] also glaze over the truth
[11:05] &gt;&gt; in the sense that you try to cover it up
[11:06] and you make it something it's not or
[11:08] omit it. And so when we use the phrase
[11:11] at this point I want to look at from the
[11:13] standpoint unglazed is to not be
[11:15] artificially smooth. the hypocrisy we
[11:17] were looking at on Sunday, but to be
[11:19] sincere and and not covering it up with
[11:22] religion, with our attempts to appear
[11:24] righteous or or our attempts to make
[11:26] ourselves acceptable to God or if we
[11:30] could use it in the sense of to make
[11:31] shine or to fit with glass. It's we
[11:33] don't want to use a false light.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just use smoke and
[11:37] mirrors. We don't want to try to put off
[11:38] errors and use a false light. And this
[11:41] is I think we're hopefully when we we
[11:43] hitting this and turning to Acts chapter
[11:45] 23:3, I want to make this point with the
[11:48] these scriptures we have coming up that
[11:50] sin at its worst is glazed to appear
[11:53] beautiful and obtractive.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; We may say sin at its worst is when you
[11:57] look at it and SAY THAT'S HORRIBLE,
[11:58] THAT'S AWFUL, THAT'S DEBAUCHERY, THAT'S
[12:00] PERVERSION, that's filth, that's
[12:02] disgusting. But no, sin at its worst is
[12:05] when it's glazed to appear beautiful,
[12:07] &gt;&gt; when it's made smooth, when it's made
[12:09] attractive, when it when that happens,
[12:11] sin is is are the it's the attributes of
[12:15] unbelief and it's made to it kind of
[12:17] glosses over the misery of it,
[12:20] &gt;&gt; glosses over the death that lays inside
[12:22] of it. in Acts chapter 23:3. And for
[12:25] time's sake, we're just not going to
[12:26] build around this story where Paul gets
[12:29] pretty upset because he's struck in the
[12:31] face. And then said Paul unto him, God
[12:33] shall smite thee, thou whited wall. He's
[12:36] not talking about tires. Thou whited
[12:39] wall forsidest thou to judge me after
[12:42] the law, and commandest me to be smitten
[12:45] contrary to the law. What was he calling
[12:48] him out for? Being a hypocrite. And he
[12:51] calls them a wided wall. I don't know if
[12:53] you've ever heard anybody call somebody
[12:55] a wided wall as a way of criticizing
[12:57] them or calling them out, but he says
[12:58] they're a wided wall. Wided wall means
[13:00] to cover over. To be wided means to
[13:02] cover over with lime. To plaster over
[13:05] means to whitewash.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; And what happens when you whitewash
[13:08] something? You're covering it with in a
[13:10] way to wash it to appear clean. But
[13:13] you've only covered it up. It's not
[13:15] actually scrubbed clean or or or
[13:17] whittleled down to its its base basis
[13:20] and and rendered pure, but it's JUST
[13:22] KIND OF PLASTERED OVER. It's been given
[13:25] something to cover up. It says YOU'RE A
[13:26] WIDED WALL. YOU'RE BEING HYPOCRITICAL.
[13:29] You want to appear righteous and pious.
[13:31] You want to appear to have some sort of
[13:32] authority and and judge me according to
[13:35] the law, but then you act contrary to
[13:37] the law. So the term whited wall and he
[13:41] especially to a Jew is one who is a
[13:43] hypocrite.
[13:44] A wided wall is one who conceals malice
[13:47] under this outward uh uh uh piety, this
[13:50] outward religion.
[13:52] That's exactly what's happening in Acts
[13:54] 23. Jesus says it in chapter 23 of
[13:57] Matthew verse 27. Woe unto you scribes
[13:59] and Pharisees hypocrites. For ye are
[14:02] like unto whited supplicers,
[14:05] whitewashed, plastered over, rendered
[14:08] brilliant, identifiable, you could see
[14:10] it, which indeed appear beautiful
[14:12] outward. And notice I think this is just
[14:15] a beautiful picture of what is meant
[14:17] behind this wided wall and what is kind
[14:20] of being addressed in terms of these
[14:21] things that are very very superficial.
[14:23] You appear beautiful outwardly
[14:26] but are within full of dead men's bones
[14:28] and all uncleanness. Now this is a very
[14:30] real uh example within the law. What the
[14:33] Jews would do is they would whitewash
[14:35] the tombs so that they were identifiable
[14:38] so that you could see them because to
[14:39] touch them could RENDER SOMEBODY DEFILED
[14:42] AND THEY wouldn't be able to perform
[14:43] service or enter to the temple. There
[14:44] was this washing that they would have to
[14:46] go through. So they wanted to make it
[14:48] obvious to stay away.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; So this is a concept that would have
[14:52] been very useful. Whitewash it, paint it
[14:53] white, plaster it, put the lime wash
[14:56] over it. What make it conspicuous so
[14:58] that when someone sees it, they would
[14:59] avoid it. But he's saying you have
[15:00] become yourselves whitewashed to be
[15:03] appear beautiful but inside
[15:06] &gt;&gt; you're full of death.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand makes a number of
[15:10] statements on this order many many
[15:12] different places in the message where
[15:13] he's talking about this this light the
[15:16] false light this glamour that can be
[15:18] expressed. He says sin is so enticing.
[15:22] He says it is glamour and it's got a
[15:24] very appetizing appeal. It is so
[15:27] innocent.
[15:29] And we may think, "Wow, man. I tell you
[15:30] what, a prostitution doesn't seem very
[15:32] appealing, and drug addictions don't
[15:34] seem appealing, and you know, smoking
[15:36] crack isn't appealing, and doing heroin
[15:38] isn't appealing, and robbing somebody,
[15:39] and killing somebody. There's a lot of
[15:41] things we might say is not very
[15:42] appealing." But those are the things
[15:44] that h have haven't been glazed over.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Those are the things that kind of we
[15:50] haven't whitewashed.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; We read in Proverbs 26 23, we're talking
[15:56] about a slothful man in these verses.
[15:58] and then one that begins to lie and to
[16:00] meddle and just how the tongue is such
[16:02] an unruly member which can kindleth a
[16:05] small matter and make it great. A lot of
[16:07] great scriptural principles being
[16:08] addressed. But he begins to talk about
[16:10] one who lies with his mouth, speaks
[16:12] fair, but he has abominations in his
[16:14] heart. He stirth uh hatred with his lips
[16:17] uh and he does it with deceit. It says
[16:20] burning lips and a wicked heart are like
[16:22] a postured covered with silver draws. I
[16:24] almost named my sermon today flaming
[16:27] lips.
[16:28] Burning lips and a wicked heart are like
[16:30] a posturard covered with silver draws.
[16:32] Postured here is pottery which is broken
[16:36] might often be appear as if it's
[16:38] something that is a fragment of pottery
[16:41] but what is to me when I studied this
[16:43] and looked at it it's not so much just a
[16:45] fragment or a piece but pottery which is
[16:47] otherwise unusable that is covered with
[16:50] silver dross. You know what that is? a
[16:52] glaze.
[16:55] It's something that's broken, covered up
[16:58] with a glaze so that you don't see its
[17:00] cracks.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; It's a dishonest use of glaze.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; We said that potters use glaze to cover
[17:07] vessels in in a glossy substance to make
[17:09] it appear beautiful and cosmetically
[17:12] appealing. But now this is the use of it
[17:14] not just to catch the eye, but to
[17:16] actually cover some deformity.
[17:18] And it's saying that burning lips and a
[17:21] wicked heart is like a broken pottery
[17:25] vessel that's been glazed over with
[17:27] silver dross or glazed so that you don't
[17:30] see the cracks. This is a fervent
[17:33] speech. Burning lips is a fervent
[17:35] speech. Passionate speech. Oh, I love
[17:40] you. Oh, isn't that wonderful? ISN'T
[17:42] THAT GREAT? I believe this. I BELIEVE
[17:44] THAT. SOME KIND OF CONFESSION. THEY DRAW
[17:46] NIGH WITH me to their lips, but their
[17:47] hearts are far from me. It's fervent
[17:49] speech which deceptively covers
[17:52] dishonesty or evil in their heart.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; And now the scriptur is likening to
[17:56] somebody who isn't sincere in the depths
[17:58] of their heart but maybe outwardly
[18:00] pious. He's saying you're like a clay
[18:02] vessel that is actually broken
[18:05] &gt;&gt; and inside is death but we dress it up
[18:09] &gt;&gt; with lies. We dress it up with our mouth
[18:13] with a glaze.
[18:15] This may seem to be lowhanging fruit, no
[18:18] pun intended, but in Genesis chapter 3,
[18:22] when you read the temptation of the
[18:24] woman by by Satan through the serpent,
[18:27] the woman says, "You will if you partake
[18:30] of this fruit, you will die."
[18:33] And Satan begins to
[18:35] lie. Says, "You surely shall not die.
[18:37] You surely shall surely not die. For God
[18:40] knows the day that you eat thereof."
[18:41] This is verses 4 to6. Then your eyes
[18:44] shall be open and you shall be as gods.
[18:46] What's he doing? We know the result is
[18:49] death.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; But what is he doing now? He's glazing
[18:52] death over.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; He's actually glazing it over with a
[18:56] lie. And he can't say, "Well, you're not
[18:58] going to die immediately. It'll take
[19:00] some time."
[19:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, you'll become his gods.
[19:03] You'll know good and evil." And when
[19:06] Wilman saw that the tree was good for
[19:08] food and that it was pleasant to the
[19:09] eyes, and a tree desired to make one
[19:12] wise, what happened? Eve started glazing
[19:16] over the food.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; IT WAS TO EAT IT, YOU DIE. BUT NOW SHE'S
[19:20] GIVING THIS unsubstantiated praise to
[19:22] it. Oh my, isn't this good? And that's
[19:24] exactly what she did. She went to Adam
[19:26] and was glazing over the forbidden fruit
[19:28] so much. Adam ptook himself. AND SO WHAT
[19:30] HAPPENED is Satan in the beginning, the
[19:32] original sin is about taking a lie and
[19:34] dressing it up.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; He caused Eve to desire this forbidden
[19:41] fruit. This is this is at the very root
[19:44] of how Satan works. If you eat it, you
[19:47] die. Oh no, let's just gloss over it.
[19:50] Let's glaze over it a little bit. And
[19:52] brother Bradam talks about how human
[19:54] instinctively and spiritually, he talks
[19:57] about how that we're uh we we we we go
[19:59] for what glitters.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe in our modern language, we would
[20:02] say that we're wired for glitter.
[20:05] But he uses this phrase a few times, but
[20:07] not all that glitters is gold.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; That's a common expression, a common
[20:10] phrase. Not all that glitters is gold.
[20:12] He talks about how that he's uh been a
[20:14] little bit of a prospector. He's seen
[20:16] fool's gold that shines brighter than
[20:18] real gold. That's right.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; And so there's something that can
[20:21] appear, as he said, very innocent, very
[20:23] pleasing, very attractive, have an
[20:26] appetizing appeal to sin, but that sin
[20:29] as it's glazed.
[20:32] Listen, how many how many kids here just
[20:34] order a plain cake donut? Huh? How how
[20:37] many of you do it? Be honest. No, you
[20:40] don't want you just don't want a a a
[20:41] donut. You want it glazed, right? True.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; You you you wanted to have some that's
[20:47] the attraction. An unglazed cake donut.
[20:50] That's a waste of time.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; It's a happy meal without a toy and a
[20:54] fruit cup instead of fries.
[20:57] And so this is we're kind of wired that
[20:59] way. We it wants to be attractive. We
[21:01] want to be pleasing.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said that's WHAT'S
[21:04] THE MATTER WITH our world today is too
[21:06] much sin is called innocent fun.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's a lot of things
[21:12] that we have patched up and covered over
[21:14] the consequences.
[21:16] We've rephrased things in a way and
[21:18] we've looked at consequences and we've
[21:20] kind of shuffled things around and we
[21:21] begin to glaze over the tombs and begin
[21:24] to glaze over the death. We begin to
[21:26] glaze over the consequences so much to
[21:28] where now we begin to make sin look
[21:30] appealing just as Satan was able to do
[21:32] it in Genesis 3.
[21:36] In Hebrews 11 24- 27
[21:40] says by faith Moses when he was come to
[21:43] years refused to be called the son of
[21:45] Pharaoh's daughter. It may not seem to
[21:48] be uh much. We say well he wasn't the
[21:50] son of Pharaoh's daughter. But he said I
[21:52] I don't want to be identified with it. I
[21:54] don't want the benefits and the
[21:55] privileges that come with it. I don't
[21:56] want the path to the throne that I may
[21:58] get because of this. But by faith when
[22:01] he was come of years he refused to be
[22:03] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[22:04] And he chose he refused and chose or
[22:07] refused and choosed verse 25 choosing
[22:10] rather to suffer affliction with the
[22:13] people of God than to enjoy the
[22:15] pleasures of sin for a season. Brother
[22:18] Bam talking about Lot. He says Lot when
[22:20] he looked down in those wellwatered
[22:21] plains he saw the sins of Sodom and he
[22:23] looked at was like oh well YOU KNOW I
[22:25] COULD STILL KEEP my testimony. Oh this
[22:27] won't matter. He says how easy it is and
[22:29] how pleasing sin looks to be and how
[22:31] innocent it looks to be.
[22:33] way to paint the picture to where it's
[22:35] not as bad as it looks.
[22:38] But here, Moses chooses affliction
[22:42] over pleasure.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; I love the way that it's expressed here.
[22:46] He doesn't say he ch he chose the riches
[22:48] of Christ. He chose affliction over
[22:51] pleasure, esteeming the reproach of
[22:54] Christ. Again, it's not riches again.
[22:56] It's the reproach greater riches than
[22:58] the treasures in Egypt. Amen.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; So he chose affliction over pleasures
[23:03] and reproach over treasures.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; For he had respect under the recompense
[23:08] of the reward. By faith he forsook
[23:10] Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the
[23:11] king. For he endured as seeing him who
[23:14] is invisible.
[23:16] If I could put it this way, Moses was
[23:18] able to look beyond the reproach of
[23:21] Christ, able to look beyond the
[23:23] affliction of God's people and see the
[23:25] greater beauty in it.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Right? He must have seen in Israel what
[23:30] God saw a vessel of honor. He must have
[23:33] seen in Christ what God saw something
[23:36] worthy to be chosen. And when he was
[23:39] able to look at it that way, say, "Well,
[23:41] I have I have reproach and I have
[23:43] suffering and I have treasures and
[23:44] pleasures and I'm going to choose this."
[23:46] IT'S BECAUSE HE SAW A GREATER VALUE AND
[23:49] WORTH ON THE OTHER SIDE of that.
[23:52] PASS ALL THE DIFFICULTIES, PASS ALL THE
[23:54] SUFFERING, then all the the temporary
[23:56] pleasures
[23:58] &gt;&gt; that sin would offer him.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; It actually allowed him to unglaze sin.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; The pleasures of sin for a season. Sin
[24:05] for is is pleasant for a while, right?
[24:08] Kind of like what's going to happen this
[24:10] coming, not this, not tomorrow, but next
[24:12] week. It's going TO BE A LIFETIME on the
[24:14] lips and months on the hips if we're
[24:16] lucky. or maybe a life a moment on the
[24:19] lips and a lifetime on the hips is what
[24:21] they say. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S JUST FOR A
[24:23] MOMENT. FOR A moment when they say it's
[24:26] it's it's sweet in your mouth. What's
[24:27] the scripture say? It's sweet in my
[24:28] mouth but bigger in my belly.
[24:31] It's my translation.
[24:34] And so there's something about this
[24:36] temporary enjoyment that comes with
[24:38] permanent consequences. He says, "You
[24:39] know what? I've taken all the varnish
[24:42] off his sin. It's
[24:43] &gt;&gt; been unglazed before my eyes. And so I
[24:46] I'm willing to choose Christ.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; You ever heard the phrase, I think it's
[24:50] even made into a song, it's easier to
[24:52] sell a lie than to give the truth away.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just the reality anymore.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; It's easier to sell a lie, to make truth
[25:03] off a lie, make money off a lie, than it
[25:05] is to give the truth away.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:09] And I think it's because truth in
[25:11] reality,
[25:13] people, it's hard to see the beauty in
[25:15] it.
[25:17] But if I could encourage you this way,
[25:19] truth doesn't need to be dressed up.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; I think that's where we we we wrestle a
[25:25] lot of times and say, "Well, how can we
[25:26] dress it up?
[25:28] How how can we, you know, how how can we
[25:30] try to clean up the message so it so it
[25:32] it doesn't look so controversial?" Well,
[25:34] I'm not going to try that
[25:37] &gt;&gt; because when they do that with the
[25:38] Bible, they get so far away from God.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; And so I I I'm not responsible for
[25:43] trying to clean things up.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Clean the record up. Explain this.
[25:46] Explain that. I I I I don't want to do
[25:49] that. What I want for myself personally
[25:51] is to know that I'm walking by faith.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; That that's what means the most to me.
[25:55] That's how I'm able to to receive from
[25:57] God. It's how I'm blessed BY HIS
[25:59] PRESENCE. IT'S HOW I OVERCOME difficult
[26:00] situations. IT'S WHAT MADE ME FREE FROM
[26:02] the law of sin or death is the personal
[26:04] REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. NOT CLEANING
[26:06] UP MY PAST, not explaining all my
[26:08] mistakes and figuring everything out and
[26:10] how it all works together for good.
[26:11] Truth does not need to be dressed up.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, in order to see
[26:16] Christ, we have to take all the
[26:18] denominational glaze away.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; All the theological, it has to be
[26:23] unglazed to see the true beauty of
[26:25] Christ. Amen.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; I've been just trying to study and
[26:28] prepare my heart for some of the things
[26:30] that uh maybe even in the Christmas
[26:32] season and just to wrap up the thought
[26:33] we've been on this year. And what I keep
[26:35] coming back to is just how beautiful
[26:38] Christ is.
[26:40] That there there is an image of beauty
[26:42] that we should be beholding that we
[26:44] should be looking at. We should see it
[26:45] in Christ. And he doesn't need makeup.
[26:47] He doesn't need dress up. He doesn't
[26:48] need explanation. We he needs revelation
[26:52] &gt;&gt; to see him as he is
[26:54] &gt;&gt; in his true glory. and glow because
[26:56] that's what Christ does is he radiates,
[26:58] he glows. Whereas Hollywood glitters,
[27:00] humankind is attracted to the glitz.
[27:02] Just human instinct
[27:05] to to want something to glitter.
[27:09] That's why things are advertised with
[27:11] neon signs,
[27:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[27:14] &gt;&gt; With there there's certain colors that
[27:16] pop. There's certain uh you know there's
[27:18] a science behind branding. Why? They
[27:20] want to draw your attention.
[27:24] So, we've looked at for a few moments
[27:28] on this subject of unglazed in the sense
[27:31] of uh something being humanly or even
[27:34] deceptively glossed over.
[27:37] Well, you take something maybe has a
[27:38] flaw or a defect or take something that
[27:40] is actually death, but then you glaze it
[27:42] over with a shiny substance like, "Oo, I
[27:45] want to drink that, but inside is death,
[27:49] &gt;&gt; poison."
[27:51] We looked at it in that sense. But on
[27:52] the other hand, there's actually a
[27:53] practical use for glaze. And and I
[27:56] venture here for all the ceramacist here
[27:59] who might be like, "Well, that's you're
[28:00] giving glaze a bad name." And so, we're
[28:03] going to redeem glaze.
[28:06] But there's a practical use for it.
[28:09] Earth and wear or clay vessels remain
[28:11] slightly porous even after firing.
[28:15] And so if you were to take a vessel and
[28:18] want to store liquids in it, those
[28:19] liquids in that clay container would
[28:21] percolate slowly to the outside or be
[28:23] absorbed into the clay and render the
[28:26] vessel perhaps unusable for anything
[28:28] else or completely ineffective in the
[28:30] sense THAT I PUT WATER IN IT AND now
[28:32] it's all gone. I put I put oil in it but
[28:34] now it's all been absorbed into the
[28:36] clay.
[28:37] So you would glaze that vessel. There
[28:40] would be this application in the very
[28:41] beginning. the techniques. I was reading
[28:43] and studying on these techniques going
[28:44] back hundreds and hundreds, thousands of
[28:46] years. Really just a a fascinating
[28:48] stuff. Anybody want to have a breakout
[28:49] session? Maybe meet for coffee for a few
[28:51] hours. We can talk glazes.
[28:55] And there is so many different
[28:56] techniques and how the Chinese started
[28:58] doing this. And even on these certain
[29:00] islands, they found certain
[29:01] applications. They're all trying to
[29:02] solve this problem. I MADE THIS
[29:04] WONDERFUL VESSEL to hold this liquid,
[29:06] BUT IT REMAINED POROUS AFTER I FIRED IT.
[29:08] AND THEY TRIED TO COME UP WITH A way to
[29:09] seal it so it wouldn't leak out.
[29:12] One of the techniques that seemed to
[29:14] stick and that became the most effective
[29:15] was this application of finely ground
[29:18] glass powder suspended in water. And you
[29:21] you'd apply that to a to a a vessel that
[29:25] had already been fired. I think they
[29:26] call it bisque firing now. Makes me kind
[29:28] of hungry. Lobster bisque, right? And
[29:32] there's a there's a bisque firing that
[29:34] you do and then there's a subsequent
[29:36] glazing and then you fire it at hotter
[29:38] temperatures for longer, I think. And
[29:40] what would HAPPEN WHEN FIRED AGAIN, THAT
[29:42] GLAZE, that glass that was applied would
[29:44] melt and form this fused glass layer.
[29:47] And they say it would seal the clay
[29:49] pores so that whatever was in it
[29:52] wouldn't get out
[29:53] &gt;&gt; and other things couldn't get in. It was
[29:56] sealed.
[29:58] So there's a human glazing
[30:01] there. There is a there's a a veneer.
[30:03] There's something we could try to do to
[30:04] fix something up. But then in another
[30:06] sense, there's a a WAY THAT GOD HAS FOR
[30:09] HIS OWN EARTH AND VESSELS. HE HE HE
[30:11] FORMS YOU AS CLAY. You're coming to this
[30:12] world AS VESSELS OF CLAY. BUT GOD HAS A
[30:15] PROCESS TO BRING YOU TO A PLACE WHERE
[30:17] YOU CAN BE A VESSEL FILLED WITH
[30:18] GOODNESS.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[30:20] &gt;&gt; In religion, THEY HAVE A BROKEN VESSEL
[30:22] THAT THEY TRY TO FIX AND THEY TRY TO USE
[30:24] ALL THESE HUMAN IDEAS TO CREATE
[30:26] RELIGION, BUT something's lacking on the
[30:28] inside. And worse yet, something's still
[30:30] there on the inside that still
[30:32] eventually leaks out.
[30:34] Whereas with God's process, he wants to
[30:36] seal you.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; As Ephesians chapter 4:30 says, "And
[30:40] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[30:41] whereby you are sealed into the day of
[30:43] redemption." The Holy Spirit is part of
[30:45] God's glazing process that SEALS YOU UP.
[30:49] GOD IS THE POTTER WHO forms you. The
[30:52] glazes, fires his own work to seal in
[30:55] the goodness of God
[30:56] &gt;&gt; in the soul to seal that soul up.
[31:01] It's why many people can have
[31:02] experiences with God, but until you're
[31:05] born again by the baptism of the Holy
[31:07] Ghost, your experience can just leak
[31:08] out.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Can keep leaking out. Things can leak
[31:12] in. Things get out eventually if you're
[31:14] just pretending you're going to have a
[31:15] meltdown or a breakdown. If God is
[31:17] gracious to you,
[31:19] &gt;&gt; could any of any of you testify that
[31:22] there was a time in your life when you
[31:23] seemed like you were doing pretty good
[31:25] as a Christian, pretty good as a
[31:26] believer, and then God I think a CS
[31:29] Lewis said it, he said, "God knew that
[31:31] what I had was a house of cards.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; It was I that didn't know it." SO GOD
[31:35] ALLOWS IT TO COME CRASHING DOWN SO YOU
[31:37] CAN GET THE real stuff.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; AND SO IF GOD'S GRACIOUS TO US, he it's
[31:43] exposed. Otherwise, we just continue on
[31:46] as hypocrites.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; So, there is this glazing that can take
[31:52] place.
[31:54] So, you can look at it this way. Say,
[31:55] well, my subject is unglazed. I don't
[31:58] want to be glazed by the world, but I
[31:59] don't want to be left unglazed
[32:01] where God seals in this vessel.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; So, remember these two uh these two
[32:08] definitions we use for glaze to fit with
[32:10] glass. There's this image of this glass,
[32:13] this solidifying. It's actually glassed
[32:15] over. That's what glaze is or to make
[32:17] shine.
[32:19] In second Corinthians chapter 3:18,
[32:21] notice he says, "But we all with open
[32:22] face beholden as in a glass the glory of
[32:25] the Lord or changes the same image from
[32:28] glory to glory, even as by the spirit of
[32:30] the Lord."
[32:32] Jesus Christ who is in the image of God
[32:34] the stature of a perfect man that when
[32:37] we behold and when we look at him we can
[32:39] say there's true beauty he who the
[32:42] father hath sealed and there on Mount
[32:44] Transfiguration his face did shine as
[32:46] the sun there was this glorious radiance
[32:49] he's rendered ILLUSTRIOUS HERE HE'S
[32:51] SHINING HIS GLORY SAYS AND WE ALL
[32:53] BEHOLDING HIM AS IN A GLASS THERE THAT'S
[32:56] THE TRUE GLORY OF God
[32:59] just as there to to glaze SOMETHING'S
[33:01] FIT WITH GLASS. WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING
[33:03] into a mirror to see ourselves a as
[33:06] unfinished and see ourselves as raw
[33:08] human beings, but we're actually looking
[33:09] INTO GOD'S GLORY AND WE SAY, "THIS IS
[33:11] WHAT I CAN BECOME."
[33:16] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 5:16, let your light so shine
[33:19] before men that they may see your good
[33:20] works and glorify your father which is
[33:22] in heaven. Glorify [snorts] there means
[33:23] to render, illustrious, to make, to
[33:26] shine, to radiate. How do they do it? By
[33:28] your light.
[33:30] Your light is the glory of God. In John
[33:32] 17:es 1-6,
[33:35] these words spake Jesus and lifted up
[33:37] his eyes to heaven and said, "Father,
[33:38] the hour has come. Glorify thy son that
[33:41] thy son also may glorify thee. Render me
[33:44] ILLUSTRIOUS THAT I MAY SHINE in your
[33:46] great glory." I'm just using these um
[33:50] using these uh these terms of of
[33:53] pottery. This is God now glory says, "I
[33:55] have glorified IT AND I WILL GLORIFY it
[33:57] again." This is this process of making
[34:00] him to shine
[34:03] &gt;&gt; as thou has given him power over all
[34:04] flesh that he should give eternal life
[34:06] to as many as thou has given him. So now
[34:08] there's this power
[34:10] of giving and this is life eternal that
[34:13] they may know thee the only true God and
[34:15] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent. I have
[34:18] glorified thee on the earth. I finished
[34:19] the work which thou gavest me to do. And
[34:21] now, oh father, glorify thou me with
[34:24] thine own self, with the glory which I
[34:26] had with thee before the world was. This
[34:29] is such a beautiful template for what
[34:31] God wants to do in you. You are the
[34:33] temple of the Holy Ghost. Glorify me
[34:35] with your own self.
[34:37] That this light that shines in this end
[34:39] time isn't shining on you, but it shall
[34:41] be risen in you.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; I have manifested thy name unto the men
[34:47] which thou gavest me out of the world.
[34:48] They thine they were and thou gavest
[34:51] them me and they have kept thy word.
[34:54] Glorify them. He says I have manifested
[34:57] thy name unto them. Name is character.
[35:00] It's its identity. Its presence
[35:04] the light of one's countenance.
[35:06] Beholding that manifestation even for us
[35:08] we say beholding him as in a glass to
[35:11] make to shine. This is what Christ said
[35:13] he's done. Therefore, for us, as we
[35:15] behold God's manifested glory, we're
[35:17] changed. It makes us glorious.
[35:21] Where do we find his glory? It's in his
[35:23] word.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Well, in the printed pages, it's in the
[35:26] revelation of it.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; It's in the fulfilling of it.
[35:31] And
[35:31] &gt;&gt; so I'd like to I'm I'm going to Lord
[35:35] willing and close here in just a few
[35:37] moments.
[35:39] But I want to come back to where we were
[35:41] Sunday when we were looking at that uh
[35:44] vision that brother Brandham had of that
[35:46] the black mamba that snake which
[35:47] represents sin and death as he tells the
[35:50] story in the sermon paradox. Somehow he
[35:52] came through this narrow highway and and
[35:54] as he's traveling he since there was
[35:56] people were you know something was
[35:58] causing fear and everyone was afraid and
[36:00] scared to death and they were afraid of
[36:02] this giant mamba snake that he said was
[36:04] certain death if it struck you instant
[36:07] death if it bites you and he was going
[36:09] after a brother he says in one place and
[36:11] he says that how that it started to come
[36:12] after brother Brandon but then something
[36:13] was holding it off and then it went
[36:16] after a friend
[36:18] and he said just then the serpent turned
[36:21] to me when I said that and looked at me
[36:23] again and the voice came from above and
[36:25] said you've been given power and he says
[36:27] you know stop that don't don't he's kind
[36:30] of responding to this threat to his
[36:31] friend you've been given power to bind
[36:33] him
[36:35] &gt;&gt; the worst or any so [snorts] it's kind
[36:38] of like this the head this is the top
[36:41] and brother Bam's response well what
[36:42] must I do
[36:45] and again I love the humility of brother
[36:46] Bradam to not just um make this
[36:49] assumption oh well and you know I'll
[36:51] just head plug headlong into it. Well,
[36:54] the truth is is I can bind him. But then
[36:55] you have to have this sincerity to it.
[36:57] He goes, "What must I do?" He said,
[36:58] "There's one thing you must do. You must
[37:00] be more sincere. You must be more
[37:02] sincere."
[37:05] Recall just a few moments ago, we talked
[37:06] about how glazing is like this sealing
[37:09] process.
[37:11] It's a process where it's something is
[37:12] sealed in. Something that you desire to
[37:14] be in there, but also if you're going to
[37:15] seal something in, there's this binding
[37:17] of things keeping things out. Keep
[37:19] things in there. keep things out.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And here, brother Bam is told, "You've
[37:23] been given power to bind him."
[37:26] Think of it as it represents sin. Death
[37:29] is the consequence of sin. If sin has
[37:32] been dealt with, there is no consequence
[37:35] of death.
[37:37] That's the glory of the cross.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; That sin having been defeated and the
[37:42] price paid. Therefore, there is this
[37:43] revelation to recognize I don't have to
[37:45] die for that sin.
[37:48] So, brother Brandham is told, "There's
[37:49] only one thing you must do. You must be
[37:51] more sincere." And he said, 'I said,
[37:52] 'Well, God forgive me for my
[37:54] uncincerity. Like how he said that
[37:56] uncincerity fits with the nomenclature
[37:58] we've been using. And let me have
[38:00] sincerity.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; And I raised up my hands to him again.
[38:04] There was this great something come over
[38:05] me, just lifted me up. SEEMED LIKE MY
[38:08] WHOLE BODY WAS CHARGED WITH SOMETHING.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; And I looked at the serpent and when he
[38:13] started towards me and he couldn't do it
[38:15] yet. And I said, "Satan, in the name of
[38:18] G the Lord Jesus Christ, I bind you."
[38:21] And the serpent, a blue smoke flew out
[38:24] of him. And he curled up and made that
[38:27] sign like an S, capital S backwards, an
[38:29] and sign amperand. He says it means bind
[38:33] this one or anything below him cuz he
[38:36] was the worst.
[38:38] BLUE SMOKE FELL OUT OF HIM AND HIS TAIL
[38:40] CHOKED HIS OWN SELF TO DEATH around his
[38:42] head and he made this backward s an sign
[38:44] like like a conjunction choked at death
[38:47] and the brother was free.
[38:49] That's quite that's in this vision
[38:51] that's quite a circumstance. He said I
[38:54] bind you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[38:55] There's this power of binding. When he
[38:57] does this there's this kind of this puff
[39:00] this smoke this powder kind of
[39:01] represents the life leaving it and it
[39:03] curls up. It kind of chokes itself and
[39:05] it's twisted around to it looks like
[39:06] that and sign the amperand. He says, "I
[39:10] WENT OVER AND MASHED ON IT." I said,
[39:11] "Now I've got to find out about this
[39:13] because it's a vision." And I hit on the
[39:15] thing and it it turned like looked like
[39:18] a handle on a glass handle on a picture
[39:22] just made it solid crystal.
[39:25] Think of that. Took something living and
[39:28] then when he he spoke to it and he
[39:31] actually caused it to turn to glass.
[39:34] And I said, "Think of that. How quick
[39:36] the blue smoke was life and everything
[39:38] that left it, all the elements, and it
[39:40] turned to glass." There's been a
[39:42] transformation process.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; We're now through the application of the
[39:46] word, through the binding power, this
[39:48] thing that was flesh and moving and had
[39:50] the power to take away life. It is now
[39:53] the life has left it. Those elements
[39:54] have been transformed and it's been
[39:55] turned into glass. He says like crystal.
[39:58] Just then a voice came against says,
[39:59] "You can unbind him also." I said,
[40:01] 'Then, Satan, that I might know, I
[40:03] unbind you.' And when he did, he started
[40:04] coming to life again, wiggling. I'm not
[40:07] going to try to get too bogged down in
[40:08] this, but think of this. He had power to
[40:11] bind in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:13] Christ.
[40:14] But he didn't have to invoke the name to
[40:16] unbind it.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Because which one of you are going to
[40:19] say, "In the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:20] Christ, I want an addiction to those
[40:22] things which I have conquered and
[40:23] overcome. Come back again and cause me
[40:24] to stumble and fall."
[40:27] None of you is going to do it. or none
[40:28] of you. If you're from Missouri, you're
[40:31] not going to do it. Why? You wouldn't
[40:32] invoke the name to do it. But yet in
[40:34] your lips, you have power to resurrect
[40:37] dead natures.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; You have the ABILITY TO SUBJECT
[40:41] YOURSELVES to things that you have
[40:43] absolute power over being a sealed son
[40:45] or daughter of God. So that I might know
[40:48] I unbind you. When it did, he started
[40:50] coming to life again wiggling. I SAID, I
[40:51] BIND YOU BACK IN THE NAME OF Jesus
[40:53] Christ. Let me say this. If you have
[40:54] inadvertently loosed anything in your
[40:56] life that ought not to be loosed in the
[40:58] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, BIND IT RIGHT BACK
[40:59] AGAIN.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; If you've opened it up through
[41:01] confession, YOU'VE OPENED IT THROUGH
[41:03] ignorance or or negligence or rebellion
[41:05] in the name OF LORD JESUS CHRIST, BIND
[41:07] THAT BACK UP AGAIN. BRING IT UNDER THE
[41:08] BLOOD.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Don't allow any of these things to
[41:11] exist. Says, I bind you back in the name
[41:14] of Jesus Christ. And when it did, the
[41:16] smoke flew out of him again and he
[41:18] choked himself right back again and
[41:20] turned to crystal. I'm not I'm not
[41:23] pushing it too much. I don't often do
[41:24] this, so you could just let me do it on
[41:26] a Wednesday night with so few here. He
[41:28] glazed them.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he did. He turned
[41:33] them into glass.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Said it looked like glass. It looked
[41:36] like crystal.
[41:38] And as he did, he says when he did that,
[41:40] the voice said, "Now you must be more
[41:41] sincere than what you are to do this."
[41:45] What did it take? Sincerity.
[41:50] Sincerity.
[41:51] We have the truth, but we need it with
[41:53] sincerity.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; I need to be I need to be sealed with
[41:56] the Holy Spirit.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; I need that. I I need God's work in my
[42:00] life to be be rendered sure by the
[42:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I don't need
[42:04] religion. I don't need pretense. I don't
[42:05] need politics. I don't need the eagle
[42:07] belt buckle and the Stson hat and and
[42:10] the replica briefcase. I don't need I
[42:12] don't need any of those things.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; I need a genuine experience with Jesus
[42:15] Christ.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; That's what I need. And I need sincerity
[42:19] with this message. Brother said, "Don't
[42:20] bring no smut on it." And I don't I
[42:23] don't want the the smut of uh the the
[42:26] the politics and the pretense and the
[42:28] human polishing to try to make it
[42:29] pretty. It's pretty on its own.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful just the way that God
[42:33] intends it to be.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; And so, as brother Brandham is
[42:37] expressing here, this power, this great
[42:38] vision that he shares with us so that we
[42:40] could see an example ourselves here in
[42:42] the end time, there's going to be a
[42:43] translation. THERE'S GOT TO BE POWER
[42:45] over sin and death.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; He gave power to bind it. And in doing
[42:49] so, it turned to glass.
[42:52] Revelations 15:es 2:3.
[42:57] John sees this remarkable
[43:01] scene and he says, "And I saw as it were
[43:03] a sea of glass mingled with fire." Had
[43:06] the image to me of that glazing process
[43:09] where something that has been fashioned
[43:11] and fitted with this powder of glass has
[43:14] now been mingled with fire to where it's
[43:15] glazed smooth. kind of speaks of a
[43:19] smooth sea, but there's something. It's
[43:20] a sea of glass mingled with fire.
[43:23] And them that had gotten the victory
[43:25] over the beast and over his image and
[43:27] over his mark and over the number of his
[43:28] name stand on the sea of glass having
[43:31] the harps of God.
[43:34] I want you to recognize this. The sea no
[43:36] longer retains the character it once
[43:38] had.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; They're not walking on water. What would
[43:42] have at one time been a sea has now been
[43:44] described as glass because it's been
[43:46] mingled with fire.
[43:50] It's been fit with glass.
[43:54] They have the harps of God. Again, God
[43:56] is an artist. He has his harps. He's a
[43:58] musician. And they sing the song of
[43:59] Moses, the servant of God, and the song
[44:01] of the lamb, saying, "Great and
[44:02] marvelous are thy works, Lord God
[44:04] Almighty. Just and true are thy ways,
[44:06] thou king of saints."
[44:09] The words that are meant here, what John
[44:12] saw as it were, a sea of glass,
[44:15] it's worthy of much more time than we're
[44:17] going to give it now as we close. But
[44:19] this sea was an emblem of sorrow and
[44:21] trouble.
[44:22] Scripturally, it was numbered among the
[44:24] the weaknesses or the deprivation of
[44:26] nature because of its terrible uh
[44:28] terribleness.
[44:30] Scripture and even allegorically, even
[44:32] in literature, it's tied to hunger and
[44:34] thirst and pain. Represents sorrow,
[44:37] WEARINESS, THE UNKNOWN, DARKNESS, THE
[44:39] DEPTHS. It represents death.
[44:43] And to think, as one writer put it,
[44:46] among the gains of heaven, it's
[44:48] recorded, there shall be no more sea.
[44:52] That that's one of the the the pluses to
[44:54] heaven. When he heaven is being
[44:57] described, there's no more sea. So the
[44:59] sea represents something terrible,
[45:01] something dark. Revelations 13 chapter
[45:04] 1, he says, "I stood upon the sand of
[45:05] the sea." So here he is on the sand. He
[45:07] beholds THE SEA AND SAW A BEAST RISE UP
[45:09] OUT OF THE SEA.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; SO IT IS ACTUALLY FROM THE SEA THAT THIS
[45:14] BEAST comes forth. It's
[45:16] &gt;&gt; from the SEA THAT THERE'S DEATH. THERE'S
[45:18] ALL TERRIBLE UNKNOWN THINGS. THERE'S
[45:19] SORROW. THERE'S PAIN. THERE'S HUNGER.
[45:22] THERE'S GREAT TREPIDATION. THERE'S THIS
[45:24] ENDLESSNESS DARKNESS TO IT. The beast
[45:27] rising up out of it. But now in
[45:28] Revelations 15, it says they stand on
[45:30] the sea. Why? It was the sea of glass
[45:34] mingled with fire.
[45:36] It had been permanently changed.
[45:39] He had gone through this process. We say
[45:41] a a an unglazed pot isn't finished yet.
[45:46] We can see that this sea now has has
[45:48] been abolished in Revelations.
[45:51] this the fire of God has completely
[45:54] transformed what would have been this
[45:55] dark water and now it's a sea of glass
[46:00] and now they're standing on it. What
[46:01] does it tell us? There's victory over
[46:02] that serpent.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; There's victory over unbelief.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Victory over the beast, his image, his
[46:09] mark,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; the number of his name.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; There's power over all that.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; So today spiritually you as a believer,
[46:16] you stand on a sea of glass. That's
[46:18] right.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; You stand on the sea of glass mingled
[46:22] with fire. The soul sealed, Satan sealed
[46:26] out.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; THE SOUL BEING SEALED BY THAT POWER OF
[46:31] GOD, BY THAT SEALING OF THE HOLY GHOST
[46:33] HAS NOT ONLY SEALED INSIDE OF YOU
[46:34] ETERNAL LIFE, BUT IT KEEPS SATAN OUT.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; That's the beautiful IMAGE OF WHAT'S
[46:39] BEING EXPRESSED IN THE SEA OF GLASS. IT
[46:41] DOESN'T RETAIN ITS DEPTHS ANYMORE.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOW GLASS. IT'S THEY'RE NOT WALKING
[46:46] ON WATER. WHATEVER WAS THERE IS GONE.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; It it it exists NO LONGER.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; IT'S NEVER TO RISE AGAIN AND CAUSE
[46:55] TROUBLE. IT CAN NEVER RISE AND BE THE
[46:57] SPECTRE OF DEATH. IT CAN NEVER RISE AND
[46:59] BE THE SPECTRE OF PAIN. THAT IS WHAT'S
[47:01] MEANT WHEN YOU STAND UPON A SEA OF
[47:02] GLASS. THERE HAS BEEN A SOMETHING COME
[47:04] THAT HAS COMPLETELY REMOVED IT ALTO
[47:06] TOGETHER.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; And you as a believer,
[47:12] there's no there's no power of sin and
[47:14] death over you anymore. Amen.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; You stand on a sea of glass.
[47:18] You stand on a solid foundation.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; They stood on it having the harps of
[47:24] God. What a beautiful image.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you could come to your
[47:28] instruments this evening.
[47:31] I want to present it to you in a number
[47:33] of different ways, but
[47:35] I don't want the glaze of burning lips.
[47:39] I don't want the glaze of vain worship,
[47:42] but my heart be far from God. I want the
[47:44] sincerity. I want to be unwaxed and I
[47:46] want to be unglazed.
[47:49] But then I also I don't want to just be
[47:51] shed of all my pretense and view myself
[47:54] as a broken sinner and think that I
[47:57] could somehow continue to exist
[48:02] in in this sinful state
[48:04] in perpetuity and claim the grace of
[48:07] God.
[48:09] I I've been thinking about it a lot this
[48:10] week and I maybe I probably perhaps I
[48:13] probably should have maybe kind of would
[48:15] have should have written it down.
[48:21] But there's something to be said about
[48:23] how
[48:24] one feels
[48:27] they I come to God and I can come to him
[48:29] with all my sin and all my brokenness.
[48:33] And then when they can retain certain
[48:36] things, it kind of tells you what they
[48:37] think it can tell you what they think it
[48:39] is.
[48:41] That somehow I have been able to be
[48:43] impacted by his presence, look into his
[48:46] word, be changed, make a confession,
[48:47] [music]
[48:48] but then there's all these other things
[48:50] I can continue to exist with, maybe make
[48:53] excuses for. Well, we're all sinners and
[48:55] we all make mistakes and we're always
[48:57] going to do this and there's all this
[48:58] all this ungodliness that what gets what
[49:00] glazed over. And it kind of tells you
[49:03] what they think of Christ
[49:05] &gt;&gt; there. There is no power over that.
[49:08] There is no power over that. There is no
[49:09] power over that. That one ain't doing
[49:12] that. That one ain't doing that. Ain't
[49:13] doing that. Right? There's all these
[49:15] things everyone's doing. Everyone's
[49:16] doing this. Everyone's doing that.
[49:17] THERE'S ALL THESE different things. SAY,
[49:18] WELL, THEY'RE JUST TELLING you what they
[49:19] think is in the word of God.
[49:25] But I believe that we should look at it
[49:27] in the sense of this. This is righteous.
[49:29] This is purity. This is holiness. If I
[49:31] don't see it in me, I believe it can
[49:32] come.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I believe it can change me.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; So then I want to be
[49:39] genuine and sincere before God, honest
[49:42] about my mistakes and my failures, but I
[49:43] don't want to stay that way
[49:45] &gt;&gt; cuz that's not what I see in Christ.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I was reading this some of these
[49:53] statements this past week. I just don't
[49:55] know how many we could continue to or
[49:57] how long we'll remain on this subject. I
[49:59] just had one more in in my heart for
[50:00] this Sunday using this process of
[50:03] forming the clay. And it's in the very
[50:06] beginning that a potter [music] will
[50:08] tell you this that if you're going to be
[50:09] using if it's not hand building, but
[50:11] you're going to be using a will, the
[50:12] most important thing you can do is get
[50:13] [music] get that lump right in the
[50:16] center.
[50:18] It's got to be centered.
[50:20] And so if you weren't wanting to come
[50:22] Sunday, you can just tell yourself
[50:23] you've heard the whole just [music]
[50:24] needs to be centered.
[50:27] There's so many different statements,
[50:28] brother. In the sermon identification,
[50:31] it says we want to be
[50:34] make this Bible our looking glass.
[50:35] [music] We want this Bible to be our
[50:37] looking glass and let ourselves be
[50:39] molded by his character.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; I want to see Christ as he is.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Not how he's rendered in stained glass.
[50:47] NOT HOW HE'S PICTURED BY THE uh the
[50:49] Baroque artist of AGES GONE BY. NOT HOW
[50:52] HOFFMAN would represent him to be. Not
[50:54] not in the beauty of the artist, but I
[50:56] WANT TO SEE HIM AS GOD MADE HIM, AS GOD
[50:59] DESIRES HIM TO BE REVEALED IN HIS WORD,
[51:00] AS GOD HAS EXPRESSED HIM IN THESE LAST
[51:02] DAYS THROUGH THE PREACHING OF THE
[51:04] GOSPEL, THROUGH THE REVELATION OF JESUS
[51:05] CHRIST. I I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM FOR THE
[51:08] BIBLE TELLS ME THAT I SHALL BE LIKE HIM
[51:10] WHEN I SEE HIM AS he is. [music]
[51:12] But if I'm viewing him through a filter,
[51:14] I'm viewing him through prism, if I'm
[51:16] viewing him through a glass darkly, then
[51:18] there's retain some modifications.
[51:22] But I want to look into his glory. I
[51:23] want to look into the glaze. I WANT TO
[51:25] SEE HIM AS he really is
[51:27] &gt;&gt; and let myself be molded by his
[51:29] character
[51:30] &gt;&gt; and having his character, his mind,
[51:32] letting the mind that was in Christ be
[51:34] in us.
[51:36] this fellowship of brother Steven Bryant
[51:39] and he would on the the subject of
[51:41] artificial intelligence
[51:44] and and there's so many different
[51:46] interesting parallels to what the
[51:47] world's trying to do through artificial
[51:49] means and really what it means for the
[51:51] believer to have the mind of Christ
[51:54] to be able to make these calculations
[51:56] and these processes.
[51:59] He says that what was his mind to do?
[52:02] The mind that was in Christ. If we want
[52:05] the mind of Christ in us, he says, what
[52:07] was it to do? What was that mind? Always
[52:08] to stay with the father's word.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; No matter what looked glossy
[52:13] and what looked this way, it didn't make
[52:15] any difference to him. The father's word
[52:17] is what counted.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, you're kind of you're wired I
[52:20] say kind of. We're wired to the the
[52:23] neon, the flashy, the glamour.
[52:28] All right. If you if our church had a a
[52:31] a a a summer basketball league, right?
[52:35] Fall pickle ball. Write these down.
[52:37] These are great ideas. Coming fresh
[52:38] right now. These coming right here. Get
[52:39] the website going. Arizona believers
[52:42] court. All right. We could do mock
[52:43] trials. We can do pickle ball,
[52:45] basketball. If we had a lot of things to
[52:47] offer, man, we you could have a lot of
[52:50] people coming to like moths to a barn
[52:52] light, right?
[52:54] You hear they have softball. Oh, you
[52:55] hear they hear you all get season
[52:58] tickets to spring training games when
[52:59] you [music] come. There's a lot of ways
[53:01] that you could have cash prizes.
[53:04] People don't know it, but we always put
[53:06] a $100 bill underneath the seats on
[53:08] Wednesday nights.
[53:10] Maybe we do, maybe we don't.
[53:13] There's a way that people would come for
[53:15] those things.
[53:18] He says, "But no matter how glossy what
[53:20] it looked, it doesn't make any
[53:21] difference to him. The father's word is
[53:22] what counted. I trust at the end of the
[53:24] day that's your attraction.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; The word of God is what matters.
[53:27] Everywhere where he met the devil, he
[53:29] never used his power to defeat him, he
[53:31] used the word because that was him.
[53:34] Isn't it great to know that you have
[53:35] been given the word? You haven't been
[53:37] given the same life experience as Jesus
[53:39] Christ. You haven't been given the same
[53:41] birth that Jesus Christ was given. We
[53:43] can't claim all the experiences that he
[53:45] had, but we do have the very same word.
[53:49] And Jesus didn't use his peculiar birth.
[53:51] He didn't use his sinlessness. He used
[53:53] THE WORD TO EXERCISE POWER OVER THE
[53:56] GREATEST, therefore even the least.
[53:59] Says he never wrote a book when he was
[54:01] on earth. As far as we know, he never
[54:03] wrote. But one time that was in the
[54:06] sand. You know, they say that it's the
[54:08] sand that if you expose it to heat,
[54:11] [music] you get it hot enough, it turns
[54:12] to glass because of the silica, because
[54:14] the the particles that are already in
[54:16] it.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Says he wrote in the sand, then erased
[54:19] it. says probably afterwards. Why didn't
[54:23] he write a word? Because he was the
[54:24] word.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; You don't have to aspire to some great
[54:28] achievement. Ah, I want to write a book.
[54:29] I want to write poetry. I want to paint
[54:30] a work. I want to do that. No, you don't
[54:32] need to do that. He lived the word. We
[54:33] don't need so many books when you become
[54:35] a written epistle of God.
[54:38] That's what God wants you to be. Images
[54:40] of him.
[54:42] That is what you're called to be. And
[54:45] our whole theme this entire year has
[54:47] been in my mind, well, what does he look
[54:48] like? I believe in my heart I could
[54:51] present any [music] one of you tonight
[54:55] as this is what Christ looks like.
[54:58] Brother Lucas, even 20 years ago when
[55:00] you wore I'm a pepper, right? And it was
[55:03] kind of like I'm a pepper, right? Stand
[55:06] in a t-shirt say that's what Christ
[55:07] looks like in 2001 or whatever it was
[55:11] cuz we got all sorts of IMAGES OF WHAT
[55:13] CHRIST WOULD LOOK LIKE. WHAT WOULD HE
[55:14] LOOK LIKE? What would he look like? He
[55:16] looks like what he looks like when he
[55:17] lives through you. And I want to yield
[55:20] my members to him that he can live
[55:21] through me because what I'm called to be
[55:24] is an epistle of God. I want to [music]
[55:26] be an image of him. And it's going to be
[55:29] this word manifested.
[55:31] Unglazed. I hope so from the world.
[55:35] But I hope that you haven't been
[55:36] untouched by the master's [music] hand.
[55:40] And to the extent that you need to be,
[55:42] trust me, he's willing.
[55:45] He's willing. If we could stand this
[55:47] evening
[55:51] and just [music] express our our love to
[55:54] him and our gratitude to him. Isn't God
[55:56] good to us?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; So kind. He's so gracious. When people
[56:00] ask me how our church is doing, I find
[56:02] myself saying over and over again, God
[56:05] has been so gracious to us.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So as we worship tonight, just open up
[56:10] your heart to him. A and see yourself as
[56:13] a vessel that he wants to fill and that
[56:15] he wants to use for [music] his glory.
