[0:00] to be here. If you'd like to turn with
[0:02] me to
[0:05] John 17
[0:07] verses 20 and 24
[0:18] and let's just continue to pray for
[0:20] those that are not here or pastor and
[0:22] his family. Let's just keep them in
[0:23] prayer. And uh if you have anybody in
[0:25] your heart, anybody
[0:28] um with any needs, let's just bring that
[0:31] to the Lord as we pray after this
[0:33] scripture.
[0:35] John 17:20 24 says, "Neither pray I for
[0:41] these alone, but for them also which
[0:44] shall be shall believe on me through
[0:47] their word, that they all may be one, as
[0:51] thou, Father, are in me, and I in thee,
[0:54] and they also being one in us, and the
[0:57] world may believe that thou hast sent
[1:00] me. And the glory which thou has gavest
[1:03] uh me, I have given them that they may
[1:06] be one even as we are one.
[1:09] I in them and thou in me that they may
[1:12] be perfect in one
[1:15] and that the world may know that thou
[1:18] has sent me and thou hast loved them and
[1:21] thou has loved me. For father,
[1:24] I will that they also whom has given me
[1:28] will be uh w with me be where I am that
[1:33] they may behold my glory which thou has
[1:36] given me for thou lovest me before the
[1:39] foundation of the world. Let us bow our
[1:42] heads.
[1:43] Heavenly father, Lord, what a beautiful
[1:46] scripture you have given us. Father,
[1:48] what a desire you have for your people.
[1:51] Lord, we just ask that as this uh
[1:54] continuation of this service happens,
[1:57] Lord, we just ask that you take full
[1:58] control, Father, and you may be able to
[2:01] speak to us in a way that we may apply
[2:03] it in our lives and may we may walk away
[2:06] better and closer to you, Father. Lord,
[2:08] we thank you for everything that you
[2:10] have done. And Lord, if there's any need
[2:12] here, if there's anyone that is is
[2:15] thinking about somebody, Lord, and for
[2:17] all those that are not here, our pastor
[2:19] and his family, Lord, we just ask that
[2:21] you take control of that situation, Lord
[2:23] Jesus, that you be with our pastor and
[2:25] those that are not here, Father, we give
[2:27] it all unto you in the name of the Lord
[2:29] Jesus Christ. We submit to you. Amen.
[2:31] And amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[2:35] What what an uh appropriate
[2:39] uh song that Jesus in the in the center
[2:42] of it all because that's um his desire
[2:45] here with God, his prayer. He says,
[2:48] "Lord, that I may be in them and then
[2:51] them in me." Yes. And so um that was his
[2:55] full desire. Brother Brandham, he he
[2:58] says in the message, things that are to
[3:01] be, he explains it perfect. He says
[3:04] Jesus only asked one thing in his prayer
[3:07] to the father. You know that what what
[3:09] that was one thing after all his
[3:12] sacrifice that he did here on earth the
[3:14] life that he lived the path that he
[3:16] walked he asked for one thing that where
[3:20] I am they may be there also. He asked
[3:23] for our fellowship and that's the only
[3:26] thing he asked the father in the prayer
[3:28] for your companionship.
[3:32] God's true desire for us is so that we
[3:37] may be him and because we are one with
[3:41] him and another person's one with him
[3:44] and we are one with him together we
[3:46] become one together as as a family a
[3:50] body of believers
[3:52] and we know that brother Brandham he
[3:54] expressed and we always we hear it and
[3:56] we know it that Jesus was the very heart
[3:59] of God so that was his heart being
[4:02] expressed his heart was a longing to
[4:06] fellowship with his people. Brother
[4:09] Brandham, he he spoke many messages on
[4:11] how God longs for fellowship. That God
[4:15] created the people, God created his
[4:18] children to fellowship with him. He
[4:21] says, uh, I I want to point specifically
[4:24] to a a quote here in God's provided way
[4:26] for of approach to fellowship. He says,
[4:30] "I wonder about that that if we go back
[4:33] to the beginning, all things begin in
[4:35] Genesis." And in Genesis, we find out
[4:38] that God created man for his fellowship.
[4:41] God uh loved to come down and fellowship
[4:46] with his people. God in the beginning,
[4:48] Genesis 1, in the beginning, God, the
[4:51] word in the Hebrew is ll Elohim,
[4:54] allsufficient one, self-existing one,
[4:56] the strong one. And in him was
[4:59] attributes to be a father. In him was
[5:02] attribute uh to be a son. In him was
[5:05] attributes to be a savior. In him was
[5:08] attributes to be a healer. In him was
[5:10] attributes to be God. There was nothing
[5:13] but God and God alone. Now that sounds
[5:17] like a contradiction because he he's
[5:19] talking about many things in him. But
[5:22] all those things within him, he was all
[5:25] alone, right? He was all by himself.
[5:28] There was nothing else that was
[5:29] existing. But in him, he wanted all
[5:32] those things. And if anybody's ever
[5:34] studied that word Elohim, brother
[5:36] Brandham said he's this existing one,
[5:40] but that's a word that is a plural. And
[5:42] brother Brandham, he's explaining here
[5:44] and revealing that in him there was a
[5:46] plurality in him. Even though he's a
[5:49] singular god and he's we're not
[5:52] worshiping u multiple gods or anything
[5:54] like that but but it's one god but there
[5:58] are many attributes in him many desires
[6:01] many longings within him and and um and
[6:06] so that was the very heart of God and
[6:08] then you see Jesus walking and brother
[6:11] the of God and and you see his heart
[6:14] being expressed we see God you know in
[6:17] in types and shadows, but here Jesus
[6:20] Christ fully expressed his heart, how
[6:22] much he loved his people and his longing
[6:25] was for his people. And and I truly
[6:28] believe that a Christian
[6:31] into Christ, that is the goal right
[6:33] there. There's many goals. There's many
[6:36] things, but whenever you you become a
[6:38] Christian, the goal is a relationship
[6:40] with Jesus Christ. Knowledge, everything
[6:43] else will come later. Revelation comes
[6:46] later. What is your relationship with
[6:48] Christ? Because that is the first thing
[6:52] that we're looking for. That's the
[6:54] thing, the center of everything that God
[6:57] desired was fellowship.
[7:01] And and so now we see Jesus expressing
[7:03] that saying, "Lord, that I may be in
[7:06] them, you in me, and I and them in me.
[7:09] Lord, let us be one together."
[7:13] So, so it's funny how he says all of
[7:16] these things were in him, yet it was God
[7:19] alone
[7:20] all by himself. And and um my message
[7:23] today is is from the heart to the home.
[7:26] And I'm not so much going to talk about
[7:28] principles of home life, but I want to
[7:31] focus on one principle that that's been
[7:33] laid and has been patterned throughout
[7:35] the whole Bible and in our lives. And
[7:37] that is that that creation comes from
[7:40] within.
[7:42] that that God he didn't get inspiration
[7:46] from something else. There was nothing
[7:47] else. God didn't have in a sense where
[7:51] he was lacking. So there was something
[7:54] lacking from him. So he wanted something
[7:56] out there. But everything that God
[7:58] longed for and everything that he needed
[8:01] was within him. That God wanted
[8:05] something that was already bubbling up
[8:07] inside him. And and I want us to think
[8:10] about that in us that that our our home
[8:14] life, our our work life, everything that
[8:17] consists around us that God gave us this
[8:20] unique partnership that we're not
[8:24] influenced by the things that outside,
[8:27] but we're supposed to produce from
[8:29] within. Yes. Relationships that we
[8:32] foster, things that we do, people that
[8:34] we meet, things all the things that are
[8:37] around us, our world comes from within
[8:40] us.
[8:43] So God, he he's he wants his family, but
[8:46] it's going to come from him. Heard a
[8:48] brother say something that blew my mind
[8:51] years ago. He's God he didn't want a
[8:54] family. God is his family.
[8:57] So from within him his whole family
[8:59] comes in. So now it's like well
[9:03] technically if you want to speak like on
[9:04] our families and and well I so and so
[9:07] didn't come from me. I met them at at
[9:09] Costco and that's how I met them. You
[9:13] whoever however it works. But God in the
[9:16] beginning already knew and whenever a a
[9:19] fellowship between a husband and wife
[9:21] come it's they become one person and out
[9:25] of father the family is projected. So
[9:29] how however the heart is that's the life
[9:32] that you're going to live. The Bible
[9:34] says we're going to read later on that
[9:36] that the issues of life come from the
[9:39] heart.
[9:40] So there is a there is a guard of the
[9:42] heart that needs to take place in our
[9:44] lives because everything that is around
[9:49] us, everything that we produce,
[9:51] everything that we have is a result of
[9:54] what's within here. Yeah. So he was all
[9:58] alone. A brother once said all alone or
[10:01] alone means all in one. All one.
[10:05] God is one. He's singular yet he wasn't
[10:08] solitary.
[10:10] He had he had desires. He had people
[10:12] within him. That's why we can hear in in
[10:15] Job where it says, "Where were you when
[10:17] I laid the foundations of the of the
[10:19] world? Sons and daughters were shouting
[10:22] for joy." There was something there was
[10:24] people. There there was thoughts,
[10:27] attributes, there was you and I, him.
[10:31] We were his thoughts. We was his
[10:34] desires. So he begin to produce those
[10:37] everything the Bible says was good.
[10:40] Everything that comes out of him is good
[10:42] because that is the heart of God. So God
[10:46] he can't um in a sense he can't grab
[10:50] another entity and and cause that to be
[10:52] his family. Everything comes from within
[10:55] him.
[10:56] If you would like to turn with me to uh
[10:58] Deuteronomy
[11:00] um
[11:02] chapter 6 and verse 4
[11:05] and just uh mark that in your Bibles
[11:07] because we'll read a little bit more
[11:09] later on. But I just want to focus on
[11:11] just verse 4.
[11:16] Deuteronomy chapter 4, chapter 6:4
[11:24] says,
[11:27] "Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one
[11:30] Lord."
[11:32] Very, very simple scripture, but there's
[11:35] a lot to unpack because the word one
[11:38] there is doesn't mean just he that that
[11:42] he's one. Now, I'm I'm just trying to
[11:45] focus on this principle and then and God
[11:48] willing, we'll go a little farther, but
[11:50] focus on this principle of who God is.
[11:53] The Bible says, "The Lord our God is
[11:55] one." That now that word is echo, which
[11:59] is often translated as one. And at first
[12:02] glance, it it seems like this one
[12:05] person, but this word, it denotes a
[12:08] composite unity.
[12:11] In in Numbers 13:23,
[12:13] they talk about a cluster of grapes and
[12:16] and that's that's the same word echod
[12:20] where it was one, but there's a lot of
[12:22] grapes in there. Same thing with with uh
[12:26] Exodus 36:13.
[12:29] It's talking about the tabernacle in
[12:31] parts were joined together and became
[12:33] one. Echar multiple pieces became one
[12:37] structure.
[12:38] So here it says that our the lord our
[12:42] god he is one but he is consisting of
[12:47] many parts. Now, now that doesn't mean
[12:50] that that he has many separate parts,
[12:52] but it's all within him
[12:55] and that's us, right? That's his people.
[12:58] That's his creation. It all flows from
[13:01] him. God in that that's the amazing
[13:04] thing about the difference between us
[13:06] and Satan. Between God and Satan
[13:10] that God has this unique thing that when
[13:13] he creates, it's out of nothing.
[13:16] When inspiration that's true inspiration
[13:19] that's through the heart of creation
[13:22] that when something is created there is
[13:25] no inspiration outside
[13:28] there is nothing that is influencing
[13:30] there is nothing that is making you make
[13:32] decision but it's all flowing from
[13:35] within that is the true essence what
[13:37] creation is Satan all he is is a copycat
[13:42] that that's what what caused the whole
[13:45] issue because he couldn't create. He
[13:48] couldn't have that artistic of true
[13:51] creation. So all he did was grab what
[13:54] God did. He copied it and perverted it
[13:56] every single time.
[14:00] Now men in a fallen state will we do the
[14:03] same thing. But when we get into uh
[14:06] connection with God, then we begin to
[14:09] create things from within.
[14:12] Then we begin from out of the heart the
[14:14] issues of life come out of from out of
[14:17] your heart you begin to to be a father
[14:20] begin to be a mother begin to be a good
[14:22] coworker begin to be a friend out of the
[14:27] and it's not out of of of different
[14:29] motives or or how this person me well
[14:32] that I like that person because he he
[14:34] likes me I like that person because
[14:37] we're really good friends. No, it's out
[14:39] of the heart.
[14:41] Out of the issue of your heart, you
[14:43] begin to love. You begin to to
[14:47] communicate. You begin to build
[14:49] relationships out of your own heart.
[14:52] That's the way God consisted us that uh
[14:55] made us. That's the way he he made
[14:57] single thing. That's his pattern.
[15:00] So, um here here he says that he he was
[15:04] all one. And and the amazing thing about
[15:06] these two words where it says Lord our
[15:09] God. In Hebrew, it's Yahweh. Lord our
[15:13] God, Elohim.
[15:15] Lord
[15:16] Yahweh is a singular noun and Elohim is
[15:20] the plural. And and it's showing that
[15:23] that this singular God
[15:26] that the plurality inside of him, which
[15:28] is of us, all composited in a unity, one
[15:34] person. Amen. That that should be our
[15:38] home.
[15:40] That should be a church. Whenever every
[15:45] spirit in one accord, it becomes one.
[15:49] It becomes one thought. It's it's
[15:52] amazing because um
[15:55] here in Genesis 2:24 when when Adam and
[15:59] Eve were married and he says when he
[16:02] separated her and then he says now these
[16:05] two shall become one flesh. It's the
[16:07] same word echar one.
[16:10] It's it's not a two separate things now.
[16:12] It it's it's one unity.
[16:17] Out of the heart. Out of the heart we we
[16:20] love. out of the heart, everything comes
[16:23] out. You know, um it's the same thing as
[16:26] as a fountain or if you have water that
[16:30] is polluted, it doesn't matter how nice
[16:31] the is. It doesn't matter how whatever
[16:35] is uh things we built it, the structures
[16:38] around it. If the core is wrong, it
[16:43] doesn't nothing else matters.
[16:46] It's out of the flow of the heart which
[16:49] matters. That's where life comes out.
[16:53] So here another example um God he he he
[16:59] created Adam and in Genesis 2:18 it says
[17:02] that
[17:04] that it says that and the Lord said it
[17:07] is not good that man should be alone and
[17:10] I will make him a help meat for him. So
[17:13] here's this same word allin one. We know
[17:17] that through the prophet he says that he
[17:19] was Adam and Eve were in were one at
[17:23] that time. Eve's name was Adam. So it
[17:28] didn't mean he was solitary. It means
[17:30] that he there was all in one. And that's
[17:32] the way God creates everything. That's
[17:35] the way God created the purpose. Every
[17:38] single thing that out of him everything
[17:40] was going to consist and him true unity,
[17:45] true fellowship was out of him.
[17:49] That's why when we step out of his will,
[17:52] when we out of that fellowship is broke.
[17:55] Now, we could have fellowship, we could
[17:57] have those things, but then it it's
[17:59] going to be hard because true fellowship
[18:02] comes from within. And it's not
[18:03] something where you know what we need
[18:05] dinners, we need this, we need that to
[18:07] foster unity. No, brother, sister, I can
[18:10] live 300 miles away from you and we
[18:13] still have unity through the spirit.
[18:16] In one body, we we are one body through
[18:19] one spirit.
[18:21] There's people that I I never knew in
[18:23] Africa. There's people that I don't know
[18:25] in other places. Yet all one bride.
[18:30] That is true unity.
[18:33] So um he wasn't lonely. It it it was he
[18:37] because he had the relationship with
[18:39] God. He first had something with God and
[18:42] he had family within him. And and I
[18:45] truly believe like even like with young
[18:48] people and with people that are are
[18:50] looking for spouses and looking for all
[18:52] of those things, you know, over time
[18:55] when you grow up, the first thing you
[18:56] need is that relationship with the Lord.
[18:59] The first thing you need is to make sure
[19:01] that you're all in one. You're all
[19:04] intact.
[19:05] See, God, he wasn't lonely. God wasn't
[19:08] lacking. Adam, he wasn't lacking. Why?
[19:11] Because he had his wife within him. Had
[19:14] everything that he needed to replenish
[19:17] the within him.
[19:20] Nothing that he was lacking. He said,
[19:22] "Well, you know what? I need this and I
[19:23] need that to multiply the whole earth."
[19:26] Everything was in him. in him. And so
[19:29] even whenever we create and we create
[19:32] relationships, there has to be a sense
[19:35] of fullness within us.
[19:38] We have
[19:40] we have to have relationship with God
[19:42] first. God created man and he put he put
[19:48] the garden around him. He he did things
[19:50] and he allowed him to work. Allowed him
[19:52] to do things. He allowed him to be in
[19:54] the will of God. And then he he looked
[19:58] down. He said, "Man, it's not good for
[19:59] to be alone."
[20:01] Now, right after that, God didn't say,
[20:03] "Here, you know what? I'm going to get a
[20:05] wife." No, he still made him count all
[20:07] the animals and name them and all those
[20:09] things and he still allowed him to work.
[20:12] But God was preparing a man what he
[20:16] could have his family so that he could
[20:19] have his home. He he made sure that he
[20:22] was full within him first.
[20:25] He wasn't lacking anything. Brandon, he
[20:29] says in the message uh oneness. He says
[20:32] God did you notice in Genesis 1:27 he
[20:35] created uh male and female. He created
[20:38] them and now a man was um both male and
[20:42] female when it come to being in the
[20:45] spirit of feminist and masculine. Then
[20:47] God took the side aside a rib. Did you
[20:51] notice the body part was the byproduct
[20:53] but not the spirit. The body part was of
[20:57] uh the woman was a byproduct.
[21:00] After the creation had had been
[21:02] finished, God took from the side of Adam
[21:05] a rib and made a woman. But not the
[21:07] spirit. The spirit was a part of Adam.
[21:11] For he was both man and woman, fem
[21:14] spiritually speaking, both masculine and
[21:17] feminist.
[21:19] So that's that's where the true
[21:20] fellowship I truly believe that's where
[21:22] the true church, the true fellowship
[21:25] stands today. It has nothing to do with
[21:29] ordinances, order, uh, structure,
[21:33] anything like that. It comes from the
[21:37] inside of the inside which is the heart.
[21:39] Amen. It's the spirit. We could be
[21:43] different in many ways. We could have
[21:45] different hobbies. We could have
[21:47] different thoughts. We could have
[21:48] different political thoughts. Doesn't
[21:51] matter. If we have the spirit, we are
[21:54] one.
[21:56] We That's where
[21:58] true life comes out of.
[22:02] That's why there's there's this great
[22:04] fight. That's why there's a great fight
[22:06] for your mind, for your heart.
[22:09] Because if if somebody can go into that
[22:12] control tower, then they could produce
[22:14] whatever they want. The devil has no
[22:17] right to creation. But when he can
[22:20] influence a child of God, then that's
[22:22] where the trouble comes.
[22:25] So he he continues on in the message of
[22:28] Jehovah Gyra. He says like in Eden where
[22:31] Adam and Eve was in the beginning the
[22:33] same spirit. Their names was called
[22:35] Adam. See, and was both Adam and Eve
[22:38] together and was separated to go to the
[22:42] test. What happened? Eve fell by the
[22:44] word. Um, that was the word. Adam went
[22:47] after her to redeem her, but couldn't do
[22:50] it. He wasn't worthy to redeem her. So,
[22:55] even if when they were separated, yes,
[22:57] there was a test, but the Bible says
[22:59] that they together. And it just takes
[23:03] one person to step outside of the word
[23:06] to to break that fellowship in the
[23:08] beginning. But the amazing thing now is
[23:11] that the garden of Eden can set in
[23:14] individual's hearts. This was a place.
[23:17] This was a presence. So, so when one
[23:20] person stepped out, there was no sin.
[23:23] There was nothing. When sin was created,
[23:25] it separated everything and it broke
[23:28] their fellowship. Yes. In this sense,
[23:31] brothers and sisters, you could have
[23:33] Eden inside you.
[23:35] One person could step out of line. Eden
[23:38] is still here.
[23:40] One person can can leave and yet the
[23:43] source of all life can be within your
[23:45] heart and bring somebody back.
[23:48] Everything that that is God, everything
[23:51] that that you need in your journey is
[23:53] already within you. Amen. Amen. So
[23:56] there's no broken or uh broken unity in
[24:00] a sense of spirit leaves but yet it when
[24:05] somebody breaks yet somebody can be that
[24:07] garden of Eden for them. Somebody can
[24:10] stand at the door.
[24:12] I I love this this scripture and I keep
[24:14] quoting it. Um in Proverbs I believe
[24:17] it's 4:23 says keep your heart um with
[24:22] diligence.
[24:24] you you protect it because the issues of
[24:27] life come out of it or life proceeds out
[24:31] of it or or your life is determined from
[24:33] it from that heart. So, so there there
[24:37] is a match in the house if you would
[24:39] like to say in your heart. There's
[24:42] somebody you can't only with
[24:45] self-reliance guard your heart with your
[24:49] own your own intellect. You can't guard
[24:51] your car and say, you know what, uh, I
[24:53] can't do this and I can't do that. You
[24:54] got to have a man in the house.
[24:57] You got to have the Holy Spirit. You got
[24:59] to faith in the house to keep it, to
[25:02] guard it because you are the one that is
[25:07] allowing the Holy Spirit to flow from
[25:09] you and to allow others to to be a
[25:13] beneficiary of it.
[25:16] So he he um says
[25:20] so they they broke that and um and of
[25:25] course God he told them that that
[25:27] they'll surely die and and they were
[25:28] separated from God and it was caused by
[25:30] unbelief. There was a breach in the
[25:32] spirit. Brother Brandham he says it
[25:35] continues in oneness. He says, "As soon
[25:37] as the fellowship was broken between
[25:39] Adam and Eve, as soon as their
[25:40] fellowship was broke between God and
[25:42] them, their fellowship between each
[25:45] other was broke." Why? The spirit both
[25:48] left them.
[25:50] So there there's
[25:52] the essence of everything of your
[25:55] relationships, the essence of every
[25:57] single thing comes from God's spirit.
[26:00] What's in our heart? Because it even
[26:03] says um where where
[26:07] abundance of our heart, our mouths
[26:10] and he says murder, adulteries, all of
[26:13] those things come out of the heart. He
[26:16] says the most deceitful thing in a man
[26:18] is a human heart.
[26:21] So we we come to this world, brother
[26:22] Brandham even said that that we have the
[26:25] nature of the devil, but we come empty.
[26:29] So so we are only vessels. We are here
[26:33] to seek the man of the house.
[26:36] Seek the woman that it truly is meant to
[26:40] be with our heart.
[26:43] Brother Brandham talked about how how
[26:45] Adam and Eve Eve committed adultery.
[26:49] But even before she even did the act
[26:51] already did it in her mind.
[26:54] She first it has to come into drop down
[26:57] to the heart before there's any fruits
[26:59] produced.
[27:02] A lot of times, a lot of times you could
[27:04] see lives, you know, people living good
[27:07] lives and all of that, but the heart is
[27:09] already compromised.
[27:11] So, so and and one day that that life is
[27:14] going to produce what's in that heart.
[27:18] So, here he says that it it was broke
[27:21] between them. Continues on in in um
[27:25] paragraph 71 in oneness. He says, "Not
[27:27] only that, but the oneness between
[27:29] husband and wife was broken. I don't
[27:31] believe that there's any marriage that
[27:33] what it um can be what it ought to be
[27:36] without the union between husband, wife,
[27:38] and God." That's right. They'll bring up
[27:41] the children in the world and make them
[27:42] illegitimates. Give them cigarettes,
[27:44] whiskey, play cards in the sight in
[27:47] their sight, drink liquor before them.
[27:50] No matter how loyal they are to their
[27:53] marriage vows, that's sexually, that's
[27:55] flesh. But in this there's a spirit in
[27:57] there.
[27:59] There's a spirit of a sinner uh papa and
[28:02] mama no matter how loyal to their their
[28:05] children will come wrong. That's right.
[28:08] So there's there's that aspect of there
[28:11] has to be the Holy Ghost and whether
[28:14] whether the Garden of Eden is in in one
[28:16] heart, two hearts there, God can to
[28:20] produce
[28:21] and pull the wife, pull the the husband,
[28:24] pull the children because the children
[28:25] don't with the Holy Ghost. You don't
[28:28] have a package where it says, "Lord, I
[28:29] want one. I want them with the Holy
[28:31] Ghost, please." No, they don't come with
[28:33] it. They desire it and the Lord gives it
[28:35] to them. Amen. Amen. So then there there
[28:38] has to source of life there. Amen.
[28:44] So he says, well, I I know men and women
[28:47] that didn't teach their children that
[28:48] and wasn't Christians. The very thing of
[28:51] not leading them to Christ was the
[28:53] wrongest thing they could ever do
[28:54] besides the other.
[28:56] Not lead them to Christ. See, you can't
[28:59] have a correct union without it. Broken
[29:02] fellowship. So, so we can't be in
[29:05] harmony with people until you are in
[29:08] harmony with God.
[29:10] We are designed to live from the inside
[29:14] out,
[29:15] from the spirit, from the core,
[29:18] not from the out outward behavior,
[29:21] not influenced by those things. That is
[29:25] the beauty of what God has given his
[29:27] children today. That he's given us the
[29:30] the creation.
[29:32] He's given us something that we create
[29:35] our atmospheres. We are influenced by
[29:37] those things.
[29:39] So then we could create within us with
[29:42] there is an influence. There is an
[29:44] inspiration
[29:45] within us within the word allows us to
[29:49] live the good lives
[29:51] to good be good people to have harmony
[29:54] with those that don't have the Lord
[29:59] even if they they they blaspheme even
[30:02] even if they don't believe I don't care
[30:04] if you are standing on the word there is
[30:07] there is life being produced through you
[30:10] right that's that's amazing
[30:13] That is the the core of Christianity
[30:18] and it starts with your relationship
[30:19] with God.
[30:22] My relationship with God depends on my
[30:24] revelation
[30:26] depends on on uh my my relationship with
[30:30] the church, my relationship with my
[30:32] family, my relationship at work. It all
[30:35] depends on relationship with God. Amen.
[30:38] And that's the main thing I think um
[30:41] it's very simple brothers and sisters if
[30:44] you want to know Christianity if you
[30:47] want it's not about knowledge
[30:51] figure out how you can get close to God
[30:54] young people that's the best thing out
[30:57] Lord how do I get close to you how do I
[31:00] receive more of you and when you do that
[31:03] then it doesn't matter you don't have to
[31:05] change anything
[31:07] that amazing
[31:08] I once heard somebody says said uh when
[31:11] somebody was trying to quit smoking and
[31:13] all of that there was a brother that
[31:15] said just the Holy Ghost and doesn't
[31:18] matter give them a cigarette doesn't
[31:19] matter why because the nature changes
[31:23] there's something where where all those
[31:25] things if there's hatred if there's
[31:28] doubt if there's confusion all those
[31:30] things draw
[31:33] some it'll be from one day to the next
[31:36] some people.
[31:38] It just depends on how strong your will
[31:41] is. Sometimes, you know, one of the
[31:44] coolest things to see is when and it
[31:47] sounds bad, but when a a cowboy breaks a
[31:49] horse, that's what they call it.
[31:52] Whenever they tame the horse, it's a
[31:55] stallion. It it kicks and and how the
[31:57] Bible explains how strong these these
[32:00] beasts are. Yeah. Yet yet whenever he he
[32:05] breaks horse and and he tames him then
[32:08] it becomes this this beautiful horse
[32:12] where you just two clicks and it'll just
[32:14] go this way and then you one little tug
[32:17] and it'll it'll start. That's what
[32:18] starts happening whenever we begin to
[32:21] protect our heart. Our heart is unruly
[32:24] or our heart and our body is unruly
[32:27] brothers and sisters. Man, if you let
[32:29] it, it'll kill. If you let it, it'll
[32:31] lie. If you let it, it'll deceive.
[32:34] That's man, we're just stallions that
[32:37] just want to kick and want to do
[32:39] whatever we want to do. And then the
[32:41] allow the Holy Spirit to sit there and
[32:44] begin to say, "Nope, go this way. Nope,
[32:47] do this." And it breaks us more and more
[32:51] and forms us into the mind of Christ.
[32:56] Makes us to where we we want to hear the
[32:59] word. And not that we just were kicking
[33:02] and screaming just to come to church.
[33:06] You know, I I've always I've said this
[33:08] few times already. I don't know about
[33:10] here, but how you don't have to convince
[33:13] somebody that's in the world to go out
[33:15] and party and drink. Imagine calling
[33:18] your buddy and say, "Hey, man. Hey,
[33:20] we're we're going to go out on this
[33:21] Friday night. Come in, man. Everything's
[33:24] in all cool." And I like, "Oh, man."
[33:27] Again
[33:28] another one go party have a good time I
[33:33] guess. No his nature is to do that
[33:38] nature is wants to do those things. So
[33:40] what he all right man I'll bring my
[33:42] money and I'll do this and I'll do that
[33:44] just so I can go over there. brother and
[33:46] sister when when it says it's time for
[33:49] Sunday man sometimes we're just like
[33:52] Sunday again
[33:55] man gotta go to church I know the body
[33:58] sometimes is tired but the spirit has
[34:00] said I want more
[34:02] why because the nature changed there's
[34:06] change of nature says Lord I want more
[34:09] tired I know it's it's a Wednesday but
[34:12] I'm I'm putting this body in subjection
[34:15] That's right. I'm guarding my heart.
[34:18] Whatever thought that says, no, don't or
[34:22] you know what, I'm tired of this or I
[34:23] don't believe that. You guard it and you
[34:25] kick it out because the man of the house
[34:27] is there. That's right. When you kick it
[34:30] out and you allow Christ to live in you,
[34:33] right? There there's a scripture where
[34:35] it says when um a devil leaves a house,
[34:39] a heart,
[34:40] it it gets all nice and clean and empty.
[34:44] And sometimes we're ah praise the Lord.
[34:46] I feel good. But but the thing is the
[34:49] key is not kicking out the but it's
[34:52] putting back Christ in there.
[34:55] Christ in the heart because he'll come
[34:58] back and he'll come back with seven
[34:59] more. He'll be coming back. Why? Because
[35:02] he says I'm going back to my house. He
[35:06] has rights to our heart.
[35:08] Ever since he deceived Eve, brother
[35:11] Brandham said he has the right to enter
[35:14] human flesh.
[35:16] He said he didn't have brother Brandham
[35:18] or God. He reserved that for himself,
[35:21] the human heart. We are temples. We are
[35:24] vessels for the Lord. And he reserved
[35:27] that right for us until somebody opened
[35:29] the door and now the squatter came in.
[35:33] He says, "Now this is my house. No, this
[35:36] is mine. Now he has the rights.
[35:39] But then when we allow the Lord to come
[35:40] in to clean house and to sit there and
[35:44] say this is my house now
[35:47] this is my home. And when God can sit in
[35:51] the home of our heart, the temple of our
[35:54] heart, watch everything else around us
[35:57] begin to change.
[35:59] Watch the home outside begin to change.
[36:02] Watch the temper begin to go down. Watch
[36:06] the the the easily being scared, the
[36:08] nervousness, the anxiety begin to
[36:11] subside. Sometimes the devil will try to
[36:12] throw it back on you, but then the man
[36:14] of the house is there and he'll
[36:16] constantly be working, constantly be
[36:19] working the house.
[36:22] Isn't that beautiful? That's beautiful
[36:24] that God constantly works in us. So, we
[36:28] can't be in harmony with people without
[36:30] being in harmony with God. We're
[36:34] designed to live from the inside out.
[36:37] Our purpose, our identity, our energy,
[36:40] it's all meant to flow from the union of
[36:43] God. Amen.
[36:45] So, Proverbs 23, what 4:23? Keep your
[36:49] heart with all diligence for out of it
[36:51] are the issues of life.
[36:54] It also says in other other scriptures,
[36:56] it says your is determined from it.
[37:00] Whatever you are in your heart, as a man
[37:02] thinkketh in his heart, so is he. So
[37:05] whatever we think, whatever that's who
[37:07] we are. Now I' I've asked this,
[37:10] who who's thought evil this week?
[37:14] We all have. Praise God. Very truthful.
[37:18] We all have. But that doesn't that
[37:22] doesn't shape us. There there's there's
[37:25] a word that means conception
[37:29] where I it is in in uh Genesis 6 where
[37:33] it says the thoughts the men were evil
[37:36] in those days.
[37:39] It means conception.
[37:41] So so brother Brown he explained that in
[37:43] in um the greatest battle ever fought.
[37:46] He explained that in um spoken word is
[37:48] original seed where where thoughts
[37:50] thoughts can come and go. Right? We can
[37:54] think a bad thought. We can we can get
[37:56] angry for things can come and go. But
[37:58] it's when we allow that thought to sit
[38:02] and then that that sitting there there's
[38:04] a a maturing or a conception happening
[38:08] where you begin to be pregnant by that
[38:11] thought. Right. Amen. Right.
[38:14] because that's how the first idolatry or
[38:16] the first uh uh idolatry came or or the
[38:20] first adultery
[38:22] came from the heart. She thought about
[38:24] it and she just sat on that thought. She
[38:28] continued to think about that thought
[38:30] and as that thought would sit there, it
[38:32] what did it do? It gave birth and it
[38:35] produced her sin with the serpent.
[38:39] So yes, thoughts come and go, brothers.
[38:42] That doesn't define you.
[38:44] Anxieties, they come and go. That
[38:46] doesn't define us. Fears come and go.
[38:50] Doesn't define us. Let that thought come
[38:53] and sit. Then that's when the problem
[38:56] comes. That's when we begin to be formed
[39:00] by the very thoughts, by the very things
[39:02] that we allow in our heart. And as we
[39:05] think, so are we. Amen. So I believe
[39:09] there there is this this battle for our
[39:12] heart and God gave us the free will to
[39:15] say what comes and goes. Allows us to
[39:19] step at the gate, step at that window of
[39:21] our heart and say no, you're not coming
[39:23] in.
[39:24] It doesn't I don't care what the devil
[39:26] says. A lot of times the devil says it
[39:29] doesn't matter what what you do are
[39:31] going to come in. No, you have a right
[39:34] to kick the devil out. Amen. You have a
[39:37] right and you have an authority to say
[39:39] no, I don't want that thought. No, I I
[39:42] don't want that feeling
[39:44] and you can step away from it and and be
[39:47] you do that you can allow the word to
[39:50] come in. And brother Brandon says that
[39:52] word is not only just food but it's a
[39:55] fortification.
[39:57] You begin to fortify your life every
[40:00] word at a time. Ah, that's so beautiful.
[40:02] How you can fortify your own life with
[40:05] words
[40:07] that the very very creative words you
[40:10] put in your life and you are produc
[40:12] producing those words. See, God's words,
[40:17] they're not meant to stay in this Bible.
[40:20] They're not meant to be void. That's why
[40:22] it says my words shall not return to be
[40:25] void.
[40:26] Whatever they are intended to do,
[40:29] they'll reach that heart. they'll reach
[40:31] that person and it will produce
[40:34] and it will prosper with a thing. So
[40:38] every word, every promise that God has
[40:41] given us, you take it to your heart.
[40:43] Amen.
[40:45] Put it in the the center of your heart.
[40:48] You put Christ in the center of your
[40:50] heart and watch. Well man, I I can't
[40:52] can't this habit. I I can't I can't stop
[40:56] this. I I keep getting angry. This
[40:58] happens. Put the word in your heart.
[41:01] Allow those principles to not only be a
[41:04] knowledge in your mind, but begin to a
[41:08] life.
[41:09] And watch what happens.
[41:12] So, we can have fellowship, but we know
[41:14] it's it's going to be a a broken
[41:16] fellowship. We can have all of these
[41:19] things, but we know it's it's not going
[41:20] to be right. It's it's not because of a
[41:23] sweet spirit around us that makes a good
[41:26] fellowship. It doesn't govern the
[41:28] situation, but it's in the inddwelling
[41:31] spirit that governs you no matter what
[41:33] the situation is. So, we can come to
[41:37] church, we can feel a good spirit, but
[41:40] God doesn't want that because when you
[41:42] go out, the spirit, there's going to be
[41:44] different kinds of spirits, but when you
[41:46] have the indwelling spirit, it doesn't
[41:48] matter what the situation is around you.
[41:51] It doesn't matter what's around you.
[41:53] It's what's within you.
[41:56] Brother Brandham, he says in the message
[41:59] um oneness in in 58 he says paragraph 57
[42:02] he says see two spirits their um see the
[42:06] two spirits their motives objective.
[42:10] Watch how it is. Watch their works.
[42:12] Watch their fruits. Then you can see
[42:15] what spirit is on you. You are motivated
[42:18] by a spirit. If you have no spirit
[42:21] you're dead. And if you have a spirit,
[42:24] it motivates your life.
[42:27] You know, I um I realized that that's
[42:30] that's God's his that's how God works.
[42:35] That God he he doesn't want to rule this
[42:38] earth with his spirit. He wants hands
[42:42] and feet on the ground.
[42:44] So, so there's there's almost this law.
[42:47] If you look in the whole Bible, I I
[42:49] don't really want to go too much, but
[42:51] there's a law where a spirit is almost
[42:54] illegal in this place,
[42:56] the the spirits are meant to live in
[43:00] you. But then now you have these
[43:02] spirits, these fallen angels, these
[43:05] demons, Satan, whatever you want to call
[43:07] it, that are around the world, the
[43:11] prince of the power of the earth trying
[43:13] to dwell within a home. cuz they got
[43:17] kicked out of their home. They got
[43:20] kicked out in heaven. So now they're
[43:23] living illegally in this place looking
[43:26] for a home to go over.
[43:30] Brother Benham says God he his spirit
[43:32] will fill the whole earth but it cannot
[43:34] work until it operates through somebody.
[43:38] So spirits there, brother Benham says
[43:40] they're almost harmless if they don't
[43:42] have a body to work in.
[43:46] So we have to look within ourselves and
[43:48] see what
[43:50] what what fruits do I have?
[43:53] What life do I have? And it will show
[43:57] what spirit we have. We see it in the
[43:59] world now with hatred, with with with
[44:02] murder and all of that. We see what kind
[44:04] of spirit is in them.
[44:08] But the children of God, the bride,
[44:10] they're moving with love. They're moving
[44:13] with faith. They're moving. Doesn't
[44:16] matter if we fall today or we fall
[44:18] tomorrow, we get back up because within
[44:20] us, there's a man in the house.
[44:23] Sometimes, brothers, the roof fails.
[44:27] Sometimes there's a leak. Sometimes a
[44:30] pipe bursts. Sometimes something goes
[44:33] wrong. The man of the house has to fix
[44:35] it. He goes and he works on this person.
[44:38] Amen. I love that because we this body
[44:42] that we have today is just a tent. Just
[44:45] like like uh with the children of Israel
[44:47] and Moses, they were in tents. They
[44:49] never built homes. Brother Brandham says
[44:52] they every single day they had to see
[44:54] where the cloud or the pillar of fire
[44:56] was. Didn't matter. It was 1:00 in the
[44:59] morning. If it began to move, that tent
[45:02] had to go down and go with it. That's
[45:05] where we're at today.
[45:07] We're living in a tent. This body that
[45:10] we have is nothing but a tent. But one
[45:12] of these days, we have a body waiting.
[45:16] One of these days, step into a body that
[45:19] will never fall, never be corrupted.
[45:22] Amen.
[45:24] So,
[45:25] so they they fell and and all of those
[45:28] things happened. And um in in Matthew 22
[45:32] 22 uh verse 35 and to 39
[45:37] here uh a lawyer asks Jesus a question
[45:43] and he says then one of them said which
[45:46] was a lawyer and asked him a question
[45:48] tempting him saying master what is the
[45:50] greatest commandment in the law. Jesus
[45:53] says, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[45:55] with all of thy heart, and with all of
[45:57] thy soul, with all of thy mind. This is
[46:00] the first and great commandment."
[46:03] Now, Jesus, he he quoted Deuteronomy, I
[46:08] believe, out of all scriptures, he
[46:11] quoted Deuteronomy. And here he's
[46:13] quoting Deuteronomy 6 uh uh 5-9 where it
[46:19] says, "Thou shalt love the Lord God with
[46:21] all of thy heart, with all of thy soul,
[46:23] and all of thy might."
[46:26] And here it's showing that that how it
[46:29] all starts our Christianity, our laws
[46:32] are following rules, everything. If you
[46:35] want to talk about following the message
[46:38] or following church and all these
[46:41] things, it all starts with this.
[46:44] This is the core. This is brother Rand
[46:48] Jesus says that all of the laws hang on
[46:50] these two.
[46:52] You shall love the Lord with all of your
[46:54] heart, with all of your your mind, with
[46:58] all of your soul.
[47:00] So out of this it flow, everything flows
[47:03] out.
[47:05] from the closest relationships all the
[47:08] way to the distant relationships. First,
[47:10] it flows out of the heart. First, the
[47:14] Lord with all of your heart, your soul,
[47:16] and your mind.
[47:18] Then,
[47:20] if you go to uh Deuteronomy 5 6:5, it
[47:23] says
[47:25] or uh 66, it says, "And these words
[47:29] which I command thee this day that uh
[47:32] shall be in thy heart." And look at how
[47:34] it flows out. So first it says it's in
[47:36] your heart. And thou shalt teach them
[47:39] diligently unto their children. Thou
[47:42] shalt talk with them that um them that
[47:44] sit in thine house. And when thy walkest
[47:47] by the way, and when thou liest down,
[47:49] and when thy rises rise up, thou shalt
[47:53] bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and
[47:55] thou shalt be in the frontlets between
[47:56] thine eyes. and thou shalt write them
[47:58] upon the post of thy house and upon and
[48:01] on thy gates. What is it first? Love him
[48:05] with all of your heart. Then he says,
[48:08] put it in your heart. Then teach them.
[48:12] Teach them to your children. When you're
[48:14] out and about, let it show. When when
[48:18] you're in front of your house, when
[48:19] you're at work, you're doing it flows
[48:21] from within out.
[48:25] That's how it starts.
[48:28] here going back on on uh Matthew 22:39.
[48:31] It says, "And the second is like unto
[48:33] it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[48:35] thyself."
[48:37] Now,
[48:39] this is an amazing thing because we can
[48:40] say, "Man, um, love your neighbor. Love
[48:42] your neighbor. Love your neighbor." But
[48:43] we forget about thyself, right, man? We
[48:47] think our ourselves as cockroaches, yet
[48:50] we we need to love our neighbor.
[48:53] So first the Bible says love the Lord
[48:55] with all of your heart. That's the first
[48:58] principle. And when you love the Lord
[49:01] there there's there begins to be an
[49:03] appreciation about yourself.
[49:06] See the standard of loving your neighbor
[49:08] is loving yourself first.
[49:11] So so young people if I'd like to direct
[49:16] my focus to you is h how love somebody
[49:20] without first
[49:22] If we want to get married, if anything
[49:24] like that, how can we build
[49:26] relationships with friends if we don't
[49:28] love ourselves first?
[49:31] So first this garden has to be kept up.
[49:35] First we have to guard this heart. We
[49:39] have to make sure we love the Lord with
[49:40] all of our heart because we don't ever
[49:42] want to go into a reling
[49:47] allinone.
[49:49] Adam wasn't lacking. He was allinone.
[49:52] And when you go into relationships, when
[49:54] you go into friendships, we don't go
[49:56] lacking because what happens? We begin
[49:59] to right when we get relationship, we
[50:01] take. Yes. They they have what I need.
[50:05] So if that person comes, they're already
[50:07] deficient
[50:09] of their love because they're already
[50:11] giving and you're taking. Amen. So there
[50:15] has to be a fullness a overflowing
[50:18] spring out of your own heart to where
[50:21] the when there becomes a desire to have
[50:23] friends to do certain things there is
[50:25] not a sense of I'm lacking. I need this.
[50:28] I I want this. I'm lonely but I'm going
[50:30] over there to give. I'm giving life. I'm
[50:35] I'm giving everything that I have
[50:37] because because I'm full.
[50:40] That's what Jesus was. The amazing thing
[50:43] when Jesus came, the Bible says he was
[50:46] despised and he was rejected. That means
[50:48] he had no fellowship. Nobody wanted him.
[50:52] There's books and there's people that
[50:53] have said that would create scenarios
[50:56] of, man, what if Jesus did have a
[50:58] girlfriend? What if she he did have a
[51:00] wife and children and family and all of
[51:03] those things? And and and they think
[51:05] about this like, oh man, poor guy, he
[51:06] was so lonely. But brothers, he had his
[51:09] pride within him.
[51:11] He wasn't lonely. He had his bride in
[51:14] him. He had a purpose. And as as he was
[51:18] a man walking life, he was working
[51:21] towards that goal so that he could
[51:23] provide everything for his wife. So that
[51:26] he could provide every
[51:29] a man in a mission. Amen. Yes. Brother
[51:33] said when he was there at the garden of
[51:35] Gethsemane that that God literally his
[51:40] from him.
[51:42] That's the hardest thing. It wasn't a
[51:43] physical death that God the the hardest
[51:45] thing is when God separates himself from
[51:48] you and he had to do it because he had
[51:50] to die like a sinner.
[51:52] So there he separated from God and and
[51:55] saying Lord let it be your will. If you
[51:59] can let this cup pass from let it be
[52:01] your will. Brother Brandham says God
[52:04] looked down and Jesus saw his bride in
[52:08] him too. Why? Cuz he was carrying her.
[52:11] Amen. He was carrying all of her sins.
[52:14] He was he was the protector of the
[52:17] house. He was making sure when she comes
[52:21] that everything was
[52:24] you know you know that's what I love
[52:25] about Jesus. He he before he was gonna
[52:27] get married, he says, "Hold on. I
[52:29] prepare a place first." Yes. What? He
[52:31] was ready. He was a man prepared. He He
[52:36] was a man ready to give everything to
[52:39] his bride.
[52:41] Brothers and sisters, that's how we
[52:43] should stand today
[52:45] in everything we do. We should be
[52:50] singular. meaning not wanting anything
[52:55] but have everything whole in one.
[52:58] Whether you've been we've been married
[53:00] for for five years or or 50 years have
[53:04] to be that I have to be that. Amen. My
[53:07] my family depends on it. My work space
[53:10] depends on it. My friends depend on it.
[53:12] This world depends on the bride.
[53:16] We are the ones to give out life. We are
[53:18] the ones that show them that there is a
[53:21] better way. How? By the life that we
[53:23] live. Amen. Let's stand to our feet.
[53:27] That's the best thing that we could do.
[53:29] You know Jesus, he died.
[53:32] They they cried for him, but he sent
[53:35] back his Holy Spirit and and allowed his
[53:38] spirit because his desire was Lord, let
[53:41] them that that I be in them, them in me,
[53:45] and you in me, Lord, and I in you. That
[53:48] was his desire. And then the day of
[53:50] Pentecost, it says that he divided, he
[53:53] separated himself and went on the
[53:55] people. And he says in in one message,
[53:58] I'm I'm just going to paraphrase, but
[54:00] you can look it up or you can ask me
[54:02] later if you want it, but where he says
[54:05] that at that time Paul and Peter never
[54:07] saw each other, but they received the
[54:10] same exact experience and they were
[54:13] fellowshipped and in union with each
[54:15] other
[54:16] without even seeing each other. Why? Now
[54:19] we are all together one.
[54:22] Doesn't matter what we are, who we are.
[54:27] what we do. We are all one in Christ.
[54:31] That's my desire. That that's my earnest
[54:33] desire that Lord Lord let me be a
[54:38] complete and good temple for you Lord so
[54:43] that anybody that comes around me
[54:45] anything that I do that you may be
[54:48] produced. That's all I want.
[54:53] Brother Andrew, let us bow our heads.
[54:57] Heavenly Father,
[55:00] Lord, I truly believe that that's every
[55:02] single one of your children's desire is
[55:05] to be closer, to have a greater
[55:07] relationship with you. Because in being
[55:10] selfish and saying, "Lord, all I want is
[55:12] you, Father. I don't want anything."
[55:14] That's the most selfless thing we can do
[55:17] because then it it it produces a good
[55:21] life for others. It produces love.
[55:25] It produces gentleness. It produces the
[55:28] stature of man. It produces the fruits
[55:30] of the spirit. It produces you in us.
[55:35] Father, we just ask Lord
[55:38] we're wecome selfish just for a second
[55:40] and say, Lord, all I want is you.
[55:43] I don't want any, Lord. Maybe there's
[55:46] things um pending in my life. There's
[55:49] things that are are waiting for my
[55:50] answer. But Lord, all I want is you at
[55:52] this moment.
[55:54] And in doing that, in seeking you,
[55:56] seeking the kingdom, everything else
[55:58] will be added. Lord,
[56:00] we ask that you bless each and every
[56:02] person here. The name of the Lord Jesus
[56:04] Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. Amen.
