[0:00] ezra chapter 9 verses
[0:03] 5 to 9 and at the evening sacrifice
[0:07] i arose up from my heaviness and having
[0:10] rent my garment
[0:11] in my mantle i fell upon my knees and
[0:14] spread out my hands unto the lord my god
[0:16] and said o my god i am ashamed and blush
[0:20] to lift up my face to thee my god
[0:22] for our iniquities are increased over
[0:24] our head and our trespasses grown up
[0:26] unto the heavens
[0:27] since the days of our fathers have we
[0:29] been in great trespass unto this day
[0:31] and for our iniquities have we our kings
[0:33] and our priests been delivered into the
[0:35] hand of the kings of the lands
[0:37] to the sword to captivity and to a spoil
[0:40] and to confusion of face
[0:41] as it is this day and now for little
[0:44] space grace have been showed from the
[0:46] lord our god to leave us a remnant to
[0:48] escape
[0:49] and to give us a nail in his holy place
[0:52] that our god may lighten our eyes and
[0:53] give us a little revive and in our
[0:55] bondage
[0:56] for we were bond men yet our god hath
[0:58] not forsaken us in our bondage
[1:00] but hath extended mercy unto us in the
[1:02] sight of the kings of persia
[1:05] to give us a reviving to set up the
[1:07] house of our god
[1:08] and to repair the desolations thereof
[1:11] they give us a wall in judah
[1:13] and in jerusalem amen you can be seated
[1:18] our thought this morning is a a place to
[1:21] start fresh
[1:23] and it kind of carries it with the idea
[1:27] of stopping and starting over again
[1:31] but that's uh that's the title that we
[1:34] have as a place to start fresh
[1:36] and the lord had been dealing with my
[1:38] heart on this particular
[1:40] subject and then i received a notice
[1:43] thanks to the almighty google that
[1:46] yesterday was the first day of spring
[1:49] and it it just kind of helped things
[1:52] form in my mind and just see how these
[1:54] things were all
[1:55] the timing was very uh pertinent to
[1:58] where we are now
[1:59] the uh it being the first day of spring
[2:02] that you can just even ponder the
[2:03] different elements of spring now that
[2:05] it's officially
[2:06] at least in terms of the calendar spring
[2:08] time
[2:09] and when we think of springtime we think
[2:11] of ideas of something being reborn or
[2:13] springing forth
[2:15] we think of renewal and regeneration we
[2:18] think of it in terms of the passover
[2:19] this time of year we think of
[2:22] resurrection or exodus or regrowth
[2:25] and literally what is happening is the
[2:27] earth begins to tilt and its access
[2:29] to where the the northern hemisphere is
[2:31] getting a little bit closer to the sun
[2:33] and
[2:33] snow is melting and the earth is warming
[2:35] up and daylight increases
[2:37] and as it warms this causes new life to
[2:40] spring up
[2:41] it causes new growth it causes plants to
[2:44] to grow and that's why
[2:45] they give it this time of year give it
[2:47] this name it means to
[2:48] to spring forth or to spring up in job
[2:51] chapter 38 verse 27
[2:53] says to satisfy the desolate and waste
[2:56] ground
[2:57] and to cause the bud of the tender herb
[2:59] to spring
[3:00] forth and that's what the name spring uh
[3:03] when we use this time springtime or to
[3:05] spring forth it's talking about things
[3:07] budding to spring forth to sprout or to
[3:09] grow up
[3:10] and this is what time of year when new
[3:12] life is appearing things are greening
[3:14] things are
[3:15] blooming things are flowering and so
[3:18] that's why
[3:18] springtime is often referred to as a
[3:21] time of renewal or
[3:22] gives a feeling of a fresh start if
[3:24] things are just being born and
[3:26] uh having never experienced life before
[3:29] having never butted
[3:30] we think in terms of innocence and a new
[3:32] beginning
[3:33] and this is this is kind of what the
[3:35] springtime even means to us
[3:37] as people we talk about doing some
[3:39] spring cleaning
[3:40] and it's like starting all over with our
[3:42] house and getting things clean doing
[3:43] things that it should have been done for
[3:44] a long time or maybe doing things
[3:46] we had never done before and the same
[3:50] image is painted in isaiah chapter 43
[3:53] verses 18 to 19 where it says remember
[3:56] ye not the former things
[3:58] neither consider the things of old
[4:00] behold
[4:01] i this is god now i will do a
[4:04] new thing now it shall spring forth
[4:08] and there's a there's a a connection
[4:10] with what we were ministering last time
[4:12] in terms of suddenly
[4:14] and why not now and how that we ought to
[4:16] believe that god can in a moment
[4:18] change something and how that if you've
[4:21] been sick your entire life you still
[4:23] should have the belief in faith that
[4:24] suddenly
[4:25] you can be healed if someone a loved one
[4:28] has not been saved and you've been
[4:30] telling this truth for decades you still
[4:32] should have a faith to believe
[4:34] that suddenly everything changes and so
[4:36] you have the same image
[4:38] in mind when he says i will do a new
[4:40] thing now it shall
[4:42] spring forth there's a suddenness to it
[4:45] and
[4:45] there is such a suddenness and an
[4:47] unexpectation to it he says shall ye not
[4:49] know it in other words
[4:50] if i do a new thing and it springs forth
[4:53] you're going to see it
[4:54] it's going to even maybe be startling to
[4:56] you because he says i will even make a
[4:58] way in the wilderness so there's gonna
[4:59] be a
[5:00] path made where it was desolate where
[5:02] there should not be a way where there
[5:04] would not be a traveled path
[5:06] he's saying i'm going to make a way in
[5:07] the wilderness and
[5:09] rivers in the desert and we ought not to
[5:12] let our experience here in phoenix
[5:14] defeat that faith that there are rivers
[5:16] there can be
[5:17] rivers in the desert there can be
[5:19] something streaming forth and
[5:21] a place that's desolate and dry and
[5:23] there's been
[5:24] no water god's gonna say i'm gonna do
[5:26] something and you say well this is odd
[5:29] there shouldn't be a river here this is
[5:30] a place that's very dry this is a
[5:32] a place which is not characterized uh as
[5:35] desert it wouldn't even be like us where
[5:37] we have canals and washes and we would
[5:39] expect maybe at some time there'd be
[5:41] water in it
[5:42] he said this is a wasteland this is a
[5:44] desert of sand but yet god gonna
[5:46] make a way where there's rivers and
[5:48] streams in the desert
[5:50] and so in this uh the title we're giving
[5:52] it a place to start fresh
[5:54] it's it's a place to start anew to begin
[5:57] again
[5:58] it's a place to start over and i'll be
[6:01] very it's gonna be very simple very
[6:05] and very direct and and i know these
[6:08] things are foundational
[6:09] but i believe they ought to be a part of
[6:11] our experience as individuals
[6:13] so it should it could serve just to
[6:15] refresh some of us in the experience
[6:16] that we had
[6:18] and that we've been enjoying and then
[6:20] also it would be challenging to our
[6:22] young people
[6:23] uh and to those who god is just now
[6:25] dealing with
[6:26] and they're being brought to the light
[6:27] of the truth and god is dealing with
[6:29] their hearts so it's very
[6:30] foundational and fundamental in terms of
[6:32] salvation and then i believe it's also
[6:35] instructive to us as the body that we
[6:39] as as we begin as a church we want
[6:41] certain things to be a part of our
[6:42] fabric
[6:43] we want to identify certain things that
[6:45] are in our dna and what we are as a body
[6:47] and i believe this fits very well with
[6:50] that
[6:51] and so as job says and it speaks of
[6:54] something springing forth and then god
[6:56] saying i will do a new thing
[6:58] now it shall spring forth and even what
[7:00] we'll come to here in a moment
[7:02] as we've read in ezra the scriptures are
[7:04] touching on something that is deep
[7:05] within
[7:06] all of our hearts it's something that's
[7:09] part of the human condition
[7:11] and that's the allure or the power that
[7:14] we believe
[7:14] a fresh start has and i think that all
[7:18] of us can relate to this regardless of
[7:20] where we are
[7:21] in terms of our life experience or what
[7:23] our hobbies are our passions are what
[7:25] our level of cleanliness is or what our
[7:27] endeavors may be
[7:28] there's something about beginning again
[7:30] and starting over that holds a strong
[7:32] attraction to us
[7:34] and it's a psychological phenomena and
[7:36] that it exists within our minds
[7:38] that causes us or motivates people to
[7:41] begin to do something
[7:43] that where there is a an opportunity to
[7:46] start over or something happens
[7:49] and you you view this as your chance to
[7:51] begin afresh
[7:53] and it's it's a psychological feeling
[7:55] where now i feel free and i have the
[7:57] liberty to do something that i otherwise
[8:00] wouldn't have done before or right now i
[8:02] feel that i have this liberty or i have
[8:04] a starting point i have a place from
[8:05] which i can begin
[8:07] and it's a way that we just fill in our
[8:08] minds because it's not that somebody
[8:11] you know the starting pistol fired or
[8:13] the light turned green it's like now is
[8:14] your chance
[8:15] it's just something happens and it
[8:17] becomes this mark in our minds like
[8:19] now's my chance to start again and so a
[8:22] start is initiated after what the
[8:24] psychologist would call or the academics
[8:26] would call a temporal
[8:27] landmark so there's some landmark that's
[8:30] established in your mind and once it's
[8:32] established that represents to you
[8:34] the point of departure the the point of
[8:37] demarcation where from this point on
[8:39] things are going to be different and it
[8:41] becomes a place where you say right now
[8:43] is a new beginning and you divide things
[8:46] from
[8:46] that moment from this point on things
[8:49] are different anything that happened
[8:50] before
[8:51] well that's not in the consideration
[8:52] that's not in the picture
[8:54] i'm starting from this point and i'm
[8:56] going forward
[8:57] and what happens is again this is kind
[8:59] of psychological this is within our
[9:01] thinking and how we feel within our
[9:02] emotions
[9:03] it creates a clean slate in our mind
[9:06] like we don't have to consider
[9:07] decades of failure we don't have to
[9:09] consider years of bad habits so we don't
[9:12] have to consider
[9:13] just all the poor decisions that we've
[9:15] made over the last while we can say
[9:17] from this point on right now i'm
[9:18] starting all over and
[9:20] everything else in my mind i'm going to
[9:21] erase i'm not going to hold it on my
[9:23] account it's starting clean
[9:25] and it's a clean slate from this moment
[9:27] forward
[9:28] and temporal landmarks can be everything
[9:30] from the first day of spring
[9:32] like now that's the first day of spring
[9:34] i'm going to be sure to vacuum
[9:36] uh a room every day or now that it's the
[9:38] first day of spring i'm going to start
[9:39] getting my car washed on saturdays
[9:41] and you use this this day march 20th
[9:44] 2021 is the day which i
[9:45] began to do something and it's really
[9:48] just a
[9:49] temporal landmark there's nothing more
[9:51] really anything significant about it
[9:53] other than
[9:53] it's something that anchors in your mind
[9:55] and becomes a point of reference
[9:58] it can even be a birthday when you turn
[10:01] a certain age and you say from this
[10:02] point on
[10:03] it could be the beginning of a new
[10:04] school semester it could be the start of
[10:06] a new job there's all these
[10:08] different ways that we could have a
[10:09] landmark that becomes the
[10:11] the the foundation from which we're
[10:13] beginning something
[10:15] what we probably do the most often is we
[10:17] look at new year's
[10:18] a day as that point of this temporal
[10:20] landmark we're going to start things
[10:22] we're going to do things
[10:23] and just to use as this as an example uh
[10:27] so that you understand kind of where
[10:29] maybe my psychology is you'd always
[10:31] take the position well brother aaron
[10:33] thanks for letting us know how you think
[10:35] and uh it may be beneficial to you just
[10:37] to know where i'm coming from
[10:39] but they've done some research on this
[10:41] and one particular study found that if
[10:42] you're approaching a new decade in
[10:44] chronological age
[10:46] in other words if you're 39 turning 40
[10:48] 29 turning 30
[10:49] yadda yadda yadda 69 turning 70 if
[10:52] you're approaching a new decade it
[10:53] causes people to begin to search their
[10:55] life for purpose
[10:57] and so i'm 39 years old i'm turning 40.
[10:59] now that i'm turning 40
[11:01] you know what have i done in these 40
[11:02] years and what have i accomplished and
[11:05] and is your 59 turning 60 we realize
[11:07] that these birthdays are the ones that
[11:09] loom very large when someone turns 40
[11:11] it's what it lordy lordy look who's 40
[11:14] and and you have everything's black on
[11:16] that day and then when they're turning
[11:17] 50
[11:18] um there's it's something even in our
[11:20] minds about these zeros
[11:22] at the beginning of a new decade that
[11:24] create significant birthdays and they
[11:26] find that the people who are the nine
[11:27] enders 39
[11:28] 49 59 69 79 that they begin to ask
[11:32] themselves
[11:32] what have i done with my life and what
[11:34] have i accomplished and
[11:36] now that i'm starting a new decade it
[11:38] causes a period of reflection
[11:39] and consideration about where they are
[11:41] and what they've done
[11:43] and so what happens in this
[11:45] soul-searching the consequence of this
[11:47] looking within themselves and trying to
[11:48] figure out what have i done what have i
[11:50] accomplished
[11:51] it it inspires people to engage in
[11:54] meaningful activity or purpose giving or
[11:57] meaning seeking behaviors
[11:59] where i'm 39 years old i haven't done
[12:02] anything i'm going to run a marathon
[12:04] or i'm 49 years old and and and i have
[12:07] nothing to show for it so i'm gonna i'm
[12:09] gonna climb mount everest and people
[12:11] want to do something i want to start
[12:13] something i'm gonna start saving i'm
[12:14] gonna start doing i'm gonna start a
[12:16] hobby i'm gonna do this
[12:17] because they're they use this turning of
[12:19] age this new decade
[12:21] as a temporal landmark to start again
[12:23] and to do something
[12:24] an example that this one study used and
[12:26] they were looking at these different
[12:28] marathons so i didn't just kind of
[12:30] arbitrarily pull that out of a
[12:31] out of the ether but it says among 500
[12:34] first-time marathon runners the nine
[12:36] enders people 29
[12:38] 39 49 represented over represented by
[12:41] 48 percent compared with age groups
[12:44] ending in a different digit
[12:46] so in a of 500 first-time marathon
[12:50] runners
[12:50] almost half of them were either 29 39
[12:54] 49 59 69 79 89 who maybe 99
[12:58] who give me 109 and it's their first
[13:01] time running the marathon and what the
[13:03] researchers are saying is that
[13:04] because they're at that nine ender
[13:06] because they're at the threshold of
[13:08] another decade
[13:09] they're looking within themselves of
[13:11] this landmark that's approaching and
[13:12] they want to know have i done something
[13:14] have i accomplished something
[13:15] and it actually inspires people to for
[13:17] the first time to run a marathon
[13:19] have any of you ever been inspired to
[13:21] run a marathon
[13:23] i haven't checked with me when i'm
[13:24] turning 49 things may be a little bit
[13:26] different
[13:27] i don't even like to run errands let
[13:29] alone run a marathon
[13:31] and so i couldn't imagine myself running
[13:32] but yet people can be motivated and
[13:35] inspired oh
[13:36] uh this is this is something that i want
[13:38] to do and accomplish and it's all part
[13:40] of this thing in our minds
[13:42] this mechanism where we're looking for a
[13:45] fresh start
[13:47] and so this uh this psychology this way
[13:49] that our minds works it draws us to
[13:52] so now a fresh start a temporal landmark
[13:55] this
[13:56] turning of a new decade it creates or it
[13:58] draws us to the idea
[13:59] of a new beginning and if somebody said
[14:03] hey i'm going to give you a chance to
[14:04] start over in something
[14:05] here's your credit score we're going to
[14:07] let you start all over
[14:09] uh there's an alert to that there's an
[14:10] attraction to it there's a
[14:12] strong attraction to a fresh start and
[14:13] what it does is in our minds when we're
[14:16] drawn to this it gives us we're drawn to
[14:18] these new beginnings and these fresh
[14:20] starts
[14:20] to hope for something that things will
[14:23] be different this time it
[14:24] we can change something we can have
[14:26] something better
[14:28] and that this is gonna be for our good
[14:31] this is an
[14:31] opportunity for us to to excel and to
[14:34] achieve
[14:35] and so we've all used the language of
[14:37] starting tomorrow
[14:40] oh nobody here has okay think of your
[14:42] neighbor
[14:43] all right i got a better idea from this
[14:44] point on let's think of that person you
[14:47] know the one we're talking about
[14:48] and if and if uh and if you agree just
[14:50] go um yep
[14:51] amen that's right oh yeah
[14:54] exactly brother aaron or as my brother
[14:57] says all the time
[14:58] sure and i'm like is that good is that
[15:00] bad i mean
[15:01] they say something wrong sure right
[15:03] aaron but
[15:05] just so just think about somebody else
[15:06] if you need to but we say often
[15:09] let's start tomorrow starting tomorrow
[15:12] we're going to begin again starting to
[15:13] work we're going to start this starting
[15:15] tomorrow we're going to
[15:16] do this as a family starting tomorrow
[15:18] we're going to begin home school at 8
[15:19] o'clock in the morning
[15:21] starting tomorrow and if it doesn't
[15:23] start at 8 o'clock in the morning you
[15:24] know what we'll do it next week
[15:26] right because we wanna there's we're
[15:28] looking for this point where we can
[15:29] begin
[15:30] and get into it and go and then we when
[15:32] we begin we say
[15:33] this time it's gonna be different
[15:36] right this time i'm actually going to
[15:39] refuse to eat fried foods this time
[15:41] i'm going to do this time i'm going to
[15:43] cut out diet drinks or sodas or whatever
[15:45] this time it's going to be different
[15:46] and we're making these promises to
[15:48] ourselves and why is it different this
[15:50] time because
[15:50] this is now oh that that that's in the
[15:54] past that was another time that doesn't
[15:55] apply
[15:56] and we can feel and things that have a
[15:58] lot more to do than just
[15:59] a diet and things like that but even
[16:02] very significant events happen in your
[16:04] lives and commitments we say
[16:05] this is i have a new lease on life i i
[16:09] was in bondage and this was happening
[16:10] and that was happening everything was
[16:11] going the wrong way but something
[16:13] happened and by these turns of events
[16:15] i feel like i have some breathing room i
[16:17] have a new lease on life
[16:18] and people will actually come to places
[16:20] in their lives where they feel i'm
[16:21] starting over
[16:23] i'm able to start from scratch
[16:24] everything that was hanging on to me
[16:26] everything that was tearing us down
[16:27] everything that was burning us
[16:28] we've somehow been able to get past it
[16:30] and i and i'm breathing again
[16:32] and i feel free and i feel liberty and
[16:34] you think now is a point now is a time
[16:37] where things can be different and we're
[16:38] going to go forward
[16:40] and so it's a it's a mindset
[16:43] and it's a mindset that we can have in
[16:46] different
[16:46] uh situations or scenarios or maybe
[16:49] there's a
[16:50] a couple and and they have been courting
[16:53] from some
[16:53] for some time and they love one another
[16:56] and they're dating and
[16:57] maybe the relationship has been rocky
[16:59] and maybe there's some things may
[17:01] be habits or behaviors or things that
[17:04] don't seem to be right or the
[17:05] relationships are always trying to work
[17:07] through something
[17:08] and they get engaged and in their minds
[17:10] that when we get married
[17:12] things will be different i'm not trying
[17:15] to cast dispersion or doubt on that
[17:16] whole concept i'm with you i support you
[17:19] newlyweds the newly engaged i believe
[17:21] things can be different
[17:22] suddenly he's very patient and kind
[17:25] as soon as the ring went on his finger
[17:28] but we we often think that way that now
[17:31] once we get married things are going to
[17:33] be different things will change there'll
[17:35] be a change of behavior and
[17:37] and he won't be away for two weeks at
[17:39] the world of warcraft convention in
[17:40] chicago
[17:41] uh once we get married things are going
[17:43] to change and and he won't have a call
[17:44] of duty basement or something
[17:46] things are going to be different and so
[17:47] there's this idea that once we cross a
[17:50] threshold once we do something things
[17:51] will change
[17:52] and then we could say even in that
[17:54] scenario of a newly married couple
[17:56] that well once we get a house once we
[17:58] get a house things will change
[18:00] or once he once this happens and once
[18:02] that happened and we have this way of
[18:04] thinking that there's these events that
[18:06] are going to happen they're going to
[18:07] afford us another opportunity to start
[18:10] all over again
[18:11] does that sound familiar right those
[18:13] people we're talking about
[18:14] you know that those neighbors those
[18:16] newly married neighbors
[18:18] in the apartment next door to us talking
[18:19] about the house they're going to buy and
[18:20] how everything's going to be different
[18:21] once they get new house that's who we're
[18:23] talking about so just relax
[18:25] having fun this morning
[18:30] it could be with the new job once i get
[18:31] a new job once i get a raise my
[18:33] spending habits are going to be
[18:34] different and we're going to do things
[18:36] differently and
[18:37] i'm going to start once i get into job
[18:39] i'll start paying tithes and once i get
[18:40] into job i'll start coming to church
[18:42] and we make these promises why because
[18:44] the fresh start in the new beginning
[18:46] is huge to us in our minds something
[18:49] very big psychologically
[18:51] and because it's big we cut we can enter
[18:54] into this mode of continually searching
[18:57] for that new beginning we're always
[19:00] looking for that clean slate we're
[19:02] trying to figure out a way to start all
[19:04] over again
[19:05] and there's a lot of different examples
[19:07] that i can give where some of us who are
[19:08] maybe
[19:09] obsessive-compulsive there's certain
[19:11] things that we're just not happy to
[19:13] start all over with we just need to
[19:15] trash it
[19:16] dump it forget about it delete it and
[19:18] start all over from scratch
[19:19] because there's a psychology to this the
[19:22] way that we think and
[19:23] because we're wanting this fresh start
[19:26] this new lease on life
[19:27] it can cause a cycle of tomorrow it's
[19:30] going to be different
[19:32] and then things unwinding again and then
[19:34] the search is on and you're longing and
[19:35] it creates this continual cycle
[19:37] of wanting a place to start over again
[19:41] it's a phrase that's used in alexander
[19:43] pope's essay an essay on man
[19:46] he uses the phrase hope springs eternal
[19:50] and it's become this uh proverb within
[19:53] a humanity not a scripture but an
[19:56] observation of
[19:57] man where hope springs eternal that
[20:00] within the nature of man
[20:01] he's always wanting to find fresh cause
[20:04] for optimism
[20:06] i've got a new reason to believe this
[20:08] time i got a new reason to hope hope
[20:11] springs eternal
[20:12] there's something within us that keeps
[20:14] us hoping regardless of the odds
[20:16] regardless of the circumstances
[20:18] everything could be crashing and falling
[20:20] apart and
[20:21] horrible and the decisions be bad and
[20:23] the health be bad but
[20:24] the next day the first day of spring we
[20:28] can say to ourselves you know what
[20:29] from this point on and we can give
[20:32] ourselves fresh cause to be optimistic
[20:34] fresh cause to be positive why because
[20:36] there's something within us
[20:37] where hope springs eternal that there's
[20:40] always a rebirth of our expectation a
[20:42] rebirth of a hope
[20:43] this time it's gonna be different and
[20:44] this longing drives us
[20:47] in every human heart there's a longing
[20:48] for a new beginning
[20:50] in every human heart there's a longing
[20:51] for a fresh start
[20:53] and this fresh start it's a solid place
[20:56] it's a place where you can get your
[20:57] footing
[20:59] and you can spring forward from this is
[21:02] what we think about when we think a new
[21:03] beginning or a fresh start when we talk
[21:05] about hope springs eternal and all these
[21:07] mechanisms in our mind
[21:08] it's a place of solid footing where he's
[21:10] like you know what from here i feel like
[21:11] i can do it
[21:13] from this place right here i feel like i
[21:15] can make a change from this place right
[21:17] here
[21:17] i feel like from this moment on things
[21:19] can be different
[21:21] are we satisfied with the foundation
[21:23] anybody good we can move on
[21:25] let's look at ezra chapter nine as we
[21:28] read this before i'd like to read it
[21:29] again
[21:31] that's my foundation now i would like to
[21:35] dig into the scriptures on this subject
[21:40] and cover hopefully
[21:44] some very relevant ground for you
[21:47] or at least for our neighbors in the
[21:48] apartment next door
[21:50] if they'd be so inclined to stream this
[21:53] ezra chapter 9 verse 5
[21:55] and at the evening sacrifice this is the
[21:57] type of christ
[21:59] i arose up from my heaviness here's this
[22:01] burden this longing within his heart and
[22:02] having rent my garment and my mantle i
[22:04] fell upon my knees and spread out my
[22:06] hands and to the lord my god
[22:08] and this is a state of repentance this
[22:11] is a state
[22:12] of reflection and you could tell by what
[22:14] he begins to say next he's saying
[22:16] look at my past look at our past his own
[22:18] culpability there's no
[22:19] excuses he says and i said oh my god i
[22:22] am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
[22:24] to thee here's your blushing prophet
[22:26] acknowledging
[22:27] trespasses and sins and iniquities it
[22:30] says
[22:31] for our iniquities are increased over
[22:33] our head he's overwhelmed it's overgrown
[22:36] and our trespass has grown
[22:37] up unto the heavens since the days of
[22:40] our fathers have we
[22:41] been in a great trespass unto this day
[22:43] and for our iniquities have we
[22:46] our kings and our priests been delivered
[22:48] into the hand
[22:49] of the kings of the lands to the sword
[22:51] to captivity
[22:52] and to a spoil into the confusion of
[22:55] faith
[22:56] as it is this day this is an
[22:58] acknowledgement of very dire
[22:59] circumstances captivity spoil confusion
[23:01] of faith there's consternation
[23:03] there's no no place of rest there's no
[23:06] a place of belonging and then he says
[23:09] in this repentance and this
[23:11] acknowledgement that he
[23:13] i'm not worthy of good i'm not worthy of
[23:14] another opportunity he says
[23:16] and now for a little space grace have
[23:19] been showed
[23:21] from the lord our god there's been a new
[23:24] lease on life i've been
[23:25] we've been given breathing room we
[23:27] didn't deserve it we've been trespassing
[23:29] we've had iniquities that have increased
[23:31] to heaven they've grown over our heads
[23:32] and we've
[23:33] given ourselves over by our own accord
[23:35] to captivity spoil and confusion of face
[23:37] and this chaos
[23:38] but yet somehow some way you've given us
[23:40] breathing room
[23:42] somehow someway we'll be giving we're
[23:44] given an opportunity
[23:46] to start over again we were told that if
[23:48] we just keep your word that we would
[23:49] have this possession forever
[23:50] we didn't keep your word jerusalem was
[23:52] taken away from us so we don't deserve
[23:54] to keep it but now
[23:55] we're getting to go back we're getting
[23:58] to go back to jerusalem now you're
[23:59] giving us another chance
[24:01] from the kings and from those who are
[24:03] oppressors are telling us that we can
[24:04] build the walls again and it's like
[24:06] this is amazing we're beginning we're
[24:09] given a chance a little relief as it
[24:11] says
[24:11] to lighten our eyes that are well sorry
[24:14] to leave us
[24:15] a remnant to escape like we're getting
[24:17] free we're lit we're being let loose
[24:19] and notice this phrase here and to give
[24:21] us a nail in this holy place
[24:24] i'd like to come back to that this would
[24:26] become part of the
[24:28] foundation for the remainder of the
[24:29] service to give us a nail in this holy
[24:32] place that our god may lighten our eyes
[24:34] and give us a little reviving because
[24:36] we're given
[24:36] a nail in this holy place there's a
[24:39] lightening of our eyes there's a
[24:40] little revive and a new life new vigor
[24:43] in our bondage
[24:44] for we were bond men yet our god hath
[24:46] not forsaken us in our bondage but have
[24:48] extended mercy unto us in the sight of
[24:51] the kings of persia
[24:52] to give us a reviving
[24:56] newness of life to set up the house of
[24:58] our god and to repair the desolations
[25:00] thereof
[25:01] and to give us a wall in judah and in
[25:03] jerusalem
[25:04] he's describing something that was
[25:06] unexpected
[25:07] we didn't deserve this who would have
[25:09] ever thought that the walls of jerusalem
[25:10] would be raised again and be built up
[25:12] again
[25:13] this is prophecy we we didn't think of
[25:15] it we didn't hope for it we
[25:16] had asked for this we had deserved it
[25:18] but now here's another opportunity
[25:21] to give us a nail in this holy place and
[25:23] given this now
[25:24] god will lighten our eyes give us a
[25:25] little revive and we'll be able to set
[25:27] up and repair
[25:30] and when he uses the phrase ezra uses
[25:32] this phrase to give us a nail in his
[25:34] holy place
[25:36] this is a pen or a stake
[25:40] we hear about driving a stake down we we
[25:43] use that phrase to refer to i'm driving
[25:45] a stake down it becomes a reference
[25:47] point for you
[25:48] if it's a stake that's being driven down
[25:50] by a um a surveyor then they're marking
[25:52] a boundary they're driving a pin down
[25:54] we say i'm driving down a stake it's a
[25:56] reference point we want to go back later
[25:58] and say
[25:58] that day i made a promise that day i
[26:00] drove down a stake that day
[26:02] i've established a reference point and
[26:05] that's going to be an anchor point
[26:07] driving down a stake when you when
[26:08] you're climbing uh when you're climbing
[26:10] a mountain since i look like a mountain
[26:11] climber
[26:12] i'm just guessing at this i see them
[26:14] drive stakes and i'm assuming
[26:16] that this becomes an anchor point that
[26:18] if they're going to fall or lose their
[26:19] footing
[26:20] it stops there at least that looks like
[26:22] what they're doing they may be doing the
[26:23] exact opposite
[26:24] i don't know i'm not a mountain climber
[26:26] when i'm when i turn 49 i may want to
[26:28] climb mount everest i don't know
[26:30] but they drive down a stake they drive a
[26:32] pin in it's like you know what
[26:34] i feel comfortable because i've been
[26:35] able to establish this mark i've got
[26:37] this position
[26:38] so when he says to give us a nail in
[26:40] this holy place it's a pen or a stake
[26:42] and the word that's used here is
[26:44] associated with the tents
[26:45] that they would establish in the
[26:46] wilderness when the children of israel
[26:48] are in their exodus
[26:49] and especially with the tabernacle when
[26:51] they would set it up when they would
[26:53] fashion it and fasten it down and make
[26:55] sure that it was secure they would use
[26:56] these
[26:57] tent these stakes and these pins and
[26:59] these cords
[27:00] and they would drive them in and then
[27:02] they would be anchored and say this is
[27:04] secure
[27:05] and this is what ezra is referring to is
[27:07] it says in isaiah chapter 22
[27:09] verse 23 just to see this language
[27:11] that's used about a nail
[27:13] in a hole in his holy place and i will
[27:15] fasten him as a nail in a sure place
[27:18] and he shall be for a glorious throne to
[27:20] his father's house
[27:21] i will set him fasten him as a nail in a
[27:24] sure place
[27:25] this is what ezra's referring to a nail
[27:27] in a sure place there's going to be
[27:29] solid footing there's going to be a an
[27:32] anchoring point this is
[27:33] good ground this is going to stand this
[27:35] is going to be a permanent this is going
[27:36] to withstand the wind this is going to
[27:38] withstand you're not going to be able to
[27:40] just rip this thing up very easily i'm
[27:42] going to set him as a nail in a sure
[27:44] place
[27:44] this is something secure when you have a
[27:47] nail in a sure place you're like
[27:49] well that will that hold i don't know it
[27:50] looks like it and let me try and wait we
[27:53] hang on it right we're gonna see well
[27:54] this hole will this work
[27:56] and when you know that it can hold when
[27:57] you know it'll hang because it's you
[27:59] found the stud you're anchored in
[28:01] something solid this is exactly what
[28:03] it's referring to
[28:04] isaiah chapter 33 verse 20 look upon
[28:07] zion
[28:08] the city of our solemnities thine eyes
[28:11] shall see jerusalem
[28:13] a quiet habitation tabernacle that shall
[28:16] not be taken down this is
[28:18] language being used at the tabernacle
[28:20] very similar to the language that ezra
[28:21] is using
[28:22] a nail in this holy place to give us
[28:23] reviving to set up the house of our god
[28:25] to repair the desolations to give us a
[28:27] wall
[28:27] here jerusalem's going to be a quiet
[28:29] habitation a tabernacle that shall not
[28:31] be taken down
[28:33] not one of the stakes thereof shall ever
[28:35] be removed
[28:37] neither shall any of the cords thereof
[28:39] be broken
[28:41] this is what he's referring to and he
[28:42] says to give us a nail in this holy
[28:44] place
[28:45] to give us a settlement not tossed and
[28:48] removed from place to place by our
[28:50] masters and by
[28:51] kings and by governments however they
[28:52] wanted us move us here move us there
[28:54] tell us to do this tell us to do that
[28:56] but we have a settlement a place of a
[28:58] fixed place
[29:00] and this is what ezra's desiring he's
[29:01] desiring a fixed settlement
[29:03] in the land of judea he's desiring a
[29:06] permanent location in the temple of the
[29:08] lord
[29:08] where we can drive down a stake we can
[29:10] drive in our pins we can
[29:12] we can set it as a as a nail fastened in
[29:14] a secure place
[29:16] they desired the place of god sanctuary
[29:19] jerusalem a quiet habitation a resting
[29:23] place is the language he's using
[29:25] where they were supported to gain new
[29:28] life
[29:29] a reviving
[29:32] this is how isaiah excuse me ezra is
[29:34] describing his feelings
[29:36] in a moment of despair and heaviness and
[29:39] a blessing prophet
[29:41] sensing an opportunity to erase decades
[29:44] of sins
[29:46] hundreds of years of iniquities that
[29:48] have been accumulated and piling on
[29:49] here's a prophet
[29:51] sensing this is extraordinary
[29:54] we as a people we as a nation are being
[29:56] given a chance by god
[29:57] to start over again this is the language
[30:01] of the prophet that can relate to
[30:03] the psychology that we were referring to
[30:05] a moment ago that causes the nine enders
[30:07] to
[30:08] search their lives and begin to engage
[30:10] in activities to find meaning
[30:12] ezra's using a language that speaks to
[30:14] these needs and desires that we have in
[30:16] our hearts
[30:17] and because we have these desires and
[30:19] even this need it causes us as i said
[30:21] before
[30:22] to always be looking to always be
[30:25] searching
[30:26] and in searching we're trying to find a
[30:28] place to drive a nail
[30:30] we want to feel settled trying to find a
[30:33] place to finally stand up catch our
[30:35] breath
[30:36] from this point on i can do the things
[30:38] that i always
[30:39] wanted to do as ezra said to give us a
[30:41] little reviving ezra's looking for a
[30:43] landmark this temporal landmark a fresh
[30:46] start a place of springing up
[30:48] now doesn't matter what's happened
[30:49] before now grace has been shown
[30:52] now there's been mercy shown to us now's
[30:54] our time this is our moment now we can
[30:56] start all over again
[30:58] this is an opportunity now start to use
[31:00] the language in our minds as we've read
[31:02] this and we've read ezra
[31:03] we could use a language that maybe we
[31:04] use with each other this time it's going
[31:06] to be different
[31:07] now i can start this this is an
[31:09] opportunity to start he's saying we've
[31:10] been released from the bondage of our
[31:12] oppressors released from the bondage of
[31:14] our sins
[31:15] we can be released from all the bondage
[31:17] of our bad habits bad decisions
[31:18] all these different things that can hang
[31:20] on to us and now
[31:21] i feel like i can breathe we've gotten
[31:24] out from underneath that now
[31:25] now there's new hope now hope is spring
[31:27] and eternal this
[31:28] is like springtime this is a chance this
[31:31] is an opportunity
[31:33] i know that there's these things begin
[31:35] to come into my mind how
[31:37] god gives us an opportunity by even
[31:40] refinancing or selling a home and we
[31:42] feel like you know what
[31:42] we can start over again we're not upside
[31:44] down
[31:46] we're we're not we're we're not under
[31:48] this weight anymore we've been we've
[31:50] gotten past that
[31:50] and we thought oh now now's our chance
[31:52] now is our opportunity
[31:54] it feels great when that happens doesn't
[31:56] it
[31:58] at least that's what our neighbors in
[31:59] the apartment next door tell us it's
[32:01] awesome when that happens we've got
[32:02] everything figured out
[32:03] so nirvana is just kind of like the
[32:05] constant state that we live in
[32:10] but let me ask you this since we can be
[32:12] honest since the the
[32:14] neighbors just dropped off the stream
[32:15] let's just be honest with ourselves
[32:18] have you ever been in such a mess that
[32:19] you just wanted to start over
[32:25] it's it's like what we learned
[32:29] with our first nintendo the reset button
[32:32] solves all our problems
[32:34] right that's all we need to do we just
[32:37] need to hit reset
[32:39] that's the problem control alt delete
[32:42] restart it
[32:44] hey let me save the husbands and the
[32:46] teenagers
[32:47] uh 15 minutes tomorrow mom have you
[32:50] restarted your phone
[32:52] right just restart it see if that works
[32:55] because that's what we've learned
[32:57] starting something over again sometimes
[32:59] fixes what's wrong because the process
[33:01] has been running and
[33:02] something's accumulated and memory is
[33:03] being hog and there's no way to dump it
[33:05] and something just keeps
[33:06] building and building and building and
[33:07] the only way to get things back to the
[33:09] way they need to be we don't need to
[33:10] panic and go buy a new
[33:12] macbook pro we don't need to panic and
[33:13] go get the geek squad to figure this
[33:15] thing out
[33:16] have you started with restarting it
[33:19] to start all over again and i'm asking
[33:22] have you ever been in that place where
[33:23] you just wanted to
[33:24] hit reset like if i could only be
[33:27] eight years old again playing super
[33:29] mario bros and just hit reset just start
[33:31] over
[33:32] when you're getting beat and tecmo
[33:34] bowling you and there's no way you can
[33:35] come back and ah
[33:36] just hit reset start over
[33:40] we can feel this way with things that
[33:41] are very important not um our quest to
[33:44] speedrun super mario brothers but
[33:46] in relationships we can get so far
[33:50] behind in relationships
[33:52] and have so much history and mistakes
[33:54] we've made mistakes they've made so much
[33:57] so much of a past in our own
[33:58] relationships to where we feel like we
[34:00] can never catch up
[34:02] how am i gonna make this right or how
[34:04] can i get over that and we can do this
[34:06] in relationships
[34:07] where we feel like i don't i don't see a
[34:09] way out of this
[34:11] i don't see a way for this just to to
[34:14] recover
[34:14] and what we would love to be able to
[34:16] have is that reset button in our
[34:17] relationships with
[34:18] let's just go over here and hit reset
[34:20] and we're starting again from ground
[34:21] zero
[34:22] starting from scratch starting all over
[34:24] again
[34:25] and wouldn't it be nice if you could do
[34:27] that and the and just as the game
[34:29] doesn't remember any of your prior bad
[34:31] moves
[34:31] neither does your spouse right
[34:35] and it's not being held over our head
[34:37] this is what we think about would say
[34:38] well i'm in a mess i wish i could start
[34:40] all over again i don't like the way
[34:41] things have gone
[34:42] what are we looking for an opportunity
[34:44] to start over
[34:46] so we do when we go through it we have a
[34:48] cleanse we detox it or we do something
[34:50] where we're wanting our
[34:51] body to restart and there's a lot of
[34:53] them out there that really don't do
[34:54] anything
[34:55] physiologically to the body but it's all
[34:57] in the head and it's all you need
[35:00] if you could somehow convince yourself
[35:01] that all these pills i'm taking
[35:03] are giving me a fresh start and you're
[35:05] convinced that's all you need to know
[35:07] even if your gut doesn't know
[35:09] the fact that your mind does the placebo
[35:11] effect is real
[35:13] and we shouldn't necessarily belittle it
[35:15] because it produces results when it
[35:17] comes to certain things
[35:18] and this is the psychology this is
[35:20] what's in our minds we want to start all
[35:22] over again we want to be able to catch
[35:23] up we want to cleanse we want to detox
[35:25] we want to declutter we want to
[35:26] minimalize we want to sell we want to
[35:28] get rid of we want to start fresh and
[35:30] clean we want to find a place
[35:32] to start fresh again
[35:36] and i want to zero in on something how
[35:38] the word
[35:40] you turn to john chapter 3.
[35:43] the word gives us a foundational answer
[35:45] the word gives us
[35:46] foundational answers but a foundational
[35:48] answer
[35:50] to man's search for a clean slate
[35:54] man is a creature of thought we have
[35:57] imagination conscience memory reason and
[35:59] affection they're all connected and
[36:00] relate together
[36:02] and there's a way that the each one of
[36:04] these holds a memory
[36:06] each one of these is recording things if
[36:09] you ever disliked something you'll have
[36:11] this
[36:11] it's programmed in you this dislike
[36:14] a bad experience with a particular food
[36:16] can be within your
[36:18] psyche decades later for just the
[36:20] thought of it ah no thank you i had a
[36:22] bad experience at a church potluck
[36:24] uh last week last decade last year
[36:28] whenever it was right
[36:29] like i don't know and it's something
[36:30] that holds in your mind so it's not just
[36:33] memory is not just the one place where
[36:34] but it's it's feelings and sensations
[36:37] and thoughts and emotions
[36:38] and there's a place that god wants to
[36:40] bring us all as individuals
[36:42] and it's the foundational point to begin
[36:44] to satisfy this need that we have as
[36:46] humans
[36:48] and begin to find that there is a place
[36:49] where hope does spring eternal
[36:52] in john chapter 3 we'll go ahead and
[36:54] just read verses 1 to 9.
[36:56] there was a man of the pharisees named
[36:57] nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[36:59] the same came to jesus by night and said
[37:01] unto him rabbi we know that thou art a
[37:03] teacher
[37:04] come from god for no man can do these
[37:06] miracles that thou
[37:07] doest except god be with him jesus
[37:11] answered and said unto him and i think
[37:13] it's this is me personally
[37:16] it's a peculiar answer to his statement
[37:19] but it's so it's so profound and
[37:21] introductory to us
[37:23] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[37:25] man be born again he cannot
[37:27] see the kingdom of god is he answering
[37:30] to the fact that nicodemus is reasoning
[37:32] with this and
[37:33] i know you're a teacher and if you're
[37:34] doing these things this must be
[37:36] god who's doing and he said is he saying
[37:38] well unless you're born again you're
[37:39] really not going to know what's taking
[37:40] place and what's happening
[37:42] but his statement except a man be born
[37:44] again he cannot see the kingdom of god
[37:46] it catches nicodemus off guard
[37:48] and nicodemus saith unto him how can a
[37:50] man be born when he is old
[37:52] because to be born is a new beginning
[37:54] it's a fresh start it's newness it's
[37:56] infancy it's it's it's innocence and of
[37:59] something fresh can he enter the second
[38:02] time in his mother's womb and be
[38:04] born jesus answered verily verily i said
[38:06] to thee except a man be born of water
[38:08] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[38:10] the kingdom of god
[38:11] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[38:13] so now we see a difference between flesh
[38:15] and spirit and that which is born of the
[38:16] spirit of spirit you can be have a first
[38:18] birth which is what nicodemus is
[38:19] relating to things through but jesus is
[38:21] saying
[38:22] there's got to be a second birth
[38:23] nicodemus uses the language can he enter
[38:25] into his mother's womb
[38:26] and be born a second time but jesus is
[38:28] talking about a
[38:29] second birth a very real literal second
[38:32] birth but it's one in which you're born
[38:34] of
[38:34] the spirit marvel not that i said
[38:37] unto thee ye must be born again the wind
[38:40] bloweth where it listeth and thou hears
[38:41] the sound thereof but can't
[38:43] tell not tell whence it cometh and
[38:45] whether it goeth so is everyone that is
[38:47] born of the spirit
[38:49] so nicodemus trying to figure these
[38:51] things out with his question jesus
[38:53] answer
[38:54] he exclaims out loud in verse 9
[38:57] how can these things be
[39:01] nicodemus is perplexed by the phrase
[39:04] that christ
[39:04] uses or in the way that christ
[39:08] uses it except a man be born again
[39:11] and i say it that way he was perplexed
[39:13] with the context that jesus is using
[39:15] he's perplexed with the way that jesus
[39:18] is using the phrase
[39:19] that a man must be born again because
[39:22] the jews believe that a convert to their
[39:24] religion a convert to judaism
[39:26] was like a child born anew they used
[39:29] that phrase of a proselyte
[39:31] when they were converted to the the law
[39:33] converted to judaism
[39:35] they said this man is like a man that is
[39:37] born anew
[39:38] but to them they recognize this as being
[39:40] a civil birth that they were born into
[39:42] the certain privileges
[39:43] that a natural jew had and that a jew
[39:46] who was born of it by blood would enjoy
[39:48] so they would say you're starting over
[39:50] again within
[39:51] judaism but jesus the language he uses
[39:54] even catches this jew off guard and he's
[39:56] like wait a minute
[39:57] i don't know how these things can be i i
[39:59] can understand that when someone
[40:00] converts to our religion and converts to
[40:02] believing the one true god that we're
[40:04] like hey you're like starting all over
[40:05] again you're a child
[40:06] being born anew but jesus is pointing to
[40:10] a birth from above that changes a
[40:12] person's nature because he says
[40:14] hey who's born of the flesh is flesh if
[40:16] you're a jew convert or
[40:17] a heathen converting to judaism you're
[40:19] still flash
[40:20] but i'm talking about someone being born
[40:22] a second time from above
[40:24] not being like a child born a new but
[40:26] someone who is born
[40:28] he's using a language that speaks of a
[40:30] life beginning anew
[40:32] beginning a and i believe it's scofield
[40:34] that uses this language beginning a
[40:36] fundamental
[40:37] impermanent revolution it's the
[40:40] beginning of a fundamental and permanent
[40:42] revolution
[40:43] within the believer's heart where this
[40:44] is something that's ongoing i've been
[40:46] born again
[40:47] just as much as a natural birth sets you
[40:49] within a process
[40:50] that in natural things culminates not
[40:53] only in physical maturity and emotional
[40:55] maturity
[40:55] but ultimately results in the in the
[40:57] grave jesus is saying there is a
[40:59] birth that results in a fundamental and
[41:01] permanent revolution
[41:03] that for the believer does not result in
[41:05] death but a translation
[41:09] it is if i could say this for the elect
[41:11] our spring
[41:14] it's our spring in a lifetime that has
[41:17] one spring
[41:18] and will never have a winter
[41:21] it's when new life is born where we can
[41:24] talk about newness and freshness
[41:27] there's a reviving this is an experience
[41:29] where every single one of us
[41:31] will know a second chance
[41:34] a real one too
[41:38] to be born again is not the reformation
[41:40] of our person
[41:42] it is not moving from new york to los
[41:44] angeles it is not
[41:45] buying a new house it is not changing
[41:48] your diet from veganism to all meat it's
[41:50] not
[41:51] this is not the reformation of a person
[41:53] this is a creative
[41:54] act of god this is a supernatural
[41:58] regeneration this is something taken
[42:00] deep
[42:01] within a person's spirit in a
[42:04] supernatural level
[42:05] romans chapter 6 verse 6 knowing this
[42:07] that our old man is crucified with him
[42:10] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[42:12] that henceforth we should not serve
[42:14] sin now this is again just as ezra used
[42:18] it and i'm wanting to
[42:20] call us back to this he's touching on
[42:22] this human psychology
[42:24] by saying that was the old guy
[42:28] that was the old me i didn't know you
[42:31] did that oh yeah
[42:32] i i i i stopped doing whatever last year
[42:35] or
[42:36] there was a point when ever since i
[42:38] turned 40 i run marathons or ever since
[42:40] i did this
[42:41] this happens and we can actually take
[42:43] every bad habit every
[42:44] every pound and every mistake and every
[42:47] every dollar lost and every credit card
[42:50] uh um that we've maxed out and every car
[42:52] repossessed and every house foreclosed
[42:54] we could pin it on the old guy
[42:59] right don't we do that we do that and
[43:01] this is exactly
[43:03] what um paul is referring to now in a
[43:05] very real literal
[43:07] fundamental sense that we all long for
[43:09] like oh well how come you're bringing
[43:10] that up i mean i did that
[43:12] six years ago well you gotta wait seven
[43:13] years before that drops off oh okay well
[43:15] i guess we'll wait another year honey
[43:18] it's on your record somewhere you want
[43:19] to get free from it well now
[43:21] paul is saying that this old man it
[43:23] literally means your old self
[43:26] your past person is dead it's been
[43:28] crucified with christ
[43:31] it's establishing a supernatural reality
[43:35] to what we actually try to create with
[43:36] our temporal landmarks
[43:39] yesterday was the first day of spring
[43:41] now things are going to be different
[43:43] this is the supernatural reality this is
[43:44] the real deal
[43:46] to all of our new year's resolutions our
[43:47] temporal landmarks the opportunity to
[43:49] start over again
[43:51] a new job the new house finally getting
[43:53] married all these things
[43:55] what is it we say with respect to with
[43:57] respect to new year's resolutions
[43:59] all my failures from the past were the
[44:01] old guy
[44:04] hey man i buried that out in 2020 that
[44:07] you can't hold that against me anymore
[44:09] that was that's the old man that's the
[44:10] old one
[44:12] somebody said to me i said the other day
[44:13] that um when i say last year
[44:15] i'm referring to 2019. that makes a lot
[44:17] of sense
[44:20] last year doesn't count so not only is
[44:23] the old man dead
[44:24] he didn't even do anything in 2020 it
[44:26] doesn't count
[44:27] we have this idea that this is that's
[44:30] the old guy the new me is different
[44:31] don't hold that against me
[44:33] yeah yeah yeah i know you're all nervous
[44:34] about inviting me over for a party but
[44:36] that was the old me i'm different now
[44:37] i've changed
[44:39] don't worry but i i'm more reserved i'm
[44:41] more careful i can do this i can do that
[44:43] and this is what we do we actually in
[44:45] the natural not religious not super
[44:47] spiritual not christians not jews or
[44:50] or um or christians but we establish
[44:52] this line
[44:53] of uh where i've drawn the line from
[44:55] this moment forward this is the new me
[44:58] and you can't hold all those things
[45:00] about the old guy against me
[45:01] because i've started over i've got a new
[45:04] outlook on life i've got a new beginning
[45:06] so this is literally god has given us
[45:09] this opportunity through a new birth
[45:12] and really when you think about this
[45:14] idea that well when i say last year i'm
[45:15] referring to 2019
[45:19] this is our attempt to disconnect
[45:21] ourselves from our past
[45:22] mistakes it's our attempt to say you
[45:25] know what that doesn't count i've got a
[45:26] clean slate
[45:27] in order to do what boost our efforts to
[45:29] start over again that's like well if
[45:32] you're gonna
[45:32] if if that's still the case then i might
[45:34] as well
[45:36] right well if you're gonna hold that
[45:37] over my head i might as well
[45:39] be guilty of it or if you're gonna do
[45:40] that i might as well do this and what if
[45:42] it's gonna still be laid against us if
[45:44] it's still gonna be on our record if
[45:45] it's still going to be at our charge
[45:46] then i might as well continue to keep
[45:48] doing what i was doing as a result of it
[45:50] does that make sense
[45:52] i have the picture in my mind and i'm
[45:53] doing a poor job of explaining it to you
[45:55] but it's it's this idea that i can
[45:58] somehow
[45:59] disassociate from my past that kind of
[46:01] gives us this thought
[46:02] you know what i can do this this is a
[46:04] new opportunity this is a fresh start
[46:06] and it's what gives us it boosts our
[46:08] efforts to spring forward
[46:10] and to begin something again
[46:15] and th this what we're looking at in
[46:17] john chapter 3 is the scripture way to
[46:18] do it without the result
[46:20] of an accumulation of a bunch of
[46:21] disappointments
[46:24] how many fresh starts have we had how
[46:27] many new beginnings
[46:28] how many second chances how many times
[46:30] have we said this time it's different
[46:31] and there's a way that this begins to
[46:33] wear on us it's of no fault other than
[46:36] our own but not to the in the sense that
[46:38] we ought to condemn ourselves it's like
[46:39] this is just human nature what did you
[46:40] expect
[46:42] we're always going to be hope springs
[46:44] eternal this time it's going to be
[46:45] different this time it's going to be new
[46:46] this time i'm going to see it through
[46:48] this time i'm going to make better
[46:49] decisions and this time i promise honey
[46:51] it's going to be different this time i
[46:52] promise i'm going to get i'm going to do
[46:53] my job right this time i'm going to do
[46:55] it this time i'm going to do it and we
[46:56] feel like i've got a chance i got a
[46:57] chance i have this landmark it's going
[46:59] to be different and somehow just through
[47:00] the war of attrition we go right back
[47:02] into the same thing again
[47:04] but what jesus is pointing out is a
[47:06] scriptural way to have a second chance a
[47:08] fresh start
[47:09] without the accumulation of all the
[47:10] disappointments
[47:12] why because we can actually say the old
[47:14] man is dead
[47:16] he's not even around anymore romans
[47:18] chapter 6 verse 4
[47:20] as it just proceeded this old man is
[47:22] crucified therefore we are buried with
[47:24] him
[47:25] by baptism and to death that like as
[47:27] christ was raised up
[47:28] sprung up resurrection springtime raised
[47:31] up from the dead by the glory of the
[47:32] father
[47:33] even so we also should walk
[47:36] in newness of life
[47:39] he want god wants you this is something
[47:41] god wants you to experience he wants you
[47:44] to experience a fresh start
[47:46] and the scripture is constantly sharing
[47:48] this with you and i believe we've
[47:50] we must understand this if you have been
[47:52] born again
[47:53] and you become uh baptized by the spirit
[47:56] into the body of christ
[47:58] then god wants you to have to know that
[48:01] that was a fresh start
[48:02] and if it's not your own attempts let it
[48:04] be known that any man's attempt
[48:06] to bring something up from your past to
[48:09] bear upon your present
[48:11] and to think that it'll alter your
[48:12] future outside the context of this new
[48:15] birth that's tethered me to eternity
[48:17] you have a right to say no that man is
[48:19] dead
[48:20] or woman you have a right to say no it's
[48:24] been buried it's over
[48:26] and accept the fact that you have power
[48:28] to resurrect an old nature
[48:30] and in doing so by language and conduct
[48:32] that's the only way your past can have
[48:34] power over you
[48:35] if you use your ability to resurrect it
[48:37] and stand
[48:38] firm on this position to say no it's
[48:41] dead
[48:42] it's buried i won't let my fears my
[48:44] anxieties and my weaknesses and my
[48:46] suspicions
[48:46] resurrect an old nature that the word
[48:49] has told me is dead and buried with
[48:50] christ
[48:52] and don't let somebody else bring up a
[48:54] ghost of your past
[48:56] hold it over your head counting the
[48:59] times you've moved
[49:00] count the times you've made mistakes and
[49:02] so how many times is this you're going
[49:03] to try to come to church again
[49:05] don't let them do it it's a place where
[49:08] you can start fresh
[49:11] a new beginning something unprecedented
[49:13] in other words all our efforts
[49:15] that where we end up back at the same
[49:16] place again
[49:18] this time this is something new because
[49:20] you don't write you don't come back to
[49:22] where you started again
[49:24] you've started it was it was brother
[49:26] lucas who had the never-ending beginning
[49:29] was their wedding url or something like
[49:32] that many many years ago
[49:33] is the website still up no but the
[49:36] marriage is
[49:37] that's good right it's something that
[49:39] starts it's not going to end
[49:41] don't worry about this this is just when
[49:43] we look back on this it'll be just a
[49:45] little mist a little vapor
[49:47] something's just begun it's
[49:48] unprecedented there's nothing in your
[49:50] life right now when you were born again
[49:53] and if you're forgetting about what this
[49:54] meant when you were born again this is
[49:56] the purpose of it is kind of remove the
[49:58] cobwebs and dust things off
[49:59] and remove all the confusion say look
[50:01] when you were born again there's
[50:03] no metric there's nothing from the past
[50:05] there's no personal paradigm that you
[50:07] can go back and have a reference point
[50:08] to try to figure out what's happened
[50:10] this is unprecedented
[50:13] we can use things like well it's like
[50:15] when a baby's born and well it's like
[50:16] this happening
[50:17] but really it's never happened before
[50:19] for you
[50:22] soul is made new he's using a language
[50:25] he says to walk in
[50:26] newness of life he's using a language
[50:28] that should connect with our longing to
[50:29] start over
[50:31] is he using a language that's that's
[50:33] rooted deep within our psychology
[50:35] can i start over can i have a fresh
[50:36] start well i won't be able to i can't
[50:38] start unless i'm given a chance i have
[50:41] to have a point to begin
[50:43] and we look for it well why don't you do
[50:45] it now well i'm waiting for this i'm
[50:46] waiting for something to happen
[50:48] and it gives us that boost that we need
[50:50] the psychological edge that we can
[50:52] do it ephesians chapter 4 verses 22 to
[50:55] 24
[50:56] that you put off concerning the former
[50:58] conversation the old man
[51:00] which is corrupt according to the
[51:01] deceitful lust you can put him off
[51:03] because he's dead
[51:05] put them off this is the new behavior
[51:07] that you've engaged in
[51:08] which is after god is created which
[51:11] after god is created
[51:12] in well let me i think i just skipped
[51:15] here
[51:16] that you put off concerning the former
[51:17] conversation the old man which is
[51:18] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[51:20] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[51:22] mind and that ye put on
[51:24] the new man this is the putting on of
[51:26] the new man it's not
[51:28] necessarily a one-time uh
[51:31] change of robe but it's an opportunity
[51:33] for constant renewal
[51:34] we're putting off the old man we're
[51:36] putting on the new man this is daily
[51:37] renewal daily dying daily reviving
[51:41] which is corrupt according to the
[51:42] deceitfulness be renewed in the spirit
[51:44] of mind put on the new man which is
[51:45] after god
[51:46] is created in righteousness and true
[51:48] holiness
[51:50] a new man is this not the language we
[51:53] use on january 1st
[51:55] i'm a new man this is the language we
[51:57] use when we turn
[51:58] 50. this is the language that we use
[51:59] when this landmark this temporal
[52:01] landmark
[52:02] i'm a new woman this is a chip fresh
[52:04] it's spring
[52:05] yesterday was the first day of spring
[52:07] i'm going to be different this time
[52:11] and this is exactly what paul is saying
[52:13] you get when you're born again
[52:16] as it says in second corinthians chapter
[52:17] 5 verse 17
[52:20] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[52:22] a new
[52:23] creature i know we it said with such
[52:27] repetition
[52:28] and often with such force that it might
[52:30] have a way of just getting dull by
[52:32] the time it gets to our hearts but this
[52:33] is powerful if any man
[52:35] be in christ by one spirit we're
[52:37] baptized into christ by being born again
[52:38] by the spirit of god and being sealed
[52:40] into his body
[52:41] we are a new creation new creatures in
[52:44] christ
[52:45] all things are passed away like winter
[52:48] being gone everything's in the past it
[52:50] no longer is present we don't have to
[52:51] worry about winter the chill the snow
[52:53] the darkness
[52:54] old things are passed away behold all
[52:56] things are become
[52:58] new this is a language to say
[53:01] now everything changes
[53:04] if you've had a habit that you it can
[53:07] change
[53:08] if you've had a history it can change if
[53:10] you've had a potential propensity to do
[53:12] something
[53:13] now it can change now it doesn't mean
[53:14] everything has changed but he wants you
[53:16] to be in the frame of mind to believe
[53:18] that it can change that
[53:21] we say well i got born again but this
[53:24] still happens and that still happens
[53:26] that's because you haven't fully yielded
[53:28] to this like
[53:29] the reality that everything's different
[53:32] now
[53:33] and we give in to some of these familiar
[53:35] feelings something starts coming around
[53:36] oh i know what's happening
[53:37] okay well i guess i just might as well
[53:39] do it instead of realizing wait a minute
[53:42] the mechanisms are different this time
[53:44] yes it's the same old familiar feeling
[53:46] but now i realize
[53:48] i'm not the same person you don't have
[53:50] that power over me
[53:52] i don't have to answer to that
[53:55] i don't have to respond to that this is
[53:56] not my lot in life this is not my
[53:58] temptation this is not my weakness
[54:00] my family history has been broken my my
[54:03] addictions have been broken my bad
[54:04] habits have been broken
[54:06] how right now suddenly i believe that
[54:08] i'm as being a new
[54:10] creature in christ jesus all things have
[54:12] become new
[54:14] well you're still walking kind of in
[54:15] that old stuff well with each step it
[54:17] becomes new with each step it's becoming
[54:19] new
[54:19] all things are becoming new and that's
[54:21] the mindset i want to have that's the
[54:22] belief in the faith that i want to have
[54:24] things are becoming new
[54:28] c.s lewis when he was uh
[54:32] now i'm forgetting what the name of the
[54:35] um i think it's a sudden the suddenness
[54:38] of joy actually
[54:40] i think is the name of his kind of his
[54:42] autobiography he writes about
[54:44] his uh his life and his path in life he
[54:47] ends this book
[54:48] and he's an incredible writer and this
[54:50] book is just filled with so many
[54:52] different references it's
[54:54] incredible work but he comes to the
[54:56] conclusion of his book and he says but
[54:57] what
[54:58] in conclusion of joy because that was
[55:00] the name of the title of the book some
[55:01] say it was inspired by
[55:03] a wadsworth a wordsworth poem called the
[55:06] suddenness of joy
[55:08] so at the very end he comes back to that
[55:10] he goes what about joy then
[55:12] isn't that what we all want joy
[55:14] happiness you know i said well i just
[55:16] hope you're happy
[55:16] right now what we say to people when we
[55:18] disagree with what they're doing
[55:20] and uh and so we just try to pin it on
[55:21] the fact that they're just always
[55:22] disgruntled they're never happy
[55:24] well i sure hope you're happy how's that
[55:27] working out for you happy
[55:29] and and so that because that kind of
[55:30] becomes the end all right
[55:32] happiness and joy and we really think of
[55:34] it in terms of a personal
[55:36] satisfaction not even a supernatural
[55:38] spiritual saturday but i just want to
[55:39] feel fulfilled i want to be happy
[55:41] and the truth is as the book is written
[55:42] you truly just stumble on happiness what
[55:44] you think is going to make you happy
[55:45] doesn't really make you happy
[55:46] so this right here to me is so profound
[55:49] what about joy what's the conclusion
[55:51] for that after all is what the story has
[55:53] mainly been about
[55:55] to tell you the truth the subject has
[55:57] nearly lost all interest for me since i
[55:59] became a christian
[56:02] but the subject of finding happiness and
[56:04] finding joy and getting pleasure and
[56:06] being fulfilled yeah
[56:07] you know since i became a christian just
[56:09] doesn't mean what it used to to me
[56:11] before
[56:11] right everything's changed all things
[56:14] have become new yeah some of
[56:16] all the old things are still around but
[56:19] it's new to me because i'm looking at it
[56:20] different
[56:22] the pursuit of joy the pursuit of
[56:23] happiness the pursuit of this perfection
[56:25] this and all these things they're all
[56:26] around us they're still there but you
[56:27] know what i'm a new man now and though
[56:30] the old things are there all things have
[56:31] become new to me
[56:33] and it doesn't mean to me like what it
[56:34] used to mean he says i cannot indeed
[56:37] complain like
[56:38] wordsworth that the visionary gleam is
[56:41] passed away he wrote the poem
[56:47] about the passing of his daughter and
[56:50] how that
[56:50] there was a moment the suddenness of joy
[56:53] this is a man who lost his heart he has
[56:54] this suddenness of joy
[56:56] and he wants to share with his daughter
[56:57] only to realize she's gone
[57:00] and so it's a it's a it's an interesting
[57:02] poem and this is what c.s lewis is
[57:04] referring to
[57:05] i mean i hope that maybe those of you
[57:07] who like the chronicles of narnia
[57:09] have you know given me some credibility
[57:11] by reading quoting
[57:13] c.s lewis but it is profound i want you
[57:15] to stay with this
[57:16] if you can i can't complain like this
[57:19] poet
[57:20] that the visionary gleam has passed away
[57:22] i believe
[57:23] if the thing were at all worth recording
[57:26] that the old stab
[57:28] the old bittersweet has come to me as
[57:32] often and as sharply since my conversion
[57:34] as at any time of my life whatever
[57:38] the pain of loss the disappointment the
[57:40] sorrow i have been visited by the stab
[57:43] he says the bittersweet
[57:46] i felt it and you know what i may have
[57:48] felt it more now as a christian than i
[57:49] did before i was a christian
[57:51] now that seems like it would be fodder
[57:53] for the critic but notice what he says
[57:54] but i now know that that
[57:56] experience i now know that experience
[57:59] considered as a state of mind had never
[58:02] had the kind of importance i once gave
[58:04] it
[58:05] oh isn't that wonderful sorry for
[58:07] getting excited about c.s lewis
[58:08] but he says i now know that that state
[58:12] of mind those emotions and those
[58:14] feelings
[58:14] never ever were as important as i
[58:17] thought they should be
[58:18] why because i'm a new creature now i
[58:21] i've been born again i i feel new i feel
[58:24] fresh and everything it's all still
[58:26] there but it doesn't mean the same thing
[58:28] to me anymore
[58:30] it was valuable only as a pointer to
[58:32] something other and outer
[58:34] while the other was in doubt the pointer
[58:36] naturally loomed larger in my thoughts
[58:38] it was only a pointer that there was a
[58:40] place of rest
[58:40] a place of happiness a place of healing
[58:42] a place of joy in jesus christ
[58:45] all those pains and all those
[58:46] disappointments were only a pointer to
[58:48] the one who can satisfy
[58:49] and he says while that one was in doubt
[58:51] why i did not know him the pointer
[58:53] loomed much bigger in my life but now
[58:56] that i have him the pointer
[58:58] can't hurt me like it could before
[59:01] and then he uses this phrase i wanted to
[59:04] expound upon this
[59:05] in a different way when we are lost in
[59:07] the woods the sight of a signpost
[59:09] is a great matter when you're lost and
[59:13] you first see the sign
[59:15] are we on the right path i don't know i
[59:17] haven't seen a sign i don't know should
[59:18] we turn around what should we do
[59:20] and then you see it then the sign tells
[59:22] you how many miles away it is and what
[59:24] the exit is you're like
[59:25] oh oh that was good that's great always
[59:27] saw it we know we're on the right path
[59:29] he says look it's a great matter he who
[59:32] first sees it christ
[59:33] look the whole party gathers around and
[59:36] stares
[59:37] but when we have found the road and are
[59:40] passing signposts every few miles
[59:42] we shall not stop and stare when you're
[59:45] lost when you find it you stop and you
[59:47] look at
[59:48] oh oh my look at this this is it he says
[59:50] but then once you found the road
[59:52] and you see the signpost you don't stop
[59:54] and stare they will encourage us
[59:57] and we shall be grateful to the
[59:58] authority that has set them up but we
[1:00:00] shall not
[1:00:00] stop and stare or not much not on this
[1:00:03] road though their
[1:00:04] pillars are of silver and their
[1:00:06] lettering of gold we
[1:00:07] would be at jerusalem and then he gives
[1:00:11] the last decl
[1:00:12] disclaimer before he ends his
[1:00:13] autobiography goes not that i haven't
[1:00:14] stopped a little bit too much along the
[1:00:16] way
[1:00:16] but let this part be the point that he's
[1:00:18] trying to make that when you're in the
[1:00:20] world and you have not been born again
[1:00:21] the pointers seem
[1:00:23] much bigger than they do when you're
[1:00:24] born again and when you're in the world
[1:00:26] there's things that seem so
[1:00:28] large and so important but when you're
[1:00:29] born again all things become new
[1:00:31] when we behold a signpost when we're
[1:00:33] lost we stop we rejoice we settle for a
[1:00:36] moment
[1:00:37] we found it we found it but once we get
[1:00:39] in the path
[1:00:40] we have one goal in mind and one vision
[1:00:42] we say yep thanks for the sign pulse i'm
[1:00:44] on the right path but he said i will not
[1:00:46] stop i will not be deterred
[1:00:47] not stop and stare because on this road
[1:00:50] i must be at jerusalem
[1:00:53] i must make it i cannot stop why i've
[1:00:56] been born again i have a vision i have a
[1:00:57] purpose i have a goal
[1:00:58] i will not stop until i see it
[1:01:02] all things have become new
[1:01:05] he's quoting from some of your favorite
[1:01:07] some of you your favorite
[1:01:08] author walter hilton in the latter the
[1:01:12] scale of perfection i said that jokingly
[1:01:14] probably none of you ever heard of him
[1:01:15] before
[1:01:16] no this is not the hilton
[1:01:19] that owns this building but walter
[1:01:22] hilton said
[1:01:23] what so thou hearest or see us or
[1:01:25] fearless
[1:01:27] that should let thee in the way abide
[1:01:29] not with it willfully
[1:01:30] tarry not for it restfully behold it not
[1:01:33] like and not dread it not but i
[1:01:34] go forth in thy way and think that thou
[1:01:36] would just be at
[1:01:38] jerusalem once you've been born again
[1:01:41] the path is different
[1:01:43] that doesn't mean we don't have familiar
[1:01:44] experiences it doesn't mean we don't go
[1:01:46] through things that we went through
[1:01:47] before
[1:01:48] it's a reminder now that you're now on a
[1:01:50] path where things can
[1:01:52] be different you don't have to take the
[1:01:53] same exits you did before
[1:01:55] you don't have to stop and stare you
[1:01:57] don't have to continually revisit
[1:01:59] oh well is this the time for me to be
[1:02:01] re-baptized again listen
[1:02:03] if you've been born again and sealed
[1:02:04] with the the holy ghost
[1:02:06] there is no need to go back to the water
[1:02:08] zero none
[1:02:09] absolutely none the seal of god
[1:02:13] is what you want if you have it walk in
[1:02:15] it
[1:02:16] don't be bullied and intimidated to get
[1:02:18] wet again believe in the promise
[1:02:20] it only weakens your experience when
[1:02:22] through dread and fear
[1:02:23] and apprehension you're drawn to be
[1:02:24] re-baptized
[1:02:29] if you've got the seal of god and you
[1:02:32] know it
[1:02:33] then it worked right it worked
[1:02:37] it happened all things have become new
[1:02:42] i say let this be your basis for another
[1:02:44] fresh start
[1:02:47] let this be all of us for all of us our
[1:02:48] bases you say well brother and i've been
[1:02:50] born again well then this is
[1:02:51] we're looking at this today saying you
[1:02:52] know what this is i want to have a
[1:02:54] different attitude and mindset a fresh
[1:02:56] start in my faith towards the promises
[1:02:57] of god
[1:02:57] a new outlook on what this new birth
[1:02:59] experience means to me
[1:03:02] let this become the foundation that
[1:03:04] you're looking back to that god did in
[1:03:05] your life where i have been given a
[1:03:07] renewal
[1:03:08] and a reminder that we must be at
[1:03:10] jerusalem
[1:03:11] i've got a place that i'm going i've got
[1:03:13] a path that i'm headed in
[1:03:16] we must be at jerusalem
[1:03:19] i was thinking about this last week i
[1:03:21] believe it was and says
[1:03:24] you know what's wrong with the
[1:03:26] perfectionist
[1:03:27] the perfectionist that's what makes a
[1:03:31] perfectionist imperfect is the
[1:03:33] perfectionist himself
[1:03:36] and and i thought about it this way in
[1:03:38] terms of all of our starts and restarts
[1:03:40] and second chances the problem with all
[1:03:41] of them and all of our clean slates it's
[1:03:44] the same person with the same promise
[1:03:47] and they say that the uh the definition
[1:03:49] of insanity is to keep doing the same
[1:03:51] thing and expecting a different result
[1:03:54] i don't know why i keep getting
[1:03:55] headaches well what are you doing i'm
[1:03:56] banging my head up against this wall
[1:03:58] and the headaches won't go away like
[1:04:00] well um
[1:04:03] if you don't want headaches i don't know
[1:04:06] i'm just guessing here i wouldn't bang
[1:04:07] your head up against the wall
[1:04:09] but what's it saying i'm keep doing it
[1:04:10] and i keep getting headaches there's a
[1:04:12] problem when it's just
[1:04:13] us doing it problem when it's just us
[1:04:16] making the promise
[1:04:20] using we've used the example or made
[1:04:21] reference to a move
[1:04:24] and said well we're moving we're going
[1:04:26] to move into a new house we're moving to
[1:04:27] a new state we're starting all over
[1:04:28] again
[1:04:29] but you bring all the same stuff with
[1:04:30] you
[1:04:32] it's like it's all the same stuff it's
[1:04:35] all the same problems
[1:04:36] all the same clutter all this they got
[1:04:38] the same job we got the same spending
[1:04:40] habits i got the same health
[1:04:41] everything's still the same you just
[1:04:42] drag along all the same problems
[1:04:45] oh what if we could if we're going to
[1:04:47] get somewhere we're going to do this
[1:04:48] listen if i can say this to you as a
[1:04:50] church don't think that we're any less
[1:04:52] of a church or can have any less dynamic
[1:04:54] services
[1:04:55] in the power of god move just because
[1:04:56] we're in a temporal building
[1:04:59] because if we if we kind of say well you
[1:05:01] know it's okay
[1:05:03] but it once we find a church once we get
[1:05:05] an actual building
[1:05:06] the potential is there to actually have
[1:05:08] church
[1:05:09] well i'm not waiting for a new building
[1:05:11] to have church as far as i'm concerned
[1:05:13] the
[1:05:13] have church has really been co-opted by
[1:05:16] a lot of charisma and care
[1:05:17] and fleshly workup i want the word to
[1:05:20] have preeminence
[1:05:21] and he could do that in here
[1:05:24] and so if we could if we built it up in
[1:05:26] our minds that well once we get a new
[1:05:27] building
[1:05:28] then things will be different it won't
[1:05:30] be
[1:05:32] so i said now is the day of salvation
[1:05:34] now is the time now is what we're we
[1:05:36] feel that god has given us an
[1:05:37] opportunity god is on the scene god is
[1:05:39] doing things
[1:05:39] and so we could change church locations
[1:05:42] but we're going to bring all the same
[1:05:43] things with this and it's going to be
[1:05:44] there at the new one
[1:05:48] david clarkson he was a puritan minister
[1:05:51] considered one of the
[1:05:52] rejected or ejected ministers of the
[1:05:54] puritan movement ejected out of
[1:05:56] the church of england in the 1600s he
[1:05:58] takes the scripture therefore if any man
[1:06:00] be in christ he's a new creature
[1:06:01] he says let old things pass away let all
[1:06:04] things become new
[1:06:05] you who brought this world out of
[1:06:07] nothing with the word
[1:06:09] can with the word work in me this new
[1:06:11] creation
[1:06:12] you who brought the world into being
[1:06:15] with your voice
[1:06:16] can do the same thing in me and all my
[1:06:19] chaos and all my disorder
[1:06:20] all suffer me not to perish when you can
[1:06:22] so easily make me happy
[1:06:25] amen suffer me not to be void suffer me
[1:06:27] not to be despondent
[1:06:28] when you can so easily make me happy
[1:06:30] speak the word and it will be done
[1:06:32] just speak the word in this soul now
[1:06:34] dark woeful chaos
[1:06:35] and a lump of corruption and confusion
[1:06:37] would become a new creature
[1:06:40] just speak the word that's the attitude
[1:06:42] we ought to have
[1:06:43] every day of our lives just let the word
[1:06:46] come on the scene
[1:06:46] let the word be spoken over let the word
[1:06:49] have preeminence
[1:06:50] and this soul this woeful chaos this
[1:06:52] lump of corruption and confusion
[1:06:54] will become a new creature
[1:06:57] brother brown says in the message
[1:06:59] absolute and what christians need today
[1:07:01] in this atomic age in this time of
[1:07:03] uncertainty you need
[1:07:04] something be something besides just an
[1:07:07] experience of joining church
[1:07:09] something more than just changing
[1:07:11] locations and changing
[1:07:12] the address something more than just
[1:07:14] joining church you need an anchor an
[1:07:16] absolute
[1:07:17] that you know because churches will fail
[1:07:20] and people will fail
[1:07:21] but christ cannot fail he he's the
[1:07:24] absolute to the believer
[1:07:26] and if christ is your absolute you're
[1:07:27] tied to him and if he's your absolute
[1:07:29] and you're tied to him then you are tied
[1:07:31] to
[1:07:31] the word that's right
[1:07:36] if any man be in christ he is a new
[1:07:38] creature
[1:07:39] oh then let him just speak the word
[1:07:44] it's talking about a new beginning a
[1:07:45] fresh foundation
[1:07:47] this is what a christian needs everyone
[1:07:49] says every christian
[1:07:50] doesn't just need to join church
[1:07:53] and in joining church let's go ahead and
[1:07:55] do all the things we think we know we
[1:07:56] should do in
[1:07:57] church and now things are going to be
[1:07:59] different we just
[1:08:00] we need a foundation a starting place
[1:08:04] we read it in isaiah chapter 43 verses
[1:08:07] 18 and 19 i'll read it again
[1:08:09] remember you not the former things
[1:08:11] neither consider the things of old
[1:08:14] in the context that god it's being used
[1:08:16] here
[1:08:18] because it actually says elsewhere in
[1:08:20] isaiah remember you the former things of
[1:08:21] all
[1:08:22] so here he's saying remember it not in
[1:08:24] this context based upon what god is
[1:08:25] saying he's saying
[1:08:28] what i am going to do is so great
[1:08:32] that you'll forget what i have done
[1:08:34] remember you're not the former things
[1:08:36] neither consider things of old
[1:08:37] don't put me in a box don't try to
[1:08:39] minimize what i can do
[1:08:40] don't use what's happened in the past as
[1:08:42] their basis for expectation
[1:08:44] i will do a new thing based upon what i
[1:08:46] have done
[1:08:47] based upon what i will do what i have
[1:08:49] done before should not
[1:08:50] serve as your ceiling should not serve
[1:08:53] for what you're looking for i'm going to
[1:08:54] be doing something great
[1:08:55] and different and so it indicates
[1:08:59] that verse 19 is referring to something
[1:09:01] unprecedented
[1:09:03] unlike any other experience behold i
[1:09:05] will
[1:09:06] do a new thing now it shall spring forth
[1:09:09] shall you not know it
[1:09:11] i will do a new thing it's something
[1:09:13] that
[1:09:14] he does suddenly now it springs forth
[1:09:18] it's a new beginning it's a fresh start
[1:09:21] i will supernaturally bring newness of
[1:09:23] life
[1:09:24] i will bring growth as a way in the
[1:09:26] wilderness i will bring water
[1:09:27] as streams in the desert and rivers in
[1:09:29] the desert
[1:09:31] i can bring deliverance from self
[1:09:34] i can bring deliverance from the bondage
[1:09:36] of habits which
[1:09:37] you've carried along year after year and
[1:09:40] used in self-destructive cycles
[1:09:42] i'm gonna do a new thing don't look back
[1:09:44] in your life of well i tried and it did
[1:09:46] work i tried and i did work i tried this
[1:09:47] and i didn't
[1:09:48] don't look back anymore in fear of what
[1:09:51] has been
[1:09:52] behold i do a new thing all your bad
[1:09:54] habits all your self-destructive
[1:09:56] tendencies
[1:09:57] i can change in a moment
[1:10:00] i can release you from the despair of
[1:10:02] things just never really able
[1:10:05] to work out things just don't ever work
[1:10:08] out like i wanted them to
[1:10:10] i can't seem to figure it out what
[1:10:11] happens when this oh
[1:10:13] fresh start new beginning this time it's
[1:10:14] going to be different what ends up
[1:10:16] happening
[1:10:17] you stop trying
[1:10:20] can i get an amen you stop trying to get
[1:10:23] paralyzed
[1:10:24] the fear gets so great you know you know
[1:10:26] i'd only want to try next time
[1:10:28] used to try to work it out with my
[1:10:30] spouse but now i don't even try anymore
[1:10:31] you used to want to do this but now i
[1:10:32] don't i just give up i just quit
[1:10:34] you become paralyzed why because our
[1:10:36] lives get littered with so many starts
[1:10:38] and stops
[1:10:40] so many failures so many lost hopes so
[1:10:41] many broken dreams
[1:10:43] that it's built a complex that you're
[1:10:45] afraid to fail
[1:10:46] or a big wall that says not can't do it
[1:10:51] has it just gotten too real
[1:10:55] i know it means something to somebody
[1:10:59] so now it's 11 47 if that means anything
[1:11:03] to anyone
[1:11:04] if you need to pull out your crockpot
[1:11:05] app and take it down the temperature
[1:11:07] down a little bit
[1:11:09] you tell your traeger to go ahead and
[1:11:10] just warm that now might be the time to
[1:11:13] do it because i've got to get to this
[1:11:14] point i've been building to this
[1:11:18] in psalms chapter 55.
[1:11:23] just think about these
[1:11:27] this despair that things just don't work
[1:11:31] out like i want them to
[1:11:32] and because they don't i'm i'm just even
[1:11:34] afraid to try
[1:11:37] this is what the psalmist is describing
[1:11:41] describing a person whose nerves are so
[1:11:43] fragile
[1:11:46] they're unable to hope unable to even
[1:11:49] believe for a fresh start they're just
[1:11:51] you know what this is just the way it's
[1:11:52] going to be
[1:11:54] fearless and trembling are come upon me
[1:11:57] and hath overwhelmed me enveloped
[1:12:00] me
[1:12:01] i've become feeble i've grown weak i've
[1:12:03] been rendered unable
[1:12:06] yet i'm longing for rest
[1:12:09] because he says and i said oh that i had
[1:12:12] wings like a dove
[1:12:14] think about how you can put yourself in
[1:12:15] this person's position i'm anxious i'm
[1:12:18] bound i have complexes i'm fearful i'm
[1:12:20] trembling
[1:12:20] i'm overwhelmed my belly cleaves to the
[1:12:22] earth as it were because my
[1:12:24] soul is so broken and i'm so dried up
[1:12:26] there's no life in me there's no
[1:12:28] vitality and all you have is the ability
[1:12:30] to say i just wish i could fly away from
[1:12:32] here
[1:12:33] just wish i could get away somehow then
[1:12:36] i would fly away and be at rest i'd get
[1:12:38] out of this situation and get out of
[1:12:39] this condition
[1:12:40] and the psalmist is describing someone
[1:12:41] who's just so warned and so
[1:12:43] tired and so weary they can only just
[1:12:46] hope that they could be a bird to fly
[1:12:47] away to a place of rest
[1:12:51] it's this nastiness and this viciousness
[1:12:54] of a need and a desire in our hearts to
[1:12:56] begin again to have a fresh start to
[1:12:58] accomplish something to be successful
[1:13:00] and to constantly be
[1:13:01] met by bitter failure through our own
[1:13:03] human efforts and not find
[1:13:05] that place of rest in christ through new
[1:13:07] birth experience
[1:13:08] or forget that we are resting in that
[1:13:13] i had a dozen statements i wanted to
[1:13:15] read to you from brother brown i'm in
[1:13:16] prayer line
[1:13:17] excuse me i narrowed it down to four i
[1:13:19] believe
[1:13:21] and i i hope this is some
[1:13:25] something heavy hitting for you can we
[1:13:27] all just purpose in our hearts right now
[1:13:29] there's no doubt there's no fear
[1:13:31] there's no we we want to believe for
[1:13:33] somebody
[1:13:34] i i would encourage you to believe for
[1:13:36] yourself what you believe yourself but
[1:13:37] if you can't if you feel that well this
[1:13:39] the direction he's going this is for
[1:13:40] this person this is for that person
[1:13:42] let's believe for the neighbors next
[1:13:43] door let's believe right now let's have
[1:13:46] faith to believe that god
[1:13:47] god's speaking to someone's heart who
[1:13:49] needs this who wants to hear from god
[1:13:51] billy bradham and the message be certain
[1:13:53] of god we may have read this uh last
[1:13:55] year at one point
[1:13:57] and when i say last year
[1:14:01] he says he's in a prayer line and a
[1:14:02] young man comes and says young man you
[1:14:04] are nervous and upset
[1:14:06] don't you know that god can heal nerves
[1:14:09] and in a dozen different statements that
[1:14:11] i that i had
[1:14:13] put in my notes to use brother branham
[1:14:15] identifies
[1:14:16] stomach problems and ulcers and peptic
[1:14:19] conditions
[1:14:20] and bodily functions being impaired he
[1:14:22] says it's just nervousness
[1:14:24] it's just nerves you just keep getting
[1:14:26] worked out
[1:14:27] and science will tell you doctors will
[1:14:28] tell you when they're trying to diagnose
[1:14:30] whether what something's wrong in your
[1:14:31] your gastrointestinal system and say are
[1:14:34] you nervous are you going through
[1:14:35] difficulty there's a problem is there
[1:14:36] something
[1:14:37] because why because the body can respond
[1:14:39] in that way
[1:14:40] you get you um people when they get
[1:14:42] under pressure and they're a difficult
[1:14:43] situation they can just get heartburn
[1:14:45] they say why do you have to eat some
[1:14:46] spicy you know i'm just nervous and
[1:14:48] brother adam says this he says do you
[1:14:50] know that god can heal nerves well we
[1:14:51] know we can heal a belly
[1:14:53] but he can heal a belly only for it to
[1:14:55] get nervous again
[1:14:56] so he said you know god can heal nerves
[1:14:58] it's hard for a nervous person to get a
[1:15:00] hold of it
[1:15:02] brother says the hardest thing in the
[1:15:04] world you've been wanting a place to
[1:15:08] place your foot you've been wanting to
[1:15:11] find a nail
[1:15:13] some solid footing you're a great
[1:15:15] thinker crossing bridges before you get
[1:15:17] to it
[1:15:18] and taking other things don't do it no
[1:15:21] more
[1:15:22] you don't feel bad now see it's off you
[1:15:24] now if you'll go believing it'll never
[1:15:26] come on you again
[1:15:27] in the name of jesus christ believe it
[1:15:32] what was the what was it the problem
[1:15:34] with this egg he's a deep thinker
[1:15:36] already running through the progressions
[1:15:38] already working out the scenarios always
[1:15:40] a few steps ahead
[1:15:41] well if i do this then this should
[1:15:42] happen that should happen well then this
[1:15:44] is going to happen this is going to
[1:15:45] happen and so they just work it all out
[1:15:46] in their minds
[1:15:47] and what happens when the bridge isn't
[1:15:48] there when you get there
[1:15:50] you're already on the other side you're
[1:15:51] marooned on an island emotionally you're
[1:15:53] stranded
[1:15:54] and you get nervous how do i get to
[1:15:56] myself i'm over there i've already done
[1:15:57] this i've already
[1:15:58] this has already happened i don't know
[1:16:00] what to do and it causes this turmoil
[1:16:01] and says
[1:16:02] you're a nervous person he says you just
[1:16:03] want a solid place to stand
[1:16:06] you want a fresh start he says in
[1:16:08] another sermon
[1:16:10] to a sister in a prayer line awful

[1:16:21] that makes you feel like everything's
[1:16:22] wrong like a black bolt comes from you
[1:16:25] like a cloud or something that wave
[1:16:28] that's waves like a breathe breath

[1:16:32] evening times when the sun is sinking

[1:19:58] from right here
[1:20:01] lord in the name of jesus christ this
[1:20:03] shadow of darkness like a mist hanging
[1:20:05] at that woman
[1:20:06] in the name of jesus christ demon of
[1:20:08] nervousness nervousness
[1:20:09] leave the woman a now amen now go and
[1:20:11] rejoice look
[1:20:12] be happy just rejoice and thank god
[1:20:15] it'll stay away from you
[1:20:17] just believe it not that the old stab
[1:20:20] and the old
[1:20:20] bittersweet won't visit you often but it
[1:20:23] won't mean as much
[1:20:25] as it did before it won't be as of great
[1:20:27] importance
[1:20:28] as it was before it won't be this fear
[1:20:30] in this foreboding oh
[1:20:32] it could be this what it could be that
[1:20:34] then it gets worse and it gets worse and
[1:20:35] it gets worse when you say
[1:20:36] starting right now i've placed my foot
[1:20:39] upon the shore
[1:20:40] immediately i'm at the bank where i was
[1:20:43] going and from this moment on i'm
[1:20:44] walking on solid
[1:20:46] ground i will no longer be tossed about
[1:20:48] in the tempest of these storms that are
[1:20:49] raging about me
[1:20:50] now i believe now i believe now is my
[1:20:54] footsteps
[1:20:57] he says oh i can make it go away from
[1:20:59] you right now but it'll come back
[1:21:02] unless you've found that place where
[1:21:03] your faith can rest
[1:21:06] we're not just in the in the mode of
[1:21:08] driving things away so that these come
[1:21:09] right back
[1:21:10] but driving them away to the point where
[1:21:12] you can make your step
[1:21:15] the preaching of the lord every time the
[1:21:16] word is preached is an opportunity for a
[1:21:18] fresh start
[1:21:20] somewhere somehow in your life it's an
[1:21:21] opportunity to say be it unto me
[1:21:23] according that word i take it
[1:21:24] that's for me i'm going forward
[1:21:28] for it says in galatians chapter 6 verse
[1:21:30] 15
[1:21:31] for in christ jesus neither circumcision
[1:21:34] availeth anything
[1:21:36] that would be to be strong in body to be
[1:21:37] robust to be in sound health
[1:21:39] circumcision nor uncircumcision
[1:21:42] causes strong health i can make him
[1:21:44] leave you
[1:21:46] we could cast him away we could do some
[1:21:47] work in the move of the spirit
[1:21:49] that can do something within your body
[1:21:50] or within your mind but he's saying
[1:21:52] what you really need is a new creature
[1:21:56] in christ jesus what avails what makes a
[1:21:59] difference what gives
[1:22:00] health and soundness of mind is a new
[1:22:04] creature we need god to do a new thing
[1:22:10] whether it be healing salvation
[1:22:11] deliverance whether it be restoration
[1:22:14] on some level
[1:22:17] even in terms of
[1:22:20] relationships that just aren't where
[1:22:22] they need to be
[1:22:24] he god can bring you to a place to start
[1:22:28] anew
[1:22:30] he could bring you to a place to start
[1:22:31] fresh
[1:22:33] brother brandon talking about repentance
[1:22:35] he says repent means to turn around and
[1:22:36] go back
[1:22:37] you miss the mark start over again
[1:22:41] he said what is it going to take by
[1:22:42] there to start over just say i'm sorry
[1:22:45] just say just ask for forgiveness to
[1:22:46] repent he says repent turn around go
[1:22:48] back you miss the mark i'm sorry
[1:22:50] you start over again
[1:22:53] it's a place to start fresh
[1:22:58] this may have been the one that i
[1:23:00] referred to earlier that i might have
[1:23:01] read before but
[1:23:02] brother branham again with in a prayer
[1:23:04] line a young man standing before him
[1:23:05] says nervousness is an awful thing
[1:23:07] hurts causes all kinds of troubles and
[1:23:10] everything
[1:23:11] but god can heal nervousness
[1:23:15] says you believe that you're a deep
[1:23:17] thinker son
[1:23:19] you're one of these types of people
[1:23:21] that's crossing bridges before you get
[1:23:22] to them taking other things
[1:23:24] it never happens the way you think it
[1:23:26] out anyhow
[1:23:28] you've always wanted a place to set your
[1:23:31] foot so you could start you've long
[1:23:32] defined that place
[1:23:34] that's right can any of us relate to
[1:23:37] what this man would be going through
[1:23:40] everything i've tried everything i've
[1:23:42] done every moment where i thought would
[1:23:43] get better and if i just did this this
[1:23:44] would happen if i just got married this
[1:23:46] would happen
[1:23:46] if i just moved this would happen if i
[1:23:48] just did this this would happen all oh
[1:23:50] if i could just change professions all
[1:23:51] these things that we start figuring out
[1:23:53] in our mind oh this this this this this
[1:23:55] it'll just get better
[1:23:56] and brother bam is discerning this
[1:23:57] within his heart he says you've always
[1:23:58] wanted it you've always longed for it
[1:24:00] and you're such a deep thinker you've
[1:24:01] thought through everything you've
[1:24:02] analyzed you processed your mind would
[1:24:04] ever let you rest
[1:24:05] and it's caused so many troubles in your
[1:24:07] life because you're always crossing
[1:24:09] bridges you're always making assumptions
[1:24:11] you're always letting
[1:24:12] your negative emotions get ahead of you
[1:24:14] and just drag you around it must have
[1:24:16] been an
[1:24:16] awful life and he says you just want a
[1:24:20] place
[1:24:21] where you can get up you want a place as
[1:24:25] ezra said you gave us some breathing
[1:24:26] room

[1:24:31] i've been born again
[1:24:33] i feel like this is new i i feel like
[1:24:35] this is an opportunity
[1:24:36] i just want a place i can set my foot
[1:24:38] i've longed to find that place he says
[1:24:41] you're on that ground right now son
[1:24:45] you're right at that place right now
[1:24:48] he says you never want to come up to
[1:24:49] manhood a neurotic and weary and upside
[1:24:51] down you're too nice of a young man to
[1:24:53] do that
[1:24:54] the shadow now hung over you a few
[1:24:56] moments ago has left
[1:24:58] you i don't know what's happened but
[1:24:59] it's gone from you
[1:25:01] your faith is taking it away
[1:25:04] now you're free from your trouble
[1:25:08] now i want to say to all of us today
[1:25:12] you're on that ground
[1:25:14] now right now
[1:25:17] you're on that ground a place to start
[1:25:21] fresh
[1:25:22] that's what this if it's even this
[1:25:24] service it's what i want to mean to
[1:25:26] every single one of you that today if it
[1:25:28] has to be
[1:25:29] something within our minds to drive away
[1:25:31] clouds and to drive away doubt to drive
[1:25:33] away fear today
[1:25:34] i'm driving down a stake today i'm
[1:25:36] putting a pin in my experience
[1:25:38] i'm anchoring today today lord you do a
[1:25:40] new thing

[1:25:57] thus in our nine enders and all these
[1:25:59] different things we could look at in the
[1:26:00] natural but now
[1:26:01] for me in my heart today i'm on this
[1:26:04] ground
[1:26:06] i've always wanted to find a place where
[1:26:07] i could get place my foot
[1:26:09] a solid place a place where if you're
[1:26:11] going to make a leap
[1:26:13] you're going to jump if you're going to
[1:26:14] do something you want to steady yourself

[1:26:17] up against is solid will this support me
[1:26:19] will it hold my weight is this secure is
[1:26:21] this a point of departure where i could
[1:26:23] jump from
[1:26:24] is this trustworthy can i do this this
[1:26:26] is what someone's wanting
[1:26:27] i just want to dive right in i want to
[1:26:29] jump i i want to go and he's saying
[1:26:30] you're on that ground now come
[1:26:32] i'll catch you you found the foot and
[1:26:35] you found the place

[1:26:48] and rivers in the desert
[1:26:51] shall you not know it will be such a
[1:26:52] transformation that you will know
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:26:59] let this be the place
[1:27:05] this is your footstep
[1:27:08] start from right here you're on that
[1:27:12] ground
[1:27:13] now let today be a day
[1:27:18] that you found a place for a fresh start
[1:27:24] let this church be a place
[1:27:28] where someone else can have a fresh
[1:27:30] start
[1:27:32] a place where the lord is doing a new
[1:27:33] thing
[1:27:35] a place for new beginnings
[1:27:38] where we could have the kind of spirit
[1:27:39] in the kind of nature that
[1:27:42] we see somebody come in to visit church
[1:27:45] and we're not quick to go
[1:27:46] oh i better let brother aaron know about
[1:27:49] them
[1:27:50] so he knows all their history and what
[1:27:52] they've done and this and that
[1:27:54] and the other how about we just take a
[1:27:56] step back and say lord
[1:27:58] this time this is their footstep
[1:28:02] amen they're never going to be the same
[1:28:05] again
[1:28:06] and just start expecting it i don't even
[1:28:07] know this person
[1:28:09] i don't even know who they are why
[1:28:11] because they're going to be different
[1:28:13] word is going to transform them the
[1:28:15] power of god is going to move it's not
[1:28:17] going to be the same
[1:28:18] pretense and politics it's not the same
[1:28:21] church experience
[1:28:22] i found a place to start over and i
[1:28:24] believe they can too
[1:28:26] can that be the what we the the nature
[1:28:29] that we have and the nurture that we
[1:28:30] give
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:33] everybody is seated right now
[1:28:36] but i'm going to ask you to stand and
[1:28:37] when you do
[1:28:39] it's a place to start fresh
[1:28:44] let's stand a place to set your foot
[1:28:48] to begin again
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:54] with heads bowed
[1:29:00] the lord dealt with my heart very
[1:29:02] heavily about
[1:29:05] nerves and nervousness
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:09] how problematic it gets
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:20] you have to be careful to not become
[1:29:21] over simplistic when it comes to nerves
[1:29:23] and nervousness and emotional issues and
[1:29:26] depression and anxiety and fear
[1:29:31] so i don't say this in any way to try to
[1:29:33] sum it all up but
[1:29:38] to be nervous and to your nerves to be
[1:29:40] bothering you
[1:29:42] it's that way because there's no clear
[1:29:44] explanation
[1:29:46] it's that way because things often don't
[1:29:48] make sense if you had a problem and you
[1:29:52] went to the doctor and they ran a test
[1:29:54] said oh it's easy you're allergic to
[1:29:55] oxygen then you would just leave at
[1:29:57] least knowing
[1:29:58] well that's my problem i'm allergic to
[1:30:00] oxygen and we know how to go about it
[1:30:02] but it's when
[1:30:03] things don't match up things aren't
[1:30:04] making sense things are going wrong and
[1:30:06] i've tried this and i've tried that and
[1:30:07] why do we always find ourselves
[1:30:08] in the same situation again and all this
[1:30:11] anxiety and fear and oppression and
[1:30:13] nervousness begins to build and we get
[1:30:14] these complexes
[1:30:18] god was dealing with me so much on that
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:23] and i thought about that a person our
[1:30:26] neighbors in the apartment next to us
[1:30:27] who suffer from depression
[1:30:30] because they're so depressed they don't
[1:30:31] do laundry they don't do the dishes they
[1:30:34] don't take care of themselves they don't
[1:30:35] wash their hair and their lives just get
[1:30:38] cluttered
[1:30:39] and messy and they fall so far behind in
[1:30:41] responsibilities
[1:30:43] things that they should do and all of a
[1:30:45] sudden one day they wake up
[1:30:48] and they make their bed they clean their
[1:30:51] room
[1:30:52] and next thing you know they're proud of
[1:30:53] themselves because they look back at the
[1:30:55] end of the day and they're like
[1:30:56] i cleaned my house i did laundry i
[1:30:58] washed the dishes
[1:30:59] look look everything's neat everything's
[1:31:02] clean look i hadn't done it in months i
[1:31:04] hadn't done it weeks but look what was
[1:31:05] that
[1:31:06] they felt something a fresh start
[1:31:10] if we could relate to that in a natural
[1:31:12] if we could relate to that to people who
[1:31:14] struggle with that
[1:31:15] in natural life
[1:31:18] i'm wanting you to know that there's a
[1:31:19] place that you could stand as a believer
[1:31:21] that you can have a confidence and
[1:31:23] assurance
[1:31:23] that from this day forward life
[1:31:27] is different just as c.s lewis could say
[1:31:31] you know
[1:31:32] what about joy well i find out now it
[1:31:35] didn't mean as much to me as it
[1:31:37] did when i was in the world and i can't
[1:31:39] complain like the other poets do
[1:31:42] but i know that all those experiences in
[1:31:44] the past were pointing me to this
[1:31:45] blessed state and experience that i have
[1:31:47] now
[1:31:48] that those things never quite had the
[1:31:50] importance that i once gave it
[1:31:51] they were only pointing to the dissolver
[1:31:54] of doubts the resolver of all situations
[1:31:56] the comforter the god that could give me
[1:31:58] newness of life and what i have found
[1:32:00] now
[1:32:01] i am on a road that i cannot stop and
[1:32:03] stare i'm on a road where i do not have
[1:32:05] time
[1:32:06] to to worry i'm on a road where i don't
[1:32:07] have time to build bridges
[1:32:09] i just trust them when i come to him
[1:32:11] because i must be in jerusalem
[1:32:14] and say today lord i'm driving down a
[1:32:15] stake today i'm putting another anchor
[1:32:18] in the side of this mountain
[1:32:19] i must be at jerusalem today i'm
[1:32:21] starting with the fresh seal
[1:32:23] and the renewing and refilling
[1:32:28] our heavenly father i pray for these
[1:32:32] saints these longing souls
[1:32:35] these young married couples these new
[1:32:36] families
[1:32:39] these battle-worn veterans
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:43] these physically
[1:32:47] weary soldiers of the cross
[1:32:52] the mentally worn believers
[1:32:58] i pray today that you give them as you
[1:33:00] did ezra
[1:33:01] that moment where he felt like he could
[1:33:03] breathe again
[1:33:05] it felt like the decades and generations
[1:33:07] of sin had somehow been swept aside and
[1:33:09] now
[1:33:10] god was saying i'm doing something new
[1:33:14] and he could breathe again and though he
[1:33:16] was a blessing prophet and he was honest
[1:33:18] and he's repenting it's what
[1:33:20] gave him this real sense of renewal now
[1:33:22] lord you can give us a nail
[1:33:24] a nail in your holy place and i pray
[1:33:26] that for all those who are present now
[1:33:28] that you could give them a nail in your
[1:33:30] holy place
[1:33:31] give them a solid footing an anchor lord
[1:33:35] they would never fear worry again
[1:33:38] trusting to that unseen hand
[1:33:42] i pray lord that we can leave from here
[1:33:46] feeling sensing knowing and believing
[1:33:49] i found that footstep
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] i've searched i've searched i've longed
[1:33:54] i've longed i've wanted i've wanted
[1:33:55] today i found it that place
[1:34:00] put my foot and i put both feet on it
[1:34:04] i'm not afraid i'm not just testing and
[1:34:06] one foot in the boat and one foot on the
[1:34:08] water i'm all in lord
[1:34:10] i'm jumping in lord i'm just diving into
[1:34:14] this lord with everything that's in me
[1:34:16] because i'm new i'm born again i feel
[1:34:18] free i feel delivered and this time i'm
[1:34:20] trusting to you not myself
[1:34:22] lord the perfectionist in me has kept me
[1:34:25] imperfect my entire life
[1:34:27] my obsessions my compulsions have kept
[1:34:29] me from accomplishments that now today
[1:34:32] lord i come to you
[1:34:34] and i feel that i have been lifted up by
[1:34:37] a dove
[1:34:38] who's carrying me to a place of rest
[1:34:42] heart is overwhelmed you've led me to a
[1:34:44] rock
[1:34:46] that is higher than i bless your people
[1:34:48] i pray in jesus name
[1:34:51] amen
