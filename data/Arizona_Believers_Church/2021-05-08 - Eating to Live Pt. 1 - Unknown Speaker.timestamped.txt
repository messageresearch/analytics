[0:00] exodus chapter 12
[0:03] beginning with verse 7 and we'll read to
[0:06] verse 14.
[0:10] and they shall take the blood of the
[0:12] blood and strike it on the two side post
[0:14] and on the upper door post of the houses
[0:17] wherein
[0:18] they shall eat it and what they're
[0:20] eating is the lamb
[0:21] that's referred to beginning in verse 3
[0:25] and it says and they shall eat the flesh
[0:27] in that night
[0:28] roast with fire and unleavened bread and
[0:31] with bitter herbs
[0:32] they shall eat it so god is being very
[0:34] specific
[0:35] about how it must be prepared and how
[0:37] that it must be partaking
[0:39] in eat not of it raw nor sodden at all
[0:42] with water but roast with fire
[0:44] his head with his legs and with the
[0:45] pertinence thereof and you shall not let
[0:48] nothing of it remain until the morning
[0:50] and that which remaineth of it until the
[0:51] morning ye shall
[0:52] burn with fire and thus shall you eat
[0:56] it with your loins girded your shoes on
[0:58] your feet and your staff in your hand
[1:00] and ye shall eat it in haste
[1:02] it is the lord's passover for i will
[1:04] pass through the land of egypt this
[1:06] night and i will smite all the firstborn
[1:08] in the land of egypt both man and beast
[1:11] and against
[1:12] all the gods of egypt i will execute
[1:14] judgment i am the lord
[1:16] and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:17] token upon the houses where you are and
[1:19] when i see the blood i will pass over
[1:21] you
[1:21] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[1:23] destroy you when i smite the land of
[1:25] egypt
[1:26] and this day shall be unto you for
[1:28] memorial and you shall keep it a
[1:30] feast to the lord throughout your
[1:32] generations you shall keep it a feast
[1:34] by an ordinance forever if we could bow
[1:37] our heads
[1:38] in prayer our gracious heavenly father
[1:40] as we have read
[1:41] of these striking verses in the exodus
[1:45] of how you gave these specific details
[1:47] to moses
[1:48] about the passover meal lord it's even
[1:51] remarkable now
[1:53] as i ponder it that we have just read
[1:55] what you said
[1:57] hundreds of years ago and were able to
[2:00] bow our heads and speak to the god that
[2:02] spoke to moses
[2:04] and to know that you likewise could
[2:07] speak to us
[2:08] and quicken things to us and instruct us
[2:11] give us the same faith and encouragement
[2:13] that they received through these words
[2:14] in exodus 12 we could receive
[2:16] what is relevant for our day lord it's
[2:19] just an overwhelming thought
[2:21] to know that we're bowing our heads and
[2:22] our hearts and speaking face to face to
[2:24] you
[2:25] having read your word and we ask that
[2:27] you'd come now take it
[2:28] rightly divide it to our hearts as we
[2:31] have open hearts to receive from you
[2:33] may you come and penetrate past anything
[2:36] that would hinder any
[2:37] idea or thought that would stand in the
[2:39] way and may you just take control of the
[2:40] service for your glory
[2:42] be with the several lord that are out
[2:44] sick and inflicted in body and
[2:46] scheduling conflicts lord or whatever it
[2:48] might be we pray that you touch them and
[2:50] strengthen them
[2:51] for those who would be able to listen to
[2:54] this
[2:54] uh where they are and not able to be
[2:56] here may they receive a special blessing
[2:58] tonight our prayers are with them
[3:00] we ask this in the name of the lord
[3:01] jesus christ amen you make me may be
[3:04] seated
[3:08] i've taken for a thought eating to live
[3:13] and my i'll say it in the outset
[3:16] so that you could kind of hold this in
[3:18] your thought as we go forward
[3:20] i really in taking these these subjects
[3:23] on
[3:23] being hungry and feeding and are you
[3:25] being fed and those different things
[3:27] i'm really wanting to highlight and
[3:29] emphasize
[3:30] our appetite for the word and
[3:33] hopefully encourage a greater
[3:35] participation in the message
[3:37] we have available to us sermons that we
[3:40] can read and
[3:41] that we can listen to and there's a
[3:43] message that we can be digesting in our
[3:45] personal lives
[3:46] and i would hope that we not just become
[3:49] faithful church members or faithful to
[3:52] participate in worship
[3:53] and faithful to attend church services
[3:56] but
[3:57] it would uh the kind of the outflow from
[4:00] our participation in church services
[4:02] and the benefit that we are deriving
[4:04] from our fellowship around the word
[4:06] is that we have a greater appetite for
[4:08] the things of god and we find ourselves
[4:10] wanting to
[4:11] listen to the message more and feed on
[4:13] it and take advantage of the opportunity
[4:15] we have to hear that voice
[4:16] and to know what has been brought to us
[4:19] in this hour so
[4:20] we don't want to just become good church
[4:22] members and become very diligent to
[4:23] observe church order
[4:25] we want kind of the product of our
[4:27] gatherings together to be
[4:28] to feed that hunger that we have and
[4:30] create a greater appetite
[4:31] for the message of the hour and i i want
[4:35] to
[4:35] go quickly to exodus chapter 12 just to
[4:38] make a few statements in the outset
[4:39] because
[4:41] i've just purposed in my heart to relax
[4:43] before the lord and before you all
[4:45] tonight
[4:46] in order to just follow the leadership
[4:48] of the lord
[4:49] and say the things that would be his
[4:51] desire to speak to you
[4:53] and so it's very possible that we may
[4:55] not have time to get
[4:56] to this scripture in the end so i want
[4:59] to make a few statements
[5:00] here at the outset that in exodus
[5:03] chapter 12 it begins with it saying the
[5:05] lord spake unto moses
[5:07] and as begins to speak unto them he says
[5:09] that you should take a lamb
[5:11] and it's going to be according to the
[5:13] eating shall you make account for your
[5:15] lamb
[5:15] so the lamb was to be taken to be eaten
[5:19] and this lamb represents something it
[5:20] has great representation
[5:22] great symbolism great foreshadowing of
[5:24] christ
[5:25] and then as god begins to speak to moses
[5:28] about these instructions
[5:29] to take a lamb of a particular age and
[5:31] without blemish and you're going to eat
[5:32] this lamb
[5:34] they were not given the option of how
[5:35] would you like it cooked i i like my
[5:38] lamb rare please with some with some
[5:40] mint or
[5:41] it was you had to just take it just
[5:43] exactly the way that he had to
[5:45] um that god said to do it and then also
[5:48] it wasn't just a matter of well you have
[5:49] to cook it this way you had to eat all
[5:51] of it
[5:52] and then it wasn't just a matter of
[5:53] cooking a particular way and eating all
[5:55] of it you had to be dressed a particular
[5:56] way when you did it
[5:57] and if you want to just take it further
[5:59] all these great details the blood of
[6:01] that lamb that you're eating had to be
[6:03] on display on the outside and the bread
[6:05] that you would eat
[6:06] could not have any leaven and not only
[6:07] could the bread not have leaven but the
[6:09] house could not have leaven
[6:10] and so there's a lot of details and very
[6:12] rich details to this but it all
[6:14] revolves around this meal that was taken
[6:17] that night
[6:18] in a time of death coming upon the land
[6:21] and then in verse 21 it says and moses
[6:23] called for the elders and he began to
[6:25] speak unto them saying draw out a lamb
[6:27] according to your families
[6:28] and then begins to describe and share
[6:30] with the children of israel everything
[6:32] that god had shared with him
[6:34] so we have this in in mind that this is
[6:36] an exodus
[6:37] in a time of death in a time of trouble
[6:40] god gives the prophet
[6:41] a message and the message relates to
[6:43] taking of elements of bread and lamb and
[6:46] eating it in a certain energy that was
[6:49] a feeling and emotion that they would be
[6:51] having they eat in haste and eat with
[6:53] urgency
[6:54] and then it's moses takes this message
[6:56] and he shares it with the children of
[6:58] israel
[6:59] and and this is where we get my thought
[7:00] of eating to live
[7:02] they had to eat this they had to partake
[7:04] in this in order to live that night
[7:07] now i'm just going to pick right up
[7:08] where we left off last wednesday in
[7:10] isaiah chapter 55
[7:11] verse 2 right in the middle of the verse
[7:14] it says hearken diligently unto me
[7:16] and ee that which is good and let your
[7:19] soul delight itself
[7:20] in fatness and so this listen to him
[7:23] follow his precepts hear his voice
[7:25] listen to his word and if you could
[7:27] follow his direction then what you eat
[7:29] will satisfy
[7:30] you won't be spending your energy and
[7:32] labor and money and
[7:34] on things that do not satisfy and things
[7:35] that are not bred but hearken diligently
[7:37] unto me
[7:38] eat that which is good let your soul
[7:40] delight
[7:41] itself in fatness so we're talking about
[7:44] uh this has been the subject of
[7:46] satisfying our souls and satisfying the
[7:49] hunger of our soul
[7:50] and the need for the word during a time
[7:52] of famine because we are living in a
[7:54] time where there is a spiritual famine
[7:56] we live in a time where there's a
[7:57] spiritual
[7:58] shortage of the word of god you uh let's
[8:00] just be honest we don't find it
[8:02] everywhere
[8:03] when we go about our days unless we make
[8:05] an effort to hear the word of god
[8:07] you're probably not going to be hearing
[8:08] the word of god unless you make an
[8:09] effort to discern
[8:11] the finger the the hand of god and the
[8:13] thoughts of god and the creation of god
[8:15] you're not going to see it because how
[8:17] many times do we
[8:18] enjoy the the creation that we live in
[8:21] and whether it be the beautiful weather
[8:22] or even like the meteor shower that was
[8:24] taking place early this morning
[8:26] and the different things and you enjoy
[8:27] it it's beautiful it's great you see the
[8:29] mountains and you see certain things in
[8:30] god's creation
[8:32] yet our instinct isn't to think isn't
[8:33] god grand
[8:35] isn't god wonderful if you're not
[8:37] diligent to pick up on these things
[8:39] you're not in tune with the things of
[8:41] god you're not hearing the word of god
[8:43] and so there is a famine for the word of
[8:45] god and we're bringing that from
[8:46] amos chapter 8 verse 11 where the lord
[8:49] said i will send a famine in the land
[8:51] but it won't be a famine for bread or a
[8:53] famine of water where there's no water
[8:55] to drink or bread to eat but it will be
[8:57] a famine of hearing the words of the
[9:00] lord
[9:01] and so brother branham as we'll read
[9:03] here in a moment
[9:05] he he takes this and places it in the
[9:06] time that we're living in now
[9:08] but in both isaiah chapter 55 and then
[9:11] amos chapter 8
[9:12] it's taking our natural action of eating
[9:15] our natural action of hunger and then
[9:17] satisfying that hunger
[9:18] and then using it to kind of prick our
[9:20] thoughts about our appetite of god for
[9:22] god and his word
[9:24] and so he's taking here in amos chapter
[9:26] 8 is taking man's need
[9:29] for the word as he says it's going to be
[9:30] a famine for hearing of the word and put
[9:32] it in terms
[9:33] of natural natural things and nutrition
[9:36] or natural nutrition maybe is the best
[9:37] way of saying it
[9:38] taking things of bread in water that
[9:40] would be used to
[9:43] give health and strength to the body he
[9:45] said there's going to be a famine for
[9:46] hearing of the word
[9:48] so we can draw from this lessons
[9:51] regarding a spiritual appetite
[9:53] we can draw from this as the word is
[9:54] saying hey it's going to be a famine but
[9:56] maybe not a famine for bread and water
[9:58] but
[9:58] likewise as a famine of bread and water
[10:00] would impact your physical health
[10:02] there's a famine of hearing the word
[10:04] which speaks to us about
[10:06] the realm of a spiritual appetite and
[10:08] spiritual health
[10:09] and brother braham says in spiritual
[10:11] food and due season and that day
[10:12] is now he takes amos chapter 8 verse 11
[10:14] says that day is now
[10:16] hearing the true word of god so live it
[10:18] in a time where there is a famine for
[10:20] hearing the true word of god he says now
[10:22] this types the natural drought with the
[10:24] spiritual
[10:27] sin and unbelief by false teachers and
[10:29] modernists in the church
[10:30] have brought the place to this coming
[10:33] oncoming judgment so
[10:34] he places us firmly within amos chapter
[10:36] 8 verse 11 that there is a famine for
[10:38] hearing of the word of the lord
[10:40] and he says that the natural drought is
[10:42] a type of the spiritual drought that's
[10:44] in
[10:45] in laodicea and he uses this phrase sin
[10:47] and unbelief by false teachers and
[10:49] modernists in the church
[10:51] and and i want you to hold that kind of
[10:52] thought that description
[10:54] it kind of reminds me of lewd fellows of
[10:56] the baser sort brother iran's going to
[10:57] say false teachers and modernists we
[10:59] want to remember that
[11:00] that phrasing false teachers and
[11:01] modernists have brought it to this place
[11:03] of oncoming judgment
[11:05] this is what they've done they have
[11:06] turned from god's word and his prophet
[11:09] to to modern theological terms of the
[11:12] word
[11:13] and in spiritual food and due season
[11:14] brother brahms pointing to malachi 4
[11:16] chapter 5
[11:17] or malachi chapter 4 verse 5. he's
[11:19] pointing to elijah
[11:20] as this type of how there's a famine in
[11:22] laodicea but there's something to come
[11:24] that's going to feed him so he's saying
[11:25] they turned from god's word and his
[11:27] prophet to a modern
[11:29] theological terms of the word this is
[11:31] what the false teachers and modernists
[11:32] have done
[11:33] is they've turned from the word to
[11:35] modern theological terms of the word
[11:38] and then he says this and this kind of
[11:39] becomes the turning of all this
[11:41] you notice here it's just at that time
[11:43] that god always raises up something
[11:45] just when there's a famine just when
[11:47] there's a drought just when false
[11:48] teachers and modernists begin to take
[11:50] advantage of things and twist things
[11:51] and turn from the word god raises up
[11:54] something raises up something for what
[11:56] for the bride's spiritual health there's
[11:58] got to be something made available
[12:01] to to feed the bride and i believe that
[12:03] we have to have the kind of attitude
[12:05] that as long as you have breath god has
[12:07] provided food
[12:09] you're the bride and as long as we're
[12:10] here there's got to be something here to
[12:12] feed you and sustain you
[12:14] and so these modernist and these modern
[12:16] theological terms
[12:18] that they come up with create a shortage
[12:20] of the pure word of god
[12:22] these modernists and these theological
[12:24] terms create a lacking
[12:26] for the pure word so it's man's
[12:28] intervention
[12:29] it's it's not that god has not provided
[12:32] it but yet man's
[12:33] intervention and man's tweaking with it
[12:35] man's interpreting it and man's
[12:36] philosophies and his traditions actually
[12:39] create
[12:40] a shortage and withhold the pure word of
[12:42] god from the people
[12:44] and in mark chapter 7 verse 13 he's
[12:47] jesus in his rebuke
[12:49] of these jewish elders and these
[12:51] teachers he says you're making
[12:52] the word of god of none effect and i
[12:54] know he's speaking very
[12:56] into a very particular thing he says
[12:58] make him the word of god of none effect
[13:00] through your tradition which he have
[13:01] delivered and many such like things
[13:04] do ye so they have made the word of god
[13:07] without
[13:07] effect they have made the word of god
[13:09] without uh with life without
[13:11] force without benefit without proper
[13:14] application and they've done it through
[13:15] their tradition
[13:16] which they have delivered so when they
[13:19] when they took their traditions and
[13:21] joined it with the word
[13:22] the word lost something in its
[13:24] application when they built their when
[13:25] they built tradition around it when they
[13:27] added their old history to it they made
[13:29] the word of god
[13:30] of no effect through the traditions that
[13:33] they delivered it says and many such
[13:34] like things do yes so it wasn't just in
[13:36] this one particular instance
[13:37] but over and over and over again the
[13:39] word that god had delivered had been
[13:41] rendered useless
[13:42] through their traditions and this is
[13:45] where
[13:47] the thought can just expand into
[13:50] an image that is very very large and i
[13:52] just kind of want to point to it say see
[13:53] this
[13:53] this is this is something here that you
[13:55] could ponder and think about in greater
[13:57] detail
[13:58] but once they hybrid once through
[14:01] hybriding
[14:02] the word and hybriding god's
[14:04] commandments it lost its force
[14:07] so through hybriding the word it lost
[14:09] its force it lost its authority it lost
[14:11] its effect its impact
[14:13] and so we could say this about the the
[14:16] things that the jews were observing is
[14:18] these were genetically modified
[14:20] organisms and we all what do we all look
[14:23] for and over
[14:23] pay for non-gmo right that's what we
[14:26] want to buy we want it organic
[14:27] we want to be sure that the rain was
[14:29] organic we won't be sure the soil was
[14:30] organic we want to be sure that there
[14:31] was nothing unorganic within 50 miles
[14:33] because really if you wanted non-gmo you
[14:36] need to make sure that everything within
[14:37] a particular radius probably isn't
[14:38] either right
[14:39] be sure the rain didn't pass over you
[14:41] know the wrong kind of bodies of water
[14:43] but this is this is something maybe we
[14:44] could all understand
[14:46] this is what the jews had done to the
[14:47] word of god they had modified it through
[14:49] their
[14:49] man's ideas and man's inventions and
[14:51] man's intervention
[14:53] and so they had their own science they'd
[14:56] become their own scientists and they'd
[14:57] come up with these concoctions
[14:58] and they had genetically modified the
[15:00] word of god and they'd used their
[15:02] traditions and added this and added that
[15:03] and added their interpretations
[15:05] and once you hybrid it it took the life
[15:08] and the value and the nutrients and what
[15:10] was beneficial
[15:12] in that word they had made it of none
[15:13] effect so see there i'm not preaching
[15:16] against
[15:17] non-gmo i'm trying to make the point and
[15:19] build off of something we can all agree
[15:21] on that these genetically modified foods
[15:23] many times they lack something that
[15:26] that's the reason why we have this food
[15:28] this is the benefit you get from it but
[15:29] once it's genetically modified it loses
[15:31] its force or vitality
[15:33] what is it that we know about a lot of
[15:34] these genetically modified foods they
[15:36] can't reproduce themselves
[15:37] so it lacks a force it lacks a vitality
[15:40] it lacks a seed
[15:41] and so this we could just use this in
[15:43] our minds to to understand
[15:45] what the how they had made the word of
[15:46] god and none effect
[15:48] and as i was studying the message of the
[15:50] hour and just finding how brother madam
[15:52] uses this term modernist we find that
[15:54] in the way that brother adam refers to
[15:56] modernist modernists deny
[15:58] part of the word there's some part of
[16:00] the word that modernists will deny but
[16:02] the ram says that moderners
[16:03] believe that the days of miracles are
[16:05] passed now
[16:06] they will believe some part of the word
[16:08] but deny that part of the word
[16:10] because the days and miracles are not
[16:11] passed there's no there's no way in the
[16:14] world that the
[16:15] the days of miracles are passed because
[16:16] the god of miracles is here with us
[16:18] because the word that performs the
[16:20] miracles is here with us the promise is
[16:21] still the same he gave a promise to the
[16:23] church
[16:23] he gave gifts to the church and he
[16:25] manifested himself through signs and
[16:26] wonders and miracles
[16:27] and every single one of us should have a
[16:29] faith to believe in miracles
[16:32] the greatest of miracle whatever miracle
[16:33] you think would be the most
[16:35] most outstanding in your life right now
[16:37] you ought to believe for it
[16:38] because the days of miracles are not
[16:39] passed and there may be a way that we
[16:42] could take
[16:43] types and shadows and certain examples
[16:45] in the scripture
[16:47] and say well you know we've entered into
[16:48] a garden of gethsemane where the spirit
[16:50] of the lord has left the bride and she's
[16:52] just there wrestling things out
[16:54] but there still is a great miracle in
[16:55] that garden
[16:57] there is still a tremendous victory in
[16:59] things right so it doesn't matter to me
[17:00] what types and shadows you want to use
[17:03] the days of miracles are not past but
[17:05] modernist will deny that part of the
[17:07] word
[17:09] really if you think about the the modern
[17:12] uh
[17:13] way of thinking the moral relativism and
[17:16] and post-modernist truth is how that
[17:18] there really is no real truth there
[17:21] really is no
[17:22] overriding absolute and something that
[17:24] is true to all of us we just have facts
[17:26] that we can all agree on and facts that
[17:28] are universal but truth is something
[17:30] that's subjective and tell you that's
[17:31] one of the biggest lies you can be told
[17:33] truth is not subjective truth is truth
[17:36] and truth is the ultimate and truth is
[17:38] what we long for and truth is what we
[17:39] want
[17:40] but modernists will deny truth they will
[17:43] deny a part of the word they can
[17:44] believe that the days and miracles are
[17:46] past but then preach and believe
[17:47] that something else in the word of god
[17:49] is true
[17:51] another way that brother branham refers
[17:52] to modernist is that modernists change
[17:55] part of the word and so they'll deny
[17:58] part of the word but then they'll also
[18:00] change a part of the word and when they
[18:01] change part of the word
[18:03] they deprive the eater of the vital
[18:05] force that's necessary
[18:06] in the word you take the word and change
[18:09] it
[18:10] then you're not going to get the
[18:11] essential life the essential power the
[18:13] essential nutrients
[18:14] that are in the word that the word wants
[18:16] to provide to you
[18:17] you modify it you change it then you
[18:19] lose the benefit of it
[18:21] and so if you wanted to take that and
[18:23] study it yourself brother i'm using this
[18:24] term
[18:25] modernist he points out how the
[18:27] modernists teach
[18:28] uh in the church age book he talks how
[18:29] they teach a particular doctrine
[18:31] and this doctrine is actually contrary
[18:33] to scripture and they've changed it and
[18:34] changing it
[18:35] it keeps people from coming to a birth
[18:37] keeps them from coming to life
[18:39] and so this the modernist
[18:43] whether i was using them as central
[18:44] figures and these
[18:46] modern theological terms essential
[18:48] figures in
[18:49] the drought essential figures in the
[18:52] fact that there's a famine for hearing
[18:54] of the word of god
[18:55] and we've been pointing out this
[18:56] statement brother ram says and to see
[18:58] right now in this evil day that we live
[19:00] in
[19:00] when unbelievers and scientists and so
[19:03] forth are trying to cut away the very
[19:05] value of the word yet god lives in his
[19:08] word
[19:10] so there's an effort by scientists
[19:11] unbelievers and so forth to cut away the
[19:14] very
[19:14] value of the word i like how he says it
[19:17] because it may not be a complete
[19:19] and total repudiation of the word it may
[19:21] be yes
[19:22] but he ever ran into the the thing of it
[19:26] is
[19:27] ministry where you say well brother
[19:30] branham said this it's like well the
[19:31] thing of it is
[19:32] and they want to take away the very
[19:34] value of what brother branham said they
[19:36] want to take away the very value
[19:38] of what the proposition of that word is
[19:40] so it's not a complete repudiation
[19:42] to say well the thing of it is brother
[19:43] branham was not a prophet or the thing
[19:45] of it is the bible's full of heirs
[19:46] but it's they cut away the value of it
[19:49] just take away enough to where the real
[19:51] emphasis the real point the real benefit
[19:53] that we're supposed to derive from it
[19:55] is not in it and so he says yet god
[19:58] lives in his word
[20:00] so be very mindful of this as believers
[20:02] that there's a force
[20:03] there's attitudes there's there's
[20:06] movements
[20:08] and i'm just using phrases that kind of
[20:10] i'm not thinking of any particular
[20:11] movements right now but just
[20:12] there's going to be agendas and ideas
[20:14] and theologies and teachings and
[20:16] methods of satan and and habits of the
[20:19] world that are going to try to water
[20:21] down the value of the word
[20:23] and it doesn't have to be real bold and
[20:25] come unto you say the word is a lie and
[20:26] the word isn't true but just things to
[20:28] distract us from it
[20:30] water down the the power of it and and
[20:33] make it to where it's of no effect
[20:35] so he says they cut away the very value
[20:37] of the word he says yet god lives in his
[20:38] word
[20:39] so in the word there is divine life
[20:43] there's divine life in the word and with
[20:45] divine life in the word there's divine
[20:47] power
[20:48] there's divine strength there's divine
[20:49] attributes there's divine health
[20:51] and so if divine life is in the word and
[20:53] you're taking the word you're receiving
[20:55] divinity
[20:57] there's divine strength that's contained
[20:59] in
[21:00] in the word of god so when they cut away
[21:02] the value of it in some way it takes the
[21:04] divinity out of it
[21:05] it takes the supernatural aspect you may
[21:07] still have a form of it oh it sounds
[21:09] good
[21:10] and it sounds like it it sounds like the
[21:12] message or it sounds like the truth it
[21:13] sounds exciting
[21:15] and there's uh there's been meetings i
[21:17] know where sometimes you leave like man
[21:19] that was awesome that was exciting and
[21:21] and what did he mean by that but it sure
[21:24] was exciting
[21:26] and i remember one time my brother
[21:27] shared with me how after a meeting the
[21:29] person was asked the sister actually
[21:31] made the comment well i don't know if
[21:32] there's five gods now or six but that
[21:34] was deep
[21:37] wrong kind of deep wrong kind of deep
[21:40] end
[21:42] and so there is a there's a way that it
[21:44] can have a sound or can have a semblance
[21:47] but you want the substance in it because
[21:49] that's what's going to give us life and
[21:50] give us power
[21:52] oh my you all are just uh you came
[21:55] hungry tonight
[21:56] i love this this is awesome all right
[21:59] now i'm going to
[22:00] just i want to touch on some scriptures
[22:02] very quickly and i realized as i
[22:04] pondered this this evening
[22:05] that we're just going to catch some
[22:08] foundational principles
[22:09] and scriptures that are worthy of a much
[22:12] greater attention
[22:13] but i want to kind of put all the pieces
[22:14] of the puzzle as it were
[22:16] on the table maybe not all of them but
[22:17] just some of the important ones maybe we
[22:18] can find some corner pieces
[22:20] and build our boundaries for uh a more
[22:22] expounding later in second timothy
[22:24] chapter four
[22:26] verses two to four
[22:30] are you having a good week has it been a
[22:32] good week so far
[22:34] is it getting better tonight it just
[22:36] gets better
[22:37] the world calls it hump day and and we
[22:40] in this we're just kind of getting our a
[22:42] little bit of a shot
[22:44] some energy to make it to make it
[22:46] through the rest of the week
[22:48] so i trust you're doing well if not let
[22:51] us know we'd pray for you do anything we
[22:52] could to help you
[22:53] second timothy chapter four verses two
[22:55] to four now as paul is he instructs
[22:57] timothy there's things that we can
[22:58] personally gain from this
[23:00] and yet the things i want to point are
[23:02] things that are very relevant in the
[23:03] context things we can gain individually
[23:05] though not being in the role of a
[23:06] timothy necessarily
[23:08] but things are very pertinent in that
[23:10] time as paul was dealing with them
[23:12] but very very relevant to the time we're
[23:13] living in now where brother bam says
[23:15] there's unbelievers and scientists
[23:16] cutting away the very value of the word
[23:18] there's false teachers in modernist that
[23:20] have turned from god's word
[23:22] and turned to modern modern theological
[23:24] terms
[23:25] and so this is a these are very this is
[23:26] very relevant scripture
[23:28] he says to timothy preach the word be
[23:30] instant in season
[23:32] out of season reprove rebuke exhort with
[23:34] all longsuffering and doctrine
[23:36] this is instructive to him as a man of
[23:38] god as a preacher for the time will come
[23:41] eventually it'll happen for the time
[23:42] will come when they the people will not
[23:45] endure sound doctrine think of how
[23:48] extraordinary this warning is to timothy
[23:51] to say there's going to be a time
[23:52] when the people won't want it they will
[23:54] not want sound doctrine
[23:56] and then he turns this this condition
[23:59] and he just
[24:00] opens it up for us how can someone get
[24:02] to the place where they don't want
[24:04] sound doctrine i think you could ask
[24:07] anybody do you want sound doctrine they
[24:08] say yes i want
[24:09] sound doctrine but how does this
[24:11] condition overtake somebody
[24:13] says but after their own lust so now
[24:16] there's a hunger there's a desire
[24:18] there's something that is insatiable
[24:20] after their own lust shall they
[24:21] heap to themselves teachers modernist
[24:25] false teachers they'll heap to
[24:26] themselves it's kind of an odd
[24:29] uh image you know being heaped upon
[24:32] keeping teachers on themselves but this
[24:34] is something they want they want
[24:35] teachers
[24:36] they want to have this multitude they
[24:37] want to have these things being told to
[24:39] them
[24:39] and they have this condition of itching
[24:42] ears
[24:44] we might know it as allergies or the
[24:47] mesquites are in bloom and the allergies
[24:49] everyone's
[24:49] itching and scratching and it depends on
[24:52] just which one gets you but we're in
[24:53] that high tide
[24:54] of allergy season but this is something
[24:56] totally different they have itching ears
[24:59] and they shall turn away their ears from
[25:02] the truth
[25:03] and shall be turned unto fables
[25:06] now again we're just wanting to we're
[25:07] wanting just to ponder this statement
[25:09] for a few moments here
[25:10] and let me summarize it this way paul is
[25:13] describing the wrong appetite
[25:15] very language that he's using is saying
[25:17] that they can't stomach
[25:19] good teaching they don't have a they
[25:21] don't have a stomach that can handle
[25:23] healthy teaching and because they can't
[25:25] stomach it they don't want it
[25:27] like nah i don't want that no i that i
[25:29] don't that doesn't
[25:30] strike my fancy so he's saying that they
[25:32] will not endure sound doctrine which is
[25:35] healthy providing good health good
[25:37] teaching
[25:38] but they'll actually crave things to
[25:40] scratch a particular
[25:42] itch so think of it this way you have
[25:45] sound doctrine but they say nah that
[25:47] doesn't that upsets my stomach
[25:48] i don't want sound doctrine but yet it's
[25:51] not that they're not hungry they
[25:52] actually crave
[25:53] something else as a substitute than the
[25:56] word that would give them health
[25:57] they want something else that merely
[25:59] satisfies an itch
[26:00] so you have sound doctrine and itchy
[26:02] ears
[26:04] or ears that want to be itched one will
[26:06] give you strength
[26:08] one makes you healthy and alive and one
[26:10] that gives you power one gives you
[26:12] discernment one causes you to overcome
[26:14] the other one kind of just scratches an
[26:15] itch it's very very different but yet
[26:18] you could say the one who has their back
[26:19] scratched or the ear scratched
[26:21] derives a satisfaction from it to some
[26:24] degree like oh wasn't that good
[26:26] didn't that feel good to get that
[26:28] scratched it's really
[26:30] really pointing out something very very
[26:31] heavy here
[26:33] and so it says that they will not endure
[26:35] sound doctrine this is teaching this is
[26:37] doctor this is pure word because sound
[26:39] doctrine
[26:40] is not mixed with air sound doctrine is
[26:43] not mixed with humanism
[26:45] sound doctrine does not contain harmful
[26:46] ingredients that would defile health and
[26:48] weaken health
[26:49] come up spiritually now and so he says
[26:52] there'll come a time when they won't
[26:53] endure it they won't even want it and so
[26:55] think about the dynamics that are taking
[26:56] place here
[26:58] they do not want sound doctrine
[27:01] they'd rather have something that itches
[27:03] their ears
[27:05] so they become numb to doctrine that
[27:08] isn't sound
[27:10] and not only do they become numb to it
[27:12] they begin
[27:13] and that might seem to be a
[27:14] contradiction in terms they not only
[27:17] become numb or
[27:18] are unaware of the impact or the fact
[27:20] that it's not sound but then they begin
[27:21] to get a taste for it
[27:25] because now they don't they can't endure
[27:27] sound doctrine it has to be unsound
[27:30] otherwise they won't want it when it's
[27:33] pure
[27:34] it's too heavy let me get all you coffee
[27:36] drinkers on my side tonight
[27:38] how many of you take coffee just the way
[27:40] that god made it
[27:44] excreted through monkeys in thailand
[27:47] right
[27:48] how many take it just exactly you want
[27:50] it black right
[27:52] it's exactly how you want it you want
[27:53] you don't want cream you don't want
[27:54] sugar
[27:55] and yet some people will just they'll
[27:57] add cream and sugar and they get to
[27:58] where let me taste your coffee
[28:00] there ain't no coffee in here doesn't
[28:03] taste like coffee this isn't coffee what
[28:05] is this this is
[28:06] this is milk and sugar and it's just
[28:08] been darkened a little bit with some
[28:10] other some kind of
[28:11] watery brew and we said this this isn't
[28:14] coffee but what happens is
[28:15] you begin to add this and add that and
[28:17] it takes you away to where now it's not
[28:19] even coffee anymore
[28:20] and i imagine it's probably true
[28:22] starbucks probably sells more non-coffee
[28:24] items
[28:24] than coffee anymore why because it's not
[28:27] the coffee that people want
[28:28] they just want the activity and the
[28:30] action of it come on somebody don't get
[28:32] me started tonight
[28:38] get me going on starbucks
[28:43] but it's no longer the if
[28:46] just using that example the coffee i'm
[28:48] getting excited here
[28:50] you're not drinking coffee anymore
[28:51] you're drinking other things and you
[28:52] want the taste of the cream and sugar
[28:54] you want the taste of the additives
[28:56] that's really what you want you didn't
[28:57] want you don't really want the coffee
[28:59] anymore
[29:00] you just want the hot cup with
[29:01] everything else that's in it
[29:03] and paul is describing this process
[29:05] where a person becomes numb
[29:07] to the fact that there's no more coffee
[29:09] anymore it doesn't have the preeminence
[29:10] it's not the word they become numb
[29:12] to the fact that this is not sound
[29:13] teaching and then they get a taste for
[29:15] things that aren't sound
[29:17] and then here's the danger then they
[29:18] begin to crave it
[29:20] this becomes a craving to them and he
[29:22] describes it as
[29:23] itching ears
[29:27] it's a desire to hear something that
[29:29] tickles a particular fancy
[29:31] the desire to hear something that
[29:33] satisfies a particular craving or taste
[29:35] in other words you can actually take the
[29:37] preaching of the word
[29:38] and want it to come a particular way
[29:40] that merely satisfies the carnal
[29:42] appetite
[29:44] we could even do it with preaching well
[29:46] as long as it preaches
[29:47] this doctrine and puts it in this
[29:50] context as long as we're hearing about
[29:52] this and hearing about that
[29:53] that's when that really gets me going
[29:55] that that enthuses me as long as we hear
[29:57] this particular doctrine lifted up
[29:58] and we can have our little pet doctrines
[30:00] that as long as that's being taught it
[30:03] satisfies us
[30:04] but that can just merely be a human
[30:06] carnal
[30:07] taste it may relate to church things it
[30:10] may relate to
[30:11] spiritual things and things in the
[30:12] message but yet it's our own carnal
[30:14] taste
[30:15] where as long as you're satisfying me
[30:16] with that interpretation i'm fine
[30:20] so it's a itching ears there's a desire
[30:22] to hear something
[30:24] that is merely satisfying some natural
[30:27] carnal craving
[30:28] in the same way that multitudes came to
[30:31] jesus
[30:32] not because they wanted the word but
[30:33] they wanted the miracles
[30:36] and it wasn't the miracle being in
[30:38] manifestation of the word of god but as
[30:39] they ate and were full
[30:41] so as we've entered into that or if
[30:43] we've mentioned that before and use john
[30:44] chapter 6 to great detail
[30:46] in these few other sermons on this
[30:47] subject i want you to think about that
[30:49] again
[30:50] and so by not feeding on the truth
[30:53] they turned from truth because he says
[30:56] they get itching ears and they turn away
[30:57] their ears from the truth and shall be
[30:59] turned unto fables
[31:00] so by not feeding on the truth they're
[31:02] turned from the truth
[31:04] and they build an insatiable appetite
[31:06] for myth truths
[31:07] for fiction to say fables it's fictions
[31:10] things that aren't true and they
[31:13] actually have to get a taste for it
[31:16] now let me just add this as a as a a
[31:18] caveat to daily life
[31:20] we need to be very careful about the
[31:22] things that are being disseminated
[31:23] through certain media
[31:25] whether it be online whether it be in
[31:27] print whether it be through social media
[31:29] through news sites sites that aggregate
[31:31] the news whatever it might be we need to
[31:33] be very careful about the things we're
[31:34] feeding on
[31:35] because there's a lot of things that are
[31:36] spun
[31:38] a lot of things that we take and read
[31:40] and they take certain things and they
[31:41] spin it they put in a particular context
[31:43] that they're framing things with a
[31:44] particular narrative where it makes it
[31:46] sound like oh my goodness is a big
[31:48] huge issue this thing is overwhelming
[31:52] and this thing is a huge hot topic we
[31:54] got to watch this we got to watch that
[31:55] and there's a lot of let me just use it
[31:57] fake news
[31:59] my people tell me it's out there it's
[32:01] horrible fake news everywhere
[32:04] fake media we got to be very careful
[32:06] about these things that we feed on
[32:08] and build to because if you turn from
[32:10] truth you'll get an appetite for the
[32:12] false and so this is exactly what he's
[32:15] saying they get these itching ears
[32:17] now notice this progress or this process
[32:20] second thessalonians chapter 2
[32:22] verses 10 to 12.
[32:26] i think that principle the wrong
[32:27] appetite we catch that
[32:29] now this is the process that works
[32:31] within this in these individuals
[32:33] and he's talking about the antichrist
[32:35] spirit that comes and works these signs
[32:37] and wonders and where are the signs and
[32:39] wonders effective upon these people
[32:41] and with all deceivalness of
[32:42] unrighteousness in them that perish
[32:44] why because they received not the love
[32:47] of the truth
[32:48] which is such a heavy statement now paul
[32:52] later says but
[32:53] beloved i'm persuaded better things for
[32:55] you so you are not those
[32:57] who would be categorized as ones who did
[32:59] not receive a love of the truth but
[33:01] notice
[33:02] the characteristic of these who did not
[33:04] receive it they received not a love of
[33:06] the truth
[33:06] that they might be saved so loving the
[33:08] truth is your salvation
[33:10] loving the truth is your is your
[33:12] deliverance loving the truth
[33:13] is where your miracle begins loving the
[33:15] truth is where your deliverance begins
[33:17] loving the truth
[33:17] is where healing begins you've got to
[33:19] love the truth because that's where
[33:20] salvation is you got to love the truth
[33:23] and for this cause the fact that they
[33:24] had not received the love of the truth
[33:26] god shall send them strong delusion well
[33:28] that seems unfair
[33:31] right but yet god amplifies their
[33:33] deception by sending them strong
[33:35] delusion
[33:35] that they should believe a lie he's
[33:38] already told timothy wrote to timothy
[33:39] that they'll turn away from the truth
[33:41] and be turned to fables
[33:42] because they have this lust for things
[33:44] that scratch their ears and itch their
[33:45] ears
[33:46] and now they believe a lie that they all
[33:48] might be damned who believed not the
[33:50] truth
[33:50] and had pleasure in unrighteousness so
[33:53] now they enjoy
[33:54] they have pleasure in the
[33:56] unrighteousness this is something that
[33:57] satisfies them and tickles them and
[33:59] suits their fancy and that they enjoy
[34:02] and he's saying it's all
[34:03] as a result of receiving not the love of
[34:05] the truth
[34:07] and paul in second thessalonians chapter
[34:08] 2 refers it to the mystery of iniquity
[34:11] and so this is the effect of iniquity
[34:13] which is a violation or transgression of
[34:15] god's word deviation from the word
[34:17] so if the word is not kept pure this is
[34:19] what happens
[34:20] you do not learn to love the truth
[34:24] it says they receive not the love of the
[34:26] truth
[34:28] if if if we gather together
[34:31] with the frequency that we have been
[34:32] doing twice a week
[34:34] and what we heard were my opinions and
[34:37] my stories and even some stock tips and
[34:39] maybe
[34:40] uh the best way to solve a rubik's cube
[34:43] then you would not be learning to love
[34:45] the truth
[34:46] you could be learning to love behavioral
[34:48] economics you could be learning to love
[34:49] sociology you could be learning to love
[34:52] um the latest and greatest about
[34:53] conspiracy theories there's a lot of
[34:54] things we could be learning to love
[34:56] but if you're not hearing the word
[34:57] you're not learning to love it
[34:59] and so he's saying that they the result
[35:01] of a violation of the word of god the
[35:03] effect of iniquity
[35:04] is you do not learn to love the truth
[35:08] listen you have got to be hearing the
[35:10] word to learn to love it
[35:12] the more you hear it the more you'll
[35:13] love it i promise you you're built for
[35:15] it you're made
[35:16] for it it's in your dna listen to the
[35:18] word the more you hear it the more
[35:19] you'll love it
[35:21] the way that the unsound doctrine got
[35:23] within someone's ear and became the
[35:24] earworm and the reason why the unsound
[35:26] doctrine gets really deep into people's
[35:28] psyche
[35:28] and their spiritual appetite is because
[35:30] they listen to it and they listen to it
[35:32] enough
[35:32] to where they want to have it right i
[35:35] believe it's called the the illusion of
[35:37] truth
[35:38] a fallacy the illusion of truth bias to
[35:40] where the more often a lie is repeated
[35:43] the more likely you are to believe that
[35:45] it's true
[35:46] they've done this test a million
[35:48] different ways i've counted no
[35:50] they've done this test many different
[35:51] ways to determine how this illusion of
[35:53] truth works
[35:54] and you could just repeat something
[35:56] that's false to somebody on a saturday
[35:58] and ask them to rate the veracity of it
[36:01] and then the next week repeat it again
[36:03] and then through the process of time
[36:05] because they've heard it enough they'll
[36:06] change
[36:07] their opinion about whether or not it
[36:09] was true but they'll think well it must
[36:10] be true i keep hearing it over and over
[36:13] and forget that at one time they knew it
[36:15] was air it knew it was a lie
[36:17] but it's repeated enough to where it
[36:18] becomes something that you are willing
[36:20] to believe and accept
[36:21] and it's called the illusion of truth
[36:23] this is something that if you listen to
[36:25] the wrong
[36:26] things enough you'll begin to like wrong
[36:28] things
[36:29] you just get an appetite for it
[36:33] you've got to start somewhere it's got
[36:35] to there's got to be some hook that gets
[36:36] in there
[36:37] and trust there's a lot of things in the
[36:39] world that if they could just get their
[36:40] hook in you
[36:41] just get you started all it takes is one
[36:43] episode
[36:45] right all it takes is the first the
[36:47] first one in a series
[36:49] and kind of gets its hook and then you
[36:50] want you have this appetite where is
[36:51] this going where is this leading
[36:53] how is this going to work out come on
[36:55] somebody
[36:57] don't get don't get me on starbucks
[36:59] again
[37:04] it says that you have not received a
[37:06] love of the truth they've not learned to
[37:08] love the truth
[37:10] you can't just accept truth sympathize
[37:13] with truth
[37:14] acknowledge that it's right you must
[37:16] love it
[37:18] it's not just hearing it and saying i
[37:20] believe it's true
[37:21] but it's hearing it enough to love it
[37:24] fall in love with it
[37:26] in matthew chapter 24 verses 11 and 12
[37:28] and many false prophets shall arise and
[37:30] shall deceive many
[37:32] and because iniquity shall abound the
[37:34] mystery of iniquity is referred to in
[37:35] second thessalonians chapter 2
[37:37] it's iniquity that's at work in second
[37:39] timothy but now jesus saying because
[37:41] iniquity abounds the love of many shall
[37:43] wax cold
[37:45] because the word is watered down the
[37:47] word is changed because the word is
[37:48] abandoned
[37:49] as the word is abandoned as people
[37:51] become comfortable with things that
[37:52] aren't the word and things that aren't
[37:53] holding to the standard of the word and
[37:55] as the word is not lifted up as the word
[37:56] doesn't have preeminence
[37:57] we will just grow accustomed to it
[38:02] this is how we have you ever sat back
[38:05] and wondered
[38:06] how in the world do people continue in
[38:09] things and follow people into such
[38:12] terrible air
[38:14] that there's there's a doctrine that's
[38:16] uh it's kind of limited maybe to a
[38:17] particular segment
[38:19] are people that are worshiping a man
[38:21] they claim to believe the message and
[38:22] they're rewriting worship songs
[38:24] to lift up the new name of god and
[38:25] worship a man this is a man they've
[38:27] known for decades this is a man that
[38:29] they knew was just a natural man
[38:31] but how do they get to a place where
[38:32] hundreds of people are lifting up and
[38:34] worshiping a man
[38:36] and believing a man is god and god has a
[38:38] new name and this is the god that's been
[38:40] introduced by the message of era how do
[38:42] they get to that they grow
[38:44] numb to air and they stop exercising
[38:47] discernment
[38:48] and they can be led into anything and
[38:52] because the
[38:52] iniquity abounds the deviation from
[38:55] truth just one misstep
[38:57] and a lack of accountability a lack of
[38:59] standing up for truth the lack of saying
[39:00] hold on wait a minute that's not what
[39:02] brother branham taught
[39:03] i'll get you one step away and as you
[39:05] remain in that process
[39:07] you can get further and further to where
[39:08] now you are completely outside of the
[39:10] realm of truth
[39:14] the love of many shall wax cold now it
[39:16] doesn't say their passion or fervency or
[39:18] fanaticism wax cold
[39:20] but their love of what the truth wax is
[39:22] cold
[39:23] some of the most some of people who are
[39:25] the most wrong are the most zealous
[39:29] don't ever mistake uh emotion and
[39:32] enthusiasm and zeal and even an energy
[39:35] and even a sensation as vindication
[39:37] that what is being preached and what is
[39:38] being lifted up is right
[39:41] some of the most dynamic emotional uh
[39:44] sensational
[39:46] services can be in services where
[39:48] everybody's gathered around a particular
[39:49] idea
[39:50] and that idea keeps getting lifted up
[39:52] and lifted up and people can be whipped
[39:54] into a frenzy
[39:56] whipped into an absolute frenzy over
[39:58] false doctrine and and you can say well
[40:00] man that was so moving and that was so
[40:01] powerful and people were crying
[40:03] people were slayed and people were
[40:04] dancing and it seems very very powerful
[40:06] and very very strong but you've got to
[40:08] have discernment to ask yourself
[40:10] what was being lifted up
[40:13] so it's not just fervency and passion
[40:15] that wax is cold formalism or formality
[40:18] isn't necessarily the only way that it
[40:20] can be exhibited it can be in fanaticism
[40:22] and exuberance and
[40:23] a physical emotional workup but the love
[40:25] of the word
[40:26] has wax cold so here's the cycle that
[40:30] these scriptures are identifying
[40:33] even if you want to go back to isaiah 55
[40:34] and amos 8 mark 7 and
[40:36] each one of these verses we can see that
[40:38] there's a cycle that it begins to
[40:40] place before us and we could we can draw
[40:42] this from it and i'll say this is me
[40:44] taking advantage of the fact that i'm
[40:45] the one that's preaching the sermon so
[40:47] i'm putting it in this context there's
[40:49] other ways that this is clearly
[40:51] can be expressed but i'm using it in
[40:52] this type of analogy
[40:55] the cycle of the wrong diet so feeding
[40:58] on the wrong things
[40:59] leads to the wrong kind of cravings
[41:03] you're eating the wrong thing so then
[41:04] you begin to desire the wrong things and
[41:05] then it causes a weakening appetite for
[41:07] the word
[41:09] by feeding listen if you feed on
[41:10] carnality you feed on movies and
[41:12] worldly music and hobbies and fashions
[41:16] and you feed on things of the world
[41:17] that's not going to increase your
[41:19] appetite for the word
[41:22] it's just not going to do it and so the
[41:24] more you feed on worldly things the more
[41:26] you're going to get a taste
[41:27] for worldly things so it should be a
[41:29] very obvious principle
[41:31] but now look at it in this sense of
[41:33] feeding on the wrong things even a diet
[41:35] that lacks the pure word and things that
[41:37] lift up the word the wrong diet leads to
[41:39] desiring the wrong things and that's
[41:41] going to cause a weakening appetite for
[41:43] the word
[41:44] you just don't want it as much as you
[41:45] used to
[41:48] it could explain those maybe
[41:51] some have prayed and asked the lord lord
[41:53] i want to i want to get into this more i
[41:55] want to do this more
[41:56] and the reason why you don't is you
[41:58] haven't started
[42:01] you've got to start you want an appetite
[42:04] for the word
[42:04] just listen to it just start get it
[42:08] going
[42:08] don't ask god to give it to you you got
[42:10] to start
[42:12] i if if you don't have a craving for
[42:13] ritos it's because you never had it
[42:18] can i get a witness no not everybody
[42:22] likes it i'm learning
[42:23] but you have to have had it to crave it
[42:25] at least i'm learning the more i've
[42:27] mentioned it the more people crave it
[42:28] they've never had it before so that's
[42:29] the beautiful part of preaching the word
[42:31] man what is he talking about i want some
[42:33] of that that's what i want to happen
[42:34] with the word
[42:36] get into it listen to it hear it begins
[42:39] to work something
[42:40] in you and so with this cycle in mind in
[42:43] revelations chapter 2 verse 4.
[42:46] this is in the ephesian church age
[42:47] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[42:49] thee despite
[42:49] all their great things that they had
[42:51] there was something that began to work
[42:53] and the lukewarm
[42:54] the spirit of the antichrist began to
[42:55] work within the framework of the
[42:57] christian church making
[42:58] it lukewarm and powerless and he says
[43:00] this is what he had against him that
[43:01] thou hast
[43:02] left thy first love how did brother baby
[43:05] describe it they had turned away from
[43:06] following the pure word
[43:09] that was their first love because
[43:10] iniquity shall bound the love of many
[43:12] shall wax cold
[43:13] they receive not a love of truth they
[43:15] did not learn to love the truth why
[43:17] because they're not hearing the truth
[43:18] and hearing it learning to love it they
[43:20] had left off from hearing the pure word
[43:22] they turned to man's devices and man's
[43:24] principles and man's organisms
[43:25] and all these other ways of of producing
[43:28] church systems
[43:30] and that way they lost their appetite
[43:32] and taste for the pure word of god
[43:34] bill ram describes it this way says the
[43:36] fervent desire to please god
[43:38] the passion to know his word the cry for
[43:41] reaching out in the spirit all begin to
[43:43] fade
[43:44] and instead of that church being on fire
[43:47] with the fire of god
[43:48] it has cooled off and become a bit
[43:50] formal
[43:51] don't ever let this be said of your
[43:53] experience don't ever let it be said
[43:55] about your church
[43:57] the fervent desire to please god the
[43:59] passion to know his word the cry to
[44:00] reach out the spirit that all begins to
[44:02] fade it begins to wane it begins to get
[44:04] weak
[44:04] where did it begin by leaving the love
[44:07] of the word
[44:08] the first love is the word you begin to
[44:10] leave that desire leaves passion leaves
[44:12] a cry leaves
[44:13] it all begins to fade and the fire of
[44:16] god leaves
[44:17] and you cool off because the word is the
[44:19] source of your heat
[44:21] the word is the source of your fire the
[44:23] word is the source of your fervency the
[44:24] word is the source of your strength
[44:25] that's what it must be and because they
[44:27] left their first love watch how this
[44:29] cycle completes itself in revelations 3
[44:31] 16
[44:32] so then because thou art lukewarm now
[44:34] this is what it ends up in the laodicean
[44:36] church age
[44:37] for then because thou art lukewarm and
[44:39] neither cold nor hot
[44:40] i will spew thee out of my mouth
[44:43] and the cycle is complete because christ
[44:46] is kicked out of a church he's a
[44:47] fugitive in his own church
[44:48] the laodicean church age if you want to
[44:50] know brother i called it the most
[44:52] ridiculous of all the church ages
[44:54] it is completely blacked out there is no
[44:56] light in the laodicean church age
[44:58] and the very final this is the final
[45:00] characterization of the laodicean church
[45:02] age is
[45:03] christ is outside of the church he will
[45:06] not come back into the church he's
[45:07] outside of the church
[45:08] and he stands outside of the church
[45:10] calling the believer out of it
[45:12] that's the exact that's the truth that's
[45:14] the reality of the time that we're
[45:15] living in
[45:16] that's the reality of what these
[45:18] scriptures speak to the cycle has then
[45:20] run itself complete christ is put
[45:22] out of the church but notice it's still
[45:24] church
[45:27] it doesn't say christ is put out and it
[45:28] turns into a literal temple of satan
[45:42] it's still a church but it's become a
[45:45] tepid formality
[45:49] think about just a lukewarm no fervent
[45:52] desire to please god
[45:53] it doesn't say there's not a fervent
[45:55] desire but it's not a fervent desire to
[45:57] please god
[45:59] there's not a passion to know his work
[46:00] doesn't say there's not a passion that's
[46:02] not a passion noah's word
[46:05] there may be a cry for reaching out but
[46:06] it's not in the spirit all of that
[46:08] begins to fade
[46:09] and instead of that church being on fire
[46:11] with the fire of god it's cooled off
[46:12] from that it's become a bit formal and
[46:15] so what it's become is it's still church
[46:16] but it's formal
[46:17] it's lukewarm it's mixed in way too much
[46:20] because it's not cold where it's
[46:22] rejected it outright but it's become a
[46:24] mixture
[46:25] a lukewarm church brother brown makes
[46:27] this statement and greatest battle ever
[46:29] fought
[46:29] because when brother branham is
[46:30] describing these scriptures in a few
[46:31] places he talks about laodicean being
[46:33] smothered over
[46:34] and christ being smothered over and
[46:36] kicked out of the church
[46:39] and the greatest battle ever thought
[46:40] brother says god is training for this
[46:42] battle
[46:43] matthew 24 said there and also daniel 12
[46:46] said there would be a time of trouble
[46:47] such as never like on the earth before
[46:50] we read how that christ said because
[46:52] false prophets shall arise and deceive
[46:53] many
[46:54] and iniquity shall abound and the love
[46:56] of many shall wax cold
[46:58] but brother adam teaches us and the
[47:00] scripture points out that in matthew
[47:01] 24 despite all these great deceiving
[47:04] things the elect cannot be deceived
[47:13] he says the trauma time of trouble will
[47:15] come he says and we're living in that
[47:16] time
[47:17] we're living in the time of matthew 24
[47:19] 24 we're living in the time of matthew
[47:20] 24 11 and 12 we're living in the time
[47:22] of revelations 3 16 we're living in the
[47:24] time when christ has put outside the
[47:25] church
[47:26] we're living in that time when culture
[47:27] and education and things
[47:29] have smothered over the word of god and
[47:31] got into reasonings and so forth
[47:34] again as he said scientists and
[47:35] unbelievers and so forth have
[47:37] tried to cut away at the very value of
[47:38] the word now he uses it in this context
[47:40] culture education things
[47:42] have smothered over the word of god it's
[47:44] smothered over it's tried to cover it up
[47:46] it's trying to defile it get between you
[47:48] and the effectiveness of it
[47:49] and get into reasonings and so forth so
[47:52] it doesn't have to be a complete
[47:54] rejection
[47:54] of the word it's just enough of the
[47:56] changing of it to where it's covered
[47:58] over with something else
[48:00] to give you a taste for that
[48:03] it just the thought comes to my mind i
[48:06] don't know if it's because i smell
[48:07] something cooking but
[48:08] there's a way that you could take
[48:11] something
[48:12] and maybe it's the example i used
[48:13] earlier about coffee how you can begin
[48:16] with something
[48:17] and then just begin to subtly introduce
[48:19] something else in
[48:22] slowly and slowly to where eventually
[48:23] maybe it becomes equal parts
[48:26] but then you start fading out the other
[48:29] part
[48:30] and eventually you can lead somebody to
[48:32] where you've transitioned them
[48:34] from what they thought was what was
[48:37] carrot cake
[48:39] and now they're eating zucchini bread
[48:43] and what you did is you just started out
[48:44] with carrot cake
[48:46] and then you just introduce a zucchini
[48:48] and slowly but surely through the
[48:49] process of time
[48:50] you're going man this is the best carrot
[48:52] cake i've ever had in my life
[48:54] ain't no carrots in it it's all zucchini
[48:58] what happened because your appetite
[49:00] you're so focused on something you can
[49:02] be lulled
[49:03] and drawn away from it and that's why
[49:05] he's talking about the word getting
[49:06] smothered over and into reasonings and
[49:07] so forth
[49:08] and really what you've got is something
[49:09] that's smothered over it's a waffle
[49:12] house
[49:12] doctrine smothered covered scattered and
[49:16] scuttled or whatever and it's not the
[49:19] word and it's purity or the word
[49:20] you get into reasonings and so forth
[49:26] that's the time that we're living in
[49:27] we're living in that time now culture
[49:29] education
[49:30] things have smothered over the word of
[49:31] god so we have to be on our toes
[49:34] we have to be careful that we're not
[49:35] eating something that's been smothered
[49:36] over
[49:37] i don't know if it's true i heard one
[49:39] time and maybe i heard it enough where i
[49:40] began to believe that it was true
[49:42] that the reason why the french got so
[49:43] good at sauces is because the meat
[49:45] tasted so bad
[49:46] is that true i don't know that's just
[49:47] what i heard they do have some pretty
[49:49] good sauces
[49:51] but you don't want to have that what's
[49:53] the underlying meat what's being taught
[49:55] which being preached is so bad you got
[49:57] to smother it over with everything else
[49:59] well we got a nice gym we provide donuts
[50:03] you know everyone gets a free parking
[50:04] spot up front once a month you know you
[50:06] get to park in the pastor's park and i
[50:07] mean some kind of gimmick
[50:09] well dude it's because what's being
[50:10] preached isn't the drawing card
[50:13] you've got to come up with light shows
[50:14] and fog machines and great dynamics this
[50:16] and dynamic bad and you know what we
[50:17] offer
[50:18] uh we offer child care for all your kids
[50:20] so you can just they get a number when
[50:22] they go in and you can go into church
[50:23] and you can sit there and if your number
[50:25] pops up on the screen that means you got
[50:26] a problem with your kid in the back
[50:27] and people offer these things and that
[50:29] becomes the drawing card for going to
[50:31] church
[50:32] why because the meat's not good enough
[50:35] it's got to be smothered over and
[50:36] covered up with a lot of fancy sauces
[50:38] listen
[50:39] i want to go to a steak church i just
[50:42] want the meat red meat cook it rare plus
[50:45] and i just give it to me the way it is i
[50:46] don't need ketchup i don't need steak
[50:48] sauce
[50:49] if it's real good prime word i can eat
[50:52] it
[50:52] but if you're going to overcook it if
[50:54] it's not going to be primed go ahead put
[50:55] ketchup put sauces
[50:57] put tarragon everything else i might as
[50:58] well just chop it up put it in gravy
[51:01] right you get my point
[51:06] when the word is all when it's not there
[51:07] and it's not enough it's got to be
[51:09] smothered over
[51:10] so you got to be very discerned you got
[51:11] to have the kind of palate say wait a
[51:12] minute is this even meat
[51:15] listen i don't care what the world does
[51:16] we don't want to go beyond me
[51:20] we want the word i do not care if they
[51:23] can manufacture and genetically produce
[51:25] something that sounds like the word and
[51:28] looks like the word
[51:29] and smells like the word just give me
[51:32] the word that's what i want is it
[51:35] amazing that
[51:36] a lot of the oh boy here i go
[51:39] just scatter shooting isn't it amazing
[51:42] how a lot of the vegan or vegetarian
[51:43] products are trying to simulate meat
[51:48] i mean just keep a carrot a carrot man
[51:50] hey eggplant's great the way it is you
[51:52] don't have to trick me and make me think
[51:53] it's
[51:53] filet mignon all right mushrooms a
[51:56] mushroom i eat it because it's mushroom
[51:58] but it's amazing how it's trying to go
[52:00] this place we take organic plant-based
[52:02] foods
[52:03] and trick you into thinking that it is
[52:06] meat
[52:07] what's the point it's not any healthier
[52:11] i'm not opening the floor for discussion
[52:14] but
[52:15] i mean if somebody at least believes
[52:16] this way of viewing it the the
[52:18] the beyond meat burgers they're they are
[52:21] not any more nutritious and less fat
[52:23] less calories than the real deal
[52:28] where's my drummers
[52:32] and we have to be on our toes and very
[52:34] discerning that what we're getting is
[52:35] not something that's a substitute
[52:39] where god wants to give us the fresh
[52:41] kill of the hour and we're being served
[52:42] plant-based opinions that's been
[52:46] baked to sound like and smell like
[52:49] the word but it's not
[52:55] revelations chapter 3 verse 20. i'm glad
[52:57] i mentioned exodus 12 in the beginning
[52:59] because i'm
[53:00] going to be nowhere close to it so
[53:02] listen to the
[53:03] the the salt the solve to this problem
[53:08] this is the solution we've got a problem
[53:09] what do we do how do we fix it
[53:11] behold i stand at the door
[53:15] here are people that are lukewarm
[53:18] they've
[53:18] left their first love they received not
[53:20] a love of the truth there's a famine for
[53:21] hearing the word of god it's completely
[53:23] into chaos
[53:24] christ is put outside the church behold
[53:26] i stand at the door and
[53:28] knock if any man hear my voice and open
[53:31] the door
[53:32] i will come in to him and will sup with
[53:35] him
[53:35] and he with me god's
[53:39] answer to this condition as a spiritual
[53:41] feast
[53:43] however you want to describe laodicea
[53:45] however you want to describe the
[53:46] condition of the people they left their
[53:47] first love they have pleasure and
[53:48] unrighteousness the love of many is wax
[53:50] cold
[53:50] they um the fervent desire is gone the
[53:52] passion of the word is gone they become
[53:54] lukewarm all these things of laodicea
[53:56] wretched and poor blind miserable naked
[53:58] and don't know it all this condition
[54:00] that exists of the blindness and the
[54:02] nakedness and the poor appetite this
[54:05] poor spiritual condition that god's
[54:08] answer is
[54:09] a spiritual feast behold i stand at the
[54:12] door and knock
[54:12] and the answer isn't isn't that a
[54:14] beautiful knock the answer isn't just
[54:15] merely hearing the voice and
[54:17] acknowledging the voice
[54:17] the answer is through the voice you're
[54:20] brought into union and fellowship
[54:22] i will come into him you've got to hear
[54:24] the word hear the voice and the voice
[54:27] unlock the secret of opening the door
[54:29] and then once you open the door he can
[54:31] come
[54:31] into you and will suck with you and you
[54:34] will sup with him
[54:35] you know what sup means it means supper
[54:38] i will come and feast with him i will
[54:40] come and dine with him
[54:41] it's a use this word sup is especially
[54:44] used of a meal that's held at evening
[54:46] and it's not just a light snack it's
[54:48] something that has courses and multiple
[54:50] courses to it
[54:51] says i will come in and i'm not just
[54:52] going to throw him a power bar i'm not
[54:54] just going to
[54:54] give him a plant-based snack i'm going
[54:56] to come in and i'm going to sup
[54:58] with him it's going to be a seven-course
[55:00] meal for this bride to feel
[55:02] and that's the answer to every spiritual
[55:05] malady
[55:05] and the spiritual condition of laodicea
[55:08] is that you are eating on the right
[55:09] things
[55:10] i can say right now with absolute
[55:12] assurance and with thus saith the lord
[55:14] whatever your problem is right now the
[55:17] solution is taking the word for it
[55:20] doesn't matter if it's marital doesn't
[55:22] matter if it's financial does it matter
[55:23] if it's physical
[55:24] emotional or whatever it is you can feed
[55:26] on the vitamins of the word of god
[55:29] how is it brother tom ray says it take a
[55:30] gospel the gospel the gospel pill
[55:33] that's what we need to take and pour
[55:35] into our faith these vitamins
[55:37] it'll solve everything
[55:43] i will come in to mess up with them
[55:45] we'll feast
[55:48] we'll dine if any man hear my voice
[55:52] it's the voice of revelations 18 4 that
[55:53] says come out of her my people
[55:55] the voice of revelations chapter 10 in
[55:58] the days of the voice of the seventh
[55:59] angel
[56:00] verse 8 and the voice which i heard from
[56:02] heaven spake unto me again and said go
[56:04] and take the little book which is open
[56:05] in the hand of angel
[56:07] which stand upon the scene upon the
[56:08] earth behold i stand at the door knock
[56:11] if any man hear my voice well you can
[56:12] hear the voice i heard the voice of the
[56:14] lord and he said go
[56:15] tell go and take the book out of the
[56:17] hand of this mighty angel
[56:18] so i went unto the angel and i said unto
[56:21] him
[56:22] give me the little book we're walking
[56:25] through the steps of revelations chapter
[56:26] 3 into revelations chapter 4.
[56:28] hear this voice comes behold i stent the
[56:30] door knock here's an opportunity for the
[56:32] bride to be raptured up quickly out of a
[56:34] lail to see in condition
[56:35] what happens when she gets caught up she
[56:37] has an opportunity as we see in
[56:39] revelations chapter 3 verse 20
[56:40] to feast and this is exactly what
[56:42] happens in revelations 10 8-9
[56:44] you hear a voice the voice says go take
[56:46] the book the voice tells you to go take
[56:48] the books what do you do
[56:49] you go to the mighty angel say give me
[56:50] the little book and watch the further
[56:52] revelation unfold
[56:54] and the mighty angel says take it and
[56:56] eat it up
[56:57] you didn't get that in just the voice or
[56:59] the knocking you got that when you had
[57:01] the face-to-face meeting with the mighty
[57:03] angel
[57:04] if then that an opportunity is given to
[57:06] you to feed upon the unfailing body word
[57:09] of the son of man
[57:10] it's then that he says now you can take
[57:12] the book and eat it because i will sup
[57:14] with you and you with me
[57:17] the message of the hour creates
[57:21] preaches and ministers an entrance into
[57:23] this evening time
[57:24] feast the voice of god making this
[57:28] introduction
[57:29] message creates a hunger a hunger for
[57:32] the book a demand for the book
[57:35] and then when you go to take the book
[57:36] the instruction is take it and here's
[57:38] the further revelation
[57:39] and eat it up isn't it beautiful
[57:43] it's not even in revelations chapter 10
[57:44] verse 7 or 8
[57:46] to take it and need it but it's in the
[57:48] meeting
[57:50] with the mighty angel that what the
[57:52] point was
[57:53] all along to go to him and take the book
[57:55] the point all along was so that you
[57:57] could eat it
[57:58] not talk about it eat it
[58:03] as we read in spiritual food and due
[58:05] season
[58:06] he turned from god's word and his
[58:08] prophet to a modern theological terms of
[58:10] the word
[58:10] you notice here it's just at that time
[58:14] that god always raises up something this
[58:17] is what he raised up
[58:18] a supper a feast
[58:22] let me say the this as i close the food
[58:24] at this table is about life
[58:29] it's not a banquet for carnal pleasure
[58:32] it's about life or death
[58:38] when i say eating to live and i'm just
[58:40] going to skip and bring it to a close
[58:44] when i say eating to live i like to
[58:47] expound upon it more we'll do it
[58:48] next wednesday lord willing he's talking
[58:51] about the
[58:51] at mindset and the attitude of the eater
[58:55] and ultimately what they want to get
[58:58] what they're trying to get out of what
[58:59] they're doing
[59:03] and i'm wanting us to consider what it
[59:04] is we're feeding on
[59:07] what's our daily approach to feeding our
[59:10] souls
[59:11] we have been taught to pray give us this
[59:14] day
[59:15] our daily bread
[59:18] and as we'll expound upon more next time
[59:21] feeding on the wrong things
[59:22] instigates a destructive cycle
[59:27] where it not only creates bad health it
[59:30] creates bad habits and it creates bad
[59:31] hunger
[59:33] well it's a slippery slope all it starts
[59:35] is with the one
[59:37] leads to another leads to another and it
[59:39] just completely overwhelms
[59:49] just want to find a stopping point here
[1:00:08] let's stand i found i found the stopping
[1:00:12] point
[1:00:14] you can come i trust
[1:00:17] there's been something said that's
[1:00:20] provoked some thought
[1:00:27] eating to live this would be part one of
[1:00:28] eating to live
[1:00:31] we read last wednesday in proverbs
[1:00:32] chapter 13 verse 25 the righteous
[1:00:35] eateth the satisfying of his soul but
[1:00:37] the belly of the wicked shall want
[1:00:40] the living bible i believe is what
[1:00:42] translates it to the righteous eat to
[1:00:44] live
[1:00:45] but the wicked lived to eat
[1:00:50] it was socrates is actually attributed
[1:00:52] with saying the same thing something
[1:00:54] very very similar bad men live that they
[1:00:56] may eat and drink
[1:00:58] whereas good men eat and drink that they
[1:01:00] may live
[1:01:03] socrates isn't my favorite philosopher
[1:01:04] mediocrities is
[1:01:06] yeah okay
[1:01:10] but bad men live that they may eat and
[1:01:13] drink
[1:01:14] but a good man eats and drinks that he
[1:01:16] may live
[1:01:18] i mentioned it before and we've desired
[1:01:20] that this would become part of the
[1:01:21] fabric of the foundation of this church
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:24] it's not all about coming to church
[1:01:28] it's what is coming to church about what
[1:01:31] is this even for why does god even
[1:01:33] provide this dynamic
[1:01:35] if he really thought through it and
[1:01:36] pondered it
[1:01:39] what else i mean we work from home
[1:01:42] a lot of us do now so we're not
[1:01:43] commuting to work i mean we're at home
[1:01:45] we work all day
[1:01:46] but then the one thing we've done over
[1:01:47] the past years is we've driven miles and
[1:01:50] hours and expended resources and we've
[1:01:52] done a lot to what to be in fellowship
[1:01:54] to be in church
[1:01:55] what are we doing it for why
[1:01:58] why do we get together twice a week why
[1:02:00] are we wanting to do it
[1:02:02] more often why are we trying to find a
[1:02:03] building why do you pay your tithes and
[1:02:05] give offerings why do you support
[1:02:07] mission work
[1:02:07] what is it all is it just because we
[1:02:09] look to the word and we've developed
[1:02:10] these
[1:02:11] uh these uh things these habits of
[1:02:13] paying tithes and giving offerings and
[1:02:15] supporting missions and going to church
[1:02:17] and
[1:02:17] fulfilling certain duties and having
[1:02:19] church order and we have all this
[1:02:21] function and all this pomp and all this
[1:02:23] circumstance and we don't take a step
[1:02:24] back and say well wait a minute what do
[1:02:25] we do what are we even doing this for
[1:02:28] what's it all about what are we trying
[1:02:30] to accomplish
[1:02:32] we're wanting to get out of here
[1:02:35] and i don't believe that god wants us to
[1:02:36] go by way of the grave and have a
[1:02:38] have flowery words set over our a casket
[1:02:41] that contains the shell of our person
[1:02:43] but i believe god's wanting to raise up
[1:02:44] a bride into the skies
[1:02:46] to triumph over death and so in order to
[1:02:48] do that we got to be eating to live
[1:02:51] it's got to be it has to be a
[1:02:53] desperation and in exodus chapter 12
[1:02:55] when they came together god did not just
[1:02:57] say hey
[1:02:58] get a lamb eat a lamb eat bread and
[1:03:02] while you're eating i'm going to kill a
[1:03:03] bunch of people in egypt
[1:03:05] that's not what he said he said i'm
[1:03:08] going to visit egypt
[1:03:09] and i'm going to kill the firstborn of
[1:03:11] every house
[1:03:13] that does not take a lamb
[1:03:17] without blemish drain its blood
[1:03:20] put that blood upon the door posting the
[1:03:22] lentil clears all the leaven out of the
[1:03:24] house
[1:03:24] makes unleavened bread roast the lamb
[1:03:27] with fire
[1:03:29] eats cooks it with all the pertinence
[1:03:31] and everything doesn't use herbs doesn't
[1:03:33] boil it in water
[1:03:34] eats all of it and it is dressed
[1:03:38] as in you're getting ready to leave
[1:03:39] while you eat it
[1:03:41] those are the ones who will not die and
[1:03:44] what could be said to the son who looked
[1:03:46] at all this strange stuff
[1:03:48] what could be said about why dad why
[1:03:49] that lamb dad why are you bleeding it
[1:03:51] out that way
[1:03:52] dad why are you taking those weeds and
[1:03:54] put on the doorpost and lentil
[1:03:55] mom why are you roasting we don't like
[1:03:57] it roasted we've never roasted it why
[1:03:59] aren't you using herbs why don't you use
[1:04:00] that special rub you always use
[1:04:02] why don't we do this why are we doing it
[1:04:03] that way why are we putting our shoes on
[1:04:05] it's the middle night why are you making
[1:04:06] bread without leaven
[1:04:07] why do you have your staff in your hand
[1:04:08] why are you all eating why are you all
[1:04:10] eaten with haste
[1:04:11] the father could look at his son and say
[1:04:13] son i'm eating to live
[1:04:16] that's why we're doing this tonight
[1:04:18] we're eating to live
[1:04:19] unlike any other time before we might
[1:04:21] have eaten because we were hungry
[1:04:22] we ate because the lamb was ready we ate
[1:04:24] because this is the way we like it but
[1:04:26] tonight
[1:04:27] everything we're doing we're doing that
[1:04:29] you might
[1:04:30] live son
[1:04:34] i'm living because of what i'm eating
[1:04:38] i'll triumph over death what were they
[1:04:40] doing they were eating in desperation
[1:04:43] why are you doing it that way why are
[1:04:44] you doing it that way why are you doing
[1:04:45] it that way this is desperation it's set
[1:04:47] in i've asked myself
[1:04:48] what am i doing this for
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:52] if all we want is the form and all we
[1:04:55] want
[1:04:55] is just the semblance
[1:04:58] having church is very very very easy
[1:05:03] i've said this i'm saying it to family
[1:05:06] tonight
[1:05:08] you could say amen really really loud in
[1:05:10] light of recent circumstances but
[1:05:12] anybody can start a church
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:16] right and
[1:05:19] maybe i i say that a little bit
[1:05:21] tongue-in-cheek but i realized and
[1:05:23] started church the fact that one could
[1:05:24] get started won't be any vindication to
[1:05:26] me
[1:05:28] because anyone can start a church but it
[1:05:30] takes god to lead it it takes god to
[1:05:32] feed it
[1:05:33] and that's what church is about eating
[1:05:36] to live
[1:05:37] and i believe that god has made
[1:05:38] available to us a word
[1:05:41] that'll feed your souls and that's what
[1:05:44] we want to do we want to eat
[1:05:45] what there's so much more to share right

[1:05:49] a dozen other slides in there
[1:05:51] that would just keep him keep it keep it
[1:05:53] tight don't let that get out
[1:05:55] lord willing we'll share it next

[1:06:01] hungry for truth hungry for the word say
[1:06:03] lord feed
[1:06:04] my soul feed my soul let's pray our
[1:06:06] gracious heavenly father
[1:06:08] thank you lord for the wonderful
[1:06:09] presence that we have experienced
[1:06:10] tonight
[1:06:11] the liberty that we we may even take
[1:06:15] advantage of as a friend and as a
[1:06:17] brother
[1:06:18] in the comfortableness of our spirits
[1:06:22] the enthusiasm of the people to pull
[1:06:23] upon the word lord it just can let your
[1:06:25] guard down
[1:06:27] and express things now i'm so grateful
[1:06:31] father that we have this blessed dynamic
[1:06:32] where these things can be lifted up and
[1:06:34] preached
[1:06:36] lord i'm sharing these things for our
[1:06:38] personal individual
[1:06:39] benefit these are not observations lord
[1:06:43] these are teachings in your word
[1:06:48] this is not us taking a survey of the
[1:06:50] spiritual condition of laodicea
[1:06:53] this is us taking inventory of our
[1:06:55] personal lives
[1:06:59] you've called us lord to a table
[1:07:02] which is spread with
[1:07:05] meat to feed our souls
[1:07:11] we let so much keep us from this table
[1:07:17] what i had in my heart to look at the
[1:07:20] natural example of how
[1:07:22] those who are unhealthy
[1:07:26] actually don't even derive the pleasure
[1:07:28] that they're expecting
[1:07:29] in food therefore it makes them crave
[1:07:33] more
[1:07:36] but not what would make them healthy but
[1:07:37] what makes them more unhealthy
[1:07:41] and people can find themselves in a
[1:07:43] spiritual
[1:07:46] fix spiritually unhealthy spiritually
[1:07:49] sick
[1:07:50] wanting to be free
[1:07:56] but they're so bound into bad habits
[1:08:01] that even all their supplementing
[1:08:04] never satisfies
[1:08:09] but i pray that you could set your
[1:08:11] people free
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:14] from bad habits
[1:08:17] bad health bad hunger
[1:08:23] lord may we be eating to live
[1:08:26] interacting participating in this word
[1:08:28] because we're eating to live
[1:08:30] lord
[1:08:36] not a song not a form not a semblance
[1:08:38] those things are just a tepid formality
[1:08:41] lord
[1:08:42] but may it be a desire to know you a
[1:08:44] passion a fervent
[1:08:46] desire to please you bless your people
[1:08:48] tonight
[1:08:49] in the lateness of the hour may you be
[1:08:50] with us and strengthen us heal those who
[1:08:52] are hurting and sick father
[1:08:55] may they be made well may we take your
[1:08:57] word as our supplement as our
[1:08:59] main course as the nutrients and the
[1:09:00] vitamins that we need
[1:09:03] for not only our spiritual health lord
[1:09:05] but our physical health
[1:09:07] it may be made manifest in your
[1:09:08] believers i pray in the name of the lord
[1:09:10] jesus christ
[1:09:12] amen can you say amen to the word of god
[1:09:14] tonight
[1:09:15] amen
