TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we go a step further in the subject of the Kingdom and identifying things that were at the heart of God things that were if we could call it Heaven's mystery but then are going to become magnified and manifested in the earth as we've been looking at that subject I'm taking from uh character expression to a kingdom identity and so there may be multiple Parts on this I try not to get hung up on the title but I do give some thought to it and I want there to be some continuity I heard from a brother here recently who found that my titling system was very confusing so I said well what do you suggest and he came up with volume and sub volumes and sub-genres and everything else and he said maybe this isn't maybe this isn't better but I appreciated the effort and I'm always open to suggestions I can always revert to Jesus Christ part 762. but here we're looking at Kingdom identity and in ways we're looking at how we identify the kingdom of God or the identification of the Kingdom and how it is identified in the lives of God's children those who have the life of the king will manifest and declare the character of the Kingdom and as we think about how Kingdom Life is expressed I want it to be very relevant to us I think I repeat then repeating these things quite often over the past three years that what happens within these four walls has less to do with the kingdom than what happens on the outside what takes place here is feeding on the word of God and ministering to one another and things that challenge us and shape us and set us in the right path and God manifest and declares his presence amongst us in our in our Gatherings like this but where the kingdom really is effective is when we leave and we live out amongst the people we get down to our daily lives and so that's as we've said before this is a sanctuary and we ought to be going from one Sanctuary to another when we return home and my wife even shared with me this morning about just a burden as a family and how we our whole must be a sanctuary in the way that it the feeling that it must occultivate in the presence of God being welcome and so there's a a bird there's a responsibility ability that we have not just to perfect our church services but to declare and manifest the kingdom Beyond ourselves Beyond these four walls so it has to do with our manner of living and even the order of our home and our home life our marriages and and the way those things uh operate now this is hopefully just going to grab from last two services in some way carry over thought in John chapter 10 verse 37 Jesus says if I do not the works of my father oh I knew I was forgetting something but the David Cleveland and brother Joshua Shepherd put together this beautiful backdrop so I'm very grateful for all their efforts and their labor in doing this it was supposed to make me look better but I think that probably failed in that regards because there's just some things you can't fix but thank you so much for their labor and putting this together still making some changes and we trust that you're patient as things evolve he says if I do not the works of my father believe me not now as we looked at Hebrews chapter 1 and it said about Jesus Christ that he was the express image of God and that was he was the character of God he was the very nature and character of God that to us would be invisible and that maybe we would speculate as to In Christ he has declared and his character is declared he's the express image and that word is character and what I want to draw your to your bring back to your remembrance or Draw to your attention is we're told and we're taught very clearly in the message that God identifies himself by his characteristics so we recognize God and know who God is by his characteristics and almost everything brother Bram said is identified by its characteristics whether it be plant life or animal life if you're going to distinguish among certain certain trees or mushrooms or or animal life you have to look down into the characteristics my my boys were fishing quite a bit at their grandparents Pond and they came back so we found a frog and its head is completely blue and like wow that's fascinating you know and you you kind of wonder what it is and so you just kind of look it up and that particular characteristic says it's probably poisonous and and so there's certain traits and and you know is it black and yellow kill a fellow or whatever it is when you think about snakes and is reading a book about mushrooms is there certain ones that may look like you'd want to eat them but you can't eat them and you know it by its traits or its characteristics and so everything is identified by its characteristics this is where I'm getting the thought of Kingdom identity the characteristic is something if you use it as an adjective it's pertaining to or indicating character it's a characteristic of something it it speaks of its character it's that which identifies character and as we looked into the Greek of the word character the express image it's an engraved mark a symbol or an imprint upon the soul so it's a defining quality and what is on the inside of one person as the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart that's how he really is he can do things externally but if the heart if it doesn't line up with the heart that's hypocrisy but eventually what's on the inside is what's being expressed on the outside and that's that that I defining quality of an individual is their character as Jesus says if I do not the works of my father Believe Me Not So these works are things that identify character these are things that are unique enough to God or say if we see these things it brings us to the word of God which is God and brother Branham says in the sermon God identified himself by his characteristics his characteristic he said Jesus said in Saint John 10 37 if I do not the works of my father and I don't have that character of my father then don't believe me now I love that amplification of it because as we said before there might be certain things we say oh well these are the works of Christ these are the works that he does and we could on a very surface level impersonate them say oh well these are the works of God but now there's more to it than just something on the surface but he says if I don't have the character of my father then don't believe me they are one they identify his character and me his characteristics so it's it's the whole package because the father is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the characteristic of God is displayed by his promise for that age this is a very important principle that brother Brown expresses over and over again how that God would manifest himself according to a promise in particular ages and in doing that you had to recognize the promise for that age and then as the light moves on as the light moves on whatever is true in that age is true for the subsequent age but there's a there's a way that you can hold back in a former light there's a way that you could participate in the promises of God in a glare of another age so when he says God is identified by his characteristics in the promise for that age and examples that he would use to say if Moses showed up and he had a staff in his hand and a rod in his hand he said I'm coming to deliver you all out of Phoenix and he said this is what God did in the days of the Exodus from Israel he sent a prophet named Moses and a guy standing up here bat pounding the rod saying I'm Moses I'm Moses say oh well this must be him that you have to go to the promise of your age to recognize the characteristics of God and who he is in that age that he's wanting to express himself in so this is Brother Branham showing us that God is identified by his characteristics and the kingdom the kingdom is God expressed it is the very it's the character of God made manifest in the lives of his people to look further into identification let's turn our Bibles to First Corinthians chapter 14. verses 6 to 11. and then we'll jump to verse 26 and we'll read the verse 40. I'm looking at this and the Lord just really drew me to this because of how Paul is dealing with identification and how when something expresses itself how we relate to it and how that we can discern what it is based upon how its characteristics and then where he transitions to later on in this chapter is quite remarkable it says now Brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy sign or by Doctrine so he's establishing an order of emphasis he's establishing that in the end the goal is understanding in the end in the end is knowledge and wisdom and to know and brother Branham uses the phrase the order of the anointing and he's talking about how the Holy Spirit can fall and it can manifest certain things but there's a certain order to the anointing and hear the prophet to that age is establishing this order of emphasis it says in even things without Life Giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or heart ow I don't know Paul's musical background and I don't know if some would reject him weighing in on music if he didn't have a degree in musicology but he is saying that without order and without Harmony or Melody you can't discern a tune that just because someone is piping and someone is harping and someone is drumming and someone is banging on the uh big black box you bang them white keys and there's all these sounds that are taking place unless there's some sort of harmony with the parts unless each one knows their role and there's some sort of arrangement without order without uh one compliment in the other he says you can't discern what the tune is it reminds me of a story one time where brother Isaiah Brooks was out with some young men and after a youth meeting right there a recording session and uh they were I think brother Kenny was there with them brother Ben Erickson and different ones and they were at a fast food restaurant and and they uh and they said their brother something was they're they're waiting to order someone brother said brother Isaiah what do you think about this music and he goes I can't hear the music over this machine like no that is the music and so to him he thought it was a machine and so if you don't if it's not if there's something you can't take away from it you can't discern the melody you can't discern the tune but then also it's disconcordant you can't enjoy it there's times when maybe you're listening to something and you don't hear all the sound you just hear maybe one part and it sounds just concordant it's like that doesn't sound right that's because only one part is being emphasized and then when you bring all the volumes up correctly and you mix the Cradle oh no that's beautiful it all works together otherwise there's Discord and this is what Paul is saying that if you don't if it gives if there be a distinction without the distinction it becomes just gibberish is that the very words that's being said without distinction and sounds it's just jabbering it's just chattering and he's saying the same thing about tongues unless unless there be some clarity brought to it unless there's some interpretation that follows it's just unintelligible talk it doesn't edify anyone other than the one that is speaking anybody and he's talking about characteristics and identifying for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound that means you're not sure what is it what does this mean what is this uh is this retreat is this Advanced is this Dan Dan Butterfield Butterfield Butterfield what which one is it and he says for if the trumpet give it uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle so likewise ye accept ye utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification that means every sound every voice has a meaning every voice has an idea or concept that's attached to it and there's something behind it there's some reasoning there's some rationale there's some uh there's something that's trying to be accomplished and if that's the case our what we become and how we act isn't based together on all together upon what we see and what we hear but our discernment of The Voice or the emphasis behind what we're seeing and what we're hearing so everything is with signification so there's some concept attached to it therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice if I can't discern it by its characteristics if I can't figure out what it's trying to say I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and I find this to be very extraordinary the way he says this in the example of speaking with tongues if someone is just speaking with tongues and Paul says if I don't I don't know what he's saying he thinks I'm a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me and that's why now you figure out why they're both pointing at each other saying the other one's wrong all right because one speaking with tongues you can't understand them and so to to him you're a barbarian and then and then you're looking at him saying well you're a barbarian you mean you don't understand what I'm saying you're a barbarian I don't understand what you're saying you're a barbarian and that's kind of real heavy language to be used he's saying there's so many voices all with meaning and intent that are trying to attract our attention and if if we don't understand the voice it causes confusion if the meaning cannot be identified you don't know the character of it he says it's barbaric which means rude or approachful that one speaking in tongues thinks the one who can't understand them to be a barbarian and Paul say but you're a barbarian to me you're rude you're reproachful all because the voice the meaning the intent can't be discerned now as Paul is identifying chaos and confusion based upon the manifestation of of a gift he says in verse 26 how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you have to Psalm hath a Doctrine half the tongue Hatha Revelation have an interpretation he says let all things be done unto edifying it has to build it has to promote has to encourage it has to strengthen If any man speak in an unknown tongue I recognize what's happening as a prophet is looking at a church we recognize that this church had some issues and clearly uh they when they would come together they have a Psalm a doctor and a tongue of Revelation interpretation and so we see these things must have been operating in their midst but recognize just how much sin he's having to deal with and attitudes he's having something to deal with at the same time but he says let all things be done unto edifying and now he's putting things in order if any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or at the most by three in that by course and let one interpret it I I'm not wanting to get into this as an uh as commentary on the gifts of the placing of the gifts I believe brother Brown does a tremendous job of that but I want you to recognize the principle of a prophet to an age setting things in order but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church let him speak to himself and to God let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge if anything be revealed to another that sinneth by it let the first hold his peace for you may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted this is this is a very uh specific words he says in the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets brother Brandon he refers to this he says the word of God is first never secondarily that that when the preaching the word is going forth the gifts are subject to that and if they operate in an eruption to that he's saying that's out of order because the word is first he said that the the most Supreme and most powerful anointing that Jesus Christ had the Supreme anointing the most powerful anointing that Jesus Christ had manifested itself when he opened the scroll and began to teach in wonderful words proceeded from his mouth so that is in the brother brahm's own words that's re-identifying the anointing the Supreme anointing the supreme power is when the word is going forth and so the word of God is first never secondarily and the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet so there's got to be order and and when he when he's dealing with this when the messenger deals with this he says and he gives the example where when one would say something in the name of the Lord and if it doesn't happen he said that's a lying spirit in ought to have that Spirit prayed off of him and what do we do then we recognize the word is first and if anyone in expressing a gift before the people prophesies interprets a dream or says something in the name of the Lord that is wrong that is air and he said that's an evil spirit and therefore we give honor to the word of God to be saying well that's what the word says and that's what the prophets should recognize and accept and the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets for if for God is not the author of confusion that's instability disorder is he saying that when you come one has a song one has a doctor who has a tongue one has a revelation one has an interpretation he says let things be done to the edifying if this is how it's going to be and all this pulling and pushing and shoving and everything that he said that's that's not going to edify that's not going to build up for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints it's not the author of instability or disorder but he's the author of Peace which is harmony or Accord this is ties right back into what Paul was saying that if if one speak in tongues and one doesn't understand there is disconcordant if all are just speaking in tongues and there's no interpretations that's disconcordant he's saying but God is not the author of confusion but of Peace which is harmony or cord so he's bringing it right back into his analogy of harmonizing and when it comes to music and he says one is piping and one is harping the pipe is different than the heart they both give different sounds but there's a way that they can work together to where they're lifting up and expressing the same thing and what I'm wanting to draw from this is Paul looking at things that can be things that are of God and hopefully we'll get into this more here in a moment so we can see this things that are of God and how that God wants to use them to build up and to edify but they have to have the character of God with it and here Paul in this age this is the prophet putting the age in order and I find it remarkable too because you don't this is kind of a glimpse into church order because Paul was specifically dealing with them when they come together and he's dealing with the gathering together and this is where he gets in with the Corinthian Church about communion and he's placing things in order this is a prophet placing Church order this is the prophet play placing the Believers in order within their churches and brother Branham as we mentioned it to you before he said the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order yeah so if anyone in First Corinthians 14 in the Corinthian Church objected to this and was stubborn and stiff-necked and said no sorry not going to do it we like the way we're doing it that would be proof or give you enough reason to doubt whether or not this person was what they said they were remember how brother Brown said faith and works her husband and wife if a man has faith and claims to uh uh to have to have it apart from work she says you have reason to doubt that claim just like a man who says he's married and can't produce a wife understand what the works of the indwelling spirit are it's not just works that we might think are good because you could try to do God of service without it being his will but it's works that conform with the character of God therefore the proof of the indwelling spirit are works that acknowledge and follow God's order for that age the word of God is first never secondarily so it's to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age this is a prophet placing things in order I hope this doesn't seem to be too much of a um a jerk of the steering wheel but let's catch where he goes next as you look at verse 34. as he's placing things in order in the church and I don't think it's a coincidence that he's he's addressing these things and then the very next thing he has to deal with is he says let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church these are very controversial words of poem with each day that passes they get more and more controversial now whether or not we want to wrestle with the interpretation of it and try to figure out a way that we can water it down or narrow it down whatever it may be we can all at least acknowledge he's saying let the women keep silence in the churches this is just exactly how it's been translated for us it's not prevented for them to speak they're commanded to be under obedience I say the law and he says if they'll learn anything let them ask their husbands at home to me this is one of the single greatest evidences that your pastor is not your husband spiritually speaking if you thought I was your spiritual husband I'm divorcing you right now except you sister Elizabeth I am nobody's spiritual husband Christ is your spiritual husband and sisters who are married your husband is your pastor spiritually speaking at home I'm your pastor literally speaking in the local church and this is Paul preserving the order of the marriages the order of the home where none can assert God's original order he says let the women learn at home by asking their husbands for it's a shame for women to speak of the church he goes what I just like that what he says and then this is really pointed came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only do you think your church and the way you do it's the only right way are you the first church of the Bride are you the first church of of the of the Christianity and that's exactly what Paul is saying what you think you're the only church you think the way you do things is the way things ought to be done he says if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord he's challenging any spirit that would raise up and try to use some sort of excuse or justification to disregard what the prophet had to say and I say this is the word of God to us in this age we ought to never think more of ourselves than we ought to we ought to be willing as individuals as ministers as a church make ourselves subject to the word of God for this age and if we claim to be a prophet or spiritual we must acknowledge that the things that this messenger taught us are the Commandments of the Lord and they are right he says but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues what beautiful balance let all things be done decently and in order decently in its proper form Paul doesn't Paul doesn't say one thing to turn the gifts into something evil tongues into anything evil and I think that's the that's what the devil kind of does sometimes is you draw some of us offsides and he wave something in our face and he gets us to say something against against something when we shouldn't have never spoke to begin with Don't Let The Devil tempt you whether the devil can tempts some to clown for him and do all sorts of fanaticism but you can fall for the same trap by speaking against things that you don't need to even speak against it it's indecently is in the proper form if when to do something decently means it's becoming reverence it's well formed it actually comes from the the Latin Forma speaking of beauty or shape it's shapeless well-formed it's not out of form it's not disproportionate it's not exaggerated it's something that the symmetry of it and the balance of it presents Something Beautiful let everything be done decently in the proper form with becoming reverence and in order that means a fixed Arrangement the do or proper course the right order or orderly condition and as I was reading the scriptures yesterday I just maybe late in the afternoon and and my mind is always drawn to this concept that when God in the beginning when he created and and brother Branham saying that God spoke and as things were formed he let something go so far he says stop right there he said stop right there and it wasn't random that God knew exactly what he was doing to where now there are comments that we can time and there are certain manifestations in the heavens that we could predict is going to happen on the dot even whether it be blue moons or whether it be full moons these things are timely because God said it that way in the beginning and brother man said I thought of the order of the Heavenly Host not one of them is out of place everyone keeps its time perfectly and he calls it God's Great Army the heavens the Stars the planets are all declaring something about God in Psalms 19 verses 1 to 3. I'm looking at this to recognize Paul said let all things be done decently in order this identifies something about God the heavens declare the glory of God and that that phrase the glory of God is so important because this glory is a character the heavens declare the character of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork and a man's character is known by his words so the character of God is declared in his creation it's declared in the heavens it's declared in those endless galaxies as it seems and the firmament the stars and the moon show his character show his handiwork and then this is what it does day under day utter of speech and not in a night show with knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard he continues says in them he have said a tabernacle for the son do you not see an image of the Bride that this is what God has called us to be that where our lives lived out that there's no speech or language where his voice has not been heard as you are the company that publishes the word of God you're the one that declares it the heavens declare the glory of God the firmament showeth his handiwork and it's speaking a language it's showing knowledge it's orderly it's in its place brother Branham again as I pick up on this and the greatest battle ever fought he says then I began to think that not one of those things gets out of their place they're all set in place this is the order of the Heavenly Host not one of them out of place he said if there's a move in anywhere of them it's for a cause and will affect this Earth we just see the results of it now from some of them moving into their spots it's effective it affects everything we see that in the tides and even how I believe it was brother Jason Watkins one time that expressed uh it's it seems something said that if the Earth was just kind of moved in its relation to the sun a little bit this way a little bit that way that it we could have been either too cold or too hot that God fixed us in a position and even the moving of the Earth on its axis and its rotation around the Sun creates the seasons so it affects things and I thought then if the great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order they don't keep their place if they don't keep their order he says what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it whole throws the whole thing out of cater the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit this is what Paul and brother man preached the same gospel that Paul preached and I say brother Brandon preached First Corinthians 14 and this is Paul recognizing the power that how God wants to use the gifts and how he can declare himself and manifest himself through the operation of the gifts therefore he's saying we must strive to keep the order of the spirit in Paul as he sets it forth he said God is not the author of confusion but of peace and God does not want to do things in the church in such a way to cause confusion so if we're going to do things let's do it under the edifine he's saying that the church as it operates on a local level in their church services he says when you come together the church should be a reflection of God's creation should be a reflection of God's character where there's form and there's order when God created there was form when God created there was an order we see it in nature that form an order they Reign they rule it's predictable because God is a god of order God is a god of structure God is a god of arrangement that's why he says women you learn from your husbands at home and he won't break that order because that's the way God does things there's an order and you'll find and this has been counsel given to me for even before I was a pastor even before I was ministering I remember a pastor sharing with me how that someone came to him uh for advice and he gave good advice but he broke the order that God God would have wanted it to be done in and in doing that God finds himself sometimes he can't bless even your desires if you don't honor his order and so God is a god of order we as opposed talking about the church and its characteristics should reflect this order this form we as individuals ought to do the same Abraham says in the sermon greater than Solomon's here says Pentecostal people let me say this with love that's the reason you're not getting anywhere you've got gifts he says you Baptist the same way and I love how he just he's wearing two gloves right equal rights and equal lefts Baptist the same way the gifts that's in the church God give the church the power but he never took it away from the church uh if anyone would want to get uh so full of unbelief to disregard and disavow the gifts brother Brandon's going to challenge it I can show you where he give it to the church you show me where he took it away this is the challenge he says you Baptist before brother Branham addresses the Pentecostal people he realizes I got to address the Baptist too because they may all be over there going yeah let them have yeah as soon as they said you Pentecostal people the Baptist said yeah and we got more baptic hostels in the message than anywhere and so he's got to he's going to get us on both ends so he says oh you say that let me say this with love and the Baptist start you know they get the popcorn right let me deal with you first you deny the gift say oh God took him out that was only given just to establish the church and there's a lot of dispensationalist and God took it away and that was only for the apostles he says he gave it to the church he didn't take it away now he addresses the Pentecostals you've got the power but you don't know how to use it you're not reverent enough that's the reason you're all speaking with tongues you just use it anyway some be speaking in tongues others doing this and just like a Babylon he says don't do that put things in their places put all the gifts in there your teachers your apostles put everything in its place and then operate in decency in an order you'll find God is a god of order and he'll bring the thing right up then this is where you'll edify this is where you'll build up this is where things will be strengthened as when the power that God put in the church you let it operate according to its character the gifts that's in the church God put them there he never took them away but he says you're not reverent enough it says you'll find that God is the god of order God identifies himself by order God identifies himself by things being in their place so if you change the order you change the meaning you change if you change the order maybe I should say this when you change the order you change the image and when the image changes the messaging changes if God is a God if he's an invisible God and he's made known by his characteristics and then you just you change the order of those characteristics it presents an image of God that's not true and then the messaging is wrong it Causes Chaos it causes confusion after you'll turn in your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 4 I I just this identification and I know that might feel a little chopped off but I held some back just to resurface these things in the future Services as we deal with this so that we could kind of follow the same template God is made known by his characteristics if I do not the works of my father believe me not if I do not operate in the character of God and Paul sets the Corinthian Church in order by saying we've got to manifest the character nature of God God is a god of order the proof of the into one of the spirit is that you acknowledge and follow that the the there's God's a god of structure God of arrangement now that doesn't mean that God is uh formal in the sense that it's so rigid it's so structured it becomes sterile but God's a god of order God's a god of precision and if you change the order you change you change God's meaning and it becomes chaos or confusion now in Isaiah Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2 we've been emphasizing this quite a bit and I apologize uh to those who are only catching this service alone if it leaves a lot to be desired but he says in Isaiah Chapter 4 verses one and two and in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach and we see this image of the culmination of Satan's Eden the climax of Satan's agenda that now through seven Church ages we've built a queen of Satan a bride of Satan identified through even these Seven Ages that the the daughter of a harlot and they want to be called Christians they want the name but they don't want the word and focusing on verse two as we have much in the past in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel let's look at this for a moment the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious this is the order and the character of the Church of God this is the order and the character of the Bride brother Brown in the sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealed himself in the same now I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful to our God he's talking about the changes that had been made at the Tabernacle and how they're rededicating the church after some remodel has been done and certain things have been moved around and he's looking at the maybe the outside and the way things would present externally said this is great this is fine uh having a new backdrop is great and it's got my back always uh and and there's there's things we said this is nice this is really good but that's not what makes the church a church and he says this he says we have a duty to make the inside right by the grace of God and we say the inside right it's not this hey this is good though I like this but that's not the end making the inside right making the ends of it has to do with a feeling a welcoming Spirit a character of God that that is as welcome in here he says this will just all not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people that's the real beauty of a Church's character that's the rest where the real power is is in the character I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty that's that when it comes from the character of the people there's a lot of things externally that think that churches can have her that we can manufacture oh we love the gingerbread right it gets our eye the curb appeal and those are things that might seem kind of good but that has nothing to do with Glory that has nothing to do with power that has nothing to do with the real Beauty the beauty of the church is the character of the people and that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful that speaks of character it shall be glorious that means honor Splendor dignity reverence reputation to be glorious speaks of character this is this is order now in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man and let's just review that for a minute seven women taking hold of one man saying we'll eat our own food and wear our own clothes but give us your name they want his name but they want to eat what they want to eat they want to wear what they want to wear they want the name but they want their own expression what they feed on nurtures their nature what they what they feed on is the nurture what what they're what they're wearing is an expression of their nature so they don't want to change what they feed on and what they manifest the nurture and the nature we want the name but we don't want anything else to change and by taking on the name and continuing to nurture a particular way in manifest a particular way causes confusion because the character wouldn't properly identify the name let me have your name but let me eat my own bread and wear my own apparel it goes back to Faith and works being husband and wife and so you take someone who has the works and they call themselves a Christian but you can't find their husband anywhere you can't find them feeding them you can't find them dressing them you can't find them dwelling there but they have a lot of talk to try to show it up they all know we're in a Christian Church we're a Christian church but you can't find the word in their midst it's only lip service and that's what brother Bradham said when he when he addresses something whenever you try to show that they're anti-word they're excuses well we get results don't we and they want to go to the works but they don't have deity in their midst because they haven't welcomed and received the word and when they have the name but they don't have they have their own expression it causes confusion good it's the same confusion when brother man says if a man can't produce his wife you can doubt his claim if the woman has the name but doesn't have any other characteristic or attribute of being married that causes confusion and God is using the character of women to identify the disorder and Chaos of the time in Isaiah chapter 4. he's using the woman now let me be very clear about this the rebuke of the women is the rebuke of the man so the men aren't escaping by it's just like brother but I'm saying you Pentecostals and all the Baptists go right they don't realize but they're part of it too they're getting their correction too God is using the character of women to identify the disorder and Chaos of the age because the woman identifies the character of the man I think about that very deeply in the sermon the chosen of a bride we should be wrapping up here pretty soon I think oh wait never mind maybe not I didn't realize what page I was on he says in the chosen of a bride he says the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character so a man's ambition and character is something that we would say is an imprint on his soul and that this is something internal but now there's his Works will declare his character and now the woman that he chooses shows what's in the man if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife I'm wanting to think about this very very deeply that what is when a man chooses a woman that it's a reflection of him it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he married now some people may be listening to this and think that's a death sentence but it's a challenge that if you have if you believe your principal and you have character then it's your responsibility to bring that out you have it is incumbent upon the man to bring that out but it's a reflection a woman is a reflection of a man's character so when God in Isaiah chapter 4 is rebuking the women of that age the men can't just be able to have these women they've sure made a mess of things yep always the woman it would come back on the men because they are a reflection of the failure of the fathers a reflection of the failure of the men so the women are reflecting the age and when it says seven women the seven women in this reflect the spirit that was on that age they're religious yet rebellious against headship there was a harshness there there was a stubbornness brother Branham in the sermon Oneness so we could see that how this this symmetry to the end times he says I've got thus saith the Lord 30 years ago when I entered the ministry he told me that the strain of women would come so immoral and imputed in the last days they'd be the most defiled thing on the Earth right she started it at the beginning and Satan used her at the end and look what's happening look down through the years said she'll continue to strip herself and said there'll just be a tiny a little tiny group of the very elected that's predestinated we'll Escape that when the vision come I was worried then I thought women I turned back over in the Bible to Isaiah I believe I think he says the fifth chapter but it's the fourth chapter and it said the branch that has escaped from the daughters of Zion and that day will be beautiful to the Lord so he was drawn to this very scripture to identify the condition of women in the last days the seven women will take a hold of one man want to eat their own bread and wear their own apparel and by name be called a Christian church but he says the strain is so immoral that God used women at the beginning Satan used women at the beginning he uses her at the end but there'll be a tiny group that escapes the branch will escape the daughters of Zion will be beautiful there's only seven women expressed something about the spirit on the age but them that are escaped they're the ones that escape the spirit of the age they're the ones that escape the judgments that come upon the age now her Escape is by judgment her Escape is by purging her Escape is by the word but she escapes the punishment that's coming upon the age she will be delivered as Isaiah chapter 1 prophesied brother Branham says in the invisible unit of the bride of Christ I read these statements Wednesday night a portion of these Now Catch the part just before this because you're talking about the bride having a Revival notice this character when you see women just go on the Rampage just doing anything they want to do watch the church is doing the same thing notice but watch them the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival look at how different these characters are one is just doing whatever they want to do but the spiritual bride when she begins to have Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect this is the message that they acknowledge and follow well there's a spirit on the age that's causing the women to Rampage and just do anything they want to and this is magnified in the churches church is a woman it's a it's a type of a woman so whatever the woman is doing in society the churches are guilty of the same way in Christendom and he's saying there'll be a message to put that in order there'll be a message to catch the elector out in the chaos and that's the message that they acknowledge and follow and that's your Revival and not the traditions of men that have made it into something that's not but your Revival is when you catch the word acknowledge it and line up with it that's the message the promise for this day he continues in the same sermon it happened the same thing when Pentecostal first started they dropped them women right back in line with the word and then they Drift Away there she goes right back over into chaos he's looking at that layout of seeing age he's looking at that movement and he's recognizing there's a disorder to it where it just lends itself to chaos it becomes confusion they let down the bars the women begin to run things this drop right back women were in line with the word when the restoration of the gifts came but now they begin to drift away drift away from Holiness drift away from the order of the word of God but then the time that the people are ready to line up there is a message comes forth and they line with it this is the voice of Revelation Revelations 18 4 diagnosing the the cancer in organized religion diagnosing the evil spirit that's in spiritual Babylon dietel showed us exposing mystery Babylon exposing the Antichrist and that voice cried out come out from amongst are my people that you be not partakers of her plagues and brother Adam says what a warning when he catches this scripture what a warning that throws the church exactly back to Revelations 3 14 to the laodicean age lawlessness real religious but lawlessness no order No Authority the due course the right order the spirit of the prophets is no longer subject to the prophet now as we've kind of just going back quickly over those things in Isaiah chapter 4 I'd like to turn a corner now and this is where I thought it was a moment ago when I thought I was finishing so just seven minutes behind schedule and Isaiah the content catch the context of this is we just read it in verse one and at that day seven we should take hold of one man and the branch of Lord shall be beautiful glorious there's your contrast in Isaiah chapter 3 is the context for this and let's just look at verse 16. can you follow me in this for a little bit brother Brown took Isaiah chapter 4 and made it a uh end time scripture this is relevant to us now this is the context for these seven women this is what the seven women are doing and this is a contrast to the one bride moreover the Lord Lord saith because the daughters of Zion are haughty that means they're arrogant and walk with stretch forth next it's this pretense right by outward appearance they want to appear taller they want to appear better and so this is the pretense of the woman they're arrogant and they're concerned about their appearance the way they appear and wanton eyes it's a the word speaks of an ogling to make the eyes glance about but a lot of the translations I even think in the Greek render it they walk with painted eyes walking and mincing as they go that meantime is to take quick little steps and even fashion will tell you that walking with high heels causes you to make shorter strides and they're mincing as they go and I won't demonstrate mincing I could do it with a sharp knife but he says and making a tinkling with their feet ornaments about their feet too to to make noise to draw attention and what the the prophet is showing us is that there's this pride of beauty there is this infatuation with the outward adorning and what we could identify is the pretense of Satan in the beginning who's all about the show who's all about the big things and all about the glamor and all about the glitz and all about the things that we think May our breed we are pretty glorious and even when brother Brahm is preaching the Seventh Son he says man something like this you'd think it would be in a big Cathedral somewhere you're thinking have this kind of manifestation this kind of look he says it's so humble you're looking right over the top of it it's not something with the ankle bracelets and bells jingle and it's not with neck stuck out there's it's not this image that's being portrayed in these women where they're under the influence of satanic design the music as they mince and the dancing and the tinkling of their feet the stretch forth next and this is because they're haughty walking with stretch forth next mincing as they go verse 17 therefore the Lord will will Smite with the scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion and the Lord will discover their secret parts I'm gonna I'll be ending I want to read the next verses to verse 24. man I I want to pause for a moment and I want you all to ponder that for a second these women are going to be smitten in the head and the crown of their head is going to be a scab he smites the head with baldness showing that the women have rejected headship and they're losing their Glory think of how significant when we come over to the New Testament even how significant a woman's covering is and what her hair represents and then this attitude he smites the scab their head the crown of their head with the scab it means he smites them with baldness now again I'm going to leave this with you so you can chew on this for a little bit but the Syriac and Arabic Arabic translations render it this way he's going to take away that which distinguishes their sex now you now you chew on that spiritually think about this that in this day the Lord has allowed the curse and the delusion to become so strong it's eradicating the difference between a man and a woman and you might think oh well that's good because I don't I don't wear flannels and and Levi's as a woman and uh and Doc Martin Boots and you might think you're doing pretty good but there's an image there's an image of a woman that's out of her place and it has to do with headship to the word and headship to her husband and when she gets out of order she is taking the very thing that distinguishes who she are who she is and takes away her distinction and God is saying the Lord will Smite them in their head and cause them to lose their Glory that which distinguishes them who they really are and this is the condition of the modern day this is the condition of the modern confusion and brothers identifies that men wanted to become women women want to become men and in a complete eradication of the distinction and the characteristics between a man and a woman he'll Smite them and cause them to lose their glory and their distinction you think it I know that I'm very careful not to weigh in on these things I think I've mentioned it before but it's absolutely happened to where now women are realizing they're fourth class citizens is the phrase that's being used because it's men men who identify as women women who identify as men and then real women and they become fourth class they're they're gone womanhood's broke relegated to fourth class and then he says I'm going to strip them naked because he says the Lord will discover their secret parts this brings us to laodicean age revelation 3. where they're rich increase with Goods their necks are stuck out they think they have everything but he exposes The Emperor's New Clothes strips them naked the Lord will discover their secret Parts I know that strong language and notice what he's going to do in that day the Lord will take away The Bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their calls and that and they're and as it's uh looking how that they do their hair and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the Mufflers the bonnets the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings the Rings and nose Jewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins the glasses and the fine linen in the hoods and the veils and they'll succumbed to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle of rent and instead of well-set hair baldness instead of a stomacher a gird in a sackcloth and burning instead of beauty there's a lot of confusion about what's beautiful a lot of confusion about what real power is but brother Brown takes this very scripture and he brings it down to our end times in the flashing red light of the sign of his coming this is the purging this is the judgment these are the seven women who want to eat their own bread and wear their own apparel but when he says the branch Lord shall be beautiful this is what they escape them that escape this is these are the ones that acknowledge and hear the word of God and if it be by the spirit of burning their Purge If It Be by the spirit of Correction they're corrected but this is what they're corrected to about brother Brown in the sermon the flashing red light of the sign of his coming Eve got from behind the word of God and that caused every heartache every graveyard every sin that was ever committed started right there here it is again what women were the cause of the first fall and women ends up the end time she started it she ends it now that's true in the evil sense she started it she ends it let me just say this you have something to say about the end no wonder the Bible said those that escape out of Zion shall be glorious in the sight of the Lord he's bringing it right back to Isaiah 4. women started at the beginning she ends it but there's those that escape in Isaiah 4 he talked about how the immorals of the women would get in the last days and how to be such so much clothes that they'd have and they'd have set have to set their hair set and everything like that the Bible speaks that in Isaiah 3 how she'd walk with high-heeled shoes on this is how he characterizes it remember how I think it was uh brother Brown's mom who had the dream I had this woman with high-heeled shoes was trying to walk and brother I said sister you can't you can't walk that way without that on and as she began to walk he got narrower and narrower as you walk up Mount Zion it gets narrow and narrow as you walk up the statue of a perfect man it gets narrow and narrow I know there's parts of us that want to think well that's just old-fashioned that's just funny daddy that's just a clothesline religion listen there's a purpose to Holiness there's a reason why brother Branham taught men to dress up the way off the dress to act away out the dress present themselves a certain way there's a reason why he asked the women to do it a certain way and the chaos you see in the world today is the very reason why the word of God was so plain and preserved so that we could sanctify our spirits and our homes to not be influenced and identified with the spirit that's on the world today to try to make our men look like women and our women like men they said sister you can't walk this way with those shoes on listen that's not old-fashioned funny dirty that's the word of God he says you let the women walk with high-heeled shoes Tink on her feet as she went along and she would roll down their stockings and things she'd do and how many changeable said apparel and stuff like that he's quoting Isaiah 3. and all that will be taken away from her and she shall sit and stink from immoral set her hair baldness instead of a stomach or girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty and said even seven women this is where it comes Isaiah 4. seven women will grab one man and said we'll do our own work this is how brother Brandon describes it we'll do our own work it says well I'll eat my own bread and I'll wear my own apparel but what does that take they've got their own Works they've got their own idea how it ought to be done they've got their own way that they want to present things but the word of God is discarded because God has an image that he wants to protect and uphold he says we'll do our own work let us just take your name to take away our reproach but he said how glorious will that little branch that escape all these things it'll be Holiness unto the Lord in that day when real genuine born-again women know their place though they be laughed at and called silly in old-fashioned and everything but act like a woman like a lady stand like a woman dress like a woman talk like a woman Live Like a Lady this is Kingdom identity now I know that may seem to be hard on the women but I'm not going to take the message of the hour I'm not going to take the scripture and use it as a bully Club to beat up the woman but I will use the word of God to beat up the bully who's trying to bully the women and the women we could take time to go through each one of these things how much pressure is put on the women to the spirit that's on this age and when it says that real genuine born-again women know their place a man has just as much a responsibility of finding that as the woman does Brothers if you could come to your instruments let me close with this in Isaiah chapter 1 verses 24 to 27. women need to act like women men need to act like men there's so many scriptures and quotes here I'm leaving out where Birdman brings it to the the both of us when it comes to the character Isaiah chapter 1 verses 24 to 27 therefore saith the Lord the Lord of hosts the mighty one of Israel ah our ease me of my adversaries and avenge me of my enemies the Lord is going to do this and I will turn my hand upon thee and will purely Purge away thy draws and take away all thy 10. and it may seem like well this is this is the end this is there's going to be baldness there's going to be stink there's going to be this is going to be Calamity but notice what he says and I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counselors is at the beginning this is even going back before they rejected God afterward Thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful City that word has to come that order has to be observed the judging the discernment the counseling of the word of God then Thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful City Zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousness this is what I believe that every believer ought to desire is to be judged here first by the word and to have that Spirit of burning and that Spirit of purging to root out of me I know we've emphasized this over and over again when we dealt with the tares but Lord me I'm a microcosm of that field I'm a microcosm of the earth even Within Myself I represent a field in which things have been sown and Lord I believe that deep down on the inside you've left your mark within my soul but in my spirit in my mind and in this flesh there's so many other things so many other images and calls and round tires and such all these other things these wimples and crisping pins though it might project in a fashionable way for women what might it ought to look like for a man how does it look within my thinking in my mind I said oh Lord I will be redeemed with judgment and me who is your son I am going to be redeemed with righteousness and that means I want to be as I ought to be oh there I think that there's a this is something that's been I've been unsettled with because there are certain things that I'm rejoicing over and there's certain things that I think we have every right to praise God but oh let's not be load to sleep we have an adversary who is with every breath is making due use of every opportunity in very subtle ways to try to drag us down and tear us down and I know we ought to be positive and we're always looking to the good and we want to be built up with a positive gospel but I believe the word of God says I'm going to expose and discover their secret parts and I'm going to expose baldness and I say if there be anything in me that is not subject to the word of God if there be any part of me that's not being covered with righteousness then Lord I don't want to lull myself to sleep I don't want to worship my way into some False Image Lord I Want to Be Right [Applause] and there's a there's a false sense of security that we can derive from a particular momentum that we can do as people [Music] but I want him to have preeminence in God's way of redeeming us is through judging and through righteousness that stand together
