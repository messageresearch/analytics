TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we mentioned last Sunday we're starting a a Christmas series on the subject of hate and we're going to continue on that today we've asked the question in the first service looking at how Christ is our peace and the peace that he brings and we asked the question where's the peace Wednesday night we spoke on where's the love and we were looking at love as kind of the opposite of hate um as we used peace even as an opposite of hate we could see those uh those contrary emotions and even uh situations and so I want to just jump right into it do a little bit of review here at the outset just for a few minutes just to capture some things and then we'll just get deeper into the subject we've been defining hate as an intense negative emotional response so it's intense it's negative and it's an emotion uh towards someone or something so it's some kind of response you have to someone it's something you might have towards something and at the heart of this hate because we use the term sometimes I hate it when I'm late or I hate it when this happens I hate it when that happens and we're just kind of using it as a a word it's not necessarily intense though it does Express something negative but what I'm looking at is not just the phrase that we use in terms of hate but the real the real hate that is malicious that's spiteful that we experience sometimes this emotion uh you regard something with extreme ill will or you have a passionate aversion to something those are uh the words that we're talking about in terms of hate and one of the ways that it's best uh kind of describes to me is described to me that I best understand what this hate is it means to treat as an enemy and so if you hate someone they become your enemy and and to the one that you hate you appear as an enemy because of your hatred uh and that one that's hated may be like well I don't have a problem with them but they're my enemy because they have hate and so to that treating as an enemy and even that phrasing of enemy is very large in the scripture when it deals with hate and so I want to be sure that that's kind of in our minds as we go forward that if you hate something you treat it as if it's your enemy as If it threatens you and it could destroy you or take away from you something that you love and we looked at on Wednesday especially that there is a hate that precedes love for God in other words there's a hate that comes after a love for God and this hate is a rooted in we could say agape love and it's a love for justice and righteousness and it's a love for the word and when you love the word and the more that you learn about the word the more you hate false ways and the more that you learn about the nature of God the more you detest evil and your love is going to be uh not going to be hypocritical you're going to uh cleave to that which is good you're going to love the word of God and then in doing so you're going to be horrified by evil or hate evil and so there is a hate in the scripture that uh we ought to have but it comes after our love for God and Amos 5: 14 and 15 it says seek good and not evil and and I I just realized I didn't give you you kind of my my title for today is where's the strength a and I'm thinking where's the power where's the Vitality where's the life where's the living where's the strength and so it says seek good and not evil that you may live and I I see this image of Vitality and life and strength there seek good and not evil that you may live and so the Lord the god of hosts shall be with you as you have spoken hate the evil and love the good so here's a explicit commandment to hate and I know some of you might just write down that Heart Alone hate the evil and then that's kind of subjective as far as you're concerned you can determine what is evil and therefore what you can hate but it's saying hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate it may be that the Lord God of host will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph notice these Commandments uh to seek good and not evil and as you seek good you're to love the good and then as a companion to that it says hate the evil and if I could say this the proper hate of evil is not possible possible without the right kind of love for good you can say well I just hate evil things I just hate wickedness and you can be full of hate for things that appear bad or things that you believe are wicked and I would even say that you could hate things that are truly Wicked and Abominations in the eyes of God but that hate can never be correct unless you first have the right kind of love for God so this hate that we're told to have for evil is not possible without loving the good because it must be a hate that is motivated by love a hate that's coming from a good place a hate that's coming from a safe place a hate that's coming from a higher grer emotion that's not destructive but Redemptive because if we just have a a carnal hate then we would just eradicate we would destroy and we would we would we would Vanquish anything associated with it but that's not the love that we that's not the ruling emotion that we ought to have we can hate the evil as long as we love the good so there is a hate that comes after the love for God and the love for his word now looking at had a different kind of hate in Galatians 5: 20 and I believe we'll come back to uh some of the verses surrounding this later on and hopefully give some more uh context to it but it's describing the uh The Works of the Flesh and it's referring to adultery and fornication and uncleanness and lasciviousness and we might be thinking uh wow that's uh this those are pretty strong words but then it it gets into idolatry and and witchcraft and we might be feeling pretty good so far in all this especially some of the young people be think man I'm checking off all the boxes and then it says hatred and it's like oh and then variance and some of these words are all tied together once it gets to hatred hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies and it's describing all the works of the flesh which Paul says and no and I've told you before that people who do these things cannot inherit the kingdom of God and so this is a real forceful comments that he's making but this is uh this hatred that's referred to here is a hatred that's driven by an improper love if we just use it for convenience that there's an agape love but then there's also human loves and human emotions and affections in lust and so this is a hatred that's driven by lust uh it's driven by aggression and these are the things that are motivating your motivation isn't the same when you love something and then hate something as a consequence this is driven solely uh by an improper emotions and even as it says hatred and invariance that's debate contention Strife it gets into emulations and wrath and the anger that follows these things so these are all things kind of connected together and related to hatred but this hatred we'll call it hate or we could call it hatred this hate is not of God as Amos said hate the evil and love the good that's not the hatred that's referred to here that is a work of the flesh this hatred is not of God it's that which is opposite and against love so there's a hatred that complement love and that that's we've acknowledged that we even spent some time on that earlier this year but now we're looking at a hate that is actually not a compliment but against and contrary to love it's actually opposes love and this love is rooted in human passions and emotions uh it's based upon our own human perceptions and opinions and our own judgment as Amos said establish judgment in the gate it's not your opinion but Justice righteousness the right things and so these this is uh this hatred is rooted in our human ideas and opinions and the fruits of it are wrath and disgust and H I can't stand that and I wish this would happen I wish that would happen that's what we're talking about when we talk about hatred uh take into consideration all the things that the Bible says especially in 1 Corinthians 13 what love is and how that love is patient and it's kind and that love is not proud it's not arrogant it's not self-serving and all these descriptions of Love inform us about what love is but we can also invert and understand those are the negatives are true of hate that it is prideful it's arrogant it's selfish it's all those things it's not patient it's not it's destructive it doesn't believe all things and hope for all things it it it this is it's the opposite in that way to to love and so hate is prideful it's arrogant it's it's wrathful it's driven by disgust and it's self-serving it's very selfish and in Galatians when it says hatred it's talking about the cause of hate or the cause of enmity or com combative means to be hated or odious opposing another this is a work of the flesh for hatred and this word hatred is very unique in the New Testament I find a different word in the Old Testament but yet the same meaning Rings true in Matthew Chapter 13 in the parable the SE when the the the one that went out and sowed the Bad Seed Jesus calls that one the enemy and the word that's used there is the ha a hater or it's tied to this is the wck this one that did the enemy is the devil and the word their enemy comes from this very word hatred it's described as hatred here in Galatians 5:20 but the devil is associated with hate and that's what we looked at on Wednesday night about the Genesis and the origin of hate that there's a hate that is a fleshly emotion that traces right back to Cain traces right back to the Devil Himself and so as we look at that word hate also think in terms of enemies opposing uh Warfare in Acts 13:10 and Paul saying oh full of all subtlety and all Mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and this enemy of all righteousness this word enemy is connected to this word enity or hatred and it's an enemy of righteousness it's a hater of righteousness why why is why is this evil an enemy to righteousness because evil hates righteousness therefore it's an enemy and it says will not not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord it's it's this hatred that perverts and destroys and corrupts James writing it this way in James 4:4 ye adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the Friendship of the world is enity with God it's hatred to God he says whosoever therefore be a friend of the world is the enemy of God this is this is speaking of opposition and things that are contrary and things that are combative and uh that that pervert the right ways of the Lord You're an enemy to God and so the hate that we're wanting to address the Genesis of this hate is evil and there we must have a so I can put it this way there's a uh there's you can hate evil or you can have an evil hate good amen and remember if you hate evil it has to be rooted in the right the love for good so this Genesis of this evil there's a pure hatred for evil but there's also an evil hate and we're addressing this evil hate that grips us sometimes and I'm wanting you to understand its destructive nature brother baman referring to uh this scripture here in Galatians and he quotes off the works of the flesh he says and the fruit of the enemy is enmity hatred malice strife and so forth so there's a a grouping together of a lot of words we might say hate and we might say anger or malice or Strife or contention a and those words I want to group them together they're Associated together with hatred and he says the fruit of the enemy is enmity hatred malice strife and so forth that's the fruit of the enemy it's a fruit of hate it's the fruit of these emotions we're talking about and and just to kind of reset here the origin of hate is the devil right we saw that in the garden we see it then coming up in in Cain towards Abel and we hate this evil hate we have that when we've left love so hate is only possible when the love leaves a vacuum or we move away away from love and we create a vacuum and hate can enter there this evil hate can enter there and it can begin to work so we can only have evil hate where love isn't reigning Supreme and so when we have that hate once we hate it's hate that robs us of our peace so as long as you have love and you're channeled correctly there's all these fruits of the spirit that we can enjoy but once you give a vacuum and hate enters in hate now having taking it Taking the place of love and we move just a little left of center it's there that robs us and steals from us our peace that that I think that kind of gets us all on the same page this morning now if you turn to Proverbs chapter 15 vers 17 and 18 I want to start looking at this nasty side of hate and asking the question where's the strength where's your power what's the source of your power how is it that we can overcome we know that the Bible teaches us the word teaches us that Christ overcame all by the word and humility in Proverbs 15:1 17 better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith the plainest of meals with peace is preferred over the most delicious food with Strife or with hate just a plain language it's better to have a dinner of herbs it's better to have a dinner of herbs that are are simple they're easily grown they're readily available you just go pick some off and too bitter we'll eat that it's better just to have something like that something that all common people could have something that you can grow without effort it's better to have a dinner solely of herbs where love is than a stalled Ox which is referring to an ax that's been fattened this would be the highest form of entertainment in the scripture this would be putting on the dog as brother Barry would say this would be the biggest most extravagant thing you could do as a host and it's saying it's better just to eat measly herbs that you pull out of the ground that you don't even grow yourself self than to eat the best food with hatred and it connects it to the verse next verse is connected with it a wrathful man stirreth up Strife but he that is slow to anger appeaseth Strife amen so this hatred love then is looked at as kind of this opposite of what will uh what will smooth out and what will be consolatory and and be willing to to seek peace and restore and to keep things in the right Channel and the right at atmosphere but this hatred now is associated with wrath and strife and anger and it is better to eat a plain meal of the poor with peace and love than it would be to have great wonderful things and entertainment enjoy life with hatred because hate stirs up contention hate stirs up competition and and envy and strife it stirs up confusion in every evil work and when you read this some of you are thinking that's our Thanksgiving Day scripture right this describes this should be the what we should we should send out Happy Thanksgiving cards and put the scripture on it h because it so readily captivates some people's dread of Thanksgiving because you sit down and man you've worked for days to put on this great big beautiful meal and people just fight and they they argue and they come up with things to be competitive about and they saying that it's better the Bible's telling us long before there was Thanksgiving meals that it's better just to eat a simple meal with love than it would be to put on Thanksgiving dinner with strife and hatred and it just doesn't say at one time it Revisited it later in Proverbs 17:1 better is a dry morsel in quietness therewith peace tranquility than a house full of sacrifices with Strife this is remarkable equivocation this to me is such an outstanding comparison and contrast it's better to have a dry mold and this would be referred to bad bread it's better to have bad bread in peace than a house full of sacrifices with Strife right and this might turn this might be turning some of our paradigms around or maybe just reminding of us what our real Paradigm is when we're seeking after things to make life better we're seeking after things that give us uh more Capital to purchase the things we want and we're able to accumulate a house full of sacrifices we're able to have what it says are stalled Ox every night for dinner and we might have the this kind of finery and these wonderful amenities to life but yet what does it come with because that's not preferred over having nothing but dried bread and bitter herbs but with Tranquility quietness and peace and love because where there's strife and anger it doesn't make it worth it and the the comparison that's being made here is how that boo that excuse me food maybe there is boo but food is good food is good for the body it's it food is the body's source of energy where we in the Bible meat and bread sometimes are just being used to refer to solely the things that we eat to Su sustain ourselves and so food is how the body gets energy for life it's where it gets its nutrients for strength and for Vitality uh how can you how can you have power if you haven't eaten your meat might be the question and so you have to you have to eat and you have to give your body these nutrients if you're not eating food your body is not going to have energy or strength and so it's it's important and that and I want you to recognize what the Proverbs are doing here by you bringing food into The View when it says well eating this with love is better than eating this with hate it's wanting us to consider something about the dispos disposition and the nature of love versus hate and how that even if you're just eating a little with love it's better than eating a lot or better things uh with with hate in First Kings chapter 19:8 we read of how Elijah was there uh at the brook cherith and God sends these Ravens to feed him and and in his weakness and his Sadness the angel Lord touches him he says arise and eat and drink and the Bible says he went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights into horb the Mount of God showing that the the the this food this provision just these simple things that he received gave his body strength that's what food does it gives us strength the strength of that meat carried Elijah for 40 days and 40 nights and so when we read the Proverbs using dry bread in herbs with love being better and more preferred to a house full of sacrifices and a stalled Ox being slain for a great Sumptuous meal and great big entertainment these Proverbs are pointing to the destructive nature of hate right want us to understand that there is such a power to hate that if it's no matter what we may be eating physically thinking it's going to sustain us hate has the power to Rob us of the very strength we're wanting to get from the things we eat says in Proverbs 10:12 hateth stirreth up stries but love coverthe does a wrathful man stirreth up strife and but he that is slow to anger appeases Strife it's showing this contrast of how better is a dinner where love is where there's one who's slow to anger who will appease Strife who will look to Plate uh a contention and want to resolve things and not and be a peacemaker say this is better this is more preferred because hate stir up stries stir up contention and this hate and this is maybe my thesis statement hate steals our strength it's a LIF draining emotion we're supposed to be getting uh we're supposed to have energy and we're talking about physical energy we're talking about mental acuity and just the way the body functions and we're we're to have this just by a natural process but hate has the ability to interrupt the body's natural process and drain us of emotions hate is a toxin to our minds and bodies hate is a poison hate is a Venom and it attacks us even physically and emotionally and the Bible is showing us right here you'd be better eating just a little and eating stuff you can pull out of the ground with love than to be having all the best foods you could possibly eat and hate therewi because hate is destructive as we saw in the scripture peace leads to prosperity whereas the hatred leads to Warfare and hostility which leads to loss and destruction hate is destructive true turn to Proverbs chap 26: 21-28 with me we reading in Galatians how that Paul is saying that uh we should not use our Liberty as an occasion to the flesh but we ought to love one another and serve one another and that even the whole law is summed up in love thy neighbor as thyself but then he says if you bite and devour one another so maybe there's an eating that we do when we hate and this eating is something that counteracts and works against us because he says take he that you be not consumed one of so there's a consumption a a and there's a destruction that comes with this contention and strife and this language to me here is just so beautiful in Proverbs 26: 21 as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire what is that fuel coals to coals there's burning coals and you add coals then that ignites and the coal that is not lit is lit by the burning coals and as wood to fire you add wood to fire what does it do it fuels it makes it hotter makes it burn greater so is a contentious man to Kindle Strife what a a remarkable description contentious man is one who's judgmental or quarreling one who's adversarial contrarian maybe so is a contentious man to Kindle Strife that where you recognize that it's almost as if it describes someone who's just sitting there and all a sudden notices Oo we have a disagreement here well well didn't you say two people kind of argue well you did say this he did say that I heard him say it I can show you right here where he said it and then the guy gets mad he goes well but you did say that and you did say and they just love to see it get hotter and hotter and this contentious man he likes to stir up for Kindle which means to cause to burn or to be angry Strife is contention to content to dispute what is happening it's it's a it's a hater right this is exactly what so is he that contentious man do Kindle Strife dispute to content he likes to stir things up and now the just continuing to describe this it says the words of a tail Bearer are his wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly these things are linked together I know they can stand on their own but these things are linking together burning lips and a wicked heart are like a postd covered with silver draws burning with hate and anger spe viewing out hatred and and threats maybe seeking revenge or trying to uh uh uh avenge something or seeking harm stirring up Strife wanting things to burn and this is this attitude of someone who's full of this rage or this anger or hate burning lips in a wicked heart it may speak certain things and express certain things it's like a postr which is just an earth and vessel covered with silver draw in other words there's no value at all in hate amen the burning lips in a wicked heart there's might be some pretense to it where it might be flashy and it presents itself of all this thing is silver this but what it is it's just Earth and Clay covered up in the dross of silver to make it look like something it's not that's what hate is there's no value in hate and you say well where are you getting this hate from verse 24 he that hateth dissemble which is to covers up it's conceals or hides dissemble with his lips and layeth up deceit within him he might pretend to be a friend but his hate will come out he that hates is known is saying he that hates is known by his words even the next verse shows us and hatred is full of arrogance hatred is full of Pride and So eventually it comes out no matter what the pretense no matter how words might be friendly and it might give this appearance it's like this Earth and vessel covered in silver draws it is what it is on on the inside he holds his deceit within him that's the holding place that's the vessel that holds it it says he'll he'll try to cover up he'll say things to try to to make it seem a certain way but just know he might pretend and sometimes hate might put on a lot of HS but on the inside there's no value to it says when he speaketh Fair believe him not for there are seven Abominations in his heart that brings us right back to hate right whose hatred is covered by deceit so where there's hate there's deceit they they go together his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation now that's what that's kind of amplifying how he dissembles with his lips and these burning lips and a wicked heart or like aost her it's kind of those few verses taken together say you know what hatred may appear one way but give it time it comes out because that's what it does and it's saying hate whose hatred is covered by deceit hate causes lying because where there's hate it it'll callous our conscience and our conscience is blinded by hate so we justify our line to the point to where we may not even recognize that we're lying I know this just gets real super practical all of a sudden we realize wow this is sometimes the reason why we act the way that we do is that the heart of it is hate and so we don't have a problem lying because we hate and the object of our hate said they're not worthy of Truth they don't deserve it why should I be honest with them why why why should I treat them a certain way the way they treated me and uh they don't deserve for me to do this they don't deserve for me to do that that's hate now this gets really really good talking about the hater and talking about hate who so diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a stone it will return upon him when you dig a pit it's a trap not for yourself but for someone else when it's describing he that rolleth a stone it's not referring to a rock band from the 60s and 70s I think there's still going 2020s but it's referring to an act of aggression or assault where you would roll a stone up on a hill to send it down upon somebody else of their property this is this is kind of shocking language but it's saying the one that digs a pit he'll fall into the pit he TR he laid a snare in a trap for somebody else he falls in it he rolls a stone up the hill in order to roll the stone down upon somebody else but he says it returns upon him it's showing us the destructive nature of the hate that we hold within ourselves with the deceit we carry within ourselves because it's saying that our hateful actions in the end only serve to harm us or if I can say maybe not only but in the end our hateful actions serve to harm ourselves hatred will build a pit but hatred will put you right in the same pit you you dug hatred will roll a stone on top of a hill to harm somebody else but the stone will only return upon you even if it has itself succeeded in harming somebody else hatred will always return upon the hater to harm the hater says a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it we lie because we hate and it's saying we hate the ones we lie to a Lyon tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a flattering mouth worketh ruin I know there's a lot more that we could explore in this but we lie because we hate and we hate those we lie lied too now you might not think this is the the wisdom of the scripture you might not think I didn't lied to him because I hated him but you end up hating the one you lied to because you expect Revenge if they find out think of this what the scripture is trying to show us that you when you tell a lie it'll be the seeds of hate against someone that you love because the human emotions will begin to work up the defense and the explanation the justif and the story you want to build around it and it'll work you around to hate the one you've lied to expecting them to hate you to be mad at you and get vengeance upon you because you lied come on can I get a little bit louder amen I don't mind the Wows but this I know this hits home I I and but I I want this you to recognize just how practical the word of God is and just how much it exposes these things in our hearts and how much God desires for us to live free from these things that de base us and tear us down and harm us and the Bible's just calling it out you you you if you if you tell a lie it leads to hate you say well I didn't hate to begin with well just let it run its course it's what happens as we read before in Hebrews 12: 14 and 15 says follow peace with all men I think we only read verse 14 I follow peace with all men I think it was one of the core scriptures last Sunday and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord work to understand others I think even how the the the word picture that's described there's cultivate a good understanding of other people don't just look them out on the surface and disagree with them need jerk and gr them off and get contentious or adversarial but work to understand others avoid Prejudice and envy don't feed the emotions that lead to strife and argument and fighting says follow peace with all men something that we ought to pursue after eagerly pursue after this piece and this peace we know is the opposite of hate it is the opposite of hostility and notice what we're told is it's telling us to follow peace it's telling us to flee hate because this is what hatred causes looking diligently verse 15 looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled where who is troubled the hater right and the hater is going to hate so it many are defiled by your hate but you're troubled too hatred causes bitterness hostility only grows our resentment this is connected now follow peace with all men in other words isue hatred don't hate because it'll cause a root of bitterness to spring up in you and trouble many yourself and defile many good amen this is I'm wanting to catch what hatred does now I think reading in Proverbs 15 and Proverbs 17 told us a lot about hate and how it's going to take it steals our strength it robs us of our peace it steals our strength we saw how it inflames and imp passions and it causes things to escalate in Proverbs 14:17 he that is soon angry dealth foolishly when we allow our hatred to uh cause WRA or even we allow our anger to seep into a hatred he that is soon angry dealth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated we must not we cannot be quick to hate because hate breeds more hate he that is soon angry deal it foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated hate breeds more hate it drags down it degrades if you could I hopefully I think all the scriptures we're continue to use this morning are going to emphasize this point uh Booker T Washington said it this way and it's so beautifully put I will permit permit no man to narrow and degrade My Soul by making me hate him what beautiful words this might be a better contribution than peanut butter uh to say I will permit no man to narrow and degrade My Soul by making me hate him amen let that resonate a little with you because he's pointing out as the scriptures are point out that to hate Narrows your soul to hate degrades your soul when you hate it shrinks you down when you hate it makes you it reduces your power reduces your integrity reduces your character I won't let any man narrow and degrade My Soul by making me hate him you cannot provoke me to hate he's identifying as the scripture does a man of wicked devices is hated that wickedness is actually trying to make you hate it's trying to provoke you into the wrong kind of emotions and it says that lest any root of bitterness spring and up trouble you this root of bitterness could have been translated to sprout of poison I know root of bitterness we might just think oh it's just something that's doesn't taste just right or maybe it's a little sour but this root of bitterness is a is a springing up of poison its companion in the Old Testament comes from the Hebrew rash which denoted the poison or Venom of serpents when Paul is writing he's not just merely saying that oh don't let something bitter and sour grapes and you know if life gives you lemons then make lemonade it's not just this kind of positive upbeat thing he's trying to rep pull away any Veil from your eyes to recognize just how nasty bitterness is or how how nasty hatred is he's saying lest a sprout of poison that poison and Venom of the serpent himself the poison of Satan yeah let it not spring up in you because it will trouble you and the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother bam brings it right down to this poison he says if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me have the root of bitterness springing up because it will affect him and it will take the Christ right out of my life that if you have a root of bitterness you're as the Bible told us in Proverbs 26 it's going to come out no matter how much you try to hide no matter how much you try to look like a silver a silver pot you're really just an earn vessel that's uh that's doesn't have integrity it's going to come out it's going to break am and and brother Bram backing it up says that we should not have a root root of bitterness spring up because it will defile others he says now this to me is the most important part because we say well the rooted will trouble you yeah I'm just troubled today no your trouble is that that it'll take Christ right out of your life it's not I'm having a bad day it's I'm having the worst of days because it takes Christ right out of our life he says that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred the Prophet The Prophet bringing us right down to what the root of bitterness means it's the poison it's a Venom it's poison acids that eat up and corrode poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred you're the one that holds the malice you're the one that holds the hatred this poison acid is in you it'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you amen it'll run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here those are strong words to recognize that these malice and jealousy and hatred this hate that we're wanting to use as kind of a cover for all these things that we're talking talking about it will poison you and drive Christ right out of your life he says they'll do it to a church amen it happens because these poison acids that phrase there to me is so descriptive Mark Twain said anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured amen that's good hatred will do more harm to you who holds it in your heart than the one you project your hatred too yeah it's a poison acid in your heart you're holding it In Your Vessel and after all you're just a poster you can't handle this acid you're not going to survive it you may think you're getting away from with it but it's eating at you all the while in eroding hate is a costic poison it erodes and when he says a poison acid this costic poison a poison acid as it's being described here it's capable of burning and destroying organic tissue it's corrosive hatred is costic it corrodes it's a poison acid he says that burns and destroys he says organic the even destroys our organic tissue now I'm I think the most important thing is to recognize how that hate will drive Christ out of your life who is our strength Drive the Holy Spirit right out of our life is upon which we rely upon which animates us and it's him in us both the will and to do of his good pleasure and it's through him that we have this strength and vitality and hat just comes in as a blocker comes as a as a dam to that fountain that we should be feeding from and that to me may be the most important highlight but there's also the the to further emphasize how hatred is a poison my original title that I began to work with was hate is a Cancer and I even wanted to maybe title a whole series not even cancer and just preach all of it on how hate is like a cancer it's a sickness in Proverbs 14: 29 and 30 he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding that this is showing that if you know how to control your emotions and and if you're not slow to anger you won't be quick to hate it's something where you're able to moderate and regulate and control you're looking at these things you recognize how things can spring up you even able to identify the seeds of hate and you know how to control that he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding but he that is ha of spirit exalteth Folly it's going to come out going to act a certain way a sound heart is the life of the flesh but Envy the rotness of the bones amen a sound heart is one that is free from hate or envy and evil passions sound heart is one that's not quick to wrath and one that's not Hasty to Spirit so a sound heart is one that's free from these passions and a sound heart these emotional seat a sound heart maintains the strength and the health of the body amen a sound heart is the life of the flesh so it's not just talking about your emotions anymore it's saying your emotions are a key to good physical health but Envy which is jealous or anger jealousy or anger against someone it speaks of anger and resentment and hate it says it it's rotness of the bones it rots your health good your hate may be projected to someone or something but it prays on your own body prays on your own Spirit it wastes the flesh it weakens and consumes the stronger parts of your bodies notice it says if you have this hatred in your heart it rots the bones the strongest part of your body the sound hard is the life of the flesh but hatred will rot even the stronger parts of your body one person called it the moth within W just lives inside eating things up and now I know this is very familiar to most of you we've dealt with this some when we were speaking on uh Christ my healer and we're dealing with forgiveness but hatred leads to other toxic emotions and hatred and well I think next Sunday maybe we'll touch on this a little bit more hatred is rooted in fear yes a a and with hatred comes an anxiety and this the these emotions that are all connected together that might start snowballing whether it begins with this and ends up with that we're wanting to look this whole picture these are things that stress the Mind begin to stress the body causing long-term physical health conditions causing long-term mental health problems because this anger this rage we're talking about this hatred this resentment and bitterness it'll actually cause more real harm than what we hate sometimes we hate something because we're afraid of what it'll do to us but our hatred for it sometimes causes more real harm harm to the very thing we're afraid of that's PR that makes sense right you're afraid this is going to hurt you so you build up hatred towards it you're building up resentment towards it because you don't want it to hurt you and it's your hatred that hurts you more than what you hate ever could because hatred is a costic poison it decays it erodes it destroys our spiritual and emotional and mental and physical health we know that uh This Hate as we're using it maybe as a catch off word but even anger I know you guys are familiar with this uh the the the physiological process in the body that hate causes the release of cortisol it's a stress hormone and it's the release of this hormone that kind of gives you the the the the energy the the uh Adrenaline Rush the energy that you need to in a particular situation and it gives you energy to run or gives you energy to fight it's kind of cortisol is what kind of kicks in as a survival Instinct so it's good but too much of it is bad and scientifically they' can bear this out and show it that this too much of this cortisol causes a multitude of negative effects upon the body and the scripture is saying it's rotness in the bones brother B calls it poison acids and Malice and and these things and this too much cortisol causes an imbalance all these different things imbalance in blood sugar it can suppress thyroid function and decrease bone density well I think the Proverbs already told us that go ahead measure the bone density of that person that's hating so much that's interesting their bone density is decreasing oh that's interesting the Proverbs told us that's exactly what happens it's a hormonal imbalance that impacts the body's immune system so now we're looking at hate as the root cause of your hurt of your sickness of your health problems this one uh study concluded this way research shows that chronic chronic angry people suffer more frequent colds flu infections asthma skin disease flareups and arthritis as compared to non-chronic angry people it sounds kind of politically correct non-chronic angry people we would call them mad people that are always angry people that are haters people that are negative peevish crotchety right that brother say I don't want my life to be crowned as a a a a critical a complaining old man and these things come to create these problems in the flesh we read from the sermon why in that series before I think we've probably read this quite a few times here at the church in just a few years says our number one heart disease so the number one Killer's heart disease says the main thing that kills the people today he said and he said it's one heart disease doesn't kind of the way he says it you see a little bit of the fragment but we know know that he's referring to what we believe to be the number one killer scientifically but he says it's number one sin disease why do we have heart disease he saying sin disease sin is unbelief unbelief in what the Bible that's right yes it's the number one sin disase that disease that kills the people today both spiritually and and that'll make them kill them physically of course because they can already prove he said this in 1963 they can already prove so there's some uh tracing this back to some sort of process that has determined causation not just correlation so they can already prove that man that holds grudges in women who fuss and stew this is this agitation this resentment this IR being irritated holding grudges this bitterness this hatred who fuss and stew and fight and argue they die it'll cause cancer fungus everything will set in ulcers brother bram's telling us this is the reality of hate this is the reality of grudges and resentment and bitterness that holding these feelings of hate and anger create as the scientists will say a chronic state of anxiety and stress and these things are toxic to your health and as you hold that and bear that in your body that elevates uh certain levels of hormones and cortisol and that's been proven to increase the risk of heart disease and this hatred we they've done a lot of stud and here they're calling it a chronic angry person again politically correct chronic angry people and you know hatred is deeper than anger and if anger will do that and it's not even being equivocated to hatred what will hatred do to us and as we covered before in preaching on forgiveness brother BR says they can already prove and we at that time we went through several studies over the past five decades since brother brownon made that statement research has uncovered a link between a person's physical health and their resentment and their bitterness and not being willing to forgive and we read in a number of places that people who are refused to forgive they're constantly angry they still hate they still want Vengeance that their health decays whereas people who were quick to forgive or learn to forgive had better health outcomes and they've amassed volumes and volumes of evidence of physical and psychological benefits of being able to forgive and there's a lot of connection between forgiveness and hatred as we read before this study on the effects of forgiveness from Hope College in good old Michigan it says forgiveness May free the wounded person from a prison of hurt and vengful emotion so now think of the opposite of what happens when you're when you still hold on yielding both emotional and physical benefits including reduced stress less negative emotion fewer cardiovascular problems and improved immune system performance we're dropping back just a little bit to get into the science of the scripture when it tells us better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hate therewith because hatred corrupts hatred destroys brother Bram says it'll cause cancer fungus ulcers the sound heart is the life of flesh but the Envy is rotness of the bones it's a it's atic poison it's poison acid hate itself is a cancer it spreads and destroys healthy tissue spiritually and physically cancer grows new cells divides itself divides other cell the nastiness of cancer we're all familiar with probably in our own personal ways cancer has this ability to hide from the immune system some researchers call cancer Immortal because of its nature that's true one study said there's evidence to show that suppressed anger can be a precursor to the development of cancer and also a factor in its progression after diagnosis in 1975 they did a study and found that there was a statistical significant statistical relationship between extreme suppressed anger and breast cancer now you might say well this is this is stepping into the realm of science did we have we not given you a basis enough in the word of God to now realize that some of these Health outcomes can be traced to Stress and Anxiety hatred bitterness malice having an unforgiving heart and this hate now it's like a cancer I want us to recognize this solely how that hate is robbing us chipping away us it should be enough to know that hatred will drive Christ from our lives hatred to drive the Holy Spirit out our lives he says it'll it'll kill the spirit of God and drive it away from the church he said hatred is a nasty thing these poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred oh don't let it ever be In Your Vessel amen cuz the spiritual consequences are enough and then look it also robs us of the strength and vitality of our natural bodies brother Brandon when he's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ in 1960 he says little isms I remember before how we mentioned this about DC Stevenson he was the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Clan and grew it to the largest Clan membership and the most powerful clan in all the the nation was in Indiana and and he was expressing his ideals he said I did not sell the clan in Indiana on hatreds I sold it on americanism his success was praying upon people's fears and their desire to blame their problems on other people and they found other groups to blame things on and all he had to do is sell it on America first I did not sell the clan in Indiana on hatreds I sold it on americanism and brother B says little isms and little funny feelings around you for Brethren and things like that shake it away brother Bram was grew up in a hot bed of these things he was affected by it he saw it these little isms he says don't let no root of bitterness ever get into your soul if you do it'll canker you notice how brother Bram is telling us to think about what it'll do these root Ro of bitterness these little isms he says keep love I don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow I don't care how much people hate you don't let them narrow and degrade your soul by making you hate them no matter how bad people treat you don't let them narrow and degrade your life and your strength and your power by making them hate you you hate them no matter how bad it is these little isms and funny feelings he says keep loving your heart don't let their hate turn you into a hater he says it'll canker you which means to corrode or corrupt and a canker was the original word word we used for cancer it is a spreading ulcer and brother Bram said they'll cause cancer fungus everything also said in ulcers because this is what hate is it's a cancer a cancer that prays on our strength divides our cells weakens our immune system in Proverbs 16:32 with in light of this hate hope seeing hate is the custic poison that it is in our bodies and our Spirits the Bible says he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city amen there's a lot of different ways you could say this but let's just say it's easier to subdue the enemy without right than it is the Enemy Within it's easier to hate than to love and the enemy is the hate an enemy there is associated when there's hate you've made something in your enemy you've made yourself an enemy to someone else just by your hate does it require the other person to hate right you say the enemy of my enemy is my friend is the way some people say it if you hate somebody then you're the enemy to them and you've made them your enemy even if there's no hate in their heart they're not the really the enemy or the hater it's in you he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that take the city many warriors have con conquered their enemies only to fall victim to their own passions it said even of Alexander who could conquer Kingdom after Kingdom after Kingdom but he let his own hatred and rage caus him to kill his most trusted and best friend one saying put it this way he's more of a hero who has conquered himself than he who has taken the best fortified City you're more of an overcomer you're more of a conqueror when you could conquer yourself amen when you can overcome these emotions when you can begin to recognize them and be slow to wrath and you can begin to recognize how the devil's trying to provoke you listen I would not want any of you to be condemned If you experience anger and wrath and jealousy and envy or even hatred I'm just want you to recognize how that you ought to by The Life of Christ that's inside of you deal with those things and address those things in your heart because those things are the root cause of a lot of other things we have to come to that place where we recognize where our power lies and what we want to have power over and how we want to channel the energy of the Holy Spirit and not just giving vent to our hatred giving vent to our malice giving vent to how we feel about certain things just looking for some kind of Outlet or Channel but we want to be slow to anger we want to rule our Spirits because he who can rule his own spirit is stronger and more of an overcomer more Victor victorious than one who could actually conquer a city you're a better Warrior when you can can control your temper you're stronger you're more healthy when you can rule your own Spirit Amen brother BR in the Seal of the Antichrist we're coming to uh we're coming to our close here if that means anything to you in the Seal of the antichrist's dealing with physical workup and emotion he says not because we dance or we're happy or shouting that doesn't mean I mean it the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience that's it people shout dance in the spirit and hate their neighbor and refuse to speak to one another this is brother brandom just trying to show you something right that you could have all of this still hate your neighbor and what has all this what good has all this been all the exercise all the workup all the display it was nothing but imposter with silver drw there was really no value in it cuz he's saying you could do all that and look great big and powerful oh my goodness the holy spirit's moving so strong but then you just walk right out the door and hate your neighbor where's the victory in that won't speak to one another where's the power and that that's why I asked the question where's the strength where's the real overcoming where's the real power what are we looking for to know that the power of God is working in my life where are we looking to know that the word of God is effective in my life where are we looking to know that the strength of God is at the heart of my life amen what litus test do we use we come to church just so full of rage and hatred and we're so Ste oh my goodness If I Could Just Kill Them I would kill him if I could if I wasn't a Christian if if they didn't have so much science today to figure this out CSI if I you didn't exist kill him and so the music gets to move and you're like yeah yeah you get all pumped up and excited and you give vent to your hatred right you feeling pretty pretty good I got it out I feel better come on and you still hate your neighbor cuz you've never addressed anything really I'm going to read a lengthy part lengthy statement here from God hiding himself in Simplicity than revealing himself in the same I don't have this uh the quote here I may have another slide or two uh on this but just just stay focused with me as we wrap this up all right and he's talking about these extremes and these sides he says other can go so far as to be Fanatics now they go on the other side so you might have those stayed anti- emotion dry-eyed confessions kind of just some way that maybe it might be described maybe some might call it a fundamentalist or intellectualism whatever the ism people might want to put in a category but you do have the wrong extremes and I said but then there's another side which is just as bad as the other side right they're just might as well just realize they're both in the same thing they just have different ways of seeing it said I think that just because they they and they think just because they jump up and down and get some kind of sensation or emotion speak with tongues or give a prophecy that happened to be right happen to be right like a broken clocks right twice a day or something like that they think that it's that they've got it but it isn't Jesus said many will come to me in that day say Lord have I not prophesied in your name your name done many wonderful works and cast out Devils he said depart I never knew you that isn't it that isn't it friends that's the reason that tongues tongues evidence I believe in speaking in tongues but I don't take it to be the only of the Holy Spirit no sir the fruit of the spirit is the evidence right he amplifies this quite a bit you see that's the reason I have different with the move of the Pentecostal bre in the manner that they say if a man speaks in tongues he has the Holy Ghost I different that's no sign he's got the Holy Ghost I've heard Devils speak with tongues just as fast as they could drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil I've seen Indians take snakes and wrap around them in the rain dance out there in Arizona hold their hands up like that and run right around the witch doctor come out Lancing himself lay a pencil down and it write in unknown tongues and give the interpretation so don't tell me that no I'm too old for that the fruit of the spirit is Jesus said by their fruits not tongues or emotions but by their fruits you shall know them so the fruit of the spirit it's God unfolding himself in humility sweetness and every day the same amen it's something about a man that stays right with the word this is the real evidence he's showing us stays right with the word every time that he sees the word he punctuates it with an amen no matter what the other people say he believes it amen what is it unfolding in humility and sweetness amen but we go far enough than to rest upon a fanatical and Satan gets amongst the people that's Satan's business and he's a good businessman and he gets amongst the people notice this is how he works gets amongst the people to make them think they've got it because they can jump up and down and then hate your neighbor now how Bram just quickly comes in with an objection and it's it's really as you could see some of this it's one objection yes okay fine you're you're claiming that this is genuine and this is real and you're having a Revival and everything's great and everything's wonderful and because you can jump manifest in all these physical ways he says but do you still hate your neighbor good because if you do that's not what it is because you can have all that and not have anything but when you can have a genuine love of God for his word that's it no matter what what no matter what it's looking like in terms of how it compares to this over here that's what you want is this God unfold himself in humility and sweetness hatred usurps our humility and because it hatred taking away our humility it strips us of our power amen because brother Bram says power is in sweetness and humility so brother said God unfold himself in humility and Sweetness in other words God unfold himself in power and power he said is in sweetness and humility says in another place if anything that we want to be is humble because that's the secret to power is through humility but just as love is humble and love is not self-serving and love is not arrogant doesn't boast and puff up but hatred does and therefore hatred is what usurps and destroys and BS us of our strength as we close in Galatians 5: 22- 26 brother Bram keeps quoting this over and over but the fruit of the spirit is love peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness you what meekness is not weakness meekness is power under control meekness is what Booker T Washington was wanting right that when a man is trying to get me to hate him I know I could and I know I could avenge and I know I could do harm and I know I could get back and I've got power to show this guy who he's messing with but meekness is power under control amen I mean if you really are Weak and Powerless and can be destroyed that's not meekness that's just reality but meekness is the one who when struck he could fight back but he turns the other cheek as if to say you don't rule me you're not my boss you're not in control of me and he he objects in a way that keeps his passions under control he's not going to resort to the same response he's not going to give himself over to hate and this is the fruit of the spirit that has something to do with our character something to do with way we're living Our Lives God unfold himself in humility and sweetness and every day the same staying right with the word of God meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that of Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts so it says if we live in the spirit if quickened as we did this in the Kingdom series if quickened then follow his guidance amen and all your tempers and all your thoughts and all your words and all his actions if having been quickened by the spirit live walk and be moderated and guided and led by the spirit because that is the kingdom he says let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another desires of V Glory it's eager for empty Glory being petty peevish contentious argumentative don't be desirous of vain Glory vain glory is it's behind our contentions it's be behind our fights and our disagreements the vain Glory of being right vain Glory of getting it correct the vain Glory of getting things uh uh put in the right place for something that's just Petty provoking one or means to challenge one to a contest or combat envying one another prompted to Envy which comes from the base meaning to corrupt destroy or waste it takes our power away hate is a poison hate is a cancer that's drawing away resources spiritually physically emotionally mentally physically hate it could be that some of us at the very root of our biggest problems right now is this kind of hate good we just won't let it go we just won't give it up and it eats at us and eats at us and eats at us and maybe there's a lot of other things in our lives that are right and you're doing right things and you're doing things that you ought to do as a Christian and you can go back to the year and preview like I'm I'm going to church I'm paying my ti I'm giving my offerings I'm supporting missions I'm doing devotions at my home I'm doing everything I can and there's a lot of things in your right that's in your life that you're doing right but the holy spirit is saying now with that kind of basis with that kind of strength with that kind of experience can we not focus on on something that is a real problem and we put a bullseye on hate brothers if you could come to your instruments my last statement to you is from the sermon humble thyself I know that we've heard it here before and we can only operate as we let and God can only operate as we let him operate just th follow my words here as we don't have the quote there for you maybe he can only operate as we let him operate there's that yielding to him you know people want power and really don't know what power is where's the strength it's not an anger it's not an aggression it's not in boasting it's not in bluffing where's where's our power they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking worldly thoughts of Vengeance and Justice and fairness and equity and wrath and anger get away from your worldly thing and humble P yourself before God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise there's more power in that than all that others that we can see because you've been able to conquer Yourself by being slow to anger by ruling your own Spirit you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogancy a church just sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it Arizona Believers Church no pretense no posturing no platitudes and platforms we try to present ourselves a a as being more powerful or better than something else just humble yourselves before God don't be arrogant don't be boastful don't puff yourself up he says a church that's sweet and and humble is a church that has favor and the power of God and he says that's right that's the thing it takes humility humble ourselves before God letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise if I could just put it to you this way as we close that God I I've been studying in Psalms 27 so maybe we'll just move uh some of these scriptures of the principles there in Psalms 27 he says the Lord is the strength of My Life whom shall I be afraid he he found strength in Christ he found strength in God and it changed his whole approach to even his enemies and the host that encamps about him he didn't say I'm going to seek after an atomic bomb to hurt him and to hurt him and hurt him and destroy him and I'm G dig up dirt on him and dig up dirt on him and I'm gonna do this to him and do that to him he did it to me I'm going do it to him he just said I just want you Lord that's what I'm going to seek after just want you because God and he had to turn to him and yield to him and it's that one thing have I desired the Lord of God is the is my light and my Sal ation the Lord is the strength of my life so I will not fear he's my deliverer he's my Vitality he's my stength and he cannot dwell in hate and that's what brother Adam showed us when he said these poison acids he just takes a step takes a step away because he says I can't be there I can't be in that I'm not in that even if you're hating the right thing in other words you're hating something that is evil but if it's the wrong hate he can't be in it God doesn't blow up abortion clinics the devil does that God doesn't bully a sinner the devil does that God doesn't degrade and demean the devil does that but sometimes he's trying to use God's language to do it we shouldn't be drawn off Ides by it this hate is a poison acid it is a Cancer and I believe that as Believers nothing can stand in the way if we believe not even cancer amen let's find the source of source of our strength stand with me today
