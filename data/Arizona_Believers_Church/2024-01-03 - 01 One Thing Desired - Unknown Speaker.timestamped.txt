[0:00] as we mentioned this want to start a new
[0:02] series on the house of the Lord I'm
[0:04] still learning how to minister and how
[0:06] to preach and so I'm constantly just
[0:08] wanting to yield myself to the Lord just
[0:10] to find the right way to approach a
[0:12] subject I find that when I begin to look
[0:14] at one I've been studying this now for
[0:15] quite some time I just there's just so
[0:17] much in the word of God in really any
[0:19] aspect of the word because you can
[0:21] always bring it back to Jesus Christ and
[0:23] it just starts spreading out and getting
[0:25] very very large and so sometimes you
[0:27] look at it and you go oh we can start
[0:29] here and just you keep doing this and
[0:31] drilling down this way and drilling down
[0:32] that way and I feel in some ways you
[0:34] just look at one aspect and you can
[0:36] never actually get to where it is you
[0:38] thought you were going and what that
[0:39] inspiration is and so I'm just
[0:41] confessing that at the outset that if I
[0:43] don't get anywhere I'm very self-aware
[0:45] and just believe that there's always
[0:47] something in the word of God for us to
[0:48] take a hold of and to be benefited by
[0:50] and I really only desire to preach the
[0:53] things that'll glorify God and edify his
[0:55] bride and so be in prayer with us on
[0:57] this subject uh of the House of the the
[1:00] Lord and I want to give a title tonight
[1:02] one thing desired I'm taking it right
[1:04] out of the the word here in Psalm 27 one
[1:07] thing desired I'm going to use tonight
[1:10] as an opportunity just to kind of get my
[1:12] materials out but give some context to
[1:15] what I'm looking at in terms of the
[1:17] house of the Lord and something that God
[1:19] began to deal with me on over the last
[1:21] month or so in terms of value I've
[1:23] actually been asking myself uh what is
[1:25] it that God values and are there certain
[1:28] things in the word of God that we could
[1:30] uh look at and conclude that based upon
[1:32] his attitude and based upon what he's
[1:35] expressed in the message of the hour
[1:36] expressed in the word that we could take
[1:38] away from that this is something God
[1:40] values and if God values it that should
[1:42] signal something to us and so those are
[1:44] some of the things I've been thinking
[1:46] about that I think will hold kind of uh
[1:49] you you can see where I'm coming from as
[1:51] we go forward now if you'll just look at
[1:52] verse four I want to start here Psalms
[1:55] 27:4 and there's just real large context
[1:59] to this verse verse as we've already
[2:00] read before this and a little bit after
[2:02] I love this text as being prophecy about
[2:05] the Rapture his brother bam takes it
[2:07] when he preaches the Rapture message
[2:09] when he takes that he says I'm not going
[2:10] to go down Main Street and take kind of
[2:12] the obvious angle to this I'm going to
[2:13] approach it a little bit differently and
[2:15] so I believe that him taking this kind
[2:17] of places this as a prophecy of the time
[2:20] that we're living in when the Lord
[2:22] himself has descended with a shout the
[2:24] living bread of life bringing forth the
[2:26] bride there's a lot of things there uh
[2:29] that are very very
[2:30] uh important to us but I want to focus
[2:32] tonight uh and and this is where I'm
[2:35] kind of with the was kind of giving you
[2:36] the qualification at the beginning I
[2:38] could get lost in a lot of these other
[2:39] details so tonight I'm actually just
[2:41] going to try to zero in on one thing out
[2:43] of this and here he says it in Psalms
[2:45] 274 one thing have I desired of the Lord
[2:49] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[2:52] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[2:55] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[2:58] and to inquire in his Temple now that
[3:00] phrasing this is that I may dwell in the
[3:03] house of the Lord all the days of my
[3:07] life and with that he paints this
[3:09] picture to behold the beauty of the Lord
[3:11] I Hope to come back to that at the very
[3:13] end maybe and to inquire in his Temple
[3:15] so much to this as we've already
[3:17] mentioned that we could bring out and
[3:18] that we could begin to explore but as I
[3:20] zero in on this one aspect he says one
[3:23] thing have I desired so we can say it
[3:25] this way he desired one thing I think uh
[3:29] just follow me tonight stay very close
[3:31] to my words I I I hope this has some
[3:33] tremendous impact and we can uh kind of
[3:35] wrestle with it a little bit as families
[3:37] and just individuals as a way of really
[3:39] challenging ourselves in the faith to
[3:42] stay for going forward with God so he
[3:44] says one thing have I desired so he had
[3:46] one main object that was his constant
[3:48] wish this was something that he just was
[3:51] the ruling desire of his heart so it's
[3:54] quite a statement to say I only want one
[3:56] thing and I know it could be said of a
[3:58] number of different ways where say say
[3:59] well this is the only thing I want
[4:01] that's the only thing I want but really
[4:02] it's kind of like when you ask people
[4:04] what do they want for Christmas I only
[4:05] want one thing and then this one thing
[4:07] and then this one thing and this one
[4:09] thing they say I only wanted one thing
[4:11] but one of each right and so there's
[4:14] this there's this expression that
[4:16] there's only one desire that rules me
[4:18] there's only one main objective and and
[4:20] constant wish and constant prayer and as
[4:23] I meditated on this I found for him to
[4:26] say one thing have I desired it implies
[4:29] some exclusion to say I desire one thing
[4:33] you have to say well that's the one
[4:34] thing he desired and if he says he only
[4:36] desires one thing then he's excluded a
[4:38] lot of other desires could you think
[4:40] about that for a moment he says there's
[4:42] one thing I long after one thing I
[4:44] desire more than being in in the palace
[4:47] more than being in his own home more
[4:49] than wealth or fame or power this one
[4:51] thing I desire it wasn't well I desire
[4:54] to have this car I desire to have this
[4:56] opportunity I desire to have the throne
[4:58] I desire to have a palace I desire to
[5:00] have a wife he said above all there's
[5:02] one thing so when he says there's one
[5:04] thing he desired it was excluding other
[5:07] things that could be
[5:09] desired and you could then conclude that
[5:11] if he desired this one thing that it
[5:14] would it would hurt him more to lose
[5:16] that one thing than it would to be to
[5:18] lose his throne than it would be to lose
[5:20] his family or to lose his health or to
[5:22] lose his riches or to lose his power so
[5:24] Desiring this one thing it would hurt
[5:26] more to lose that than it would to lose
[5:28] anything else are you thinking about
[5:30] this with me when he says one thing have
[5:32] I desired there's one thing
[5:36] desired so the climax of all of his
[5:38] prayers and uh that which he requested
[5:41] above all other things this this is the
[5:43] one thing he
[5:45] desired and so he says one thing have I
[5:47] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[5:50] after so he sought one thing you can
[5:53] think of it this way together he desired
[5:55] one thing he sought that one thing to
[5:58] say that he sought the one thing was the
[6:00] primary objective of his life it was
[6:02] that governing pursuit or this is my one
[6:05] aim this is my singular aim if anything
[6:07] else would keep me from achieving that I
[6:09] have to disregard it if anything else
[6:11] would deter me and would not be
[6:13] expedient for me obtaining that then I
[6:15] must disregard it and so for him to say
[6:18] and I hope this can really resonate with
[6:20] you for him to say I desire one thing
[6:23] and seek after one thing he's actually
[6:26] acknowledging the pretense we engage in
[6:28] sometimes when we say oh I put the Lord
[6:31] first and oh above everything else I
[6:34] love God and I I I love his word above
[6:36] all things when he says I desire one
[6:39] thing and that will I seek after he's
[6:41] acknowledging the vanity of lip service
[6:44] it's easy to say it and maybe it would
[6:46] have been very easy for him to say
[6:48] there's just one thing I desired and we
[6:49] just say y oh with all my heart I want
[6:51] to serve the Lord but I'm not really
[6:53] going to try so he's he he he's
[6:56] acknowledging something and I want to
[6:58] say it this way if the heart truly
[7:00] desires one thing then the one thing
[7:02] will be sought
[7:03] after we can say that we desire it but
[7:06] if we don't seek after it I mean really
[7:09] how bad do you want it what do you mean
[7:11] when you say you desired it does it does
[7:13] it even mean anything if the heart truly
[7:15] desires one thing then the one thing
[7:17] will be what we seek after he says one
[7:20] thing have I desired of the Lord in
[7:22] other words he desired one thing one
[7:24] thing desired one thing sought am it was
[7:27] a priority the one thing more important
[7:30] than anything else and I was thinking of
[7:33] this as I was just thinking about the
[7:35] language and the word one thing have I
[7:37] desire that will I seek after and I
[7:39] remember one time when I was in
[7:40] Minnesota ministering and I think it
[7:42] might have been the time that brother
[7:43] loyel was baptized and I was with a
[7:46] group of young people I was single at
[7:47] the time and there was um there was a a
[7:51] brother from Japan and his children were
[7:52] in the youth group there and uh someone
[7:55] said something about being hungry and
[7:57] then I can't remember if somebody said
[7:58] something and I asked him I said well
[8:00] how do you say really hungry in Japanese
[8:02] and he told me he was like e your emoji
[8:05] I was like what does that mean he goes
[8:06] number one hungry and I was like I love
[8:09] it like I'm number one hungry I'm not
[8:11] just hungry and I'm just I I eating is
[8:14] the third thing I can do it's like this
[8:15] is the first thing I need to do it's the
[8:17] first thing I want to do and and it kind
[8:20] of just placed in this thought and I
[8:21] just love the language of it and so when
[8:23] David says one thing have I desired of
[8:25] the Lord that will I seek after say this
[8:26] is the number one thing this this to me
[8:30] is what I
[8:31] desire and it is an expression of hunger
[8:34] it's an expression of desire and want
[8:37] and longing this is how God began to
[8:40] kind of bring some things together just
[8:42] very beautifully in my mind just to give
[8:43] me the confidence to minister on this
[8:45] tonight but it was also an expression of
[8:47] what David valued he says one thing have
[8:50] I desired Lord that will I seek after it
[8:53] spoke of something he highly esteemed or
[8:55] something that was of great importance
[8:57] to him so it was not not just uh an
[9:00] opinion of I think this is good and I
[9:04] like that and this is that that has that
[9:07] has value to it but spoke of something
[9:09] that was very important to Dave and I
[9:11] even feel in saying it that way that it
[9:13] loses some of its meaning when he says
[9:15] one thing I've desired that's at the
[9:17] exclusion of everything else that I've
[9:20] desired this more than food I've desired
[9:22] this more than houses I've desired this
[9:23] more than power I've desired this more
[9:25] than money there's one thing I've
[9:27] desired there's one thing that I will
[9:28] seek after in other words this is an
[9:30] expression of what I value the
[9:32] most he said in Psalms 20 Psalm 26:8
[9:36] Lord I have loved the habitation of thy
[9:39] house and the place where thine honor
[9:43] dwelleth I just love that phrase the
[9:45] place where thine honor dwell the place
[9:48] where the shakana glory rests and the
[9:51] place where his presence is pleased to
[9:53] manifest when he says that about the
[9:55] house I've loved the habitation of thy
[9:58] house in the the place where the shik
[10:00] glory is pleased to manifest itself the
[10:02] place where it finds rest this is an
[10:04] expression of value I love this place I
[10:07] love the habitation of thy
[10:09] house maybe if we spend more time on
[10:12] services in terms of talking about value
[10:14] there a lot of things that we use to
[10:16] measure value or what gives something
[10:18] worth and value but value is determined
[10:21] by the usefulness of something or the
[10:22] perceived usefulness of it and the
[10:25] capacity that it has to achieve good or
[10:27] to bring good we've value something it
[10:29] has importance it has worth and and if
[10:32] it has value and worth then you give it
[10:34] some place like in other words if if
[10:36] it's worth fighting for uh is it worth
[10:39] keeping is it worth striving for and
[10:41] when he says there's one thing I've
[10:43] desired it meant to him it was the most
[10:45] valuable
[10:46] thing and so in Matthew chap 6:
[10:51] 31-33 Jesus writes this therefore take
[10:55] no thought and it speaks of an
[10:57] anxiety or concern concerns so it says
[10:59] take no thought it's not that if you
[11:01] think about what you want to do for
[11:02] lunch you're like I'm such a sinner but
[11:04] it means that you shouldn't be anxious
[11:06] and nervous and worried therefore take
[11:08] no thought saying what shall we
[11:11] eat or what shall we drink or wherewith
[11:14] All Shall we be clothed now it's
[11:17] bringing into view uh some eating
[11:19] drinking clothing says for after all
[11:23] these things do the Gentiles seek and
[11:26] then I'll come back to that but then he
[11:27] makes this statement for your heavenly
[11:28] father father knoweth you have need of
[11:31] all these things so he wasn't
[11:33] trivializing what you're going to eat
[11:34] what you're going to wear what you're
[11:35] going to drink but he's saying your
[11:36] father knows not that you want those
[11:39] things but that you actually need those
[11:41] things and the heavenly father being
[11:43] mindful of them there's much larger
[11:45] context to it and how he clothes nature
[11:47] and he he feeds The Sparrows and things
[11:50] but here he's saying that you must that
[11:53] for the Gentiles after these things
[11:55] after all these things do the Gentiles
[11:57] seek I believe in Luke it says all other
[11:59] nations of the world they seek after
[12:01] these things but they engage it it kind
[12:04] of engages their intention they engage
[12:06] Supreme attention to these things it's
[12:09] what matters the most it's the chief
[12:11] good it's the only good what am I going
[12:13] to eat what am I going to drink what am
[12:15] I going to wear after these things it
[12:17] holds to the Gentiles to all the nations
[12:20] besides Israel so there's there's this
[12:22] idea of well this is for Israelites they
[12:24] had a God who made a promise that he
[12:25] would provide all these things to a
[12:27] gentile they have no such deity that
[12:29] they has made the promise nor could even
[12:31] fulfill the promise and so they have to
[12:33] look after themselves they they have to
[12:35] worry about what they're going to eat
[12:36] they have to worry about what they're
[12:37] going to wear they have to worry about
[12:38] what they're going to
[12:39] drink and so diligence to something as
[12:42] he says after these things do to the
[12:44] Gentiles seek diligence to something is
[12:46] a direct reflection of one's true desire
[12:49] towards it right that the Gentiles
[12:52] needed it and wanted it and valued it so
[12:54] they sought after it you catch that
[12:57] after these things do the G Gentiles
[12:59] seek and so their diligence to it spoke
[13:03] about in their hearts how much they
[13:05] thought about it how much they valued it
[13:07] their true desire towards those things
[13:10] was was met in their pursuit of them so
[13:15] Jesus comes to this in verse 33 but seek
[13:18] ye first the kingdom of God this is
[13:21] something we used in the last service I
[13:23] believe but seek ye first the kingdom of
[13:25] God one thing have I desired of the Lord
[13:27] one thing desired that will I seek after
[13:29] Jesus says after all these things do the
[13:32] Gentiles seek but now I speak to you and
[13:34] say seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[13:37] his
[13:38] righteousness and all these things shall
[13:42] be added unto
[13:43] you you recognize kind of some
[13:47] Singularity and
[13:48] multiplicity seek ye first the kingdom
[13:50] of God and all these things shall be
[13:53] added unto you so there is there there
[13:56] is this narrowing down now I put it this
[13:59] way God hides himself in
[14:01] Simplicity now I really hope you can
[14:04] focus intently tonight really engage in
[14:08] exercise of I'm going to focus very very
[14:11] uh intently and I I'm going to I'm going
[14:14] to try to you know block out anything
[14:16] that would distract me and I even say to
[14:18] the children try to settle yourselves
[14:20] right now give your parents some
[14:21] distance because I just feel very
[14:23] directed to say this concentrate because
[14:26] there's so much Supernatural power that
[14:28] can be un loosed Unleased to you if God
[14:32] can attack certain things by the word in
[14:34] your life that's holding you back so I
[14:36] know this is I know this is of the Lord
[14:38] here God hides in
[14:41] Simplicity and so the ultimate
[14:44] Simplicity is when all of our desires
[14:46] are reduced to
[14:48] one that's true he's CU now he's saying
[14:51] man you got all these things you need to
[14:52] worry about what you're going to eat
[14:54] what you're going to drink and what
[14:56] you'll wear now that doesn't mean that
[14:58] well there's only one thing to eat only
[15:00] one thing to drink and only one thing to
[15:01] wear think of all the Paradox the
[15:03] Paradox of choice and all the things to
[15:05] choose from I mean now it's like you can
[15:08] find something think about this and I
[15:10] don't mean this to be a joke to my
[15:11] family but you think of any if anything
[15:13] was healthy it'd be water right but now
[15:16] you can't even drink water if it's been
[15:17] in a plastic bottle right it's G to
[15:20] Water's going to kill you now and so
[15:22] think of all the pressures and things
[15:24] that we have to hurdle over and worry
[15:26] about and all the things we got to
[15:27] finagle around and navigate through says
[15:29] take no thought as to what you'll eat
[15:31] drink and be clothed with but now let's
[15:34] reduce it to this seek ye first the
[15:37] kingdom of
[15:38] God that's the ultimate Simplicity when
[15:42] you one thing is
[15:45] desired and I think that our ultimate
[15:47] aspiration should be uh should should be
[15:50] focused on a singular
[15:52] objective just as David says one thing
[15:54] have I desired when one thing desired
[15:57] means that my ultimate Pursuit and what
[15:59] I'm seeking after is something of a
[16:01] singular
[16:03] objective so if I could encourage you
[16:05] with this that this could be some sort
[16:07] of metric that you can use and some
[16:09] guiding principle in your life as that
[16:12] life should be the process of
[16:13] determining True Value we shouldn't be
[16:16] expected to know things of value and
[16:18] things of import and what what something
[16:20] is worth on day
[16:22] one uh a brother Owen is celebrating a
[16:25] birthday today I don't see him but he's
[16:27] celebrating a birthday today and we
[16:29] might all think that certain uh baseball
[16:31] cards and collectibles oh it's worth
[16:32] this it's worth that and I think even
[16:34] brother Lucas you experienced this
[16:36] recently said man I got a treasure Trove
[16:37] of cards here I've got to be sitting on
[16:39] a gold mine and somebody who's experienc
[16:42] and estimating the value of something go
[16:43] like that's a lot of cards but I'll give
[16:45] you 50 bucks for
[16:46] them I said well how do you know you're
[16:49] you're nothing but a kid I said but
[16:51] through time you
[16:53] learn the process of determining True
[16:56] Value and I and I one time was trying to
[16:59] collect every baseball card of Julio
[17:00] Franco bring them if you got them I'll
[17:02] take them and and yet for me they might
[17:05] have some value to it but to anyone else
[17:06] is like that card's worth 5 cents at the
[17:08] most and they look closer and say oh it
[17:10] was cut wrong it's not worth anything
[17:13] right and so there's a way that through
[17:15] life as you experience things I hope
[17:17] you're really thinking about this as you
[17:19] experience things as you grow we ought
[17:22] to become better at determining True
[17:25] Value and and as as the word in forms us
[17:28] as we increase in Revelation and
[17:30] experience we ought to be learning that
[17:32] this doesn't matter but this does this
[17:35] shouldn't really affect me but this
[17:37] should and as we grow in the Lord and as
[17:40] we live life should be the process of
[17:42] determining True Value and then that
[17:45] ought to lead us to more Simplicity
[17:49] amen life should be the process of
[17:51] learning what's true learning what's of
[17:54] True Value and as I learn what is
[17:56] valuable I learn to simplify my life to
[17:59] where my desires can be reduced to one
[18:02] CU God hides in Simplicity I want you
[18:05] realize God hides himself in Simplicity
[18:07] then reveals himself in that Simplicity
[18:10] and this would be the ultimate
[18:12] Simplicity when my desires are reduced
[18:14] to the God who hides himself in it amen
[18:18] in
[18:19] Simplicity if you could turn to 2
[18:21] Timothy chapter
[18:22] 2:22 this may be a directive only to
[18:25] brother Vincent as he cues up the slides
[18:26] but in our youth
[18:29] there are many things that receive our
[18:32] attention many things that catch our
[18:35] attention uh many things that we we we
[18:37] invest in and it it receives our time
[18:40] and our our our money and our thought
[18:42] and things that'll dominate our thoughts
[18:44] and sometimes maybe we could even think
[18:45] about the kinds of things that children
[18:47] think about or the things that teenagers
[18:48] are worried about the things that people
[18:50] in their early 20s and we might like to
[18:52] think well as a as an adult and as a
[18:54] grown man you know I don't think about
[18:56] that you don't worry about when you when
[18:57] you get to my age these are this is
[18:59] really when you see the full picture
[19:01] you've kind of narrowed down your
[19:02] desires and your wants and so there are
[19:04] certain things that pertain to Youth and
[19:07] in 2 Timothy 2:22 he says flee also
[19:11] youthful
[19:12] lust but follow righteousness Faith
[19:15] charity peace with them that call on the
[19:17] Lord out of a pure heart now the
[19:19] statement in the phrasing youthful lust
[19:22] these lust speak of a passion or craving
[19:25] uh like an inflaming wine that is
[19:28] intoxicating which influences your
[19:30] judgment and behavior so these lost or
[19:33] like a wine that intoxicate you and when
[19:35] you're intoxicated it influ influences
[19:36] your perception it influences your
[19:38] judgment and therefore it determines
[19:40] your it influences your Jud uh
[19:42] decision-making process and your actions
[19:45] your behavior so he says flee youthful
[19:48] lust and it means desires of a
[19:51] particular
[19:52] age a particular time of
[19:55] life suggesting that there's a
[19:58] there's a certain expectation when
[20:00] you're of a certain age if I could even
[20:02] say immature not fully grown and fully
[20:04] mature that there are certain
[20:05] Temptations and distractions that would
[20:07] be characteristic of that age uh if you
[20:10] come to church and you see a 5-year-old
[20:13] uh reading a reading a Richard scary uh
[20:17] busy town book and if you see a kid just
[20:19] kind of turned around in his chair and
[20:21] staring at the back and picking his nose
[20:22] you say well that's a 5-year-old right
[20:25] but if the deacons were doing that right
[20:28] if you go to the back and brother Mike's
[20:30] over there just in a where's Waldo right
[20:32] and he's just fullon you know looking
[20:35] and you'd be like well that's really
[20:37] that's really odd it it would kind of be
[20:39] mismatch because one would be expected
[20:41] of of a child but the other it wouldn't
[20:43] of it of any of us and right now
[20:46] somebody at home is
[20:49] like putting away there where wall
[20:51] where's Waldo
[20:56] gotcha but to say to flee and follow I
[21:01] want to put it's a challenge to mature
[21:03] right that these youthful lust desires
[21:06] that are indicative of immaturity and
[21:08] someone who's not fully grown and
[21:09] someone who hasn't lived life enough to
[21:11] know uh certain things and recognize
[21:13] certain things and to say to flee and to
[21:15] fall it's a challenge to mature and let
[21:17] me say this it's not physical de
[21:19] development but Spiritual
[21:21] Development it's about spiritual
[21:25] maturity it's not about achieving a
[21:27] particular age well when I turned 21 I I
[21:31] don't have youthful lust anymore no it's
[21:32] about growing in maturity spiritual
[21:35] maturity and so as we grow this is
[21:38] wanting to join with that force of how
[21:39] life is the process of determining True
[21:41] Value and then finding Simplicity as a
[21:44] result of it it leads to a narrowing
[21:45] down as we grow there should be a
[21:48] narrowing down of desire to one thing
[21:51] desired yes I'm speaking and not
[21:54] physical development but I'm speaking
[21:55] true spiritual maturity is the bride of
[21:57] Christ that as we grow in the word and
[21:59] we grow in Christ there should be a
[22:00] narrowing of desire to where I I have
[22:03] many desires there's many things I want
[22:04] but the more that I live in the word of
[22:06] God the more that I become acquainted
[22:08] with his presence the more that the word
[22:10] unfolds to me I find that it's not that
[22:12] I don't like those things or enjoy those
[22:14] things but I'm finding the more I live
[22:16] the more I'm growing up it's a narrowing
[22:19] of desire to one thing
[22:22] desired Paul says it this way in 1
[22:24] Corinthians 13:11 when I was a child I
[22:27] spake of as a child I understood as a
[22:30] child I thought as a child but when I
[22:33] became a man I put away childish
[22:37] things adulthood is marked by becoming
[22:41] not
[22:43] aging says when I became a man doesn't
[22:46] mean when I turned a certain age so this
[22:48] adulthood this maturity is marked by
[22:50] becoming not
[22:52] aging and it's when I became a man I put
[22:56] away so wherever there there is this
[22:59] this enveloping or this tying together
[23:01] of manhood and childish things you're
[23:04] still yet in the process because as you
[23:06] become a man you're putting away if you
[23:08] ever stop putting away then you you've
[23:10] stunted in your development you're a
[23:13] Manchild at
[23:14] Best But when I became a man I put away
[23:18] childish things this growing up in
[23:20] maturity maturity is marked by becoming
[23:23] as I become more mature in the word I'm
[23:26] putting away childish things
[23:28] more and the sermon what hearest thou
[23:31] Elijah brother Bram says I believe that
[23:33] we've been children long
[23:35] enough God's going to turn his church
[23:37] into manhood now and we played in Frolic
[23:42] as children we just kind of were Guided
[23:43] by our whims frol we just kind of bented
[23:46] about wherever our taste drove us but
[23:48] now we're going to have to put away
[23:50] childish things and take on manhood
[23:54] maturity it's remarkable when you put it
[23:56] that way that here's why one who's in a
[23:58] childlike State and is characterized by
[24:01] Childish things but when he finds it in
[24:03] him to take that childish thing and put
[24:06] it away by the act of putting it away it
[24:09] declares that there has been a maturing
[24:12] and there's been a becoming
[24:14] am as long as you're still wearing
[24:16] childish things and behaving childishly
[24:19] a a and putting on The Heirs of a child
[24:21] hey doesn't matter how much you try to
[24:22] claim you're a man or how much you try
[24:24] to claim that you're a mature believer
[24:26] as long as there's notot a child things
[24:28] in your life you haven't come to the
[24:29] maturity you've claimed to come to
[24:32] because you take on manhood by putting
[24:33] away childish
[24:36] things maybe as a shout out to Arya but
[24:39] I've been using all these uh poets as of
[24:41] late I just find there's a lot of Beauty
[24:43] in these things that have been inspired
[24:45] I'll spare you maybe reading the whole
[24:46] thing but in the Ode to duty that
[24:49] Williams Wordsworth wrote and I'm
[24:51] thinking maybe he's not really one of
[24:52] the greats cuz he doesn't have a third
[24:54] name but William woodsworth was speaking
[24:57] about
[24:58] uh the the the servant the one who hears
[25:00] the voice of God it's quite a remarkable
[25:03] poem and he he he's talking about uh his
[25:08] desires and he says I feel the weight of
[25:11] chance
[25:13] desires I what a statement it continues
[25:15] with the my hopes no more must change
[25:17] their name I long for a rest Repose that
[25:19] ever is the
[25:21] same and as he says it this way my hopes
[25:25] no more must change their name I long
[25:27] for Repose which is a rest that ever is
[25:29] the same he's describing what he means
[25:32] is I feel the weight of chance
[25:35] desires desires that come up essentially
[25:39] by
[25:39] chance and the world is full of these
[25:43] enticements where they they're
[25:45] indulgences of opportunity the best way
[25:48] I could describe it is that uh Labyrinth
[25:52] that we have to navigate at stores that
[25:55] are just lined with all these cheap
[25:56] items to get to the register to buy your
[25:59] essential item of
[26:01] milk I don't know if they you remember
[26:03] the Fries electronics and there'd be a
[26:06] half a mile Labyrinth of all these cheap
[26:08] cables and cords and all these things
[26:10] and you've got the one thing you
[26:11] absolutely need right and you have to go
[26:13] through you have to go through all this
[26:14] why are they trying these are chance
[26:16] desires they're there just by chance it
[26:20] could instigate an
[26:22] impulse and this writer should we give
[26:25] him a middle name William Will
[26:27] Wordsworth wor his his desires he's
[26:30] saying I I feel the burden of it I feel
[26:33] the pressure I feel the influence of
[26:36] these chance desires and that's how
[26:40] children are there's things that they do
[26:42] because it's impulse they don't know how
[26:44] to control it the Mind wants the Mind
[26:46] does the heart desires it follows and
[26:48] it's these things it's chance desires
[26:50] that when the impulses there are act
[26:51] upon he says I don't want my hops to
[26:54] constantly change their name oh if
[26:57] something if this will just happen if
[26:59] this could happen all will be well oh if
[27:00] this could happen oh my hope is built on
[27:02] this my hope is built on that my hope is
[27:04] built on that oh that my hopes would
[27:06] stop changing their name that my hope
[27:09] could be built in nothing less than
[27:11] Jesus blood and
[27:13] righteousness a long for repose that is
[27:16] that ever is the
[27:19] same these chance desires are described
[27:22] so well and so beautifully the childish
[27:26] things what I'm expressing in this is
[27:28] that this one thing desired is a mark of
[27:32] maturity that when David says one thing
[27:34] have I desired that will I seek after
[27:37] life should be the process of
[27:39] determining True Value and as we truly
[27:41] understand value it should cause a
[27:43] narrowing of things
[27:45] desired in 1 Peter chapter 2: 2 as
[27:48] newborn babes and I find this to be
[27:50] instructive because we're not completely
[27:53] like newborn babes in the sense that an
[27:56] infant a newborn is born and it's help
[27:58] listen and I think maybe we could take
[28:01] that type to an extreme there's a lot of
[28:02] beautiful things we could take out of it
[28:04] but now he saying as newborn babes
[28:06] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[28:08] you may grow thereby so there must be
[28:11] some acknowledgement that even though we
[28:13] may be infants in Christ there's an
[28:16] understanding that we could have of
[28:17] what's of value and what is nutritious
[28:20] and what will actually help me to grow
[28:22] so he says desire the sincere milk of
[28:25] the word and I can say that if you
[28:26] desire it you will seek after it one of
[28:29] the marks of a genuine experience is
[28:31] when someone has a hunger an Awakening
[28:33] hunger for the word of God it's past the
[28:36] pretense and the politics and all the
[28:37] popularity and all the religiosity that
[28:40] goes along with it when you really
[28:41] desire the word and you're just as happy
[28:43] to feed the on the message on a Tuesday
[28:45] morning as you are to run and dance and
[28:46] Shout on a Saturday night that's a real
[28:48] Mark of an experience when you can have
[28:51] and cultivate a desire for the word of
[28:53] God Amen and it's by that word that we
[28:56] grow that's right so there's a lack of
[28:59] maturity and there's a clinging on of
[29:02] childish things there's only one way
[29:03] that you can become a man and man enough
[29:05] to lay aside those things it's by the
[29:07] word amen so there must be as he
[29:10] acknowledg as newborn babes there's some
[29:12] sort of still chance desire there's
[29:14] still this newness and and this growing
[29:16] and this learning there's still time for
[29:18] me to grow and to learn to determine
[29:20] True Value but the proper aim despite
[29:23] these youthful compulsions within is the
[29:26] milk of the
[29:28] word brother brandham says in the sermon
[29:30] God hiding himself in Simplicity then
[29:32] revealing himself in the same many times
[29:35] teenage children and sometimes adults
[29:37] will get to you know young people will
[29:40] pass notes or cut up or something in
[29:43] church read R's Waldo
[29:46] books but is kind of acknowledging this
[29:48] is at the very outset of this sermon so
[29:50] it wasn't necessar his big climactic
[29:53] Revelation when he's preaching God
[29:54] hiding himself in Simplicity but just in
[29:56] this dedication of the the remodeling
[29:59] things he say you know sometimes teenage
[30:00] children adults even will do things in
[30:03] church he says now you're old enough to
[30:05] know better than that you should know
[30:08] better than that so our teenage children
[30:11] and our adults should know better than
[30:13] that he says if you expect to be a real
[30:16] man someday and raise a family to the
[30:18] kingdom of God then start it off started
[30:21] off in the beginning and act right and
[30:23] do
[30:24] right and it's expressing this a that
[30:27] even as teenagers and young people there
[30:30] ought to be some level of awareness to
[30:32] where there's a certain Behavior that's
[30:34] expected of me that's becoming of me and
[30:36] then if I don't act according to that
[30:38] I'm not progressing the right way you
[30:41] should be old enough if you want to be a
[30:43] man someday and raise a family then
[30:45] you've got to get it right in the
[30:47] beginning and you have to be Desiring
[30:49] the sincere milk of the word of God that
[30:52] you may grow thereby so that you're not
[30:53] a Manchild when you enter into marriage
[30:56] amen
[30:58] desire the sincere milk of the
[31:00] word this is a that you may grow my
[31:05] understanding grows my experience grows
[31:06] my ability to determine value
[31:10] grows in Philippians chapter 3: 7 and 8
[31:13] Paul makes a declaration that is quite
[31:16] outstanding but what things were gained
[31:17] to me how did he gain it through life
[31:20] through education through experience he
[31:22] says those I counted loss for Christ the
[31:26] things of my youth and my uh my
[31:28] dedication and all the education and
[31:30] through my discipline I count it as lost
[31:32] for Christ y doubtless I count all
[31:33] things but lost for the exellency of the
[31:35] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord I will
[31:39] then count everything else uh
[31:43] inferior and I that I would count them
[31:45] all for uh but loss that I might gain
[31:48] the Excellency of the knowledge of
[31:49] Christ Jesus my Lord one thing desired
[31:52] above all else for whom I've suffered
[31:54] the loss of all things and do count them
[31:56] all things things but dong that I may
[31:58] win Christ in other words I count all
[32:00] things but dong but I count Christ to be
[32:03] the most important thing now it's one
[32:05] thing desired among the many that were
[32:07] gained what has happened to Paul through
[32:09] his experience there were many things
[32:11] that were gained and now it's all been
[32:13] narrowed in his maturity one thing
[32:16] desired through his suffering through
[32:18] his experience through the revelation of
[32:20] Jesus Christ the many things that were
[32:21] gained the many things that he enjoyed
[32:23] he even goes to announce and express all
[32:25] these different things that were accul
[32:27] he says now I've been able to narrow it
[32:29] all
[32:29] down to one thing
[32:33] desired there's times we need to maybe
[32:35] resist the impulse to give our spiritual
[32:37] resume to impress
[32:42] people and just leave it and let it rest
[32:45] in the fact that you know you desire one
[32:47] thing and you're seeking after
[32:50] it Jesus says in Matthew 6: 19-
[32:55] 24 this is the Prelude to take no
[32:57] thought to what you shall eat drink and
[32:59] be clothed and Gentiles seek after it
[33:01] and because they seek after it it's
[33:02] indicative of what's really in their
[33:03] heart what they value so he says seek ye
[33:05] first the kingdom of God and this
[33:08] narrowing to one thing
[33:09] desired he says lay that up for
[33:11] yourselves I want to read verses 19 to
[33:13] 24 I provided this so you know you that
[33:16] take notes know that I'm going to be
[33:18] going on to verse 24 but we'll inject
[33:20] some things in here we'll take verse 19
[33:22] and 20 and then insert some other
[33:24] readings here it says lay not up for
[33:26] yourself Treasures upon
[33:29] Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt
[33:32] and where thieves break through and
[33:35] still these Earthly Treasures to say
[33:38] this Earthly Treasures to say treasure
[33:40] it speaks of a storehouse so it's a
[33:41] storage of what one would consider good
[33:44] and precious things and to say the
[33:47] laying up of treasures upon Earth it's
[33:49] actually kind of this hoarding of things
[33:52] add to where that this I'm going to
[33:53] collect and and consume valuables and I
[33:56] want to gain them and and store them and
[33:59] then his use of language to express this
[34:02] moth and rust and thieves helps break
[34:05] down to give us an understanding of the
[34:07] things he's talking about so he says lay
[34:09] not up Treasures for yourself that moths
[34:12] can corrupt and he's speaking of
[34:14] clothing because moth corrupt the
[34:16] garments and the clothing that we wear
[34:18] and he says and rust doth corrupt he's
[34:20] not speaking of the type of rust that
[34:21] would corrupt Metals but rather the kind
[34:23] of uh rotting of vegetables and food
[34:27] it's the language that's used there and
[34:28] then thieves could break through and
[34:31] steal so he's been able to take the very
[34:33] things from Matthew 6:31 what shall we
[34:35] eat what we shall drink and how will be
[34:37] clothed and he takes that in the the the
[34:40] moth and the rust but now he says and
[34:42] thieves that would be the gold and the
[34:44] jewelry the things of metals and things
[34:47] of certain uh stone that we consider
[34:49] precious and we hide and time won't rot
[34:52] them time won't waste them away but
[34:54] thieves can steal
[34:55] it so what are they they're not only
[34:57] things that perish become unstable but
[35:00] they're things that are always changing
[35:01] or can be taken
[35:02] away these are things that are not
[35:05] constant these are things that are not
[35:07] sure it's this it's this transient
[35:10] nature of
[35:11] Desire lay not up for yourselves
[35:13] Treasures upon Earth and he says that
[35:16] the moth will corrupt it the rust will
[35:18] corrupt it thieves will steal it right
[35:21] words these things that we pursue uh
[35:23] they
[35:24] change and when you really want uh
[35:27] really crave for a good garment this is
[35:28] one of those things I'm sorry honey I
[35:30] just feel like I need to share it I
[35:32] never realized just how many purses a
[35:33] woman needed until I got married I was
[35:36] like man this is a good purse we'll buy
[35:37] this for life right and I like you buy
[35:40] it for life right you have one
[35:41] wallet and you use it all the days of
[35:44] your life until the very end and it's in
[35:45] some ways it's a time time capsule of
[35:47] your life right you got every driver's
[35:49] license in it you got all the gift cards
[35:51] everything it's right there it's a
[35:52] beautiful time capsule you can tell
[35:53] everything you've eaten and done for the
[35:55] last 50 years in your one wall it but
[35:57] but a woman she she's got one purse for
[36:00] one season then after a while it's like
[36:02] you know what I don't like that purse
[36:04] anymore the leather's still good the
[36:05] strap still intact but it's just the
[36:07] nature of desire right there no sin
[36:10] nothing wrong with it at all I still buy
[36:12] bags and purses she know she maybe she
[36:15] likes bags I Like to Buy electronics and
[36:17] cables and Chargers you know and so
[36:19] there's certain things though that's
[36:20] transient right changing is what I mean
[36:24] and and it's expression of how that
[36:26] there's as you desire garments garments
[36:28] change they they they they tear moths
[36:31] will eat it food oh food it gets
[36:33] corrupted it gets H it rots it's
[36:36] destroyed thieves will come and take and
[36:38] steal value can be
[36:41] lost and brother brandham in the sermon
[36:43] handwriting on the wall says as the
[36:45] Gentile age was issued in under rotness
[36:49] and drinking and women and carousing the
[36:52] Gentile dispensation is going out in the
[36:54] same manner that's right we're going out
[36:56] to chaos from drinking drunken and I'm
[36:59] using this to be very precise about
[37:02] desire and the intoxication of chance
[37:05] desires and being under the intoxication
[37:07] of the impulse of consumption and the
[37:10] way that it works upon the Flesh and the
[37:11] things we value and we value what we eat
[37:14] we value what we drink and we value what
[37:16] we put on and we value the things we
[37:19] possess and we're if we're not careful
[37:21] we think that it's some marker of
[37:22] attainment and even God's blessing when
[37:25] we ought not to fool ourselves into
[37:27] thinking that because we can eat good
[37:29] things and buy good things and possess
[37:31] good things that God is blessing us let
[37:34] us be weighed by one thing what do I
[37:38] [Music]
[37:40] desire and I use this as just to showing
[37:43] the message of the hour we speaking to
[37:45] these things says our little teenage
[37:47] children out here in school this is the
[37:49] that lack of this immaturity they start
[37:52] them off with smoking cigarettes and
[37:55] they go from there to marijuana
[37:58] right you thought just a gateway drug or
[37:59] a Gateway thing was just a modern
[38:01] parament but brother BR saying this is
[38:03] where it
[38:04] starts right and now now where do we
[38:07] start we start maybe with the marijuana
[38:09] right we've been educated enough to know
[38:11] that cigarettes are bad and so now and I
[38:13] want you right it's the things that feed
[38:15] the flesh it's the thing that we put
[38:17] value on it's the very thing that we're
[38:21] pursuing I I maybe I'm not sure if this
[38:24] is where it'll fit I just feel kind of
[38:25] impressed Maybe to reach into the future
[38:28] now and bring this
[38:30] in there is a and I hope that God gives
[38:33] me the grace to be able to express this
[38:36] notice how he says you start out by
[38:37] smoking cigarettes and then it leads to
[38:39] something that would be even worse and I
[38:42] believe that he's he's he's showing it
[38:44] some sort of graduation or uh uh
[38:47] deterioration of desire to where there
[38:50] worse and worse and we start out with
[38:53] one thing I can control this but then it
[38:54] gets worse and worse we become more
[38:55] addicted now
[38:57] this this Paradigm works and this this
[39:00] pattern Works in other things by what
[39:03] you desire now someone who's smoking
[39:06] what would you say their desire is when
[39:08] they begin doing that they begin
[39:10] ingesting certain things and begin
[39:11] pursuing certain things and it begins to
[39:13] lead to the worst thing and so this is
[39:15] where I want to reach into the future if
[39:17] your
[39:18] desire is to be well in your body that's
[39:22] that's a good desire but when you make
[39:25] that your Pursuit
[39:27] believe it or not that could make your
[39:29] health worse because you should know
[39:32] better to seek the Healer not just your
[39:35] healing you should one thing desired not
[39:38] that I'm Healed but the Healer not not
[39:41] that I have a healthy body but that
[39:43] Christ is alive in me and you'll find
[39:46] the more that you pursue your healing
[39:48] the worse your sickness will get because
[39:50] you veered from the one
[39:52] thing the more you drill in the more you
[39:55] dig the worse your symptoms get the more
[39:57] aha moments you have is this is what I
[39:58] have this is what I have cuz I'm going
[40:00] to find this vitamin that'll work I'll
[40:01] find this that'll work I'll find this
[40:03] that'll work and the more you feed on
[40:05] that the more sick you get when I
[40:07] believe if God could help us to have one
[40:09] thing desired that's where our health
[40:11] will come
[40:13] from I back out of all my Pursuits I
[40:16] back out of all these programs and
[40:18] protocols and come back to one thing one
[40:20] thing have I desired of the Lord that
[40:22] will I seek after and Lord lead me and
[40:24] guide me and whatever else may through
[40:26] my which my healing will come but may I
[40:27] not lose sight of one thing
[40:29] desired cuz it just gets
[40:32] worse there's a laying up of Earthly
[40:35] Treasures the hoarding of things that
[40:37] are valuable in the flesh but he does
[40:39] not end there of just castigating us for
[40:41] our Earthly Treasures he says but hoard
[40:43] and lay up for yourselves Treasures in
[40:45] Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth
[40:48] corrupt where thieves do not break
[40:50] through nor steal it's the opposite of
[40:53] those things that are merely Earthly
[40:55] things are treasured of Earth they can
[40:57] be
[40:58] destroyed the those who have engaged in
[41:01] the investment things you find that no
[41:03] matter how valuable something may
[41:06] be that just in a matter of time
[41:08] perceptions can change right everybody
[41:11] who has a storage unit full of Beanie
[41:14] Babies right it's not even worth the
[41:17] money you're paying month to month for
[41:18] the storage unit all billion of them why
[41:21] because V things
[41:23] change and through the process of time
[41:26] these things that we think are so
[41:27] wonderful and so great you could have
[41:30] something believe it or not you could
[41:31] have something that's worth a billion
[41:33] dollars but you couldn't you couldn't
[41:34] get half that out of it maybe not even a
[41:38] tenth out of it why because the you're a
[41:40] market of
[41:41] one nobody else wants it yeah sure
[41:44] that's worth a billion dollars oh my
[41:45] goodness it's worth a billion dollars
[41:47] put it up on eBay you won't get one
[41:50] bid well as long as there's an Elon
[41:52] maybe you
[41:53] will but there's a there's there's a
[41:56] recognition these things are the
[41:58] opposite of things that are merely
[42:01] Earthly Jesus says it this way in Luke
[42:03] 12 verse 33 speaking of the same thing
[42:06] sell that you have and give
[42:09] arms now could I could I just take a
[42:11] survey are you following me to this
[42:14] point because now it
[42:17] escalates sell that you have and give
[42:20] arms provide yourselves bags which wax
[42:23] not old a treasure in the heavens that
[42:26] fath not where no Thief approacheth nor
[42:29] moth corruptive man just such beautiful
[42:32] poetry this is a challenging challenging
[42:35] Paradigm Shift of
[42:37] values this is saying that you sell what
[42:39] you have and give arms get get get some
[42:42] value and worth out of it get some
[42:43] currency out of it sell the things that
[42:45] are important to you and then take the
[42:47] money you've got from it and give it as
[42:49] a way of providing for others who have
[42:51] need of provide yourselves bags which
[42:53] wax not old if I could put it this way
[42:55] one thing you should desire and seek
[42:58] after it one thing desired and I'm going
[43:01] to put my actions where my desire is I'm
[43:03] going to put my where my words are I'm
[43:06] going to put my actions to
[43:08] it and this is what Jesus is speaking to
[43:10] in Luke 12: 13 to 21 and one of the
[43:14] company said unto him Master speak to my
[43:16] brother that he divide the inheritance
[43:18] with me Jesus's answer is pretty
[43:20] remarkable and he said to himman who
[43:23] made me a judge or divider over you
[43:26] who made me your judge who why who am I
[43:28] to div divy up your your property to you
[43:31] and he said unto them take heed and
[43:33] beware of
[43:34] covetousness for a man's life consisteth
[43:37] not in the abundance of things which he
[43:40] possesseth the
[43:42] things and he spake a parable unto them
[43:45] saying the ground of a certain rich man
[43:47] brought forth
[43:48] plentifully and he thought with him
[43:51] himself saying what shall I do because I
[43:53] have no room where to bestow my fruits
[43:55] now when he says says bestow he doesn't
[43:57] mean give it away I my Harvest is so big
[44:00] I don't have enough square footage in my
[44:02] warehouse to store my Harvest so his
[44:06] response isn't fill up the Garners and
[44:09] give the rest away he says this will I
[44:12] do in verse 18 I will pull down my Barns
[44:15] and build greater and there will I
[44:18] bestow all my fruits and my goods and I
[44:21] will say to my soul soul you know he's
[44:24] crazy now right when he's talking to
[44:27] himself
[44:28] Soul thou Hast much Goods laid up for
[44:31] many years take thine ease eat drink and
[44:33] be Mary and now God rebukes him in his
[44:36] grace he rebukes him and I know this is
[44:38] a parable he says but God said him thou
[44:40] fool this night thy Soul shall be
[44:43] required of thee Soul right then whose
[44:47] shall those things be which thou Hast
[44:50] provided you can even go back to look at
[44:52] how this one asked about dividing the
[44:55] inheritance with me he says it in answer
[44:58] to the argument over an inheritance even
[45:01] those things that you think might be
[45:04] distributed there can always be one that
[45:07] intervenes and the one oh I want this to
[45:09] all go to so and so and I've stored all
[45:11] this up so it can go to so and so it
[45:12] doesn't always work out that way even as
[45:15] of late I've helped try to help people
[45:17] navigate situations where they've left
[45:18] in their will I want all my money to go
[45:21] to brother so and so for the furtherance
[45:23] of the word of God and now brother so
[45:24] and so sister so- and so and you're
[45:26] thinking well I don't think I want my
[45:27] money to go to
[45:29] that I know I got everybody thinking
[45:31] now a little Hyperbole and exaggeration
[45:34] there but he says so is he that layeth
[45:39] up treasure for himself and is not rich
[45:43] toward
[45:44] God this man's Paradigm was well I want
[45:47] to get get get get get until I don't
[45:49] have enough room and then make more room
[45:53] I'm even going to be wasteful I'm going
[45:54] to take a perfectly good barn and tear
[45:56] it down to build a bigger one so I can
[45:57] put more valuables and goods in it and
[46:00] say to myself myself self Soul you got
[46:03] enough for the rest of your life take
[46:05] ease but Jesus says sell what you have
[46:09] now this is what he comes to Luke 1233
[46:11] sell what you have and give
[46:13] arms and know words give that which is
[46:15] beyond what you need for your own
[46:18] support be diligent enough to know what
[46:20] you need and as there be excess don't
[46:22] use the excess for self-c consumption
[46:25] but think of that you can use it to
[46:27] further one thing
[46:28] desired if what you desire is to to
[46:31] further your own enrichment and to
[46:32] further your kingdom and to do all these
[46:34] things for yourself then sure there's
[46:36] many things you might try to pursue but
[46:38] when you've been able to simplify your
[46:40] life when you're able to live long
[46:42] enough to understand True Value and you
[46:44] can simplify your life to the narrow
[46:46] down to one thing desired then it even
[46:48] gives perspective to the abundance of
[46:50] things that we have in the
[46:52] flesh Proverbs 19:17 says he that hath
[46:55] pity upon the the poor lendeth unto the
[46:58] Lord that's what he means when he says
[47:00] so is he that layeth up treasure for
[47:02] himself and is not rich toward
[47:06] God it's just so
[47:08] beautiful what does it speak to what one
[47:10] thing desires what they seek after what
[47:14] they what they value is what you put
[47:15] your money in it shows what we think
[47:18] about it when we when we spend the money
[47:20] on it we seek after its uh its
[47:24] betterment we we're circling back to
[47:26] even some things we used at the very
[47:28] beginning of the year last year just a
[47:30] couple scriptures I thought it was just
[47:32] remarkable how the Lord Works to where I
[47:34] feel in my heart that it's not just me
[47:36] reverting back to things I've preached
[47:37] before but it's the Holy Spirit knowing
[47:40] the rhythm of our lives and Discerning
[47:42] the needs in our hearts and I thank God
[47:44] he's able to revisit
[47:47] them says in Hagi 3 and4 then came the
[47:50] word of the Lord by haggi the prophet
[47:51] saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell
[47:54] in your sealed houses
[47:56] in this house lie waste and what's the
[47:59] what's the image that's brought up
[48:00] before them they lived in houses with
[48:03] Wes coating bead board and crown molding
[48:07] beautifully sealed houses ornamented
[48:10] adorned luxury am miniz all to the to
[48:13] the tea and beautiful permanent
[48:15] dwellings in the house of the Lord laid
[48:18] in
[48:19] waste he says is this what it's time for
[48:21] for you just to continue to accumulate
[48:23] wealth and get better and better and
[48:24] better and then the house the Lord
[48:26] laying waste is this the season is this
[48:28] what it's all about and it was a
[48:30] challenge to what they prioritized it
[48:32] was a challenge to what they Ved as a
[48:33] challenge to what they had been asked to
[48:35] do in the beginning that they ought to
[48:36] give care that they give so that the
[48:38] house of the Lord never lay in waste God
[48:41] gave a great program that they might
[48:42] have sealed houses he's not preaching
[48:44] against sealed houses it's not a sin to
[48:46] have sealed houses don't go home and rip
[48:48] out your beadboard and tear up your nice
[48:49] hardwood floors there's no sin in that
[48:51] but he's saying why give everything to
[48:53] that and then you're not rich to toward
[48:56] God the Bible says he that lendeth has
[49:00] pity upon the poor he that gives where
[49:02] the needs are is lending unto the Lord
[49:05] and that which he hath given will he pay
[49:07] him again in other words what you've
[49:09] given to the Lord and lended to the Lord
[49:11] the Lord pays back did you re did you
[49:13] hear what the scripture says when you
[49:15] have pity upon the poor when you
[49:16] recognize the needy when you're given to
[49:18] where the needs are and you're giving to
[49:20] it you're lending you're lending to the
[49:22] Lord and the Lord's not going to be
[49:23] indebted to anyone oh my goodness you
[49:25] talk about a program you talk about an
[49:28] investment you do what God's asked us to
[49:31] do we know the will of God for us this
[49:32] year you can't out give God when you
[49:34] give your lending to the Lord that's why
[49:36] he'll repay
[49:39] yes he'll give what you he'll pay you
[49:41] again what you've
[49:43] given he says let us give alms provide
[49:47] yourselves bags which wax not old now
[49:51] that could be a scriptural uh
[49:52] justification for buying purses just
[49:55] throw that out there I feel checked the
[49:58] word corrects the airor your bags are
[50:01] waxing old honey let me buy you a new
[50:03] one and so the bags which wax not old it
[50:08] speaks I even found that it meant more
[50:09] to me studying it this time than ever
[50:11] before that there's that it's money
[50:14] that's hoarded up in bags just as the
[50:16] man here has a great harvest and he's
[50:19] going to he has Barn like the barns he'
[50:21] thought through this before this will be
[50:23] enough so if he could fill it up he's
[50:25] taking taken care of keep doing what
[50:27] you're doing take the excess give give
[50:29] what you ought to give and give
[50:30] abundantly cuz you're lending to God
[50:32] God's going to pay you back don't live
[50:34] in fear don't hoard up and so the bags
[50:36] which watch not old it speaks of taking
[50:38] valuables and goods and you're just
[50:39] hoarding them and then you keep it for
[50:41] so long the bag begins to rot
[50:44] through and you're putting your money in
[50:46] bags that are so old that they're worn
[50:48] out that's what he says in Hagi again
[50:51] you've swn much and bring in little you
[50:53] eat but you have not enough why because
[50:55] your more worried about your own things
[50:57] and not the one thing that should be
[50:58] desired ye drink but you're not filled
[51:00] with
[51:01] drink you clothe you and there's none
[51:04] warm notice the Symmetry to the very
[51:07] things that Jesus says that this is what
[51:09] the Gentiles seek after the very things
[51:11] that your heavenly father knows that you
[51:13] have need of and it's the very things
[51:15] that the more we try to get it the less
[51:17] it really satisfies and the less it
[51:19] really produces its
[51:21] value and he that
[51:24] earnthenecklace to a bag with
[51:27] holes it meant more to me this time in
[51:29] Reading in conjunction with Luke 12 to
[51:31] realize not only is it speak of our
[51:33] wasteful spending but we're just keep
[51:35] putting it into something and we're
[51:36] never using it we're just saving it up
[51:39] for the we're saving it up we're saving
[51:41] it up we're saving it up and you're not
[51:43] even prudent in it you're not even you
[51:46] don't even know what it will bring you
[51:47] because it's just beginning to rot and
[51:49] now the very bag you put it in you've
[51:51] been shoving away money for so long and
[51:53] I'm just using that as an analogy of
[51:54] value
[51:56] that you're getting nothing out of it
[51:58] and you've forgotten the one thing
[52:01] desired Happy New Year to
[52:05] you the scripture I've been studying is
[52:08] here in verse 21
[52:10] now Matthew chapter 6:
[52:13] 21 as he says lay up not uh Earthly
[52:16] Treasures that moth and rust corrupt and
[52:18] thieves can steal but lay up yourselves
[52:20] Treasures in
[52:21] Heaven a treasure in heaven that faileth
[52:24] not where no Thief approach neither moth
[52:26] corruptive for where your treasure is
[52:29] you are you still with me tonight where
[52:32] your treasure is there will your heart
[52:34] be
[52:35] also you know words your heart's going
[52:37] to follow those things that you
[52:41] value maybe it's what comes first I
[52:43] don't I don't I'm not sure which one
[52:44] comes first but it just speaks to the
[52:46] fact that if you value something you'll
[52:48] pursue it whatever you make your
[52:51] treasure gains possession of your heart
[52:56] are we listening whatever becomes your
[53:00] treasure be it becomes the owner and the
[53:04] possessor of your heart in other words
[53:05] it takes control this is why Jesus says
[53:07] in verse 24 as we skip to that no man
[53:09] can serve two masters for either he will
[53:11] hate the one and love the other or else
[53:13] he'll hold to the one and despise the
[53:15] other you cannot serve God and Mammon
[53:20] the worldly things if you serve it it
[53:22] takes control of your
[53:23] heart if becomes your treasure it gains
[53:26] possession of your heart you cannot have
[53:28] both possess in your heart this is what
[53:31] leads John to say if you love the things
[53:32] of the world the love of the father is
[53:33] not in you doesn't necessarily even mean
[53:36] God's love is not in you but rather how
[53:38] can you profess for the Lord to be your
[53:40] treasure when he does not have
[53:42] possession of your
[53:45] heart Colossians 3 veres 1 and 2 if you
[53:48] then been R be risen with Christ seek
[53:51] those things which are above where
[53:53] Christ sth on the right hand of of God
[53:56] set your affection on things above not
[54:00] on things on the earth I'll come back to
[54:03] where your treasure is there will your
[54:05] heart be also maybe we'll amplify that a
[54:07] little bit more at a later time but here
[54:10] Paul's putting in this way direct your
[54:11] heart to Christ seek for him strive for
[54:14] him be purposed in your heart make
[54:17] Christ your
[54:19] treasure desire the sincere milk of the
[54:22] word make a deliberate decision
[54:25] Christ I want to put you first one thing
[54:29] desired Above All Else the word one
[54:31] thing desired Above All Else Christ and
[54:34] it will be determined by what I seek
[54:37] after set your affections on things
[54:39] above set your aim on Christ above not
[54:42] on the things of this Earth do you
[54:44] recognize how it has been Singularity
[54:47] and multiplicity that there's this
[54:49] narrowing down when you look to Heaven
[54:51] it's not so much Heavenly things though
[54:53] we might think on these things these
[54:55] things speak of the one thing
[54:57] Christ whereas the Earthly things my not
[55:00] even a dichotomy but just the
[55:03] multiplicity of so many
[55:06] things this is I wanted to use these
[55:09] things in the sermon on step by step
[55:12] about our singular aim and brother
[55:15] bradam in the sermon thinking on our way
[55:17] is talking about a a bum he met I just
[55:20] called him a a floater he said he wasn't
[55:23] a drug user he wasn't a bad guy but he
[55:25] was a bum I think he said he wasn't a
[55:27] drinker drunk and he took him to
[55:31] lunch and brother brandham said where
[55:33] did you start this about 20 years ago
[55:36] where are you going
[55:38] nowhere where did you come from
[55:42] nowhere how long do you expect to keep
[55:44] this up oh I don't know he says no
[55:48] Ambitions no
[55:50] aim there there's no
[55:52] objective and I would say
[55:55] this is just as bad as having a bunch of
[55:58] them exactly this is just as bad as not
[56:02] having one thing and having
[56:05] many why the Christian ought to be the
[56:08] most ambitious person in the
[56:11] world we shouldn't lose our Ambitions
[56:14] one thing desired should not just make
[56:16] us
[56:17] vegetables and we have no ambition bring
[56:21] this glorious Gospel of eternal life to
[56:22] a dying and perishing world we should be
[56:25] up and at
[56:26] it if we truly desire one thing above
[56:29] all others then our actions will dictate
[56:32] it a brother was sharing with me that he
[56:35] that he wanted to be addicted to the
[56:36] word right we're fellowshipping on that
[56:40] an addict is known by his actions
[56:45] right hey hey you know they see a garage
[56:48] door open right and sneak in see that
[56:51] you find a weed eater weed whacker weed
[56:53] whipper whatever you call it you find
[56:54] find out where you're from by what you
[56:55] call it right I guess we don't have
[56:57] those here they're going to find a r a
[56:58] rock raker they're going to steal
[57:00] something right because they they're
[57:02] driven to do it there's something that
[57:05] gives this impulse and this unction you
[57:06] know them by their actions and this is
[57:09] what we should look at say am I
[57:11] ambitious for the things of
[57:14] God we should be up and at it the sermon
[57:17] as the eagle stirs her nest that's the
[57:20] way God builds his church for his
[57:21] eaglets high above the Ambitions of this
[57:24] world so when we are to be ambitious
[57:27] it's not that we have a lot of Ambitions
[57:29] he says she's got high ambition oh I
[57:33] love how he singularized it again oh
[57:35] there's Ambitions of the world but
[57:37] there's just one Heavenly ambition Let
[57:40] It Be Christ that's
[57:42] right why Christians ought to be the
[57:45] most ambitious person in the world I
[57:46] want to do this I want to do that I want
[57:47] to do that no no no no one thing
[57:50] desired high above the Ambitions of this
[57:52] world she's got high ambition
[57:56] not to please men but to please God
[57:59] she's built high and
[58:02] safe because her ambition is in
[58:05] Christ I'm trying to hurry here verse 22
[58:09] for verse 21 for where your treasur is
[58:11] there will your heart be also now think
[58:13] of that in terms of this driving force
[58:17] whatever is your treasure gains
[58:19] possession of your
[58:20] heart now that may open up a lot of
[58:22] questions for you in terms of how do
[58:24] make something my treasure how do
[58:27] I make seek Heavenly treasures and those
[58:31] are good questions I would hope that
[58:34] maybe that's what my preaching does is
[58:35] it prompts you to ask questions and you
[58:38] you're so desirous of an answer you go
[58:39] to the word and you go to God to get it
[58:42] and we don't need to print a church
[58:43] manual so you're going say well you know
[58:45] let's see I almost grabbed the Bible and
[58:46] said well that's that'd be accurate but
[58:48] you're like well we've we've turned in
[58:49] the Arizona Believers Church manual it
[58:52] says right here that whenever you're h
[58:55] and you you just go to my blog right and
[58:57] I'll tell you everything you need to do
[58:59] in the new year to get it right I just
[59:01] want to provoke the questions righten
[59:04] these are a lot of things we need to
[59:05] take inventory in our lives and think
[59:06] about one thing desired I'm giving you
[59:09] enough scripture here for you to really
[59:11] start to chew on and realize there's
[59:12] some weight and emphasis in these things
[59:14] to challenge us about our
[59:17] values David said one thing I've
[59:20] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[59:22] after that I may dwell in the house of
[59:24] the Lord Lord all the days of my life
[59:26] yes amen Jesus continuing for your
[59:28] treasure is there will your heart be
[59:30] also says in verse 22 the light of the
[59:32] body is the eye I saw I I know I'm going
[59:35] long tonight the light of the body is
[59:37] the eye if therefore thine eye be single
[59:40] thy whole body shall be full of light
[59:43] I'll come back to that but if thine eye
[59:45] be evil thy whole body shall be full of
[59:47] Darkness if therefore the light that is
[59:49] in the be Darkness how great is that
[59:52] Darkness now there's a lot said here
[59:55] and what's amazing is he's talking about
[59:56] treasure he's talking about Pursuit he's
[59:58] talking about what one would value
[59:59] laying up Treasures in Heaven not
[1:00:01] Treasures upon Earth giving arms
[1:00:03] providing yourselves bags with which wax
[1:00:05] not old this is something uh that's all
[1:00:08] in this view when he says the light of
[1:00:09] the body is the eye and if your eye is
[1:00:12] evil the body is going to be full of
[1:00:13] darkness and if you
[1:00:15] think that your eye has light that's the
[1:00:18] worst
[1:00:19] darkness and an evil eye is an eye the
[1:00:21] scriptures being an eye that's chaotic
[1:00:24] or disordered it's an eye that's not set
[1:00:27] on the right the single right
[1:00:30] objective this is what's meant in this
[1:00:32] picture that he's he's painting where
[1:00:35] your treasure where your treasure is
[1:00:37] there will your heart be also and
[1:00:39] there's this dividing between God and
[1:00:41] Mammon God singular Mammon worldly
[1:00:43] things just a cacophony of desires
[1:00:46] chance
[1:00:47] desires all these things that would be
[1:00:49] just a a a Pandora's box of
[1:00:53] impulse but yet God
[1:00:57] Christ this evil eye is an eye that's
[1:00:59] not set on a single correct correct
[1:01:02] objective Proverbs 23: 5 and 6 wil thou
[1:01:05] set thine eyes upon that which is not
[1:01:08] now this is amazing when I was reading
[1:01:09] this this week well you set your eyes
[1:01:11] upon that which is not in other words
[1:01:13] you're going to set your gaze upon it
[1:01:15] your direction your aim for riches
[1:01:17] certainly make themselves Wings they fly
[1:01:20] away as an eagle toward heaven and we're
[1:01:22] like bless God riches are like eagles
[1:01:25] God Likens his children to
[1:01:28] Eagles and
[1:01:30] well
[1:01:32] okay it's not what he
[1:01:34] means but he's saying that these riches
[1:01:37] that you've got your eyes on they'll
[1:01:39] just fly away so why set your eyes on
[1:01:41] things that aren't they're not they're
[1:01:43] not guaranteed they're not permanent he
[1:01:45] says eat thou not the bread of him that
[1:01:47] hath an evil eye neither desire thou his
[1:01:50] dainty
[1:01:52] Meats his dainty Meats
[1:01:55] it should be a cover band with the L
[1:01:57] fellas of A baser
[1:02:00] Sort there it hearkens back to verse
[1:02:03] five of how an evil eye setting your eye
[1:02:06] on that which is not one who has put all
[1:02:08] of his hope in The Riches of this
[1:02:11] Earth it's this chaotic evil
[1:02:14] eye and and we can only really
[1:02:17] understand it with the contrast of the
[1:02:19] eye if it's single a single eye is an
[1:02:21] eye that is simple and clear it's an eye
[1:02:25] that's not looking two ways right your
[1:02:28] eyesight is not divided it's simple it's
[1:02:32] singular it's to
[1:02:35] Christ let thine eyes look right on it
[1:02:39] says in Proverbs 4:25 to 27 let thine
[1:02:42] eyes look right on and let thine eyelids
[1:02:44] look straight before thee Ponder this is
[1:02:47] where I'm asking you the question Ponder
[1:02:48] the feet of thy path and let all thy
[1:02:50] ways be established turn not to the
[1:02:52] right hand nor to the left remove thy
[1:02:54] foot from Evil yes I'm going to wrap
[1:02:58] this up this heavy thought tonight this
[1:03:00] challenging thought
[1:03:02] tonight that if thine eye if the light
[1:03:05] of the body the light of the body is the
[1:03:07] ey if there therefore thine eye be
[1:03:10] single if your aim be singular if your
[1:03:14] desires be narrowed down if it's evil
[1:03:16] it's
[1:03:17] divided if it's evil if I could put it
[1:03:19] this way you're just spread
[1:03:21] thin got so many irons in the fire
[1:03:25] you have so many things that are really
[1:03:26] important to you that when it comes time
[1:03:29] to dedicating attention when it comes
[1:03:31] time to being present when it comes time
[1:03:33] to uh clearing your schedule you're not
[1:03:35] able to do it because you look at oh but
[1:03:37] this is important and that's important
[1:03:38] and this is important and you've got
[1:03:40] nothing of greater value to weigh it
[1:03:42] against in order to help you start
[1:03:44] making the decisions to not be spread so
[1:03:47] thin and say at the end of the day
[1:03:49] there's one thing that's
[1:03:51] needful there's one thing at the end of
[1:03:53] the day that I've got to protect above
[1:03:55] everything else and it's the one thing
[1:03:57] desired are you following me tonight is
[1:04:00] it is it is it practical for you is it
[1:04:03] is it plain enough without the details
[1:04:06] that you can be very specific in your
[1:04:08] own life that there's a way that we get
[1:04:09] spread thin with so many irons in the
[1:04:11] fire trying to do so many things that
[1:04:13] we've left the one thing
[1:04:15] undone the one thing that is
[1:04:18] needful the one thing we say we desire
[1:04:22] yes but if I suit be singular I just
[1:04:25] love this the whole body shall be full
[1:04:28] of
[1:04:30] light your strength of character your
[1:04:32] Spiritual Development your spiritual
[1:04:34] maturity is dependent upon this singular
[1:04:38] simple Focus amen that when I can have
[1:04:42] one thing desired my body will be full
[1:04:44] of light my strength of character comes
[1:04:47] from this singular objective my strength
[1:04:49] of character is not in my multitasking
[1:04:53] and not all the things that I can do my
[1:04:55] strength of character in my maturity has
[1:04:57] not been in all the ways that I can
[1:04:59] appear to man but it is because I've
[1:05:01] been able to put away childish things
[1:05:03] and narrow my desire to one the greatest
[1:05:05] Simplicity that I can have in my life is
[1:05:08] to know that my heart is now
[1:05:11] single that it is now to Christ and to
[1:05:14] Christ
[1:05:15] alone because A Heart Divided Between
[1:05:18] Heaven and Earth is entirely
[1:05:21] dark and it's our desire remember this
[1:05:23] it's our desire that determines our
[1:05:27] character is it
[1:05:29] simple is it singular is it to
[1:05:33] Christ he says in Luke 11:36 If thy
[1:05:36] whole body therefore be full of light
[1:05:38] having no part dark the whole shall be
[1:05:42] full of light as when the bright shining
[1:05:46] of a candle doth give thee
[1:05:49] light there's the
[1:05:51] secret there's the secret to growing and
[1:05:53] matur uring there's the secret to being
[1:05:56] able to determine value is when I could
[1:05:58] begin to narrow my desires to One
[1:06:02] Singular purpose there's a lot of uh
[1:06:05] business parlaments we could
[1:06:07] use a lot of lingo we could use
[1:06:09] buzzwords and phrases but there's this
[1:06:12] governing principle that we can have in
[1:06:13] our lives where my life is about this
[1:06:17] one thing
[1:06:19] desired and I weigh everything else in
[1:06:22] light of that
[1:06:24] and there's a place for everything and
[1:06:26] everything in its place and it all has
[1:06:28] to fit with this in the first place and
[1:06:31] if moving one thing out of his place
[1:06:33] causes this to shift I've got something
[1:06:36] wrong somewhere if at any time things
[1:06:39] begin to level there's this phenomena we
[1:06:41] know that uh you're not to fly a state
[1:06:44] flag or any flag higher than the
[1:06:45] American flag so in most places you
[1:06:47] visit the the U the USA flag the uh
[1:06:50] Stars and Stripes is always higher and I
[1:06:52] think you find that in the state capital
[1:06:53] here the flag of Arizona as beautiful as
[1:06:55] it is flies lower than the flag of the
[1:06:58] United States of America but in
[1:07:00] Texas you can't fly it higher but bless
[1:07:03] God we're going to fly them at the same
[1:07:05] height why because of
[1:07:08] pride pride is what it is and they and
[1:07:13] well they won't fly it higher but
[1:07:14] they'll put it on the same level and
[1:07:15] some of you laugh but how many flags are
[1:07:17] flying just as
[1:07:19] high as his
[1:07:21] flag how many flags have you raid in our
[1:07:23] lives raised in our lives whether it be
[1:07:26] entertainment or sports or whatever it
[1:07:28] might be how many flags are flying just
[1:07:30] as high as his flag how many have we
[1:07:33] raised up listen if anything if it ever
[1:07:35] levels something's
[1:07:37] wrong if it ever begins to find the
[1:07:40] stasis where Christ seems to be on the
[1:07:42] same plane as everything else oh God
[1:07:45] help us and Shake Us in this time that
[1:07:47] we're living in now to say one thing
[1:07:49] desired that will I seek
[1:07:52] after God let let it be in my life that
[1:07:55] I can find there's a bright shining of a
[1:07:56] candle that doth give thee
[1:07:59] Light Brothers if you come to your
[1:08:02] instruments in 1st Chronicles chapter
[1:08:05] 29 just reading here in this
[1:08:09] closing 1 Chronicles chapter 9:3
[1:08:14] 29:3 let me just read it to you again in
[1:08:16] Psalms one thing have I desired of the
[1:08:19] Lord that will I seek after that I may D
[1:08:24] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[1:08:25] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:08:29] and to inquire in his
[1:08:31] Temple we could preach a series on just
[1:08:33] each one of those phrases a series of
[1:08:35] many sermons but now I want to read this
[1:08:38] because it's David expressing his desire
[1:08:40] to
[1:08:41] Solomon and David put what we read here
[1:08:44] in Psalms 27:4 I'm reading you this to
[1:08:46] show that David was a man of his
[1:08:49] word in other words the reality of his
[1:08:52] life matched the words of his
[1:08:55] lips moreover because I have set my
[1:08:58] affection to the house of my
[1:09:00] God now as we get more into the series
[1:09:03] on the house of the Lord we'll find that
[1:09:06] it has meaning to us Beyond a temple in
[1:09:10] Jerusalem that do an Israelite the
[1:09:13] Tabernacle and the temple were physical
[1:09:15] structures that they had a physical Duty
[1:09:18] too but I ask you who's the house of God
[1:09:22] today what does it mean to
[1:09:24] you and have I set my affection to the
[1:09:27] dwelling place of his
[1:09:30] presence we got to be Thinking Beyond
[1:09:32] the
[1:09:33] church he says and he says I have of my
[1:09:36] own proper good of gold and silver which
[1:09:38] I have given to the house of my God over
[1:09:41] and above all that I have prepared for
[1:09:43] the Holy
[1:09:44] House David's expression in Psalms 27:4
[1:09:47] was not shallow it was
[1:09:49] real because he put his gold and his
[1:09:52] silver
[1:09:54] where his mouth was if I could put it
[1:09:55] that
[1:09:56] way I've set my affection on the house
[1:09:59] of God and because I have set my
[1:10:01] affection on the things of God because I
[1:10:03] have one thing I've desired I've put my
[1:10:07] thought my words my actions my income
[1:10:12] these things I've put it to it I've
[1:10:15] honored God even he said beyond what
[1:10:17] I've already prepared beyond what was
[1:10:19] necessary I took of my own Storehouse I
[1:10:22] I didn't go on big big build bigger
[1:10:24] barns to hard my wealth I found that
[1:10:26] I've got enough to sustain me let me
[1:10:28] give of my extra to the things of
[1:10:32] God oh I hope that it could just mean
[1:10:34] life to you in whatever way it can mean
[1:10:37] I I I I I I I if I could put it this way
[1:10:41] there's been a substitution I hope I
[1:10:43] don't get myself in trouble with this I
[1:10:45] may never have myself back to preach but
[1:10:47] there's been a substitution of real
[1:10:49] Christian Integrity for Republican
[1:10:50] values and we've subscribed to
[1:10:52] Republican values at the cost and
[1:10:55] expense of being real
[1:11:00] Christians but I've set my affection to
[1:11:02] the house of my
[1:11:05] God in other words if the Lord is truly
[1:11:08] your light and
[1:11:09] salvation do you remember what David
[1:11:11] said he led it he led it up to like the
[1:11:14] he painted a picture if the Lord is
[1:11:17] truly your light and salvation then this
[1:11:19] one thing will be
[1:11:21] desired then the Lord will truly the one
[1:11:24] thing that is
[1:11:25] needful it will be one thing desired the
[1:11:27] highest aim of your
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:33] heart to
[1:11:36] behold the beauty of the
[1:11:39] Lord no one can
[1:11:42] see the true beauty of the
[1:11:45] Lord and have his heart captivated by
[1:11:48] anyone
[1:11:50] else it is only when we forgotten his
[1:11:52] Beauty
[1:11:54] that a heart begins to lean to those
[1:11:57] things that aren't him are you listening
[1:11:59] for just these I'm I'm closing I promise
[1:12:02] I'm closing you cannot see the beauty of
[1:12:06] the Lord and your heart be captured by
[1:12:09] anyone
[1:12:11] else you can't truly see it now this
[1:12:14] might seem a little far-fetched for some
[1:12:16] people who think about all the the the
[1:12:18] light show of
[1:12:20] leoda and all the things that it has to
[1:12:22] offer and then you think of our church
[1:12:25] and you're thinking well look at this
[1:12:27] okay this is our church and you compare
[1:12:30] our church to Dave and Busters or
[1:12:32] ShowBiz Pizza or Chuck-E-Cheese or
[1:12:34] something or Peter Piper whatever it is
[1:12:36] we do in Phoenix I don't know and you
[1:12:38] look at this you're like but this
[1:12:40] doesn't have anything for
[1:12:42] me like that the there's this idea of
[1:12:45] well I'm I'm I'm trying to see something
[1:12:48] here I'm trying to catch something here
[1:12:50] and it doesn't really St but let me just
[1:12:51] say this if you can ever see him
[1:12:54] in his Beauty I know it'll seem crazy to
[1:12:57] the rest of your body but your heart
[1:13:00] will be captivated by his Beauty if we
[1:13:02] can ever see this this is why I say it
[1:13:05] this way so it can become a longing of
[1:13:06] your heart Lord I want to see your
[1:13:07] beauty I want to see your beauty because
[1:13:09] if my heart can see more of your beauty
[1:13:11] then that's Mo less of my heart that can
