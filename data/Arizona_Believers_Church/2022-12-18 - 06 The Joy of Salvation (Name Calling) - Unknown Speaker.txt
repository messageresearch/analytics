TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's a reference to a feast of the booths Feast of Tabernacles it was a time of rejoicing in worship and that's why they were not to be weeping they were not to be sorrowful because it was not the season four were continuous part um six I believe of the joy of our salvation and the title today is name calling and I think that's kind of uh would be a subject that could have a lot of breadth to it a lot of different applications but the subject is name calling and in doing so and looking at this over the last few Services we've been looking at or identifying the right cause for our joy and not just the right cause the things that would make us joyful but also the right object of our joy the things that we joy in the things that we are happy about and we use that quite a bit I think in the sermon cause and effect we were looking at what causes our joy but then actually Joy has an object it's something that we direct it towards and last Sunday this is what we're picking up on mostly is our service last Sunday on tis the season we're living in a specific season of prophetic fulfillment at the right time or right moment when we talk about a season and we need to recognize the time that we're living in the scriptures that God is fulfilling even the promise that he has made that he's to fulfill in this hour if you're looking for God to do something in the season that it's not his time to do it or the time that he has not prophesied it to happen that leads to our disappointment that leads towards shame it leads to sadness but when we know what he's to do in its season and what the right time is then we can trust in him and look to it and so when we look at our season of Joy last week we're looking at how that God will rejoicing in what God is doing presently even as Peter Rhodey desired that they'd be established in the present truth and so we rejoice in what God is doing presently and because of that it's not an irrational exuberance it's not baseless enthusiasm we see what God is doing we recognize it in the moment that we're living in and we have a basis for joy we have a basis for our excitement and there's a number of statements I found myself just collecting in the message of the hour and I started just putting them in my notes and after a while I realized this could just go on in perpetuity so we'll just make reference to it that you can look it up yourself and you can listen for it as you listen to the message of the hour brother bam says a lot about in its season there's certain scriptures he said man shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceeds to have a mouth of God in its season he says that uh the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it in its season there's a lot of scripture that he places with this thought of in its season and so it's important to recognize the right season and God interprets his word by vindicating it the word in its season so if you're looking for the Vindication of something the fruit of something if it's not the season for it it's not going to happen so you want to see it happen in its season and then this statement here to me is just perfect to tie in what we preached on Wednesday night on his coming or the Advent in spiritual food and due season this is the sermon he preached in the evening after he preached trying to do God service without it being his will he said but thanks be to God we've got hidden food it's spiritual food that we're living on the goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ in these last days vindicating himself among his people that's the time that we're living in we're living off the goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse I mean it's translated to coming it means manifestation and so just don't think Revelation is something that pops in your head like aha there's something very real very literal to it we're living on the goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the last days that's what we're living on we're living in a time where he's promised to reveal himself he's promised to manifest himself and he's promised to do in a very particular way and that's when we ended on Wednesday night how brother random even as he comes to the preaches the church ages and he's going to preach the seals he finishes the church age summation up with and may his coming Rejoice your heart that there's something that ought to give us courage especially in light of all the negative things that can be said about laodicea especially in light of all the dark things that are happening in the world and all the challenges that we're facing economics and physical and health and all the things that press upon us we do have something that is sure and steadfast that we can rejoice in and that's what the prophet's trying to point us to not just the the darkness of laodicea but the light that has come to us at the open of the word now in Nehemiah chapter 8 we went through these verses in great detail before we're going to come at it again in a little bit different angle but still picking up on Revelations 5 and Revelations 10. but the word when it was open as we looked at these verses it was open during what the Bible called the season of our joy specific time of worship and praise one of the feasts and they the book is opened up and they start to weep and cry but they're told no this is a season of Joy this is a season of gladness and they make great mirth and so God planned he looked out over and orchestrated that this book that had been lost to them would be opened at a time of rejoicing because that's what the open of the book signifies the time of worship a time of rejoicing and a time of Praise so it holds a type for all of us and we read it in Deuteronomy chapter 16 verse 15 for seven days you were to celebrate in the presence of the Lord your God at the place where the Lord will choose because the Lord your God will bless you in all your Harvest and everything you do and your joy will be complete I don't know about you but I don't want a half Joy I don't want a quarter joint say well I'll just get whatever Joy I can get well I see where it's promised the fullness of joy so I'm just going to be a little greedy and say I want fullness of joy I want complete Joy because I see the Promise in the word of God and that's what I desire and so this is a scripture referring to that season of praise and worship and joy at the Feast of Booth Feast of the Tabernacles the time when this book is being opened and so that's what they were called to in the moment that the book was being restored and so I'm looking at Nehemiah chapter 8 and I see it holds a type in light of Revelations chapter 5 in Revelations chapter 10 the promises for our day in the last Sunday we identified several places in the message of the hour brother Brian was pointing to Revelations 10 Revelations 5 unfolding under his ministry says that Ezra opened the book on the side of all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up in verse 5 there Nehemiah 8 this is what's transpired in their time and it says that they the the Levites and the priests they gave sense to what was being read and they caused them to understand the eating these are all the things that are transpiring in this season of joy and then verses 11 and 12 is where I'd like to is to read these together it says and so the Levites still all the people saying hold your peace for the day is Holy neither be aggrieved and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and descend portions and to make great mirth because now this you got to recognize the reason for their Joy they weren't just happy because Ezra opened a Dusty book They're not just happy because someone physically did something it's like oh we like it when he does that it just makes us giggle but no there was something to it to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them they were making a connection to it it was meaning something to them it was it was inspiring them so they began to make great mirth because they heard what was being said to them so their Joy was caused by understanding and it says they were to eat and to drink and descend portions this is a feasting they're enjoying God's provision as it would coincide with the time of the Harvest these would be things that God had provided by his hand promises that he made and and one thing that was standing out to me if you kind of research it and find what the commandment to send those to those to send portions to those that have not this was something that was written in their law something that was being restored to them and so they were giving what they had received from God they were given it to those who did not have provision who had not received just a tiny with evangelism and sharing what it is that you've received and so I hope that that kind of puts us all on the same basis at least thinking along the same events that we're going to try to tie in to things that have happened in our day and if you'll turn to Jeremiah chapter 15. I'd like to read verse 16 and and this will be kind of our launching point for where our hearts are today and if you could be very uh great attention to what is being said if you get a little bit tired or you need to get a drink of water I'm talking to the adults the kids just need to stay right where they are you make an announcement that you're welcome to use the water fountain there'll be a line of you know five to 12 year olds uh standing there for the rest of the service but no if you if you need to kind of wake yourself do so but I really ask that you just pay close attention to what we're sharing I I this to me this is just personal these are some things I've been studying on for a number of years that God's just allowed me to share at this time and to me it would be one of the most important things I've ever ministered and so I hope that you can stay pay very close attention to what's being shared and so in Jeremiah chapter 15 verse 16 it says thy words were found think of that parallel now we want to think about each catch each element in this verse and maybe apply it to what's been restored to us from this day and also how they must have been feeling in the book of Nehemiah and the Book of Ezra thy words were found which means to be present and and to be possessed you're presently with them thy words were found and I did eat them now there's this image then of a word being eaten and the Bible speaks of it in different places how there's this type of eating the scroll and eating the word and eating this these things that were found in Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart this is something that ought to be instructive to us that the word is the joy and rejoice and of our heart not temporal things not just churchianity not just things of the world or not things of the world that God would bless us with but his word is unto us the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name oh lord of hosts and so we want to make spiritual application to the season that we're in look at this verse and use it as kind of a type and phrases that apply to the time that we're living in because we're living in a season of the Fulfillment of scripture Luke 17 30 the day in this when the son of man is revealed we're living in the hour of Revelations chapter 10 in the time of first Thessalonians 4. there's a lot of scriptures we could use that brother Branham pointed us to says this is where you're living this is where you're living and so this verse uses a language that connects in and ties in to the very things that have been fulfilled in the time that we're living in we know in Revelations chapter 10 verses 7 to 11 as it speaks in the days of the voice of the seventh angel uh when he shall begin to sound that the mystery of God's going to be finished and then it comes to John he says the angel tells him go go to him that has the book and so he goes to him he says give me the little book and what does the angel say take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey there's a lot of things that we could Minister on how it's sweet to taste and bitter in the application and bitter in the processing but it says if my mouth sweet is honey and says I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter in other words you can count on what this Angel says it will happen exactly what he said the word will do to you it'll happen just exactly if you do what he tells you to do there's a lot that we can glean from this and he said unto me now notice now John and we'll see this later John has made declarations John has uh uh he is coming to the end of his life even but now as he takes this there's something said to him that is expressing what this word must do to us in the end time thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings so we are to Feast upon the contents of the book and not be selfish with it but just as they were to do in the days of Nehemiah send portions to those who do not have and so we are to eat the book but there were to prophesy again it's an echoing it's it's something sounding out again you're to declare and manifest again and so we have this responsibility and so you can see this parallel to Jeremiah 15 thy words were found and I did eat them and the word that I'm eating on became the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name this is we want to see this verse holding significance to what God is doing in this hour and he says I did eat them just like John ate the words was to take the book and eat it now this phrase here Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoice in of my heart because now he says because he was called by thy name O Lord of hosts so there's a reason he's actually given a reason why his heart is thrilled by joy and rejoice in my heart is your word but not just not just because the word sake because I was called I am called by thy name the the phrasing actually means named by thy name means you have chosen me to Bear your name you have had me to Bear your name I have been chosen by you now there's the key if you can just grab a hold of that when I say this is maybe one of the most important things I've ever ministered there's the key right there because there's so much misunderstanding about what it means to be named and what it means to hear your name what it means to call a name and we need to have very some Precision in the word of God in the message of the hour to recognize the significance of a name being called and so it says I am called by thy name I have now bear your name I have been named by your name or I have been chosen by by you so when he says that your words were found and I did eat them this is this is describing some sort of action your word is open to me and I'm eating it and then the understanding that is comes to him as he eats this is I am happy and I'm thrilled because I have been chosen and I now bear your name that through this process of opening unfolding in Revelation and me becoming a part of it I recognize that you have chosen me to Bear your name you've chosen me to sound out your truth you've chosen me to manifestly declare the full word so this is what is happening in Jeremiah this is even what is represented in John taking the contents of the book and as he eats it then he becomes a part of it and let's just put it this way if if John eats the book and the book isn't any more then it becomes a part of him and he becomes the only access to the contents of it as he prophesies it again so to be called by a name this is a focus on this part to be called by a name is an act of identifying something but it's not just an act of identification though that to me holds maybe the greatest weight but it's also an act of possessing and claiming something he says I have been chosen to Bear your name he has been possessed by and taken possession by God to where now he is not his own but he's the Lord's it's an act of placing someone in their position or calling I've been called by thy name you've placed me you've identified me you've chosen me you've possessed me you've placed me these are all things that relate to caught being called by a name so my title of name calling or wanting to look at very intently are the principles in the scripture to better understand what it means to be called by his name or what it means to have your name called to better understand this in Revelations chapter 5 verse 1 it says and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals this sealed book holds something significant to Heaven and Earth and it is and it is the impossibility of these contents being revealed that made John weep is that not right it says who's worth it open the book it says well we looked on Earth we looked around and no man was found worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof not even worthy to look at it and so it wasn't just the fact that no one stepped forward to take it that caused John to weep but it was the fact that what was in that book was very very important it was the book of redemption it held the mystery of the Lamb's Book of Life brother Branham says here he stands holding his right hand over his heart where the hidden secrets of redemption had been hid since the foundation of the world that's what signified in the scene the very secrets of redemption have been hid since the foundation of the world and in verse 6 it says and I beheld and lo in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain because there's announcement wheat not the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth and all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne what a statement he came brother remember says the most Sublime thing in scripture it's a Sublime act so this is an ape this is a peak this is the climax of redemption he comes and he takes the book and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne that's the image we want to have in our minds is now this is redemption's claim he's coming forward to take the book to grasp this book and when this happens I think we pointed this out last Sunday at the time that John is weeping he is told and this is an accurate statement I weep not for the lion of the trabajuda hath prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof so who opened the book The Lion that is his present designation that is what he is that is what he looks like listen if you even look at that um when he made the appearance and he put the sign in the sky of the cloud when you look at the cloud of this guy looks like a lion's mane I it not just look at it and see in a wigged one an authority a supreme judges brother bam identifies it but it also identifies the fact that he is now being identified as a lion so when John looks and he sees who has done this he's described as he sees the lamb as it had been slain now don't let appearance fool you it's the lamb that had been slain but now he's a lion and so it's important to catch the identification change from lamb to lion we need to recognize that in in verse verse 5 to verse 6 how there has been a change now in verse 13 we're going to read this and what I want us to recognize is that John's fault John's response to this is directly connected to the open of the book in Revelations 5 13. this is cause and effect as as in every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne under the lamb forever and ever I recall that when John is to take the book and to eat the book and when he takes the book it eats it he said that must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and kings in other words it has this description where it's going to make it circuits around the earth you must prophesy what you have just eaten of and now he says you prophesy again and what made me think of this is that John has already rejoiced and shouted and the whole earth heard him he says and he says blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and of the Lamb forever and ever this is John's response to the seals being opened so what prompted his Jubilation what what prompted his rejoicing not just the fact the seals are open not just the act of the Lamb taking the book but what it declared and what it meant just as it says thy words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart it wasn't just because the book was found but it was because you called me by thy name and John's rejoicing has something to do with name calling in the breach brother Branham says what a jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb leaves that intercessory box to come here to possess his claim now when he makes that statement intercessory box maybe we actually picture a literal box that Christ is is in to intercede that we need to recognize dispensations and moments when God is doing something so now he says what a jubilee is taking place in heaven when the lamb leaves that to come here to possess his claim now for some people that would be a moment of weeping wait he's not interceding anymore but he's actually saying it's actually a time of rejoicing when he does this to possess his claim he says you know that God next to John right that meaning that I think I've really got him excited he got next got beside himself he must have saw his name wrote there when the seals broke he must have got real happy but why brother Branham is making these statements they might seem to be just uh maybe filler or just him kind of uh you know amplifying what what has been said and maybe taking some Liberty with it but this is not just a one-time statement that he kind of just says it and kind of passing oh he got really excited he must have seen his name just as an aside this might be the most important commentary about it because John's getting really excited and John's rejoicing but the question is why is John getting all happy why is John shouting why is John praising why is there Jubilation going on in heaven and for John it's personal he's just not excited because the Angels got excited he's not just rejoicing because the elders Rejoice this is something personal to John and so the opening of the sealed book declared if we could say it this way declare John's John's name in such a way that when the book was open he got happy because he saw his name so his name is identified in the open of this book and now if I could say this about John but I want to say this about us it's not our understanding of History it's not our connection with history it's not just an event that we're excited about oh isn't this a neat event oh like maybe we celebrate uh certain holidays because this is the day that somebody did this and we celebrate something because this is the day that this happened and it's merely an acknowledgment of the historical fact this is John's rejoicing is not in an event John's rejoicing is not in something just just had just transpired but for him there was a personal identification in Christ something happened and now he's personally getting caught up into saying wow if this isn't for anyone else this is for me how many of you ever told a preacher that right he said that probably wasn't for anyone else that was just for me and you and we say that why because we so identify with it that sometimes we're just so sure that that was so chopped up and uh messy and so hard to understand but I caught something so it must have only been for me all right there's times when you think there's just this is only for me I'm the only one that got anything out of this is and there's got to be a personal identification and that's what's happening with John it's not history it's not an event it's exactly what Jesus is wanting Mary and Martha to recognize at the resurrection of Lazarus is they're looking for an event a future event that once it transpires then it becomes history and we think the open of the seals it's a prophesied event once it happens it becomes history and though there is a moment that we can say That's History the significance has to hold the present reality and what Jesus was telling Mary and Marth at the time of the resurrection of their brother is I am the resurrection and the life it's not a date on the calendar it's a person it is something that has an identification it's something that has a life and so John he said he saw his name written there and he got real happy John is making personal identification with what is loosed in that and brother Brandon this is where we're going to tie you in brother Brandon Christ is the mystery God revealed he says now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer he says she is him so he's saying and all that would be in this book is him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him so there's the there's the tie and he said well it's Christ but you're you're in him so he says all that's in the book is the believer that's for that's the believer the words in the book and all and the word is him and all that's in that so that is this is the personal identification he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as the lamb and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there now if you think about that just in what he's referring to the names are written on the book before the foundation of the world and here he is today manifesting what he wrote on the book there here he is today manifesting these very things manifesting the believer who is the book who are the words in the book because she is him and in Psalms 139 verses 16 and 17 just so you can see that these this image that's often painted in scripture says that eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect brother Brown said their names are written on the book before the foundation the world before we ever came into existence there was a reality to you to who you are God's thoughts are Eternal they are real so he says yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written remember how brother Brown talks about God took your picture I'm so glad it wasn't at 47. we have it we have a tradition in our family where we write at the end of the year we write in a book our prayers and it's personal we don't read one another's and I'm many pounds off my goal from a couple years ago and so uh you pray for me and I will make this a public prayer request now but uh God took your picture remember says he put it in his great file right took you at your best he's a perfect picture of you and if that's the picture that means to materialize so God has a photo album as it were of all of his children those that make up his body and he says in thy book all my members were written which in continuous where fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are there thought are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them why does he refer to the thoughts because God's thoughts are Eternal they are real and God's thought of you is that perfect picture God's thought of you is this record is this Lamb's Book of Life representation of who you are and who your person is and it's in this book these members are written in a book names are written on a book and this would be one reason why John would get all sad because he's maybe looking at this saying if I'm ever going to be there the record's in that sealed book and so what about just to him that believeth and what about the person that did good what about the person that did this he says no I'm looking at something totally different I'm thinking about a name that has been written that can never be removed I'm talking about being an eternal attribute of God I'm talking about Redemption I'm talking about salvation I'm not just talking about getting in on the day of judgment I'm talking about someone who's there in the beginning that's what I was promised that's what I believed this is the Vindication of it brother Branham says in the four seal he said God opened the seals that's the reason I think John was doing all the shouting the other night he's referring to when he preached the bridge and maybe John was shouting again hey makes it so personal like you know that this ought to be in our language you know brother random said the other day right I'm like wait when did you talk to him but we want to be listening and this is kind of sounds like brother Branham and brother John were hanging out he says John was doing all the shouting the other night he's referring to the breach he must have seen his name on there okay there's another reference to it that his excitement his Jubilation his enthusiasm wasn't just oh well the seals are open yay the seals are open we can be different no it was a personal identification with what happened he must have seen his name and he says on there in other words what he was quickened to him at the opening was personal and the sermon the breach he says it this way again oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestation and old John who'd been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in the earth everything in the sea heard me holler amen blessings honor and might and power to be to him that lives forever and ever talk about a happy time when them seals broke again this is our season of Joy notice how there's rejoice and there's praise there's jubulation there's enthusiasm associated with God fulfilling his promised word in particular the opening of these seals he says all the glory the manifestation the hallelujahs the shouts the anointed the power the glory the manifestation talk about a happy time when the seals were opened he says John must have looked and so past the curtain of time and said now this is just to me a real unique statement there's John oh he was so happy remember the story brother bam tell us about the boy he saw a mirror for the first time or at least we've heard the story and he's and it's portrayed where this kid comes from the country into the city sees Amir for the first time he's kind of like what's going on here and like man you know wow this is really interesting and uh who could this person be and I someone was showing a video of that one time of a guy who was uh intoxicated he couldn't get past himself in the mirror and and so they couldn't make it by him and because he was seen as his reflection and somebody was watching the video says what are the chances that somebody would be dressed like just like him that's somebody who's not catching what's happening but John like that little kid who looked in the mirror said whoa there's John in other words that's me what he saw again what he said there's John he didn't just see j-o-h-n because then we could have an argument right how many of you know somebody named John all right then you could have an argument Josh said no I'm the first John no I'm the first John all right we got the First Baptist Church of and they all claimed to be the first I was the first John I was the one he was talking about but this is a something personal he says there's John he wasn't just saying a name he was thinking of himself so there's me oh and he was happy just like that kid who looked in the man says mama that's me so this is I'm taking I'm maybe going to slow down just a little bit to share something that can be from an academic standpoint a lot a lot of things we could share a lot of things that can be talked about because it's actually very very broad area that's constantly growing but he says there's John this is recognition of self this is John seeing something saying well that's me like like if you saw a picture and it can be oh it's very particular where you show somebody a picture it doesn't matter how old it is or where it's from people just have a way of saying well that's that's me I recognize myself and very rarely are you showing a picture where you don't recognize yourself you're like I'm I don't know who that is that can't be me that guy's way too heavy right like that that I have please tell me I have more hair than that and so there's a there's a recognition of self based upon if you could catch this self-representation so there's a wrecking you recognize something self-recognition based upon how you how you represent yourself or how you're represented to yourself it's the idea of self and so he saw himself when he said there's John there's almost this instinctual uh and I want to say childlike but it's not childlike but it is it is just so um innocent there's me that's me and he sees it when he saw himself it was like it's core identity his core person not just the name like we go to how special is it when you go to uh Cracker Barrel and they've got all these mugs and you see one that says John you know can you believe it they got a mug with John on it right that that's not that's not a big surprise right but if you had Lucas with the K maybe like yes yes and and so this is John then what he's recognizing is something that is very very personal it was self-recognition based upon self-representation John had some and I wish I just had uh I I guess I feel constrained but John had some anchoring belief in his heart about who he was and what made him what he was like when there was something maybe deep even if it had been hidden even if he never fully understood it when this finally represented itself he said that's who I am that's me something was confirmed something was made known to him that was a releasing that's something that was like I'll never weep another tear a day in my life after this happens now that I've seen this if something that was transformative but it was anchored and who he believed he was and so self-representation that's how we Define ourselves it's how we see ourselves maybe it's a subject of great debate these days but self-representation influences our thinking how we feel how we behave self-representation how you see yourself how you view yourself what you think about yourself how you would Define yourself forms your identity sometimes there's a there's not a self-representation but people kind of take on certain identities well they're my weird one or they're the ones that like this and they're the ones and they have ways where they force themselves to kind of form a particular identity but when someone really recognizes uh they have some sort of even if it's right or correct however you want to look at it self-representation is an identity influences the way you think the way you act the way you behave the way you feel and this self-representational Behavior this is maybe this is the scientific part it begins to emerge in infants and and babies once a certain once certain parts of the brain begin to form so this ability to recognize something and to that they even do these experiments to where uh putting something on a baby's face and using a mirror are they able to recognize where it is at and remove whatever it is based upon self-representation that's me that's the Mark it's on my face here this is what I'll do to get it off there's ways that they've studied this and so self-representational Behavior includes recognizing yourself in a mirror uh describing yourself maybe even describing your mental state I'm I'm I'm hungry perfect time to do that is when you're in trouble I'm really hungry uh there's certain things that babies will do and children do they can recognize I'm sad I'm tired this is recognizing their person now something that is very unique to self-representational behavior or the brain recognizing who you are one of the things that they can use for this is hearing your name and they find that here in your name has the same brain activation activation as self-representation Behavior so here in your name lights up the same parts of your brain as seeing your reflection in a mirror here in your name will light up certain parts of the brain the same way when you begin to think about yourself and how you feel them so your name is associated with more than just well how do we you know how do we organize things and how do we know when you're talking to child one child to a child three he goes by it's more than just the name this is what one of the studies concluded hearing your own name causes your brain to react as if you're engaging in the behaviors and thought patterns that serve as some of your core identity and personality markers here in your name engages the brain and causes the brain to react in the same way that it would when you're doing things that serve to manifest your core personality and your core identity so your name is not just an appellation it's just it's not nominative but it becomes something to the person to where when you hear your name the brain gets excited in such a way in the same way that happens when you are expressing yourself who you really are and what your core person is how many remember Dale Carnegie's statement remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language there's something to a name um ever heard of the cocktail party effect you might have to spend a couple service on what a cocktail party is but it's in a crowd cocktail party effect they describe it as being in a party or crowd and you're at a luncheon or you had a function you're at a Christmas dinner and the cocktail party effect is your ability to focus on a specific stimulus by filtering out all the other stimuli in the room all the other noise and and this is the fact that the brain can do the brain can focus in on something and and and tune everything else out and hear something in particular and they've studied this from different aspects and one of the ways that they tried to study it the cocktail party effect is by asking somebody to focus on something a certain sound like you're going to listen to this speaker and you're going to Shadow it and you repeat whatever this thing says and so there's all these other sources of information but you're to listen you're to listen to this it's called shadowing and what they found is that you could be saying five ten and you've got all these other things that are being said maybe it's a song Maybe it's noise but you're shadowing something and they said but as soon as your name is called you can you know it even if it comes from a source you're not shadowing even if it comes from a place you're not tuning in and so one of the things that that cocktail effect is party effect is you can be sitting there talking and talking in that great loyal in that great and that wonderful and someone says do you see the sock put the Aaron has on you like brother Aaron what right you hear immediately it's something you have your name there's something about your name and so it's such an important phenomenon of this idea and even in this study this is one of the conclusions they came to and studying this is that that people never Tire of hearing their name because they could they could just keep saying you've listened to your name you listen to your name you listen to your name and then other names would be repeated and they'd always have the ability to know despite all the other names that are being mentioned all the other stimuli everything has been happening there's something about that name that means something more to them when they study this on children they'll even find that if you just change it sounds like their name but it's not their name it means nothing to them it recognized just even the slightest distinction you couldn't yell and say ack come here no he's waiting for Jack right you can't get it close it's got to be precise so much more we could share on this maybe you could just think about it on your own time but this this is the part that I thought was amazing as I studied this this phenomena the way our minds work and in relation to our brain and again it's not just a name it's who you think you are self-recognition based upon self-representation is such a powerful phenomena our brains will involuntarily respond at the sound of our names and that's where they have uh your brain is being imaged and you're shadowing something and you may not even be asked to respond but as soon as you hear your name that part of your brain will light up and they find that we will in our brains will involuntarily you don't have to do it perform an action you don't have to acknowledge it but you could be focusing on something shadowing something shattering something else and your name gets called and your brain knows it and your brain responds and there's actually a chemical reaction that takes place within your brain for those neurons to be fired for that part of the brain to light up it's so powerful that our brains without us making a conscious effort or even doing any activity will respond to it it's so powerful that they found the brains of patients in a persistent vegetative state are stimulated by their name they don't they can't do anything else they are in a vegetative state persistent vegetative state and they will they will say a person's name by and scan their brain and the Brain will still respond to it everything else is non-functional but the brain responds to the name children under sedation will respond selectively to the sound of their own first name a child that's been sedated who cannot respond anything cannot act cannot raise their hand if they hear their name the brain still gets it I want you to think about how powerful this is especially in light of the fact that we come to the day when the the the wise is sleeping along with the foolish and there's been no Revival to wake up the bride and to stir her up and you think well what's going to do it what's going to cause it she's asleep our name Will stimulate us even when we're unable to respond or act on anything else you may not be able to raise your hand you may not be able to say that's me but there's something inside of you that can recognize your name and respond when nothing else can respond why it's listening for its name it's one it's going to hear that's why you ever ever thought that your all your smart devices and you're like well it's it's not listening to you say its name well then it's Somewhere listening then it's Somewhere listening always listening for its name right that ought to scare you a little bit and Jeff Bezos still hasn't paid his ties our name Will stimulate us even in a sedated asleep and so this is where we're wanting to zero in on is John's response was connected with his name being called he must have saw his name wrote there he must have seen his name on there he looked past the curtain of time and said there's John right he this was identity this is self recognition and there is a deeper meaning for John because for John it's not just okay well my name's in a book there was a prophetic command from Christ that his Joy ought to be anchored in that very thing so there's something for John this meant more to him this had a deeper meaning in Luke 10 20 notwithstanding this Rejoice not don't Rejoice because the devils are subject to you don't Rejoice because you have power over this and you have power don't Rejoice because you can speak in tongues and God's restored his power in the rain has fallen and signs and wonders and miracles Rejoice not in these things alone that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven and this is the moment where John has it Vindicated and confirmed the promise for his day Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and this is what John could return to when when John sees his name it wasn't just like oh well imagine that he could connect it to Christ he connect connected to the word he can say this is the moment that Jesus said should be a cause of my joy this is the time that Jesus said I ought to Rejoice so we've got to think more deeply than just a name but think about John's identity and the fact that Christ had centered him on this reality don't get happy in religion don't get happy in enthusiasm don't just Rejoice because you're rejoicing but you've got to have a real reason for it he said I'll give you a reason Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and as names written in heaven as Jesus says it has more weight than just a record it refers to your inheritance it refers to your identity that's what I was wanting to emphasize in the idea of self-recognition the name is just not a name but it means something I know you'll recognize this statement and be able to connect it to a number of different places and the sermon question and answers I believe this is uh part three says why did and this isn't a lot of uh he uses this this um this in a few places he says why did Aaron have on his breastplate the birthstone of each one of those Patriarchs look at those mothers when they give utterance when the mothers them Hebrew women in labor giving others to those children be born it placed their name and he talks about in other places an adoption series to how they cried out their name at their birth and he said as they did that it just wasn't giving them a name at that moment but it was actually placing them where they'd be in the Promised Land even today there's a Jewish tradition they wait till the eighth day to reveal the name of a son even it's still a Jewish tradition it's very the the naming uh the naming of a child is very important in Jewish tradition he says it plays their name it told their birth it put them in the Homeland sent them over to Eternity it says one of these days when I come in and stay a little time I want to take that subject exactly and then watch Jacob when he was dying there when he laid his hands upon the Patriarchs and blessed them he was telling them exactly where they would be now watch this they're named now now there's an actual place he says and that's exactly according to their name and exactly according to their birth sure it has something to do with you now that's your birth path that's what you are a natural man or a natural woman what is he referring to names he says why would the the birthstones represent the Patriots why would the mothers give utterance what he's giving this thought and I realize now there's some other statements that might have been more um direct to this and I have a few later on this morning but he says this is exactly according to their name it has something to do with you so the name is more than just a convenience it's more than something I would just kind of think about and dream up and say oh well I want to have a name that has so many syllables and really it's something you ought to be very prayerful about because there's something to that name he says it's your birth path and Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 12 and the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them they're rejoicing their mirth their enthusiasm their their Joy was caused by understanding The Words of the open book but there was a personal identification with the words there's I how many of you well I'll try to think of just exactly the right way to say this if somebody said hey I want to read to you what a person who's born on January 2nd is like if you're not born on January 2nd you might humor me right and if you don't know anybody right it doesn't mean much but if do you want to hear what someone born on your birthday you know let's hear all the good things as soon as they say something bad now I don't think that's it quick to disagree no that's not me no that's that's not right and uh so there's something that you make a personal identification with it and so when they had the words of these book opened up it's isn't that why sometimes we ask who said that right because it doesn't have any weight does it have any significance uh if there's is as we share gifts with one another during the season and we have gifts what is it you look for you're just not excited about wrapped gifts right you want to see your shot your name on it right you want to see that's me this is something for me and so there's a there was for them when the book was open and they began to make great mirth there's some prior events that had transpired that kind of built up to this moment to where they're not just hearing the words of a distant relative this isn't just like well maybe this is related to who we are as Jews but they had a personal identification with the words it held deep personal significance it's not something forward foreign not something unrelated but the this word was their inheritance it was their Heritage it was their identity if you talk about the children of Israel why were they called the children of Israel because they could trace themselves back to Israel right it wasn't because they were born you could say I'm I'm a child of Texas well that means that you were just born in a particular place but if you're if you're in Israel Israelite if you were a Jew there was a lot that that meant and notice this in Nehemiah chapter 7 verse 5 and my God put into my heart this is chapter seven right before chapter eight where they opened this book my God put into my heart to gather together the Nobles and the rulers and the and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy and I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first and found written therein I just want you to allow that just to just lean in against you a little bit be heavy because now this is what happens so when the book is open in Nehemiah chapter 8 and they begin to understand and appreciate the contents of the book and they enter into their season of rejoicing they're not doing it ignorantly they're not doing it naively they're not doing it religiously they're not just doing it because Mom and Dad did it they're not doing it because it's just kind of the move for the day but the open the the when they reckon by genealogy they find a book that's the register of genealogy a scroll that has all the names of the families and the descendants of the sons and the descents of Israel and so they opened that up in order to find out who they are to determine identity and in determining identity they can determine inheritance you're of this tribe you're of this son you're of this you're being placed in your position and this is what the open of the word means to us by type verse 63 of the same chapter and the priests the children of habaya this is um an example of what happened the children of cause the children of Barcelona which took one of the daughters of barcelai the gileadite to wife and was called after their name so they they had a because of marriage and everything they didn't have an original name but they wanted to go back well this is what this person's name was and I was a I was a children of cuz and they and they sought their register they sought their name they sought their entry among those that were reckoned by genealogy but it was not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood oh that's some pretty heavy language but what is it showing it's showing that there was a book with names written in it that they could reckon their identity who they were presently by what was written in that book and here's one says well my name got changed and this happened can you find my name in there so that I could serve in the priest and said nope there's no record the name's not written there that's what this book represented is to have these names written in it that someone could go back and Trace their genealogy trace their bloodline Trace their inheritance back to the names that are written in this book and this is what I'm trying to express to you at the open of the word there's a name calling and a name even if you look at the the definition of name the name anoma and the scripture covers everything that comes to mind when you hear the name so it's not just name but when you use a name the name covers so if we were to uh mention a particular person's name here and we would immediately we just wouldn't think of that name we'd start thinking about the car they drive where they sit at church whether they're married whether they have children right you begin to think about a lot whether or not they sent us a Christmas card this year and actually wrote on it there's a lot of things maybe you start thinking about and you start because you're building this idea of who they are and that's what a name is it covers their Authority their possessions their inheritance their interests and brother Brown says and I don't know that I have some of these statements here I just need to go quickly it says the church name is associated with the nature of its character we preach the revelation of Jesus Christ he says the name is associated with the nature of its character your name is related to your character he says it's the church name that has something to do with the character of the church the very word name itself comes from the root of understanding or knowledge so that's what the name ought to give understanding and knowledge in Acts chapter 15 it says he's going to call out of people from the Gentiles for his name's sake again this name is used for his namesake it covers everything it's to covers anything that's brought to mind when you hear the name position Authority pleasure all those things I said what we want to recognize what name cone is how the name is so significant program says the voice of God in the last days you ever notice our boys our young boys have become Ricky and Elvis says you got a child named that change it right quick call him number one or two or something that's great there's calm one or two or something it says what difference does the name the name mean why sure it means something your name characterizes your life now maybe maybe what I want needing you to do now is to invert because if we put everything on the name first like oh well the name means this and the name means this but oftentimes and again this comes from some of the Hebrew tradition the name corresponds to the life that's manifest now you would give a name based upon characteristics and attributes not the inverse where they get a name and then that becomes associated with certain characteristics and so he says your name characterizes your life so there's a little bit of inversion here in what God does is it's the life that counts it's the life that matters now brother bam you're on numerology no I'm not I'm on thus saith the Lord why wasn't when Jacob when he lived to his name as a deceiver supplanter Jacob and when God changed him he changed his name God changed Saul to Paul Simon to Peter certainly it has something and Ricky and Elvis and such names as that is the modern American name which throws a child automatically right into that so it shows there is something to the name that will actually be associated with and characterizes a particular life and it has awakened and it has an influence this is the power at your name oh it's just a name it's just a name you better think about that name research suggests that names influence your profession where you live who you marry the grades you make the stocks you invest in whether you get accepted into school hired for a job or the quality of work you do in a group setting this is what research has indicated that a name can dictate these different things there was a Harvard study done and there's been subsequent studies it's maybe a little bit controversial but there's been a number of studies that's kind of touched on this very same thing they found that rare odd names have a negative psychological effect on the one that bears it right a rare name an odd name and they did this study amongst hundreds of graduates and found that people who named Mike uh and uh getting some heads perked up what other names could I remember that were in this these certain names they tended to farewell you know but people named I can't remember what the name was like very rare or something like that like they didn't fare too well and yeah maybe you say well chances are you know you have a lot of Daniels or you have a lot of this you have a lot of that you're going to have a higher instances of it but they found at least some correlation of a negative psychological effect if you have an odd or a different name and brother Brandon's saying there's a your name characterizes your life the church name has something to do with the nature of its character that you can name a child something that throws them automatically into something and this is what brother Brown said there's something to a name and now there's actually research to back it up and what did Jesus say when he came in John 17 26 I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it did he just what did he go around saying Jesus Jesus no the Declaration of a name was manifesting one's character the Declaration of a name was a certain attributes being displayed power being used certain rights being declared that that's what's in a name to declare the name doesn't mean Jesus was just letting everybody in on what they called the big man upstairs or what his name actually is it to declare his name was to declare his nature his attributes his character his authority that's what it means to declare a name so in the Bible when brother man says John saw his name and he said there's John this was a life this was an identity this was an inheritance this was a possession if I could say it this way I I'm wanting to emphasize to you that it was more than just him hearing his name more than them just him seeing John but something was expressed that he personally identified with but even if it was a name it meant more than just a name and so how does this relate then the opening of the seals relate to the bride's season of joy John sees the name John sees the name John sees the name makes him happy makes them excited we've been building all this uh how the name he found with me in this uh do we need to have service on Christmas I'll fly back in town to do this if I need to there's something that gets the mind going something that stimulates the person they get excited something to the name and what I want you to recognize is there's more to it than just saying Hey Brother Tom right that there's a there's a life there's an identity there's a personal identification brother Ram says in the message the breach we read this I believe on Wednesday night talk about a jubilee talk about a time when this lamb walked forth the books even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are saved is my name there I don't know I hope it is on March 17th he says this but if it's if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world now watch what he says next but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book open the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are because remember what's in the book and he even he even I don't think this is a mistake he even prefaces is my name in there and he says I don't know I hope it is but he's going to loose the seals and he's going to send it down to earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people reveal what reveal what what's in the book he comes back the next day and he says in the in the first seal and the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names are in there all about it what a great thing so these are some things we get down to First principles these are some things that we can look at and say okay names are written in the book and the sealed book there's going to be names that are revealed in the book he says it comes down to the seventh angel Messenger to reveal it to his people the bride's names are put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and now it's being revealed whose names are in there can we follow that I say at the very least you could disagree but I'm just saying what he said he said now it's been revealed whose names are in there then he's asked several days later in question answers on the seals in the morning before he preaches the seventh seal he makes this statement nothing will be saved only those whose names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile that's all the book holds that mystery Let's uh let's just focus here it's 11 39 so now you know what time it is we're gonna we're gonna get through this we're gonna make it the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now the mystery and then he says this not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names there's this kind of this Nuance that's something very subtle here and he says you understand that now the book doesn't say now leave elves to be saved in the time of this church age or Ormond Neville or whoever know it don't say that now this this community this changes things because if there's names written there now he says it doesn't say arm and Neville in this age and leave ill in this age and uh Micah Torres in this age if it doesn't actually say that I'm I'm listening now it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it now if we if we really focus on this we can catch that brother Branham has given us some greater specificity about what the name being called is though it may not actually say Lee veil in Ormond Neville and these different things he clarifies what the name being called is because he says the book holds a mystery and the mystery's unfolding not each one's names or Neville Lee Veil but the mystery of the book while it's calling those names so the mystery the Revelation the mystery is what's unfolding and that's what's calling your name it's a revelation of self there's a self-recognition there's an identity that's happening John when the seals were loosed he said that's me that's John when the mystery unfolded it called his name but did it have to say well John the Baptist will be and John the Revelator will be and Orman never will be did it have to say the actual name the idea the Revelation the mystery he's saying is what's calling your name not the name your parents gave you could you imagine how confusing that would be if you're given one name they decided to change it a few years later it's not your name but the idea of calling your name is God's act this is my final thought here so you can see this because it's it's perfectly in line with the scripture it's God's Act of identifying you and and choosing you uh and not just it's this process of identifying choosing and year 19. I think we might have said that in the beginning name calling it's an act of identifying something choosing something and then placing it not by name but by character not merely by name but by attribute it's there's other people I'm sure you've all done this and you could say Amen or raise your hand but you've Googled your name or you've binged your name or whatever it is you use duck ducked your name you've looked your name up you know what there's other people named whatever your name is no matter how rare it is there's probably somebody else that's got your name and so it's more than just the name it's who you actually are it's not just by appearance or by name it's character it's life it's identity it's self-recognition give you an example in first Samuel 16. God has turned taking the anointing away from Saul he's going to choose a new king and he tells the prophet to go to the house of Jesse and call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee now wouldn't have it been great if he just said go to Jesse's and call David I'm boom it's over right there right right they know who David is he's the young guy in the field but yet that's not exactly how it happened he says go and I will anoint unto him whom I name unto thee one that I will call by my name one that I will identify one that I will place it says in verse one that I have provided me a king from among his sons so God had already chosen David God already knew who he was God already had him identified in his heart God all he had that name but now he's going to name him and the prophet's going to go to the house of Jesse to name the next king of Israel and it's not that he's going to give him a new name you from now on are going to be known as DaVita you're it's not something changing but it's actually the one I'm going to choose the one that I'm going to name is the one I'm going to choose and in several places the god when the sun comes up he says the Lord hath not chosen Thee the Lord hath not chosen thee and in verse 12 he says this is he God then identity by by by looking at the point and he named him how did he name him by identifying him and at that point then maybe the name's just an afterthought I don't care what his name is this is the king could you imagine if he went to George Foreman's house and he says I'm coming to your house because the next King's going to be George because which one I think he named all of his kids George or George Gina or Georgia or something so I mean could you imagine hey hey I'm here to name a king and his name's David and Jesse's like you know what just had this weird thing I want all my kids to be named David which David then he has to start looking okay Lord who are you going to name who is it you're going to name in verse 7 he says the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or the height of a stature because I've refused him for the Lord seeth not his man saith for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart this is what it means to be named to call your name oh I pray to God you're catching this to call your name is something deeper than him just saying what your mom and dad call you in John Chapter 14 verse 3 just have a this I'd be looking at now this is my last scripture I think I'll make reference to that should mean maybe not too much don't give too much weight to that got several quotations to read though John 14 3 and if I go and prepare a place for you what does he say just prior to this let heart let not your heart be troubled I'm sharing with you these things so that in me you'll find peace and me you'll find Joy if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also could be that this sermon here this part here is worthy of a much broader attention maybe a service in itself but I will come again I will return I will come back and receive you remember he comes three times he says I'll come again and receive you unto myself this last statement we read Wednesday night and broken cisterns why don't you turn to him where God is our abundant supply of Joy our abundant Supply and Praises our abundant Supply and satisfaction the calmness of my nerves comes from God when I'm tore up I find my satisfaction in Christ not in a cigarette not in the things of the world not enjoying some Cree Creed but in finding him the promised word that he said if I go away I will come again to receive you I find my joy in that he says he is my joy there's something in this that God wants us to Joy in he says if I if I go away I will come again and receive you unto myself this word receive literally means to take with oneself to join to oneself it means to choose one as a companion so it says I will come and I will take you to myself I will come and choose you so this coming now this is I want you to recognize this and this calling our name the the name coin it means more than just uh hoping that you hear the the enunciation of a name that somebody's given you or even a new uh nomination that God may give you that relates to a natural name but this coming is an act of salvation this is him receiving this this receiving the script says is him taking what he's already chosen just as God had already chosen David but now he had the prophet had to go into this house and he had to name the one that God had Chosen and he didn't just show up say this name on this paper he's the next king something had to manifest he had to see it by attribute he had to see it by character and that was the naming now when Jesus says I will come again and receive you unto myself it's the same concept of naming you have chosen me I've taken the book and I've eaten it and your word is a joy and rejoice in my heart because I have been called by your name you have chosen me to Bear your name you have taken me and you have placed me the word has identified who I am and that's exactly what this means this receiving is him coming to take what he's chosen the prophecy this is prophecy of his coming as a bridegroom to claim his bride to unite with her brother Brandman souls in prison now he says then the lamb came for what he redeemed he come to claim what he had redeemed he's already got it right here in the book taken it from his hand now he's coming to receive what he's redeemed that's his work he's done he's come to receive it I think we read it last service last Sunday but now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals are open have been opened so the seventh seals are open to do what call the bride now is the bride called the bridegroom call will come right through this now when the Bride come in of Christ there's a language brother I'm choosing to try to articulate this truth that the word been restored in this hour is to bring you forth to receive you unto himself the the whole revelation of the son of man is a union between Christ the word and his bride and the proving his word Brotherhood says at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called in that day the son of man be revealed to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the Bride this is what's happening this time there's a United now coming into receiving to myself I'll come again to take you as my companion come to take you to myself to unite with you this is the name this is what it means to be called by his name this is what it means to have our name called even in the concept of the in Western culture in the wedding ceremony because not every wedding ceremony is the same as ours but in the western culture just as a type the woman changes her name at the time of marriage right whenever the engagement announcement is sent out you have the parents uh announcing the the engagement of their son and their daughter and they're still unique family identifications but what the you once the union takes place is I now introduce to you Mr and Mrs Aaron McGeary and she's her identity now has been assumed into that of the bridegroom her she is no longer fiancee she is no longer a uh uh someone that's engaged no longer a girlfriend but now the word changes and we call her on her wedding day bride but what does she become she becomes wife so there's a name change there's a designation change why because now she has been chosen to bear his name and to actually be a manifestation of his character she actually becomes the first revelation of what he wants his home to be a revelation of the future home and brother Bram says in the first seal and remember all these different statements we've been reading in the first silly says now it's been revealed whose names are in that book so it comes back later in that sermon he says and it's only to be revealed in the last days when the actual seal is broken broken to who it's not broken to Christ he says not to Christ but to the church notice now oh my that just makes me tremble there's something about this opening it's making him tremble oh my this is so significant it just makes me tremble he says I hope that the church fully understands it see what I mean you people and then he makes this I know you've all heard it many times before he says I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it and that's when he comes to this critical point reason who are the Seals open to who are the Seals open to and he says the church but then he says all this makes me tremble why because it's not to everyone it's to a specific group of people that God has already chosen in his heart a very group of people that God has set his Prophet just as he did the prophet to Jesse's house he's got a name he's got a name the queen he's got to name the wife he's got a name the bride and so he says I just can't say church because there's a lot of people that call themselves church but I'll call you bride so that you'll understand just as they reckoned the genealogy first and everyone found their identity in the Scrolls and found their identity in the genealogy then the book was opened and they understood the meaning and they could have great rejoice and he says I'm going to call you bride so that you understand what I'm saying this is the name calling not the Annunciation of the name that your parents gave you not the Earthly name the the clarified or declined an earthening but it's an anointing on a Heavenly calling it's the anointing of a Heavenly identity if you see this in different places why would he change or just why would he change the name why would he just keep saying church because once you change the name it changes things I found this out in the Spanish language I was in Honduras one year and um I was sitting down with an evangelist whose travels Hunters quite a bit very very frequently and um and he said we have ministers meetings every month and so we have dozens well over 50 ministers that come I mean we've been doing it for years I'm like that sounds awesome and I said do you guys ever have any disagreements right I'm getting the popcorn out tell me what you guys debate about oh no we've never had any disagreements I'm like well you guys aren't really talking no disagreements for there anybody I said in all these years you guys don't ever you've never had difference of opinions he goes oh well we had one guy who was trying to tell us that that the um the church is now the bride I'm like good Bueno yeah I like the CC uh and and he goes and he goes and um so he and I said so what was the problem again he goes well brother Branham called it uh said that the church was a no to Novia or his Novia and he's saying and so in the Spanish it means girlfriend and so they'd actually taken everything where brother Brandon was saying uh bride or using a word they're translating it to Novia and it conveyed the idea that we're still just engaged it's just as engaged it's just a girlfriend just a fiance and he's saying this guy was trying to tell us esposa and I'm like SI esposa that's correct oh right and I said well bro I'm gonna tell you I just have to I have to agree with that guy because this is what brother Brown was trying to show us is that we are not the one who's merely been a spouse we're not merely the girlfriend we're not in the age where we just just keep looking at the engagement ring and think this is wonderful but now's the time and the hour of the invisible Union now's the age where he comes to join himself with his bride brother Brown says it notice how he says this because this is why he's using a different name if this is where I'm like man I just wish I was a better preacher just wish I was a preacher that when you think why do you have to use a different name if you think about how what a name means to you and how you could be in a party talking and talking and talking to somebody says your name 15 feet away and you're like and now you're listening to them or at the very fact that someone who's in a persistent vegetative state their brain will be stimulated to their name or that even child children under sedation can be stimulated by their name you could be sitting here with amnesia not have any idea who you are not even know what your relationship is what your inheritance is but then a prophet stands and says I'm not going to call you church I'll call you bride and somebody says whoa what was that somebody else is just over there going and you're like wait wait wait what what was that where'd that come from what did he say he had to identify the correct person in order to stimulate the bride to her feet had to get her attention she may not even known it she's shadowing something else she's shadowing this ministry she's shadowing this thing she's shadowing this hobby she's shadowing the world she's shadowing politics she's shadowing this but then one day a prophet says your name you're like wait a minute you may not understand it all at first but he had to say it in such a way to precisely identify the one that God had named in the sermon the breach he says the seals were broke why this is where we're bringing it to this bride uniting part in the last Church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride he opens the seals in order to collect his bride to gather his bride he wants to bring his subjects to him now what is it now this is a very broad statement that shows us that we're in this process at the opening of the word Out of the Dust of the earth out of the bottom of the sea out of the pits out of everywhere and every place out of the reasons of the dark out of paradise wherever they may be whether it be Paradise Valley whether it be over here whether it be over there doesn't matter where it may be wherever they may be he will call and they will answer he will call and they will answer he will come to get his subjects he revealed his secrets and they saw it do you see what this name calling is I hope you can see it as much more than just well when a name is called the name is called that has even has some uh some date on the calendar some particular moment it's been declared there's been a declaration made I I don't want to get into some of the statements from the sermon but let me just make reference to it the sermon the choosing of a bride brother Ram's not just re-preaching the election it's not just re-preaching predestination when he preaches choosing the variety he's not just preaching that there's always been an elect group in every age or there's always been a bride in every age that's not what he's preaching but he's actually preaching the choosing of a bride that God is now he's preaching a very specific dispensation he's placing the church as no longer church but as Bride As wife because it was the time and dispensation of the marriage so he uses a different language he even says bright age I'm going to call you bride so that maybe there'll be a deeper understanding what is it I'm using this phrase it's a name change why because the season changed brother Raymond the sermon the invisible Union of the bride of Christ I have this in a statement from the second seal we're going to close on and he says in the visible Union of the Bride of the of the bride of Christ he's talking about other days Wesley Luther Pentecost he said this is another day this is the open of the Seven Seals and he makes this acknowledgment I know it sounds strange to you but God has Vindicated it so perfectly there's no question on it just perfectly and then notice what he says I ain't scattering that to the local assembly here no offense Brother Moore right he said I'm not just saying this here but I'm speaking to people out Across the Nation who is he trying to his intention was he trying to catch do you do what you wish to notice the anointed word of this day of which you are a part by predestination you immediately like knew when you heard that the word in its season when you heard that the open of the seals when you heard that you knew right quick that you were an eagle do you realize what what this is the invisible Union of the bride of Christ why because he did the choosing now he does the u19. he identifies the season the chosen of a bride because now it's the time of the Union the wedding is taking place now the marriage is taking place now this is what you're enjoying right now is a union with your mate the revealed word and it has to do with your identity and he uses this story he says when you heard that you knew real quick that you were an eagle he's alluding to his story about the the the eagle who the the farmer had found the eagle egg and put it in the barnyard with the chickens and so the eagle was born with it with the chickens and so here he is where he lives is in a barnyard what he eats is what chickens eat where he sleeps is where chickens sleep everything about him is related to chickens and he might have just been called one of the chickens he might have been chicken number six hey and and here he is amongst all the chickens but there's something about the light that was on the inside of him that began to develop and to begin to grow because he had a different identity and I I know this has been related before but it's it it Bears just reminding ourselves of everyone in that barnyard the chickens never wanted the eagle to wake up like an endless Buffet hey so the chickens knew they all probably had these conversations look if he ever recognizes who he is right he's going to have us for breakfast lunch and dinner hey he's going to be it's going to be one of these keto diets he won't go around Chicken Scratch now he's not going to be eating the grain he's not going to be eating The Leftovers he's gonna be eating us and so they had there was a collusion and a meeting of Mines let's do everything we can to make sure that eagle always thinks it's a chicken you don't think the same conspiracies in place in today and laodicea you don't think the whole world is clamoring the way that it is because they just really don't want you to recognize who you are muddy everything up make everything confusing bully people cause fear of this fear of that why because they don't want you to recognize Who You Are we hear the phrase oh when the bride recognizes who she is do you realize then self-recognition how important it is how much your name has to do with self-recognition how much it has to do with identifying you and brother bear says when you heard that you knew right quick you were an eagle and how is the story related that the eagle flew over the Barnyard and screamed and and the story it's not a name right it's not it's not yelling out to Bow it's not yelling out to whatever the name might have been of that bird but it was an eagle scream it was an eagle cry and what was that just think about what it was it was the manifestation of a mature Eagle it was the manifestation of its origin where it came from it was a manifestation of its life it was a manifestation of its Destiny it was its origin it was its present state it was its Destiny all being revealed from the air all being revealed from the sky a declaration being made and when the eagle heard it he said that's me that's who I am that's my identity that's what I was called to be and that awakened it stimulated something in that Eagle's mind and the neurons begin to Fire and said that's who I am that's where I belong I don't belong here anymore the very Act of the message being declared is the calling of your name oh Hallelujah and then in the second seal brother Bradham again this is a theme that's quite extensive and he's praying I've thought of why don't people come and listen why don't they come and accept it but of course I know that you said they wouldn't so they won't but there's some that's got their names written on the Lamb's Book of Life hope you can catch this notice how detailed this is and when them seals are thrown open there they see their name there and the Holy Spirit speaks to them they come Hallelujah when the seals are open they see their name the Holy Spirit speaks them they come you can't keep them away I thought of why people don't come and listen why don't they come and accept it he goes but you said they wouldn't so they don't but there's some when the word is open they see their names just like John they see their names and the Holy Spirit speaks them and they come you can't keep them away no one can no one they're coming anyhow because you are leading them like you did those little birds and sheep in the cattle Thou Art God it's referring to how he saw it demonstrated there in the East and in India where the earthquake was coming and just prior to the earthquake all the cattle all the birds moved from the precarious places moved away from the wall he said that was God leading the nature away from those dangerous situations because the earthquake was coming and he says would God moved those little birds and sheep and the cattle he says they're coming anyhow because you're leading them how are we being led how are we being drawn forth he says the seals were opened and you see your name is that plain and he says they're coming not that they will come that means a book has been opened and your name is being called and that's what we're listening for is to hear our names not that it would be so precise that it would give my name and my address and how tall I am and the date I was born but something deeper than that something that has to do with self-recognition musicians if you'd please come will close with on this could we stand together
