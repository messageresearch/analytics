TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to say thank you to brother elizer for ministering Wednesday night that was just a tremendous service I I really loved it and my understanding was opened up is very encouraging uh some in my family voted it the best service of the year so I if I come across as a little competitive today you'll know why trying to win back my family but I thought it was just tremendous and I appreciate him being able to fill in especially uh uh you such a late notice I was wasn't recovering like I thought I'd be able to and I think it would have been my own Pride that would have uh compelled me to still show up and try to preach but I knew you deserve better so I'm just really appreciate the service and the leave that I was granted uh to recover Luke chapter 23 verses 26-33 some of you will find this to be very familiar um others if you're keeping up with the the series it might seem a little out of place but let's just read together and as they led him away they laid hold upon Simon irenan coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus so we realized now he's walking to Calvary and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewell and lamented him but Jesus turning unto them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in which they shall say blessed are the baren and the wombs that never bear and the paps which never gave suck then shall they begin to say to the mountain fall on us and to the hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall it be done in the dry and there were also two other malifa LED with him to be put to death and they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the malifa is one on the right hand and the other on the left amen if we could just pray again our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just ask that you'd settle our hearts and give us a Grace today to be able to receive your word father I pray that your anointing would be upon the hearer and Lord we know your word is Anointed we know that it is inspired father we know that the gift that you give uh that you've given to the church to minister father is your by your operation so Lord I just uh step my step aside and allow myself to be used for your glory that you might speak to your people so may you just reign supreme today in your word bless these things which we have read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be seated I'm just going to jump right into it today and trust that you'll be able to follow me and we'll go as far as uh just as we feel led or as far as uh my voice will allow but we want to continue on part nine of when the youngans don't grow up it's fitting into our series on the house of the Lord and I think the image is as a household and through marriage you have children and you raise them up and could you imagine in a home where the kids Never Grow Up move out and just how big of a house you'd need with grandchildren great-grandchildren and all the burden and responsibility it would be on maybe just uh the The Matriarch and the patriarch of the family and so there's just a lot of imagery there in this subject of when the youngans don't grow up and the image of a house you be in a house our household our family and then even this church one of the themes that we're looking at in these past several Services is uh from maybe this adolescence from childhood from to fullness and to maturity and it's pinpointing growing to a greater spiritual maturity you can't you can't grow your salvation but you can work it out you can't change your election but you can manifest it and you've been destined and that's uh that's something God's promised you and you you arrive at your destiny and so we are looking at becoming ripe as Believers and it speaks of being even I could say a Rapture Ready that there's a Readiness there's a condition at this end time that we've got to meet and we've been drawing heavily from the shareport series we'll call it that preached in November at the end of November 1965 it was Thanksgiving weekend and uh if you've been listening through this and you've been yourselves just going through these Services you'll find that there's just some tremendous thoughts that brother Bam's taking in total through those series uh series of services he preaches the invisible Union and faith is works or works as Faith expressed and trying to do God a service without it being his will and and I have heard but now I see God's provided place of worship and then he ministers on the wings of a snow white dove on that Sunday evening to cap it off such Rich uh things that he's laying out there he's getting these things out and then the very next sermon he preaches is here in Arizona the Rapture and so to me that's quite uh and then even the things beyond that it's quite a uh powerful series of messages that he's laying out to pinpoint the day and time that we're living in and one of the things he's identifying especially there in Port uh he's identifying that the Pentecostal church was in no condition to finish the last day message that there was God had done great works and he had been me emphasizing this through the several times he'd been there in the past that there had been a genuine move of God but now there's a Last Day message and he said the modern Church uh and he makes this statement when he's there preaching it's we've been drawing from this an invisible union he says the modern Church uh doesn't want any of these here scream shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around her uh she doesn't want it the modern Church doesn't want it and so brother bram's audience you could tell by the way he says that that the modern Church doesn't want any of these here and so he's identifying Life Tabernacle he's saying you guys you guys came up as real Pentecostals and you are you have the gifts in operation you believe in Divine Healing and you've done well and and so it's he's using Life Tabernacle as a rep representation of something he says the modern Church he's kind of being gracious to them he's saying the modern Church doesn't want any of these here youngans doesn't want this in their church and so he did wonderful to not question their experience and more importantly not take it away because he wanted them to go further he wanted them to take whatever God had done and go a little bit further and in Isaiah chap 28 we could read in verses 9 and 11 where it says for with stammering lips and other another tongue will he speak to this people the stammer lips that points to the youngans points to those that have been born it points to the day of Pentecost and the leod dean Church age represents the restoration of the gifts it represents a restoration back uh to those gifts that are poured out and to that move of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that there can be a full birth and it's so represents that in type and in restoration but the message identifies a different age and different time h brother Ram is very clear especially in the Rapture message and during this time period to say these things are true these things are right but we're living in a different time we're living in a maturing time we're living in a harvest time we're living in a ripening time and in The Invisible unit of the bride of Christ he says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering another age we're entering the Rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition and what was the condition he's ain't even Life Tabernacle where they are uh this Pentecostal move and Life Tabernacle to me represents something um significant because kind of that whole area is a real uh real strong uh move of God and outpouring to the Holy Ghost back in those days and their their own Jubilee and return to Pentecost and you'll even find that some of the most outstanding Pentecostal churches and some real stals and real powerhouse with even in UPC and the Pentecostal movement in that area so it's a real strong Pentecostal spirit that operates right around in that area and so brother brandham is identifying that the church in its present condition now it can't go and he says and it can't get any better it must get worse it's got to get worse it can't go like this so he says it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus saith the Lord and as he's not he's not saying anything else is wrong he's not tearing down any of the gifts he's not trying to uh squash put out their fire and he's not trying to become this identified with the modern church and this this cold formalism but he's saying now what God has done you youngans and what God has birth and what God has done it's time to go forward and move forward in the light because the bride's message the bride's commission it's not a movement it's not a repeat of a Pentecostal movement but it's a and it's not a repeat of the day of Pentecost or a pointing back and a restoration of the gifts but it is a rapturing time the move is on for the bride so she's moving she's going forward the light is advancing and so with samary lips and other tongues will I speak to this people but he says right there in verse n Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast that weekend in God's provided place of worship he's he's talking about the condition the condition of the church the church can't go in this condition and he says it takes a particular condition he says the the seed has got to be watered with the type of the water that that seed is made for so and he says it takes the right kind of condition so there's been these different conditions the heat of the sunlight same sunlight same Holy Spirit but there comes a dispensation and a time to ripen that grain to bring the seed to full manifestation and he's identifying this condition what what is the move what move is this the move is on for the bride the staming lips and another tongue have been poured out but who is he going to teach knowledge and make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast there's a change in dispensation a change in condition to be weaned is to be fully dealt with dealt with it means to ripen to be drawn from it's matured away from milk now entering into this real meat of the word of God in Hebrews chap 5: 11- 14 it identifies how Paul is saying you've become dull of hearing you're slow to understand and you're not able to handle the word of God skillfully and he says you've become babes because you've not grown grown to be able to handle meat and so they kind of got to go back and startle over again to get these things in place so Paul even in his age his gospel was about not just the things that were being placed in the church as far as gifts but the individuals themselves being placed and coming to perfection in Joel chapter 2 it speaks of the spirit of God being poured out upon All Flesh and this happens in the day of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit directs them to that word but in chapter three it says put ye in the sickle for the Harvest is ripe maturity must follow Perfection must be following this and it's a this is the process of life that where there's the seed and where the power of God's being poured out the the seed is germinated and it's quickened and it should come back to Perfection to fruit again and at the same time the Press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great false vines coming to maturity the false Church leod DEA is coming to its fullness of evil cup of iniquity coming full and then also at the same time the bride is becoming ripe in the presence of God so in the s report series I believe if you've been looking at it you'll find that brother brandom is pointing to Isaiah 2918 where the deaf ears are hearing the word of the book the blind eyes are seeing out of darkness and obscurity and the seals are being open Christ is being revealed so that in Isaiah 324 we can say the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge if there are understanding knowledge it means they've matured they've been weaned they've drawn away from uh just milk but they're going to understand and knowledge and the tongue of the stammer shall be ready to speak plainly there is a scriptural dispensation it's absolutely scriptural the speaking in tongues and the gifts and the move of God God doesn't take that away from the church but that very experience within the church will take individually individuals to this place of maturity to speak plainly so this growing up is the process of perfection it's a process of learning applying what you've learned it's process of obedience and suffering and today I want to ident I want to remind you that that's difficult that's not an easy process when we earlier this year when we were ministering on why houses fall we're talking about taking shortcuts and the man who worked hard to lay the proper Foundation his house stood and how it's easy you could take shortcuts or go the easy route and it was a difference between one that was wise and one that was foolish and didn't really want to put in the hard work just wanted to the easy way it's the principle of least effort that I believe all humans find themselves wrestling with where people just naturally choose whatever path they experience the least resistance it's why some people say it's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is for permission and so you just kind of follow the easy way the easiest path but Christians are not looking for something easy a a and if you are looking for something easy I'm reminding you that you don't you shouldn't be looking for something easy as a Christian because it is easy to go with the flow it's easy to go with nature of the world and the course of this world it's easy to kind of get caught up in these things and it's in doing that and getting caught up in it that you come under its influence but brother B said it's hard it's not hard to stand up and keep true to a Creed think at that it's not hard to keep true to a Creed he says it's easy for the devil's right behind all of that if it's a Creed it's easy to stand up for it if it's a Creed if the devil's behind it he makes it easy but it's something else to be true to God's word and go back to what the the word originally produced after Pentecost so it's easier just to accept a Creed it's easier just to make things traditional but it's hard to stand for God's true word and come back to the word that was originally produced after after Pentecost and there's a lot more that I was hoping to minister on this particular series but I've just been trying to draw out uh some very specific points and in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ one thing that stood out to me time when I was going through it is how that his the focus his focus is on the fruit or the children of a union and the life that follows the seed that is that that Union has brought forth and it's not so much on the marriage aspect though that's there but he's saying that in a marriage in this Union between a man and a woman it produces children and he's saying the modern Church doesn't want the these kind of young ons because it doesn't it it it doesn't believe in those things this modern Church cannot produce children of God and that's one of the themes so he's looking at the fruit of a union and how that the character of a genuine birth is identified by receiving the word by obeying the word and by the fruit that is born through the union of the Holy Ghost with an individual soul and not only can the modern church not bring forth children of God it cannot also follow the word I think this is something that's important to catch is that not only can it not bring forth children of God but whatever children it brings forth ultimately cannot go all the way in the word because they're still producing something now in this sermon invisible Union brother brandham uses this scripture in Luke chapter 23 and verses 28-31 and I think this is a very important reference and it it's placed right there in the middle of the sermon it's maybe seems to come out of a little bit of a of the blue but he says Jesus turning to them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bear and the paps which never gave suck so it's saying blessed are those that don't have children to worry about then shall they begin to say to the mountains Fallen us and the hills cover us brother man quotes this and says speaking of the day that when women would no more want children and what a remarkable uh direct implication that Christ is making that there come a day when women won't want children because of the conditions of the age because of the condition of society uh because of their own uh thinking and their thoughts they will no longer want children but since it's in them to Mother they'll bring forth something or have something to mother and so he's uses this scripture of blessed is the women that are Barren or don't have children speaking of a time and a condition that he's identifying now this day where in women don't want children and in verse 31 says for they do for if they do these things this such a remarkable statement for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry if they'll do these things to the Green Tree a green tree which to the Jews was an image of a good man or something good what shall be done in the dry tree so they'll do this to a green tree that seems to have life in it what would they do to a dry tree that doesn't have life we know that this green tree is a representation of Christ it's a living tree Jesus says in John 12: 24 except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so Christ is this green tree and he has been cut down and he has been crucified and they're they're persecuting and destroying this green tree but there is a promise that if this seed go goes into the ground uh it'll bring forth much fruit other trees like him the firstborn among many Brethren so Christ is represented in this green tree we know there's a purpose to this tree uh these things being done to the green tree but the dry tree stands opposite to this and this dried tree in the Easter SE brother BR is referring to it as the old dead formal tree you have the Green Tree Christ but then you have a tree which is dead which is formal which is dried up and he uses this scripture in Luke chap 23 verses 28-31 and this last verse for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry he uses this scripture right before he starts saying the screaming shouting tongu speaking acts 238 youngans and it's the last scripture he uses before he goes on this very long stretch of identifying this attitude within the modern Church to not want children and and this youthfulness and this exuberance that takes place within the experience of a child of God so what it does to me Scriptures it brings into view the purpose of a tree and what a tree is made for and how you can have these two different conditions and stages of a tree he says a green tree and if they'll do this to a green tree maybe a young tree and what would they do to a dry tree Green Tree when he refers to this and when brother bandam is identifying these shouting screaming jubilant excitable blabbering uh uh acts 238 youngans he's describing the green they're young they're full of life they have energy and there's an enthusiasm did you know that there's an enthusiasm when one has a genuine experience with the Lord and these are characteristic of a birth when something's born it has life in it if it's still born there's no life there's no there's nothing there to make an announcement and brother brandham in the sermon influence says when they were filled with the Holy Spirit speaking about the day of Pentecost they went into action right quick out into the streets and screaming and dancing and acting like drunk people speaking in other tongues and what a carryon they were in action right quick as soon as they humbled themselves went in closed the door and waited on the word of the Lord this is what happens when the Holy Ghost comes in there's an enthusiasm there there's a life there's an energy I believe that's one of the things uh that stood out to me in my experience is there was a different energy a different life a different enthusiasm one thing that to me that's a real Mark of a genuine experience is someone's appetite for the word of God and how excited they get about the things of God brother brandom in the sermon thirst very near here to the shrif port series it was in September 65 he says are you enthused with your experience in Christ why because you ought to be are you enthused about it well if you're not maybe you need to think about it brother Bram said when you're born there's an enthusiasm Rises with that birth and sets the soul of fire so a green tree is a tree with life in it there there there's some animation there there's desire there's movement a and there's a new life there and that comes with the experience and I believe it's it we we remind you of that and that brother Brandon went to Great Links to remind us because there could be this misconception that you just shake the preacher's hand you just put your name on a roll uh you just light a candle and you believe that you're saved and there's real there's no change in nature there's no change in desire there's been no genuine definite experience with the Holy Ghost and so with a definite experience of the Holy Ghost it can work its way in different people and different measures but what should follow is an enthusiasm and so this is a tree with life in it and as I was thinking about this scripture green tree and uh if this happens to a green tree and what happens in a dry tree now brother brandom is using this scriptural image right before he begins to talk about what the modern Church doesn't want to bring forth that that woman is a tree and if she doesn't want to bring forth children then she's a tree that's going to be Barren but then there's going to be a tree that puts forth babes puts forth children and in the sermon how can I overcome brother R is giving the intro to how he came up with that sermon he said he jumped on this log was this old sturdy what looked like a big old beach log and he jumped on it and he said it fell apart really quick he said that's the that's how the Christian church is becoming and he said they can't hold weight and they don't know what overcoming means he said this is how I got my text overcome keep life in you this is what overcome is to keep life in you you have a green tree with life then you have a dried tree something happened to that life when life went out that's what brought the log to that condition so he says kind of at the end of this inro he says so strive to keep so strive with all that's in you to stay in the Life of Christ that you'd be fruit bearing notice how he brings it to that conclusion that this overcoming then I'll say it this way overcoming is being fruitful that to keep life in you is not just to remain maybe I'm giving it away now it's not just to remain green but as a tree with life in you if you can keep life in you you can bring forth fruit so it's the process as long as life can work freely within the tree then it'll produce the fruits of what that tree is destined to produce it'll come back to seed again and identify what kind of tree that it is and so there's a green tree and brother R I'm saying this tree at one time would strong and sturdy but it fell over and it died right there in the branch the water that could have given it life caused it to rot twice as quick so over overcome is to keep life in you and if overcoming is to keep life it's not just to be uh vivacious and energetic but for that energy that's in you to produce fruit now we have a Dy tree the Green Tree I there's so many scriptures we could use in the book of Acts and in the New Testament how the the green tree has life in it brother man even talks about the tree that the leaves the Clapping of hands that repres represents the gifts and those things and so there's a there's a tree that comes to leaves and it has a certain life working in it but the dried tree if they'll do this to a green tree what shall be done in the dry the dry tree is the condition of a tree that is dead or dying it's not fruitful anymore so it's not serving its purpose and saying if they'll do this to a green tree that has life and can fulfill the purpose what are they going to do to a dry tree that's no longer meeting its purpose but let me say this if they'll do this to a green tree what will be done in the dry but you know the tree wasn't born dry you don't plant uh seeds and the tree come up as a dry tree but old dry trees are trees that didn't mature the right way or if I could say it this way they didn't mature they just aged a green tree is a particular tree a Dy tree is a tree that did not mature it just aged they did not mature and we could tell that it did not mature by the fruits that they have because the the the fruits tell you that it didn't mature correctly it aged it's planted years ago but we've come to this season in time where the tree is obviously old but it never matured correctly because it's not producing fruit and so the fruits tell you that it didn't mature correctly because you don't destroy a good tree you'll burn a dry tree you'll cut chop down an unfruitful tree but you don't chop down a useful tree many of you will be familiar with this story that brother Braham told many many times he told the told the story of green trees and dead trees anybody familiar with that brother man talking about the old Big Trees the pine trees that were groaning and moaning and then the young trees they're right there in the same forest and he was in the woods on the Alaskan border He said Out hundreds of miles away from even a main road or something and he said he looked out over to this Forest that had been burned over and there had been a fire that went through there and he describes in these several different places these old stately strong trees old stately large but he said they were dead and they were dry be yet the wind be to blow through that Valley and blow through the woods and when the wind blew through he said those dry trees begin to moan and squeak and squawk he called it groaning and the wind's moving them and they making a sound but he said that they just kind of had this gloominess to him these are my words but he's like oh cranky and old and moaning and groaning but then underneath all the complaining and this grumbling he saw new trees growing and to him that kind of it identified this great difference of how these old stately trees had grown up to this place where now they're dead and they don't have life in them and so when the spirit of God moves they just complain and they grow and they're stiff and they're starchy but and it's kind of like oh what a shame but then he begin to look oh but there's a new trees coming up and listen to how he begins to describe these trees I've tried to read every single place place that he tells this story and pull out to understand this full complete picture and he says young trees that were coming up they were flexible they just give to the wind Frolic back and forth like this having a good time young trees just coming up when the wind blew oh they were flexible they just frolicked he said in another place they were twisting and ringing and shouting and having a glorious time then little trees begin to frolic and jump and dance and carry on the winds blew through them and they'd Frolic With the Wind I'm reading from many different sermons they were just flexible and jumping and rejoicing shouting having an old Holy Ghost meeting why they were flexible they had life they were moving with the wind just rejoicing they weren't moaning about it they were rejoicing frolicking jumping having an oldtime Revival sounds like a holy ghost meeting and he says he quotes the tree in one place I'm as green a gourd but I can sure give to the wind when God sends the wind I like Frolic with it let them say you're crazy I don't care just green enough to frolic With the Wind talking about the wind hitting those old trees he says but when it hit them little green trees that's got life in it it just frolics and jumps up and down an oldfashioned Holy Ghost Revival and he said the wind the influence he said one make made them moan and the same one that made them moan gave the others Frolic that's interesting isn't it the one that made the trees frolic the wind that made them Frolic same wind that made the others groan now when looking at this picture I want you I I hope that we've already set up who these green trees are they have life in them they're enthused they're coming up there's these young trees he says young green these are two outstanding characters he says over and over again about being green and being flexible being young and he said that this these trees that were young and green and flexible when the wind would move they would Frolic they dance they shout they move around real good but he says as each time that happens those roots get stronger and stronger and stronger and deeper and deeper so there's an unseen impact that's happening on these young green trees as the wind moves and they respond to the Holy Spirit and they Frolic they're getting stronger maybe getting more stately because these fried trees weren't always dry but brother bam begins to describe them and how that they became starchy they became formal they became critical they they they were the old cranky Fighters the old critics and because they weren't the one frolicking and because they weren't the ones with the hands and they weren't the ones with the gifts you know they complained if they weren't the one that called the prayer line oh well we don't believe in such a thing if they're not the ones preaching and the altars are full ah we don't believe in altar calls right they they want the glory they're the old cranky Pentecostal Fighters but this is the danger those old trees were young ones those old trees were green ones so you better grow up correctly or you better grow up or you'll lose life you better mature correctly or you'll lose something brother M talks about a cornstock that grows and and I say this there's nothing wrong with the word and there may be nothing wrong with the grass but that seed is sewn and the light begins to come up he said if something lays across that corn stock it'll change the way that it's growing up still corn still growing but something inhibits its growth and causes it to Veer or be a little bit deformed and it won't grow up straight because of an outside influence and I'm saying this to those who are seed and there's good ground there's a way that the world and the church and religion and things want to influence your growth so that you don't grow up you may age but you won't grow up so think with me on this think about the the the frolicking green trees and that's the beginning of something and then you look and see the end and it's dry it's going to be burned it's dead it's groaning it's unfruitful and I'm not necessarily trying to create two categories of where you end up but to see this process working where there's life brother Bram in the sermon we would see Jesus says when a man is converted his eyes are set towards Calvary and and I believe he's speaking of a genuine conversion and even what it takes to be genuinely converted but he says if he's just a little bit nervous if you don't watch him he'll go over on the fanatic side so let's just look at it this way that you have a a person who's Born Again they're converted so now they become new creatures in Christ he says if he doesn't watch it if he already has some other predisposition some other kind of nature that he's predisposed to if he's kind a little bit more nervous and more emotional and those things he ends up on the fanatic side if he's just a little scholarly he'll go over on the starchy side so the condition even of the individual and what he's predisposed to if he's not careful he'll begin to lean to one of these sides even after his experience lean either to a fanatic side or a starchy side but right in the middle of the road is the same sensible Born Again spirit LED endowed Church of the Living God going straight down the road to Christ that's the real coming from both the sides one went away and one went the other shows fanaticism or either scholarly and too stiff to Bow so there's a middle of the road that we're to be coming into the image of Christ and that the Holy Spirit should be operating in us to come to that place in Christ's image Christ being formed in us growing up into him which is the head in all things but you got to watch out out because if you had some kind of bent before you might tend to lean to the more the fanatic side or you might tend to lean to the more starchy scholarly side so you can have a nervous side you can have a starchy side brother br's not saying well the nervous have really got it they've got the Wildfire they must really have it and the starchy they're just Catholics and they're dead he's saying no you got to be careful because both of those ways lead out this way but you've got to come right down and Cal from both sides into Christ he says the star you know more about the word than they know about the author to know the word's not life but to know him to know him is life to know him you don't have to be a scholar you have to be a submitted person to be nervous you don't have to you can know all the word you can in the letter of it but you still be a nervous person and just because you're nervous and exercise a certain way and look a certain way doesn't mean you've got them but either side you've got to be a submitted person that's what it takes is to be a submitted person brother man says when you submit yourself to Christ Christ is obligated to feel that vacancy I love that even in the sense that as he's possessed your soul continue to yield and he's pushing out pushing out Christ is having preeminence that you've poured your out on the altar he's obligated to his word to do it and he will not fail you am he who has begun a good work will finish it will mature it will perfect it right so there's this tendency and these two sides es that can begin to work even in a genuine person brother BR saying wow I'm not going to say either one of them or wrong uh you can have your impersonations of that but you got to stay in the middle of the road to Christ and the sermon God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same this is not coffee this is a tea for my my throat you say well you know it's bad when the preacher has to drink coffee to stay awake he said the Methodist said when we shouted we had it but they didn't the nazarin said they lived holy they had it but they didn't the Pentecostal said we speak in tongues we got it but they didn't God unfolded himself not in Sensations not going to have time to get to it today I don't think but we'll get to it uh maybe uh uh in a future sermon he says not in Sensations remember one of the Mysteries in this last day is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but it's the person of Christ working in you doing the works of Christ so he says not in Sensations no Sensations yet with it so it's not the evidence he says but yet I mean how can how can the power of God be present and even The Unborn again and unregenerate not feel it and know something's happening when God can move on such a level so there is a human stimulus response to it but he's saying God unfolds himself not in the sensation he says you see the place he just gets it so humble till anybody can see it if you inject your own mind to it in your own thoughts he says it's God but there's this a danger of injecting your own mind your own thoughts he said and then they become a bunch of Fanatics then here's the cold formals on this side and here's the Fanatics on the other side ah there's your two sides there's your nervous one that becomes a fanatic and your scholarly one that becomes starchy and he says the the god moves and God moves in such a way but then they inject their own thoughts into it what do they end up doing they end up going to either side and here goes the bride right straight through it all calling from both sides that's just God vindicating as he goes along his word so the bride she's got to stay in the middle she's got to be going straight towards Christ and as she goes straight towards Christ she's saying this is the way walk in it she's calling from both sides to the middle of the road listen if the fanatic tries to pull on the scholarly if the nervous person pulls on the scholarly guess where the scholarly ends up in a ditch with the fanatic and then the scholarly begins to pull on the nervous person and they just jerk them right across the road into the ditch on the other side but the bride's the only one in the middle who can stay balanced straight towards Christ and call from both sides and because she's in the middle the Fanatics don't like her and neither do the scholarly right right she takes shots from both sides cuz she's in the middle and they think they're shooting at each other but all they're doing is trying ultimately attacking the bride so with these injection of One's Own thoughts and you can either be a fanatic or you can be a formal it gives rise to these two different sides where there's the easy emotionalism and the easy believism it's easy to be emotional easy to work yourself up it's easy to cry it's easy to get excited it's easy to do these things especially for those who find that they're already predisposed to that and there's an easy emotionalism and an easy belief ISM and if it's easy the devil's behind it even though we realize yet sensation with it and if it's not if there's no emotion it's dead and bury it but yet there can be an easy emotionalism where the very fact that it's emotional is used to somehow make you feel like you've got it when that's not it and the same could be instead of easy believism even though the Bible tells us only believe and that we ought to believe and it's the only thing you can do but yet that kind of believing doesn't produce Easy Living it doesn't make it easy but yet the devil will use it to pervert it but right down in the middle of the road is the harder way and here's Christ saying if they do these things to a green tree what will they do to a dry in the very next picture it says he's going to be hung between two malifa there's Christ Christ the green tree right in the middle and then on each side is one that rejects him but the other all he says is this day be with me and he's in Paradise he's there saying uh rebuking and say remember me when you when you go and he says this day you'll be with me in paradise and yet right there the one that's going to be judged and the one that receives Grace there's Christ right in the middle Christ The Green Tree lifted up on a tree showing us that right down the middle of the road is calling from both sides calling out of the the the those that truly are word rejectors or those that are sinners and those that don't want to have anything to do and then maybe those that might think they could just take the last minute easy way out there's Christ right down in the middle of the road the harder way to continue on this image of the these trees in John 15: 1 to8 Jesus says I am the vine excuse me I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman now what does that tell us the image of Christ being a Vine that is growing and God is the one that's the pruner yes he's the one that's watching out over and making sure the vine is growing up properly so the father to the son is watching out over the growth and development of the Sun so that the vine can produce the fruits that the father intended when he planted the seed every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away notice there are branches then in this Vine he says if it's not fruitful it's taken away I I read this scripture to point out that if we must grow correctly we must mature not just age but mature because if we don't mature in the image of the dead tree or the dry tree you lose life but now we can see that you lose something and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit so the fruits are wonderful but if he sees the fruit then the father chastised he corrects he instructs he teaches so it can be more fruitful now you clean through the word which I've spoken unto you there's a cleansing there's a sanctification there's a word of God that does this and the father wants to work these things so he says abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye because the vine furnishes energy to the branches so you cannot be fruitful except ye abide in me so there has to be an abiding there has to be this connection I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit not just fruit but much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he's cast forth as a branch and is withered so whether there's a lack of abiding something happens to that Branch where it's not fruitful and so it is taken away it Withers it dies it's dry and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me in my words AB in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you here in is my father glorified how is the husbandman glorified how is it that the husband the dresser of the vineyard the one that owns it how is he going to be glorified when The Vineyard fruits and grows up when a man plants seed he says yeah I got 160,000 Acres of cotton out there and he look like uh I just see a field sir he like yeah but I planted the SE and nobody's like right said we'll find out come Harvest Time and then you see hundreds of thousands of Acres of cotton you're like wow that guy's a farmer man he's done something so herein is my father the husband glorified to be glorified means to render illustrous to make Renown to cause the dignity and worth of a person to be made manifest what is it that glorifies God what is it that going to make him Renown when what he's planted produces what it's intended to produce here in is the father glorified here in is the husbandman Vindicated that you bear much fruit amen so you may be my disciples it is in the bearing of fruit that the husbandman the dresser The Vineyard The Keeper of the garden the one that prunes the one that purges the one that has the vision it's therein that he glorified as he was the vine and the father was the branch or he was the vine and the father the husband think about the works that Jesus did the wonderful works of God that were to be made manifest and as Christ bore the fruit of an obedient son he says so shall you be my disciples his disciples will learn and be obedient likewise and in doing so they will bear much fruit brother brand I'm even looking at this scripture says we have life we live the life we live the life that he would live if he was here on Earth in in physical form it's a life that we're living and the sermon be not afraid he says now if you want to say I got the Holy Ghost standing on my head he says amen go on I don't care what you got you say I got a I seen a big light go ahead and see the big light amen if you live the life I believe you got it you say I got it speaking in tongues amen if you live the life I believe you got it if you don't live the life you didn't get it that's all you've got to have that life behind there by their fruit you shall know them it's the entirety of the life that vindicates and proves what's in the seed do you realize there's different stages of a tree where it might look just like another tree even to the bark in the branches and the leaves but it's not until it produces its Acorn and produces its seed that you know the difference between another and if that's the wrong type that then then that's the wrong type but the truth is the vine the false Vine wraps itself around entangles it around and it looks just like the True Vine but what it can't produce is that word it can impersonate all sorts of physical big lights standing on the head speaking in tongues it can even do many wonderful Works in his name but what it can't produce is the entirety of the life cannot impersonate that word amen so Jesus says in verse 16 of that chap chapter you've not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you that you should go that's what brother BR says oh you got to stand on your head go on you saw a big light hey you saw a big light go on you spoke in tongues you shouted you danced you cried go on you've been chosen great I've ordained you then go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain not just that you have fruit not that you're just young and green at one point and then end up old starchy stale but that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask of the father in my name remember the name is not just the Lord Jesus Christ but it's character it's nature it's the will whatsoever you asking my nature my character my name he may give it to you why would he do it because it's in the nature it's in the character power apart from characters without is say anic but here you have a son a daughter growing and that your fruit should remain it's fruit that last fruit that comes to Perfection brother B in the sermon if God be with us then where are all the Miracles he says we've Twisted the word to make it this way and twisted the word to make it that way and twisted it some other way to make it fit a plan just like as I'm speaking out just like injecting your mind into something your mind and your experience and and getting out on these other sides he says but the time has come to Halt stop your pling church the time has come when people say if you can't if you can just get enough Spirit to dance in the spirit if you can just get enough to see lights before your eyes or a sensation to run down your back or some quiver some shake some emotion you've got it he says you've got something but I wouldn't say just what you had till I seen what kind of fruit it grew remember how he said that's what happens with the the little the babies they want to feel something they want to feel some sensation and he says well and I guess I'll put it this way even in this sense he's saying well yeah you got something and you cry and you dance you see lights you have a sensation runs up and down your back well I won't speak against that but what kind of fruit do you grow and notice again let's just be real let's think about what he's saying then if he's saying I still want to see fruit what he's saying is all that other stuff isn't the fruit it's not the fruit of the tree it's the actions of a tree it's what a tree will do when the wind blows but only life only life working properly in the tree can bring that fruit you listening even the old dead trees groaned and moan you say oh the old stately dead trees groaned within themselves for the adoption the Redemption of the body growing all trees just groing to be changed in a moment the twink of an ey like that'll preach but the the the thing that was missing was what a tree should be at that stage the tree brother says the fruit comes at the top not on the leaves in this restoration this bride tree age with this Union with the invisible bridegroom it's to fruit it's to bring forth fruit and the fruits not the leaves it's not the shouting it's not the dancing it's not the bark it's not the tongue it's not all these other physical things that a tree will do when the wind hits it and the external forces hit it but it's when it produces the word again he said I wouldn't say what you had till I seen what kind of fruit it grew and we went through it this morning so that morning on that uh New Year Eve in 61 he says you can't expect a baby to be born a man it has to grow to it and we grow into the stature into Christ the full stature now somebody get converted tonight and tomorrow go preach the gospel why because generally when his conversion if he was scarly and he gets converted then he might end up being a little bit more starch and formal if he's converted and he's more nervous and might become a little bit more fanatic so what God wants to do is work on that gift and that person to call him away from these other uh predisposed things he might have and these things in his mind and his spirit and his garden and train them and discipline them and fill up these VES as he yields himself and he submits himself so he can be fully used of God in these gifts says we grow up into manhood into the stature of Christ the very image of the the seed that's swn on those different stages of ground in Luke CH 8:8 and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a h hundredfold one place he says some 40 60 80 100 but hundredfold means this to be hundredfold it means it's 100y right the maximum increase that a seed can bring forth if one was to bring up so much and say well that there was a potential there but it didn't bring all of it but to be hundredfold is full measure the entitiy of the life full manifestation fell on good ground and it bear the maximum yield that it was able to Bear to bring forth a h hundredfold takes yielding takes submission to the husbandman to the father takes purging chastisement takes working and dressing takes a little bit of dunging Luke chap 13 6-9 He spake also this Parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none why did he plant the tree so that it could wiggle in the wind no he wanted fruit he came and sought fruit there and found none then said he went under the dress of the vineyard behold these three years I've come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cth it the ground it's a burden to the ground it's a burden to the soil it's a burden to the nutrients it's a burden to the light it's a burden to the water all these things I do to it to try to make it fruitful it's not making it fruitful so it loses something but then this very moment this keeper The Vineyard the answering and said him Lord let it alone this year till I shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down I Believe In This Very thing we can see the image of brother brandom at this very dark time when the church is blacked out and Christ has been kicked out of the church here stands one preaching a lifetime e go run for your life come back to Christ just once more and he's laying in the word he preaches these things he's saying oh God be merciful oh just give another year give another time give another this it's r rapure season it's Rapture time this is when fruit should be coming forth but just wait Lord let this word let's dig about it let's dun it up so that it can become fruitful and then after this time has passed then those that aren't fruitful cut them down burn them but take the rest in your Garner it's the image of a tree doing exactly what it's supposed to do brother BR I'm writing in the church age book chapter 9 on Leo DEA says the choosing will be his own choosing I've chosen you I've ordained you that you bring forth much fruit that your fruit should remain his choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk those born by the spirit go on the move is on the Green Grow the life moves on and in this living after your day of Pentecost is a training to be conformed to His Image in your walk and let me say this as we try to wind this around down to a close young trees May Frolic but trees are made to fruit not just Frolic you're made for that you have the life in you young green trees are flexible that's why I think it's beautiful in the Youth of one's experience how they can adapt and they can move the Holy Spirit and they believe for great things and in time you don't want to get jaded or you don't want to get starchy you don't want to get stiff and rigid but you're not just made to frolic you're made to fruit you don't want to just blow off a bunch of steam but you want to channle that energy amen Ecclesiastes 3:1 says there's a in everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven There is a time to cry there is a time to dance there is a time to plant but then there's also a time to harvest in other words the order of things there's a time to plant it's a time to water there's a time to frolic there's a time to grow and then eventually there comes a harvest and in that time you're not going back to planting again you're not going back to watering again necessarily it's everything that's been done in you is a part of you to that moment for the Harvest brother bam says this about his about brother Billy Paul he's given a trip report having gone to Africa he's talking about Billy Paul and he says that gift is laying so close to him if you just move over into it it would be wonderful I want you to catch this young trees May Frolic but trees aren't made to frolic they're made to fruit when that tree that the dresser of the vineyard the or the husbandman the father of the vineyard the owner of the vineyard said he planted a Vineyard and he came and he saw the Fig Tree and he said it doesn't have any fruit and then the one who dressed The Vineyard The Keeper of the ground he doesn't say oh wait till the Windstorm you'll love it it's not what he says it's fruit that he's looking for brother Bram said about Bly Paul but he's just at that Frolic age you know adolescence you know what I mean here was a gift lay there that could be extraordinary that he had to move into it but he was at the Frolic age this adolescence this youthful Sage he says I pray that God will settle him down someday put him on a platform to give him a Ministry just bring millions of souls to Christ he says I I do you pray for him too and this is brother Brandon talking about his son he says he's got a lot up front but I know what Billy is in the back here's a father here's a Daddy who knew what was in his son knew the potential knew the possibility but saw just a lot of Frolic but knew that God had to work on him to bring him from Frolic to settle him to get him to the place reak Abus used of God as Believers when we're saying when youngans don't grow up and we'll have maybe one more service on this subject to get in the very these aspects of failure to grow up and what happens if we just age and not mature but we must mature not just age we should neither be starchy or just fanatical but grow up strong and fruitful and I want you to consider this and think a lot about this that maturity is as we mature in Christ you're relying Less on the physical evidence and the physical sensation but moving more in faith that's real maturity that's grounded so when you're not just always responding to stuff brother bam is he poses this hypothetical talking about these stages he said if we could break it up into these different quarters it could be the first 25 years second 25 years third 25 years or the fourth last 25 years he said you know which one would you choose he said I would choose the last if I could live if I could choose to live God told you beforehand when you live he said you're going to be a carpenter if you're going to be a runner if you're going to be a jumper if you're going to be a daath athlete you're going to be in the Olympics you're going to build something he says then choose the second 25 he said but I I would choose the last 25 as a Christian that 75 to 100 years he says even as a Ministry I say I I choose that last he says because of knowledge the accumulation of knowledge he said I was thinking about what about me what will I take I'd take 75 to 100 I'd be smarter wiser I'd be more settled I'd know more about what I'm doing I'm 10 or eight years older the last time I was overseas now notice this to me the continuity with this Africa trip report last time he was there he's talking about Billy Paul when he comes back he gives a report he said ah he's in that Frolic age I just pray that God would settle him down and he's identifies this in brother Billy Paul that he's got a great gift if he could move into it God he's just in this Fric adolescence God just needs to settle him down 10 years later he says if I was I would be more settled now he said I'd be more s in my last 100 or last 25 years he says when I went there 10 years ago he said I was when I was overseas he said I won't be jumping in like I'm killing snakes W interesting Billy Paul needed to grow up now brother BR saying you know what if I could go back to Africa my last 25 years I I'd be more settled than I was then jumping in like I'm killing snakes well I could just imagine what that would look like how does one kill a snake come here bite it no it's i' know more about it see I know how just like a dog fighting a you know about how to take a hold of him don't jump in there scratch you up know his tricks and watch what he does and we learn more about the enemy so we got to find out all his techniques and how he approaches and what he does and learn his punches then you're trained to go down into him so I believe now I told the wife I believe I'm in better shape now than I was when I was 40 years old and went over to Africa and I'm 54 but I believe if I live and can still get around as good as I can now when I'm a hundred if Jesus would carry that long I'd be in better shape than I am now to go because you'd know more about it you'd know more about what to do and how to handle it how to handle the situation be more stable wouldn't be jumping to everything wouldn't be just moved by things boy the devil tries to do it so often just to get you to move brother bramman the sermon works as Faith Express this is November 26 this the day after he preaches about these youngans these young green trees coming up with life he says sometimes we misunderstand this people gets emotion and they try to work on emotion that won't work please pay attention this now I'm like brother gerholz are here we're old men and we've been in this a long time and we've seen the pros and cons and everything and praying for the sick around the world and seeing the disappointment of people and seeing the Hallelujah from every side then all this we learn by now when as boys we started preaching this Brother G holer like we started to swim first thing you know it used to be that I'd get out and brother Jack I'd have brother Brown to walk me on the street night after night to try to get myself around to myself I'd stand there like a little kid splashing the water seeing visions you know it's working things are happening but he says he Splash in the water I remember one night I'll never forget it up in San Jose or somewhere he come to wake me up I hadn't slept for several days I didn't know I was talking to the man but I said that I told him I started crying I'm going home why he said you can't go home there's a meeting going on down there I said well I'll I'll be ready for a few minutes to go home just beside myself almost I was a boy then I think about this maturing this growing was brother brandom any less used of God then was it not God it was God said I was a boy then I was wearing myself out he says it's like learning to swim and and my when my kids learned to swim uh Jack is the fastest one-armed swimmer I've ever seen in my life he used his one arm to swim across the pool and I tell him son if you could learn to do that with both arms you'd be another Michael Phelps go Blue he said like you're learning to swim you know you splash the water and go across the pool and I made her right you ever seen it I made it I made it I made it I made it I made it now after you learn to swim more graceful the stroke and it don't wear you out so much that's it you learn how to do it and you cut every corner and make it better and that's more of an ease now don't misread that he's not saying it's easy to get there it's hard to learn how to do it right takes discipline it takes training it takes time to learn this is how you do it this is the right way to do it and the harder the more work you put in the beginning the easier it is to do it right in the end little boy that never walked would try to walk down this aisle here he'd fall down a dozen times and be wore out before he got there but any one knows how to walk an athlete would walk down the aisle and never even notice doing it well he had that to start with that's what he is now he had that to start with the little boy that stumbles over the aisle he's got the athlete in him he's got the capacity in him but he needs to learn well that's the same way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn if you don't learn there's something wrong you've got to learn you got to learn how to accept God and what it really means not just some young loyal you're screaming and shouting and making a big fuss and making the people cry he said but but the word lay the word stayed in the word an old veteran who knows how to handle it and he says this in the very this very serious he's saying it's like learning how to swim you can Splash a lot of water out of the pool and you can make it to the other side but you need to learn how to do it right in second Peter chapter 1 Peter gives what we know to be the statue of a perfect man and the adding of Faith all the way to the Capstone which is charity and brother Bram says add add add he says you don't add nothing it's the Holy Spirit working in you from that Foundation of Faith to those who've already had this blessed experience all the potential all the gift he said that when the one he had he had it to start with that's what he is now you had it in you to begin with it's in you all these virtues all these uh abilities all this fruit is in you to begin with it's just got to be placed to come out into its full Perfection so Peter says in 2 Peter 1 verse 8 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus in you and abound they'll make you fruitful make you Bountiful bring forth much fruit and your fruit would remain in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ brother R in the sermon show us the father says something has brought forth a church that believes God is the Living God and when God sends that rushing Pentecostal wind down they just Sway and Frolic in it you say they're green but they're having a good time and they're growing if they're green they've got life if you're not a little bit green you don't have any life but notice what he says they're green they're having a good time and they're growing if it has life it can grow if it abides in the vine it'll bring forth much fruit if these things be in you and abound it'll make you neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ it may make you stand on your head it may make you shout it may make you see a big light it may make you do all these other things but that's not the fruit he's talking about that's not the evidence he's talking about he's talking about coming into the very image and growing up first John 2:6 he that say he that saith he abideth in him this is coming right back to John 15 if you abide in me the works that I do shall you do also and greater than this shall you do he said that there's a if you abide in the vine you're going to work out these things you're going to be fruitful if he says he abides in him he ought to walk as he walked he that sayith he abide in him ought himself also to walk even as he walk if not he either becomes fanatical or he becomes starchy but either way he's not fruitful you catch that and not the start you can say well we've got we've got the doctrine down and we've got the fundamentals down and we've got the scholarship down and the Fanatics going ah well we got the gifts and we got this and we got that and what is it we've got Spirit yes we do we got Spirit how about your we've got the word yes we do we got the word how about you uh just back and forth I don't know if they do this anymore at high school football games uh but there's that's that's all they're doing and meanwhile the brides in the field winning the battle and the cheerleaders over there there's PW poms you know the rides going right down the middle of the road as Christ learned he grew therefore we must grow from green trees to fruitful trees because if you don't grow you'll get dry brother brownman the greatest new FL news flash in history says but don't you just hide your soul behind that Creed thinking that'll save you you'll never be saved until you find Christ as your personal Savior and his Spirit fill your life then these signs shall follow the that believe not a Frolic dance have you've seen a lot of the Pentecostals do not a morg like you see a lot of the rest of them do they're both the modern Church aren't they the intellectual and the emotional both still live right here but he says not a Frolic dance like you've seen a lot of Pentecostals do not a morg like you see the rest of them do and the Pentecostals are about out of their Frolic now they're back to the morg too but they probably don't think so right but they are why because they aged they didn't mature they frolicked but they didn't become fruitful they were quickened and they were enthused but when the word was presented to them they didn't submit you'll find there's a constant consistent theme in the message of the hour that brother bam identifies the response of the young trees to the Holy Ghost as being Frolic and there's nothing wrong with the frolic but if you don't mature you'll end up in the morg so Peter says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence verse 10 of second Peter 1 give diligence to make your call in an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall you'll never be unfruitful you'll never be Barren in the knowledge of Jesus Christ you'll never find yourself in the morg before you start when you start to get dry you'll Shake Yourself why because you're making your calling an election sure you don't make it sure by all these other things that we've talked about in these services but you make it sure by the word working in you brother Bram says in the sermon Christ revealed in his own word the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake out all the greenness out of you making matured Christians from green to fruitful from Frolic to fruitful from Frolic to fullness there's this this change changing says that in the invisible unit of the bride of Christ it can't go no further we're at the end time so what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's exact the word to be ripened your to bring forth and live what we're talking about I hope you can see that this is at the heart this is at the core of these things next time we Minister on this subject there's a I I had it in my notes to talk about how train up a child in the way that he should go and that when you see a son or daughter who's being raised and they're not doing the right thing it says you better correct them and it said I don't think it says Beat the Devil out of them but it says you know Drive hell from them Drive stubbornness from them apply the rod and what some what has what have some people done they've used it as a way to hurt and harm and frustrate and abuse their kids using the word and the same thing's done with statements in these sermons and they'll take it and they use it they twist it this way and they twist it that way and they TR create some picture or image that's used to abuse and it's used to prop up these The Fanatic or the scholarly and right there in the middle of it brother brandham saying the green trees the youngans need to grow up lay in the presence of the sun this word to be ripened in your heart and to live what we're talking about musicians if you'd come have a last statement to read and trying to do a god of of service without it being his will this is Saturday morning at the Full Gospel businessman's breakfast there in shreport he's just preached the invisible Union works as Faith expressed in the very next service he said the Shuck's pulling away no cooperation no nothing with it always it pulls away from it some people think the shuck is the seed but they're in the middle of it is the grain the true seed he says there can't be no more it's a wheat now but we're plenty green what is he looking at what is he identifying we're plenty green that's right you have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst to know that the spirit of the Living God moving in his word and showing us the things yet notice the sincerity the sacredness had some other statements that I could have read where brother BR was talking about the Frolic and the shouting and the dancing and he says you know what we we've got to come back to the sacredness of these things how people come up and they get all worked up and he says they do that and they miss it the sacredness to know what is in our midst to let the spirit of living God move appropriate in our lives so can show us things to come it increase our knowledge of of Jesus Christ so that we can live the things that we ought to live to where we don't just have Frolic or frigid but fruitful we're not on these either sides but we're right down the middle of the road young trees May Frolic but mature trees fruit and if you're a young Green Tree move move in that wind enjoy it exercise yourself let those roots get deeper but yield to the life that's working inside of you not just the anointing that's working outside of you but yield to that Holy Ghost and let him bring you to a fruitful tree let us be youngans that grow up let's pray together today if you could just stand with me [Music] [Music] let's bow our heads in this day and age that we're living in I think there's a there's a pressure that you've got to choose sides are you going to you going to vote for Trump or you going to tr vote for Harris got to choose the side which one are you on and I don't think you'd please either side by saying you don't have a choice I think if you are not a Trumper that the trumpers would hate you if you're not a Harris the harassers would hate you and it's really really hard to stay in the middle of the road anymore and I believe that the things that brother brandham taught he had to preach him in a way to get the attention of people on every side and we've got to be so careful you got to watch he said if he doesn't watch himself if you don't watch him we can end up in one of these sides when what God wants us to do is be right where he wants us to be fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ fruitful in the revelation of the word ears loose to hear a tongue loosed to speak we can enjoy all these other things but when we make a Creed out of it it's easier to enjoy them but when we submit and yield to the husbandman he purges us he chastises us he teaches us he trains us so let us be learning let us be applying let us be suffering that we may be growing certainly don't mind a little Frolic don't mind a little Wildfire love the emotion because it proves there's life in it but ultimately the life is to prove Itself by fruit God help us to do that let's pray Heavenly Father Lord today I thank you for your grace that you've had on us both to hear and to speak Lord myself to be able to get through so much uh of a burden Lord in this morning with all the different things that you had laid upon my heart to share so Lord I pray that you just be merciful to us now as we dismiss our service soon May the word just resonate in our hearts of the positive things that we could take away from this the reminder that you are a perfector that you having begun this this work you are faithful to finish it and Lord may we as we were reminded on Wednesday night and just it opened up to us that this fear that perfect love cast out is this fear of judgment let us not fear the hand of the dress of the vineyard for we are your husbandry we are your Vineyard Lord let us not fear your tender hand as it wants to shape us and mold us for Lord we know that you're only working in us purging us because you know that we can be fruitful we're not like the modern church but Lord we are your bride in this Rapture time in this Harvest Time and therefore the word of God is pruning and he's edging and he's doing these things to us so that we could become more fruitful so father I pray that we would yield ourselves to you not create a Creed at or doctrine around silent church services and not shouting amen or not being emotional cuz Lord that could only it's only abusing and manipulating the things you said Lord not making a Doctrine out of doing those things but just let the trees do as they can in the stage that they're in but Lord let the life prove Itself by coming forth in the entirety of the life the full manifestation of the word of God in your bride in this end time to do the works that Jesus did without sensation but yet with Works bless us I pray now as we commit the PE people to you bless them Lord be with them encourage them touch mise today Lord that he would be healed quickly bless sister Grace as she cares for him those here that are not feeling well Lord those traveling be with us I pray we ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
