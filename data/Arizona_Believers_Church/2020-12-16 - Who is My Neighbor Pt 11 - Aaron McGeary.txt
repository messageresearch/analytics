TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our bibles to luke chapter 10. luke chapter 10 gonna read verses 33 34 and 35. continue on the subject of who is my neighbor tonight it's going to be very very simple it just uh there's been some things kind of coming to this chronologically and there's just been a couple points that the lord had been impressed upon my heart that we wanted just to touch on and won't be much depth to it though i believe the holy spirit can also can take things that may seem very simple very surface and when you live it that's when it's deep when you take it and can actually apply it and live it luke chapter 10 verse 33 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him this is that certain man that went down from jerusalem to jericho and was left half dead by thieves said and he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee amen you may be seated i'm just going to jump right into it it may seem to be a little bit abrupt without much review or backtracking on things that we've ministered thus far for the first 10 parts in this but we've made mention of this before and you'll find i believe that as i've read in many many different commentaries have been studied on this subject now for several months the actions of this samaritan and again remember we're asking ourselves the question who is my neighbor to better understand our role within the community as message believers even as citizens of the state of arizona whether it be the county you live in the city you live in but really our role in responsibility as christians to one another and also to eat to mankind in general and so in asking the question who is my neighbor is drawn from this parable of the good samaritan and as i was mentioned a moment ago there's a lot of references uh when in studying the good samaritan how that christ is exemplified in the good samaritan and there's no doubt that we could see that the actions of the samaritan are reflective of the actions of christ who redeems us from our sin and we can each put ourselves in this journey as we're the man going down from jerusalem to jericho we're on our way to destruction which is what jericho represents we're beset by sin and we're left half dead we're spiritually dead we're we've a destitute of morals and just any way that you'd want to embellish it and take the very descriptive language that christ is using here and put ourselves into this picture and then we could see how that christ comes our way and religion couldn't help us in the form of the priest and religion couldn't help us in the form of the levite but yet christ comes to our aid he recovers us from our sins and and delivers us from our despair and and sets us on the right course and so we could we could see this as christ being reflective of this good samaritan we could place ourselves in the shoes of this certain man that's uh be fallen of thieves but i want to point this out that jesus uses these actions to define what it means to love thy neighbor as thyself because this is where the question who is my neighbor points back to this commandment that is written in the law to love thy neighbor as thyself this was elicited by the lawyer jesus said hey you've done good you've answered good if you do that you'll do well but then the lawyer seeking to justify himself says who is my neighbor so jesus uses the actions of the samaritan to define what it means to love thy neighbor as thyself and again this is just very simple uh we're just going to look at this these two verses here verses 33 and 34. actually we'll maybe get to we'll get to verses 34 and 35. just look at it for a moment and ponder jesus now using the actions of the samaritan to teach us what it means to love someone else or to love our neighbors as ourselves notice how descriptive christ gets we could just read it he says he went to him bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine set him on his own beast brought him to an end took care of him on the morrow he departed and took out two pence gave them to the host and said take care of him and whatsoever thou spend us more when i come again i will repay thee think about just how christ takes step by step walking us through a period of time wherein the samaritan is rendering aid to this jew who has been wounded and the great care that is given in rendering this aid think about how descriptive christ is getting and as you ponder it i ask myself couldn't have christ made the point with less description in other words you say well the the levite walks by and he says i don't want to deal with this the priest walks by says i don't want to deal with this and it seems that christ could have made the point by saying but when the samaritans saw him he went and helped him and then asked the lawyer which one was neighbor to him who fell among thieves and the lawyer would have answered again just the same he would have said the one that showed mercy on them but jesus does not just say that the samaritan stopped and helped him he goes through these processes and these actions of the samaritan covering what i want you to catch tonight a long period of time you say long was it weeks was it days no but it covers hours of him stopping to help this person who's been wounded and jesus is doing it to make a point he's doing it because he does not want us to think that loving our neighbors is casual he does not want us to think that loving our neighbors is just simply and oh yeah yeah you know bless your heart whatever you want but there's something more that's contained in this loving thy neighbor as thyself i want to focus first now in verse 34 as we have walked through each one of these where he came where he was he saw him had compassion on him and we understand that compassion scriptural compassion is to do the will of god that the the love of god is to do his will so it's not humanistic it's not carnal we don't want to try to put this in the category of you know you just need to where people sometimes get critical you're just a bleeding heart liberal or you're just this or you're just that it's not in the carnal realms of what love means love to love is to do the will of god that's what love is that's what compassion is but yet it's expressed this way in verse 34 and he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine so the binding of the wounds takes place with this activity of also pouring in oil and wine i think what i originally read it was he bound his wounds and he poured in oil and wine but the binding of the wound the healing of the womb the beginning of this healing process started with pouring in oil and wine and this oil and wine would have been mixed together and then applied the bible says in psalms 104 verse 15 just thinking about oil and wine together it says wine that maketh glad the heart of man an oil to make his face to shine in bread which strengtheneth man's heart you'll find over and over again through scripture especially in relation to offering and sacrifice that wine and oil are mentioned together it says wine makes the heart glad oil makes his face to shine these are the elements that jesus draws on when the samaritan is going to render aid and apply something to a wound in order to stop the bleeding in order to start the healing process he takes oil in wine and the wine would have had qualities which would have cleansed the wound just as we might take some sort of alcohol or some ointment now and apply it to a wound to clean out anything that might be a cause infection or any kind of dirt or grime the wine is poured in there to cleanse cleanse the wound and then the oil being mixed together with the wine it eases the pain caused by the wounds and this is the very image that's drawn from the scripture it's part of binding the wounds and what it as i pondered it and had been pondering over some time i realized that what this samaritan was doing was not just wanting to stop the bleeding and not just trying to clean up the situation to make it look a little bit better but he's doing the things necessary to promote healing here's somebody who is wounded he says now if he's wounded and he's bleeding then i want to i want to apply something that can clean the wound so that there's not infection later i want to apply something now that also begin to promote healing and ease his pain so this was for the purposes of promoting healing to rehabilitate the wound not just stop the bleeding the samaritan just wasn't squeamish let's just stop this let's cover this up i want to help but let's get this to a place where i can stomach it first no he was concerned about the long-term effects of the the wound he was concerned about what this ultimately could mean to this person's body if this wound festered and what it would mean to the person just to continue to hurt i i think it's a shame when we act in a way to intentionally hurt somebody and yes i mean physically i if you swing a if you swing at somebody with a baseball bat to to break their leg i think that's a shame if you do something to physically harm someone that's a shame but how callous and how cavalier we can be sometimes with our words that'll inflict wounds that are much deeper than physical wounds and so the samaritan is showing care and concern about how someone is feeling whether or not they're hurting what this long-term impact and the ramifications would be from these wounds and so he binds up his wounds he bound up his wounds and as he's binding up these wounds and no doubt using something he could apply such as the cloth or something to to tighten it up to cover it he's pouring in oil in wine the bible says in isaiah chapter 1 verse 6 from the soul of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrefying sores it says that's very descriptive i don't have a slide for it just imagine it they have not been closed neither bound up neither multiplied with ointment so as isaiah describes the body being from head to toe with wounds and bruises and open festering sores this is this is what ought to be done to a sword they ought to be clothed closed and bound up emulified ease the painties made tender softened with ointment and this is exactly what the samaritan does he sees a wound he sees someone hurting he takes the oil and the wine and begins to administer to the one that is hurting he takes care over these wounds to number one ease his pain with the oil number two deal with infection by cleansing it with the wine now this struck me in such a deep way today i'd been pondering this particular aspect of oil and wine and we find it in other places in scripture it says in revelation touch not the oil and the wine and there's a lot of different references to it in the word of god that you could draw from and i found to me it just seemed like these were two different subjects that you have the oil and the wine that's mole used to molify with ointment and to bind things up and wine used to cleanse the wound and oil to ease the pain and i was seeing this as a very specific application of physical things oil and wine and that you would draw a type from that and when the bible speaks of touch not the oil and the wine the message with our deals with oil and wine i was seeing them as two different things but the holy spirit just brought them together because i realized that the oil and the wine are our critical resources to us the very very important resources to us and i want you to think of it this way as i'm just going to read a few statements that are all made within a few days by brother branham when he's preaching the seals the third seal the fourth seal in question answers on the seals as he deals with oil and wine and i'm doing this not to kind of veer into this territory of oh you're teaching things from the word of god and the book of revelation and these symbols but this is to make the word of god very very practical to us and to realize that when the bible jesus uses these elements of oil and wine and places them within the hands of the samaritan to render aid to the jew who's been wounded and left half dead these are elements and resources that are critical to us as christians these are resources that are very critical to us as believers and it's not only the resource that we serve with as a samaritan took oil and wine mix them together to to aid someone who was wounded but it's the resource from which we serve so it's not just things we have in our medicine bag that we use to apply in a particular situation but it's the very resource from which we serve and you understand the point i'm trying to make there we can look at the oil and wine as elements that we take and we use on somebody or that we use in a particular situation and that we minister with but it's not just elements we minister with it's the very elements we minister from and if we do not have these elements do we know how to use oil and wine do we have we really have oil and wine to use at our disposal but it is the resource from which we minister so now when i read these statements i want you to think about them not in terms of all word and revelation but rather the resource the wealth from which you are serving and then it being oh a resource from which you're drawing from that you have to draw from then you have something to give the song i've been just going through my mind today is i've got something that the world can't give and the world can't take it away that's what you have if the world can't give it to you and the world can't take it away from you now brother branham says in the third seal oil typifies spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of revelation now the rest of these state the rest of these statements i'm reading or the rest of this statement and the next two statements are just really going to be saying the same thing the oil represents the spirit and wine symbolized symbolizes stimulation of revelation but it says boy i'd like to run all over the place it's a wonder i didn't wake up the neighborhood when the lord showed me that stimulation of revelation so wine represents stimulation of revelation now we know that the wine also represents blood represents the blood of jesus christ we could take that use as application how that we are covered in his blood and that we also claim the blood and we apply the blood and we have the token at our disposal and there's a whole line of teaching and instruction that we could take from that aspect but now the oil and wine together he brother says the oil represents the spirit the wine represents stimulation of revelation so when when you receive revelation it stimulates you and that's what wine does wine intoxicate wine stimulates so he's saying that the wine represents stimulation of revelation he says all and why in the bible are associated together always and you find this numerous instances in the old testament from early to the very end to the prophets and the major prophets minor prophets oil and wine oil and wine and the offerings that are made and and and the blessings that are it's represented in the blessings it says when the truth of the promised word of god has been truly revealed to a saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine is stimulation it says gloria i feel it right now stimulated with joy and shouts and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man rebrand in another place talks about how you take a man who's all slumped down give him some wine what's it do it perks him up and he gets all kind of stimulated and bubbly he's saying the revelation of the word is the same thing to the believer now if you're feeling a little bit melancholy get into the word of god pray for revelation it's the best thing you can have for feeling melancholy and slump down and despondent a little depressed we say that this is as the song goes it's the most wonderful time of the year well a lot of people don't feel that way it can be a dreary time a depressing time it can be a difficult time and if it's not the most wonderful time of the effort just get into the word of god and pray for revelation it's going to stimulate you it's going to perk you up it's going to give you a little bit of bubbling going on in your soul so it says stimulate with joy and shouts and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man because when the revelation has been given of the truth of god and the true believer filled with oil and revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself unnormally unnormally that's when it's really not normal you behave yourself unnormally why it's something that impacts the believer motivates them to act causes them to think differently and that's why people can say how can you be happy in a time like this you have a different resource how can you view a situation as dire as that and have such a positive outlook and an attitude of joy and and excitement in the midst of everything that's so chaotic it's because you have a different reservoir from which you're drawing from something else is stimulating you something else is exciting you you're not going by all the economic factors you're not going by the political factors you're not going by the things that are going on in the world today you have a different source and it causes you to behave yourself a normally it's the stimulation of revelation so oil represents the holy spirit wine represents the stimulation of revelation brother bam says that the fourth seal oil is symbolized as the holy spirit says then we find out that oil and wine is connected in worship always connected in worship so now brother branham brings them together all in wine or associated together in the bible now he says they're associated together in worship then the way it's the way these things came together where you just don't have the samaritan utilizing these elements to uh to heal to bind up a wound in this parable and then you have these other elements of oil and wine and the spirit and revelation and then being separate i begin to realize that yes the way that we live the way that we conduct ourselves the way that we respond to one another is part of our worship to god the use of the elements and resources that god gives us the way that we utilize them the way that we apply them the way that we liberally give them out the way that we want to be used by god is connected with our worship of god so it's is this oil and wine are connected together in worship it's not distinct or separated from even how jesus uses it in this parable he says the wine symbolizes the power of stimulation by revelation and when something's been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by revelation so again all represents the spirit wine represents stimulation by revelation and now oil and wine are connected in worship in the message question and answers on the seals he says oil as we look in the cymbals means the holy spirit wine and oil is connected together in the bible in worship so oil and wine oil represents the holy spirit wine and oil are connected together again in worship in the wine he says that's where i got the idea of stimulation wine stimulates and wine is the anti-type of its natural form from simulation is revelation so as wine stimulates the flesh revelation stimulates the spirit now just think what stimulates the church revelations so wine the new wine would be the oil and wine together now he says this the oil and wine went together in sacrifice went together in church worship assembled together connected together and if you again you go to the old testament you find where there's an offering made or there's to a tithing a gift a blessing put out it refers to oil in the wine oil and wine are so often frequently mentioned together and verb says they're come together in worship they come together connected together in church worship and went together in sacrifice he says now the oil is always the holy spirit we find it over in ezekiel we find in the old testament we find all through the new testament why do we anoint the sick with oil we anoint the sick with oil because it symbolizes the pouring out of the holy spirit upon them also the wise virgins had oil the unwise had no oil spirit now that that is the oil so what does the oil represent the holy spirit how is that applicable to us that would be uh in this mode of the good samaritan or in the model of the good samaritan we likewise must have the holy spirit we must have the holy spirit church can never be confused as merely trying to equip carnal people with principles that allow them to navigate the world a little bit softer a little bit easier no the goal of church the goal of preaching the gospel is to take a center to a place of a new birth experience which is to be sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost and now they possess eternal life they have a resource themselves now as a born-again son or daughter of god they're led by the spirit of god they've got something on the inside they have the inside teacher the most important teacher there is they have the comforter the paracletos they have something on the inside and it's that that the word of god speaks to if we knew right now that we were all carnal and that we we didn't have the holy ghost there was no such thing as the power of the holy ghost then this would be no different than a seminar just trying to drill into your head certain things that you could try to do to make your days a little bit easier and you'd have nothing to dig down deep and grab a hold of and cause it to act but that is not what we're engaging in this isn't a seminar this isn't a self-help evening on in the middle of the week to get you over hump day but rather the dynamics of the supernatural word of god is being spoken to supernatural seeds who can take that word to omnipotence meat and you can leave out that door back there and you can have something supernatural going before you living out through your flesh that's the blessing and the privilege of being a son and daughter of god is you have god on the inside that can make this word live and that's what we're drawing from when we say the al the oil represents the holy spirit it's not just something we're going to go and pick up and use but rather you've got it on the inside therefore it's at your disposal to use we can ask for god ask god to give us wisdom when we see a situation and say lord i'm being challenged on wednesday nights to love my neighbor as myself i don't want to rush too heavy into this i'm not sure what the situation may be say holy spirit give me wisdom lord i i'm not sure how just to act so i'll pray in the spirit i'll commit it to you in prayer and we ask god to help us oil represents the holy spirit it's the holy spirit that you want to go forth from you to minister to somebody else to come on the scene when you're in a difficult situation and then together with it brother i'm saying that the wine now the wine represents he says it's the the wine represents stimulation of revelation so oil symbolize the pouring of the holy spirit wine represents the stimulation of revelation he says if the oil represents god god is a spirit god is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was made flesh and that was god now if the word now sets here in natural form and i'm sure he's talking about the bible the wine is the water like the revelation that reveals that interpretation of the word which stimulates the believer he says i've never seen it before my glory stimulation of revelation so if we could take these elements together now just ponder it's very simple brother madam tells us that oil represents the holy spirit wine is the stimulation of revelation to the believer who has the oil so the wine is the revealed word to the believer when the word is revealed to you it stimulates you oh i've never seen that before glory it's the stimulation of revelation these two elements we must have in our lives what's what's going to be the most effective way to witness from from revelation not education if you've been educated into something and i'm sure you could all think about it right now and if we could solicit an example i'm sure some of you could share some very comical ones wherein you learned something in the message by education and then you tried to share it with somebody else and you're like oh man get this this is great you got to see this and you begin to explain it to them you realize what in the world am i talking about and they don't have any idea what you're talking about because by education you just tried to educate somebody else and you're not a very good educator and it doesn't make sense it doesn't come out right it doesn't it doesn't even seem like it's even making any sense but when something is revealed to you then from a position of revelation there's a stimulation that comes and then there's a witness of what god has shown to you yeah you may not be able to explain it you may lay it out just exactly the way that it's been given to you but revelation is the best resource from which to witness if you've been saved if you've been filled with the holy ghost the revelation of the new birth the revelation of jesus christ personally too is the best point from which you can witness and testify of a new birth to somebody else so these are things that we use at our disposal as christians things that we we have we can we say well this is what i have i have oil and wine that i could render aid but it's from oil and wine that you have this resource from which you can minister from and the way that it finally struck me and these things kind of came together where i wasn't just looking at two different examples in scripture of how oil and wine are represented is i realized that if we are not if we do not have the holy spirit and we are not being stimulated by revelation we cannot love our neighbors as ourselves we cannot minister we cannot serve we cannot we cannot be christ-like and live for others there is not a separation of these works that we would do that are christian and and kind and sincere and loving from this experience of a genuine new birth and the revelation of god's word and when i say the revelation of god's word i mean all seven seals the bright age the seven thunders you name it genesis to revelation all of it it's all applicable it all matters it's all worth it and it begs the question now i'm not posing this question to you i'm posing this question to myself maybe some of you would be humble enough to ask yourself this question or if we're all just feeling pretty pretty randy today and pretty good may we just think about somebody else and wonder i wonder if they're unable to love their neighbors as themselves because they lack the holy spirit or they don't have the stimulation of revelation and think of it in in that context because i know this is very simple and i could be brow beating certain whatsapp groups for being you know maybe real simple and very baptist-like and not pentecostal enough but i want you just to be very honest with yourselves and think about this that if this is what oil symbolizes this is what wine symbolizes and yet we are commanded and commissioned and we ought to love our neighbors as ourselves is the lack thereof the result of the lack of the holy spirit and the lack of stimulation of revelation yes now it seemed that that wouldn't necessarily be what we would think of well he has a hard time loving his neighbor those seals just haven't quite come open to him yet we we wouldn't say that but could it be could it be that people we are not walking fully in the attitude and character of christ because the very things that we pay lip service to of revelation and depth of the word and third pull and seven seals and all these different things aren't fully dawning on us and being quickened to us and revealed to us to stimulate us to act unnormally that if the word is really being revealed to us it's going to change our character it's going to change our nature it's not going to puff you up revelation is going to puff you up make you all arrogant look down on everybody who doesn't know what the third pull is but as the word is revealed to you and it softens you and it multiplies you and you're you're getting the ointment and you're getting the revelation and you have all and why i'm being put into you you're gonna have a different character and a different demeanor and a different approach to others you don't need to come on real strong with people it's the it's those who are unsure it's those who are weak those who have insecurities those that have complexes they got to come on real strong and real arrogant real condescending but when you know where you stand you can just go ahead and get real small real small to somebody just get beneath them and just start wherever you can and what begin to minister to somebody from a position of strength because you have the oil and you've been stimulated by revelation let's challenge ourselves and ask ourselves if we're finding it difficult to love our neighbors as ourselves is it because the oil is not freely operating is it because there's no stimulation of revelation and it's an easy fix to the believer get stimulated get into the world let it stimulate it let it break up the fallow ground let it break up the hardness and the complexes and all the fears and insecurities and let us take the oil and the wine to bind up wounds love our neighbors as ourselves now as we continue to read it says and he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast this now speaks to just how selfless this samaritan was and i know it seems fairly logical that if someone was half dead you wouldn't want to drag him behind your beast or force him to walk and you know come on let's go you're slowing me down but jesus mentioned it as a point of care that he set him on his own because he selflessly walked beside the wounded took the wound and placed him on his own beast begin to walk beside him and himself maybe using that beast and being carried forward he now takes steps down from the position that he had and he takes the wound and he sets him up on the beast now he's going to walk himself but now he's placed this one who's wounded in a place of greater ease and greater comfort where it makes his way easier i'll take the heart away i'll walk i'll trudge i'll carry maybe laden with more things now that i have someone taking my place upon my animal but i'm going to walk selfishly beside you and i'm going to let the energy and the power this piece carry you on and maybe my way will be a little bit harder but it's going to be better for you in this case that's something we can learn we can learn just from this aspect alone that he took the wounded and set him on his own beast and i'm gonna i'm taking it maybe a little bit out of order because it says and it brought him to an end and i just want to say this at this point it speaks to his commitment that it was a journey that he would take with the wounded all the way to the end he didn't just kind of get him said now do you know where you're at you kind of understand your orientation you see this road here go ahead and follow this when you get down around that corner just to your left kind of go down this little nook there there'll be an end there and and you will see that you will come check on you later maybe no he said i'm going to walk with you i'm committed to you and i'm going to go with you and take you as the one that is wounded is the one who needs the help i'm going to walk with you and i'm going to use my my beast i'm going to carry you and it's going to be a little bit harder for me and maybe a little bit easier for you but i'm going to i'm committed in the journey to getting you to a place where you can get the help that you need is that does that speak to you is that something that strikes you think there's a way i can make this applicable in my life where i'm committed to something i don't just have a hot sports opinion about it or a hot take or you know you want to tell you you want my two cents right well i'll tell you what you should do and we can always we always can monday morning quarterback we can always have something that we can say about how somebody did something else wrong or you wouldn't be in this mess if this hadn't happened and we got all sorts of hot takes on it right but where's the commitment to say all right i'm committed in your situation right now there's a place of safety there's a place ahead let's walk in this journey together i'll be with you and i'll take your journey i'll take this journey with you to see that you get the help that you need it says that he set him on his own beast and brought him to an end we'll come back to that lord willing here in a moment and took care of him this speaks of our personal responsibility as a christian the samaritan himself brought him to an end and it says the samaritan now the samaritan took care of him this is our individual duty our personal responsibility as a christian we may feel overwhelmed just taking care of ourselves can i get an amen we feel overwhelmed just taking care of ourselves but we have a responsibility as christians to take care of others and this is not a duty that we can pass off to the church and i know that sometimes in our minds we we think that there's just kind of like this mythical thing that just kind of functions in the ether called the church and things just get done but you want to know how things get done in church just look around this is how things get done in church people do things people volunteer people visit and they hop on the base people who don't normally play an instrument volunteer to play an instrument people don't normally leave songs uh lead songs and sometimes they quit after they volunteer but there's people who give and they and they help and they render aid and they do things and that's how things function and that's how things operate is because people offer people are getting things done and so we think oh well the church will take care of it well who's taking care of it if the church has taken care of it you thought about that who's looking out after it it can't all be one person and so it's the duty that we do not pass off to a church it's a duty that we don't just pass off to a preacher it's a duty we don't pass off to anyone else we all have to be in this together in philippians chapter 2 verse 4 it says look not every man on his own things we've been drawing from philippians chapter 2 quite a bit already look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others now there's a lot of grace here it doesn't tell you not to look on your own things right it says look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others it's a given you're going to be worried about your own it's a given that you're concerned about your own situation your own family your own needs your own wants all these different lackings that you might have your own health your own uh well-being your own job your own finances and so it's a given that you would look on your own things but don't just look on your own things let every man also look upon the needs and the things of others and we could say paul establishes this as the duty of every man the duty of every woman not just to be worried about your own but also to look after the needs of others the things of others in other words none of us have a right to live only unto ourselves none of us none of us have a right to live only for ourselves in disregard to others now we have a right to look after our needs to look after our own look after our family to care for our own household to be sure that we're taken care of and it's a given that we would be worried about that or concerned about that or we would take great care to see that certain needs are met but none of us have a right to live within that paradigm alone you say well man being a christian is a lot more than i bargained for you better believe it it's living for others that's what eternal life is is living for others and so we cannot just live to ourselves not even as a church not even as a family there's got to be something that opens us up to where we're willing to serve others live for others do something for somebody else and to express the love of god to those who may seem to be undeserving of it to do things for others who are in a position of need and want because we are not allowed as christians this is the duty of every man we do not have a right to live for ourselves in disregard to others and really this scripture counters our selfless nature because i think in general my instinct you know we're just we're selfish we're going to look out after our own we're going to do what we need to do to make sure we're taken care of it's not generally instinctive for someone to defer and to to share and to give though we meet people who are that way and i'm sure you could think of people just seem to be instinctively even some children just will it be instinctive to share and they don't like to see somebody suffer or sad or hurt him but the scripture is countering and striking out against our selfless nature and it's meant to provoke us to express the love of christ paul touches on it later on in that same chapter philippians chapter 2 verses 20 and 21 he says for i have no man like mine he said i'm a sin timothy he's going to take care of you because i don't have anyone who thinks like me and acts like me who will naturally care for your state so i i know timothy will i'm going to send timothy because he's more like-minded he'll naturally care for your say he'll be concerned about you and the situation you're in but notice what he says about mankind in general or maybe everyone else that he knew for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christ this is kind of companion to what he says in verse 4 every man also should look upon the things of others but we all are willing to seek our own in not the things which are jesus christ it tells me that there's something about seeking someone else's need and meeting something else's needs that's inherent in a character of jesus christ and listen if if there's a uh whether it be within a family or a relationship within the body of christ i can say this as christians as believers our unity is broken by selfishness that's what's gonna break unity and when we only give attention to our own needs we're building walls walls without gates we're building walls without bridges there's no there's no uh harmony there's no coming together and so it's our unity is broken by selfishness so paul says every man also on the things of others it's to challenge us out of our selfishness it's in this vein that the samaritan took care of him unselfish willing to give willing to help now brother branham this i don't want to read a couple statements here on this thought of taking care of him and our duty as a christian brother brown when he's preaching the revelation of jesus christ and he's taking the pergamon church age he's talking about saint martin this messenger he's talking about one of the greatest miracle-filled lives of anybody in the church ages he said he was a soldier and one day he was coming by and there was a man laying cold and shivering and all the people was not willing was able to help the man but they just pas pass by him like the priest and levites did the good samaritan so now brother branham takes saint martin as the soldier walking by this man who's cold shivering and able people are walking by and he puts them in the figure of the priest and the levite but now he brings us to the image of the good samaritan but when saint martin come by realizing his duty as a christian believer he had one coat a cloak over his shoulders he cut it in two with this sword and gave half of it to the beggar and he took the other half and that night began his career for jesus christ appeared to him in a vision wrapped in that same robe that he cut into which fulfilled the scripture in so much as you've done unto these you've done it unto me he says so take for a lesson now this brother branham taking this as a lesson using the life of saint martin and this act in which he realized his duty as a christian believer he says whatever you do to somebody you're doing it unto christ now he says whatever you do to somebody you're doing it unto christ now if you just took that principle it said all right from now on whatever i do to anybody i'm going to imagine or think that i'm doing it unto christ how different would our lives be all of a sudden like those dms you've been sending or whatever it is you do to you know to be mean to somebody and bully somebody if all of a sudden you realize i'm texting christ i'm talking about christ i'm about to do a shady deal on christ i'm about to undercut this christ and you just change it to her now whatever you're doing it you're doing it to christ that should moderate conduct right hopefully you know otherwise i think he can handle he's a big boy i mean it would change the way that we would act because now we're like no whatever i do to somebody no matter how low down dirty rotten scoundrel they are whatever i do to somebody i'm doing it unto christ he says let's say it together and it says the congregation brethren speak in unison what you do to others you have done to christ it's different even in saying do unto others as you'd have them do unto you it is what you do to others you have done to christ brother bam does not qualify whatever you do to a holy spirit feel believer who believes in the the bride age and believes all seven seals are open and believes this and believes that you've done unto christ he said whatever you've done to somebody else whatever you've done to anybody else you've done unto christ he says so no matter what he thinks about you it's what you think about him that brings the blessing wow praise the lord gives me an opportunity to kind of reverse the curse somebody may think very negatively about me somebody have made very negative things to say about me but it's not what he thinks about me it's what i think about him that brings the blessing now how negative and how much vitriol and venom and animosity someone could have and lies and hatred and whatever they can say about you say well i'm not going to let that change my attitude because if there's going to be a blessing it's going to be in a blessing is in how i think about him so i'm going to think about him differently even that he's thinking about me and that avails myself to a blessing what you do to others you have done to christ so no matter what he thinks about you it's what you think about him i'm using this to amplify the actions of the good samaritan wherein he took care of him we've even mentioned before how the hymn is a jew that would have been a bitter enemy a rival to the samaritan he took care of him this is our personal responsibility this is our individual duty as christians not something we shirk not something we pass off to someone on a board not something we pass off to a preacher not something we pass off to the ether it's something we individually have a duty to do bill abraham says in the message why every one of you has got something to do now every one of you get right in your church and work just as hard as you can for your local church i think that's wonderful work hard for your local church he says but don't ever criticize now this is to me it kind of takes uh um it takes maybe a different turn or begins to amplify a pain a little bit different part of this picture but think about the first part of this get to work every one of you has got something to do work just as hard as you can for your local church now he says but don't ever criticize why if you're working for your local church guess what we're not the only one right i've always wondered why is it called the first baptist church of phoenix you know does it mean the first one there and what's that what does that say about everybody else but we're not the first message church we're one among many we're not the only church we're not the only local church but what does brother bradham identify the tendency for there to be rivalry in competition and comparison so he says but don't ever criticize if you know something bad about the other side don't say nothing about it keep that to yourself i don't notice anybody writing it down i'm gonna i'll go slowly here don't never criticize double negative so it reinforces it if you know something bad about the other side don't say nothing about it you get it he says keep that to yourself the enemy's just listening to hear that my don't let him know nothing don't speak nothing out then he won't know nothing about it keep it to yourself and pray i think that's good get in and work all you can for your local church do everything you can for the body that god places you in be a part of it sell out to it and that you're going to give yourself and your time and your prayers and your energy and your resources do something for the kingdom of god but in doing so it doesn't create rivals it doesn't create factions and if somebody's doing something wrong and something's gone haywire or something's gone sideways don't be talking about it don't criticize it you're only undermining all the good you're doing you don't ever want there to be a narrative associated with what you're doing where things become anti-and things become against before something be positive keep it to yourself and pray say well the poor brother did wrong but don't down him he's down anyhow try to pick him up lift him up be the good samaritan try to pick him up if you can't even talk to him well i can't even talk to the guy pray for him till it is that way if you can't talk to him then pray for him until you can if you can't even talk to him pray for him till he it is that way just keep him on your heart because his soul's worth ten thousand worlds oh if god could just impress that upon us sometimes the people that we're so burdened by or so offended by are so hurt by that if we could still yet realize to god the soul is worth ten thousand worlds we may not be able to talk to them but could we pray till we could he says he so he's saying you've got something to do every one of you get right into church work just as hard as you can but let's not be critical don't criticize if something happens wrong something on the other side the enemy's just listening to hear what you want to say keep it to yourself pray for him he says be the good samaritan try to pick him up and gain an ally in the cause of christ he took care of him went to and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine set him on his own beast brought him to an end and took care of him this was not just a few minutes of pretending that he cared oh you sit there and you're getting your tires changed at big o tires and so when you say hey how are you doing the person says oh i'm glad you asked and you're like i think they're calling me my tires are done it's not just kind of sitting there and just trying to suffer through a conversation oh i can just get through this conversation it's not it's not just hearing somebody out and then trying to ease your way out of the conversation this was more than just a few moments of pretending to care even to this point everything he's done has demonstrated there's more to it i want you to notice what the bible says he went to him bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine set him on his own beast and brought him to an end jesus being so descriptive step by step even as he came to where he was went down to where he was came to him saw him did all these things he's acting described step by step by step but now as the stories unfolding he set him on his own beast brought him to an end that's covering some duration and then it says in verse 35 and on the morrow when he departed he spent the night with him i want you to think about that it wasn't just that day it just wasn't a moment of what can i do for you but the samaritan took them to the end and he overnighted with them he stayed with them through the night through the hard part the difficult part he's there at the outset in the beginning probably the most horrible time it would have been for this traveler all of a sudden his travels completely interrupted in the darkness of night and the chaos of the night in the strange place with wounds that are still hurting here is he stays with him through the night and he gives us the image of the samaritan not just bringing him to the place and dumping him at the on the the in the foyer of a hotel but he says give me two rooms give me one next to his and let me stay with them and watch with them through the night he says and on the morrow when he departed it tells us he stayed with him all night and that means something to you does it does it speak to you that the samaritan was willing to go list a little bit further take just a little bit more more care and on the moral when he departed it could very well just say took care of them through the night and stayed with them till the morning verse 35 and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pins this would have represented some significant portion of a wage a monthly wage a you know salary earned and gave them to the host there's not even going to income you know burden the host you say this is my responsibility i found the man i brought him here my duty does not stop here though i may depart whatever you need here's something to begin with he says and he said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend this more when i come again i will repay thee i'm just going to be wrapping up here just have two statements i want to read from the message and close but now the scene changes just a little bit for we could imagine that the samaritan departs and in the samaritan and the bible says he took care of him that represents our personal responsibility as a christian the duty that is imposed upon every man we as message believers have this individual duty to take care of to love our neighbor as ourselves but now it changes and the samaritan says take care of him and i want this to represent our duty as a church that this is our responsibility in responsibility and duty as a church together that not only do we individually take care of him but we also as a church take care of him something we do together now just i'm just wrapping this up just closing here brother branham says in the message jezebel religion he says remember the good samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him to the end and brother brahman says that's the church i'm glad we have a place to take people i'm so i thank god for this church i'm so glad we have a place that we can take people and we don't just send them to a website we don't just send them to a youtube channel but we have a place that we can send them he says he brought him to an end that's the church you have an individual responsibility to take care of others to love others as yourselves to to to render aid to to do these things that we're talking about but then we also have this responsibility as a church that when we have ministered to others witness to others when we are personally evangelizing we have a place that we can bring them and we bring them to the end brother says that's the church and gave the man their two pence and told him if he needed any more he'd pay him when he come so he's got two pence he's able to doctor you up if he's a man of god if he's a man of god that stands on the word of god he's got what god give him the spirit and the word and let me say this church has the spirit and the word and we ought not be ashamed to bring people to the end to invite people to the end i mean this is almost very literally and in i mean the residence inn is next door i think this is the courtyard by marriott here we are this is the end this is a hotel let's invite people to the end we have a place that we can invite them we have a we have the spirit and we have the word we don't fall we don't lack at all in these things we don't fall behind the body of christ at all in these things in spirit and the word we have these resources at our disposal they've been committed to this local church we have faithful people we have a desire and our hearts to serve let us be up and doing let us give all that we can every one of you's got something to do now every one of you get right in your church work just as hard as you can for your local church go out bring them to the end we've got spirit and word that can minister to people we have it at our disposal and brother branham in the message let us see god that's what we want to see we want to see god we want to see him lived out in us we want to see him manifested he says now i want to say this that every person that's been converted this week now look at this bunch of ministers they stand for the same thing that i do some of those have been converted these new converts he says we haven't one difference at all we're absolutely the same we believe in the full gospel the baptism of the holy ghost all these things all these ministers here we're all just exactly the same and we want you to join their church so you can continue on and he says the good samaritans come by poured oil in the wound this is how he uses that image of christ he comes by he pours oil in the wound christ coming by witnessing rendering aid ministering to somebody christ coming by doing something for somebody then what's the next thing what do we do we have a responsibility as a church to care just the same so he says the samaritans come by he's poured in oil in the wound but he's took you now and he wants you to go to one of the ends here the closest to you he's done paid the pastor to take care of you so he's paid now he says it's about the pastor this will be said about each one of us he's received the holy ghost got blessings of god and health and revelation he can just feed your soul so you come now and join one of the churches and it'll be the best thing that you can do to keep your spirit fed and moving on whoo i like that this is how the prophet instructs us i know to those who come to the end on a wednesday night believe in church i know you do i know that there's dozens now streaming who would like to be here unable to do so because of different situations and health and things so i know that we believe in this but let us be inspired to it you have the oil the holy ghost you have stimulation of revelation as you dig into this word we have the res that resource from which we're ministering from and it's resources that we have to give and that's our into as a individual i have a responsibility to look upon the needs of others as an individual i have a responsibility to love my neighbor as myself and then all of us collectively as a church we join together in this burden to take care of them as well that if you bring someone in your family who's hurting i am committed to helping you bring somebody that you love and somebody you witness to you're going to invite them to this church this church is going to minister going to render aid this is going to be a place of safety this is going to be a place of ministry this could be a place where someone can find health and revelation where their souls can be fed not a place where they can figure out just how short they come and just how they don't have it figured out how little they know but a place that they can come and find christ because just as the samaritan took care of him christ stands i believe commissioning us and telling us here i've given you what you need now you take care of him and now it's our responsibility let's stand to our feet maybe we could sing that song in the key of say i love you lord and i lift my voice to worship you [Music] i'd like to offer prayer for you tonight if you just bow your heads those of you who are here you'd want to just say lord help me fulfill my duty i'm a beneficiary of your love lord i'm a beneficiary of your kindness i'm i'm the product of a good samaritan now lord use me for your glory just want to lift your hands the lord help us to be better servants more committed more humble our gracious heavenly father lord it's been wonderful to have been in your presence tonight lord i'm going to close the service as the hours late but before we go lord i pray that you would bless your children that are here tonight bless those that are streaming lord may you be with them to encourage them those who have expressed their desire to be present with us and unable to be here lord i know there's something in these things that have been expressed and shared that stirring something within their hearts lord we could say those of us who've been here tonight we've we felt something stirring in our hearts we're inspired lord he even matches and aligns with things that we've expressed to others lord how that we have a desire to do more and there's greater passion and desire to see you move in our midst not in a church service floor but in our families and in the those that we associate with we see people who are hurting people who are confused there's storm clouds on the horizon father but yet we have shoulders back and chin up while others are fretting and others are frantic lord we want to be able to minister peace to them father i pray tonight if there be a soul that's wondered into this congregation tonight who's hurting who's anxious and who's lost may they experience the oil and the wine now father being mixed together to soothe the wound lord may it be multiplied with ointment may it ease their pain may it promote healing father also likewise may we be those who can be your hands extended that could pour in the oil and the wine that can minister peace and safety to those who are hurting and scared that we can witness an evangelize of this great truth to others do it father without fear do it without complex certainly lord do it without arrogance and i pray lord that we would fulfill our individual duty to take care of others to look upon the needs of others as we do our own needs father i pray for all of us who are here tonight that we could fall under this bird in this commission as a church to take care of them let us take care of them lord so father i say now send them send them lord bring the lost bring the hurting bring the confused bring the wounded bring the scattered lord for we stand ready to take care of them lord i will not just be for our service lord we'll stay with them or remain with them we'll endure with them through the night lord i believe that you have commissioned us you have equipped us you have given us what we need as a church we have the two pence we have healing we have salvation we have the spirit we have the word we have health we have revelation father i say send them we stand ready to care for them i commit the people to you tonight now father touch us i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
