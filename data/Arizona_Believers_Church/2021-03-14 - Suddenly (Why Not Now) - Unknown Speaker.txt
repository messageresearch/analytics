TRANSCRIPT
========================================
galatians chapter 3 verses 1 to 9 o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what i learned of you receive ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture for seeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preach the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham let's bow our heads in a word of prayer our heavenly father we are just basking in your glory today we are enjoying your presence we looked out upon the congregation and though we see several families that are gone because of travel and because of moving uh certain situations and for vacation spring break lord we still see some that are gathered here today that the devil tried to keep away and tried to physically hinder from coming and different weaknesses of the flesh and circumstances so lord we see victory we see a rejoicing in the people's hearts to be able to be here today and lord i pray that you would bless those that are streaming those that have listened to the archive those that are here present with us that in engaging in that activity lord we're not doing it just to find out who's at church or what brother aaron has to say or lord it's not even done to be critical to try to find something to trip me up on lord but those that will hear are coming to hear your word and to receive from you so i pray lord that you would make this edifying and beneficial to your body that you would be glorified in it that you would take control of this service for your glory lord as we have different needs that have been mentioned in our church and mentioned before the people we are desiring that you would come upon the scene lord we have anointed with oil and we've prayed for the sick and we keep hearing testimony after testimony of your healing power delivering from cancers and unstopping ears that couldn't hear lord just so many different testimonies in our midst it gives us confidence to believe that as we pray for sister morgan's grandmothers we pray for brother elias lord as we pray for these different needs that have been lifted up as we pray for brother james hayes lord we just know that you'll come upon the scene and you'll you'll do miracles and you can bring to pass those things which are pleasing in your sight so today lord as we stand in your divine presence we desire to hear from you come take the bread of life and speak to us we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may have your seats i'll give you my title in just a few moments and i want to let you know up front that i'm preaching a one-off or maybe just a different sermon a singular sermon today not continuing in the line of um what does wisdom look at look like so if you're one of those types where you take a lot of notes and you're praying and you're under expectation and you're reading in your bible and then you try to anticipate where i'm going so you're trying to see how these things fit i'm going to do you a favor by saying i'm going into on a completely different direction different subject this morning if you could let's look at verse 2 in our text galatians chapter 3 verse 2 as this is speaking about the just living by faith and how there is only one faith and one faith in jesus christ and he's using the phrase foolish galatians and how they've been bewitched to not obey and he's getting to the heart of where they're what they're getting into to keep them from obeying and in verse two he says this only what i learn of you receive ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith he's asking them the question did you receive the seal of god did you receive the holy ghost were you born again by works is it something you did is it something you accomplished did you receive this by keeping of the law or was it by the hearing of faith he revisits the same question in verse five he there therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith so he's asking the works that you see the things that are made manifest in your presence after he has already established that you have not received the spirit uh by the works of the law and if you received it by grace and you received it by faith and are you now made perfect by the flesh he asked it in this way so then also ponder that if these things were accomplished by the hearing of faith then you should look at the totality of everything else that the preaching of the word the working of miracles among you is not done by the works of the flesh or the works of the law but by the hearing of faith and so the hearing of faith consists not in working but in receiving the hearing of faith as he's putting in this in this context and he's using this phrase to delineate from the works of the law bringing stuff to pass and bringing a promise to you and how a promise is fulfilled he says it's it's in receiving faith consists not in your works and not in the law but in receiving so he's saying you have not merited the holy ghost you did not earn that you did not work your way into the baptism of the holy ghost he's saying the miracles that are right among you are not worked into and practiced into these things are done by the hearing of faith and so the word preached produces a faith to receive the holy spirit he's saying you receive the spirit by the hearing of faith so the gospel preached work within you to produce a faith to receive the spirit he's saying the same is how you benefit from the miracles of the spirit the word preached the word ministered raises your faith to believe and then to receive miracles and that's how miracles are wrought among the congregation and that's how and even within the body of christ and this is what paul is trying to say don't be foolish don't be bewitched it's by the hearing of faith when he writes to the romans he says in romans chapter 10 verse 17 so then faith cometh by hearing in hearing by the word of god so this is a principle that we all understand but i'm wanting just to raise it here in the beginning to lay some of these principles how that faith comes by hearing of the word of god that we have faith because we have heard the word you do not get faith by hearing fables you do not get faith by hearing a lie you do not get faith by uh just reading a science fiction novel but you get faith by the word of god so faith's final resting place is in the word as you hear the word as you receive the word it instigates and inspires faith and it's that hearing of faith that hearing of faith as paul refers to it that is going that allows one to receive the spirit it's the hearing of faith that allows someone to receive a miracle that's the principle by which the word operates so faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god as we hear the word it brings faith and it produces a faith so my title today is suddenly this is this is the title that i'm wanting to use is suddenly just this phrase suddenly and so the suddenness this immediate immediately i'm wanting to think in terms of something happening very quickly very suddenly and i'm asking the question why not now and i'm i'm preaching this this morning to build your faith and maybe for some it would be just a little bit of a recalibration of faith or just to orient our faith because our faith must be a word only faith our faith must only be to the word it must only be to god there are certain things that we could be looking to for god to accomplish and so we say well i believe this is going to work and this is going to achieve a certain result but our confidence has to be into in the god who led us in that path we can't just say well i've got confidence that jeff bezos is going to make the right decisions to keep amazon prime at the price that it is now for the next five years otherwise it's gonna break my budget but if you felt that god had quickened that to you that he can move upon the heart of a billionaire to keep prices stable so that your budget doesn't break then your confidence isn't in capitalism your confidence is in a god who's promised to keep you and so that's where our faith must always rest not not in your own wisdom not in your own abilities not in certain things that the the indicators are trending the right way but i we're wanting to speak to something that will build your faith and then even help us to take faith which is strong and place it solely in the word of god because it's the only place strong faith is effective you can have a lot of faith and a lot of confidence but project it towards the wrong things and your faith isn't going to bring you the benefit that it can like you can when it's it's projected into the word so keep this thought in mind suddenly this this is a phrase that was just working within my heart suddenly and we're going to be asking the question why not now and this is derived from a subject that i've been studying for a few months now to minister on called christ my healer not just christ the healer but christ my healers the lord has been dealing with my heart very deeply about divine healing and not only in the context of divine healing but even the healing of the soul the deliverance of the deliverance of our spirits from certain bondages and weaknesses or addictions uh thinking in terms of redemption and restoration and so there's a lot of different ways that the word of god works within our lives to accomplish certain things and we can say it through salvation and the new birth experience by sealing me into the body of christ this is this is a salvation of the soul and that works by faith that's a healing of the soul and then we may think well we're thinking of terms we need divine healing we need god to heal our bodies then then this is a promise within the word of god but then there's also the redeeming of something that we've lost that doesn't relate to physical healing that doesn't relate to matters of a a sin-sick soul but relates to things that we've experienced whether joy or whether relationships there's a restoration a redemption and we look to christ to accomplish any of those things and so i those those are some of the things i've been pondering and i just felt the lord dealt with my heart to speak on this even as a foundation that we could point back to that if we're going to be believing for restoration or redemption or a miracle our faith has to be in the right things brother braham says if our faith is set right and in the right position it gives a constant satisfaction that's what i want i want a constant satisfaction i don't necessarily even want something that's just up and down and up and down and i'm and i'm i'm just always in this valley and looking forward to a mountaintop but i want something constant and steady and so if my faith is set right and in the right position so i'm in the right position and i'm oriented correctly my attitude is correct then it gives a constant satisfaction so this is a reorientation of our faith this is checking our attitude and our altitude to make sure that we're going in the right direction and we're traveling in the right trajectory now continue on this subject of faith and the foundation here romans chapter 4 verse 14 says for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect now in the context that he's speaking of there's a lot more that should be shared if you're wanting to amplify the point that he's saying about they that be of the law if you're saying if you're solely those that keep the law and those that adhere to the law were made inherited and received the promise or were heirs he says there's avoiding of faith that faith is nullified faith is is not even relevant does not play a factor and he says and the promise is made of not effect so faith if faith is rendered useless then the word cannot be effective in this instance he's saying that if it's if it's by the works of the law if it's merely in the keeping of something then we have no need of faith and if you have no need of faith then the promise can be of no effect so wherever faith is rendered useless the word of god cannot be effective and this is an important principle for us to always always remember that if we if we see a promise in the word of god and we and it doesn't come to pass the problem problem is not with the promise the problem the problem is never the word the word is perfect the problem can be our faith towards the word or it could be our understanding of the promise that we could be misunderstanding the promise well the bible says this the word of god says that so that means this and our problem is the conclusion or the assumptions that we're making but it's never the seed of the word of god the word of god is perfect it is pure and so when when faith is rendered void is this faith is made void and faith being made void the promise is made of none effect it's no longer effective then this is then we want to always remember that our faith has to be set right in the right position towards the word of god in order for the word to be effective on us jesus says in mark chapter 7 verse 13 that they had made the word of god and he makes this statement a couple places or it's written differently by the different apostles making the word of god of not effect through your tradition so the word of god though it is effective though it has power though it has life though there was a promise attached to honor thy father and thy mother and and if you do this you'll have long days upon the earth he's saying the word of god was made of no effect it was not effective did not produce the desired result through tradition so tradition can intervene and change the effectiveness of the promise of god it says in matthew chapter 13 verse 58 about christ he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief it's not because christ wasn't capable of mighty works it's not because they weren't uh they didn't need mighty works but rather unbelief hindered the mighty works from being made manifest so paul says that when faith is made void the promises of none effect jesus is saying that traditions could have so much preeminence to where the power of the word of god is of none effect and now jesus was unable to perform mighty works because of unbelief even in hebrews chapter 3 as we've been reading that ourselves personally and pondering the rest that god has left for the elect says so we see that they could not enter in enter into rest because of unbelief the rest was there it was available it was even promised to them and god's saying hey come on enter into rest but they couldn't because of their own unbelief there was something in their confidence in their trust and their understanding that was keeping them from entering into rest and it was unbelief at the root of it unbelief that kept mighty works from being done unbelief that causes the word of god to be of none effect so avoided faith produces an ineffective promise when our faith is made void a promise cannot be effective now this is one of a couple principles i'm wanting to use in the beginning to establish i'm going to mention it here just a moment about i'm wanting just to preface it by saying there's a couple principles that i'm trying to lay in a foundation to come to a few scriptures to point out something and it's just going to be a very uh short sermon in one sense very directed very focused to build our faith so i don't i'm not planning on uh just plodding along and laying in a lot of things but just i want to make this statement here for talking about faith being avoided and this requires just some uh amp amplifying on my part and i'm just not sure how to express this but we ought to never use a part of the word to weaken the faith that we have in another part of the word and it sounds by the response it sounds like um i made more of this in my mind than i should have because in my mind i'm thinking this is such a big thing i've really got to be able to express this but if we have faith in a particular promise of god and we feel that this faith is rising i believe this i believe this for me and then we find somewhere else in the word of god another promise another statement something else another principle or even another circumstance of the scripture we should never let that work against the work with this in a way to weaken our faith in it so if we have faith in the word of god for something then no other part of the word of god can if placed properly weakened the faith you have in another promise i'm believing the promise of the scripture that says this shall be and then you read another scripture that says and this shall be that should not weaken the faith that you have in the promise of god so don't let faith in a promise become void because you have some sort of carnal interpretation of another promise because when you do that you make the word compete against the word it's word versus word well the word of god says that this is gonna happen but the word of god says this is gonna happen and we use it in such a way to say well god says it's gonna rain in the morning but the word of god says it won't rain in the morning and you can't get it that way you can't make them compete to decrease your faith the lord taught me a huge lesson one time about fleecing i prayed and i asked the lord if you want me to do something then when it hadn't rained for some time i believe and i said lord if you want me to uh i can't remember which whether we were in a drought or monsoon season or non-soon whatever it was i was living in texas at the time so there's no monsoons there but this was as a very very young christian i pray lord if you if you want me to do something then um then let it let it not be raining in the morning and i think it had been raining for some time and i woke up it was just dry and i was like well there you go fell back to sleep woke up raining cats and dogs well then which one is it you know which one do i go by and you'll find that fleecing is generally not a very good uh it's not a principle that you flip through your bottom we find everywhere i read i'm told to fleece i've told the fleece no you need to understand the context of the fleecing because you can fleece in a way to where you're you're asking god to compete against his promises and so you want to use a wisdom and how that you pray wisdom how you approach a promise because we cannot make the word compete against the word the bible says in john chapter 1 verse 12 but as many as received him and i'm going to use this as an example but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name so the promise is that if you receive him and believe on his name then you are given power to become the sons of god then we ought to believe that that promise is true and then have faith that if i receive him he will give me power by my faith in him to become a son of god but then when we read in john chapter 6 verse 64 it says but there are some of you that believe not we ought not to reason with that and say well then i guess that might be me because the bible says there's some that believe not don't take your faith in the promise that says you are that you are healed or you're sealed or you're saved or you are delivered there's a promise that you're believing and then read another scripture and say well i guess maybe this means i might not be because then you're taking this faith that you have in one part of the word of god and then you're actually starting to project it incorrectly towards another promise and you have divided you've divided your faith in a way to where you're causing you're letting a misinterpretation of the word of god a misplacing of faith in another promise of god weaken your faith in another promise the bible says jesus says i will not leave you comfortless but i will come to you that's a promise that you can believe it you can believe in the promise of comfort it's replete through the new testament god is there to comfort you the comfort of scripture the comfort of one another the comfort of the holy ghost but then you can't read other places that say well the believer is going to go through hard trials and if you're not suffering you're not being made perfect and read all these other scriptures to conclude well i guess i must not have comfort or must not deserve comfort or the promise of comfort must not be for me you're making the word of god compete it's word versus word and you can't do that if he made you a promise of comfort that means he has promised to be there as a comforter through your suffering through your trials through your adversities through your difficulties and you can take the same faith that causes you to believe that there absolutely will be comfort and cause it to remain strong when you believe that i will endure suffering so it's amazing it's a matter of us allowing the word of god in one place to weaken our faith in a promise of god and if we do that there must be a misunderstanding if we believe in very strongly for something and then we read another statement we hear another verse we we listen to the word preached and it causes us to we our faith to be weakened then either we have not heard the word or you misunderstand the word which you have heard so never let the word of god compete with itself election does not work against grace predestination does not work against faith these are things that harmonize and they work together one part doesn't cancel out the other part well faith without works is dead so then you have to have works but it doesn't cancel out faith faith without works is dead so you have to have works you have to have fruits of the spirit it's you have to do this but it doesn't cancel out um election he said it's god it's neither him nor willeth or him that runeth but god that showeth mercy but it doesn't nullify your will and you're running some of us read that and say well i'm not going to want and i'm not going to run and that's a misinterpretation of saying if you're running and if you're willing it doesn't matter if god doesn't show mercy so the word one part promise doesn't void out another promise of god in the sense that it nullifies it makes it ineffective or declares that it's not true so when god makes a promise this is a very elementary way of expressing this when god makes a promise we accept it by faith and if we've accepted a promise by faith then we patiently wait for it that's all that we're asked to do if we if we accept god makes a promise then we accept it by faith and then we can say then i believe that the promise is mine in luke chapter 24 verse 49 here's an example of a promise and then what the what you must do and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so he says i the promise i'm going to send the promise so terry it means sit settle until the promise comes when the promises are made then stay fixed stand fast stand as paul says stand there for him and you're standing firm in the promise you're believing when god makes a promise accepted by faith and stand steady if he promises that he'll put a sword in your hand supernaturally and he says if you just keep your hand out i'll drop a sword in your hand then you just accept it by faith and you keep your hand out and you don't start getting impatient saying well maybe i should run to the thrift store and buy a sword no keep your hand out he made a promise so in acts chapter 1 verse 4 it says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem so now the disciples and those 120 are gathered together in jerusalem according to the promise they say so that god told them the promise is to you i will send it but terry in jerusalem until so they have this promise until so now the scripture describes their obedience to that promise they've been assembled together and they wait for the promise of the father which saith he you have heard of me and in bibles that capture the sayings of jesus in the red letter the wait for the promise of the father is in red and then ye have heard of me is in red so these are the words of jesus that they're obeying he said that he would send the promise of the father so we've got to go to jerusalem and wait until the time of the fulfilling of the promise so hearing the promise hearing the promise of god hearing the promise from jesus excited of faith that brought them into obedience and under expectation he said to go to jerusalem wait so what did they do they were excited to go to jerusalem and wait and now they're under anticipation of the promise we made this statement of brother branham's a few times recently every man that has ever had the spiritual revealed truth of the will of god makes preparation for the fulfillment if you ever have the spirit the truth of the word of god spiritually revealed to you then you make ready for the promise whatever that is you make preparation you put yourself in position to benefit from it so every man that has had the truth of god spiritually revealed to them makes proud rape makes preparation and readies them to receive it and so there's a confidence that comes it's an expectation of faith that that as i said is bringing us under expectation or this is faith that brings us under expectation so it's confident and it's an expectation that's very if i i tried to think of a way just to describe it it's anxious but it's patient it's under it's it's eager it's under eager anticipation but it's at rest it's like i can't wait it's coming this is gonna this is gonna be great and uh and i guess maybe like my children whenever they get excited it's just for elliot doesn't do it very much anymore but boom boom boom boom boom boom and you know they're just jumping up and down in place and it's just really really it's like hey what are you so excited about and so in some ways maybe maybe we're kind of doing the same thing we're not running around but inside our faith is going boing boing boing boing it's coming chick-fil-a's coming we're gonna get it and you're all really really excited because you just believe so it's an eager anticipation but it's confident in that rest it's not are you joking are you for real is this serious but it's something just so knows it's going to happen so there's this eager anticipation that comes paul when writing about a promise that is being waited for that you believe absolutely in he says in romans chapter 8 verse 24 but if we hope for that we for that we see not so if you believe for something and you don't see it then he says then we then do we with patience wait for it if you have real hope according to a promise if you have if you've been by faith believe a promise is coming then faith births a hope an expectation an earnest expectation that you will see it so if you have not received it then there still has to be a hope and expectation that it's going to come so then you do with patience wait for it when god makes a promise you accept it by faith and then we patiently wait for the fulfillment the receiving of the promise now i want to i would love to and by god's grace maybe we'll have the opportunity to spend more time on this subject but there's the wrong kind of hope there's a dark side of hope if we could put it that way that can actually work against your realization of or the the acceptance of the promise actually receiving of the promise the fulfillment of the promise of god in your life can be hindered through the wrong kind of hope brother man makes the statement just a few times but he's identifying a carnal hope and a carnal attitude which we cannot confuse for faith or scriptural hope that is joined with faith and charity but a carnal kind of hope that actually is an enemy to faith and he says it this way little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy faith has if there's a sister hope here today we we know exactly what he's talking about we're not talking about little sister hope over there she's so sweet and timid and she's like i didn't know i was the greatest enemy to faith why did you name me hope but little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy faith has that's right and could you imagine twin sisters one named faith one named hope and faith is over the one you got that right that's right the greatest enemy faith's got is hope because a person that becomes so hopeful be till they leave away from faith brother branham is not he doesn't spend a lot of time amplifying what this means but he's saying that he characterizes the timidity the the this this uh uh little timid hope who seems lovely and sweet but someone gets so hopeful to actually leave and away from faith because faith is what burley she has hair on her chest all right wait for using she but if faith is burly it's strong it's got muscles it's got hair on its chest that's what faith is and then you have this little timid hope and so someone becomes so hopeful they're projecting all their energy into the hope and faith is over saying this is really what you should use to bring this promise to pass he said you put so much in your hope until you get away from faith so there's a dark side to hope this wrong kind of hope it's fragile it's actually easily unraveled and and this kind of hope is easily manipulated and so there's a wealth of of principles that we could dive into to actually begin to identify how that our base human instincts when we're relying on a hope that that can be used to manipulate behavior can be used to string people along and it can actually be used to cause people to acquiesce and become more complacent and to back away in brother branham's identifying this this is in the early 50s he calls hope little and timid and now there's volumes and volumes of studies that are beginning to show that there's this dark side of hope to where it can be easily manipulated easily unraveled and actually causes people to no longer be proactive and no longer act and do the things that they ought to do all because of hope brother branham said it's little and timid so it's fragile it's insecure but faith hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so if you have faith in something somebody can ask you for the proof and your faith is the proof where where is the where is the substance of your joy it's in my faith where is the evidence that you're healed my faith is the evidence literally is something we should take literally faith is the substance it is the the grasping the holding it to you is as good as the real thing it is the substance of things hoped for so if you are hoping for a body change your faith that there will be a body change is the substance of your body change because how are you ever going to get there through faith so it becomes the substance of it if you're believing for healing you're believing for something but yet you have not seen it your faith is the evidence of it therefore having faith you do not doubt even though you don't see it with these eyes some say well it's never going to happen so i'm going to sorry i've already got the faith you've come too late i've already seen the evidence if we use the scenario the example of the the spies that entered into the promised land when they went over and they brought back the grapes and they carried this on their shoulders you could say they could say that they had the evidence that this was in the land and nobody could say and you'll notice the ten spies did not say well there's no fruit there and there's no nice grapes and this isn't there they couldn't do that because they'd already what brought back the evidence and so those the evidence stood that they could have confidence that the land was exactly as god said it would be and what did they have to do well yeah but there's these giants in the land and there's this and there's that and just as god said that there's enemies there there's enemies there and then they take the truth that there's enemies and they use it to work against the truth that god said i've given it to you faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen in the message third exodus brother brahma says now to you sick people oh how i'd like to drive this home when you catch that faith that you're going to be healed every circumstance everything else all signs all symptoms can point that you are dying and you'll never move its resting place is in the sanctuary of god's word faith when you get the faith that you're going to be healed no circumstance diagnosis symptom conditions certainly they can all point to your dying but it won't move you from the faith he says it's resting places in the sanctuary of god's word when faith genuine faith sets itself there not make believe now faith not hope but faith hope is out here hoping it was so hope is something external may if i a and not having the benefit of seeing what he's pointing to we know that he refers to another places how there's a way where you're on the outside looking in and then on the inside looking out there's something external it's not in the soul realm but maybe it's in your imagination conscience memory reason and affection or what you can see so you have this hope that may be a good report maybe a change in circumstance i'm hoping that tomorrow when i wake up i'll hear get an email from this and there's this hope that something out here is gonna happen and that's what hope has to do is it doesn't have any strength within itself so it's looking for confirmation it's looking for affirmation it's looking for something to make it feel good about itself because it's little and timid in me but faith is over there saying i'm the evidence of it i'm the substance of it doesn't need doesn't need the email in the morning it doesn't need the reference doesn't need the the affirmation it is the affirmation itself so he said faith he says hope is what is on the outside out here hoping it was in faith is already in looking out and saying it's done it's done it's done it's done it's done it's done that's faith faith is saying it's done hope is going well i don't know i mean maybe and my yeah yeah i don't know right little timid hope but faith is over it's done it's done it's done got bad news it's done got more bad news it's done got more good news i told you it's done but then we got bad news well it's done it's finished it's saying it's done that's faith that's what faith that is where faith takes its resting place for it knows that god will never never let the enemy right over the top of him praise the lord he never has he never will faith knows and so it rests in the word of god now this this is where maybe i'm working within this um uh maybe working to the second point as i said we should never let one word of god compete with another word of god this is maybe unfolding this a little bit more but kind of a second point this hope this wrong kind of hope creates tension with our faith by establishing certain parameters his brother and says if hope is out here hoping it was in so there's a hope well could it be this could it be that since it's not faith hope works to establish certain a framework or certain circumstances or conditions parameters for god to work within so hope becomes a mental bias i hope it's this way i hope this happens i hope i hope and so it begins to establish a way that you expect it to happen in the way that you want it to be so this hopeful mind that brother branham identifies it's what hinders faith and it's a human it's a human mind it's a it's an assuming mind it's one that kind of creates these scenarios uh scenario creating and and all these assumptions and well if this is gonna happen that's gonna happen and it's like prognosticating and predicting well if this is what it's going to be then that's going to have to happen if this is going to happen this is going to have to happen and we get it all figured out in our minds right well if god's going to do that then this is going to have to happen and then that's going to have to happen and this is going to have to happen and that's going to have to happen and we go back and we look through all these different things and even though we're saying i believe that this is going to happen hope begins to think about all the moving pieces that are going to have to somehow fit together and we start looking at all that yeah i know he said this is going to happen but look at all this other stuff and so our carnal expectation and this is how the hopeful mind binds us because it's a it's a human thinking it's a mental bias our carnal expectations the thoughts you form as a human being are bound by language time and distance now i'll just throw the caveat there out there the qualifier these are this is just my way of trying to make sense of it i don't have any authority necessarily we know brother branham talks about the dimensions we live in not light time and matter those are the three dimensions we live within light time and matter so there's distance there's substance there's things that we relate to but as we begin to talk about things and we describe things or we form in our hearts and our minds things that we want to do just as a natural person if you're going to make plans well i want to go on vacation or i want to go buy a car or i want to do this we can only understand it in terms of language and we can only begin to process what has happened what's happening and what will happen by this language time in space distance if i say that i'm going to walk to the back of the room then you would expect you understand my intention by my language and then you would begin to recognize that this intent is being fulfilled as i cover distance during a particular time frame and you would expect well brother ann's going to walk to the back of the room you'd begin to formulate this idea well how long do you think it would take and say well it might take him five seconds to do it it really depends on how how fast he walks and so you kind of begin to understand things in the sense that you can immediately begin to say well if he's coming walking to the back of the room then that's just going to be maybe a few seconds it's the same thing when people say hey um can you come over i need some help say yeah i'm on my way you immediately begin to think that they've left they live about 15 minutes away so i can expect them in 20 minutes and really what they meant is i am now formulating the thought of leaving right and let me just say this i'm going to do all of you a favor today let's get in the habit of just being honest about when we left and how far away we are because we get this pride i don't want them to know i left 10 minutes late so they text say are you going to be here on time you're like i'm just going to be five minutes late and you've already left 15 minutes late just say you know what i left 15 minutes late i'm looking at 20 minutes maybe and all of a sudden and they'll be going yes we needed 20 more minutes right just be honest about it if you can get in the habit of being honest about things that really at the end don't matter then the payoff is going to be when you need to be honest about things that count like really count so always be in the habit of telling the truth always been the habit of being honest and so this is just one of those ways where i just wanted us to think in terms of when someone says something we begin to understand what's happening in terms of space activity things taking place language time and distance so we think in terms of and this is where i i want to make this relevant to what i'm speaking on this morning we think in terms of a process so there's a difference between non-linear thinking and linear thinking in terms of problem solving and working through things and i'm not wanting to delve into creative thinking versus linear thinking but we are all in some way by the our base logic and human experience we are linear thinking thinkers in that we think in a step-by-step progression or we we act in a step-by-step progression now we can we can identify times in our lives where we don't think through things like oh yeah i should have done that first duh but yet we when we're thinking about things we typically are maybe generally described as a think in terms of step by step where one thing follows another if we're going to wash our clothes we take them off first before we put them in the laundry the washing machine that's just how we think we don't think well how am i going to fit in here we think logically step by step this is how you do it and so this is what this is how our minds work and i'm only bringing this up so i can identify something about our human minds we think in terms of a process and we know that process takes time that we so we think we think in this way of step-by-step progression we think in terms of process and so we think chronologically that when things happen things move along in time that if i said at 11 15 i was going to walk to the back of the room you would not expect for me to arrive at 11 14. because you think no matter how fast brother aaron can walk he's going to be walking forward in time that's how you can wake up at a at ten o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock in the morning and get to church at seven o'clock in the morning because you woke up an hour late because you lived in an eastern time zone and your your phone was wrong can i get an amen it happened to happen to me today my alarm went off like man seven o'clock came early well somehow someway google's not smart enough to figure out that i've lived in arizona for the last six months got me in some other time zone and the my cell phone that i bought when i didn't live in arizona didn't uh it it sprang forward in time so i was waking up at what i thought was seven but it was actually six and i i just felt so early i just dismissed it there's not going to be a snooze so when we finally woke up i told elizabeth we're running late and then we looked at the clock we're like oh my goodness this can't be right surely we're not running this late and she says yes we are don't call me shirley and then we realize no something's wrong here somewhere the time's not right and so even though you can uh theoretically maybe on a clock mess with the time zone to where now it's it's i've moved forward in time and haven't lost an hour of my life we know logically that things move forward in time things progress you say well let's go on a road trip you're immediately going to try to understand that in terms of when are we leaving how far are we driving where are we going to stay because it's something that covers distance and as you drive it passes time we ask a distinction in question sometimes how how far away is it and someone says it's 10 minutes like no i want to know how far it is i want to know the distance not the time other time you say how far away is it it says well it's 12 miles no i don't want to know the distance i want to know the time because that's the way we think to get the full picture now with that in mind and i think maybe i spent a little bit too much time on that then i wanted to but now that we're really thinking we're we're conscious of this human mechanism that we think in terms of step-by-step progression uh and process and then we think in terms of the passage of time there's things in our lives that we had openly meant we just say well things take time and there's things that we say well it's a process and we understand that by virtue of human nature then we look to things in the word of god and we realize that god gave abraham a promise and he waited 25 years for it to happen so then we begin to realize that even when it comes to the word of god i don't want to be mr impatient because if he gave abraham the promise and he waited 25 years then i believe 25 years then we say well remember noah god made a promise to noah he waited a hundred years and so we have these instances where we have a rebuke to mr impatient because we realize well when god makes a promise he's going to fulfill it and so then to try to understand why we haven't received the promise we could recognize that things do take time and it is a process with respect to the new birth we understand that there is stages steps or a process of the new birth and we would describe as a process of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and when we think of the new birth and then we think it's a process of justification sanctification and the baptism of holy ghost it's impossible for us to not think of it in terms of time it's impossible to say well the new birth is comprised of three elements justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and it's impossible for us to begin to think about that any in eternal realm because when we think that jesus christ died for our sins and we try to get the full scope of that we go back to the beginning and we begin to think about this process and abraham and to him the promise was made and it comes all the way up and then jesus christ is born as a baby in the manger and here he is he's got a baby that's born to die and then he's baptized by john it's the washing and you go through all these different steps of the lamb coming to a place to be sacrificed so when we think about jesus christ dying for our sins which accomplishes our justification which accomplishes our sanctification which made way for the baptist the holy ghost then we think in terms of chronology in terms of a process but yet in the word of god the lamb slain before the foundation of the world i mean it's done i mean it was already it was already done finished and sealed but yet so it's impossible for us to think about a promise and not begin to try to relate to it in terms of time so we take we take the concept of time and distance which is natural to our thinking our thought process and then and then the process and then what we do we process the promise of god through these natural processes we take the concept of time and distance and then we take a promise and then we process we look at the process of the promise and we run it through natural process now we do it through our own experience and this is where i could just say that when brother man says the way with experience is the plumb line people experience certain things and they receive a promise and then they take the template of their experience and they try to make everybody fit within their template of their experience in order to benefit from the word they benefited from why because they've taken their experience away with experience as the plumb line if god says something's going to happen and somebody else went through a different process to get it our faith is in the promise that said it was going to happen not the process they went through to get it listen i don't want my faith to be made perfect in the same way that abrahams was where he asked me to sacrifice my son but i do know that i will go through a process for it to be made perfect but i don't want to take the template of noah the template of abraham the template of somebody else and say well i guess i've got to go through this in order to get it away with experience as the plumb line you know what's amazing about a lot of people that create these arbitrary carnalistic temp templates for you to fit within and this mold for you to fit within in order for you to get something and then you take that and say oh well that's interesting show me when you did it and they're like oh well um i'm the one speaking you listen to me i'm the one asking the questions and you immediately realize they don't even follow their own advice they haven't been washed according to the same parameters that they expect you to be watched they don't they're not asking you they haven't done the same thing they're asking you to do listen one thing we know about god he practices what he preaches and so we could take this concept and then of of time and distance and process the promise through these processes think about in terms of healing we read james chapter 5 verse 14. what it says call the elders anoint with oil and it says the prayer of faith will save the sick it says it so if you're going to take your faith in the promise to call the elders then you need to call an elder call the elders they need to come anoint you with oil lay hands on you and pray for you so immediately we're thinking in terms of me benefiting and i'm not saying this thought process isn't in any way wrong because we haven't figured out us elders or whoever the elders are haven't figured out time travel there you have to bring them by language ask them to come by activity they travel through time and space to where you are to accomplish this act of anointing with oil and praise so that's how we process the promise of healing according to james 5. even according to mark chapter 16 verse 18 you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we think in terms of identifying the sick laying our hands on them praying there's a process this is what we do with the promises of god but let me say this now as we turn this corner these promises that we see in james 5 and mark 16 even the truth of the new birth being a process these promises must not be used to create an arbitrary barrier to god fulfilling his word that we read in james 5 we read in mark 16. we read this we hear this we cannot carnally take the building blocks of the word of god to create a wall that we say that god can't cross over in order to fulfill his promise we're just constructing a maze well if god's going to heal me he's going to have to come this way and we're just looking for around the mountain when he comes right because he'll be coming around the mountain when he comes and says you know what god said he's going to get around the mountain under the mountain over the mountain he just told me he's coming so i'm not going to be looking around the mountain when he comes i'm just looking for him to come i haven't said which way he's coming i'm not looking to an angle and if i see something coming around the mountain well it's the wrong side god he said he's come and i'm looking for him to come this is how the promise works we cannot use other promises in the word of god to create some kind of random carnal arbitrary circumstance that god has to meet in order for you to receive the promise because god's word should never be weaponized against another part of the word should never say in this corner john 3 16 and in this corner john 6 64. eight rounds of championship unbelief boxing and have the word duke it out turn the ufc into ultimate faith championship and have word fighting against word which one's going to win we're going to have divine healing versus just contentment god's word should never be weaponized against another promise of god should never be used to limit god's power well i know the word says this but did you know the word says this and do it as a way to water it down or average it out now i would say that most of us would never do it that way or maliciously we wouldn't do it with our hands on our hip with an attitude and snapping our fingers and moving our neck but we would we would do it innocently we wouldn't do it maliciously we would do it even without realizing it let me use an example for you in the example of the the baptism of the holy ghost the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost is a promise that is clearly stated in the word of god if you read your bible the promise is there if you're a believer of the message of the hour the promise is clearly there in acts chapter 2 verses 38 to 39 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call whether you're the far off you're at least the as many as the lord our god shall call now this is the promise of god but these are the comp this is the competition now where we want the promise of acts 2 38 and 39 promise is very clear but now we begin to throw up the the competition and the opponents to this luke chapter 24 verse 49 jesus said to go into jerusalem and tarry until you're endued with power from on high we read action chapter 1 verse 4 where it says they were told to wait and so we take luke chapter 24 we take acts chapter 1 we take the very logistics and the actual physical circumstances of the disciples in that time and we say well they were all in one accord they were all doing the same thing they were all like this and and we have to we begin to create this scenario where if everyone could just be doing the same thing at the same time and we have this whole thing kind of figured out and lined up because that's how it happened on the day of pentecost and what are we doing we've taken the promise of acts 2 38 and we start either running up qualifiers or opponents yeah he says the promise that you should do this repent be baptized and you shall receive the gifts of the holy ghost but acts chapter 1 has something to say about it it doesn't make much sense when i describe it that way does it but this is how the carnal mind begins to play a gi joe with the promises of god we arbitrarily then and i say arbitrarily because it's not rooted in some actual scriptural process thought process we establish a time frame for god this isn't like a vision where a prophet has a vision that something happens and he sees a hat on the dresser he sees someone sitting here he sees someone sitting there and he knows in the vision all these things have to line up for it to be brought to pass we're saying the word of god says do this and you shall and then we start saying oh but wait a minute wait a minute you got to do this and you got to do that all of a sudden you got a bunch of hoops and getting the holy ghost becomes the olympics brother says god's under obligation if your faith is right towards god to give you the holy ghost the minute that you obey his word think about that this is not just one statement i dug up in in 47 to 65 where he never says anything like this and i spent the last week trying to find the one to make my point god's under obligation if your faith is right towards god to give you the holy ghost the minute that you obey his word brother man consistently teaches that the seal is a confirmation of your faith not your works so then what but what the weakness is our flesh begins to construct parameters and timelines and the framework that god has to operate within and what happens we say well if i didn't speak with the tongues i don't have the holy ghost if i didn't speak with tongues then i don't have the holy ghost and use that to put god in a box and say i don't have the holy ghost because i didn't speak in tongues now we can all admit that that would be an unscriptural framework that we're trying to demand that god work within in order to confirm to us that we have the holy ghost but that's the way the human mind works we take statements and quotes and certain things to judge and to condemn ourselves or even others when it comes to these things brother brahm says in the message israel in the church part 1 people say let's have a tearing meeting glory to god let's go back and say glory to god let's carry for the holy ghost he says there's no such thing terry doesn't mean pray terry means wait he says this and he teaches this that there's no such thing as tarrying meetings to get the holy ghost in other words you can't set up a stop watch and say what we're going to do is we're going to pray until such time that the holy ghost is going to fall and seal us and this is how we're going to do it this is how we're going to go about it but i said there's no such thing to that terry doesn't mean that you have to pray and pray and reach some kind of threshold where you have over in the corner you have a volume meter right let's see how loud the congregation's getting the needle's like you're almost there keep shouting keep shouting getting loud louder saints louder and louder boom we're right but that's exactly what people are currently doing they've got a crowd meter in the back hey guys hey we need we need more get that dun dun dun dun dun people start whirling around and cheering and going crazy it's the carnal metrics it's the framework in which we think god has to work brother brother branham says this and believeth thou this every man and woman here every man and woman here who has a need of god can receive it right now do you believe that how many believes with all your heart he says if you have a need you can receive it right now so he says you sinners and people seek in the holy ghost here's what the holy ghost is friends you that's seeking it you don't have to seek and beg and tarry it's right with you now you say well we need a tarian meeting terry means wait not pray and i could say this with absolute assurance this is a question in your heart this is a question that people wrestle with this is something people want settled they want to stop asking themselves so they can go forward in the grace of god do i have the holy ghost do i have the holy ghost have i been born again have i done this have i done that and they've got to have this settled i'm saying that god has heard you you say are you talking to all of us i'm talking to somebody god has heard the cry of your heart and he's confirming to you his promise and he's establishing your faith to believe for the right things because god starts to do something in our lives and we begin to experience the benefit of the holy ghost and god is accomplishing many many wonderful things and then the devil sometimes just wants to take us out of out of line like well let's go all the way back here and let's just ask are you even really in it and why because as he's dragging us back he's going did you see this this church you went to and that situation you're in and you went through this and you went through that in this difficulty and he's trying to bring us back to get us back in line waiting for a promise when we were standing right there with it to begin with it's the way the mind works god is under obligation to give it to you the minute you obey there's no such thing as tarrying meetings praying and begging and you don't have to seek begging terry in one place he says if you've been seeking the holy ghost for years he says i'm not scolding you but he says you're either mistaught you don't understand or there's something wrong so if there's a listen if someone's been seeking the holy ghost fears if someone's known the message for years if someone has been witness to if there's a situation in someone's life and we could say and they could admit i don't have the holy ghost brother branham doesn't say well then you just must not be elect he goes no no no no if you knew there was a promise and you haven't got it for years you either been taught wrong or you've misunderstood correct teaching or something's wrong in your heart something's wrong somewhere and he's not suggesting you may not be seen we could say that clearly the elect cannot be quickened but we're not dealing in the realms of of the the non-elect we're talking about the elect we're talking about you this morning that god speaks to and deals with we're talking about the promise of god who's under as many as the lord our god shall call if something's not happening and there's something that hasn't taken place then we don't take one part of the word to speak against another part of the promise of god we just take the word of god to begin to examine our hearts to put our faith in a place to receive it exact chapter 10 verse 44 while peter yet spake these words this is acts chapter 10 okay not acts chapter 1 chapter 2 verse 38 and 39 it's while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word while he's preaching the word they received the word and the holy ghost fell on them that believed the word and if you say well you know they had been baptized already in the name of lord jesus christ no if you keep reading he says which one of you will forbid them from being baptized in christian baptism sin they've already received the holy ghost we get this structure in our mind this has to happen this has to happen for that that happened and we have this measuring stick we measure everybody by experience well so when were you justified how many years were you sanctified that's not a really long time don't you think you should have been sanctified a lot longer than i mean three years some people are giggling other people are going you know what that's exactly how people are in other words as peter yet preached the word the holy ghost fell on them which heard the word there was no more terry until there was no magical timeline if your objection is but what about the process what about the process no what about the promise it's god's promise therefore it's god's process don't take god's promise and try to work it down and shoehorn it into some sort of physical carnal personal process like i remember it's got to happen this way god made the promise lord i yield to your process you made the promise you fulfill your promise brother brown says three elements and that's the elements we go through when we are born again justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost let's all say it together now that can all be in one act hallelujah when are we thinking about a change something happening something taking place in someone's heart my heart another person's heart whoever's heart it may be let's not begin to get out our calendars and say honey did you buy a day minder for 2025 because as i looked at this process i think this is about the time we're going to see god fulfill his promise the process of justification sanctification baptism all he goes can all be in one moment that's brother branham's statement that's what we see happening in the scripture so in acts chapter 2 verses 1 to 4 when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all in one accord in one place why because god said this was the promise you've got to go to jerusalem and you've got to wait until god had established a time frame god said it had to be on the day of pentecost which was a jewish feast holiday now we think the day of pentecost is the day that they finally all crossed hands just right they were sitting in a circle is it kumbaya maybe it's kumbaya no let's we tried that for a few days let's try michael row your boat ashore give us the key of g michael rowe and and we're all just holding hands and we've got this perfect instagramable indie worship scene going and then the holy ghost falls against our bead board and farm uh barriers that we've put up all around us and our chicken baling wire and all of a sudden the lord starts moving in a really dynamic way because it was just this perfect scene that we had created no god said it's got to be on the day of pentecost that's when the promises kind of come you got to wait until that day once that day came there never was another day on the calendar that a believer had to wait for to get it today is the day of salvation not a another day of pentecost not another date on the calendar once that happened the calendar was destroyed every age brother bram said it is the age of the holy ghost to the true believer there wasn't one age where they were just justified there wasn't just another age where they were just sanctified every age every day every minute every moment is the day of salvation for the elect so when the day of pentecost was fully come not their works they were all in one accord in one place according to the promise their faith in brahman and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance the wait was over the day of pentecost should come the wait was over that's why it says while peter yet spake these words suddenly the holy ghost fell upon them that believed why once the day of pentecost was fully come suddenly they could now walk into the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost there's no more word set time period for the believer to get the holy ghost suddenly there came it's immediately quickly and unexpectedly it came suddenly it happened it wasn't it was this at one point we could say according to the promise jesus said if he could have articulated the whole promise to them you need to go to jerusalem and you got to wait until the day of pentecost fully comes and then it's the prom then then this is going to happen then we could have said well we got 30 days we got 29 there could have been a counting down but god gave them the word that they needed to receive in order to be the in the right kind of frame of mind to receive the promise when it was time so he said terry and wait and they knew that's what the word of god said so they did what the word said now that the wait is over he says believe believe and so the word wants to put us in the right frame of mind to receive the promise so he's not giving us the back story he's not trying to give us everything else to take he's not giving us everybody else's experience it's something that happens suddenly and that's why i asked the question why not now if it's now while the peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell if the promise is in the word of god without some sort of time frame or barrier then why not now he said well what do you refer to healing salvation deliverance restoration redemption somebody could be despairing over some circumstance in their life that's existed for dozens of years and you say well if this has been this way for this long then it's going to take a long time to fix it i'm saying why not now why not right now and so before i go to want to do this kind of like a runway of just going down a bunch of scenarios in the scripture and i had to pare it down from dozens to just a few what kind of arbitrary limits have you been placing on god in your life in other words god makes a promise and you say but this but this but this but this and we often say we put god in a box how many have said that we put god in a box but really let's just be real you can't put god in a box who have we put in the box your faith yourself god's saying hey i i own the cattle of a thousand years i'm the god of creation i'm the one who the lover of your soul i've made the promise come ask of me be bold come speak to me i'm your father i'll give you good things come and ask like um when you need me i'll just be in my box here yes and we shut the door and we put ourselves in the box and god's like hey come out enjoy the promises of god what kind of limits have we placed what kind of man-made barriers are holding you back from the promise i tell you i'm inspired and anointed by the spirit of god this morning to take a bunch of man-made berries and destroy them for the last time in people's lives that they no longer let the intimidation and the threats and the walls and the barriers and the complexes and the false doctrines hold you back from receiving the promise of god that is present here right now be honest about these barriers i've almost been preaching about 45 years here so this morning bear with me in luke chapter 8 verses 43 to 44. and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any all her money was going to doctors all her money was going to ways and treatments and therapies and remedies for 12 years trying to fix it and she came behind him and all she did was touch the border of his garment didn't have to pay for that and immediately her issue of blood staunched 12 years sick 12 000 shekels spent and just the touch of an ordinary garment just a moment she reached out and touched it and immediately it wasn't he didn't stop and say well you've been sick for 12 years and you touched a half inch of my garment and because you didn't touch a foot of my garment it's it's you're going to take a half inch of 12 years it's going to take six years for you to be healed and god just did some kind of math on the spot no it was her faith saved her she touched the hymn of his garment and the bible says suddenly immediately she was healed 12 years a few chapters later in luke chapter 13 verses 11 to 13 and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and couldn't always lift up herself and when jesus saw her he called unto he called her to him and said on her woman thou art loose from the infirmity 18 years bound and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god how what process what process did she go through well first you need to start introducing this into your diet right and then you need to start doing this and you need to buy the royal rife light machine and you start doing ear cones and you start doing this and just prescribe a bunch of things no immediately she was made straight 18 years 12 years 18 this is getting gooder in john chapter 5 verses 5 tonight and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 in eight years he had been sick for 38 years laying there at the pool of bethesda so there was a process when the water stirs if i can be the first one i'll get healed that's the way everyone thought didn't matter how sick you were how long you'd been sick if you could just be the first one in you'll be the one to be healed and i find it interesting i'm in no way criticizing the use of this scripture to inspire people to jump in the pool when the water is being stirred but the literal dynamics of that is if you're not the first one in you're just getting wet do i need to read the whole story at the pool of bethesda when the angel the lord stirred the waters the first one in got healed but the story teaches us that you don't have to get wet to get healed when christ the healer is walking up to you and says i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases take thy bed rise up and walk the stirring of the water was for dispensation it was for time you could use it as a type when the angel lord stirs within the service get your promise but who are we looking to to heal as christ my healer he had been sick for 38 years it says jesus in verse 6 knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith him will thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another step down before me and jesus saith in him rise up now notice he just speaks the word rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole 38 years of an infirmity 38 years of a sickness and immediately he's made whole took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath 12 years 18 years 38 years what are we prone to do say well i've had mine for 39 what are you going to do now brother aaron it doesn't matter to me if it's been your whole life and you're 90. the bible's not establishing timelines that well if you've only been sick 11 years with your blood issue you got to wait 12. oh you you've you've uh you've had this infirmity for 17 years this is the kind where you have to wait 18 years no the bible is saying it doesn't matter how long it can change suddenly in acts chapter 3 we get the gate called beautiful we could read of this story peter james peter and john went up together in the temple at the hour of prayer be in the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb how's that for not 13 years or 18 years or 38 years his whole life well how long his whole life as long as he had ever had life this is a man who'd been sick and lame from birth from day one moment one whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple so here he is he'd been sick his whole life and he's begging alms and what did peter say such as i have i give unto thee silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk i want you to notice this is the word and the mouths of a believer not in the mouth of jesus christ but peter speaking the word and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength why is this so extraordinary it wasn't that just what was wrong was healed but now he had a lifetime of strength to know how to walk a lifetime of coordination when somebody has a stroke they could be 50 years old in the prime of health and then have a stroke and they have to learn to write all over again through therapy day after day after day have to learn how to walk they knew how to walk they have the strength but something is lost but this person didn't need therapy he wasn't scheduled for therapy he wasn't scheduled for this or scheduled that immediately his feet feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with him into the temple walking and leaping and praising god he had a lifetime of strength coordination ability suddenly a man who could never walk could walk like somebody who'd walk their whole lives who could dance who could praise that's the god you serve what is it telling us we should not establish arbitrary limits on god we should not keep putting something off in the future off in the future off in the future i don't get it right now i'll get it right now and if i don't get it this moment i'll get this moment if it doesn't happen this second it happens this second because why with each one this this is the way our mind works it works this way right each second tick tick tick tick tick and so we can believe then that if it didn't happen now now is now now is now then let then be then let now be now and isaiah chapter 53 verse 5 but he was and notice the progression of the language he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and then and with his stripes we are healed even if we could place the the wounding the bruising and the chastising in past tense the healing is present tense god's word is not bound by time and distance the bible says you are healed and it says it in such a way to even if you were to look at the not just using the english language though i'll try to do it now in a moment to help you to understand that even in the way it's written in the hebrew is to create this timeless promise you are healed such that your state now of being healed is your state in past present and future and there's no tense that's being ascribed to it it just is if i can put it this way the promise is always perfectly present we know that within the english language there's three verb tenses to show action i say we know that just kind of paying you a great compliment for listening in elementary school there's three verb tenses that show that of action has been completed we don't know something has been completed he was wounded that's past perfect you could say i had seen it it's something completed in the past if it's future perfect you're using language to suggest that it will happen in the future he will be wounded that's future perfect you say i will have seen it i will have done it but present perfect to say i have seen it it means the action is completed with respect to the present and i would like to use it in the sense to say that the promise of god we are healed i would like to use it just for our english language to say that it is present perfect but i want to take a step further and say the promise is just presently perfect it's perfect right now there's nothing wrong with the promise there's no reason to create a box and go live in it we can just be in the presence of the promise in exodus chapter 3 verse 14 and god said unto moses i am that i am i am that i am he's just saying this i am there's no i was i will be it's just i want you to know that i am so that you don't try to look back you don't try to look forward you just have to recognize me in the present because if you don't see me in the present you're not going to find the true me in the past and you'll never receive the true me in the future if you don't have me in the now he says i am and because he can say i am because he is i can say thus i am because he is you are because as he is in this world so are you this is the promise what he is now presently is what i believe in he is the present god we're not trying to figure out where he's dwelling in our past or future he is a god that can only be present and the promise is just as much god as god is it knows the promise is just as much present it's just presently perfect just as god is present and god is perfect the promise what it says by his stripes we are healed it's not to create this looking back or looking forward but it's to create truth that what i do is i believe that that's what i believe i believe the truth and the truth isn't subject to the chronology the truth isn't subject subject to carnality this is a timeless promise that i believe by his stripes we are healed it's not bound by time in galatians chapter 3 verse 17 and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was 430 years after this is the covenant that was confirmed before god of christ and the law which was 430 years after the covenant so he's actually produced a very interesting time frame you have the covenant confirmed in christ but then he says 430 years after the promise came the law he says if the promise given to abraham that was confirmed in christ was intervened by a law that came 430 years after the law cannot disannul the covenant or the promise that it should be made that it should make the promise of none effect the messiah came they say 1911 years after the promise then the law comes 430 years after the promise in other words god made the promise nothing that intervenes in the meantime can any way disannound the promise even if it's something that happens 430 years later and it's still not yet for another 1500 years that the promise is fulfilled there's no amount of time there's no amount of distance there's no amount of circumstance there's not enough hurt there's not enough pain there's enough circumstances symptoms there's not enough surgeries there's not enough charts there's not enough doctors there's not enough wikipedia there's nothing that can disa no the promise of god nothing that can do it well it's been years it's been years it's been years does it distant all the promise no it doesn't disand all the promise bill graham said god covers all space and fills all time he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he's infinite he's here now just as he says you don't have to beg and tarry and seek it's right with you now oh if i could just get if i could just well if you don't have faith you'll get there and you'll think it's another one it's not faith you'll get there and it's got to be somebody else your rest is in coming to a place where it's the word of god not the building not the man not the zip code not the time zone it's just something where you know it's the word it's the word 430 years cannot disappoint no and make the promise of no effect why because god covers all time and space i wanting to wrap this up so you could see this from a perspective that is god how this is a god that cannot just be broken down into a chronology one of the remarkable things that of many that brother bischo's ministry i believe is uh can teach us is how that when he met with brother branham and brother branham told him he said you had brother biscuit having not shared this with brother brown he had three questions and brother branham told him he says you have three questions brother biscuit never told him he said you have three questions and he's in one of them was about how people could be anointed with the holy ghost but still live a false life and brother brown asked him the question he says have you gotten my tape on the anointed ones have you heard my sermon on the anointed ones and brother branham hadn't preached it for three years what does that teach us that god doesn't have a calendar like we do and he doesn't have a thing of time that runs forward like we do in other words if it was going to be preached in 65 it had already been preached in the mind of god because there's nothing unknown to him waiting for the veil to drop and be like ah schrodinger's cat is there right he's not waiting for something to be opened up to figure out what's there he already knows he's omnipresent he feels all time and space he's omnipotent he's infinite he's here now and i want you to think about this in terms of how the the immediacy bringing to a place to believe without any barriers the bible says and peter writes that a thousand years is one day to god and one day a thousand years if you took time to to to work this out and i went through all these different sticky notes and doing different things and i googled it to confirm my work and one thousand years is equal to a day if you do the math it means one hour is 41 years and eight months because we think well it's going to take time then if from god's perspective what's lasted for 41 years in an hour it's taken care of one minute is nine months one second is four days time doesn't limit god to think that one hour's 41 years and eight months and then every six minutes you can add another four and a half years why not now why not now you spent so many years in this situation so many years to this the marriage is broken and it's been years and years all these different things these scenarios we just have a way of framing it to we're telling god in our minds we think well if this is going to happen it's going to have to take this long but i say why not now we believe in a rapture don't we the bible says it'll happen in a moment the change of our bodies will happen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed suddenly in a moment i say we should believe for that moment i say that we should believe that we're living in the time when it can happen at any moment and not say well this has to happen and that has to happen and this has to happen say god you said it would happen in a moment then if there are circumstances and scenarios that are gonna have to happen let's see if the word says this has to happen that has to happen then god has a way to make it all happen in a moment he can take 41 years worth of things and make him happen in one hour he can take four days worth of stuff and have it happen in one second time is not a barrier to god it can happen suddenly so i say don't let your hope hinder your faith don't cause the word that in some other area a quote a statement a truth don't let it weaken your faith in the word if you're believing that by his stripes we are healed then don't let any other testimony any other narrative any other bible story any other statement any other quote any other experience hinder you from believing he said it i believe it and i'm not going to qualify it when now well it didn't happen oh it's going to happen now well it didn't happen it's going to happen now you have an attitude like that guess what it's when it's going to happen now they they bullied and intimidated that blind man who was claiming his healing i'm healed i'm healed now they're making fun of them go on a day after day i'm healed i was blind i was healed i was prayed for that meeting i was healed and that barber says oh really then how many fingers am i holding up and he goes four tore out of that that barber chair ripped off his the the gown he's like hey i can see i can see why because it never changed when he was healed he was healed right now and as long as he believed it was now he was in a position to be healed but if you always believe it's tomorrow can we have a special tomorrow what is it it's always together now a day away right always if you're going to be healed tomorrow you'll never see tomorrow but if you're healed today you're in a position to receive it the same thing of any promise restoration of broken relationships redemption of something that's lost your joy your peace your physical healing salvation today is the day of salvation why not now why cannot we believe why can't we believe that the promise of god can be fulfilled suddenly in one moment everything can change and that's where the as i was pondering the christ the healer i began to think about certain circumstances and realize in a moment in one moment things can change from night to day just a blink of an eye it's changed and it didn't require sitting down working on a budget thinking through the layers of complexity what am i missing no it's a total moment where god takes control and time doesn't mean anything anymore and suddenly musicians you could come to your places if you'd like i have a scripture i want to read to close john chapter 6 verses 16 to 21. and when even was now come his disciples went down to the sea and entered into a ship now this isn't a cruise ship this is doesn't have a 250 johnson on it nice casting deck this is a row boat essentially and went over the sea toward capernaum they've gotten they've gotten into this boat and they're going to cross it to capernaum based upon where they entered and where they were going it was six miles across for them to get to the other side and now it was dark and jesus was not come to them so now they've got into this sea they're in this boat the testament on the sea is unfolding and i could say suddenly the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew unexpected these men being familiar with the sea we could assume that they would not have gotten in the boat had they foreseen bad weather coming but things are favorable to sailing the the the weather is good the signs are favorable let's get into the boat and let's row to the other side and go to capernaum and so when they had rode about five and twenty or thirty furlongs about three to four miles so they had just about two more miles to go to the shore six miles from the point of departure point of destination three to four miles in a great wind blows and the storm arises they've got two more miles to go things don't look good all that rowing to get to the other side and now we're just two miles left two thirds of the way there we're almost there we can make it we got the last third to go a great storm blows up and right in the middle of the storm they're fearful that they're going to lose their lives jesus comes walking on the water walking on the sea and drawing night into the ship now what ought had that represented deliverance what did it initially cause fear their help was coming in a way that they didn't expect it if you're drowning in a boat at sea what you don't want to see is some guy in a robe you know dog paddling towards you or an apparition or a ghost you'd love to see a coast guard you want to see a helicopter right they've come to save me they come to rescue but now this the appearance of this one struck fear them but it was jesus walking on the water so he said them it is i be not afraid can we not all admit today no matter where we are in the tempest no matter where we are in our boats no matter where we are in the range you see no matter where we are in our journey from the point of departure to the shore that we're trying to reach can we not just all admit that jesus is the one that can deliver us from all our fears and he's the one that time after time after time appears when we need him with the resolution to our problem and that he's perfectly present and he has a promise for what we need and though initially we might be a little bit scared and we might not be fearful but as soon as he speaks to us we know it is i the lord be not afraid then that's the moment that we can believe that though the storm rages i'm just safe though i've gone these four miles and i've got two more to go i know i'll make it to the other side because jesus is with me it is i be not afraid we often look at this story and we think in terms of the miracle being that christ walked on the water we think in terms of the miracle being when the story is given of jesus walking on the waves and peter walking and those are tremendous miracles but there's a hidden miracle in this story and it's the miracle of his presence and in order for jesus to come walking on the water it's likely that he may have began at the same shore that they began and he knew right at the moment that he started by the time that he got within eyesight would be right about that moment that that great wind would come up saw the wind coming and so he took his steps and god knew because he's omnipotent that about the time the wind hits i'll arrive and they'll look and see me god just planning things god just planning things i had a brother the very moment the very time that god had god was conceiving in vindicating that he was calling there to be a church another phoenix raised up here another church be born i had a brother meet with me and begin to tell me a testimony about how that 20 years prior a situation had happened where bank had messed up in a wire transfer and money had ended up in his account or had not left his account and actually they actually worked with the bank and hired a lawyer and did all sorts of different things in order to try to figure out how to get rid of this money they didn't need it and the resolution of all the actions and the work of the lawyers was you know what it's there we don't want it we make no claims we release it and we give you the money it's yours to keep and over 20 years 20 years ago they said you know what this is from the lord we're gonna put it into a bank in one day a bank account one day god's gonna want us to use it and the brother comes to me says brother aaron we would want to give this to help the church find a building and i thought my to think that one day there's going to be a young girl 21 years old that's going to come to the lord and we'll be able to say the very money that god used to provide for this building that the altar where your soul was sealed god gave it before you were even born before you were even born god allowed a wire mix-up and a working out of a resolution and preserve the funds that's the god we serve not a god that we're not we're worried about this and we're worried about that and god says i'm a god that's here with you right now you say you've been seeking the holy ghost for years if you could just believe it's right here with you right here with you i have to fight for it and claw for it and beg for it and trip my tongue up for it i can believe for it because the miracle of him being here right now was not that and he walked upon the water but when they willingly received him this is an absolute miracle jesus is walking on the water they heard his voice it is i be not afraid but what did they have to do willingly receive him without reluctance without fear knowing it is him i'm not afraid i'm not afraid of this i'm going to embrace this i'm not afraid of what christ is going to do to me i'm not afraid of what this message is going to mean i'm not afraid of what this open word is going to do i'm not afraid of this bible i'm not afraid of truth i'm not afraid of god i willingly receive him regardless of the consequence i take him to me now as my savior i take him as my friend i take him as my comforter i right now receive him willingly as my healer what am i doing i'm willingly receiving him into the ship and here's the miracle and immediately the ship was at the shore where they were going wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what about the two miles didn't matter anymore christ had been willingly received into the boat and their faith was such that hey now that he's here let the storms rage let them toss we're safe and they are willing to endure two miles of a blustery wind rowing against it but what happened when they willingly received him immediately suddenly a boat that was two miles from the shore when the storm arose is now right there at the shore suddenly when it began death was imminent in the middle of it christ was present when he's immediately received there was no evidence of it anymore they're where they were going immediately you could read it this way when they willingly received him suddenly they were where they needed to be suddenly time and distance don't limit god even right now you can willingly receive him suddenly that's the god i believe in suddenly brother john when's it going to happen suddenly suddenly all in a moment everything's going to change do you believe in god that way can you willingly receive him today what are you playing for the micah [Music] heal me oh lord and i will be here save me and i will be saved [Laughter] [Music] heal me o lord i will be here for you are the one i pray you are the one i praise it could happen suddenly saints right now he's here oh heal me oh lord and i will be here save me and i will be safe [Music] oh heal me o lord and i will be here you are the one i pray you are the one [Music] i praise sing it as a prayer today heal me o lord right now heal me o lord and i will be healed save me and i will be saved go and heal me o lord and i will be here [Music] the one i pray oh you are the one i praise with every head bowed i want to invite you today to step out of the box you put yourself in and whatever promise you built around barriers in front of you from i want to invite you to step out of the box say lord i believe you i receive you now my healing my salvation the confirmation of a feeling whatever it might be i'm not going to put you in a box i come out of the box lord and just receive him take him at his word right now and there's there's no premeditation there's no rationale to it it's lord i'm willingly receiving you i receive you and then suddenly things will change i mean this very sensitively very cautiously the question that you had about whether or not you had the holy ghost you can just accept the promise right now and leave it alone from this day forward if you have not received it you can walk in the steps of the word of god to receive it as the word was preached you could say lord i accept the promise i receive it and suddenly why not now if you'd like to receive a promise you can express it in however way you feel that you ought by the lifting of hands or standing upon your feet by a prayer in your heart i say receive him now he's here what you've been seeking is with you willingly receive christ your healer heal me o lord and when you heal me i will be healed save me and when you save i am saved and i worship and i praise and i adore no other therefore lord i can stand with assurance knowing that time frames and parameters and arbitrary expectations have been defeated today with hearts standing and open before the lord i invite sinners to be saved in the presence of god the sick to be healed in the presence of god the bound to be delivered in the presence of god could we lift our voices in prayer to him for those who have lifted hearts and lifted hands and stand upon their feet could we all join together in prayer now our gracious heavenly father lord we believe your word and we now as the body of christ have joined our faith together lord the regardless of how long we have been bound in sin how long we've been bound by circumstance no matter how long we've been bound by sickness if a thousand years is but a day to you then in human lifetime as we have been in your divine presence we can say that you have already done things that would take 80 years to transpire because in your presence the eternal is here with us the omnipotent power of god is available to us and i pray right now with any reservation there's no qualification there's no reservation in my heart there's no other scriptures or quotes where there's word versus word we willingly receive you into our hearts today we really receive christ the healer into our myth we willingly receive the gift giver and we are now welcoming you into our presence as a church into our church services into the very fabric and the dna of our birth lord we are acknowledging you that there would always be the expectation that when your word is lifted up suddenly everything can change and that there'd be no carnal resistance to a move of god and i pray now lord that you would grant the desire of those that have willingly received you and whether it be two miles or 20 years or two decades or two diagnosis or two sicknesses or two backslidings or two marriages two addictions may it be immediately immediately may we find that solid ground we so long for place our feet upon the shore and say it's done it's done thank god almighty it's done bless us today we pray in jesus name amen
