[0:00] revelations chapter 3 verse 13 i'd like
[0:03] to read verse 11
[0:04] to verse 18. and i beheld another beast
[0:07] coming up out of the earth
[0:09] and he had two horns like a lamb and he
[0:12] spake
[0:13] as a dragon and he exercises all the
[0:16] power of the first beast before him and
[0:18] causeth the earth and them which dwell
[0:20] therein to worship the first beast
[0:22] whose deadly wound was healed and he
[0:24] doeth great wonders so that
[0:26] he maketh fire come down from heaven on
[0:28] the earth in the sight of men
[0:30] and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[0:32] earth by the means of those miracles
[0:34] which he had power to do in the sight of
[0:36] the beast saying to them that dwell on
[0:38] the earth
[0:39] that they should make an image to the
[0:41] beast which had the wound by a sword
[0:43] and did live and he had power to give
[0:46] life unto the image of the beast
[0:48] that the image of the beast should both
[0:50] speak and cause that as many as would
[0:52] not worship the image of the beast
[0:54] should be killed and he causeth all both
[0:57] small and great rich and poor
[0:59] free and bond to receive a mark in their
[1:01] right hand
[1:02] or in their foreheads and that no man
[1:04] might buy or sell
[1:06] save he that had the mark or the name of
[1:08] the beast or the number of his name
[1:11] here is wisdom let him that hath
[1:13] understanding count the number of the
[1:14] beast
[1:15] for it is the number of a man and his
[1:17] number is 603 score
[1:19] and six let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:22] heavenly father
[1:24] thank you lord for bringing us to this
[1:26] place this evening to be in fellowship
[1:28] lord we know that there's several that
[1:29] cannot be here we think of sister sandy
[1:32] contradius
[1:33] her and brother victor lord at home and
[1:35] her unable to be in service with
[1:37] us lord we know it's her desire to be in
[1:39] service
[1:40] and lord we pray that you would touch
[1:42] her father continue to mend her wounds
[1:45] and comfort her as she is unable to be
[1:47] here lord there's others that we could
[1:49] think of that circumstance keeps them
[1:51] from gathering together with us and we
[1:53] pray that you'd bless them that you'd be
[1:55] with them that you'd encourage them
[1:57] lord we've felt from the very beginning
[2:00] lord that it's our desire to serve
[2:02] and that the the church is here to serve
[2:05] and lord we don't sit by
[2:06] with an attendance role and take
[2:08] attendance lord and see who's here and
[2:10] who's not here
[2:11] but when one isn't here lord we notice
[2:14] the lord we desire that you'd help them
[2:15] strengthen them and encourage them in
[2:16] whatever situation they may be in
[2:19] and father tonight as we have gathered
[2:21] we recognize that it's your grace that's
[2:22] caused us to be here
[2:24] and now gathered in your presence with
[2:25] one another with your grace
[2:27] made manifest before us we pray that
[2:29] you'd come take these words which we
[2:31] have read thus far
[2:32] make them alive to us by revelation take
[2:35] lord whatever it would be that you've
[2:36] burdened me with father that i
[2:38] i put on paper through quotations of the
[2:41] prophet and
[2:42] scriptures from our bible and you take a
[2:44] hold of it lord
[2:45] you deliver it to the people's hearts
[2:48] you
[2:48] rightly divide the word of truth and you
[2:51] quicken it to them lord that goes beyond
[2:53] just
[2:53] recitation lord and goes beyond just
[2:56] repeating things but it's something that
[2:57] you do
[2:58] and i pray that you do that tonight we
[3:00] pray in the name of the lord jesus
[3:02] christ
[3:02] amen you may be seated
[3:10] i'm kind of continuing on the subject of
[3:12] you were made for this
[3:14] and i found that there certainly is so
[3:17] much
[3:18] here that god has quickened and i'm
[3:20] hoping to
[3:21] hoping to finish uh tonight and it's
[3:24] just me
[3:24] just me saying i hope hope to finish the
[3:27] subject tonight but
[3:28] it was born from just sensing the stress
[3:31] with the pressure
[3:32] that was coming with the uncertainties
[3:34] related to uh the election
[3:37] um even the pandemic and economic things
[3:39] social things
[3:41] and just a lot of different statements
[3:43] of brother branham that we try to bring
[3:44] into view bring into focus could it be
[3:46] this could it be that
[3:47] and so we were we were pondering the
[3:51] current
[3:51] current events and things that were
[3:52] going to be happening and
[3:54] we wanted just to get outside the realm
[3:57] of presumption
[3:58] and speculation and just look to the
[4:00] word of god and anchor in what he said
[4:02] would be
[4:03] and one thing we can say is regardless
[4:05] of what's coming
[4:06] you're made for it that he's made a
[4:09] promise he's going to look out after you
[4:10] he's going to keep you he's going to
[4:11] take care of you
[4:12] so there's nothing coming upon the earth
[4:14] that he does didn't know already was
[4:16] coming
[4:16] and there's nothing prophesied to come
[4:18] upon the earth
[4:19] that we and we may have a clear
[4:21] understanding of things that are to come
[4:23] but we ought not to fear it and let me
[4:25] ask it this way if you're a member of
[4:27] the bride
[4:28] should you be afraid of tribulation even
[4:30] though it's a reality
[4:32] even though it is going to come upon the
[4:33] earth the great tribulation is going to
[4:35] come up on the earth
[4:36] we should not be in fear of it because
[4:37] we know that god is going to take us out
[4:39] of this earth before it comes
[4:41] therefore no matter what's prophesied we
[4:43] look to the promise
[4:45] we look to the word of god and we anchor
[4:47] the fact that he loves us he cares for
[4:48] us
[4:48] and anything coming my way is either
[4:50] going to perfect me or he's going to
[4:52] protect me
[4:53] he's not going to let anything happen to
[4:54] you that he's not going to use for his
[4:56] glory and for your benefit
[4:58] therefore we shouldn't stress we
[4:59] shouldn't tense up we shouldn't act out
[5:01] of fear
[5:02] we shouldn't let go of our confession of
[5:04] faith we shouldn't be
[5:05] driven by certain things that are more
[5:08] national force more natural things but
[5:10] just
[5:10] stay steady in the word of god and so
[5:13] the title you were made for this
[5:14] might not seem like it it carries
[5:18] through some of these things that we're
[5:19] teaching on
[5:20] as it relates to the modern events and
[5:22] the end time conditions
[5:23] but it's i want that to be the overall
[5:25] theme as we're looking at this so you
[5:27] can gain
[5:28] confidence in who you are and what god's
[5:30] made you to be in this end time
[5:32] and the statement that we used at the
[5:33] very end last time
[5:35] okay and we say it because we're looking
[5:37] at the thought of
[5:39] if if we could lose the fear of death
[5:42] and realize we have power over death
[5:43] that's the greatest
[5:45] and the least we we have we shouldn't
[5:47] fear anything
[5:48] and so we're focusing on maybe
[5:50] scriptures and
[5:52] prophecies and things that point to
[5:54] people having to give their lives at the
[5:55] end time people are going to have to die
[5:56] people
[5:57] have to shed their blood and recognize
[5:59] that the bride as a whole
[6:00] is not prophesied to have to shed her
[6:02] blood
[6:03] in order to go in the rapture in order
[6:05] to become a rapture worthy that that's
[6:07] not a prophecy to the bride
[6:09] and so we're looking at death and we're
[6:11] coming to the place where we can say
[6:12] death i'm not afraid of you if we had to
[6:15] give our lives the bride would do it
[6:17] she's that sold out she's that secure
[6:20] and brother branham says he writes this
[6:21] in the church age book chapter 4
[6:23] often we think that it would be almost
[6:24] impossible to be a martyr
[6:27] and i would admit that if as i ponder i
[6:30] think man it just
[6:31] it seems like such a difficult
[6:33] proposition in this time would i be
[6:35] willing to give my life knowing
[6:37] that i have a five-year-old at home
[6:39] knowing i have three children
[6:41] other you know 12 10 and 9 and i have a
[6:44] wife and
[6:45] am i willing just to give my life and
[6:47] leave them leave them behind and there's
[6:49] a lot of
[6:49] a lot of thought process that can go
[6:51] into it you think i just don't know if i
[6:53] could be a martyr and brother i'm saying
[6:54] often we think it would almost be
[6:56] impossible
[6:57] to be a martyr he says but dare to
[6:59] recall that the faith we daily use to
[7:01] triumph in christ jesus
[7:03] is the same faith that upholds the
[7:05] polycarps and all martyrs
[7:07] so it is a faith that's anointed
[7:10] we have the faith for it and if that's
[7:12] what you're going to be called to do
[7:13] it's going to be anointed so he says
[7:15] the supreme faith will give supreme
[7:18] grace for the supreme hour
[7:20] and that's the time that we're living in
[7:21] we're living in the time of the supreme
[7:24] and we're living in a time where this
[7:25] kind of faith is precious
[7:27] and it's the faith of god's elect the
[7:29] supreme faith
[7:30] will give supreme grace for the supreme
[7:32] hour
[7:33] and just a few statements still
[7:35] continuing in review
[7:38] as there's other statements brother ram
[7:41] talks about persecution of the church he
[7:44] talks about church doors being closed
[7:46] and becoming a storehouse
[7:47] and and i felt just to maybe leave those
[7:49] statements aside
[7:51] uh even though there's you can watch it
[7:53] unfolds in certain brother
[7:55] references brother browner makes and
[7:57] i'll say this maybe just to
[7:59] to to add this to clarify there's at
[8:02] least three different instances
[8:03] where brother branham's talking about
[8:05] the church church doors being closed and
[8:07] becoming a storehouse
[8:08] and he says i've read it already and he
[8:11] makes reference to the fact that the
[8:13] lutheran minister had written a document
[8:15] that basically laid it out that if you
[8:17] weren't part of the
[8:19] this organization a part of this charter
[8:21] and the world council of churches
[8:23] that they could use your facility pull
[8:25] your charter or they could come and use
[8:27] your church
[8:28] for a storehouse or close the church
[8:30] doors and so this luther minister was
[8:32] saying it's already in writing he was
[8:34] putting it out there and he was
[8:35] suggesting this
[8:36] and brother branham reads that and then
[8:38] brother brown says hey i've already read
[8:40] it
[8:40] this is what they're saying they're
[8:41] going to do it's already in writing that
[8:43] this is what they're going to do to your
[8:44] churches
[8:44] if you don't join up with this so
[8:46] brother branham was basing certain
[8:48] things he said
[8:49] on the things that were being said by
[8:50] this lutheran and people are writing
[8:52] people are saying
[8:53] so he's basing a lot of these things on
[8:55] what he's hearing and what he's seen
[8:57] behind the thought process
[8:59] of these organizations and these
[9:00] denominations and so there's other
[9:03] statements that brother battle makes and
[9:04] christ is a mystery god revealed and
[9:06] even there in 63
[9:07] that refer to this but we've been
[9:09] looking more particularly at the message
[9:11] look away to jesus
[9:12] and we can see that the word is
[9:14] prophesying of a persecution and a
[9:16] pressure
[9:17] and even a tightening and the word does
[9:19] not prophesy
[9:20] of what we call the squeeze or
[9:22] persecution
[9:24] in order to cause anxiety we shouldn't
[9:27] read look away to jesus we shouldn't
[9:28] read these statements about closing the
[9:30] church doors and
[9:31] putting a dead bolt on it and all those
[9:32] different things in order to cause fear
[9:35] if anything it was if it was thus saith
[9:37] the lord they're gonna put a dead bolt
[9:38] on our church doors and we think well
[9:40] there's gonna be another place to meet
[9:42] amen and
[9:43] earlier this year when all the state
[9:45] home orders were hidden
[9:46] and nobody was able to go to church i
[9:48] told elizabeth i said we're either
[9:50] getting out of here within a number of
[9:51] days or we're getting back to church
[9:53] amen because there's a god-ordained way
[9:56] that our faith is enriched
[9:58] and the way that we come into the
[9:59] knowledge of the son of god and we come
[10:00] into the unity of the faith and to the
[10:02] stature
[10:03] of a perfect man and going to church as
[10:05] part of that amen
[10:07] and we don't live to go to church we go
[10:08] to church to live but we realize you
[10:10] can't stay at home and be a christian
[10:13] you can't stay at home and live the same
[10:15] kind of life and so there's a
[10:16] important part of this dynamics right
[10:19] now where we gather together
[10:20] that god uses to bring us to and is
[10:23] using to bring us to a place of rapture
[10:25] and faith so if this
[10:26] ceased and we could not gather then you
[10:29] might as well just expect to leave
[10:31] it's got to come to that place where
[10:32] god's going to take us take us out of
[10:34] here because this is such a crucial part
[10:36] so there's no reason to fear there's
[10:39] nothing to fear
[10:40] and look away to jesus these things he
[10:42] talks about where foundation point
[10:44] or a beginning point of what he was
[10:46] trying to say look away to jesus it
[10:48] wasn't the conclusion
[10:50] what you should walk away with uh when
[10:52] listening to look away to jesus or
[10:54] reading it is not all there's going to
[10:55] be a squeeze but rather
[10:56] i better stay in this word i want to
[10:59] stay looking at jesus christ i want to
[11:00] be focused on the right things
[11:02] and so our attention should be on christ
[11:06] and and not solely on the crisis
[11:09] if your attention is on the crisis
[11:10] you've got some of the letters right
[11:13] right you're close but you need to be
[11:16] focused on christ not the crisis
[11:18] and if we can just keep our eyes on
[11:20] christ then then we can have confidence
[11:23] in any crisis
[11:24] we can actually just look for him in any
[11:27] difficulty if there's a crisis
[11:29] look for christ within the crisis i'm
[11:31] going to i'm going to look for christ in
[11:32] there
[11:33] if there's a fire look for him in the
[11:34] fire if there is
[11:36] if there's some kind of if there's
[11:38] trouble trouble you're in the raging sea
[11:40] and there's troubled waters
[11:41] look for him to come walking on the
[11:43] water there's there's no fearful thing
[11:45] coming there's no fearful situation
[11:47] there's no difficulty calamity
[11:49] where you shouldn't start looking around
[11:50] saying i need to look for jesus
[11:53] i need to look away from all my carnal
[11:54] feelings all my apprehension
[11:56] all my dread no matter what kind of
[11:57] calamity what kind of
[11:59] a disaster it may seem to be coming upon
[12:01] me i need to be looking
[12:02] for jesus and what a lesson it's so to
[12:05] me and i feel like just so much
[12:07] inspiration is bubbling in my heart
[12:08] right now
[12:09] he says he says this when talking about
[12:11] the third pull
[12:12] and think about how precious this open
[12:14] to the word is to us
[12:16] that no matter what's happening we need
[12:18] to focus on the truth that's revealed in
[12:20] the word
[12:22] and brother branham when this whole
[12:24] concept i say concept of a third pool
[12:26] and it's the angel that used that
[12:28] language god that used that language to
[12:30] brother branham
[12:31] when he's given that vision that has
[12:32] those three parts
[12:34] of lace and a booty and fishing and then
[12:37] that cathedral or that tent which says
[12:39] this will be the third pull this is the
[12:41] language of god that he uses
[12:43] and so there was the first pull second
[12:45] pull and third pull
[12:46] when this vision came to brother branham
[12:48] it came to him
[12:49] on a night that he had just come off the
[12:52] field preaching
[12:54] had considered himself a failure said he
[12:56] wasn't going to be holding any more
[12:58] meetings
[12:58] and was going to go try to get his old
[13:00] job back by talking to his old boss the
[13:02] next day
[13:04] he's going to go get a job again going
[13:06] to go work a regular nine to five
[13:07] wasn't going to be an evangelist anymore
[13:09] wasn't going to be having meetings in
[13:11] prayer lines
[13:11] and his son disagreed with him his wife
[13:13] disagreed with him he's like you know
[13:14] what i'm a failure
[13:16] it was no success after all these years
[13:18] of signs and wonders and the dead being
[13:20] raised and
[13:21] going around the world brother branham
[13:23] was quit he's going to quit doing it
[13:25] and that night after billy paul said dad
[13:28] i think brother billy paul was making a
[13:30] i think you're making a horrible mistake
[13:31] his wife disagreed with nope i'm going
[13:32] to go ask for my old job back i'm coming
[13:34] off the field
[13:35] and that night god gave him the vision
[13:38] of the third pool
[13:40] the vindication of his ministry what we
[13:42] appreciate and loved the most
[13:44] so in the moment where he felt like he
[13:46] was a bitter failure
[13:47] god wanted to say the third pool's
[13:49] coming and that's and i think it should
[13:51] speak to us in the same way when we feel
[13:53] like we're
[13:54] we we've lost our way and it's come to
[13:56] an end and and there's
[13:57] uh and i don't see any way out of this
[14:00] and i've been a failure
[14:01] just keep looking just keep looking
[14:04] and so we've been looking at um we've
[14:07] been quoting donald rumsfeld
[14:09] the great uh general donald rumsfeld
[14:12] secretary of defense and how he said in
[14:14] the gulf war
[14:15] that there was no knowns there were
[14:17] known unknowns but then there were
[14:19] unknown unknowns
[14:21] and you're thinking how could you know
[14:22] you it's a it's an unknown you don't
[14:25] know
[14:26] and he was making a very good point to
[14:27] the media that day and i've been using
[14:29] it just as a basis to say
[14:31] we should focus on the known knowns
[14:34] and there's certain known unknowns we
[14:36] don't know how it's going to be and
[14:37] there's certain prophecies that could
[14:38] still be in symbolic form
[14:40] we don't know exactly how it's going to
[14:41] play out and so we're looking at the
[14:43] known knowns
[14:44] and what we've seen already in the
[14:45] scripture in the in the bible unknown
[14:48] known as it this
[14:49] is a right now it's a spiritual
[14:51] persecution
[14:52] of the bride and it comes by way of
[14:55] deceit it's very cunning it comes with
[14:57] flatteries
[14:57] it's aligned with matthew 24 24 it can
[15:00] be so close
[15:01] that it could deceive the very elect it
[15:03] comes by way of a twin or an
[15:05] impersonation
[15:06] so the real challenge in the world real
[15:08] test to the bride is a word test
[15:10] it's a challenge to stay with the word
[15:12] of god stay with the truth of this hour
[15:14] walk in the light that's the real
[15:16] challenge that we're facing not to give
[15:18] our lives and shed blood
[15:19] but stay in the word of god and we know
[15:22] that it is a
[15:22] spiritual persecution upon the bride and
[15:25] when i say that it's things that relate
[15:27] to the word of god it comes in a
[15:29] spiritual sense
[15:30] in a religious sense in not an economic
[15:33] sense
[15:34] and then also a known known we saw last
[15:36] time is how before this pale horse
[15:39] begins to ride
[15:40] in that fullness of its power to bring a
[15:42] physical persecution on all those
[15:44] who do not bow to that system and take
[15:46] part of that system
[15:47] the bride comes under the anointing of a
[15:50] flying eagle
[15:52] so before this pale horse can come into
[15:54] the fullness of its power
[15:55] the bride's under this anointing of a
[15:57] flying eagle to go meet the lord in the
[15:59] air
[16:00] and so we're not we're not thinking oh
[16:02] how in the world am i going to defend
[16:03] myself against the pale horse
[16:05] the the anointing to combat the pill
[16:07] horse that's coming
[16:08] in its fullness upon laodicea is a
[16:11] rapturing
[16:11] anointing and so we were looking at this
[16:15] uh
[16:16] this persecution how it comes and the
[16:17] persecution of the bride is because
[16:19] of her spiritual revelation of the word
[16:22] that's why the devil is howling it's a
[16:24] revelation of the word of god that's
[16:25] given solely to you
[16:27] and and that's not expressed to try to
[16:30] put a period on who's in and who's out
[16:32] and it's not expressing the way to try
[16:34] to make ourselves feel that we're
[16:35] special
[16:36] but it's the truth that it's to you it
[16:38] is given to know the mysteries of the
[16:40] kingdom
[16:41] to others it is not given amen
[16:44] and so when brother bannon says watch
[16:45] the third pull it's to look at the third
[16:47] pool keep your eyes focused on the right
[16:49] thing
[16:50] because the persecution or the squeeze
[16:52] works in a way to attempt to
[16:54] separate you from the power of the word
[16:56] of god it's an attempt to keep you from
[16:59] the open of the word keep you from the
[17:01] revelation of jesus christ
[17:02] brother brandon said don't let somebody
[17:04] squeeze something into you that's not
[17:06] thus saith the lord
[17:10] so the squeeze is trying to squeeze
[17:12] something into you
[17:14] as we looked in the scripture in
[17:15] revelations chapter 9 those 200 million
[17:17] demons are loosed upon the bride
[17:19] are now working according to feasts of
[17:21] the trumpets are now working in an
[17:22] ecclesiastical realm
[17:24] working in a religious way it's not
[17:26] working boldly through politics
[17:29] it's not working through a government
[17:31] legislation it's not working that way
[17:33] here in america
[17:34] and and we should we should recognize
[17:36] very quickly that when they stay at home
[17:38] orders were instituted
[17:40] this was uh this was upon uh all sorts
[17:43] of businesses this was on all sorts of
[17:45] churches it wasn't that they said well
[17:47] if you believe god sent a prophet and
[17:49] his name's william branham
[17:50] you can't go to church now that would
[17:53] have happened we said whoa now this has
[17:55] manifested itself a lot this is hit and
[17:58] that's different than it's hitting
[17:59] everybody else
[18:00] so there's when it's churches were
[18:02] closing and grocery stores were closing
[18:04] and everything was closing
[18:05] uh we can't try to think it force in our
[18:07] minds oh here it is
[18:09] this is that spiritual persecution this
[18:11] is where it's coming to a razor's edge
[18:13] well no everyone had to stay home
[18:17] catholics pentecostals presbyterians
[18:20] episcopalians
[18:20] they were all staying at home they were
[18:22] all closing their doors so
[18:24] you couldn't take these things happen
[18:25] and put in the category this is where
[18:27] the power is coming to do this
[18:28] but we can say we look how easy it can
[18:31] happen
[18:32] you can see how certain things are being
[18:34] put in place and certain things are
[18:36] happening and certain things are adding
[18:37] up and measuring up
[18:38] there's no doubt things are being added
[18:39] up and measuring up but that's going to
[18:41] work
[18:42] on some but that's not what the bride's
[18:44] worried about
[18:46] she's not worried about those things
[18:48] because before it fully joins with
[18:49] political power
[18:50] this ecclesiastical power before it
[18:52] joins with the political power
[18:54] the bride's going to be gone in a
[18:55] rapture because
[18:57] you'll notice in the scripture i think
[18:58] there's some of these things we'll be
[18:59] able to express tonight
[19:00] that physical persecution these
[19:02] judgments are these things that come
[19:05] down upon the people
[19:06] it's god's judgment upon the church
[19:09] and the word judges god's bride we're
[19:12] receiving our judgment now we avail
[19:13] ourselves to it it's correcting us it's
[19:15] shaping us
[19:16] it's perfecting us but we'll go in a
[19:18] rapture and then what falls is the
[19:19] judgments of god upon those that are
[19:21] left
[19:22] so in revelations chapter 13 and brother
[19:25] branham
[19:25] uh points out how this beast of the sea
[19:28] it's one that comes out of the
[19:29] multitudes of the people
[19:31] and and he relates this to it's the
[19:33] roman catholicism it's this mystery
[19:35] babylon
[19:36] but then when he speaks of the beast
[19:37] coming out of the earth he relates this
[19:39] to the united states how
[19:40] it was a nation that was born now uh
[19:43] not out of people but in the in the
[19:45] pilgrims coming to america
[19:47] and coming to this land that by the time
[19:49] the pilgrims have got here
[19:51] the the explorers that came before had
[19:53] brought diseases into
[19:55] into this this land that so devastated
[19:58] the indigenous populations to where
[20:00] they were decimated by the time that the
[20:02] pilgrims began to come over here and
[20:04] establish colonies in north america
[20:06] disease had already ravaged it and and
[20:08] there was crusades and different things
[20:10] that would come behind it
[20:11] a and a lot of people giving their lives
[20:14] the disease and
[20:15] my you go back and look at how the
[20:16] catholic church performed these crusades
[20:18] that you'd have
[20:19] conquistadors and different ones that
[20:21] actually go to the indigenous people and
[20:23] say
[20:23] either accept the doctrine of the church
[20:25] or you're all going to die
[20:27] and this was happening in the name of
[20:28] the church no wonder people don't like
[20:30] church
[20:32] no wonder christianity has a bad name in
[20:33] a lot of places
[20:35] but brother brown points some of those
[20:36] things out the historical elements out
[20:37] but revelations 13 11
[20:40] it represents the united states as a
[20:42] lamb with two horns
[20:44] speaking as a dragon and the lamb
[20:47] it points out that this this refers to
[20:49] the united states it begins
[20:50] innocently how does it begin with
[20:52] freedom of religion
[20:54] but then it turns to where it begins to
[20:56] speak as a dragon which represents rome
[20:58] or roman catholicism
[21:00] pagan rome then papal rome and brother
[21:02] branham and i'm just taking these things
[21:04] from the message then brother branham
[21:05] talk
[21:05] shows how those two horns and he says
[21:07] this in a number of places
[21:09] that the two horns is a uniting of civil
[21:11] power
[21:12] and ecclesiastical power so it's a
[21:14] uniting of religious power
[21:16] and political power and he talks about
[21:18] how it joins to church and state how
[21:20] these things are going to line up
[21:22] and then we know ultimately it speaks of
[21:24] a uniting then of all denominations all
[21:26] the daughters under mystery babylon
[21:29] under the one harlot she's the mother of
[21:31] all denominations
[21:32] that there's going to be adjoining
[21:33] together and brother branham refers to
[21:36] this ecumenical movement and the world
[21:38] council of churches
[21:39] and how they're all head up and he
[21:42] identifies the election of john
[21:44] f kennedy as a catholic as fulfilling
[21:47] some of these things in part because he
[21:48] says remember that vision in 1933
[21:51] i saw this this coming together and he
[21:53] says and i live to see it with my own
[21:55] eyes
[21:56] and so it's many of these things have
[21:58] already been fulfilled in brother
[21:59] branham's eyes
[22:00] these this joining together these
[22:02] manifestations uh
[22:03] uh whether it be these prophecies of
[22:05] night from 1933 and this powerful woman
[22:07] raising up
[22:08] but we know there's a time when church
[22:10] instead are going to unite together
[22:12] and then there's going to come to the
[22:13] place as we read in revelations chapter
[22:14] 13
[22:15] where it begins to act upon the people
[22:18] in a way to bring persecution
[22:20] and force worship and if you don't
[22:22] you're going to lose your life
[22:24] now brother branham and feast of the
[22:25] trumpets identifies revelations 13
[22:28] and he says now right now it's loosed he
[22:31] says loosed in the ecclesiastical church
[22:33] spirit
[22:34] loosed upon what not up upon the
[22:36] denominations upon the bride
[22:39] in an ecclesiastical way not in a
[22:40] political way
[22:42] not in a civil way not in the state way
[22:44] but in the ecclesiastical realm in the
[22:46] church realm it's released upon the
[22:48] bride
[22:49] he says but here you'll get it the bride
[22:50] will not go through
[22:52] that time the bible says not the church
[22:55] will but not the bride
[22:57] and as we saw this last sunday that time
[22:59] he's referring to the slaughter
[23:01] he's referring to the time where there's
[23:03] a uniting of the civil power
[23:05] the state and the ecclesiastical power
[23:07] the religious power
[23:08] a uniting of church and political
[23:10] religious and political
[23:11] to where it will materially and
[23:13] physically persecute those
[23:15] who do not align itself with its
[23:17] doctrine and line itself with its system
[23:20] and brother branham's saying that the
[23:22] bride will not go through
[23:24] that time so let's not let's not
[23:27] look for that time and this would be my
[23:30] emphasis
[23:31] because please if i seem to be very
[23:33] definitive
[23:34] i am not saying thus saith the lord
[23:36] there won't be suffering
[23:37] i'm not saying thus saith the lord will
[23:39] not be persecution i'm not saying
[23:40] brother bannon said there wouldn't be
[23:41] persecution
[23:42] i'm not saying brother bam said church
[23:43] doors wouldn't be closed
[23:45] or that what he said isn't true i'm
[23:47] saying that when it comes to this
[23:50] brother brandon when it comes to that
[23:52] place where this full power is exercised
[23:54] upon the people we're gone
[23:57] but even right now there's church doors
[23:58] that are closed message church doors
[23:59] that are closed
[24:00] around the world preachers that are
[24:03] thrown into jail
[24:04] ministers that are in prison for
[24:06] standing for this truth so those things
[24:07] are being accomplished
[24:08] but when it comes to right here in
[24:10] america revelations 13 these things come
[24:12] into pass
[24:12] brother brown's identifying that there's
[24:14] a spirit on the bride that raptures her
[24:17] and the rest of the bride worldwide will
[24:19] go with her this can be raptured before
[24:21] these things come into the fullness of
[24:22] their power
[24:23] now in the chapter 10 of the church age
[24:25] book and the resume of the ages brother
[24:27] branham is looking at this very place
[24:29] in scripture revelations chapter 13 he
[24:31] reads actually
[24:32] verses 11 to 18 right after he says this
[24:36] the false group church groups will come
[24:38] together
[24:39] in a world council of churches this
[24:41] world council of churches is the image
[24:43] erected to the beast and then he reads
[24:46] revelations chapter 13
[24:47] verses 11 to 8. so it's false church
[24:50] groups
[24:51] that come together under the image of
[24:53] this beast
[24:54] the false church groups do so then he
[24:57] says this and i'm skipped several places
[24:58] in this reading but he says
[25:00] thus all the people have to belong to
[25:03] this world church system
[25:05] or be at the mercy of the elements for
[25:07] they cannot buy or sell without the mark
[25:09] of the beast
[25:10] in the hand or head
[25:13] now before
[25:18] we take that and start speculating
[25:21] that a mask could be that
[25:24] that mark because you can't go into
[25:27] trader joe's without a mask
[25:31] and they wouldn't they wouldn't sell me
[25:32] my juice cleanse at nectar the other day
[25:35] because i didn't have a mass
[25:36] so you can't buy or sell without a mask
[25:38] hold on now
[25:39] just relax a little bit right
[25:43] i think sometimes people listen to too
[25:46] much talk radio
[25:48] stream too many podcasts and you're
[25:51] when you you realize when you believe
[25:52] some of that stuff you're actually
[25:54] believing
[25:54] what the denominations believe because
[25:56] that's what they're preaching
[25:58] that's what john hagee's preaching
[26:00] that's what some of these other guys out
[26:01] there is preaching and we start buying
[26:03] into it like man did you know did you
[26:04] know did you know
[26:05] that we're all going to have to wear a
[26:06] mask that has a barcode on it and you're
[26:08] when you shop you have to go
[26:09] [Music]
[26:11] right and so just slow down a little bit
[26:16] he says this mark in the head means that
[26:19] they will have to take the doctrine of
[26:21] the world church system which is
[26:22] trinitarianism
[26:24] and the mark of the hand which means to
[26:25] do the will of the world church
[26:27] amen so i can take a known known here
[26:31] i don't know what's going to happen
[26:32] after we're gone people have chips in
[26:34] their hands if
[26:36] if people have barcodes on their heads
[26:38] i'm let them sort that out
[26:40] but i know for me right now is to
[26:42] believe the doctrine and to support it
[26:44] amen
[26:46] that those are the marks right that's a
[26:48] known known if there's multiple levels
[26:50] how it's compound prophecy and different
[26:52] things can be fulfilled
[26:53] i'm not putting the period on it i'm
[26:54] gonna let god interpret it by bringing
[26:55] it to pass
[26:56] but he's showing that it's gonna be a
[26:57] religious world system that comes
[26:59] together
[27:00] it's gonna come to a time he says where
[27:02] if you aren't a part of the system
[27:04] then you're gonna have to rely upon the
[27:05] elements now that seems like oh i'm
[27:07] going to be left out now
[27:08] to where i won't be able to engage in a
[27:11] particular economy
[27:12] and listen he says it this plainly he
[27:14] says with this
[27:15] great power what great power the power
[27:18] of trinitarianism
[27:19] this religious power to of this world
[27:22] council churches
[27:24] the church systems will persecute the
[27:26] true bride
[27:27] church systems will do it theologies
[27:30] ideologies
[27:31] organizations groups and ways of
[27:33] thinking interpretations
[27:35] will persecute the true bride this is
[27:37] this image will try
[27:39] to keep the bride from preaching from
[27:41] preaching and teaching etc
[27:44] they'll try hallelujah through through
[27:47] uh
[27:48] through some intimidation through
[27:50] persecution
[27:52] through ostracization cutting you out of
[27:53] the circle cutting you out of fellowship
[27:55] all these different ways they can do it
[27:56] this is just in the ecclesiastical realm
[27:58] he says her ministers will be forbidden
[28:00] to give comfort
[28:02] and truth to the people who need it
[28:05] now you could read that and say see
[28:08] right there
[28:09] ministers will be forbidden of giving
[28:11] comfort to the bride but that's not what
[28:12] he said
[28:14] he said they'll be forbidden from giving
[28:15] comfort and truth to the people who need
[28:17] it you know who needs it everybody needs
[28:18] it
[28:19] but because of politics because of
[28:22] personality
[28:23] because of persecution because of
[28:25] theology and because of the spirit
[28:27] behind the world council of churches and
[28:29] a denominational spirit
[28:30] the true ministers will not be able to
[28:32] preach truth and give comfort
[28:34] to the people in their congregations why
[28:37] they're pushed out of the pulpit
[28:39] this happens in brother brown's ministry
[28:41] he's no longer
[28:42] able to give the truth and comfort to
[28:43] the people that need it because they
[28:45] pushed him out
[28:47] and it wasn't it wasn't the governments
[28:48] that were doing it was the churches that
[28:50] were doing it
[28:51] and he says you've crucified afresh the
[28:53] son of god
[28:54] he indicted them for the second
[28:56] crucifixion and that wasn't a mandate
[28:58] coming down from jfk
[29:00] that wasn't lyndon b johnson that did it
[29:02] it wasn't governors it wasn't it's
[29:04] senators it wasn't congressman
[29:06] it wasn't anything in a political realm
[29:08] it was religious people that had
[29:10] crucified him again
[29:12] so he says his minister her ministers so
[29:14] they'll try to keep the bride from
[29:16] preaching but she's going to keep on
[29:17] preaching
[29:18] right but the man says she won't be shut
[29:19] up
[29:21] right christ is mr god she won't be shut
[29:23] up should be taken up
[29:24] so before they can shut you up you're
[29:26] going to be taken up
[29:28] and he says they'll be forbidden he says
[29:31] but
[29:32] before the antichrist in person takes
[29:35] over this complete world system of
[29:37] churches
[29:38] the true church will be taken away from
[29:41] this world to be with the lord
[29:43] god will catch away his bride for the
[29:45] great marriage supper of the lamb
[29:48] so what are you looking for the going
[29:50] away
[29:51] that's what we're looking for i'm not
[29:53] looking for the antichrist to come into
[29:54] his fullness because if i see that based
[29:56] upon the teaching of the message
[29:57] i missed it so if you're waiting for the
[30:00] fullness of that to get rapture in faith
[30:02] that
[30:02] that ship already sailed it's too late
[30:05] it's already gone
[30:06] so we're not looking we don't want to
[30:08] keep looking to modern events and
[30:10] who is there a american cardinal that
[30:12] could become
[30:13] the next pope and who's going to be the
[30:14] next president and we're all worried
[30:16] about all those things let's stay
[30:18] focused on
[30:18] jesus christ focused on the word of god
[30:22] because if we're if if there's certain
[30:24] things coming and certain things that
[30:25] may go into motion and
[30:26] certain laws being passed and it sure
[30:28] looks like it's headed a different
[30:29] direction
[30:29] that's when jesus says look up just keep
[30:32] looking up
[30:33] because that means the translation is
[30:35] coming change of our bodies is coming
[30:37] we're not looking out saying oh no
[30:39] they're gonna shut us up and i won't
[30:40] have food for my children this is gonna
[30:41] happen that's gonna happen no we're
[30:42] getting out of here
[30:44] and let me say this the third pull
[30:46] speaks to provision
[30:47] for everything for the bride i i've been
[30:51] it's i i
[30:52] encouraged just how the trajectory of
[30:54] these things is coming together when we
[30:55] left off speaking on
[30:57] in the beginning god created i was
[30:59] coming to a place where the third pull
[31:01] comes into view
[31:02] god speaking out into creation and then
[31:05] looking at this so much of these five
[31:06] temporary manifestations of the third
[31:08] pull
[31:09] are mentioned in context of persecution
[31:11] tightening and squeeze
[31:12] and the power of the open of the word
[31:14] these five temporary manifestations
[31:17] of the third pull speak to the promise
[31:20] that the bride has
[31:21] in the fullness of the word regardless
[31:24] of what it is
[31:25] physical healing salvation of your
[31:27] children
[31:28] the the the walking with god
[31:32] and the the the the defeating of cancers
[31:35] the care and love for your wife all
[31:37] these different things are mentioned and
[31:38] even to the point where there's
[31:39] provision
[31:40] in the open of the word if it relates to
[31:42] food
[31:43] because brother branham when he when he
[31:45] spoke squirrels into existence
[31:47] brother bam wasn't just hunting for
[31:48] sport he was hunting for food
[31:51] amen and so there is a there is a
[31:54] a provision that is spoken to there's a
[31:56] promise spoken to
[31:57] in five temporary manifestations to
[31:59] where we realize now with the fullness
[32:01] of the word
[32:02] and us being the fullness of the
[32:04] expression of that word
[32:05] we're not fearing our children we're not
[32:08] fearing for
[32:08] food we're not fearing for anything
[32:13] we're resting in the promise of god's
[32:15] word
[32:16] he said before it comes to this place
[32:18] the bride's going to be taken away
[32:20] in a rapture taken away for this world
[32:22] from this world to be
[32:23] with the lord god will catch away his
[32:25] bride
[32:26] so be before it comes to that place
[32:29] where you're pressed out before it comes
[32:31] to a place
[32:32] where there's it's gonna these things
[32:33] are being manifest you're already gone
[32:36] in luke chapter 21 verses 33 to 36 it
[32:38] says heaven and earth shall pass away
[32:40] but my words shall not pass away
[32:44] now think of that heaven and earth will
[32:46] pass away but his word will not pass
[32:48] away his words shall not pass away
[32:50] take heed to yourselves lest at any time
[32:53] your hearts be overcharged with
[32:55] surfeiting
[32:56] and drunkenness and cares of this life
[33:00] so whether there be some excess there's
[33:02] some carelessness
[33:04] so some some a lack of moderation in
[33:07] cares of this life i'm so
[33:08] bowed down by the pressures of laodicea
[33:10] he says so that that day come upon you
[33:13] unawares
[33:15] for as a snare shall it come on all them
[33:17] that dwell
[33:19] on the face of the whole earth there's
[33:22] that
[33:22] that day's coming but remember we're
[33:25] believing that brother man says
[33:26] the bride will not go through that time
[33:29] so we want to
[33:30] he take heed ourselves and not let our
[33:33] hearts be overwhelmed
[33:36] and he says because this snare is going
[33:37] to come upon everyone that dwells upon
[33:39] the face of earth he says
[33:40] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[33:42] you may be accounted worthy
[33:44] to escape all these things that shall
[33:47] come to pass
[33:48] and to stand before the son of man
[33:52] that that speaks to me that speaks to me
[33:55] in the context of luke 21 the context of
[33:57] matthew 24
[33:58] it speaks to me to believe that what i
[34:01] must do is watch
[34:02] the word watch what he has said pray
[34:05] always
[34:05] that i may be counted worthy to escape
[34:08] the snare that's going to come upon
[34:10] all them that dwell upon the face of the
[34:12] whole earth that i'll be counted worthy
[34:14] to escape
[34:14] all these things that shall come to pass
[34:16] and where will i be standing
[34:17] in the presence of the son of man in the
[34:22] presence of jesus christ
[34:23] in his glorified body with a glorified
[34:25] body to match his glorified body
[34:27] with the rest of the resurrected saints
[34:29] in their glorified bodies
[34:31] that's what if we can stay connected and
[34:34] tethered to the word of god
[34:35] i'm not worried about having to give my
[34:37] life in this realm i'm not worried about
[34:39] the things that are coming upon the
[34:40] earth
[34:40] yes there'll be individual challenges
[34:42] your family will be challenged there's
[34:43] people that'll lose their jobs
[34:45] there's people that'll despair for food
[34:46] there's believers that will despair for
[34:48] life
[34:48] there's sicknesses there's disease
[34:50] there's divorce there's tribulation
[34:51] that we suffer in a personal level and
[34:53] we'll all have to meet that with faith
[34:56] and the supreme faith will give us
[34:57] supreme grace for the supreme hour
[34:59] but when it comes to a prophecy of the
[35:01] elect she is
[35:02] under a prophecy of a translation
[35:05] she is under a promise of provision
[35:08] that's what we rest in and so we're
[35:11] watching the word of god we're watching
[35:13] the third pool we're staying with his
[35:14] words that shall not pass away
[35:16] heaven and earth will pass away but his
[35:18] word shall never pass away
[35:20] so he says watch that you might be
[35:21] counted worthy you're counted worthy
[35:25] you are the ones that are worthy to
[35:26] escape the things that are coming upon
[35:27] the earth
[35:28] because watch because god brings away a
[35:30] vicks gate
[35:32] in the message of noah that was telling
[35:35] that rain was coming upon the earth and
[35:36] everyone would be slaughtered
[35:38] there was a promise of an ark
[35:41] so the very the very warnings of
[35:43] judgment look for the way
[35:45] where is it in this prophecy of this and
[35:48] the prophecy of that and all these
[35:49] statements these
[35:50] terrible things that are coming upon the
[35:51] earth where's the way of escape
[35:53] i made reference to it maybe last week
[35:56] how that brother man i'm talking about
[35:57] these plagues coming upon the earth
[35:59] and only those who have the holy ghost
[36:01] will escape it right
[36:03] i believe i actually have those
[36:04] scriptures here tonight to get to it
[36:06] but they're contained in revelations 19
[36:08] they're contained in different places
[36:11] where brother branham or they they're
[36:12] parallel to these places in scripture we
[36:14] realize
[36:14] brother branham is pointing to a time
[36:17] of tribulation under the sixth seal
[36:21] when the bride is gone the very
[36:23] scriptures he's referencing of these
[36:25] things that are coming upon the earth
[36:27] he said all those who have the holy
[36:28] ghost are not going to be impacted by it
[36:31] think well how can this be how can this
[36:32] be and you realize the mystery of that
[36:34] is the bride's translated when that time
[36:36] comes
[36:38] so look for the way of escape and listen
[36:40] if there's something that look well
[36:41] brother aaron i can't see it
[36:43] it just seems like an airtight case
[36:44] we're all going to have to give our
[36:45] lives brother aaron i can't see it we're
[36:47] all going to have this is going to
[36:48] happen that's going to happen then what
[36:48] i would tell you to do is just take it
[36:50] and lay it there
[36:51] and just leave it there and pray lord
[36:54] show me
[36:56] in this threat of things to come in this
[36:59] prophecy
[37:00] show me my promise show me
[37:03] show me the full take let me take the
[37:05] full word of god in consideration
[37:07] because god brings a way of escape from
[37:10] the snare that shall come upon all them
[37:12] that dwell upon the face of the earth
[37:13] from this great power that's going to
[37:16] come into this
[37:17] man even the manifestation of the
[37:18] antichrist he says in person where these
[37:22] marks come into the image is erected
[37:24] unto the beast this ecclesiastical power
[37:26] joining with political power the revival
[37:28] of church and state united together
[37:30] god provides a way of escape and where
[37:32] is it revelations 18 4.
[37:36] it's in there he says and i heard
[37:37] another voice from heaven saying
[37:39] come out of her my people that you be
[37:41] not partakers of her sins
[37:44] and that you receive not of her plagues
[37:47] there's plagues coming upon her by
[37:49] virtue of her sins her sins of unbelief
[37:51] and her plagues
[37:52] it's the judgment it's physical
[37:53] persecution it's death all those things
[37:56] are
[37:56] her plagues so he says come out of her
[38:00] my people
[38:00] that you be not partakers of her plagues
[38:04] we're not partakers of her sins and that
[38:06] you received not of her plagues
[38:07] so we have heard revelations 18 4. have
[38:10] you heard it
[38:11] do we believe brother iran identified
[38:13] himself as being one who spoke according
[38:15] to this
[38:15] he is the angel of revelations 18 4
[38:19] and therefore we have to be here in
[38:20] revelations 18
[38:22] to have heard this voice that says come
[38:24] out of the system come out of the
[38:26] organization
[38:26] come up from underneath that spirit
[38:29] listen you don't have to have a
[38:31] slash inc on the end of your church name
[38:33] or have a register be registered with
[38:34] the state
[38:35] or or be an official member of a
[38:38] denominational organization
[38:39] to be under denominational spirit
[38:42] i remember years ago brother biscuit was
[38:44] criticized
[38:45] as an organization because he had
[38:47] bibleway.org and man there was a whole
[38:48] group of people saying
[38:49] mark of the beast ah.org you know he had
[38:52] there he was he had it that's why we're
[38:54] dot com
[38:55] but uh but i did register.org um so
[38:58] don't try it or i'll sell it to you
[39:00] how's that
[39:01] anybody want to buy a domain but there's
[39:04] these little little things they start to
[39:06] criticize and it doesn't you don't have
[39:07] to have.org in your url
[39:09] you have to be registered with the state
[39:11] to be under a denominational spirit
[39:14] come under the spirit of a dominating
[39:16] female
[39:18] and to become a church that's
[39:19] characterized by the woman
[39:21] the fallen woman in mystery babylon
[39:23] through spirit through cruelty
[39:26] as opposed to the body of christ which
[39:29] is that
[39:29] the lamb's wife and the new jerusalem so
[39:33] it says come out of her
[39:34] my people this powerful beautiful woman
[39:37] yet cruel
[39:38] right that john was marveled at
[39:41] he says come out of her that you receive
[39:42] not of her plagues and remember
[39:44] the last plague before the rapture is
[39:48] spiritual death the last plague to hit
[39:51] the earth the last plague to hit the
[39:53] church
[39:53] is spiritual death in the exodus the
[39:56] last plague to hit
[39:58] the whole land was death
[40:01] right and that was upon everyone except
[40:04] those
[40:05] who had followed the prophet's message
[40:09] had the token applied had the lamb
[40:11] inside
[40:12] right so we see it a parallel in a type
[40:15] then
[40:16] that this last plague that hits the
[40:18] world and hits the church is spiritual
[40:21] death
[40:22] but only those who have the token who
[40:24] have the lamb
[40:26] inside they're the ones that bypass the
[40:29] spiritual death
[40:30] bill abraham says in the fourth seal
[40:32] like he give egypt he give egypt place
[40:34] to repent
[40:34] what was the last plague was death
[40:37] that's the
[40:38] last plague that hits the pentecostal
[40:40] church which is the laodicean church age
[40:42] it's spiritual death and then he says
[40:44] she's dead
[40:46] that's in the name of the lord she's
[40:48] spiritually dead
[40:49] he gave her place to repent and she
[40:52] rejected it
[40:53] now she's dead she'll never rise again
[40:57] laodicea is not going to rise again
[40:58] there's no revival coming out of leo to
[40:59] see you
[41:01] pentecostal church is not raising again
[41:04] that eve and this is why god hated it so
[41:06] much he had restored
[41:08] even the gifts that were lost that
[41:10] represented the la the one of the last
[41:12] things that was taken away from that
[41:13] church on the day of pentecost
[41:15] it's restored genuine pentecostals
[41:18] and brother ram as a messenger is coming
[41:20] out preaching telling them
[41:22] get back come back come back come back
[41:24] tell them and they reject it and he says
[41:26] she's dead
[41:27] when the seals are being opened she's
[41:28] dead in the name of the lord
[41:30] she's spiritually dead that's the plague
[41:32] that's come upon her
[41:33] she's rejected it she's now dead she'll
[41:35] never rise again
[41:36] so what do you need not a revival of
[41:38] that woman but a message to call you out
[41:40] of it amen
[41:41] she says come out of her my people
[41:42] because the bride hadn't received her
[41:44] revival yet but what was her revival
[41:46] the revealing of the seven seals the
[41:48] manifestation of god
[41:50] to wake her up again that's what brother
[41:52] branham says when he's preaching those
[41:53] seven seals
[41:54] so here we see that the last plague upon
[41:56] the earth is spiritual death
[41:59] the last plague upon the church is
[42:01] spiritual death
[42:03] and we receive a message come out of her
[42:05] so we have life
[42:07] revelations chapter 19 verses 7 to 9 as
[42:10] brother banham said that the bride is
[42:12] going to be
[42:13] taken away to the marriage supper of the
[42:14] lamb where does the union take place
[42:17] takes place here right now so you're not
[42:20] called away to the marriage but the
[42:21] marriage supper
[42:23] revelations chapter 19 verses 7 to 9 let
[42:25] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[42:26] him
[42:27] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[42:30] and his wife
[42:30] hath made herself ready and to her was
[42:34] granted that she should be arrayed and
[42:35] find linen clean and white for the fine
[42:37] linen is the righteousness of the saints
[42:39] and he said unto me right blessed are
[42:42] they which are called unto the marriage
[42:44] supper of the lamb
[42:45] why are they blessed just go back and
[42:48] read what they miss
[42:52] they're missing these vials that come
[42:53] forth under the sixth seal they're
[42:55] missing these things that are
[42:56] mentioned here before the tribulation
[42:58] upon the earth the the hailstones that
[43:00] are coming all these different things
[43:01] that are come upon the earth
[43:02] the bride misses those things it says
[43:04] blessed are they which are called unto
[43:05] the marriage supper of the lamb and he
[43:07] says and he saith unto me these are the
[43:08] true sayings of god
[43:10] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[43:13] now in this i see an example or type
[43:17] of us in our message of revelations 18 4
[43:19] come out of her my people
[43:20] and he said to me see thou doest did not
[43:23] i am thy fellow servant
[43:25] and of thy brethren that have the
[43:26] testimony of jesus
[43:28] worship god for the testimony of jesus
[43:30] is the spirit of prophecy
[43:33] so we never want to make the mistake of
[43:34] worshiping william branham
[43:36] we never want to make the mistake of
[43:37] elevating him above scripture elevating
[43:40] him above the word and so we're not
[43:42] worshiping william branham we're not
[43:43] brahmites we're not looking
[43:44] for brother branham to fulfill all the
[43:46] word of god we're looking to jesus
[43:48] christ
[43:48] to bring the fulfillment of all the word
[43:50] of god and he delivered to us a message
[43:53] saying blessed are they which are called
[43:55] into the marriage supper of the lamb
[43:57] because they're going to leave before
[43:58] that time
[44:00] they're going to be under the anointing
[44:01] of the flying eagle to escape this pale
[44:03] horse rider when he comes
[44:05] riding out against the church they're
[44:06] going to be gone in the rapture before
[44:08] the antichrist takes his full control
[44:10] over church and state there's going to
[44:11] be the bride's going to be gone so
[44:13] blessed are they which are called
[44:15] unto the marriage supper of the lamb but
[44:17] who's left
[44:18] those who didn't heed what this
[44:21] revelations 19 10
[44:22] said he said don't worship me i'm your
[44:25] fellow servant
[44:27] one that has the testimony of jesus
[44:28] christ he says worship god don't worship
[44:30] me
[44:32] and brother branham writes in the church
[44:33] age book chapter 5
[44:35] he said then there is elijah to whom the
[44:37] word of the lord came
[44:38] when he got through preaching the truth
[44:40] and that group back there
[44:42] that this for that this is the
[44:44] forerunner of
[44:45] the american jezebel group would not
[44:47] receive the word
[44:50] god called him off the field and plagued
[44:53] that generation for rejecting the
[44:55] prophet
[44:55] in the message that god had given how
[44:58] are they plagued
[44:59] spiritual death right that's a known
[45:02] known
[45:02] they're plagued with spiritual death but
[45:04] notice it comes upon those that reject
[45:06] the prophet
[45:07] and the message that's given he says
[45:09] this in the seventh seal now we're in
[45:11] the eagle age
[45:13] we're in the age of the eagle the
[45:15] revelation to be revealed the whole
[45:17] thing
[45:17] compare this with revelations 10 verses
[45:19] 1 to 7
[45:20] then in the days of the sound of the
[45:22] seventh angel's message was to finish up
[45:24] all the mysteries of god
[45:25] we find out also that the sixth seal now
[45:28] being
[45:29] opened it was for a threefold purpose so
[45:31] let's contrast this
[45:33] the eagle age the eagle anointing the
[45:36] revelation of the seven seals
[45:38] revelations 10 1 to 7 the mighty angel
[45:40] descended with the book open
[45:41] but now the sixth seal that's opened for
[45:43] a threefold purpose
[45:45] he said here was the purpose the first
[45:47] thing was that the sleeping virgins have
[45:49] to go through the tribulation period for
[45:51] purification
[45:53] she had to be purged of her sins of
[45:55] unbelief
[45:56] and rejecting the message this she was
[45:59] done in the tribulation period
[46:02] so the tribulations that to come is to
[46:05] purge
[46:07] for what rejecting the message
[46:10] brother said they reject the atonement
[46:12] in its fullness so the plagues the
[46:14] judgment the persecution
[46:16] it comes upon those that have actually
[46:17] rejected the true message
[46:20] they've rejected the heartbeat of it the
[46:22] revelation of it they rejected the truth
[46:24] rejected the truth of it
[46:25] so the tribulation under the sixth seal
[46:27] is upon those who are
[46:28] left who do not go under the eagle
[46:31] anointing of revelations 10
[46:32] amen because the seventh seal is to the
[46:35] bride it is christ
[46:36] it results in a marriage that takes you
[46:38] away to the marriage supper you're not
[46:40] left for those things under the sixth
[46:42] seal they're not for you
[46:44] because it's a threefold purpose the
[46:46] persian of the foolish virgin
[46:47] the purging of israel and the purging of
[46:49] the earth
[46:51] so if it's under the sixth seal it
[46:52] doesn't apply to you
[46:54] you could even see how the fourth seal
[46:56] applies to the judgment of laodicea and
[46:58] death the fifth seal relates to martyrs
[47:00] the sixth seal
[47:01] to the purge of the foolish virgin
[47:03] persian of israel the purging of the
[47:04] earth the seventh seal is yours
[47:07] it's christ the mighty angel descended
[47:09] to receive you unto himself
[47:11] to take you out of here to escape all
[47:12] those things that have come
[47:14] you should rejoice that you've been
[47:15] counted worthy to escape the tribulation
[47:17] that's to come
[47:19] and listen i believe we ought to preach
[47:21] it to give you confidence
[47:22] that if you stay in the word of god and
[47:24] have faith then you're more than able to
[47:26] take what's coming
[47:28] and not try to put you under some kind
[47:30] of fear to bind you close to this pulpit
[47:32] better stick with us here better be with
[47:35] us you're not going to be able to make
[47:36] it
[47:37] and try to put fear into you that you
[47:38] need to resort to some kind of humanism
[47:40] to make it through what's coming no
[47:44] i believe god all he has to do is raise
[47:45] up one amen
[47:47] and if you have to just be the one in
[47:49] whatever church you would go to say i'm
[47:50] the one that's been counted worthy
[47:52] it's not a church move it's not a group
[47:54] move it's an individual move
[47:56] that's embodied in this body of christ
[47:59] around the world our brothers and
[48:00] sisters
[48:03] brother adam says this and does that
[48:05] does that resonate with you amen
[48:08] in the message of shame he says you know
[48:09] in the last days they're supposed to be
[48:11] them plagues repeat again
[48:13] all right this is where all the quotes
[48:14] we were looking up back in march right
[48:17] here it is
[48:22] he says and remember an adulterer in the
[48:23] bible time his penalty was death by
[48:25] stoning
[48:26] and the unbelieving church will be
[48:28] stoned to death with hailstones
[48:30] wow was once god's way that he says
[48:33] which was once god's way of punishment
[48:35] he'll stone this unbelieving world this
[48:37] adulterous generation
[48:38] he'll stone it from heaven he's
[48:40] referring to revelation 16
[48:42] and revelations 19 under the sixth seal
[48:44] that's what he's referring to if you go
[48:46] back and look at what he's
[48:47] what he's quoting from these these
[48:48] stones that weigh a talent a piece he
[48:49] says these hailstones weighing a town a
[48:51] piece which is a hundred pounds
[48:52] the adulterous church will die the
[48:55] adulterous world will die
[48:56] under the punishment of god under
[48:58] stoning like he did in the beginning
[49:00] the plagues coming upon all the earth
[49:02] there's a snare to catch everyone
[49:04] and everyone's going to be subject to it
[49:06] and hailstones will be coming down
[49:07] it's god's righteous judgment upon the
[49:09] world and upon the church for rejecting
[49:11] the message
[49:12] he calls them the unbelieving church and
[49:14] we're not going to be here as spectators
[49:18] sure glad i got my malachi 4-5 umbrella
[49:22] nope you're going to be gone you're out
[49:24] of here
[49:27] i'm trying to go quick i bit off more
[49:29] than i could shoot again
[49:30] he says in god hiding himself in
[49:32] simplicity he's already told us this the
[49:34] rapture
[49:36] then judgments will strike he's already
[49:39] told us
[49:40] the rapture then judgments will strike
[49:43] sin plagues sickness and everything
[49:47] the people cry for death to make them
[49:50] take them from the judgment lord why is
[49:52] this judgment come upon us
[49:53] when you said there would be a rapture
[49:55] first he'll say
[49:56] it's already come and you didn't know it
[49:59] god hiding himself in simplicity
[50:02] oh my all right it's already happened
[50:05] and you knew it not
[50:07] let me just say this and i'm not just
[50:09] trying to use
[50:11] simple logic but i believe this is this
[50:13] is this is scriptural
[50:15] scripturally sound if there is going to
[50:18] be a literal disease
[50:19] come upon all the earth and only those
[50:22] who have the holy ghost
[50:24] do not get it you have just created
[50:26] another evidence of the holy ghost
[50:32] and what does that do to a genuine holy
[50:34] spirit-filled believer
[50:36] puts them in the state of awaiting
[50:38] judgment
[50:40] that a blood test or a nasal swab
[50:44] is going to determine whether or not
[50:46] they're the elect
[50:48] so it takes a genuine holy spirit-filled
[50:50] believer
[50:51] and places them under a state of now
[50:54] judgment where i'm subject
[50:56] to a medical test to determine whether
[50:58] or not i've got the holy ghost
[50:59] and you've created another evidence and
[51:01] you've put the believer out on no
[51:03] there's no solid ground
[51:06] the evidence of the holy ghost is to
[51:07] receive the word amen
[51:10] and any subsequent evidence is no better
[51:13] than speaking in tongues
[51:17] we've got to be careful what kind of
[51:18] theology we build around statements
[51:20] brother man says here these plagues
[51:21] these sins these sicknesses that are
[51:23] coming
[51:25] he says it happens after the rapture
[51:28] oh i thought these things were going to
[51:29] happen oh he's already come
[51:32] he's saying this and god hiding himself
[51:34] simplicity right before he preaches the
[51:35] seals
[51:36] it's already coming you didn't know it
[51:37] god hiding himself in simplicity oh my
[51:39] all right
[51:40] it's already happened and you knew it
[51:42] not why don't believers believe the
[51:44] simple signs of his coming
[51:47] they're expecting all these things that
[51:49] spoke of by the scripture
[51:50] and the sun's going down in the middle
[51:52] of the day and there's going to be all
[51:54] kinds of things
[51:54] i got notes wrote here to show what them
[51:56] things are and we'll get to it on the
[51:58] breaking of these seals
[51:59] this week anyhow there it is just where
[52:02] it's already passed and you didn't know
[52:04] it
[52:06] so if the angel lord will break them
[52:07] seals forth to us
[52:09] they're looking for the judgments to
[52:10] come or they're looking for something to
[52:12] happen before these judgments come
[52:14] and right as he preaches before he
[52:15] preaches they opened the seals he says
[52:17] the the rapture's already come
[52:21] and you missed it when these sins
[52:24] plagues and sicknesses and everything
[52:25] come upon the earth
[52:26] notice how he places it in the god of
[52:28] this evil age he says this naked
[52:30] stripped stripped-off bunch of
[52:31] laodiceans worshiping the god of this
[52:33] world through their ethics and education
[52:35] and shrewdness
[52:36] and prettiness notice notice how he
[52:39] describes them he says come out of her
[52:42] there's your revelations 18 4 be not
[52:45] partakers of her sins and don't receive
[52:47] her plagues
[52:49] follow the prophet as he lays this down
[52:51] very perfectly here god will reign hell
[52:54] out of the skies one day
[52:55] as big as a hundred pounds of peace and
[52:57] will destroy her by stoning her
[53:00] like his word always said he done his
[53:02] laws
[53:03] who is it coming upon the church
[53:06] what is the church the subject to the
[53:08] pale horse rider subject to the
[53:10] antichrist
[53:11] so he says well if god did a thing like
[53:13] that revealed his word to such a people
[53:15] as that
[53:15] he would be defeating his own purpose
[53:18] god is not foolish he's the source of
[53:19] all wisdom
[53:20] so you see where that stuff come from it
[53:22] comes from satan and it's still satan
[53:24] and the church has believed it now if
[53:27] you
[53:28] yeah and i don't think it's super deep
[53:30] here but pause for a moment and notice
[53:32] what he says
[53:33] the judgment is coming upon those to
[53:35] whom god has not revealed himself to
[53:39] he says would god reveal himself to
[53:41] somebody and then judge him like that
[53:43] in other words god's not going to reveal
[53:44] himself to you through the open of the
[53:46] word the third pull
[53:47] and show himself to you the full word be
[53:50] born in a manifestation
[53:51] quicken to the bride you've heard from
[53:53] your theophany you're raptured up
[53:55] quickly to meet it you're feeding an
[53:56] unfailing body word of the son of man
[53:58] and then hailstones are gonna rain down
[54:00] upon you not gonna happen
[54:03] listen not one drop is your motto
[54:07] not one drop is how you ought to see
[54:10] this there's not
[54:11] one drop of tribulation going to strike
[54:12] before the bride's gone
[54:15] you're actually holding away the
[54:16] judgment coming upon the church
[54:18] you're holding away the judgment gonna
[54:19] come upon laodicea you're holding away
[54:21] all these kind of catastrophes and
[54:23] things that are going to come down upon
[54:24] it
[54:25] you're holding it away second
[54:26] thessalonians chapter 2 verses 7 to 15.
[54:30] i'm still i'm still under an hour so i
[54:32] feel
[54:34] i feel like i can just read this and
[54:36] just have a few more
[54:37] a few more jabs and hooks and throws at
[54:40] the devil and
[54:40] wrap it up ii thessalonians chapter 2
[54:43] verses 7 to 15
[54:45] for the mystery of iniquity death work
[54:47] doth already work
[54:49] only he who now let us will let until
[54:52] she brother ram said be taken out of the
[54:56] way
[54:57] she is him so
[55:00] she is he until he which is her
[55:04] be taken out of the way and the
[55:06] beautiful brother branham
[55:08] brings that clarity to us that what's
[55:10] holding it away right now
[55:11] is the elect and then shall that wicked
[55:15] be revealed whom the lord shall consume
[55:17] with the spirit of his mouth
[55:19] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[55:20] his coming brother branham and i don't
[55:22] have the statements here
[55:24] but brother branham in the seals i can't
[55:26] remember if it's the first seal
[55:28] the third seal he identifies this
[55:30] scripture as
[55:31] transpiring the wicked one being
[55:33] revealed or exposed
[55:35] and then he's asking questions and
[55:36] answers brother branham does the opening
[55:38] of these seals
[55:39] the first seal does it do this ii
[55:41] thessalonians 2 3 says yes
[55:43] so in spiritual now it's revealed to us
[55:47] spiritually he says verse 9 even him
[55:51] whose coming
[55:51] is after the working of satan with all
[55:53] powers and signs and lying
[55:55] wonders and with all deceitfulness of
[55:58] unrighteousness
[56:00] in them that perish because they
[56:01] received not the love of the truth that
[56:03] they might be
[56:04] saved now he's talking about powers
[56:07] signs and wonders
[56:08] it's what we read about in revelations
[56:10] 13. where it talks about how
[56:12] it he had these great wonders and it
[56:14] makes fire to come down he deceived them
[56:16] that dwell on the earth by the means of
[56:17] those miracles which he had power to do
[56:19] in the sight of the beast
[56:21] so all these all this deceivableness and
[56:24] satan work with all powers signs and
[56:25] lying wonders
[56:26] only works on them that perish
[56:30] why because they received not the love
[56:32] of the truth
[56:33] that they might be saved from that time
[56:37] save from the deceit saved from the
[56:39] delusion and for this cause god shall
[56:41] send them
[56:42] strong delusion that they should believe
[56:44] a lie he sent you
[56:46] truth but he sends them delusion that
[56:48] they all might be
[56:50] damned who believed not the truth but
[56:53] had pleasure in
[56:53] unrighteousness this is paul prophesying
[56:56] of this church that take that is under
[56:59] this plague of
[57:00] spiritual death and how if it remains
[57:02] those that remain in this system
[57:04] after the bride is gone all that's left
[57:06] is this mark of the beast
[57:08] this power of of spiritual deception to
[57:11] even work in a physical way to deceive
[57:14] people
[57:14] and he says they'll believe a lie
[57:16] because they didn't love the truth
[57:17] they didn't receive a love of the truth
[57:19] you should thank god that you love the
[57:20] truth he gave you that
[57:22] amen and they're all damned because of
[57:25] it
[57:26] and they're they're not saved but rather
[57:27] they perish then notice verse 13
[57:30] but we are bound to give thanks always
[57:32] to god for you brother and beloved of
[57:33] the lord because god
[57:35] hath from the beginning chosen you to
[57:38] salvation
[57:39] to be saved through sanctification of
[57:42] the spirit and belief
[57:43] of the truth
[57:46] you are the the he in second
[57:48] thessalonians 2
[57:50] 7 you're the he there
[57:54] you're the one that has spoken of
[57:59] he's bound to give thanks always to god
[58:02] for you
[58:03] because you've been chosen to escape
[58:07] where until he called you by her gospel
[58:09] to the obtaining of the glory of the
[58:10] lord jesus christ
[58:12] therefore brethren stand fast
[58:15] you know what the truth hold the
[58:17] traditions which you've been taught
[58:19] whether by word or our epistle
[58:22] hold fast to the things that you've been
[58:25] taught
[58:26] in this bible and in this message hold
[58:29] fast to them
[58:31] because that's your way of escape
[58:34] that's your safety your love for the
[58:37] truth is your inoculation against deceit
[58:42] it's your it's your uh what
[58:45] i'm trying to think immunization
[58:46] passport
[58:49] i guess we could say i'm trying to think
[58:50] of the word herd immunity
[58:52] well the bride's got it drop the d it's
[58:55] her
[58:56] immunity amen she's got it she's been
[58:58] inoculated
[59:00] and and the way that we achieve that is
[59:01] we all come under the blood
[59:04] we've come under the we've come under
[59:05] the power of the revealed word
[59:07] and satan is ineffective against that he
[59:10] doesn't even know he doesn't even know
[59:11] what to do with it because he don't know
[59:12] what it is
[59:15] these scriptures these things you read
[59:17] there's so many things to share with you
[59:18] but at the end of the day what i'm
[59:20] trying to emphasize to you what i'm
[59:21] hoping i've showed
[59:22] in bits and pieces and different ways
[59:24] that it's come forth is that the bride
[59:26] is secure amen this word
[59:30] is enough could you imagine if we got so
[59:34] desperate
[59:36] that we were more concerned about who
[59:38] was in office
[59:40] than who was being revealed to protect
[59:42] us from the things that had come
[59:45] that we lost hope in the provision of
[59:47] the word of god because the wrong one
[59:49] gets voted in and we despair
[59:52] i read an article and i've clipped it i
[59:54] thought about sharing it with you last
[59:55] sunday
[59:56] how it's in the new york times and they
[59:58] said how the evangelicals when they
[59:59] begin to flock to the republican party
[1:00:01] that it began as a as a kind of a swell
[1:00:05] of support for certain platforms and
[1:00:07] certain things that were held within the
[1:00:08] republican party
[1:00:09] but then he said through time the salt
[1:00:11] has lost its savior
[1:00:14] and said now evangelical has become more
[1:00:16] of a political label than a spiritual
[1:00:18] one
[1:00:19] and said for evangelicals electing a
[1:00:22] republican to office
[1:00:24] has become their goal
[1:00:28] the goal of an evangelical is to put
[1:00:30] republicans in every office
[1:00:31] and they've lost the goal of evangelism
[1:00:35] that's what it means to be an
[1:00:36] evangelical is not make sure we have a
[1:00:38] republican senator and republican
[1:00:40] congressman
[1:00:41] from our district and make sure we have
[1:00:42] republican presidents our goal as
[1:00:44] evangelicals if you want to use that in
[1:00:46] the pure sense is to evangelize jesus
[1:00:48] christ
[1:00:49] to spread the good news
[1:00:53] why why would we ever lose hope and
[1:00:55] despair
[1:00:57] because of who's in office
[1:01:00] i i i'm willing to apologize if it seems
[1:01:04] that i'm making too much political
[1:01:05] commentary
[1:01:06] i'm not i i'm trying to express that we
[1:01:09] ought to be more concerned about christ
[1:01:12] amen we ought to be more concerned about
[1:01:14] the word spending more time
[1:01:16] in the word of god and realize that
[1:01:19] politics
[1:01:20] in entertainment and sports and fashion
[1:01:23] and pandemic
[1:01:24] numbers and all those things fuels your
[1:01:26] fear not your faith
[1:01:28] and you wonder why you begin to despair
[1:01:30] you wonder why you're thinking this is
[1:01:31] going to happen and that's going to
[1:01:32] happen
[1:01:33] and and mask this and mask that and
[1:01:35] vaccines this and vaccines that and
[1:01:37] you're all worried about that
[1:01:38] stay channeled in the word of god let
[1:01:41] your faith
[1:01:42] sort those things out not your fear
[1:01:46] brother branham says in the message
[1:01:47] broken cisterns
[1:01:49] someone called me not long ago from up
[1:01:51] in the east and said brother branham
[1:01:53] i hear you moved out to arizona and you
[1:01:56] formed a place there where there is
[1:01:57] safety
[1:02:02] praise god i find myself in that quote
[1:02:05] brother john don't you see yourself in
[1:02:07] that quote
[1:02:07] moving from north carolina arizona
[1:02:11] don't you all feel good right now
[1:02:15] and as you know how the message come and
[1:02:17] the lord told me what would happen in
[1:02:18] alaska
[1:02:19] and how down through california it would
[1:02:21] be and it's just been that way
[1:02:23] they said now if that's shaking and
[1:02:25] everything where's the safety zone
[1:02:27] i said there's one safety zone that i
[1:02:29] know of that's in christ
[1:02:32] for those that are in christ will it's
[1:02:34] the only one
[1:02:35] i know
[1:02:39] the only one i know he says is it in
[1:02:42] arizona
[1:02:43] no is it in a particular church in
[1:02:46] arizona
[1:02:47] no no it's in christ
[1:02:51] and see the discrepancy he says we find
[1:02:54] out these statements are both just five
[1:02:55] days apart from each other
[1:02:57] we find out god gave his children his
[1:03:00] word for their defense
[1:03:01] we have no other defense than the word
[1:03:03] of god
[1:03:05] that is our defense there's no bomb
[1:03:09] shelters
[1:03:10] no shelter no bombs no shelters no
[1:03:12] hiding places
[1:03:13] no arizona's or california's or whatever
[1:03:16] it is there's only one defense we have
[1:03:19] and that is the word
[1:03:23] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:03:25] among us which is jesus christ
[1:03:27] he is our only defense being in him
[1:03:31] we are safe
[1:03:35] that's what i'm trusting in amen being
[1:03:37] in him
[1:03:38] we are safe
[1:03:42] job chapter 23 verses 10 to 12
[1:03:46] but he knoweth the way that i take
[1:03:49] and with yet when he has tried me you're
[1:03:52] going to be tried by his word
[1:03:54] what brother and i say the test is the
[1:03:56] greatest thing
[1:03:58] that's ever happened to you why he says
[1:04:00] i shall come forth as gold
[1:04:03] whatever your test is whatever your
[1:04:05] trial is you're going to come forth
[1:04:08] as gold and notice the testimony
[1:04:11] my foot hath held his steps
[1:04:14] what did jesus say take heed there too
[1:04:16] to my words
[1:04:18] that you may be counted worthy to escape
[1:04:21] brethren stand fast and hold the
[1:04:22] traditions that you've been taught
[1:04:23] whether by word or our epistle
[1:04:25] he says my foot hath held his steps his
[1:04:27] way have i kept
[1:04:28] and not declined neither have i gone
[1:04:32] back from the commandments of his lips
[1:04:34] this is your safety zone i have esteemed
[1:04:38] the words of his mouth
[1:04:39] more than my necessary food
[1:04:43] his word was more important to me than
[1:04:46] natural bread
[1:04:48] his word was more important than a green
[1:04:51] chili burrito enchilada style mixed with
[1:04:53] cheese
[1:04:54] from burritos beans and rice on the side
[1:04:58] all in one plate
[1:05:01] it was more necessary than that than the
[1:05:04] machaca
[1:05:05] deep fried tacos from tp
[1:05:09] he said it was more important than that
[1:05:12] i have esteemed the words of
[1:05:14] his mouth i've esteemed the word more
[1:05:17] than my
[1:05:17] necessary he's acknowledging food's
[1:05:19] necessary to live but his word was more
[1:05:21] important what's going to keep you
[1:05:23] amen what should you be worried worried
[1:05:25] about the short of a shortage of chicken
[1:05:28] and beef
[1:05:29] if it comes this winter or the famine
[1:05:31] for hearing the word of god
[1:05:33] i thank god that when then this hour
[1:05:35] there's been a famine for the hearing of
[1:05:37] the word
[1:05:37] he raised up something for us to feed on
[1:05:41] amen and that i esteemed that more
[1:05:43] precious
[1:05:44] more precious than my necessary food
[1:05:48] amen and three kinds of believers
[1:05:50] brother bram says sometimes believers
[1:05:52] are put to the test
[1:05:53] when you have tried me i shall come
[1:05:54] forth as gold he says not sometimes
[1:05:57] every time for every son that cometh to
[1:06:00] god must be chased and tried
[1:06:01] child trained remember the trials the
[1:06:04] dusty roads
[1:06:05] the hot sun of persecution he says but
[1:06:08] the loyalty
[1:06:10] the loyalty of your heart beats that
[1:06:14] material
[1:06:15] until she's ready to go in the mold the
[1:06:18] loyalty of your heart
[1:06:19] he can trust you that's your heartbeat
[1:06:24] god's children is made up correctly on
[1:06:26] his word for their living examples
[1:06:28] and the word of god living through them
[1:06:32] so the trials dusty roads hot sign of
[1:06:34] persecution
[1:06:36] through all of it the loyalty of your
[1:06:38] heart
[1:06:39] beats and all that beating
[1:06:42] is making the material ready that's all
[1:06:46] it can do to you
[1:06:47] whatever's to come it can't beat christ
[1:06:50] out of you
[1:06:51] it can only bring his image more
[1:06:53] perfectly in you
[1:06:55] he says every he says sometimes
[1:06:58] believers are put to the test he says
[1:07:00] not sometimes
[1:07:00] every time what is our test what's the
[1:07:04] primary test we're facing in this hour
[1:07:06] the bride showdown is not physical
[1:07:07] it's not material it's spiritual it's
[1:07:10] not for money it's not for possessions
[1:07:12] it's not health but it's the word
[1:07:14] and where there is where there is a
[1:07:17] challenge
[1:07:18] with clothing where there is a challenge
[1:07:21] with food where there is a challenge
[1:07:23] where i'm going to lay my head
[1:07:25] seek ye first the kingdom of god and his
[1:07:28] righteousness
[1:07:29] and all these things will be added unto
[1:07:32] you amen
[1:07:34] brother abraham said and choose another
[1:07:35] bride sister cassandra if you'd come the
[1:07:37] true church of christ the bride
[1:07:40] is so sold out to him and his promised
[1:07:42] word
[1:07:43] to the very mind that's in christ is in
[1:07:45] you he says what
[1:07:47] a difference what a difference
[1:07:52] you aren't just the dust of this earth
[1:07:56] there's a difference you're made of a
[1:07:59] different material
[1:08:03] a heartbeat in your heart is a material
[1:08:06] that can be molded
[1:08:08] but it says the very boycott will come
[1:08:11] and maybe this kind of leaves it open
[1:08:13] for you know more scriptures and quotes
[1:08:16] on a later time the very boycott will
[1:08:18] come
[1:08:19] but in that hour you promised to take
[1:08:22] your church
[1:08:25] it'll come but who does it work on
[1:08:29] those that are left he says but in that
[1:08:32] hour you promised to take your church
[1:08:34] he said there should nothing bother us
[1:08:36] nothing worries us
[1:08:38] we are his
[1:08:41] do you believe that amen let's stand to
[1:08:44] our feet
