[0:07] I trust you're happy to be in the house
[0:08] of the Lord today.
[0:10] It's nice to see so many of you out uh
[0:12] for fellowship and to sit at the Lord's
[0:15] table and to feast upon his word. And we
[0:18] appreciate your patience as we uh work
[0:20] out certain kinks with different parts
[0:22] of a service. We realize that uh church
[0:25] is for the preaching of the word as our
[0:27] prophet taught us. Then it's not only
[0:29] for the preaching of the word because
[0:31] there's so many different uh ways that
[0:33] we're edified by gathering together and
[0:35] so many different parts that we play
[0:36] ministries that we have within the body
[0:38] of Christ that don't relate solely to
[0:40] preaching. And so we know there's a lot
[0:43] more to it. But then there's so many
[0:44] other things that just are natural
[0:46] logistical um pieces and parts that uh
[0:50] are necessary. And so as we work through
[0:52] some of those as we uh start a church,
[0:54] we appreciate your patience and also
[0:56] just the many of you who've uh supported
[0:58] in different ways and offered to help.
[0:59] We greatly appreciate it. And I'd like
[1:02] to have a meeting this uh afternoon uh
[1:05] or just after service this morning
[1:07] rather um immediately after service once
[1:09] this room has uh emptied out of those
[1:11] who'd like to pray. For the brothers uh
[1:14] who consider themselves to be part of
[1:15] this church uh and who've made the
[1:17] decision to uh to come and to fellowship
[1:20] together. We'd like to just meet briefly
[1:22] um after service uh to discuss one
[1:25] specific subject and that's uh a future
[1:28] space for the church to be on a
[1:30] temporary perhaps permanent basis. So if
[1:32] you could uh just remember that at the
[1:34] end of service, we'd like to meet with
[1:35] some of the brothers and we just want to
[1:37] welcome all those who've come uh to show
[1:40] support from other churches in the
[1:41] valley in Arizona. We appreciate you
[1:43] coming and showing the support. It
[1:45] certainly means a lot to us and it
[1:46] really speaks well of of your churches,
[1:48] your pastors, and even yourself uh to
[1:51] come out and just show the support. And
[1:53] we know that there's many churches that
[1:55] haven't been able to gather at full
[1:56] capacity, even some churches that are
[1:58] streaming only. But we encourage you as
[2:01] your church is able to gather back
[2:02] together uh at full capacity or resumes
[2:05] having church services, we encourage you
[2:07] to to attend those services and show
[2:09] your support. uh you know how hard it is
[2:11] to be away from the body and as the body
[2:13] starts coming back together it would be
[2:15] nice uh for for all of us to be able to
[2:17] assemble where we feel led to be. So we
[2:19] just encourage you to do that but at the
[2:21] same time we're saying thank you for
[2:22] coming and visiting and showing the
[2:24] support. It has meant a lot to us.
[2:26] Matthew chapter 5 start with verse 13
[2:30] and read to verse 16. And I'm wanting to
[2:34] read this as my text to give you some uh
[2:37] indication as to what the burden is on
[2:39] my heart as we're continuing to look at
[2:41] the first chapter of Genesis, the first
[2:43] few verses there. And it it says this in
[2:46] Matthew 5:13, "Ye are the salt of the
[2:50] earth. But if the salt hath lost its
[2:53] savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It
[2:55] is thenforth good for nothing, but to be
[2:57] cast out, and to be trodden under foot
[3:00] of men." And so he is specifically
[3:03] characterizing the believer as having
[3:05] certain attributes and certain a
[3:07] particular ministry. And if you are the
[3:10] salt of the earth and you lose and
[3:12] you're not serving your purpose, then
[3:13] the earth can't be salted. And then he
[3:16] and then he brings it into another
[3:17] characterization. You are the light of
[3:19] the world. A city that is set on a hill
[3:22] cannot be hid. So now he's designated as
[3:24] not only a salt but also as light. And
[3:28] then he describes it in a different
[3:29] capacity, a different way of expressing.
[3:31] You have a city set on a hill, but now
[3:34] he characterizes as neither do men light
[3:36] a candle and put it under a bushel, but
[3:39] on a candlestick, and it giveth light
[3:41] unto all that are in the house. Let your
[3:44] light so shine before men that they may
[3:47] see your good works and glorify your
[3:49] father which is in heaven. If we could
[3:52] bow our heads in a word of prayer. Our
[3:54] gracious heavenly father, as we have
[3:57] gathered together today, we have done so
[3:58] in your name. And doing so, Lord, we
[4:01] believe that you're in our midst
[4:03] according to a promise. And Lord, if
[4:05] you're here, then we believe you come
[4:07] with intent. You come with purpose. And
[4:10] we recognize that your spirit can be
[4:12] poured out upon all flesh, that the rain
[4:15] can fall upon the just and the unjust.
[4:17] But Lord, today we recognize that the
[4:20] rain is for the wheat. That rain has a
[4:22] specific purpose when it falls and it's
[4:24] to bring that seed to maturity. Lord, we
[4:26] believe that your power can move in a
[4:28] service, but we believe that it has a
[4:30] specific intent and a specific purpose.
[4:33] So Lord, as you have moved in the song
[4:35] service, it has increased our faith to
[4:37] believe that you're going to speak to us
[4:39] today. And as you open up this word and
[4:41] rightly divide it to our hearts and your
[4:43] the power of God comes behind it. Lord,
[4:45] we believe it's for the purpose of
[4:47] positioning our faith in this hour that
[4:49] we might overcome all the obstacles set
[4:51] before us. That we might be proved to be
[4:53] your word, that we might be proven to be
[4:55] not like Eve, for this great showdown
[4:58] that is coming, this triumph over death.
[5:00] So each one of us, we yield ourselves to
[5:02] you today, thanking you for your
[5:03] blessings, thanking you for your love
[5:05] and the peace that reigns in our hearts.
[5:07] We love you. We ask that you bless this
[5:09] part of the service. In the name of the
[5:10] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[5:14] and you may be seated.
[5:20] I continue on the subject of in the
[5:22] beginning and uh I'm gonna I want to
[5:26] just jump right into the subject matter
[5:29] and maybe here in just uh uh at some
[5:32] point maybe partway through this uh
[5:34] recap some of the things that we had
[5:36] looked at last Sunday and uh and I don't
[5:39] think anybody who hasn't been here has
[5:41] hasn't heard uh these services I think
[5:44] you'll be able just to fellowship
[5:45] immediately with it as message believers
[5:47] as being students of the Bible not going
[5:49] to be anything uh out of the ordinary,
[5:51] out of the way, just things you're very
[5:53] familiar with. And if you want to look
[5:55] at Genesis 1, I want to begin reading
[5:57] from there again. Genesis 1:es 1 and 2
[6:01] and begin just to focus on a particular
[6:03] phrase that is used here. Uh Genesis 1
[6:07] verse one, in the beginning, God created
[6:09] the heaven and the earth. We realize
[6:11] that there's um this is a tremendous
[6:14] statement and God is beginning his
[6:16] Bible. He's beginning his record, his
[6:18] testimony as man would read it uh by
[6:20] declaring that he has created the heaven
[6:22] and the earth. It says, "And the earth
[6:24] was without form and void, and darkness
[6:27] was upon the face of the deep." Now,
[6:29] we've taken some time to look at the
[6:31] heaven and the earth and what that
[6:32] represents. We've to taken some time to
[6:35] even look out what it means to be
[6:36] without form and void. But now, it says
[6:39] darkness was upon the face of the deep.
[6:41] And last Sunday, we were looking at God
[6:43] dividing light from darkness. and the
[6:45] two great lights that he positioned in
[6:48] the heavens. And I want to just back up
[6:50] and start looking at this darkness
[6:51] because it means obscurity. It means
[6:53] something that is dim or confusing. Uh
[6:56] we could even be used to represent
[6:57] something that is black. And it's
[6:59] suggesting not suggesting it's just
[7:01] telling us that there was nothing
[7:03] distinct. That if you were to look upon
[7:05] the earth, you would see that it would
[7:06] be dark and dismal. It' be a gloomy
[7:08] atmosphere and it wouldn't not you
[7:11] wouldn't be able to discern any
[7:12] particular features or recognize even
[7:14] what substance you were looking at
[7:16] because the entire earth was just a a
[7:19] mixture maybe of mud and water or dirt
[7:21] and water just a a turbid chaos very
[7:24] dark very black without any light any
[7:27] motion and you just see this blob or
[7:29] this mass and it would be gloomy it
[7:31] would be dismal it would be a a dark
[7:33] atmosphere as brother Brandham described
[7:35] it and then it says the spirit Spirit of
[7:37] God moved upon the face of the waters
[7:40] and that word is suggest a a brooding
[7:44] and brother Bannam used that term very
[7:46] often when he referred to this
[7:47] particular passage and some of the
[7:49] commentators actually do the same. They
[7:50] said the spirit of God brooded upon the
[7:52] face of the waters as to impregnate it
[7:54] as a hen upon a an egg to hatch it.
[7:57] That's what the Lord was doing upon the
[7:59] darkness and it was it was and it moved
[8:02] upon the face of the waters. And the
[8:04] Hebrew word that's used for waters is
[8:06] actually translated differently uh than
[8:08] maybe always thinking of the substance
[8:10] of water, but it actually is used uh
[8:12] figuratively as danger or violence or
[8:15] anything that may be transitory. So it's
[8:17] something that's dangerous, something
[8:19] that's violent, something that's
[8:20] transitory, and it moved upon the face
[8:22] of the waters. And it's very interesting
[8:24] in ancient philosophy, beginning with
[8:26] Thales, and I know you're all students
[8:28] of Thales, so this is very common.
[8:30] You're going to finish the quote before
[8:31] I even get there. But they actually
[8:33] believed and Aristotle actually espoused
[8:35] it as well and explained it to some
[8:37] degree how that water was the primary
[8:39] principle of all nature that it would
[8:41] that everything we have today originates
[8:43] from this single substance of water. And
[8:45] so you realize they're on to something
[8:47] but they've missed it
[8:49] because they place it upon water but we
[8:50] know that it was the word of God.
[8:52] And so there's something uh that's being
[8:55] expressed in these passages and
[8:56] something that the word of God is trying
[8:58] to express. And I want to look at how it
[9:00] says there was darkness upon the face of
[9:02] the deep. And that means the oceans or
[9:04] even these waters. And we're living in
[9:08] uh very difficult times. I'd like to say
[9:12] maybe unprecedented times and uh and
[9:15] there could be some ages that might want
[9:17] to take exception to that. But just in
[9:19] terms of the the global chaos and the
[9:21] global darkness, I as I just search it
[9:24] in my mind and it would be something
[9:26] wonderful to fellowship with you on as I
[9:28] think about what is the world is facing
[9:30] today. There may be times when there was
[9:32] a a more deadly pandemic that struck the
[9:34] earth. And there may be times when there
[9:36] was a greater political chaos, but now
[9:39] the the world is flat as it is. I'm not
[9:41] espousing a flat earth. It's just it's
[9:43] used by Freriedman that the world is is
[9:45] is just so small now. shrunk down to
[9:48] where we can ma have access to
[9:50] information and uh you could have a
[9:52] business based out of Mesa a and getting
[9:55] materials from China and you don't have
[9:56] to be a big huge conglomeration or great
[9:58] big you may not even be uh incorporated
[10:01] or an LLC you're just ordering materials
[10:03] or making it and you sell around the
[10:04] world because the world is just shrunk
[10:06] down and we're living in a time where uh
[10:09] if some country is going through
[10:10] something you can know all about it
[10:13] and that um that the the the failure of
[10:15] economies or the the change in political
[10:17] systems just reverberates around the
[10:19] world. So, we're looking at a time right
[10:21] now, whether it be economical or
[10:23] political or even social, even uh
[10:25] physical or medical, uh the whole world
[10:28] is tuned into what everyone else is
[10:30] going through. And we're all being
[10:31] impacted by it at the same time. And if
[10:34] you look into the scripture, we're
[10:35] living in an age that is characterized
[10:37] as the evening time, which itself is
[10:39] gloomy and dark and melancholy, but it's
[10:42] also an age that is characterized by
[10:44] darkness. And even recently, and I wish
[10:46] I I would have noted the date, but we
[10:48] have what is called the doomsday clock.
[10:51] And it's interesting to note that it
[10:52] began in 1947.
[10:54] And the doomsday clock was a way of
[10:57] measuring how close to a total
[10:59] apocalypse and catastrophe the world was
[11:01] to where the world order would just
[11:03] collapse, whether it be by a number of
[11:05] different factors, but primarily because
[11:06] of a nuclear threat. And for it is now
[11:09] inched to a 100 seconds to midnight is
[11:13] the way they characterize it. uh a 100
[11:15] seconds to midnight. It's the closest
[11:17] that we've ever been uh to midnight
[11:20] according to the doomsday clock since
[11:21] they started it. And that's the time
[11:24] that we're living in, the doomsday
[11:26] clock. It's very descriptive. How close
[11:27] are we to doomsday when everything
[11:29] begins to fall apart and uh and there's
[11:31] a a world wars and there's collapse of
[11:33] economies and just this is natural
[11:35] people, natural scientists are saying,
[11:37] "All right, move it up, boys. Uh take 40
[11:39] seconds off the clock or take 20 seconds
[11:41] off the clock. We're a minute 40." uh um
[11:44] um from midnight. That that's incredible
[11:46] that the world recognizes that. In
[11:49] Isaiah 60:2 it says, "For behold, the
[11:52] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[11:55] darkness the people." It's a darkness of
[11:58] ignorance. It's a darkness of
[11:59] superstition. It's a darkness of of
[12:01] idolatry and false doctrine, false
[12:03] worship. It's a darkness uh uh because
[12:05] of man leaning to his own understanding.
[12:08] It's a darkness that pervades
[12:09] everything. uh let's not deceive
[12:12] ourselves and and rec when we see that
[12:15] science is based upon what's called fact
[12:17] and science has a way of going through a
[12:19] very rigorous discipline to achieve a
[12:21] particular result where it's no longer a
[12:23] hypothesis but it's something that can
[12:25] be proven maybe it's becomes a theory
[12:26] and then we come to conclude well this
[12:28] is a fact and facts are stubborn things
[12:31] and we can accept facts but we don't let
[12:33] facts interpret truth
[12:35] uh truth is greater than fact
[12:38] and if fact seems to oppose truth And we
[12:40] just say, well, until I can see the
[12:42] dovetail, until I can see how these fit
[12:44] things fit together, I do not need to
[12:45] deny facts, but I certainly will not
[12:47] devalue truth.
[12:49] And so, it's a darkness that pervades
[12:50] everything. It's even a darkness within
[12:53] science, a darkness within education, a
[12:55] darkness within academics, and all
[12:57] around the world. There's a darkness
[12:58] because the Bible prophesied that
[13:01] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[13:03] darkness to people. Just as there was
[13:06] darkness upon the face of the deep in
[13:07] Genesis 1:2, now it's darkness that
[13:10] covers the whole earth and it's a gross
[13:13] darkness now upon the people.
[13:15] So this is the the spirits of mankind.
[13:17] These are the the minds of the people.
[13:20] And Paul in 2 Corinthians 4:es 3-4 says,
[13:23] "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to
[13:26] them that are lost." Now that seems to
[13:28] be a very uh rough thing to say, brother
[13:30] Paul, and I don't even know if we could
[13:32] get away with that ourselves anymore.
[13:33] So, I'm glad we can just quote the
[13:35] scripture. Paul is basically saying,
[13:36] "Well, if you don't believe this, you're
[13:37] lost."
[13:39] Right? I mean, isn't that what the
[13:40] Amplified would say or the today's Bible
[13:43] and just put it in plain language? If
[13:45] you're not picking up what I'm laying
[13:46] down, you're not elect. And that's what
[13:48] Paul is saying. But if our gospel be
[13:50] hid, it is hid to them that are lost. In
[13:52] whom the God of this world, so there is
[13:55] a God of this evil age. There is a God
[13:57] of this world. There is a Satan who's
[13:59] been building in Eden through 6,000
[14:01] years. And I want you to ponder that as
[14:03] we look at these characteristics of the
[14:04] end time that this is Satan's
[14:07] achievement
[14:09] that in in one sense for these next
[14:11] several minutes as we begin to lay out
[14:13] just how dark the world is. Satan's over
[14:14] there going right on. This is what I
[14:17] wanted all along. This is what I set out
[14:19] to achieve. This is his Eden. This is
[14:20] the climax of his Eden. And Satan is
[14:23] characterized as the god of this world.
[14:25] He's the prince of the power of the air.
[14:27] And he says, "The God of this world hath
[14:28] blinded the minds of them which believe
[14:31] not." So now this is gross darkness upon
[14:33] the people. It's a blind mind. It's a
[14:35] blind spirituality. It's a lack of
[14:37] discernment. It's a lack of common
[14:39] sense. It's a lack of recognizing right
[14:41] from wrong. He says, "Lest the light of
[14:43] the glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[14:46] image of God should shine unto them."
[14:49] And so they're blinded. So that even
[14:51] though light would be shining, they're
[14:53] unable to apprehend it. They're unable
[14:55] to comprehend it because Satan has
[14:57] blinded their minds, blinded their ears,
[14:59] blind uh their doled their hearing,
[15:01] dulled their sight to be able to receive
[15:03] the light. And that's what's being
[15:05] expressed where it says, "Gross darkness
[15:06] is upon the people and darkness is
[15:08] covering the earth." In Revelations
[15:11] 16:es 10 to 11, it says, "And the fifth
[15:14] angel poured out his vial upon the seat
[15:16] of the beast." And now I'm not not
[15:19] getting into this uh fifth angel and
[15:22] this vial that's poured out, but notice
[15:23] how it characterizes the beast. And his
[15:26] kingdom was full of darkness. And they
[15:28] gnawed their tongues for pain. So
[15:31] Satan's kingdom is a king kingdom of
[15:33] darkness. Satan's kingdom is a kingdom
[15:35] of death. And now it's describing his
[15:39] kingdom is full of darkness. And they
[15:41] nod their tongues for pain. Now notice
[15:43] it says verse 11, and blasphemed the God
[15:46] of heaven because of their pains and
[15:48] their sores and repented not of their
[15:50] deeds.
[15:51] So now you have a people that are so
[15:53] blinded and so dull in their spiritual
[15:56] perception that instead of just
[15:58] repenting, they actually blame God.
[16:01] And so the Satan's kingdom is full of
[16:03] darkness. And because there's darkness,
[16:05] there's pain and and there's sores. And
[16:07] instead of repenting, they shake their
[16:09] fist at God. This is just describing how
[16:11] pitiful mankind has become in the end.
[16:15] The very characterization of the age
[16:17] that we're living in, the Leodysian
[16:18] church age in Revelations 3:1 17 is
[16:21] described as not knowing that we are
[16:23] wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and
[16:26] naked. They believe they're rich and
[16:29] increase with goods and have need of
[16:30] nothing. But it says, "And you don't
[16:32] know that you're wretched, miserable,
[16:34] poor, blind, and naked."
[16:37] don't realize they're enduring toils and
[16:39] troubles. They're afflicted. The
[16:41] scriptur is actually saying they're very
[16:42] unhappy. They're very uncomfortable. But
[16:44] through cognitive dissonance or whatever
[16:46] psychological process, they're trying to
[16:48] convince themselves everything is great,
[16:50] right?
[16:52] Everything is wonderful. And never
[16:54] underestimate the capacity of delusion
[16:56] to cause people who are absolutely
[16:58] miserable to convince themselves that
[17:00] everything's great, everything's fine,
[17:02] I've never been happier. Right.
[17:05] The Bible says in Luke 21 25 and 26 and
[17:09] brother Brandham identifies this
[17:10] scripture for the time this time that
[17:12] we're living in right now says and there
[17:14] shall be signs in the sun and in the
[17:16] moon and in the stars. Now think of that
[17:18] as there's the the the sun the moon and
[17:21] the stars were given for signs given for
[17:23] seasons. Now he's saying there's going
[17:24] to be signs again in the sun and the
[17:26] moon and the stars. It brings us back to
[17:27] Genesis chapter 1 in that very verse
[17:29] where these things come to uh come to be
[17:32] explained. says, "And upon the earth
[17:34] distress of nations with perplexity, the
[17:38] sea and the waves roaring." So now the
[17:40] sea waves ponder this as it said the
[17:42] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[17:44] and these waters were turbid and they're
[17:46] turultuous and everything was chaotic.
[17:48] Now again it's distress among nations,
[17:50] perplexity, sea and waves roaring. Men's
[17:54] hearts failing them for fear and for
[17:57] looking after those things which are
[17:58] coming on the earth. for the powers of
[18:00] heaven shall be shaken. There's such a
[18:03] dreadful expectation. There's such a
[18:05] hopelessness that it's actually causing
[18:07] human beings hearts to just quit.
[18:11] Such a fear coming upon the earth
[18:12] looking at economics and politics and
[18:14] everything that's taking place and it's
[18:16] wearing down the resolve of man. It's
[18:18] weakening their emotions. It's breaking
[18:20] their spirits. Distress among nations,
[18:22] perplexity, a tumultuous societies and
[18:26] and regions and countries and men's
[18:28] hearts. and failing for fear for all the
[18:30] things that are coming upon the earth.
[18:33] It's a darkness that covers the earth, a
[18:35] gross darkness upon the people. The very
[18:37] language that's used to describe the
[18:39] darkness of the end time is a darkness
[18:40] so thick it can be felt.
[18:43] It's a darkness so thick it begins to
[18:45] describe one as their spirit is being
[18:47] bowed down. As it begins to say people's
[18:49] hearts are failing them for fear,
[18:51] people's spirits are becoming affected
[18:53] just by the darkness. Not not by
[18:56] engaging the darkness. not even
[18:58] succumbing maybe to the signs and the
[19:00] things that are going on around us, but
[19:01] just by the mere thought of it. A a and
[19:04] I say this very pointedly. Uh we do not
[19:07] have to have ever been infected by COVID
[19:10] 19 to have felt its impact. And and I'm
[19:13] not just saying economically or
[19:15] socially, but the fear that goes with it
[19:18] to me is greater than the disease.
[19:21] And God bless you if you have allergies
[19:23] because you wake up every morning
[19:24] thinking I got every symptom of COVID
[19:26] 19.
[19:27] A and and if it sounds suspiciously
[19:30] specific, I'm describing my routine
[19:32] sometimes. Honey, do I feel hot? Taking
[19:34] my temperature. It's allergies. It's the
[19:36] way you felt your whole life. But now
[19:38] there's a there's a there's something
[19:39] out there because you you're always
[19:40] suspicious. You're always wondering. And
[19:42] now when everybody some someone sneezes,
[19:44] you don't say bless you. You say COVID
[19:46] 19,
[19:48] right? That's exactly what you do now.
[19:49] You just you step back and you say COVID
[19:51] 19. And they're supposed to say excuse
[19:53] me, thank you. And uh I saw a video one
[19:56] time of somebody who was so nervous they
[19:58] were on TV they sneezed and they said
[19:59] bless you and then they said thank you.
[20:02] So they blessed themselves and thank
[20:03] themselves. That's how nervous they
[20:04] were. But that's this is such a fear in
[20:08] the world today. And if all we did is
[20:10] track co 19, if all you did was looking
[20:13] at the polls of who's leading for the
[20:14] presidential election. If all of you
[20:16] spent your time the last 5 days
[20:18] researching who's a possible uh
[20:20] nomination for the Supreme Court vacancy
[20:23] and then looked at the responses to what
[20:24] the Democrats could do in the next time
[20:26] the Senate gathers together, then you'd
[20:29] just be driving yourself crazy.
[20:30] Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green
[20:32] Party, Tea Party, doesn't matter. You
[20:34] would be driving yourself crazy
[20:37] because those things have a weight.
[20:39] There's a fear that's associated with
[20:40] it. It's this is an age that is
[20:42] characterized by fear.
[20:46] in Exodus 10:es 21-23. Uh, does anybody
[20:50] anybody believe we're in the third
[20:51] Exodus?
[20:53] We're in a third Exodus. We see the very
[20:55] types and signs and shadows, the very
[20:57] things repeating themselves. It says
[20:58] this in the third exodus, "And the Lord
[21:00] said unto Moses, stretch out thy hand
[21:02] toward heaven, that there may be
[21:04] darkness over the land of Egypt, even
[21:06] darkness which may be felt."
[21:09] Now, in the first Exodus, this was a
[21:11] physical darkness that was so dark it
[21:14] could be felt. That's heavy.
[21:18] Now, we've got to look at it in this
[21:19] sense. This is a spiritual darkness. And
[21:21] it's a spiritual darkness to the same
[21:23] degree and intensity that it was
[21:24] physically dark then. Now, it's
[21:27] spiritually just as dark. And then they
[21:30] would not have even been able to see
[21:31] their hand in front of their face. It
[21:33] was so dark that it was pervasive. It it
[21:35] it exuded everywhere. It saturated
[21:38] everything. It was a darkness that could
[21:40] be felt. That's what the Bible is
[21:41] saying. Now, in this third Exodus, the
[21:44] spiritual darkness is at the same
[21:46] intensity and degree to the same extent
[21:48] that people did not have physical
[21:50] eyesight to see beyond their themselves
[21:52] and did not have physical eyesight to
[21:54] discern anything around them. Now, today
[21:56] spiritually, there's gross darkness upon
[21:59] the people, and they're just as blind
[22:01] spiritually.
[22:03] And Moses stretched forth his hand
[22:04] toward heaven, and there was a thick
[22:06] darkness in all the land of Egypt. Three
[22:08] days they saw not one another.
[22:12] They couldn't see one another. It was so
[22:14] dark. It says, "And neither rose any
[22:16] from his place for three days." It was
[22:18] so dark they were paralyzed seated
[22:21] wherever they rem.
[22:24] They couldn't get up. And then it says,
[22:26] "But," and I love what the scripture
[22:28] says, "but." But all the children of
[22:30] Israel had light in their dwellings.
[22:33] Amen.
[22:34] Now, this is often referred to in the
[22:35] message as goan, and we could use that
[22:37] type of goan. What's beautiful here is
[22:40] it wasn't just relegated to a particular
[22:43] physical location in Egypt. It was
[22:45] related to the children of Israel.
[22:47] Do you catch that? Didn't just say there
[22:49] was light in Gan, but rather there was
[22:51] light wherever a child of Israel was
[22:53] gathered. Wherever their dwelling was,
[22:56] there was light. Amen.
[22:57] If you were a servant in in an
[22:59] Egyptian's house and you were a slave in
[23:01] Egyptian's house and maybe you were just
[23:03] right next door uh uh uh uh to Pharaoh
[23:06] and you were in that house, all the
[23:07] Egyptians sat in gross darkness,
[23:10] paralyzed by fear, unable to move, but
[23:12] you had light in your dwelling.
[23:15] You could go about and maybe just uh
[23:18] dramatize it, maybe you could walk
[23:20] around the house to go make a bologn
[23:22] sandwich and there's your master just
[23:23] sitting there on the couch
[23:25] staring straight and you walk by like is
[23:28] there someone here? And you're walking
[23:29] by, hey, you know, why are you darkness
[23:34] world groping in darkness, a dark time,
[23:36] a chaotic time? But yet to the children
[23:38] of Israel, they had light in their
[23:39] dwellings. So just remember if if it
[23:41] seems really dark what I'm preaching
[23:43] you're you're you're perceptive because
[23:44] I'm preaching on darkness.
[23:47] If if it seems very negative and very
[23:48] gloomy and very chaotic it's because
[23:50] those are the very words that I'm using.
[23:52] But also remember this I'm this is not
[23:55] the message is not a negative message.
[23:58] The preaching of the gospel is neg never
[24:00] negative. It is always positive. We
[24:03] preach a positive gospel. Men of God
[24:05] today are not wielding a sword to cut
[24:07] you and to hurt you, to bring harm and
[24:09] to bring loss. But the sword is wielded
[24:12] for a positive benefit, a positive
[24:13] effect. We have a positive gospel.
[24:16] The best way to be against something is
[24:18] to be for something. And so I don't want
[24:20] to preach against a lie. I just want to
[24:22] preach truth.
[24:23] And so if we if it seems like we're
[24:25] emphasizing the darkness of Leodysa a
[24:27] little bit too much, just look at where
[24:28] I'm headed now. All the children of
[24:30] Israel had light. So there is light.
[24:33] Despite the darkness, there is light.
[24:36] And once again, the world is in a
[24:38] chaotic darkness.
[24:40] What we're living in right now is chaos,
[24:42] darkness, depravity, disease,
[24:46] a darkness so thick it can be felt, a
[24:48] fulfillment of Isaiah 60:2, darkness
[24:50] covering the earth, gross darkness, the
[24:52] people. in Revelations 17:es 1 and
[24:56] verse1 15 as we've already used chapter
[24:58] 16 to look at how the kingdom of this
[25:01] beast was full of darkness.
[25:04] Now it says in Revelation 17:1 and there
[25:07] came one of the seven angels which had
[25:09] the seven vials and talked with me
[25:11] saying unto me come hither I will show
[25:14] thee unto thee the judgment of the great
[25:16] that sitth upon many waters. Now,
[25:20] we've been uh you've been taught well uh
[25:22] from the message of the hour, your
[25:24] pastors, different ones, the men of God
[25:25] who've been teaching on these things for
[25:27] decades. We understand who the great
[25:29] is. We understand her position in
[25:31] scripture. But now it says, "She siteth
[25:33] upon many waters. She's placed in a
[25:35] position of rule and authority over many
[25:37] waters." Then in verse 15, it says, "And
[25:40] he said unto me, the waters which thou
[25:42] sawest where the sitth are peoples
[25:45] and multitudes and nations and tongues."
[25:49] So when the Bible tells us that the
[25:51] world has come that this is an age of
[25:53] darkness the world is full of darkness
[25:55] that darkness shall cover the earth and
[25:57] gross darkness the people then once
[25:59] again we could say that darkness is upon
[26:01] the face of the deep once again there's
[26:04] gross darkness upon the waters as waters
[26:06] represents people multitudes nations and
[26:09] tongues the world is once again
[26:11] overwhelmed with darkness overcome with
[26:14] distress it's it's bound down by
[26:16] confusion there is complete and total
[26:19] spiritual darkness in the world.
[26:22] There is no light in Leodysia.
[26:26] There is no light in the world today. We
[26:29] can't. In other words, you say, "Well,
[26:30] brother Aaron, I I'm trying to
[26:32] understand what your point is and
[26:33] without me maybe giving away which
[26:35] direction I'm going." You can't go to
[26:37] the world to get light.
[26:42] Brother Brandham writes this in the
[26:43] church age book. It's chapter nine where
[26:46] he's described in Leodysia.
[26:48] He says God says this church of the
[26:50] Leodysian age is wretched. The word
[26:53] comes from two Greek words which means
[26:55] endure in trial. It has nothing to do
[26:58] with the trials that come to a true
[26:59] Christian. For God describes a Christian
[27:02] in trial as blessed and his attitude one
[27:05] of joy. Whereas this description is
[27:07] phrased as wretched and miserable.
[27:10] That's instructive.
[27:12] Then as a child of God and I I'll just
[27:14] I'll admit this. It's maybe not good to
[27:16] be per too personal as a minister, but
[27:19] uh I I look back with regret as to how
[27:22] I've endured trials. I've generally
[27:24] tried to signal that I'm miserable
[27:27] in some way.
[27:30] But the Christian ought to endure it
[27:32] with an attitude of joy.
[27:36] That that this is what pleases God. How
[27:38] can I prove my love to him? by
[27:40] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[27:43] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[27:45] come to pass. And over the last couple
[27:48] years, it dawned on me, I don't have to
[27:50] engage in a guessing game and trying to
[27:52] figure out which trial was in his
[27:55] wisdom.
[27:57] If you're going through it in his
[27:59] wisdom, he has allowed it to come to
[28:01] pass.
[28:02] I don't need to say, "Oh no, this is
[28:04] happening with my child. Oh no, this is
[28:05] happening with my job." Lord, is this in
[28:07] your wisdom? Is or is this out of your
[28:09] wisdom? Is this something else? No. If
[28:11] you're going through it, he has in his
[28:13] wisdom allowed it to come to pass.
[28:15] Therefore, there's only one option.
[28:19] If you try to keep it open that, well,
[28:20] maybe God didn't allow this in his
[28:22] wisdom. Maybe this is God allowing it in
[28:24] his own unwisdom.
[28:25] Then it gives yourself the option of to
[28:27] be sad and to be wretched and to be
[28:28] miserable, but rather every trial that
[28:30] you endure, God has allowed it in his
[28:33] wisdom. Therefore, you only have one
[28:34] option as to how to conduct yourself. I
[28:36] must conduct myself with joy
[28:38] in the midst of this trial. I will
[28:40] conduct myself with joy. Well, how can
[28:42] you do it? This is the wisdom of God.
[28:44] Amen.
[28:45] God must have something he's trying to
[28:47] accomplish. God must have something he's
[28:49] trying to bring out of me. God must have
[28:50] something bigger than just the picture
[28:52] I'm looking at. Therefore, I will have a
[28:55] joy set before me. Maybe it's not joyous
[28:58] for the moment. Maybe you're unable to
[28:59] find a joy in the difficulty. But do as
[29:01] Christ did for the joy which is set
[29:04] before me. God in his wisdom has allowed
[29:06] this to take place. Therefore, I'll
[29:08] conduct myself with joy even if it's set
[29:11] before me,
[29:12] even if it's future. So, this is
[29:15] instructive. We've got to conduct
[29:16] ourselves with joy, an attitude of joy.
[29:18] But now, the Bible's describing Leodysia
[29:21] as wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and
[29:23] naked. So, this cannot be an enduring or
[29:25] a toiling of of the righteous.
[29:30] He says, "How strange in this age of
[29:32] plenty, this age of progress, in this
[29:35] age of abundance, how can there be
[29:37] trials?" Well, now it is strange. But in
[29:40] this age of plenty and opportunity, when
[29:42] everyone has so much and there's so much
[29:45] more to be had, what with all the
[29:48] inventions to do our work and so many
[29:51] things to give us pleasure, suddenly
[29:54] you would not think this was written in
[29:56] ' 61 or ' 62. Right?
[30:00] If you apply that to the time we're
[30:01] living in now, it's even more
[30:04] astounding and more applicable
[30:07] and we we can all testify
[30:10] that. Yeah. I I I bought that as for
[30:12] convenience. I bought that to save time.
[30:14] And what did it do? It freed you up to
[30:15] get something else to take your time.
[30:18] Suddenly we find now with all these
[30:20] things to do or work and things to give
[30:22] us pleasure. Suddenly we find mental
[30:25] illness taking such a toll as to alarm
[30:27] the nation. We're more alarmed than ever
[30:29] when everybody ought to be happy with
[30:31] really nothing to be unhappy about.
[30:33] Millions are taking sedatives at night,
[30:36] pet pills in the morning.
[30:39] I would really love to go back and find
[30:41] out what the data was then
[30:44] because he's characterizing the age
[30:47] then. This is even more so now,
[30:52] exponentially more so. You have to take
[30:54] something to go to sleep at night.
[30:55] Something to pepp you up in the morning
[30:57] a and to get you through the day. He
[30:59] says rushing to doctors enter entering
[31:01] institutions and trying to drown out
[31:03] unknown fears by alcohol and you name it
[31:06] any other kind of stimulant. Yes, this
[31:09] age boasts of its tremendous stores of
[31:11] worldly goods. But the people are less
[31:13] happy than ever. Amen.
[31:16] And and and and scientists certainly the
[31:20] uh uh those in behavioral economics have
[31:22] determined this have shown these the
[31:25] heristics and the human behavior and the
[31:26] biases that they're subject to how that
[31:29] the more choices you have the less happy
[31:31] you are when you make a choice.
[31:34] If I just said what do you want roast
[31:35] beef or turkey? Whatever you got you'd
[31:37] be happy with. But if I gave you just a
[31:39] whole gamut of meats to choose from, you
[31:42] you choose, well,
[31:44] I I guess I'll have the turkey. And then
[31:46] you're like, I just don't know if I
[31:47] should have got the turkey.
[31:49] I should have got the vegan turkey.
[31:52] The the Impossible Duck. That's what I
[31:54] should have. I should have tried the
[31:55] Impossible Duck. And you wouldn't be
[31:57] happy. But if you only had two choices,
[31:58] you'd walk away saying, "This is Yeah,
[32:00] I'm happy with it." Right? So now we
[32:01] have so many choices. They actually have
[32:04] places that are dedicated just to tea.
[32:08] 32 different flavors of tea
[32:11] and and I think they're getting coffee
[32:12] shops now where all they're dedicated
[32:14] just to coffee and things like that. I
[32:16] know some of you thinking, "Really,
[32:17] Brother Aaron?"
[32:19] I just say to make a point, you just
[32:20] don't go in and ask for a pair of
[32:21] Levis's anymore. And they say, "What
[32:23] size?" They do you do you want it
[32:25] washed, unwashed, broken in, unbroken
[32:28] in, tapered, untapered? You know, you
[32:30] you got 80 different choices. You're
[32:31] like, "I just want a pair of jeans."
[32:36] This age boasts of its spiritual
[32:37] attainments, but the people are less
[32:39] sure of themselves than ever.
[32:40] This age boasts of better moral values,
[32:43] right?
[32:44] Think how moral everyone is, how ethical
[32:47] a how people's rights and we don't want
[32:50] to offend and we don't want to do this
[32:51] and we don't want to do that and and
[32:52] it's become completely chaotic.
[32:56] So they boast about better morals and
[32:58] it's more corrupt than any age since the
[33:00] flood. Talks about its knowledge and
[33:02] science, but it's fighting a losing
[33:03] battle in all fields. For the human mind
[33:05] and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or
[33:08] keep a breast with all the changes that
[33:10] have come upon the earth. In one
[33:12] generation, we've gone all the way from
[33:14] the horse and buggy age to the space
[33:16] age. And we are proud and boastful about
[33:18] it. But inside is a dark void cavern.
[33:21] Amen.
[33:22] Darkness, void, obscurity, without form.
[33:27] Notice how brother Bram is describing
[33:29] Leodysia with Genesis 1:2 terms.
[33:34] A void cavern that is crying out in
[33:36] torment. And without a known reason,
[33:37] men's hearts are failing for fear. And
[33:39] the world is so darkened that this age
[33:42] could well be called the age of
[33:44] neurotics. It's the only way to describe
[33:46] the way people are acting.
[33:48] It boasts but it cannot back it up. It
[33:50] cries peace and there is no peace. It
[33:52] cries it has a great amplitude of all
[33:55] things but it keeps burning with desire
[33:57] like an unsatisfied fire.
[33:59] There is no peace sayith my God to the
[34:01] wicked. They are miserable.
[34:04] Amen.
[34:07] This is the time that we're living in.
[34:10] This is the age that we exist within.
[34:13] Leodysia.
[34:15] The earth. Genesis 1:2. The earth was
[34:17] without form and void. Brother is saying
[34:19] it's a dark void cavern. Darkness upon
[34:22] the age. Gross darkness upon the people.
[34:25] It says and darkness was upon the face
[34:27] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[34:31] upon the face of the waters.
[34:34] signifying that on in a time when the
[34:37] world returned to the very same
[34:38] condition, there's still a God that can
[34:41] move upon the darkness. There's still a
[34:43] God that can move upon people.
[34:45] And what began to happen in Genesis 1:2,
[34:49] God began to separate the mixed parts by
[34:51] his quickening power. And God was
[34:53] transforming the void. God was
[34:56] transforming the chaos. And God was
[34:58] transforming the confusion. And only God
[35:00] could take a void and bring something.
[35:02] Only God could take darkness and
[35:04] separate it and bring forth light. Only
[35:06] God could take something without without
[35:08] form and make it beautiful.
[35:10] Brother Bram says in God's power to
[35:12] transform. At the very beginning of the
[35:14] one he preached on September 11th, 1965,
[35:17] he says in Genesis chapter 1, this world
[35:19] was without form and it was void.
[35:21] Darkness was upon the earth, nothing but
[35:24] complete chaos. And when this world was
[35:26] in that condition, the spirit of God
[35:29] moved upon the face of the waters and
[35:31] the entire picture was changed from a
[35:34] total chaos to a garden of Eden.
[35:37] God's still going to do it to this
[35:39] earth.
[35:40] God's still going to do it to this very
[35:43] earth, this very world. And one thing
[35:45] I've been studying in parallel to these
[35:47] things and I would love to be able to
[35:49] share it uh maybe soon is what Burbam in
[35:52] future home is showing that there's a
[35:53] parallel. What God does to the earth, he
[35:55] does to the individual. And here this
[35:58] entire picture is changed from a total
[36:00] chaos to a garden of Eden. This world is
[36:02] going to be brought back under
[36:03] possession again. This atmosphere is
[36:05] going to be purged. All the sin is going
[36:07] to be burned out of it. And the same God
[36:09] that can take the chaos of this world
[36:11] and turn it into an Eden is the same God
[36:14] that can move upon your life, your
[36:16] family, your home, whatever your
[36:18] situation may be, and bring a beautiful
[36:20] Eden.
[36:20] Amen.
[36:21] He said, "That's the transforming power
[36:23] of God that can take something that's
[36:25] nothing and make something wonderful out
[36:27] of it."
[36:28] There might be somebody sitting here
[36:30] today who has just recently confessed,
[36:31] "I'm just nothing. I'm just a nobody."
[36:34] Well, you're in a perfect condition for
[36:35] a God that can take something out of
[36:37] nothing.
[36:40] Can take something that's nothing and
[36:41] make something wonderful out of it.
[36:44] So, as the spirit of God began to move
[36:46] upon the face of the waters in verse
[36:47] three, Genesis chapter 1:3, we'll read
[36:50] to verse 5. And God said, now this is as
[36:53] he's moving, this is the the power of
[36:56] God, this transforming power. Now,
[36:58] there's a voice that speaks, let there
[37:00] be light. And there was light. And God
[37:03] saw the light that it was good. And God
[37:06] divided the light from the darkness and
[37:08] called the light day. And the darkness
[37:10] he called night, and the evening and the
[37:12] morning were the first day. Now, this is
[37:15] where I just want to review for a few
[37:17] moments some of the principles that we
[37:19] expressed last Sunday. Brother Bam goes
[37:22] to great lengths in the sermons he's
[37:23] preaching in shalom. There's a man here
[37:25] who can turn on the light. uh uh several
[37:27] services at the end of 63 and the
[37:29] beginning of 64 where he's showing that
[37:31] light came by the word
[37:35] and that without light nothing can live.
[37:37] So there's light and life are associated
[37:40] together. So you have to look at these
[37:42] three principles. There's word there's
[37:43] light and there's life. Where there's
[37:45] life it had to come by the word. Where
[37:47] there's life it had to come by the
[37:49] light. The light came by the word. These
[37:50] are ways even describe the word. The
[37:52] word is life.
[37:54] The word is light. So these are
[37:56] manifestations or expression. The word
[37:58] speaks and there's light and because
[37:59] there's light it brings the life out of
[38:01] the seed. And brother Brandon El goes to
[38:04] great uh lengths to explain that
[38:06] principle in great detail. And then the
[38:09] Bible characterizes the light as good.
[38:12] So it's not just light but the Bible
[38:14] says that the light was good. God saw
[38:17] the light and now God is actually
[38:19] characterizing his creation for the
[38:21] first time. There was without form and
[38:23] void and darkness. But now once the
[38:25] spirit of God begins to move upon
[38:26] something and his word goes forth and it
[38:28] manifests, God says that's good. So
[38:31] what's good? The manifestation of the
[38:32] word. That's good. That's what we think
[38:34] is good. That's what we enjoy. That's
[38:36] what we relate to is the manifestation
[38:38] of the word of God. And once it's
[38:40] revealed to you, that's the vindication.
[38:43] If anybody ever asks you for the
[38:45] vindication of the message, you could
[38:47] clarify. Are you asking for my personal
[38:50] personally what has vindicated the
[38:51] message to me? If they say yes, then you
[38:53] say, "It's my revelation of the word
[38:55] that is the vindication." And if you
[38:58] want vindication, you're going to have
[38:59] to ask God for revelation.
[39:01] Because the only thing I can give you is
[39:03] an education.
[39:06] If you want an education, I can give you
[39:08] one. But if you want a revelation,
[39:09] you're going to have to ask God for one.
[39:12] And your revelation is your vindication.
[39:15] You're tied to it. You're anchored to
[39:16] it.
[39:17] You can't be separated from it.
[39:20] And
[39:20] that's what we stand upon is revelation.
[39:23] And that's what we desire others to
[39:24] receive is a revelation.
[39:26] We don't offer legislation. We want
[39:29] revelation.
[39:30] Amen.
[39:32] So then there is this is characterized
[39:35] as good and then God immediately divides
[39:38] light from darkness. And what has he
[39:40] done in that very statement? God saw the
[39:42] light that was good. And as soon as he
[39:44] has good, he divides light from darkness
[39:46] because light is good. Darkness is bad.
[39:48] That's right.
[39:50] Darkness represents death. It represents
[39:52] all these uh uh you could use an
[39:54] alliteration to come all sorts of dwords
[39:56] to describe what death is and what
[39:58] darkness is and depravity and disease
[40:00] and depression. Brother Bam says in
[40:02] oneness, what is Satan? Anything
[40:04] contrary to the word. He doesn't have
[40:06] salvation. He doesn't have light. His
[40:08] kingdom is darkness and the end thereof
[40:10] is death. Darkness and death are Satan's
[40:13] kingdom. Remember what the Bible said
[40:15] the beast the kingdom of the beast was?
[40:18] It was full of darkness and what
[40:20] followed was pain. What followed was
[40:23] blasphemy. What followed was sores and a
[40:25] lack of repentance. That's what is in
[40:27] Satan's kingdom. So God is wanting us to
[40:30] realize at the very beginning he raises
[40:32] into view that there's light and there's
[40:34] darkness. The light is good and the
[40:36] darkness is bad. So then he repeats a
[40:39] similar image in Genesis 1 16 to18. Says
[40:44] and God made and again this is just kind
[40:46] of review of some things. It says God
[40:48] made two great lights. Now recognize
[40:51] there's two and they're both great.
[40:54] Says the greater light to rule the day
[40:57] and the lesser light to rule the night.
[41:00] He made the stars also. And God set them
[41:03] in the firmament of the heaven to give
[41:05] light upon the earth and to rule over
[41:08] the day and over the night and to divide
[41:10] the light from the darkness. And God saw
[41:13] that it was good. So again, whenever God
[41:16] is dividing light from darkness, there's
[41:18] a it's characterized as good because
[41:20] it's separating and distinguishing. And
[41:23] what we see in these two great lights,
[41:25] one to rule over the day, which is the
[41:26] sun, one to rule over the night, which
[41:29] is the moon. And brother Bam called that
[41:31] just like bride and bridegroom.
[41:34] So the the the the sun and the moon
[41:37] being positioned in the very beginning,
[41:39] God was once again foreshadowing that
[41:41] there are two great lights. You have
[41:44] groom and bride.
[41:45] Amen.
[41:46] And he set the sun to rule over the day.
[41:50] And that is called the greater light in
[41:52] the scripture. We know Christ is the son
[41:54] of God. He is that greater light. It's
[41:56] represented as the sun. And then the
[41:58] lesser light is the moon which
[41:59] represents the bride. But remember,
[42:01] she's still great.
[42:02] Amen.
[42:03] Amen.
[42:03] Because it's called two great lights.
[42:05] Amen.
[42:06] In Isaiah chapter 9:2, speaking about
[42:08] Christ, the people that walked in
[42:10] darkness have seen a great light. They
[42:12] that dwell in the land of the shadow of
[42:14] death. Upon them hath the light shined.
[42:17] And so John came testifying. He wasn't
[42:20] the light. He came testifying of the
[42:22] light. So this is great light had come
[42:25] to the people of Israel. Great light had
[42:27] sprung up to those who sat in the
[42:28] regions of darkness under the shadow of
[42:30] death. And this is Christ the son of God
[42:33] as this great light. But there was
[42:35] another light and that is the moon.
[42:38] Amen.
[42:38] And that moon is represented as the
[42:40] bride. Brother Bam says, "And speak to
[42:43] the rock in Genesis when God made the
[42:45] sun and made the moon." Now the moon is
[42:47] the wife of the sun. Now when the sun
[42:50] goes away, the moon reflects the light
[42:52] of the sun on the earth. So there's a
[42:55] representation. We realize that there's
[42:57] different ways that you can type things.
[42:59] Uh brother Adam even goes back and talks
[43:01] about how the Eve is a type of the of
[43:03] the of the foolish of the in this
[43:05] end time. There's different ways that
[43:07] you can type different things, but
[43:09] there's often this other side where
[43:10] says, "On one hand, she's filthy. On the
[43:12] other hand, she's pure."
[43:14] So, there's a woman can represent
[43:15] different things. We'll see that the
[43:17] moon can represent different things, but
[43:19] the moon is the wife to the sun. And
[43:21] what's beautiful when you go back and
[43:23] you look at how God with intent arranged
[43:26] it in the beginning, he used the sun,
[43:28] the greater light. And you might say,
[43:30] "Brother, this is just pure logic. This
[43:31] is just physics. The greater light to
[43:33] rule over the day." But then he had a
[43:36] characterization that he wanted to give
[43:38] the moon as the wife or or the bride.
[43:41] She is to rule over the night. So the
[43:44] bride's calling, the prophecy from the
[43:46] beginning is that she would be
[43:48] positioned to rule over darkness.
[43:51] That she would be positioned to rule
[43:53] over death. That she would not be
[43:55] chained. She would not be oppressed. She
[43:57] would not succumb to the darkness. But
[43:59] God in the beginning said, "I am one
[44:02] day." Before Satan had actually caused
[44:05] death to come, God hung a moon in the
[44:07] sky that said, "One day death is going
[44:10] to be defeated by her. One day darkness
[44:12] is going to be placed under her her
[44:14] feet."
[44:15] Even in Genesis 3:15 when he said and
[44:18] and he shall crush your head, he was
[44:20] thinking she
[44:22] cuz I hung her in the moon. I hung the
[44:24] moon in the sky to represent she will
[44:27] rule over darkness. She will rule over
[44:29] death. She will rule over everything
[44:31] that is bad and foul.
[44:34] Be made subject to her.
[44:37] So from the beginning, that's been her
[44:38] position. And then we read how in Isaiah
[44:41] 30 26. Now this is where you realize my
[44:45] only God could hide something like this.
[44:48] Says, "Moreover, the light of the moon
[44:50] shall be as the light of the sun."
[44:54] And then it says, "The light of the sun
[44:55] shall be sevenfold as the light of seven
[44:58] days." We've come up through seven
[45:00] church ages
[45:01] now. Now, now it's the full full
[45:03] radiance. It it's using a language that
[45:05] we can begin to understand. There's
[45:06] something being expressed. And it's not
[45:08] just the light of the moon reflecting
[45:11] the light of the sun to a lesser degree.
[45:14] Now, the Bible's actually saying the
[45:16] moon is going to be as the sun.
[45:21] Amen.
[45:22] And now it's not just the light of an
[45:24] age, but it's sevenfold.
[45:27] Why? Because it's a seven seals have
[45:29] been released from the book. Christ
[45:31] who's been bound by creeds and dogmas
[45:33] has been unloosed. So the light of the
[45:34] sun is sevenfold. Who are the seals? It
[45:37] is Christ. Who opened them? It is
[45:39] Christ. What does it reveal? It reveals
[45:41] Christ.
[45:42] So now the light of the moon, she's been
[45:44] loosed.
[45:45] She's been set free. She's no longer
[45:47] bound. She's no longer reflecting. Now
[45:49] she can shine in the radiance of her
[45:52] groom. In that day the Lord bindeth up
[45:55] the breach of his people, which is a
[45:57] capstone message, and health the stroke
[45:59] of their wound. That's defeating death.
[46:02] The wound was sin. The stroke is death.
[46:05] So this language that's being used, it's
[46:07] it's used to represent a dramatic shift
[46:10] in something. For someone to say the
[46:13] moon is out and it's shining with the
[46:16] same intensity as the sun immediately
[46:20] you should say that's never happened
[46:22] before
[46:25] right
[46:26] and you'd be like well how do you know
[46:27] it's just not the sun?
[46:30] It's a good question because it says the
[46:32] light of the moon shall be as the light
[46:34] of the sun. Isaiah is prophesying of a
[46:38] change, a new thing, a greater glory for
[46:41] the moon, an exaltation. Taking the
[46:43] moon, who at one time reflected at one
[46:45] time had a particular place, now God's
[46:46] wanting to exalt it to the highest
[46:48] place. Now God's wanting to restore it
[46:50] back to its original condition wherein
[46:52] there was a desire. Even if you look at
[46:54] the woman, she was made co-equal to
[46:57] Adam.
[46:58] She wasn't inferior. She wasn't
[46:59] superior. She was co-equal with him.
[47:02] What was it that God desired to have in
[47:04] the beginning? to have a bride of
[47:06] equality, to have a wife likened unto
[47:09] himself, not one inferior, not one
[47:11] superior, but one that would be just as
[47:13] he was. And now he says, the light of
[47:15] the moon who reflected the wife, who
[47:17] reflected the bride, she is as the son.
[47:20] She is him.
[47:23] That's right.
[47:24] It's an exaltation.
[47:26] It's a raising up. It's a climax of
[47:28] what's been raising since the birth of
[47:29] the church.
[47:31] So, with this now in in view and and I
[47:34] hope that you've been able to follow me
[47:35] through this,
[47:38] if we can look at the what Jesus says in
[47:40] Matthew 5 13-16,
[47:43] I I'd like to be able to um emphasize
[47:47] this
[47:48] through this parable or excuse me, not
[47:50] this parable through these words that
[47:52] he's expressing these principles. He
[47:55] says, "You are the salt of the earth,
[47:58] but the salt have lost its savor.
[48:00] Wherewith shall it be salted? It is then
[48:03] forth good for nothing but to be cast
[48:05] out and to be trotten under foot of
[48:07] men." So when he designates us or uses
[48:10] this characteristic as salt,
[48:13] we should understand
[48:15] primarily that we have a purpose,
[48:19] that we have a use, we have a utility.
[48:21] All of us do.
[48:23] So it doesn't mean if if you're not a
[48:26] deacon or a trustee, a song leader, a
[48:28] musician, if you don't have some kind of
[48:30] part in a local body that that you don't
[48:32] have a that you don't have a purpose.
[48:33] Now that could be further from the
[48:35] truth.
[48:36] Do you realize those who do not have a
[48:39] position realize that the positions were
[48:42] granted for you?
[48:46] Listen, the only reason I'm here is
[48:47] because of you.
[48:50] None of you are here for me. I'm here
[48:52] for you.
[48:54] There's no pretense on my part thinking,
[48:56] "Oh, isn't this wonderful? Everyone
[48:57] showed up for me and my family." No, I
[48:58] showed up in Phoenix for you. So, I
[49:01] realized that I was given an opportunity
[49:03] to preach because there's people who
[49:04] need the word and doesn't exist the
[49:06] other way around. So, not that you would
[49:08] want to get arrogant with it, but if
[49:10] there's a deacon, he exists for you. If
[49:12] there's a trustee, he exists for you. If
[49:13] there's a piano player, it's because
[49:15] there's people that need to sing.
[49:18] And so we don't it's not that we aspire
[49:20] to be in position so that we can have a
[49:22] purpose but those who are in the
[49:24] positions are for your purpose for your
[49:26] benefit
[49:28] to encourage you to inspire you because
[49:30] you have a purpose
[49:31] and church is for the has a purpose to
[49:34] encourage you to inspire you not that we
[49:36] would be able to have good church
[49:37] services so that but that you could have
[49:39] good Mondays
[49:41] to me that would be a better testimony
[49:43] better than you saying brother Aaron
[49:45] that was a great service I'd want to
[49:46] hear a text message on a Monday evening
[49:48] said, "I've had the best Monday I've had
[49:50] in years." That's a greater testimony.
[49:53] So, you have a purpose. You have a
[49:55] utility. You have a calling. And listen,
[49:57] we aren't getting out of here until you
[49:59] individually as housewives, as sons,
[50:01] daughters, students, whatever it might
[50:03] be till you find your purpose and your
[50:05] happiness in it.
[50:06] Amen.
[50:07] That's what's expressed in you are the
[50:08] salt of the earth. You have a purpose.
[50:11] And if you don't fulfill your purpose,
[50:13] then there's something that's lacking
[50:16] even to the world. So then he says, "Ye
[50:18] are the light of the world. A city that
[50:20] is set on a hill cannot be hid." So now
[50:21] he's using ways to amplify how this
[50:23] light works. He says, "You are the light
[50:25] of the world." And he says, "A city set
[50:27] on a hill, you're going to see it. You
[50:30] can't hide that." You know, there's
[50:31] there there's just not a way of of
[50:34] deadening that light. You set a city on
[50:35] a hill, you can see it for miles.
[50:38] And then he says, "Neither do men light
[50:40] a candle." Again, he's amplifying,
[50:41] expounding upon what it would mean to be
[50:43] the light of the world. There's a city
[50:46] set on a hill that cannot be hid. Then
[50:49] there's a there's an obvious recognition
[50:51] of this city. Then he says to the the
[50:54] effect of a candle, you don't put a
[50:56] candle in a house and just hide it. He
[50:59] says, "But you put it on a candlestick.
[51:01] You position it. Doesn't go under a
[51:03] bushel. It goes on a candlestick so it
[51:05] can give light to all that are in the
[51:07] house. So, as long as it's on a
[51:09] candlestick in a house, it's for those
[51:10] who are in the house.
[51:12] So, there's a light for a house, there's
[51:14] a light for a room. Then he says there's
[51:15] a city on a hill, and obviously that's
[51:17] giving more light than just the candle
[51:19] that's in the room. Then he says, "Let
[51:21] your light so shine before men." In the
[51:24] same way that a city set on a hill
[51:26] shines, in the same way that a light is
[51:28] placed upon a candlestick to give light
[51:30] to a house, let your light so shine. Let
[51:33] it just reverberate in your spirits
[51:35] today. Let it just uh uh resound and
[51:38] just wash over you. Let your light so
[51:41] shine before men. Maybe maybe uh uh uh
[51:44] the downside to uh this little light of
[51:46] mine, I'm going to let it shine as we've
[51:48] relegated to the Sunday school room.
[51:49] We've let it become the kids choir song.
[51:52] But I believe every single one of us,
[51:53] youngest to oldest, should walk out of
[51:55] here today, say, "This little light of
[51:57] mine." And so, I'm going to let it
[52:00] shine. This little light of mine, and
[52:03] just sing it. I'm going to if you have
[52:05] to do this while you're singing it and
[52:08] hide it under a bushel. No,
[52:11] don't let Satan blow it out. What?
[52:12] That's my song. That's the bride's song.
[52:15] That's husband songs, wife song, grandpa
[52:17] song, grandma song. We all can sing that
[52:19] song. This little light of mine.
[52:22] Let your light so shine before men that
[52:24] they may see your good works. It's light
[52:28] so it's good. And then they don't
[52:30] glorify you. They glorify your father
[52:33] which is in heaven.
[52:35] That's who we want the glory to go to.
[52:38] Now when Jesus expresses it this way, he
[52:41] has taken his word
[52:45] and expressed something beautiful that's
[52:47] going to unfold in the body of Christ.
[52:50] He says, "Ye are the light of the
[52:52] world." And then he gives these
[52:53] different characteristics. We could say
[52:55] that we individually have a light that
[52:56] we shine before men. But then he
[52:59] represents a candle in a house that
[53:01] would shine to a household and then a
[53:03] city that would shine to the world. So
[53:05] we can see that there's actually maybe
[53:06] three different ways that he's
[53:08] expressing this or using two different
[53:09] ways to inspire us to be the candles
[53:11] that we are.
[53:13] In Revelation 1:12, then we'll read the
[53:16] interpretation of verse 20. John says,
[53:18] "I turned to see the voice that spake
[53:20] with me and being turned I saw seven
[53:23] golden candlesticks." Now Jesus says,
[53:26] "You are the light of the world." and
[53:27] then says, "You don't take a candle."
[53:30] Man does not light a candle and put it
[53:32] under a bushel, but he puts it on a
[53:33] candlestick. God then would not light a
[53:36] candle and put it under a bushel. He
[53:38] puts it on a candlestick. So now we have
[53:41] seven golden candlesticks. And in verse
[53:43] 20, we get the interpretation of this
[53:45] symbol. And the seven candlesticks which
[53:48] thou sawest are the seven churches.
[53:52] So the light of the candle positioned in
[53:54] these seven golden candlesticks
[53:56] represents the church in each age.
[54:00] And we could show you by the unfolding
[54:04] of the church ages and the messenger and
[54:06] to where it was sent that there's an
[54:08] eastward to westward movement
[54:11] of the light. as the light shining from
[54:13] the east to the west. We see that the
[54:15] light of the church ages moved from east
[54:18] to west
[54:20] and and they're arranged as
[54:22] candlesticks. And this is God lighting a
[54:24] candle, placing a candlestick to give
[54:26] light to a house. So there was a light
[54:28] to an age and you'll find that these
[54:30] ages were characterized even by the
[54:33] region. Even if you look at at Paul and
[54:37] as these messengers unfold and we see
[54:39] Luther and Wesley, you see they're
[54:41] they're they're identified even with the
[54:42] region moving westwardly
[54:45] and and I would would like to I would
[54:47] have liked maybe to take more time on
[54:49] that, but I realize that these are
[54:51] things that you understand principles
[54:53] you understand. So now instead of laying
[54:55] the foundation and maybe even using
[54:57] visual aids to recognize those things, I
[55:00] want to recall again to you how brother
[55:02] Brandham had in the summer of 1964 and I
[55:05] always thought that would make a good
[55:06] ballad for the message the summer of 64
[55:09] because there's so many profound there's
[55:11] just a dramatic shift now when brother
[55:13] Bram comes to the summer of 64 and the
[55:15] things he's preaching and all you need
[55:16] to do is listen to feast of the trumpets
[55:18] and realize okay something's happened
[55:21] and so brother Brandham has a vision
[55:23] vision and he uses the language he says
[55:26] the bride is going to come in view and
[55:28] we call it maybe the preview of the
[55:30] bride
[55:31] and the bride comes in view but then
[55:34] brother bam uses this language he show
[55:36] me each church as they have come up out
[55:39] of the ages
[55:41] and it was announced this way when he
[55:43] tells it in another place the the
[55:44] announcement the modern church will come
[55:46] into preview he says and here come the
[55:48] Asian church up so the bride's already
[55:51] come now he says the Asian church comes
[55:52] up I've never seen such a filthy bunch.
[55:55] Here come the other churches up of the
[55:58] different nations. They looked horrible.
[56:02] So, Brother Brandham, as he's describing
[56:04] this, he has the Asian church come up.
[56:06] And why was it the first one that come
[56:08] up? Because it was the first church age.
[56:11] And then as it moved from the east, the
[56:12] first church age there in in Asia, it
[56:15] moved west. Each nation represented an
[56:18] age. And brother Brandham identified
[56:21] this because when he saw MissUSA
[56:24] and he saw her, he said it was the
[56:26] worst. It was the most filthy. And then
[56:28] he mentions it later on that summer in
[56:30] the summer of 64. He mentions I didn't
[56:32] recognize it then, but that was
[56:34] Leodysia.
[56:36] So you have the first church come up
[56:38] from Asia, which represents the
[56:39] Ephesians church age. Then you have a
[56:41] secession of churches. Then MissUSA
[56:43] comes up moving from east to west. And
[56:46] now in the west again you have loud dea
[56:49] miss USA and brother says that was the
[56:51] most filthy god awful they were naked
[56:54] dancing to the beat of rock and roll.
[56:57] So then as you have the the preview now
[57:02] of of the church ages. What is it? You
[57:05] could see in each one of those ages
[57:06] there had to have been a candlestick.
[57:09] Seven church ages. Seven candlesticks. A
[57:11] preview of the bride. In each one of
[57:13] those ages, there would have been a
[57:14] message to that age to rebuke that
[57:16] church and to set that church straight.
[57:19] But then at the end of the less church
[57:21] age, we've read already revelations
[57:23] 3:17.
[57:25] In Revelations 3:20,
[57:27] he says, "Behold, I stand at the door
[57:29] and knock.
[57:31] If any man hear my voice and open the
[57:34] door, I will come in to him and will s
[57:38] with him and he with me." Amen.
[57:40] So it's not a church thing. It's not a
[57:44] regional thing.
[57:45] It it is it is an individual thing.
[57:48] If any man hear my voice there there is
[57:52] not
[57:53] there there is not a church in the world
[57:56] today, no matter what beautiful names
[57:58] they come up with that can claim to be
[58:01] pure bride and only bride within the
[58:03] church. That's
[58:03] right.
[58:04] But you should never be able to tell by
[58:06] the way the pastor preaches.
[58:08] In other words, you really don't want
[58:09] the pastor always reminding you that
[58:10] there's three kinds of believers here
[58:12] today,
[58:12] and I'm really going to wear the
[58:14] unbeliever out today.
[58:16] And so, it's not it's not a church
[58:18] designation. You can't come up with a a
[58:21] real weighty, heavy, beautiful name of a
[58:23] church and somehow change everybody who
[58:24] attends the church and say, "Well, we're
[58:26] all bride. We're all bride. We're all
[58:27] bride." Because it's an individual
[58:29] thing.
[58:31] It it's it's such an individual thing
[58:33] that that ought to always be respected.
[58:35] That's
[58:35] right. It always it should always be
[58:37] watched out over should never be taken
[58:39] away. Don't ever let anyone take away
[58:42] from you the individual leadership of
[58:44] the Holy Spirit in your life. No matter
[58:46] how many quotes they wave in your face,
[58:48] no matter how many scriptures they want
[58:49] to use, never let the leadership of the
[58:51] Holy Spirit be taken out of your life.
[58:54] It's the most precious thing we have.
[58:56] It's what makes us Christians. They that
[58:58] are the sons of God are led by the
[59:00] spirit of God. If somebody tries to take
[59:03] that away from you, they're trying to
[59:04] turn you into bastard child.
[59:06] It's the worst thing that could be taken
[59:08] away from you.
[59:09] Never be deprived of the individual
[59:11] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[59:13] But now he stands and if any man hear my
[59:16] voice, it's not let him hear what he
[59:18] saith unto the churches. If any man hear
[59:21] my voice and open the door, you got to
[59:23] hear the voice, not just the knocking.
[59:25] That's right.
[59:27] I will come into him and s with him and
[59:28] he with me. At that day you shall know
[59:30] that I and you and you and me.
[59:33] Amen.
[59:33] At that day when the revelation is made
[59:35] known.
[59:35] That's right.
[59:36] Now the reason why this scripture I take
[59:40] that back. I won't say the reason why.
[59:41] I'm not going to pretend to know all the
[59:42] reasons why the scriptures are where
[59:43] they are. But the scripture is
[59:45] describing the condition of Leodysia. It
[59:47] becomes like the final pronouncement and
[59:49] judgment on Leodysia. If it wasn't
[59:52] already apparent to us that something
[59:53] was really wrong with Leodysia when the
[59:55] spirit didn't give any compliments to
[59:57] it,
[59:59] Right.
[1:00:00] Because every other age's got a
[1:00:02] compliment.
[1:00:03] He gets to lay out the sin and God's
[1:00:05] like,
[1:00:07] "You're just going to get rebuked."
[1:00:10] That's right.
[1:00:11] It's almost as if he hid the mystery of
[1:00:13] the compliment.
[1:00:15] He hid the most beautiful thing.
[1:00:17] I'll just reveal to her my thoughts.
[1:00:20] I can't write it now because it's in the
[1:00:22] back part of my mind. My favor to her,
[1:00:25] my compliments to her will be given
[1:00:27] personally to her.
[1:00:30] Now notice how brother Brandon begins to
[1:00:32] describe
[1:00:33] this leodian church age. He says the
[1:00:35] seventh church age all smothered out
[1:00:38] with Christ on the outside.
[1:00:41] That's in the message shalom January
[1:00:42] 12th in the winter of 64. Then brother
[1:00:46] Bam says two weeks later and turn on the
[1:00:48] light January 25th he goes remember
[1:00:51] that's Jack's birthday he says remember
[1:00:54] this is the seventh church age the
[1:00:56] leodyian church age according to
[1:00:58] revelations 3 they reject Christ
[1:01:02] said he's a fugitive in his own church
[1:01:05] get get the image now Christ is no
[1:01:07] longer in the church
[1:01:10] the church that we've read about
[1:01:11] Revelations chapter 2 Revelations
[1:01:13] chapter 3 you get to chapter verse 20
[1:01:15] And now Christ is no longer in the midst
[1:01:17] of the church. He's on the outside of
[1:01:19] the church. That this is so profound.
[1:01:22] This is so staggering. This is such a
[1:01:24] tremendous revelation that brother says,
[1:01:26] "You won't find him in there anymore."
[1:01:30] They reject Christ. Of every church age
[1:01:32] that was mentioned in the Bible, the
[1:01:33] Leodysian age was the worst of them all.
[1:01:35] He calls it the most ridiculous church
[1:01:37] age. It turned him out, rejected him,
[1:01:41] put him on the outside.
[1:01:44] And then he says, "Did you see the moon
[1:01:45] blacked out the other night
[1:01:48] before the pope went to Rome?" from Rome
[1:01:51] to Jerusalem rather. He says,
[1:01:52] "Jerusalem, the oldest church. The moon
[1:01:55] is a type of the church always
[1:01:58] reflecting the light of the sun in the
[1:02:00] absence of the sun and it blacked out."
[1:02:04] Now, I'm going to continue reading some
[1:02:07] statements here. This is going back to
[1:02:08] Shalom, January 12th. We're taught in
[1:02:11] the New Testament, he says, 'D don't
[1:02:13] fail to get this. And this is where you
[1:02:14] see brother Brandham's wanting to show
[1:02:16] this other type of the moon in the New
[1:02:19] Testament that we're not of this city
[1:02:20] Jerusalem on earth, but we are from New
[1:02:23] Jerusalem above.
[1:02:25] So this must be the moon Jerusalem,
[1:02:30] not the new Jerusalem above.
[1:02:32] So this moon, now we catch this, this
[1:02:35] moon. So the moon represents the church
[1:02:38] earthly. And isn't it strange that just
[1:02:41] before the pope took his journey to
[1:02:42] Jerusalem that the moon in the heavens
[1:02:44] was made a total blackout just a few
[1:02:48] days before he took his journey. Then he
[1:02:50] says, "What does it show?" And he's
[1:02:51] talking about how it's fellow how
[1:02:53] they're coming together. This economical
[1:02:54] economical movement. He says, "And what
[1:02:56] does that reflect? Fellowship. They're
[1:02:58] wanting Protestant and Cathol
[1:03:00] Catholicism joining together." When
[1:03:03] they're doing that and what will
[1:03:05] completely do, God. Notice who did it.
[1:03:08] God reflected this to us in the moon of
[1:03:11] a total blackout.
[1:03:14] So now catch he's saying it's a total
[1:03:15] blackout of the church. Did any of you
[1:03:18] see the paper where they took the
[1:03:19] pictures of the moon? I have it here.
[1:03:22] And so this is where it's it's from the
[1:03:26] Tucson Daily Citizen. And I believe this
[1:03:28] is the very paper that Brother Bram's
[1:03:29] referring to. He said, "Did you see the
[1:03:32] paper took the pictures of the moon?" I
[1:03:33] have it here. If it ain't a perfect
[1:03:36] image, leaving out the seventh age, now
[1:03:39] follow this because I want to read a
[1:03:40] couple more statements. He says,
[1:03:41] "Leaving out the seventh age, which is
[1:03:43] not yet exactly the way I draw by the
[1:03:46] Holy Spirit, the church ages." So when
[1:03:49] brother Brandham drew it out himself,
[1:03:51] there was a a seventh phase with a
[1:03:54] little sliver of light. Correct?
[1:03:57] Then he said the Holy Spirit drew it out
[1:03:58] supernaturally on the wall at the back
[1:04:00] of the tabernacle. Now he's saying God
[1:04:02] has put it in the heavens. He said, 'But
[1:04:04] there's only six frames that were
[1:04:05] published. But then he go he makes this
[1:04:08] statement. He goes to these links to
[1:04:09] emphasize this. The moon represents the
[1:04:12] church.
[1:04:14] Then he amplifies. I'll skip a little
[1:04:16] bit. The shadow of the world crosses the
[1:04:18] moon. So now he's telling us what this
[1:04:19] eclipse means. The shadow of worldlyism,
[1:04:23] the shadow of worldliness, worldly
[1:04:25] church has swept across to black out the
[1:04:28] entire light of the Bible. The world got
[1:04:31] in the light of the reflection. The
[1:04:33] world crossed in the light of the moon
[1:04:35] and blinded out the sun and the
[1:04:38] reflection of the moon that's supposed
[1:04:39] to be living light to the giving light
[1:04:41] to the earth it was blacked out.
[1:04:45] The very next week he says this in the
[1:04:47] message shalom January 19th he says this
[1:04:50] about what was represented in the
[1:04:51] heavens that he himself
[1:04:54] he came down himself and made his
[1:04:56] vindication of it as the moon and the
[1:04:58] light going out going out and to this
[1:05:01] ledian age going into total darkness
[1:05:04] again. And here he comes down and
[1:05:07] vindicates it on the moon just at the
[1:05:10] time that all the churches are going
[1:05:11] together in a consolidation of the
[1:05:13] Federation of Churches.
[1:05:16] Now I I'll skip some and listen to how
[1:05:18] he starts using the language like this.
[1:05:20] God is a jealous God. He's jealous and
[1:05:24] he wants his wife pure. Now while he's
[1:05:27] talking about a blackout of the moon
[1:05:28] which should have been a wife, he starts
[1:05:31] talking about God's wife. He wants her a
[1:05:33] virgin chasteed. nothing in the world
[1:05:35] into her at all. Altogether his word,
[1:05:39] part of him. We must be a part of the
[1:05:41] word, not a part of the creed, a part of
[1:05:43] the word. Not part of the church, a part
[1:05:46] of the bride.
[1:05:47] So he says the church is condemned. We
[1:05:50] know that she goes to outer darkness,
[1:05:53] but the bride goes up.
[1:05:57] So while the moon's being blacked out,
[1:05:59] the bride's got to be going up.
[1:06:02] So that was paragraph 41. Paragraph 46.
[1:06:04] Blackness blacked out. The world got in
[1:06:07] line with the reflection of the sun to
[1:06:09] the moon and it blacked out. It blacked
[1:06:10] out what? The church, not the wife.
[1:06:14] Amen.
[1:06:16] That's exactly what happened in the
[1:06:17] natural in the spiritual. It happened in
[1:06:19] the natural foreshadowed and told us
[1:06:21] that exactly what's taking place. Now,
[1:06:22] you see how that comes out at the end.
[1:06:25] He says, "Many of you young people, you
[1:06:27] won't have to get too old until you'll
[1:06:28] see it anyhow. If you live three or four
[1:06:30] more years, the moon now we're in the
[1:06:33] Leodysian church age. In the Leodysian
[1:06:36] church age of all other churches, the
[1:06:37] Leodysia last lukewarm church age,
[1:06:40] Christ was on the outside of the church.
[1:06:42] Any Bible reader knows that. Revelations
[1:06:44] 3, he's on the outside of the church
[1:06:46] trying to get his way back in again and
[1:06:49] never did say he got in.
[1:06:51] That's right.
[1:06:52] So, we don't have this hope that he
[1:06:53] somehow gets back in. He's left that.
[1:06:56] That's right.
[1:06:58] So, Brother Bram's bringing us to a
[1:07:00] distinct the the Well, boy, this is a
[1:07:03] mouthful. So, the restoration isn't
[1:07:06] trying to get Christ back in the church.
[1:07:08] That's right.
[1:07:09] But a bride out of it.
[1:07:10] Amen.
[1:07:11] Not trying to get us to go back in and
[1:07:12] worship under something under the ages,
[1:07:14] worship a truth from another age,
[1:07:16] because he's not trying to get us back
[1:07:17] into that mode or that same, but he's
[1:07:19] trying to bring us out further.
[1:07:21] Amen.
[1:07:21] He says he was on the outside and he
[1:07:23] never did say he got in, but as many as
[1:07:24] I he loved, he rebuked and chasened. The
[1:07:26] message would rebuke and chasen those he
[1:07:28] loved. Now was knocking trying to get
[1:07:31] in. Darkness shut it off. Exactly what's
[1:07:33] come to pass. The light that has been
[1:07:36] shining soon will absolutely be shut
[1:07:39] completely out.
[1:07:42] That's January 19th, 1964.
[1:07:45] And remember that that beautiful ballad,
[1:07:47] the summer of 64. Catch how this goes
[1:07:50] forward now. Because brother Bram's
[1:07:52] looking at this. He's just preached at
[1:07:54] the end of 63. We now know what the
[1:07:56] third pull is and what it does. It's
[1:07:58] fully identified, fully vindicated. From
[1:08:00] then on, look away to Jesus. He tells to
[1:08:04] look away from every thing else. Look to
[1:08:06] Jesus.
[1:08:07] Now, keep your eyes on him.
[1:08:08] It's the third pull.
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:10] Thoroughly identified, thoroughly
[1:08:12] vindicated. He says, "I'm sure you know
[1:08:13] what it is." And everybody's like,
[1:08:14] "Yeah, sure, brother Brandham.
[1:08:15] Yeah, we we know exactly what it is."
[1:08:19] But then now we realize Brother
[1:08:21] Brandham's recognizing there's a man
[1:08:22] here who can turn on the light.
[1:08:24] Yes.
[1:08:26] And so, Brother Brandham is is seeing
[1:08:28] the the setting of the sun in one sense,
[1:08:31] but it is the rising of the sun in
[1:08:33] another.
[1:08:34] So, he's using this language of the
[1:08:37] seventh church age, it's if that ain't a
[1:08:39] perfect image of those of those what was
[1:08:41] in the newspaper. He's saying if that
[1:08:43] ain't a perfect image, these these six
[1:08:45] panels, he goes leaving out the seventh
[1:08:48] church age because in his mind he
[1:08:50] thought there'd be a seventh panel
[1:08:53] that they left out because the seventh
[1:08:55] church age isn't over yet. So he says
[1:08:58] the light that's been shining will soon
[1:08:59] absolutely be shut out completely. Now
[1:09:01] watch the transition unfold in
[1:09:04] recognizing your day and its message.
[1:09:08] July 26, 1964, he says, "I don't know. I
[1:09:12] didn't know there'd be a mysterious
[1:09:13] blackout in the moon to represent this
[1:09:16] Leodysian church age. So now he's
[1:09:19] realizing there's not a seventh panel.
[1:09:23] The seventh panel was the total eclipse.
[1:09:26] So the reason why there was only six
[1:09:28] phases is the seventh would have looked
[1:09:30] just like this.
[1:09:33] And he's identifying this now. He says,
[1:09:35] "I didn't know there was going to be a
[1:09:36] mysterious blackout on the moon to
[1:09:37] represent this leotardian age." Now on
[1:09:39] the papers you only get six pages. It's
[1:09:42] because the Lord is in church age was
[1:09:45] blacked out completely. So now he's
[1:09:47] saying it's been shut out completely.
[1:09:50] That's why he goes to shreport he's
[1:09:52] saying flee for your lives. Run for your
[1:09:53] lives.
[1:09:55] The very live tabernacle. That's why his
[1:09:57] message anymore is you can't remain as
[1:09:59] you are. You can't stay in Pentecost.
[1:10:02] This has gone further up the road. My
[1:10:04] message isn't to restore us back to
[1:10:06] these things that are Pentecostal. is to
[1:10:08] take these things into the promised
[1:10:10] land.
[1:10:13] He says because the Leodysian church was
[1:10:14] blacked out completely. And if you
[1:10:16] notice the spiritual application as God
[1:10:19] said it in the heaven when I said it
[1:10:22] here on earth I left a little bitty
[1:10:24] space
[1:10:25] just a tiny little bit of light. That
[1:10:27] was just before the very elected was to
[1:10:29] be called from the earth. This is
[1:10:30] brother Brandham's thought process.
[1:10:33] And if if you feel there's any weakness
[1:10:35] in identifying this as brother as
[1:10:37] brother Brandham's thought process, I'd
[1:10:39] refer to you to Jesus in the garden
[1:10:41] offering his thought process. Let this
[1:10:44] cup pass.
[1:10:45] Nevertheless, let thy will be done.
[1:10:48] And so now, brother Brandham is just
[1:10:50] being vulnerable saying, you know, I
[1:10:51] wrote it because I was thinking that
[1:10:53] there would be a representation of light
[1:10:55] before the elect are called from the
[1:10:56] earth. The reason I placed it on there
[1:10:58] for the seventh age, I put it there to
[1:11:00] represent the elect at the end of the
[1:11:03] age. But when God put it in the heavens,
[1:11:06] it was totally blacked out.
[1:11:08] And then he now still holding to what he
[1:11:10] thought, he said it means maybe the last
[1:11:13] one is called from that leosene age. We
[1:11:15] don't know. There could be a sermon on
[1:11:17] it.
[1:11:19] And he preaches it.
[1:11:22] You mean there could be a sermon on
[1:11:23] Burban? Just preaches it. That's what
[1:11:25] the message is. You can say there could
[1:11:27] be a message on it. And brother Ben,
[1:11:29] even in recognizing your day and its
[1:11:30] message is bringing us to this very
[1:11:32] thought that what I thought would be a
[1:11:34] sliver of light in Leodysia, it doesn't
[1:11:37] exist within Leodysia. But she's
[1:11:40] raptured spiritually resurrected
[1:11:43] out of dark denominationalism.
[1:11:46] What a resurrection that was. What a
[1:11:49] resurrection this is. When you heard
[1:11:51] from your theophony, when you heard the
[1:11:54] eagle scream, he called you out of the
[1:11:56] barnyard.
[1:11:58] Listen, the barnyard still exists cuz we
[1:12:00] can still hear the chickens, but there's
[1:12:02] more eagles to get out of there.
[1:12:06] We want them to be quickened from the
[1:12:07] barnyard.
[1:12:09] He put in the heavens. It was totally
[1:12:11] blacked out. He says, "Maybe the last
[1:12:13] one is called from that Leodysian age."
[1:12:15] He said, "There could be a sermon on
[1:12:16] it."
[1:12:18] But how are you called then?
[1:12:21] You are you staying with me?
[1:12:24] Oh my goodness gracious.
[1:12:27] Well, maybe it just be me and you. I'll
[1:12:29] just turn this thing around and we'll
[1:12:30] preach to brother John. Remember
[1:12:32] Revelations 3:20. Christ is no longer in
[1:12:35] the church. That's why the church is
[1:12:38] blacked out.
[1:12:40] That's why there's total darkness. It
[1:12:42] had to be.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:43] Otherwise, we couldn't have Revelations
[1:12:44] 3:20.
[1:12:46] So then with this church in this
[1:12:48] condition, notice how beautifully this
[1:12:50] unfolds
[1:12:52] because brother Brandham identified
[1:12:53] himself as the voice of Revelations
[1:12:55] 18:4. I heard another voice from heaven
[1:12:59] after it describes and I've run out of
[1:13:00] time so I can't read the first three
[1:13:01] verses. Mystery Babylon. She's become
[1:13:04] the cage of everything filthy and foul
[1:13:06] and vulgar. So then there's another
[1:13:08] voice from heaven saying, "Come out of
[1:13:10] her, my people."
[1:13:12] What? Come out of the church systems.
[1:13:14] Come out of Leosa. come out of her
[1:13:16] mystery Babylon, my people, that you be
[1:13:18] not partakers of her sins, and that you
[1:13:20] receive not of her plagues,
[1:13:22] that you receive not of her, that you
[1:13:24] partake not of her ignorance,
[1:13:26] cuz ignorance is no more an excuse
[1:13:28] because the full word has been opened
[1:13:29] up. Now, the spirit of truth directs us
[1:13:31] to the word. Don't stay in ignorance.
[1:13:33] Don't stay in a glare. Don't stay in
[1:13:34] what glitters, but come into the gospel.
[1:13:37] Come out of her, my people, that you not
[1:13:39] be a partaker of unbelief, because if
[1:13:41] you do, you'll receive of her plagues.
[1:13:44] So there's a voice that calls the bride
[1:13:46] out of the fallen cursed Leodysia. This
[1:13:48] is separating light from darkness.
[1:13:52] Once again, there's a voice that says,
[1:13:54] "Let there be light and there was
[1:13:56] light." And God separates the light from
[1:13:58] the darkness. We read it last time. God
[1:14:01] is doing it the same as he did in the
[1:14:03] beginning. God separating light from
[1:14:05] darkness. It's Revelations 18:4.
[1:14:10] Come out of her, my people.
[1:14:12] Amen.
[1:14:13] So if you don't have a revelation of
[1:14:15] what brother Brandham meant when he said
[1:14:16] the church goes up in Revelations 4 and
[1:14:17] you don't see again to Revelations 19.
[1:14:19] If you don't have a revelation of it,
[1:14:20] then you can never hear the voice of
[1:14:21] Revelations 18:4.
[1:14:24] Because if you go in Revelations 4 and
[1:14:26] don't come back to 19, you never hear
[1:14:28] the voice of 18.
[1:14:30] And that's the reason why some
[1:14:33] are still right where they are.
[1:14:34] That's right.
[1:14:35] They've never heard the voice of
[1:14:36] Revelation 18:4.
[1:14:37] They're still doing it by church system.
[1:14:40] They're doing it by legislation. They're
[1:14:41] doing it by car charisma,
[1:14:44] sensation.
[1:14:45] All they need to do is hear the voice.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:48] And they will.
[1:14:49] Amen.
[1:14:50] So then notice this then. If we look at
[1:14:52] Revelations chapter 3, I love I love how
[1:14:56] the bride can sit hour after hour
[1:15:00] drinking in these things. I meant to
[1:15:02] tell you at the beginning, I'm just
[1:15:04] fishing this morning.
[1:15:06] Brother Bram said, "Time's not allotted
[1:15:08] to a man while he's fishing."
[1:15:12] And I know somebody's getting nervous. I
[1:15:13] don't mean to make you nervous. I'm I'll
[1:15:14] run out of notes here in a minute.
[1:15:19] We have Christ standing at the door
[1:15:21] knocking. If any man hear my voice and
[1:15:24] open the door,
[1:15:26] read Revelations 4:1.
[1:15:29] After this, I looked and behold, a door
[1:15:33] was opened in heaven. Yeah.
[1:15:37] So, we can't lose sight of the door
[1:15:39] that's being introduced in Revelations
[1:15:41] 3:20.
[1:15:43] Why? Because now an entrance has been
[1:15:45] ministered unto us. Not a door back into
[1:15:48] Leodysia.
[1:15:49] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:15:52] It's a door. Then the very next door
[1:15:54] that opens is a door in heaven. So John
[1:15:58] as a type of the believer, he doesn't
[1:16:00] remain in Leodysia.
[1:16:02] He has to go through this open door of
[1:16:04] Revelations 3:20. And he comes to this
[1:16:07] door that's opened in heaven. And the
[1:16:09] first voice which I heard were was as it
[1:16:11] were a trumpet talking with me, which
[1:16:13] said, "Come up hither."
[1:16:15] Amen.
[1:16:16] And I'll show thee things which must be
[1:16:19] hereafter.
[1:16:20] What is hereafter? That's the church
[1:16:22] ages in Revelations 2 and three. What's
[1:16:25] here? Oh, hallelujah. Revelations
[1:16:28] chapter 5. the ram coming to take the
[1:16:31] book.
[1:16:33] And the only way you can see that is to
[1:16:35] come up higher.
[1:16:37] If you're still in Revelations 3:19, you
[1:16:39] can't see it.
[1:16:41] But a door is opened in heaven and the
[1:16:43] voice says, "Come up higher
[1:16:45] and I'll show you the things which must
[1:16:46] be hereafter, the opening of the seven
[1:16:49] seals."
[1:16:52] And so the invitation of Revelations
[1:16:53] 18:4
[1:16:55] and Revelations 4:1, it's what brings
[1:16:58] the bride to Revelations 19:7.
[1:17:01] So come out of her, my people, calling
[1:17:03] you out of Babylon.
[1:17:05] Answers to Revelations 3:20. If any man
[1:17:07] hear my voice, then a door is opened up
[1:17:11] into heaven. And then that separates the
[1:17:14] bride
[1:17:16] from Leodysia.
[1:17:18] separates the seed from the shuck.
[1:17:21] And that brings union time.
[1:17:24] That brings marriage time. Revelations
[1:17:26] 19:7, "Let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:17:28] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:17:30] the lamb is come and his wife."
[1:17:33] Now there's another moon and his wife
[1:17:37] hath made herself ready. The sun and
[1:17:40] moon again, a new heavens. And what is
[1:17:42] it? It's in the midst of the darkness,
[1:17:44] in the midst of the confusion, in the
[1:17:46] midst of mystery Babylon, going into
[1:17:47] chaos. Come out of her, my people. Come
[1:17:50] up a little bit higher. And we enter
[1:17:52] into this union, into this presence. An
[1:17:55] entrance has been ministered unto us
[1:17:58] into a union with him. The marriage of
[1:18:00] the lamb has come.
[1:18:03] I'm not getting newagy. I didn't spend
[1:18:04] the weekend in Sedona, but there's a new
[1:18:06] moon.
[1:18:08] No longer just a dim reflection, but
[1:18:10] she's come to the same light as the son.
[1:18:14] Yes.
[1:18:16] Because his wife hath made herself
[1:18:18] ready.
[1:18:19] So then in the very next chapter,
[1:18:20] Revelations 21:2, in the very next
[1:18:24] chapter,
[1:18:26] I John saw
[1:18:29] the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming
[1:18:32] down from God out of heaven. And the
[1:18:34] revelation he immediately gets prepared
[1:18:36] as a bride adorned for her husband.
[1:18:39] Why?
[1:18:39] Brother Brandham said, "We're not from
[1:18:41] the Jerusalem of the earth. We're from
[1:18:43] the new Jerusalem above." So the moon
[1:18:45] that's blacked out is the earthly
[1:18:46] Jerusalem.
[1:18:48] But there must be a new Jerusalem.
[1:18:51] And there's got to be a representation.
[1:18:53] She has to be raised up. When the door
[1:18:56] is shut, I led to see her. When she's
[1:18:58] completely blacked out, when she's
[1:19:00] completely dark, there must be a rising.
[1:19:04] There must be a light that comes at the
[1:19:06] end. I, John, saw the new Jerusalem
[1:19:09] coming down from God out of heaven,
[1:19:10] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:19:12] husband.
[1:19:13] Then in verse 9, and there came unto one
[1:19:15] of me one of the seven angels, which had
[1:19:16] the seven vials full of the seven last
[1:19:18] plagues, and talking with me, saying,
[1:19:20] Come here, I'll show you the bride, the
[1:19:23] lamb's wife.
[1:19:26] the the wife of the son.
[1:19:28] Let me show her to you.
[1:19:30] So when he sees the city, he's struck
[1:19:32] with the revelation of a wife.
[1:19:35] Now he's being told he's going to see
[1:19:36] the wife. And he carried me away in the
[1:19:39] spirit to a great and high mountain and
[1:19:40] showed me that great city,
[1:19:44] the holy Jerusalem
[1:19:46] descending out of heaven from God,
[1:19:48] having the glory of God. The splendor,
[1:19:53] the brightness, the radiance, and her
[1:19:57] light was like a stone most precious,
[1:20:00] even like a jasper stone, clear as
[1:20:03] crystal. No shadow of turning, no
[1:20:06] darkness, no dimness. Her light was as
[1:20:09] the light of the sun
[1:20:10] glory.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah. It's the bride, the glory of
[1:20:14] the son of man.
[1:20:17] Expressing his character, expressing his
[1:20:19] life.
[1:20:21] John sees a holy city, a new Jerusalem.
[1:20:23] He thinks of the bride. He's going to be
[1:20:24] shown the bride. He sees the city. Why?
[1:20:27] Because the bride is the mystery
[1:20:29] revealed of the new Jerusalem. That's
[1:20:30] right.
[1:20:31] Brother Bam taught us when a man chooses
[1:20:33] a wife,
[1:20:34] he's telling you what his future home's
[1:20:36] going to be like.
[1:20:36] Exactly.
[1:20:37] So, we know what the future home's going
[1:20:39] to be like. And you know, you're a
[1:20:40] bride.
[1:20:41] You're his bride, right?
[1:20:43] The devil's trying to keep you from just
[1:20:45] accepting it. We know the new
[1:20:46] Jerusalem's perfect. We know it shines
[1:20:49] perfectly. We know it's made perfectly.
[1:20:51] We know there's no death. There's no
[1:20:53] sin. There's no weakness. There's no
[1:20:54] fault. That's what the new Jerusalem is.
[1:20:57] And we know that he chose you.
[1:20:59] Amen.
[1:21:00] And we know that you're his wife.
[1:21:02] So we've already seen the future home.
[1:21:05] So then we know we must reveal that.
[1:21:09] Why? Because in use the mystery of the
[1:21:11] future home. You are the first
[1:21:13] expression of the new Jerusalem. You're
[1:21:15] the first expression of its glory.
[1:21:17] You're the first expression of its
[1:21:18] holiness.
[1:21:21] We can accept that.
[1:21:25] So then, all right, fine. I'll accept
[1:21:28] it. But I'm longwinded.
[1:21:30] So then Matthew 5:14.
[1:21:34] Listen to this. We recognize in Matthew
[1:21:37] chapter 5
[1:21:39] that the candle he when he refers to you
[1:21:41] are the light of the world that he
[1:21:44] placed seven candlesticks
[1:21:47] in seven church ages that lit up the
[1:21:50] house for each age. And those in that
[1:21:52] age as the light moved from the east to
[1:21:55] the west. You see where that light
[1:21:58] impacted them in those in those regions
[1:22:00] even to the point where God
[1:22:02] characterizes those age by the national
[1:22:04] garb of the people as the preview of the
[1:22:08] the the worldly the church ages went
[1:22:10] forward. But he said ye are the light of
[1:22:14] the world.
[1:22:16] A city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1:22:19] hidden.
[1:22:21] Hallelujah. We've had seven candles
[1:22:24] placed giving light through seven church
[1:22:27] ages. But my bride will not just be a
[1:22:30] candle in a house. She's going to be a
[1:22:34] city set on a hill. So in the last days,
[1:22:38] I will not just have a bride in Asia and
[1:22:41] just have a bride later in Europe, but I
[1:22:43] will have a bride from around the world
[1:22:48] with a voice that goes from the circuits
[1:22:50] of the entire heavens. a city set on a
[1:22:52] hill that lights up the world.
[1:22:55] So in the preview of the bride,
[1:22:58] brother Bam saw the bride. Then he saw a
[1:23:01] procession of churches representing the
[1:23:04] church ages. And he says they went off
[1:23:06] to the left.
[1:23:09] They went left because they weren't
[1:23:10] right.
[1:23:12] I think that's what brother George
[1:23:13] Martin from South Africa says. I found
[1:23:15] the way to heaven. First turn right,
[1:23:17] then stay straight and you won't be
[1:23:19] left.
[1:23:23] He says they went off to the left and
[1:23:25] disappeared in chaos. Can we see the
[1:23:27] chaos?
[1:23:29] But the bride came back.
[1:23:31] I'm just taking different statements now
[1:23:33] because she was she was alpha and omega.
[1:23:38] Okay, now he's using language that
[1:23:40] pertains to Christ.
[1:23:42] She is
[1:23:43] alpha. That's with the capital A. And
[1:23:46] omega.
[1:23:47] Amen. And he says instead of going down,
[1:23:50] they started going up.
[1:23:52] Wow. Revelations 3, the church ends in
[1:23:55] total blackout, but there's a knock on a
[1:23:58] door. And there's a revelations 4:1.
[1:24:01] Come up higher. As Leodysia goes into
[1:24:03] chaos, they says they started leaving.
[1:24:08] Hallelujah. We've already started
[1:24:10] leaving.
[1:24:12] Well, I'm believing, right?
[1:24:15] And if I'm believing, I'm going to be
[1:24:16] leaving.
[1:24:19] Abraham says in choosing of a bride, he
[1:24:20] picks this back up, coming up on the one
[1:24:22] side come the same bride that went
[1:24:24] around this way. Here come them little
[1:24:26] ladies again. Now notice how he begins
[1:24:28] to describe them. Each one of them was
[1:24:30] dressed in their national garb from
[1:24:31] where they came from.
[1:24:34] Now before he saw them individually, now
[1:24:37] he sees them as one group dressed in
[1:24:39] their national garb. He says like
[1:24:40] Switzerland, Germany, so forth. each one
[1:24:42] wearing that kind of garb all along hair
[1:24:45] just exactly like the one at the first.
[1:24:47] And here they come walking onward
[1:24:49] Christian soldiers marching as to war.
[1:24:51] And when they passed by the preview
[1:24:53] stand where we were standing just all at
[1:24:55] once, every eye went that way. And when
[1:24:57] they turned back and on they went
[1:24:59] marching and just as they started to
[1:25:02] going right up into the skies.
[1:25:05] This other one went right up to the
[1:25:07] brink of a hill and went down like that.
[1:25:11] Just think about that.
[1:25:14] Leodysa descending into chaos and
[1:25:16] darkness. The bride is ascending.
[1:25:19] These started marching right up into the
[1:25:22] sky.
[1:25:23] This is a masterpiece. The first time he
[1:25:25] tells it, that represented the bride
[1:25:26] coming out of all nations. A city set on
[1:25:30] a hill. That's how you're the light of
[1:25:32] the world. Not just the light to an age,
[1:25:34] light to a house. You are the light of
[1:25:35] the world. A city that is set on a hill
[1:25:37] cannot be hid. That bride represented
[1:25:39] coming out of all nations. She each one
[1:25:41] represented a nation as they march
[1:25:43] perfectly in line with the word. And I
[1:25:46] have to watch her. She'll get out of
[1:25:47] step with that word if I don't watch.
[1:25:49] When she's passing by, if she gets by,
[1:25:51] maybe it'll be in my time when I'm over,
[1:25:53] when I'm finished or whatever it is,
[1:25:55] they was getting back, trying their best
[1:25:57] and getting back. Just get in line
[1:25:59] because they was looking out somewhere
[1:26:01] else, watching about that church that
[1:26:04] just went into chaos.
[1:26:07] That's the reason why we get out of step
[1:26:09] is we've got our eyes on the chaotic
[1:26:11] church. We got our eyes on the chaotic
[1:26:13] age. Listen, lose all ties to
[1:26:15] Leodysia.
[1:26:20] Don't look at the church. That's how
[1:26:22] they got out of step. He says in feast
[1:26:23] of trumpets two weeks later and that
[1:26:25] little bride of every nation, each one
[1:26:27] of them dressed like their nation they
[1:26:28] come from just perfectly walking before
[1:26:31] the Lord. Why? You are the light of the
[1:26:33] world. You are the new Jerusalem, a city
[1:26:36] set on a hill that cannot be hid. You
[1:26:38] are raised up for this purpose. These
[1:26:40] started marching right up into the sky.
[1:26:42] And they met marching. I noticed a
[1:26:44] couple little girls in the back. Looked
[1:26:45] like they might get some kind of foreign
[1:26:47] girl like Sweden or Switzerland. And
[1:26:49] it's one place he says or Germany or
[1:26:51] somewhere. He never said America.
[1:26:55] It looked American though probably.
[1:26:57] Sweden or Switzerland or somewhere. They
[1:26:59] started to look around. I said, "Don't
[1:27:00] do that. Don't get out of that step.
[1:27:03] Don't look at what's going down.
[1:27:06] Don't look at the chaos. Don't look at
[1:27:07] the darkness.
[1:27:09] If I need to apologize for spending the
[1:27:11] first 30 minutes on the darkness, I
[1:27:12] will. Don't look at that.
[1:27:14] It's only to bring the contrast.
[1:27:17] Brother Abraham says there's a man here
[1:27:18] who could turn a light and he separated
[1:27:20] the light from the darkness and the
[1:27:22] light he called day and the darkness he
[1:27:24] called night. And God's word always
[1:27:26] separates light from darkness. It's the
[1:27:28] word that does the separating light from
[1:27:30] darkness. God ever does the same thing.
[1:27:33] When he gets ready to use anything like
[1:27:35] he got ready to use this world, he had
[1:27:38] to separate the light from the darkness.
[1:27:40] When he gets ready to use a group of
[1:27:41] people, he has to separate the light
[1:27:43] from the darkness. When he gets ready to
[1:27:46] use an individual, he separates the
[1:27:48] light from the darkness.
[1:27:50] Oh God, use me.
[1:27:54] Use me, Lord.
[1:27:55] Let this word once again separate light
[1:27:58] from darkness.
[1:27:59] Amen. I'm not worried about what I can
[1:28:02] call darkness out there, Lord. Any
[1:28:04] darkness in me, separate me from it.
[1:28:08] Light comes by God. The light comes by
[1:28:12] his spoken word. The word of God said,
[1:28:14] "Let there be light." When there was no
[1:28:17] light, he sent the light to separate the
[1:28:19] darkness from the night light.
[1:28:22] This word of command cleared the sky so
[1:28:24] the sun could shine in.
[1:28:26] And his word today is what clears back
[1:28:30] all the atmospheres of unbelief.
[1:28:34] I challenge you if you have a need today
[1:28:36] to just claim it.
[1:28:37] As this word is driven back complex,
[1:28:40] driven back fears, driven back memory,
[1:28:43] imagination, conscience, and reason. As
[1:28:45] it's driving it back, and you feel the
[1:28:47] rays of his sunlight bathe in your soul,
[1:28:49] just accept him now. Receive him in the
[1:28:52] light of his presence. Because the word
[1:28:54] of command cleared the sky so the sun
[1:28:56] could shine in the beginning. Right now,
[1:28:58] let it word. Let the word go forth as
[1:29:00] thus sayeth the Lord. Clouds, you roll
[1:29:02] back. Son, you shine.
[1:29:05] It's all right under this word that's
[1:29:06] been opened to us in this house. This is
[1:29:08] what the third pull is. The opening of
[1:29:10] the word.
[1:29:12] It's not a moment in time where you'll
[1:29:14] stand before a withered plant and speak
[1:29:16] to it. The third pull is the opening of
[1:29:19] the word.
[1:29:20] The third pull is Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:24] It's a union and a position with him
[1:29:26] where we recognize I am a daughter of
[1:29:28] God. I am a son of God. I've been raised
[1:29:30] up for this.
[1:29:32] I've been hung in the heavens as a
[1:29:33] testimony that I will rule over
[1:29:35] darkness.
[1:29:37] Let the word shine and cast away. Clear
[1:29:40] back all the atmospheres of unbelief.
[1:29:43] The Bible says in Isaiah 60:es 1-3,
[1:29:45] "Arise, shine, for thy light has come
[1:29:49] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:29:52] thee.
[1:29:53] This is where verse two that we read in
[1:29:55] the beginning comes. For behold, the
[1:29:57] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[1:29:59] darkness the people.
[1:30:01] That that's we see that plainly. This
[1:30:05] day this scriptur is fulfilled in our
[1:30:07] eyes.
[1:30:08] Amen.
[1:30:08] But what about arise shine for thy light
[1:30:10] is come
[1:30:11] right
[1:30:11] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:30:14] thee. says, "Gross darkness is on the
[1:30:17] people, but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:30:21] thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
[1:30:26] thee,
[1:30:27] and the Gentiles shall come to thy
[1:30:30] light, and the kings to the brightness
[1:30:33] of thy rising." It is the rising of the
[1:30:38] sun.
[1:30:40] In what? In the bride coming of Christ.
[1:30:43] In her is all his glory, is all his
[1:30:47] wisdom, is all his radiance. Oh, it is
[1:30:50] the brightness of his coming. And what
[1:30:52] does it do? It destroys the strength of
[1:30:54] Satan's kingdom.
[1:30:56] Cast down all lies. Cast downs all
[1:30:58] complexes. It casts down all def. There
[1:31:01] is no defeat in her.
[1:31:02] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] If he's the alltime undefeated,
[1:31:07] undisputed undefeated champion, then so
[1:31:10] are you.
[1:31:11] Hallelujah.
[1:31:14] Brother Luke shared with me a song that
[1:31:17] I just shared and God inspired it to me
[1:31:19] here recently. There'll be no pain
[1:31:21] wasted.
[1:31:23] None of it. Every heartache, every
[1:31:26] sorrow, every loss, every restless
[1:31:28] night, there's not one pain that will be
[1:31:31] wasted. God uses all of it. Every tear,
[1:31:35] every agony, every hurt, every harm,
[1:31:38] every lie, every loss was pregnant with
[1:31:40] glory. and he will bring glory out of
[1:31:44] it. There'll be none wasted.
[1:31:46] And brother Luke shared a song with me.
[1:31:48] God's never lost a battle and he never
[1:31:49] will. It says, "And he never wasted a
[1:31:51] battle."
[1:31:52] Even when you thought you lost it,
[1:31:55] that was actually victory because God
[1:31:58] knows how to bring something out of
[1:32:00] nothing.
[1:32:03] Oh, hallelujah. Rise, shine, for thy
[1:32:06] light has come.
[1:32:08] Why don't we stand to our feet?
[1:32:10] Amen.
[1:32:12] Brother Brandham said the difference is
[1:32:14] just like it was in the beginning when
[1:32:16] there was gross darkness upon the earth
[1:32:19] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:32:21] face of the water and said let there be
[1:32:23] light and God separated the light from
[1:32:26] the darkness. He says, "And I believe
[1:32:29] that we are now living in that hour
[1:32:31] again
[1:32:32] that when God is separating light from
[1:32:34] darkness and he's pressing it to the
[1:32:37] other side of the world, that the light
[1:32:40] might be made manifest."
[1:32:42] The reason he's talking to the church,
[1:32:45] he says, "The reason I say shalom
[1:32:48] is because that it's God's peace."
[1:32:51] That's what I want to bring to you this
[1:32:53] morning for the New Year's. not looking
[1:32:55] back, but we're looking forward to the
[1:32:58] breaking of a new day.
[1:33:00] Now, he gets very specific. There's
[1:33:02] something great laying ahead of us where
[1:33:04] the years has been the joy that we've
[1:33:07] looked forward to the pressing coming of
[1:33:10] the great light. And now he uses this
[1:33:12] definitive language and now we can see
[1:33:15] it breaking over the horizon, the
[1:33:18] horizontal realm. It's breaking between
[1:33:20] mortal immortal and immortality. We see
[1:33:24] it breaking between heavens and earth.
[1:33:26] From an earthbound sickness and troubled
[1:33:28] world into a bright shining day of an
[1:33:30] immortal life and an immortal body and
[1:33:32] an immortal earth that shall never pass
[1:33:34] away. It's shalom unto the church. Now
[1:33:38] it's light coming for the believer.
[1:33:41] It's not up ahead now. It's here.
[1:33:45] Now light is come. Arise, shine. It is
[1:33:48] the rising of the sun. We don't have to
[1:33:50] wait for a joy that's coming. Joy has
[1:33:53] come in the morning. Oh, let us come and
[1:33:56] rejoice your heart.
[1:33:57] Let this be the joy in our spirits. Let
[1:34:00] this be the joy that we fellowship
[1:34:01] around.
[1:34:03] It's light time coming for the
[1:34:04] believers, but gross darkness for the
[1:34:07] people.
[1:34:09] Between mortal and immortality,
[1:34:12] between heavens and earth, earth bound
[1:34:14] sickness and troubled world and a bright
[1:34:16] shining day of immortal life and
[1:34:17] immortal body and an immortal earth. Oh,
[1:34:20] do you feel it? You're between two
[1:34:21] Edens.
[1:34:24] This that's just what's unfolded. From
[1:34:25] the very moment that God pronounced the
[1:34:28] curse upon the earth, it's been moving
[1:34:31] towards the kingdom
[1:34:33] for it to all to be restored again.
[1:34:35] And now we're living
[1:34:38] we're living in the most remarkable
[1:34:40] glorious time.
[1:34:43] And the reason why this age is as nasty
[1:34:45] and filthy as it is for God to prove
[1:34:48] just how glorious you are.
[1:34:51] That's the purpose of all of it.
[1:34:54] Let's bow our heads. Such a good son.
[1:34:57] I I I I want to express this to you now.
[1:35:00] Let him let him separate the darkness
[1:35:05] and let your light shine.
[1:35:08] I say it to you today. Let your light
[1:35:11] shine. Don't let anything stand in
[1:35:14] between.
[1:35:16] Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it
[1:35:18] shine.
[1:35:19] Let it be expressed. Let it live out.
[1:35:24] Cuz God lit that fire for a purpose.
[1:35:28] And no reason breezes of hell can ever
[1:35:32] blow it out.
[1:35:34] I I I challenge No, I don't challenge. I
[1:35:37] I encourage you today if you've never
[1:35:40] received him to receive him. You see, I
[1:35:43] I don't even know where to begin.
[1:35:46] The light today has exposed darkness.
[1:35:51] If there's any sin in your lives, repent
[1:35:53] of it. Anything that's you've done
[1:35:56] wrong, any harm, just ask God to forgive
[1:35:58] you and say, "Lord, I'm coming home
[1:36:00] today with a repentant heart
[1:36:05] and say, Lord, breathe on me like you
[1:36:08] did this earth in the beginning.
[1:36:12] Lord, separate the darkness that is in
[1:36:14] me like you did in the beginning.
[1:36:18] Lord, let me be a light in that city on
[1:36:20] the hill.
[1:36:22] Let me take my place of this new
[1:36:24] Jerusalem
[1:36:26] that I could be a bearer of your
[1:36:27] righteousness.
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:30] Lord, just say, Lord, I'm laying aside
[1:36:31] all unbelief. I'm laying aside my past
[1:36:35] and I'm coming not to a man, not to a
[1:36:38] church, not even to a physical altar. I
[1:36:41] there's not even an altar in this room,
[1:36:44] but to him I come to him tonight and I
[1:36:48] say, "Lord, I'm yours. I'm giving myself
[1:36:50] away to you." Do you know that song? I
[1:36:53] give myself away. Can you play in the
[1:36:55] key of G? I think.
[1:36:58] Let's just pray in our hearts. Our
[1:37:00] gracious heavenly father,
[1:37:03] Lord, we're in awe of this word.
[1:37:08] And what's so beautiful when we stand in
[1:37:10] awe of you,
[1:37:12] there's a there's a message that comes
[1:37:13] back to us that says you're part of this
[1:37:15] very word that you stand in awe of.
[1:37:20] We're part of it.
[1:37:22] Lord, may we never think of ourselves
[1:37:24] anymore as orphans or outcasts.
[1:37:27] May we never think of ourselves as
[1:37:28] aliens.
[1:37:30] May we never have a worldly conception
[1:37:32] of adoption, Lord, to where somehow
[1:37:35] you've taken someone who's not your own
[1:37:38] and made them your own. We always were.
[1:37:42] And I I I rest in that, Lord.
[1:37:46] Lord, maybe it's hard for some of us to
[1:37:49] accept election and predestination
[1:37:50] because we've been placed on the basis
[1:37:52] of free moral agency.
[1:37:55] Father, may we have the same revelation
[1:37:56] that Adam had
[1:37:59] that he was able to choose,
[1:38:02] but he never had a choice that he was a
[1:38:04] son. That's right.
[1:38:06] He came forth as a son.
[1:38:09] These have come forth as your daughters
[1:38:10] and your sons. They had no choice in
[1:38:12] that.
[1:38:13] And Lord, I take my place as a son. And
[1:38:17] I yield my rights as a human to choose.
[1:38:21] And I say, "Let your light shine.
[1:38:25] Let it shine. Let your voice be heard,
[1:38:28] oh God. Let my hands be your hands. Let
[1:38:32] my ears be your ears. Let my eyes be
[1:38:34] your eyes, oh God. Let these feet be
[1:38:37] your feet. Let this body be your body.
[1:38:42] Let your light shine, oh God.
[1:38:45] Let the sun broadcast its rays
[1:38:49] to that soul left in Leodysia.
[1:38:53] I long Lord to see the manifestation of
[1:38:57] salvation in my family in my associates
[1:39:00] and wadeward ones.
[1:39:03] We believe Lord.
[1:39:06] We look at the fallen and we call them
[1:39:08] brother.
[1:39:10] We look at the weak and we call him
[1:39:11] sister.
[1:39:13] We humble ourselves as light to lift
[1:39:16] them up. And I pray for those who stood
[1:39:19] today with a longing in their heart to
[1:39:21] let their light shine. May the word of
[1:39:24] God break away any chain.
[1:39:26] Break away any barrier. Break away any
[1:39:29] image, any wall, any veil. May it be
[1:39:33] torn down right now. Let your wife
[1:39:36] shine. Lord,
[1:39:37] we commit the people to you in the name
[1:39:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:39:41] Amen.
