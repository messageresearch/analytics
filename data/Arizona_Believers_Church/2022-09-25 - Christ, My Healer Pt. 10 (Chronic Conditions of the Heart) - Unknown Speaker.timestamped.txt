[0:00] this is part 10 of Christ my healer I'm
[0:02] going to recap a few things on the
[0:05] promise of wholeness that was our
[0:06] subtitle last time was the promise of
[0:09] wholeness that speaks to soundness we
[0:11] were kind of identifying some
[0:13] completeness as it related to us as a
[0:15] person so that there's Harmony there's a
[0:18] union of the parts and that was the the
[0:20] real emphasis of the promise of
[0:22] wholeness and I had uh and we emphasized
[0:26] a lot on one particular aspect of that
[0:28] but in first Thessalonians let's read
[0:30] the statement from rising of the sun
[0:32] first and the sermon rising of the sun
[0:34] brother Brahman said these people who
[0:36] are fellow citizens of the Kingdom a
[0:39] possessor of quickening power so you're
[0:41] the possessor of quickening power he
[0:43] says Quicken it to them Lord just now it
[0:46] may the spirit go from Eagle to Eagle
[0:48] from word to word till the fullness of
[0:50] Jesus Christ be manifested in each one
[0:53] of the bodies for physical spiritual or
[0:56] any need they have need of that's the
[0:59] idea of wholeness is its every need
[1:01] supplied every issue remedied everything
[1:04] anything that would be causing some
[1:06] disharming or disunity anything that
[1:08] would not be promoting our soundness of
[1:11] mind and soundness of body anything that
[1:13] would be interrupting Harmony that the
[1:15] Holy Spirit would come for physical
[1:17] spiritual or any need that we might have
[1:19] and in first Thessalonians chapter 5
[1:22] verse 23 and Paul making this statement
[1:24] which is just so round to me and so
[1:27] whole and very God of Peace sanctify you
[1:29] holy that means to be perfect complete
[1:31] in all respects that means entire
[1:34] nothing lacking so he says if we're to
[1:36] be Sanctified holy I pray God your whole
[1:39] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[1:42] blameless unto the coming of our Lord
[1:44] Jesus so there's a prayer this is a
[1:47] scriptural promise this is a scriptural
[1:48] desire that we would be whole in our
[1:51] soul in our minds our spirits and our
[1:53] bodies that we would be whole in all
[1:55] those three parts we recognize that
[1:57] brother Branham teaches it this way that
[1:59] there is a a there's a soul a spirit and
[2:02] a body that were three parts and without
[2:04] any one of those you're not complete and
[2:06] so if any one of those is sick or or out
[2:09] of place or or harmed then we're harmed
[2:12] and we're not whole so that's the idea
[2:13] behind wholeness is that the entire
[2:16] person is is touched by the power of God
[2:19] the entire person is healed by the power
[2:21] of God we saw in Isaiah 53 how the
[2:24] atonement spoke to the sickness of our
[2:27] body the sickness of our soul and the
[2:29] sickness of our Spirits our grief and
[2:30] sorrow our iniquities our physical pain
[2:33] by his stripes we are healed so that's
[2:35] what that's what the atonement covers it
[2:37] covers the entire person covers All That
[2:40] You Are and So Divine Healing is more
[2:44] than just healing of the physical body
[2:47] and that's when we think Divine Healing
[2:49] we think oh my body being healed and
[2:50] I'll even I think we recognize this from
[2:53] the teaching of the message that Divine
[2:55] Healing of the body in a temporal sense
[2:57] is just pointing to the ultimate Divine
[3:00] Healing of the change of our body but
[3:02] this Divine Healing we limit it so much
[3:04] in its application and we think oh that
[3:06] means if I have cancer and they do a
[3:08] scan and I have a tumor on a particular
[3:10] organ and I'm prayed for and they come
[3:12] back later and the tumor is gone that's
[3:14] Divine Healing Abraham says all healing
[3:17] is Divine Healing so there's layers to
[3:19] Divine Healing and I'm wanting us to
[3:21] think more about the Divine Healing of
[3:23] the soul and the Divine Healing of our
[3:25] spirit
[3:25] because I think that's what might hold
[3:27] the key even to our physical healing and
[3:29] as brother bam says the born-again
[3:31] possess quickening power
[3:33] we looked at how he said the greatest
[3:34] Miracle is the healing of a sensic soul
[3:37] that's the greatest Miracle to be born
[3:39] again
[3:40] and brother random identifies how that
[3:42] sickness
[3:43] and sin are so closely related that you
[3:47] can't deal with sin without having dealt
[3:49] with sickness
[3:50] and that's what um that's kind of what
[3:52] we're looking at is when the soul the
[3:54] sickness of the soul is dealt with that
[3:57] has ramifications if they use
[3:59] chemotherapy and certain treatments and
[4:01] pills and and they give you a
[4:02] prescription say this description is
[4:04] going to take care of this problem in
[4:06] your body but there's all sorts of side
[4:08] effects and they're usually not good or
[4:10] I'll take that back they're always bad
[4:12] right they never say you're going to
[4:14] take this pill and it's going to help
[4:15] with the headaches and it's also going
[4:18] to give you 10 20 vision
[4:20] right they never say that and they say
[4:22] can cause blurred vision don't operate
[4:24] heavy machinery it's always bad well
[4:26] with this gospel
[4:27] whenever you take it and it heals the
[4:30] soul it can come with side effects and
[4:32] those side effects are very positive for
[4:34] the spirit and the body
[4:36] and and so you can't deal with sin
[4:38] without there being some effect upon the
[4:40] spirit and the body
[4:42] I've been looking at these instances in
[4:44] the scripture quite a bit this I'm just
[4:45] going to read from Matthew chapter 9
[4:47] verse 5. but in the few places that it's
[4:49] mentioned I think there's a couple
[4:50] instances where Jesus uses this phrase
[4:53] and then it's uh mentioned a few times
[4:55] in the gospels from different
[4:57] perspectives but he says for weather is
[4:59] easier Matthew chapter 9 verse 5 for
[5:01] what is easier to say thy sins be
[5:03] forgiven thee or to say arise and walk
[5:07] and I asked the question what what is
[5:09] easier to tell someone that they they're
[5:11] to be healed or to to heal a sickness or
[5:14] to tell someone that their sins are
[5:16] forgiven now we know that both are
[5:18] accomplished by the same divine power
[5:21] that if you if you're to say to someone
[5:24] your sins are forgiven now you could say
[5:26] it all day long your sins are forgiven
[5:28] but it's only God who can remit those
[5:30] sins it's only God or by his power that
[5:32] sins can be remitted so it has to be
[5:34] connected back to divine power so both
[5:36] are accomplished by the same Divine
[5:39] omnipotence to heal the body or to heal
[5:41] the soul but one is seen and the other
[5:44] is unseen
[5:46] right and in the way that Jesus is
[5:48] saying he's saying what is harder you
[5:50] know something that you can actually see
[5:52] and verify or something that cannot be
[5:53] seen if I can do that which is seen and
[5:55] I could do that which is easy to verify
[5:57] do I not also have the power to forgive
[6:00] sins and so it's actually I hate just to
[6:02] kind of brush over it very quickly but
[6:04] you see that connection there we're
[6:06] saying the Forgiveness of sins and and
[6:08] the healing of the body are connected to
[6:10] the same divine power
[6:12] and in John chapter 5 verse 14 as we've
[6:14] read it already this morning when Jesus
[6:17] found this man in the temple I kept
[6:19] wanting to come up with the name for
[6:21] this man in the in in the Book of John
[6:23] and I couldn't really come up with the
[6:24] name if one strikes me I'll just use it
[6:26] because I want to refer to him you know
[6:28] Lemmy or whatever we want to call them
[6:30] so that whenever we I don't have to keep
[6:32] saying the man in John chapter 5 or the
[6:34] sick man uh in John chapter five or keep
[6:36] referring to him
[6:38] um so if you think of a nickname just
[6:39] text it to me and we'll do a poll we can
[6:42] do a Twitter poll or something and
[6:43] figure out what name should we use for
[6:45] the man in John chapter five I call him
[6:48] Cinco
[6:49] but he says uh he says he found Jesus
[6:52] finds him and the temple says behold
[6:54] Thou Art made whole
[6:55] sin no more or less the worst thing come
[6:57] on upon you so there's this connection
[6:59] again to where how one can be healed but
[7:02] the sin of unbelief can undo that why
[7:05] because sin and sickness are related and
[7:07] where their sin their the healing loses
[7:10] its hold I know that's a very
[7:13] um uh a very large thought that brother
[7:17] Bama always touches on how your healing
[7:19] is going to last as long as your faith
[7:20] does now to me that's a staggering
[7:22] comment we're going to read one here in
[7:23] a moment that's very uh very staggering
[7:26] when you consider it and even in Romans
[7:28] chapter 6 verses 22 and 23 it's
[7:31] basically telling us that by the New
[7:32] Birth the power of the law of sin and
[7:35] death has been broken
[7:37] and so by the new birth our souls are uh
[7:40] have been made free from the penalty of
[7:43] sin and and the law of sin so the soul
[7:46] is no longer under the penalty of sin
[7:48] it's no longer under the effects of sin
[7:51] it's been made whole and you have this
[7:53] wholeness in your soul and that's the
[7:55] greatest Miracle there is
[7:57] and we're since I'm preaching to
[7:59] Believers I think it's important to
[8:01] approach Divine Healing not so much in a
[8:03] convention style to where we're just
[8:06] trying to accomplish a healing for the
[8:08] sake of healing and for and to say just
[8:10] to prove that God still heals but so
[8:13] that your your faith can mature and
[8:15] faith can be more available to us in
[8:17] every situation that we need it we're
[8:19] approaching the subject of Divine
[8:21] Healing but we're really approaching the
[8:23] subject of a maturing faith and walking
[8:25] fully in the promises of God and
[8:27] believing him for everything and so when
[8:30] we have this newness of life in our soul
[8:32] then really we're no longer under the
[8:34] penalty of sin
[8:35] and that's when brother Branham touches
[8:37] I I Associated it with these statements
[8:39] where brother Brown talks about how
[8:40] healing is already in US
[8:42] the power of transformation he says and
[8:44] a healing comes from the inside let that
[8:47] healing come from the spirit that's in
[8:50] you
[8:51] and he's talking about those who've been
[8:53] regenerated by the new birth you have
[8:55] eternal life inside of you you have
[8:56] deity inside of you let the healing come
[8:59] from within so think of it this way and
[9:02] maybe hold this thought very near you
[9:04] it's a change of perspective
[9:06] because often we're always trying to
[9:08] chase healing as if it's something that
[9:10] we're trying to find
[9:11] and we give it we give it certain
[9:13] markers on the calendar we give it
[9:15] certain distinctions and the healing is
[9:17] already right inside of you
[9:18] we just use this type at the very end
[9:20] then we talk about cancer being in
[9:22] remission well the Bible says our sins
[9:24] are in remission or our soul is in
[9:26] remission there's no evidence of sin
[9:28] there's no signs of sin you're in full
[9:31] complete remission never to relapse
[9:34] that's the permanence of the new birth
[9:36] and so our soul is in full remission all
[9:38] evidence of sin is gone
[9:41] if you took a blood test you took a scan
[9:42] you took a cancer test you did a biopsy
[9:45] do it whatever you want on the sole and
[9:48] there's going to be no markers no signs
[9:50] even to the point it's a perfect Soul
[9:52] it's never been sick to begin with
[9:54] is that right Dr Jesus he says
[9:56] absolutely
[9:57] how do you know I put it there
[10:00] I've given you a transplant it's made
[10:01] new it's perfectly whole and so that's
[10:03] the thought on the promise of wholeness
[10:06] now my title today and I hope this
[10:07] hasn't messed your notes up just write
[10:09] it out into the margin if you've already
[10:10] taken the title spot but my title today
[10:13] is chronic conditions of the heart
[10:16] chronic conditions of the heart and so
[10:19] what my thesis is that there's barriers
[10:22] to a believer's healing that are often
[10:25] are the barriers to a believer's healing
[10:28] are often in our mental approach to it
[10:31] that so we're Believers so the word the
[10:34] promise has been given and we're
[10:35] Believers so how is it the promise given
[10:38] our faith to the promise what is it in
[10:41] that process that often interrupts our
[10:43] receiving what we even believe in
[10:46] because I think all of us 100 even if we
[10:48] asked the youngest here and they could
[10:49] understand the question they believe in
[10:51] Divine Healing they believe in the
[10:53] Miracles they believe in signs and
[10:54] wonders the faith is there so what is it
[10:57] that caused us to miss it well it's some
[10:59] that that Ravel or that crust that we
[11:02] can't get over that keeps us from
[11:04] receiving our healing
[11:05] brother says You must know how to
[11:07] approach God for healing like you do
[11:09] with salvation so you have to have the
[11:11] right approach and another state
[11:13] statement he says if you do not approach
[11:15] Divine Healing right you will fail to
[11:17] receive your healing
[11:18] that's that's it you don't approach it
[11:21] right so you can believe in it and we
[11:22] and the promise can be there but if
[11:24] you're not coming to it from the right
[11:26] angle he says you won't receive your
[11:27] healing and many times he says and many
[11:29] many times people want to be so
[11:31] tranquilized they want this that or the
[11:33] other
[11:34] so they're looking for something they're
[11:36] looking for even in their approach to
[11:39] Divine Healing they're looking for it to
[11:40] come a certain way they want to be
[11:42] tranquilized they want this they want
[11:43] that even if he's talking about in a
[11:45] literal sense of medication or in a
[11:47] spiritual sense just tranquilize me God
[11:49] and do a Divine surgery and heal me our
[11:52] approach has to be right
[11:54] so I'm wanting to address chronic
[11:56] conditions that actually keep us from
[11:58] being healed
[11:59] and to use that phrase chronic
[12:01] conditions of the heart
[12:03] it's we're looking at how heart problems
[12:05] can cause sickness when I say heart
[12:08] problems I'm not talking about the
[12:09] physical heart
[12:10] but how that the mind as we are Spirit
[12:13] soul and body we're looking at that
[12:14] Spirit part that mind part the emotional
[12:17] part that can actually cause sickness
[12:20] that could be the cause of the sickness
[12:22] so you say God you know deliver me of
[12:25] this and heal this so God could come
[12:26] around and heal the physical symptoms
[12:28] but you haven't dealt with the
[12:30] underlying cause and as long as the
[12:32] underlying cause is causing the physical
[12:34] sickness God can do all day long keep
[12:37] dealing with the symptoms but really
[12:38] what he wants to do is deal with the
[12:40] underlying cause
[12:41] or so it could be the actual cause but
[12:44] it all it can also be the prevention of
[12:45] healing because there's something in
[12:47] your approach something in your attitude
[12:49] that's not right now you say where's the
[12:51] phrase chronic conditions of the heart
[12:53] come from
[12:54] I I use chronic because chronic implies
[12:56] something to just persist it's recurring
[13:00] or it's lasting a long time or something
[13:02] very stubborn very difficult to
[13:04] eradicate and as we read in John chapter
[13:06] 5
[13:07] verse 5 it says the man had an infirmity
[13:09] 38 years that would be a chronic
[13:12] condition this impotent man this sick
[13:14] man had a condition for 38 years this
[13:17] was a chronic condition that he had
[13:19] lived with and Jesus even in his healing
[13:22] of this man looks at it from the
[13:23] standpoint knowing that he had been
[13:25] there a long time
[13:26] so I want us to consider The Chronic
[13:29] conditions of our own heart and how that
[13:32] God must needs heal chronic conditions
[13:35] in our heart perhaps before he can heal
[13:38] the conditions in our body
[13:40] all right that's the that's the
[13:42] foundation James chapter 5 verse 13.
[13:45] this will be the scripture that will
[13:46] almost be a bookend to our thought this
[13:49] morning James chapter 5 verses 13 Even
[13:51] 14 and 15 we know he's if if there's any
[13:56] sick among you he says call for the
[13:58] Elders of the church uh and have them
[14:00] anoint you with oil and the prayer of
[14:02] faith shall deliver or save the sick so
[14:05] what is it that doesn't the prayer of
[14:07] faith heals the sick some of the
[14:09] mechanics to it or if you're sick in
[14:10] body call for the elders to come pray
[14:13] for you them with faith believing anoint
[14:16] you with oil pray for you and it says
[14:18] you shall be well but now this is the
[14:21] first part of that whole phrase is the
[14:23] question is any among you afflicted
[14:27] let them pray
[14:28] is any Mary let him sing Psalms this is
[14:32] a precursor this is what is asked these
[14:35] are the questions that are asked before
[14:36] he says if you're sick call for the
[14:38] elders have them anoint you with oil and
[14:41] pray for you and you will get well he
[14:43] asked the question are any of you
[14:45] Afflicted and that means to suffer
[14:48] trouble
[14:49] actually translated I believe in one
[14:50] place to endure hardness so when Paul
[14:53] asked are any Afflicted he's not
[14:55] referring to the same sickness in verse
[14:57] 14 necessarily but he's talking about
[14:59] the afflictions of the Mind the term
[15:02] Afflicted means a suffering mind the
[15:04] suffering of mind the suffering of
[15:06] emotions the suffering of passions are
[15:08] you finding yourself without ambition
[15:10] are you find yourself Melancholy you
[15:12] find yourself discouraged or you find
[15:14] yourself anxious is your mind all in
[15:16] turmoil are you suffering from emotional
[15:18] or mental or spiritual turbulence or
[15:21] difficulty that's the question he's
[15:23] asking
[15:24] before he gets to verse 14 and says if
[15:26] you're sick and body call for the elders
[15:28] he wants to know are you Afflicted are
[15:30] you married
[15:32] and he appoints to a very important and
[15:34] I can say often over element before we
[15:38] ask for prayer for sickness in the body
[15:41] I believe that it's written this way for
[15:42] a reason I think there's some weight to
[15:45] it that causes us to really examine this
[15:47] I think there's a reason why he asked
[15:49] these two probing questions first to
[15:52] like a doctor would say well where are
[15:54] you here for today and they say well I
[15:55] have this problem he's like well let's
[15:56] back up and starts asking you questions
[15:59] and they're wanting to know more about
[16:01] your situation it says oh have a
[16:02] headache we'll just take this they want
[16:04] to get to the bottom of it you want to
[16:06] find out so James asked are you
[16:08] Afflicted are you married there's things
[16:10] he's putting into place first and if I
[16:12] could use this phrase it's almost as if
[16:14] he's using before you ask for prayer for
[16:17] physical sickness he's at he's applying
[16:19] a conditioned precedent which in
[16:22] contract language that means something
[16:23] that needs to be done first before
[16:25] another thing can be done it's an event
[16:28] or condition that's required before
[16:30] something else can occur so before you
[16:33] call to the elders and ask them to come
[16:35] and pray for you and anoint you with oil
[16:37] that the prayer of faith May deliver you
[16:38] from your physical sickness are you
[16:40] Afflicted in your mind are you Merry and
[16:43] he's asking these questions first
[16:46] like it's our attention doesn't it
[16:48] James is actually looking at the
[16:50] condition of our emotions first before
[16:52] we get on the phone and call the Elders
[16:54] over
[16:55] now in John chapter 5 I'm going to read
[16:57] verse verse 7 to 15. I may not need to
[17:01] read this to you again in his
[17:03] completeness and I want to go a little
[17:04] bit quicker now so let's just really
[17:06] look at this Jesus asked him if he wants
[17:08] to be made whole and verse 7 he says
[17:11] well I have no man to put me in the
[17:13] water when the pool is troubled so
[17:15] notice the conversation do you want to
[17:17] be healed well of course I do but when
[17:19] the water is troubled other people beat
[17:21] me to it and I can't quite get in it but
[17:24] then Jesus just speaks he just kind of
[17:26] interrupts
[17:27] i i as if he's not even really dealing
[17:30] with the man's question but he says Rise
[17:32] take up thy bed and walk verse 8 just
[17:34] speaks to the man and immediately the
[17:36] man was made whole let's think of that
[17:38] soundness this completeness and notice
[17:40] what he does took up his bed and walked
[17:42] and on the same day was the Sabbath
[17:44] that's a very important part to know
[17:46] if you're a Pharisee right it happened
[17:49] on the Sabbath the Jews therefore said
[17:50] unto him that was cured it is the
[17:52] Sabbath day and I want you to recognize
[17:54] this it is not lawful for thee to carry
[17:56] thy bed he answered them so there he
[17:59] rebuked uh he's rebuked
[18:02] um maybe we can just call him John John
[18:04] 5 answers and he says he that made me
[18:08] whole the same said unto me take up thy
[18:10] bed and walk so he says it's not lawful
[18:12] for you to be care in your bed you
[18:13] you've you've gone too far on the
[18:14] Sabbath we've been counting your steps
[18:16] you've gone too far and he's like oh
[18:18] well the man that healed me you know I
[18:20] was sick for 38 years the man who healed
[18:22] me he told me to do it so I did I did it
[18:24] I mean that was pretty good that was
[18:25] good good enough for me that immediately
[18:28] when this man made me well I thought
[18:29] what do you want me to do jump okay how
[18:31] high right it was just I'll do it
[18:34] and he says
[18:36] they asked him what man is that that
[18:38] said this to you verse 12 who said do
[18:41] you take up thy bed and walk and he that
[18:43] was killed verse 13 is very important he
[18:45] that was healed wished not who it was he
[18:48] didn't know who he was
[18:49] he didn't say you know this rabble
[18:51] Rouser this problem cause her he doesn't
[18:54] say anything he says for Jesus had
[18:55] conveyed himself away a multitude being
[18:57] in that place afterward Jesus findeth
[19:00] him in the temple and said unto him
[19:01] behold Thou Art made whole
[19:03] so he was healed of this amality of 38
[19:07] years he says sin no more or less the
[19:08] worst thing come unto thee very
[19:10] important principle The Man departed and
[19:12] told the Jews that it was Jesus which
[19:14] had made him whole
[19:16] out maybe two quick hits on that
[19:20] number one
[19:23] notice how
[19:25] Jesus just I think I've mentioned this
[19:27] before already Jesus Takes that
[19:28] initiative
[19:30] and speaks to him and he's made whole
[19:33] and he has no prior knowledge of who
[19:36] of who Jesus Is Right
[19:39] now to me these are two things you could
[19:41] think about and I don't want to spend
[19:42] much more time on this other than just
[19:44] saying it it speaks to how we don't need
[19:47] to know a whole lot about Christ before
[19:49] we can be saved or before he can be
[19:51] healed prior knowledge and experience
[19:54] and activity in church and understanding
[19:56] and I know all about you I know
[19:58] everything you've done all it takes is a
[19:59] moment for someone who's never known
[20:01] anything about Christ never known
[20:03] anything about the message never known
[20:04] anything about the things of God in a
[20:06] moment without any prior knowledge of
[20:08] experience in the intellectual side and
[20:10] academic side of things can be changed
[20:13] and it also helps us understand how that
[20:15] Divine Healing isn't necessarily related
[20:17] to having prior knowledge or a prior
[20:20] understanding of something
[20:22] I think it's important to recognize
[20:23] those elements now the one thing I want
[20:26] to begin to very really enter into the
[20:28] record to recognize is in a lot of
[20:30] instances Jesus uh says oh you have
[20:32] little faith and oh you have little
[20:34] faith in some places he says no faith
[20:37] um the scriptures talk a lot about
[20:38] something being wrong with someone's
[20:40] faith and then he commends ones for
[20:42] great faith I haven't seen such a great
[20:44] faith oh what great faith and he
[20:47] compliments Faith but here there's no
[20:49] there's no comment about faith
[20:51] so he's not criticized or condemned for
[20:54] the lack of faith and really I will say
[20:56] this despite the fact that he displayed
[20:58] no faith at all
[21:00] Jesus did not withhold from him healing
[21:04] there's no there's no apparent display
[21:06] of Faith it's not like would you be made
[21:08] whole and he says well you know what I'm
[21:10] never the first one in the water but
[21:12] Rabbi if you would if you would pray
[21:14] since you're here I can be healed
[21:16] there's nothing to indicate that he had
[21:18] any faith
[21:20] but it's so there's no condemnation of
[21:23] his faith there's no remarking about
[21:25] little faith or corrupted Faith or weak
[21:27] Faith despite any evidence of him having
[21:30] faith Jesus still heals him now I think
[21:32] that's just an observation I'm not
[21:34] trying to make a Doctrine out of that
[21:35] just saying as we observe it
[21:38] and what we can conclude based upon the
[21:40] scripture is that he did not know who
[21:42] Jesus was
[21:44] and you're gonna have to stay real close
[21:45] with me today
[21:48] I would say
[21:49] that not only is he healed despite his
[21:53] knowledge but his ignorance of who
[21:55] Christ was may have benefited him
[21:58] his lack of knowledge may have helped
[22:01] him in this instance again really stay
[22:04] very close to me today because I'm going
[22:05] to be reading a lot of scriptures to
[22:07] look at that aspect of how this man in
[22:09] John chapter 5 didn't have any prior
[22:11] history healed in a moment and how that
[22:14] applies to us
[22:15] in Mark chapter 6 verses 1 to 6 it says
[22:18] and he went out from fence and came into
[22:20] his own country so these are people that
[22:21] would know him know his family know his
[22:22] history and his disciples follow him and
[22:25] when the Sabbath day was come he began
[22:27] to teach in the synagogue and many
[22:28] hearing him were astonished saying from
[22:30] whence half this man these things
[22:33] now instead of just listening to him in
[22:36] the context of a teacher who's sharing
[22:38] things and able to receive wisdom from
[22:40] him or resonate in their heart saying I
[22:42] don't know who he is or what his
[22:43] background is but this speaks to my
[22:45] heart this this is true this is real
[22:47] wisdom they say where did he get this
[22:49] what wisdom is this which has given him
[22:52] that even such Mighty Works were wrought
[22:54] by his hands how is it that he has
[22:56] wisdom and that these Mighty Miracles
[22:58] are being done by him that recognize
[23:00] this they're not so much wrestling with
[23:02] the fact that wow this is wise this is
[23:04] amazing where did he get it and wow
[23:06] these Mighty Miracles are of God where
[23:08] did he come from this wasn't coming from
[23:10] a real uh just a place of positive just
[23:14] inquisitive not quite sure just want to
[23:16] know like maybe I I remember one time I
[23:19] was in a meeting and a brother was
[23:21] preaching I'd never heard him preach
[23:22] before and it's maybe not a name you
[23:24] hear very much and I was sitting next to
[23:26] brother Donnie Reagan and I was like
[23:27] where's this guy been right and he goes
[23:30] in the word apparently and um and it was
[23:33] like duh man it was it was awesome and
[23:36] so sometimes you can ask and it wasn't
[23:37] brother Wayne awesome it was there's
[23:40] questions sometimes you have you're like
[23:41] hey
[23:42] where did this come from and it's not
[23:44] like where'd you get that you know did
[23:46] you cheat no it's it's a genuine maybe
[23:48] just a sincere question these aren't
[23:50] innocent questions because notice verse
[23:51] three
[23:52] it's not this the carpenter the son of
[23:55] Mary the brother of James and Joseph and
[23:59] of Judah and Simon
[24:01] are not his sisters here with us
[24:04] they had a problem with them because
[24:06] they knew things about them
[24:08] they knew his history they knew his mom
[24:09] and dad they knew his brothers and
[24:11] everyone always asked me were you the
[24:12] one that got kicked out of Louisiana
[24:13] Louisiana camp like no that was my
[24:16] brother's
[24:18] but they know your dad they know your
[24:20] mom they know your history they know all
[24:22] these things about you and that's what
[24:24] was the hang up
[24:25] right is it because they knew they
[24:28] almost Knew Too Much
[24:29] they couldn't just take it as from him
[24:31] that's why it can be very hard on uh
[24:34] when God raises up ministry within a
[24:35] church a lot of times the biggest
[24:36] problem isn't so much the person's
[24:38] inexperience or the immaturity it's
[24:40] everybody else is like I changed his
[24:41] diapers I've watched him since he was
[24:43] this and and they all have a really hard
[24:45] time imagine that the person standing
[24:47] before them is gifted they always see
[24:49] him as 12 years old I'm telling you I
[24:51] think my dad still thinks I'm 12 years
[24:53] old
[24:55] right because it's really hard to
[24:56] imagine oh this your son's almost 50 now
[24:58] he's he's seen some things he's been
[25:00] some places but that's just how people
[25:03] are
[25:04] they always they have a your history
[25:06] kind of travels with you we know his
[25:08] sisters we know his brothers we know his
[25:09] family history he's just a carpenter he
[25:12] didn't go to schools he's not a rabbi we
[25:14] know about this we know about that so
[25:16] Jesus says a prophet is not without
[25:17] honor but in his own country
[25:19] and among his own kin and in his own
[25:21] house and obviously there could be just
[25:23] logical explanations for this but watch
[25:26] the ramifications and he could there do
[25:28] no Mighty work save that he laid his
[25:30] hands upon a few sick folk and healed
[25:31] them and he marveled because of their
[25:34] unbelief and he went round about The
[25:36] Village's teaching
[25:37] now his Fame had already been spread
[25:39] abroad everywhere
[25:40] when they remark about his teaching it's
[25:43] not that they're taking an issue with
[25:45] the moment something he's saying but
[25:47] they even know about all the mighty
[25:49] works that are being done by his hand
[25:50] and you'll read in several different
[25:52] places in the scripture where the fame
[25:53] about him was sent went abroad and
[25:55] people knew who he was and they're
[25:56] hearing things that are being said and
[25:58] they hear this testimony they hear that
[25:59] testimony and here were people with
[26:01] known best plus his ministry they
[26:04] rejected him based upon what they knew
[26:07] right
[26:08] and so when Fame is spread abroad and
[26:10] where someone begins to gain knowledge
[26:13] it's not always good
[26:15] knowledge is not always good Fame is not
[26:17] always always good
[26:18] and I guess I could say specifically
[26:20] when it comes to Christ that just
[26:22] because they knew doesn't mean they knew
[26:25] just because they heard doesn't mean
[26:27] they heard did you know that Jesus of
[26:29] Nazareth raised the dead and it's not
[26:31] like when they hear that and they
[26:32] believe the report they're like this is
[26:35] a miracle where is this teacher where's
[26:37] this Rabbi they're like who
[26:39] Jesus
[26:41] and they're all hung up on isn't he a
[26:43] carpenter I know his brother James
[26:46] right
[26:48] instead of being like he raised the dead
[26:49] right they're taking an issue with his
[26:52] 23andMe profile
[26:56] and so in Mark chapter 11 they asked the
[26:58] question again verse 28 they sent him by
[27:00] what Authority doest thou these things
[27:02] and who gave you this authority to do
[27:04] these things they're always questioning
[27:05] where does it come from who are you what
[27:07] have you done
[27:08] and in John chapter 5 again verse 10 the
[27:11] Jews do the same thing
[27:12] and the healing of this impotent man
[27:15] who Jesus just speaks to and he's made
[27:17] whole the Jews therefore said unto him
[27:18] that was cured it is the Sabbath day it
[27:21] is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed
[27:23] and his answer is he that made me whole
[27:26] the same said unto me take up thy bed
[27:29] and walk
[27:30] now if you recognize this the issue is
[27:33] not with the healing
[27:35] it's in this particular place uh their
[27:38] issue is the fact if I could say it this
[27:40] way their problem relates to a religious
[27:44] legalism a religious tradition their
[27:47] Sabbath tradition the oral history that
[27:50] developed around the Sabbath all these
[27:52] extra weights and things they begin to
[27:54] place upon a person related to Sabbath
[27:56] and so this man is healed on the Sabbath
[27:58] day and like who cares you're not
[28:00] supposed to be walking around on the
[28:01] Sabbath day and so what was hindering
[28:03] them is this breadth of knowledge that
[28:05] they had about the details and the
[28:07] specifics and all these other things
[28:09] that were in the in the view
[28:10] and so their criticism hey you're not
[28:13] supposed to be walking with your bed on
[28:14] the Sabbath day Provence uh
[28:17] prompts of air revealing response from
[28:21] this man
[28:22] I'm doing with the man who healed me
[28:24] said dude said to do
[28:27] I'm doing what he said I'm not
[28:30] questioning it I'm not quibbling with it
[28:32] I'm just doing what he said but the ones
[28:34] that asked the question they're the ones
[28:36] that are always hyper focused on these
[28:38] details that really don't even matter
[28:40] in Matthew chapter 23 verses 23 and 24
[28:43] woe and you scribes and Pharisees
[28:46] Hypocrites for ye paid tithe of mint and
[28:50] anus and cumin
[28:51] they tied on the spices to the precise
[28:55] measure
[28:57] you're so particular about the mint and
[29:01] the anus and the cumin they're very very
[29:03] particular and precise he says and have
[29:05] omitted the weightier matters of the law
[29:07] judgment mercy and faith
[29:10] and then he doesn't he's not saying it's
[29:12] wrong to be precise when it comes to
[29:14] tithing but he says these you ought to
[29:16] have done and not to leave the other
[29:17] undone but he's like you're so hyper
[29:19] focused on these nitty-gritty details
[29:21] you missed the big picture
[29:24] if the nitty-gritty details are part of
[29:26] the big picture you're fine but you've
[29:28] been blinded by this Precision you've
[29:30] been blinded by this legalism you've
[29:32] been binded by these particular elements
[29:34] and you've omitted the other parts that
[29:36] are even heavier or more weighty and I
[29:38] love the language he uses uh just how
[29:40] it's almost poetry how he says you tithe
[29:42] on this and you omit the weight of your
[29:44] matters it's beautiful language and then
[29:46] this verse 24. ye blind guides which
[29:49] strain at a net and swallow a camel
[29:53] strain on a net they can't swallow a net
[29:57] they choke on a net but can swallow a
[30:00] camel
[30:01] this is what this is quite the
[30:03] illustration of what these Pharisees
[30:05] were prone to do
[30:07] is strain on something
[30:09] that should be so easy to accept but can
[30:12] swallow all these other things
[30:15] that are uh that maybe shouldn't even be
[30:18] swallowed just I guess I'm realizing now
[30:21] I'd like to spend more time on this
[30:22] statement just how much it causes you to
[30:24] stop and think
[30:27] you strain on the net but you can
[30:29] swallow a camel
[30:31] but in John chapter 5 this man who was
[30:34] healed
[30:35] he didn't have any objection
[30:39] he's laying there maybe he didn't expect
[30:40] the waters to be moved on a Saturday but
[30:42] he wanted to hold his place and Jesus
[30:43] says would you be made whole he doesn't
[30:45] say yeah but it's a Sabbath sorry
[30:48] he has no objections when Jesus says
[30:50] take up thy bed and walk he didn't say
[30:51] well who are you
[30:52] there's no questions there are no
[30:54] objections there's no explanation even
[30:56] when they say hey it's the Sabbath day
[30:58] what are you doing walking around he
[30:59] says the one who healed me told me to do
[31:01] it
[31:01] so in his mind there's no objections
[31:04] there's no question there's no wrestling
[31:06] but watch the nature of the Pharisees in
[31:09] John chapter 9. I'm going to read to
[31:10] verse 21 this is a very long reading
[31:12] let's just read through it and enjoy
[31:15] these camel swallowers
[31:18] and the way that they approach these
[31:20] things
[31:21] in John chapter 9 verses 1 to 21 and
[31:24] Jesus passed by he saw a man which had
[31:26] been blind from his birth talk about a
[31:28] chronic condition and his disciples
[31:30] asked him saying is this not the nature
[31:32] of all of us master who did Sin this man
[31:35] or his parents that he was born blind
[31:38] the question even sounds funny
[31:40] did this man sin that he was born blind
[31:43] yeah he told a bunch of lies in the womb
[31:44] and I mean it just it ended it right
[31:46] there as far as his eyesight was
[31:47] concerned
[31:49] who sinned this manner's parents that he
[31:51] was born blind
[31:52] Jesus answered I take these things
[31:55] personal today neither this man sinned
[31:58] nor his parents but that the works of
[31:59] God should be made manifest in him I
[32:01] must work the works of him that sent me
[32:03] while this day the night cometh when no
[32:05] man can work as long as I'm in the world
[32:07] I am the light of the world and when he
[32:09] had thus spoken now without any
[32:11] prompting seemingly on the Blind Man's
[32:14] part but by him being called to their
[32:16] attention he spits on the ground makes
[32:18] clay of the spittle he Anointed The Eyes
[32:20] of the blind man with clay and said in
[32:22] him go wash in the pool of Salome which
[32:24] is in by interpretation sent
[32:27] the blind man he went his way therefore
[32:30] and washed and came seeing
[32:32] no objection from the blind man no like
[32:35] whoa wait a minute what are you putting
[32:36] on my eyes
[32:37] it just happens
[32:39] he does exactly what he's told
[32:41] and he's healed
[32:43] now the what causes Jesus to heal this
[32:46] man isn't the initial question of well
[32:48] why is he sick it's got to be a reason
[32:50] for it and perhaps if we could find the
[32:53] reason why he's sick and there's this
[32:55] wrestling he says you know what no man
[32:57] hath sinned that he is sick but that the
[32:59] work of God may be manifest and he does
[33:02] it he heals him verse 8. the neighbors
[33:04] therefore they which before had seen him
[33:07] that was blind said is not this he that
[33:10] sat and begged so now that he's healed
[33:12] the neighbors who know him like this is
[33:13] the beggar this is the blind man he's
[33:14] healed
[33:15] some said this is he the other said he
[33:18] is like him right he's like him but he's
[33:20] not him he's like the blind guy he's not
[33:23] the blame but he's like him he looks
[33:24] like he's just doppelganger it's not him
[33:26] but he said I am he oh no it's me I was
[33:29] the one that was blind but now sees
[33:31] therefore said then to him how were
[33:33] thine eyes opened he answered and said a
[33:36] man that is called Jesus made clay and
[33:38] anointed my eyes and said unto me to go
[33:40] to the pool of Siloam and wash and I
[33:42] went and washed and I received my sight
[33:44] what an accurate testimony
[33:46] he's not trying to reason with it he's
[33:49] not saying well there's clay has these
[33:51] particular properties that when applied
[33:53] to the eyelids breaks up cataracts and
[33:56] things he just said this is what this is
[33:58] what happened no explanation Jesus
[34:01] healed me all healing is Divine Healing
[34:03] he says then said they unto him where is
[34:05] he he said I don't know
[34:07] and now this is where it starts getting
[34:08] interesting they brought to the
[34:10] Pharisees hymn that was that before time
[34:13] was blind and it was the Sabbath day
[34:15] when Jesus made the clay and opened his
[34:17] eyes so this is the problem
[34:21] heals the guy's eyes and they want to
[34:23] get they want to start getting really
[34:25] patented about well what day was it
[34:27] um
[34:28] thanks for raising my dead mom but why
[34:30] on a Saturday
[34:31] right they take issue with the day the
[34:34] fact that it's Society then again the
[34:35] Pharisees also asked him who received
[34:37] his sight he said to them he put clay
[34:39] upon my eyes and I washed and do sea
[34:41] therefore said some of the Pharisees
[34:43] this man is not of God because he
[34:45] keepeth not the Sabbath day others say
[34:48] how can a man that is a sinner do such
[34:49] miracles
[34:51] and there was a division among them they
[34:54] say unto the blind man again really I
[34:55] think it's almost impossible for us to
[34:57] really get an idea of just how chaotic
[34:59] this scene was
[35:01] it's almost like it's some comedy sketch
[35:04] we should maybe have the youth group act
[35:06] this out sometime
[35:08] because it reads like a script and all
[35:10] the personalities and here's the guy's
[35:13] like hey I've been blind my whole life
[35:14] and now I see what kind of Sinner can do
[35:16] something like this do you realize it's
[35:17] a Saturday this man is a sinner and and
[35:19] it's all sorts of all this commotion and
[35:21] all the he's constantly being asked his
[35:23] testimony never varies but there's a
[35:25] division among them and this guy's
[35:26] pretty certain this man anointed my eyes
[35:28] with clay that he made with spit told me
[35:31] to go wash and I can see this is really
[35:34] simple Jesus healed me and now I see and
[35:37] they're all in an uproar
[35:40] and it says they they said to the blind
[35:42] man again what says Thou of him
[35:44] that he that open Thine Eyes what do you
[35:46] say about him he says he's a prophet but
[35:48] the Jews did not believe concerning him
[35:50] that he had been blind so now they doubt
[35:52] that he'd even been blind they're like
[35:53] wrong answer buddy and the and he
[35:56] received his sight so they didn't even
[35:57] believe his test might not really he
[35:59] hadn't been blind before this is
[36:00] somebody else like him
[36:02] he says until they called the parents of
[36:04] him that had received his sight and they
[36:06] asked them saying again think about how
[36:09] crazy this is can you just imagine all
[36:12] these rabbis running around you know all
[36:14] dressed up knocking on doors is this
[36:16] really the guy and they're all in this
[36:18] uproar not not like in a great way
[36:22] like nobody's saying this guy's eyes are
[36:25] opened it's everything else that's in
[36:27] the way
[36:28] and they knock on the door is this your
[36:30] son who you say was born blind how then
[36:32] does he now see his parents answered
[36:34] them and said very good answer we know
[36:36] that this is our son and that he was
[36:38] born blind but by what means he now
[36:40] seeth we know not
[36:42] or who hath opened his eyes we know not
[36:44] maybe a good answer for a lot of people
[36:45] who don't know
[36:48] he says he is of age ask him he shall
[36:51] speak for himself
[36:54] this is the what I want you to consider
[36:57] is we in our minds maybe just Backtrack
[36:59] on these several verses such a struggle
[37:02] for them to accept this miracle
[37:05] and instead of just accepting it they
[37:06] had so many questions even even when it
[37:09] came to the sickness the disciples like
[37:10] did this guy sin that he was born blind
[37:12] and Jesus might have been like what
[37:15] think about the question you just asked
[37:17] me
[37:17] okay was it his parents
[37:20] you know and maybe it was John that did
[37:21] it so he changes the question a little
[37:23] bit but no he says what about his
[37:25] parents they're like so they're they're
[37:26] trying to figure it out this is just the
[37:28] human mind let's figure it out why I
[37:30] could say this about about Elliot Elliot
[37:32] exhibited some various severe symptoms
[37:34] and was very very sick and then I
[37:36] believe God touches them and now what
[37:37] does everybody want to know who knew
[37:39] that he was sick not the Believers but
[37:40] the doctors like we're gonna get to the
[37:42] bottom of this
[37:43] right we're gonna find out what it is
[37:45] it's like well good luck
[37:47] right I don't have any confidence that I
[37:49] can be able to figure out what it was
[37:51] and I said well we're just kind of
[37:52] scratching our heads
[37:53] because that's just human nature
[37:56] it's inquisitive it wants to know it
[37:58] wants to figure things out there's
[37:59] almost this part of us that uh if we're
[38:02] not in the know that we feel as if
[38:04] something is missing or something is
[38:05] lacking so they had questions they had
[38:07] this need for answers they wanted to
[38:09] make sense of all of it and maybe if I
[38:11] could just take it a step further with
[38:12] the Pharisees it wasn't are you sure
[38:14] this is him this is really him he was
[38:15] born blind wow
[38:17] it was like okay so this was him
[38:20] okay well then what day was it and who
[38:23] is this man and this has got to be the
[38:24] devil and and Jesus was confronted with
[38:27] this a lot and he had to say is this
[38:28] house of Satan divided can Satan cast
[38:30] out Satan
[38:32] it really is a paradigm shift in a lot
[38:34] of ways and it's actually a challenge to
[38:35] us to be very careful that we're not
[38:37] just always super critical
[38:39] of things that God can do
[38:42] but it's such a struggle
[38:44] now Paul in second Timothy chapter 2
[38:47] verse 23 tells us but foolish and
[38:50] unlearned questions avoid knowing that
[38:52] they do gender strifes
[38:55] that's exactly what's happening in John
[38:57] chapter nine maybe these aren't the
[38:58] exact questions that Paul is thinking
[39:00] about but I would say that these are a
[39:02] number of questions that lend itself to
[39:04] foolishness and unlearned questions
[39:06] where okay if you keep asking these
[39:09] questions what does the answer matter
[39:12] are we not asking questions that
[39:14] ultimately just get further away from
[39:15] the fact that God Is A Healer gets
[39:17] further away from the fact of the
[39:18] promise of God and you're trying to
[39:20] build a lot of context or add color or
[39:22] something when it's not even necessary
[39:24] I mean here's a good rule of thumb don't
[39:26] ask a question that you don't really
[39:27] want the answer to and so there's a lot
[39:30] of foolish and unlearned questions he
[39:32] says avoid foolish questions avoid
[39:35] ignorant questions avoid unlearned
[39:37] questions avoid asking questions that
[39:39] the answer is just going to lead to
[39:41] strive for disagreement
[39:43] now this could be in the context of uh
[39:45] with others but I'm wanting us to relate
[39:47] this to ourselves how that there's a way
[39:50] that we can start asking questions and
[39:51] wanting to build context and add color
[39:53] to something and it's just leading to
[39:55] more internal strife in our Spirits than
[39:58] it is leading us to a solution
[40:02] my title today was almost the Pharisee
[40:04] in me
[40:07] and then I thought you guys would just
[40:09] would be thinking maybe I was talking
[40:10] about myself only
[40:12] but then if I called it the Pharisee and
[40:14] you then it would be like I'm calling
[40:15] you out and I was like you know what
[40:16] just forget it
[40:18] the Pharisee in us that was it
[40:21] I think we should be honest about the
[40:23] Pharisee in US
[40:25] how each one of us have a have as it
[40:28] were the shadow of a Pharisee
[40:31] who's doing shadow puppets in our mind
[40:34] right
[40:35] one is to consider things what is this
[40:37] what does this look like and what do you
[40:39] see here and we're trying to read the
[40:41] tea leaves and divine in the cloud
[40:42] shapes and there's things that we find
[40:45] ourselves struggling with and this is
[40:46] where I'm coming to the real Crux of
[40:48] what I'm wanting to uh address today by
[40:51] God's grace is we need to be honest
[40:53] about our own struggles and our minds
[40:55] honest about the questions that we have
[40:58] even in our own lives of what if this
[41:00] happens what if it's because of this and
[41:02] what if that and what if what if what if
[41:04] what if we go all these what ifs and
[41:05] then maybe well what sin cause it did
[41:07] this happen did that happen how about we
[41:09] all been there before that in one of our
[41:11] most difficult trials and something is
[41:13] happening we begin to think oh no what
[41:15] have I done to deserve this oh no what
[41:16] did I do that was wrong oh no what if
[41:19] it's this what if it's that well let me
[41:20] just say if there's something you've
[41:22] done that's put you in that position
[41:24] then all you need to do is make that
[41:27] right because God is greater than the
[41:30] situation
[41:33] there's if that's what God is doing I
[41:35] don't know if I'm getting too far ahead
[41:36] of myself but there should there ought
[41:38] not to be any despair if he says well
[41:40] God am I sick because I sin he's like
[41:42] yeah then it's not like oh no
[41:46] it's like Lord forgive me for my sin
[41:49] he's like all right just waiting for you
[41:52] to ask
[41:54] right
[41:55] like we take some of these things on as
[41:57] if it's a sentence
[41:59] because we take the same that we take
[42:00] the same approach too Dr Jesus as we do
[42:03] to our doctors and and we've had some
[42:05] tests done and you're going to get the
[42:06] results and you get all anxious and
[42:07] you're all nervous about the results and
[42:08] oh no what are they don't ever be
[42:10] nervous about the results God has
[42:12] don't ever you're his bride you're the
[42:14] elect don't ever be worried about what
[42:15] he needs to share with you lay it on me
[42:17] Lord let me have it
[42:18] why because he's never going to give you
[42:20] a death sentence
[42:22] he's never going to say he got two
[42:24] months to live he's never he's never
[42:25] going to give make you feel fearful he's
[42:27] gonna say all right this is the deal but
[42:29] this is how we handle it
[42:31] all right this is the problem you've
[42:33] done this that and the other but this is
[42:34] how you fix it you're like I got it
[42:37] take up my bed and walk right there's
[42:39] there's always a remedy with him
[42:41] there's never this being undone there's
[42:44] no there's no despairing there's no when
[42:47] I say despairing like this is the
[42:49] totality this is the sentence this is
[42:52] over I've been rowing God always does
[42:54] things best
[42:56] and this is this is the Pharisee in us
[42:59] that kind of walks down these we it
[43:01] could be a one-man act John chapter 9 in
[43:03] our lives we're the ones asking all the
[43:06] questions we're the disciples on one
[43:08] hand were the Pharisees on another were
[43:09] the parents it's that this chaos in our
[43:12] spirits
[43:13] so James chapter 5 verse 13. we're
[43:15] coming back to this
[43:22] before we call for the elders and have
[43:24] them anoint us with oil and pray a
[43:26] prayer of faith that we might be
[43:27] delivered he says
[43:28] is any among you afflicted
[43:31] remember that Affliction is the
[43:33] Affliction of mind and emotions and
[43:34] passions let them pray
[43:37] is any Mary
[43:40] let him sing Psalms
[43:43] before
[43:44] you text
[43:46] the the minister group
[43:49] and ask for them to come and pray for
[43:51] you
[43:51] are you Afflicted in your mind then pray
[43:56] are you happy no then sing Psalms
[44:00] James is saying if you have an Afflicted
[44:02] mind you're weighed down with questions
[44:04] and speculations if you're if you're a
[44:06] little bit uh lacking hope or whatever
[44:09] it might be
[44:11] I think you could think about this in a
[44:13] very broad context for us
[44:15] that what James is addressing is not the
[44:17] physical sickness but the condition of a
[44:19] person's mind who may be sick physically
[44:22] and there it's very possible I say it's
[44:25] very possible let me just say we are
[44:27] often Afflicted in our minds by virtue
[44:29] of our sickness
[44:31] the the the the disappointments in life
[44:35] we can have scars we can have lost hopes
[44:37] we could have failed expectations a lot
[44:39] of things that kind of happened to us
[44:40] and because those things happen they can
[44:42] tend to have maybe the preeminence in
[44:44] our thought process and James is saying
[44:46] if you have an Afflicted mind then pray
[44:48] he puts it right within your wheelhouse
[44:51] as a Believer right in your
[44:53] responsibility that if something's not
[44:55] quite right in the way that you're
[44:56] thinking and feeling why don't you pray
[44:59] he says are any of you Mary which means
[45:01] to be be in good spirits to be happy to
[45:04] be glad or cheerful
[45:06] so he's saying
[45:08] do you have an Afflicted mind then pray
[45:11] to write your mind
[45:14] if your mind's Disturbed if you if
[45:16] you're losing hope if things are chaotic
[45:18] in your mind if the Pharisee in you has
[45:20] got a lot of shadow puppets that's
[45:22] causing you to see monsters and
[45:23] speculate and ask a bunch of questions
[45:25] and kind of clouds your view of the
[45:27] promise he's not saying call for the
[45:29] elders and have them pray for you he's
[45:31] saying get your mind right first and as
[45:34] a Believer you've got the power of God
[45:36] inside of you to begin to approach God
[45:38] through prayer and prayer will have the
[45:40] way of aligning your spirits in order to
[45:42] receive your healing not very bad
[45:45] I believe and I would assert that a
[45:47] restful mind and a good attitude are the
[45:50] prerequisites to Healing
[45:52] because before you call for the elders
[45:54] to lay hands on you he says are you
[45:55] Afflicted in your mind then pray
[45:59] you can maybe say it this way or if
[46:01] you're sick
[46:02] ask yourself first how are you
[46:04] emotionally
[46:06] what's your attitude like
[46:09] what's your attitude towards the promise
[46:11] if it's not where it needs to be pray
[46:14] are you sad sing Psalms get your spirit
[46:18] right then ask for healing
[46:22] because we have a different situation
[46:24] and this is where I want to make it
[46:26] relevant to us
[46:27] in this gentleman in John chapter five
[46:29] we have a different situation
[46:31] than he did
[46:33] in his mind it was I'm sick and I want
[46:36] to be well and that was it
[46:39] that was the only
[46:40] that was the only factor for him
[46:42] would you be made whole and he's like
[46:44] yeah I want to be made whole but I can't
[46:47] ever get in the water
[46:49] nothing is said about his faith
[46:52] good or bad
[46:54] and if I'm if if you say well brother
[46:57] you're taking you're taking some a very
[46:59] large leap here in in concluding this
[47:02] the scripture does not say he had bad
[47:05] faith or good faith
[47:07] it wasn't little it wasn't great it
[47:08] wasn't lacking it wasn't weak
[47:10] but regardless his condition did not
[47:13] hinder Christ
[47:16] and was the Bible says Matthew 13 58 and
[47:18] he did not many mighty works there
[47:19] because of their unbelief
[47:21] so we know that unbelief can hinder God
[47:24] we know in other contexts unbelief does
[47:26] not stop God but there's Divine will
[47:28] that he does of his own accord there's
[47:30] other things that are to us and for us
[47:32] that requires our faith towards the
[47:34] promise and if we don't believe then we
[47:36] cannot benefit and we cannot receive he
[47:38] did not do Mighty works because of their
[47:39] unbelief so this man who was impotent
[47:42] for 38 years and who was sick for 38
[47:45] years he was able to receive his healing
[47:47] and so it's not that because he had good
[47:50] faith but if I could just say he didn't
[47:52] have bad faith
[47:54] he didn't have a hypocritical Faith he
[47:56] didn't have a confused Faith he didn't
[47:58] have divided loyalties he wasn't like
[48:00] yeah but I was James was my best friend
[48:02] in high school I know too much about you
[48:05] right I dated your sister once this
[48:07] isn't going to work that's not what he
[48:08] he did have these objections to Christ
[48:12] and so brother Brown makes these two
[48:14] statements I don't have the quotes on a
[48:15] slide because they were just very very
[48:16] short but this is this is wow your
[48:20] healing might not be five minutes away
[48:23] your unbelief will keep it away from you
[48:25] as long as you live
[48:28] your healing may not be but five minutes
[48:31] away but your unbelief will keep it away
[48:34] for as long as you live
[48:36] your healing could be right there
[48:38] and the only thing keeping you from it
[48:40] is your unbelief
[48:42] I would say the same mechanics are at
[48:45] work with respect to the man in John
[48:47] chapter five the Healer was right there
[48:49] and the one thing that could keep him
[48:51] away would be his unbelief
[48:54] but in the absence of unbelief God is
[48:56] able to take that initiative and to heal
[48:58] him brother Brown says each person is a
[49:00] spirit and if the spirit is unbelief it
[49:02] hinders
[49:04] so we have a spirit about us we have a
[49:06] kind of an attitude like we said I mean
[49:09] let's just think of it this way have any
[49:11] of you ever been angry
[49:14] right yes like 100 participation we've
[49:17] all been angry but that doesn't mean you
[49:19] are angry right we've all been hungry
[49:23] but so it was a kind of a state of mind
[49:25] or a condition that we're in in the
[49:27] moment and therefore it characterizes us
[49:30] not because that's who I am in essence
[49:32] I'm always angry maybe angry would be a
[49:34] good one we're hungry and angry or we're
[49:36] angry because we're hungry but that's
[49:38] that's temporary because then we can do
[49:40] something and then we're no longer angry
[49:42] and just because you were angry doesn't
[49:43] mean that's what you always are
[49:46] so he says there's a spirit a person is
[49:49] a spirit and if in the moment it's angry
[49:53] if in the moment it's unbelief if in the
[49:55] moment it's hesitant if in the moment
[49:57] it's doubting I was going back over how
[49:59] Peter was able to walk on water
[50:02] and Jesus when he when he began to sink
[50:05] he says he had little faith wow little
[50:08] faith is all you need to walk on water
[50:10] and that's how powerful faith is but
[50:13] unbelief is so powerful that it's what
[50:16] will cause you to sink or the doubt is
[50:19] what he refers to the fear that comes in
[50:20] and interrupts the process so if in the
[50:23] moment our Spirits instead of being
[50:25] receiving receptive and open and free
[50:28] and happy if it's Afflicted and unhappy
[50:31] then that's what causes the
[50:34] characterization of the recipient that
[50:36] hinders the healing
[50:39] in the sermon I am the resurrection and
[50:41] the life
[50:43] Mary said behold the handmaid of the
[50:45] Lord
[50:47] she started rejoicing she was happy God
[50:50] had promised it she knew she was going
[50:51] to have that baby
[50:53] I believe I spoke something about it
[50:54] last night she didn't wait till she felt
[50:56] life she didn't wait till she was
[50:58] positive
[50:59] she didn't wait till any visible sign
[51:01] she just believed what the angel said
[51:04] was the truth
[51:05] there you are if you could just listen
[51:07] please this is coming right to the heart
[51:09] of it the trouble of it is we question
[51:11] God
[51:13] and if we question God we can't believe
[51:15] God
[51:17] now that doesn't tip us over into the
[51:19] realm of the agnostic or the atheist
[51:20] that is talking about if I could just
[51:22] say in that moment God says this is for
[51:24] you and you're like well but God who
[51:25] sinned and what about this and what
[51:27] about that then we're not believing God
[51:29] right the spirit becomes unbelief and
[51:32] that's what hinders our healing may be
[51:34] five minutes away God said your
[51:36] healing's five minutes away instead of
[51:37] us counting down 458 457 right instead
[51:41] of us counting down we're like yeah
[51:44] it'll still be five minutes away
[51:47] but you live your whole life and never
[51:48] get it right unbelief will keep it away
[51:51] it doesn't change the fact that it's
[51:53] five minutes away
[51:54] well you told me my my healing was five
[51:56] minutes away and it's been three weeks
[51:57] it's still five minutes away
[52:01] your unbelief hasn't started the clock
[52:02] yet
[52:06] the trouble is we question God and if we
[52:08] question God we can't believe God faith
[52:10] is the substance things hoped for the
[52:11] evidence of things you don't see
[52:12] tasteful smell are here
[52:15] we're only responding to the chronology
[52:17] we're only responding to the facts or
[52:19] the symptoms or the history well I need
[52:21] to know more about this I need to know
[52:23] more about that listen I know it's taken
[52:25] over the sports world but but the saber
[52:27] metrics and analytics and data it
[52:30] doesn't apply with God
[52:31] he said well in the history of divine
[52:33] healings nobody has ever been healed of
[52:35] lymphoma on a Tuesday
[52:38] after three o'clock if they had a mango
[52:40] for breakfast
[52:41] and so there's like this probably the
[52:43] percentage by with which you can believe
[52:45] you can be healed is it 99 listen it
[52:49] doesn't matter with God
[52:51] it doesn't matter if throughout all
[52:53] history it has never been done God is
[52:56] able
[52:58] but yeah we want to kind of shoehorn
[53:01] things into the picture well what about
[53:02] this what about that
[53:04] if I could say this because what what
[53:05] I'm re I'm relating to Believers and The
[53:08] Chronic conditions of the heart speaks
[53:10] to these conditions in our spirit and
[53:11] our mind that hinder us from receiving
[53:13] our healing and if I could put it this
[53:14] way sometimes Believers I'm talking
[53:16] about real Bona fides real Christian
[53:18] real genuine Believers have heard too
[53:20] much seen too much and felt too much
[53:22] until their heart is not centered on the
[53:24] promise
[53:24] [Music]
[53:26] it's not just the critics
[53:28] it's not just the Pharisees it's just
[53:30] not the neighbors it's not just the the
[53:31] people who heard it's us we're unlike
[53:34] the man by the by the pool because he's
[53:37] just there wanting to be healed and
[53:39] there's nothing else in the way but
[53:40] where they're going yeah but you know
[53:42] I've been I've been in this message 38
[53:43] years and this has happened and this has
[53:45] happened and that's happened and I've
[53:46] prayed and I've asked for this and I've
[53:48] asked for that
[53:49] wow
[53:51] First Timothy chapter 1 verse 5 it says
[53:53] the end of the Commandment of his
[53:54] charity out of a pure heart and a good
[53:56] conscience
[53:57] and faith on
[53:59] feigned
[54:01] faith without the hypocrisy
[54:04] faith without the pretense faith not
[54:07] mixed with doubt
[54:08] faith not mixed with the put on so if we
[54:11] could say we have the faith and the mind
[54:13] of Christ in our soul it's whatever what
[54:15] is what has ever whatever is out front
[54:20] whatever it is that we're pondering in
[54:22] our minds whatever it is we're
[54:23] considering whatever the questions we're
[54:24] asking whatever the Pharisee in US
[54:27] is indicting in the moment
[54:30] he says we ought to the Commandment is a
[54:32] pure heart and a good conscience
[54:34] have to have a pure heart and a good
[54:35] conscience and a faith unfeigned faith
[54:37] unfeigned relates to how our heart the
[54:39] condition of our heart and the condition
[54:40] of our conscience
[54:42] these two other scriptures in first
[54:43] Timothy holding faith and a good
[54:45] conscience
[54:46] which some having put away concerning
[54:47] Faith have made shipwreck if I could say
[54:50] this wreck your conscience you're
[54:51] wrecking your faith
[54:52] if your conscience is wrecked your faith
[54:55] is hindered
[54:56] if your conscience is in turmoil your
[54:58] faith is trying to ride out the waves
[55:01] now does that mean your soul is in
[55:03] turmoil no your soul is wanting to step
[55:05] up Faith is ready to arise but where you
[55:08] are in the moment is the spirit of
[55:10] unbelief the spirit of doubt the spirit
[55:11] of chaos and everything is tossing to
[55:13] and fro and you have all these questions
[55:15] and the guy next to you can be a guy
[55:17] who's been sick 38 years and doesn't
[55:19] know anything about Christ doesn't know
[55:21] anything about the message and he's able
[55:22] to be healed but you're over there being
[55:23] rocked by your history rocked by
[55:25] everything you know rocked by all the
[55:27] quotes Rock by this Rock by that and
[55:29] you're there without the good conscience
[55:32] that faith has to be held in
[55:35] next verse the mystery of faith is held
[55:37] in a pure conscience
[55:39] I would say this is a this is a maturity
[55:41] of thought wow the more I thought about
[55:43] it yesterday it's like this this has to
[55:45] do with attitude and disposition not
[55:47] being pouty not being negative
[55:51] the promise isn't weak
[55:52] his faith isn't weak
[55:54] could it be the weakness of our minds
[55:56] then
[55:57] that's hindering our faith
[56:07] I cheated I just looked at the clock
[56:10] in second Timothy Chapter 2 we're doing
[56:12] great it's really really early
[56:15] in second Timothy Chapter 2 Verse 3
[56:18] thou therefore endure hardness endured
[56:21] affliction
[56:22] endure turmoil as a good soldier of
[56:25] Jesus Christ
[56:27] listen Believers go through it
[56:29] yeah we've seen things we've heard
[56:31] things
[56:32] you don't we those of us who I look out
[56:34] upon a congregation that's that you're
[56:36] Christians you're Believers you're not
[56:37] new to this and even if you are you've
[56:40] been through things you see things
[56:42] uh when you come to Christ everybody's
[56:44] not patting you on the back
[56:46] and the longer we believe Christ more
[56:48] people aren't coming to see things the
[56:49] way we do
[56:51] we're more and more in the minority
[56:52] every day
[56:54] I'm sorry saying endure hardness as a
[56:57] good soldier of Jesus Christ you have to
[56:58] suffer Affliction you have to endure
[57:00] difficulty your minds are going to be
[57:02] buffeted you're going to go through a
[57:03] lot of turmoil a lot of Agony a lot of
[57:05] distress but he says endure it
[57:11] or to endure hardness but not become
[57:12] hard
[57:14] Bill Graham says in Victory Day it seems
[57:15] like a Christian the Christian Life
[57:18] if the fellow is not absolutely centered
[57:20] on Christ the Christian life seems like
[57:22] it holds so many disappointments
[57:26] and that is exactly true
[57:28] that we fail sometimes to see the grace
[57:32] in in the failed expectation we fail to
[57:35] see the blessing in the things that God
[57:37] has moved us away from or kept from us
[57:40] sometimes we fail to see the benefit
[57:42] that was achieved through the suffering
[57:43] so if someone's not completely centered
[57:45] on Christ all we see is the
[57:48] disappointment all we see is the
[57:49] suffering maybe all we see is that we've
[57:51] been sick for 38 years or so many weeks
[57:54] or for so long and we we suffer so many
[57:56] disappointments I've been praying for my
[57:58] healing I've prayed and prayed that this
[58:00] would happen this prayer wasn't answered
[58:01] this happened this person fell away this
[58:03] person was lost this happened this time
[58:05] and it just seems like all the
[58:06] disappointments piled up
[58:08] so Paul tells the Hebrews in chapter 12
[58:10] verse 15 looking diligently lest any men
[58:13] fail of the grace of God and we fail to
[58:16] grasp and see the grace of God and
[58:17] whatever it is he allows for us to go
[58:19] through and if we fail to mix our
[58:21] condition with God's grace and his
[58:24] eternal view the root of bitterness is
[58:26] what Springs up lest any root of
[58:28] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[58:30] thereby many be defiled
[58:32] I could say this when I have endured
[58:34] personal hearts and things I've gone
[58:36] through personally with other
[58:37] individuals there's a part of you that
[58:40] is so hurt and so shocked that when you
[58:42] thought you should see Christ you see
[58:44] quite the opposite if you're not careful
[58:47] to realize that God still
[58:50] no that's what I knew that that would
[58:54] not destroy me knew that he could use it
[58:57] it wasn't going to Define me it wouldn't
[58:59] it wasn't going to defeat me and that my
[59:02] attitude towards it that I must conduct
[59:04] myself with joy in the midst of the
[59:06] trials that he and his wisdom allow us
[59:07] to come to pass and I don't need to say
[59:09] well was that inspired by Satan did God
[59:11] tell him to do it why did this happen
[59:12] but just have the right attitude towards
[59:14] it because if I don't that's when I can
[59:16] get bitter
[59:19] and a brood of bitterness will trouble
[59:21] you
[59:23] our experiences our disappointments lead
[59:25] to that bitterness
[59:27] you have to stay with me I'm going to
[59:28] try to go very very quickly here and the
[59:30] sermon uniting time and sign
[59:34] did I not give the title on that are
[59:36] there okay there it is I think one of
[59:37] the horriblest things is to see a man or
[59:38] a woman that's constantly complaining
[59:41] I've always thought God keep me from it
[59:44] say that weak and safe all the time you
[59:46] know
[59:48] the constant complaining you take
[59:50] whatever you need to
[59:52] that relates to this chronic condition
[59:55] of your mind
[59:57] complaining negativity fear doubt he
[1:00:01] says it weakens Faith all the time
[1:00:03] to complain well it's true it's not
[1:00:05] helping
[1:00:07] sometimes we think just because it's
[1:00:08] true it's okay to say it
[1:00:10] and well it's not complaining it's true
[1:00:13] no listen to this someone who's
[1:00:15] constantly complaining says that weakens
[1:00:17] Faith all the time now this principle he
[1:00:19] points to I know as we get older as they
[1:00:21] get older each one of us we're going to
[1:00:23] get something happen and something
[1:00:24] happened he's acknowledging that as you
[1:00:27] live things add up
[1:00:29] things happen all of us now listen we go
[1:00:32] through things we go through things we
[1:00:34] go through things he says I know those
[1:00:36] little things are going to keep
[1:00:37] accumulating that as you get older they
[1:00:39] just got to
[1:00:41] but he says listen I think one of the
[1:00:44] most horrible things is for Satan to
[1:00:46] Crown some person's life a grabbed old
[1:00:48] man or an old woman
[1:00:50] I hope I don't get to that place that
[1:00:53] should shock us brother Branham realize
[1:00:55] the potential for even a Son of God to
[1:00:57] get to the place where things just add
[1:01:00] up and in the end they're just cranky
[1:01:02] they're just critical they're cynical
[1:01:04] and they and this person that and this
[1:01:06] person this and no one preaches it the
[1:01:08] way I do it yeah
[1:01:12] right and that's all everything ever is
[1:01:15] like and you can't share anything oh
[1:01:17] well yeah guess what happened I was
[1:01:20] reading a quote the other day and
[1:01:21] brother Brad said this and I read that
[1:01:22] in 67 son right it's like oh sorry to
[1:01:26] bring up a bad memory
[1:01:29] it's like there's no rejoicing there's
[1:01:31] no Liberty there's no freedom
[1:01:34] they're cankered and crabbed up
[1:01:36] I hope I don't get to that place listen
[1:01:39] how he speaks this is the word being
[1:01:41] spoken to that person I hope I can bear
[1:01:44] it
[1:01:45] my burdens
[1:01:48] I hope I can bear it listen we're not
[1:01:50] saying Lord I don't want to go through
[1:01:51] it Lord I don't want to see it I don't
[1:01:53] want to experience it no I want to be
[1:01:54] able to bear it
[1:01:56] want to be able to go through it
[1:01:57] and get to a spot where I want my life
[1:01:59] crowned with the glory of God his
[1:02:01] long-suffering gentleness peace meekness
[1:02:03] and filled the Holy Spirit
[1:02:06] oh and I'm not asking that you take away
[1:02:08] the Buffett and you take away the pain
[1:02:09] you take away the rejection that you
[1:02:11] take away all the difficulties and
[1:02:13] problems but Lord let me mature to the
[1:02:15] place where my faith is not pouty my
[1:02:17] disposition is not negative and cynical
[1:02:19] and critical but Lord let me get to the
[1:02:21] place where I can be long-suffering
[1:02:22] gentle peaceful Meek because I'm filled
[1:02:25] with the spirit let that be the crowd
[1:02:27] let the man the crown of my life be that
[1:02:30] I never had another trouble but let it
[1:02:32] be that in the midst of my trouble I
[1:02:34] kept my spirit clean
[1:02:38] and I know that chronic pain causes
[1:02:40] causes chronic complaining
[1:02:43] I think my one of my children told me
[1:02:45] listen the church nobody in the church
[1:02:46] knows who ior is whenever I reference
[1:02:48] Eeyore okay well maybe we'll play a clip
[1:02:52] but it's the the donkey in
[1:02:55] Winnie the Pooh
[1:02:57] I almost said Peter Rabbit
[1:03:00] Winnie the Pooh
[1:03:02] and uh
[1:03:03] and he it's always this real dour right
[1:03:09] I think it was brother Eugene Braun who
[1:03:11] first used it I was like yes that's it
[1:03:13] that was a really good impression that
[1:03:15] scares me
[1:03:16] right but it's just that's the kind of
[1:03:19] that attitude it's always negative right
[1:03:21] horse walks into the bar and the
[1:03:23] bartender says so I have a long face
[1:03:25] right that's just kind of like always
[1:03:27] sad and always disappointed and always
[1:03:29] undergoing
[1:03:31] I I'll admit I've I've been that person
[1:03:34] because man we all can't be like brother
[1:03:35] John Andy's right
[1:03:37] look at everything I want everything to
[1:03:39] always be such a blessing right
[1:03:41] I want everything to always be so
[1:03:43] wonderful
[1:03:44] and that's where we really need to be in
[1:03:46] some ways to be positive
[1:03:49] to be under expectation like man
[1:03:52] this is the worst day of my life
[1:03:54] that means it only gets better
[1:03:56] what if it gets worse then that means
[1:03:58] the bet is gonna even be better
[1:04:04] and I know when we go through things
[1:04:05] chronically
[1:04:07] it's very real
[1:04:10] James chapter 5 verse 9 Grudge not
[1:04:12] against another brother unless you be
[1:04:14] condemned
[1:04:15] behold the judge standeth before the
[1:04:18] door
[1:04:19] if I could paint the picture very
[1:04:21] quickly if you just somehow related this
[1:04:22] to yourself grudging condemns you
[1:04:26] not just against one another because
[1:04:28] that's certainly true but the grudging
[1:04:30] the complaint Grudge means to complain
[1:04:31] and to groan
[1:04:34] it leads to your condemnation and you
[1:04:36] are even your own judge
[1:04:39] because you know when you're grudging
[1:04:41] and if you're a Believer you don't like
[1:04:44] it you know it's not right
[1:04:46] there's something in you that's telling
[1:04:48] you you know you shouldn't feel this way
[1:04:49] so you're condemning yourself
[1:04:52] it's not like God is sitting there going
[1:04:54] brother what are you thinking you're
[1:04:56] over there looking you said Aaron what
[1:04:57] are you thinking
[1:04:59] you don't need another to judge you
[1:05:01] fans at the door it's right there within
[1:05:03] you when we're grudging we feel
[1:05:04] condemned
[1:05:06] brother random says that God is in his
[1:05:08] people I'm wanting to I have to do I
[1:05:10] want to go through this very quickly
[1:05:12] to identify
[1:05:13] how that God is speaking the word is
[1:05:16] speaking to this inner turmoil not
[1:05:18] talking about the soul but we're wanting
[1:05:20] to address the healing of our body and
[1:05:22] there's places the believer gets that
[1:05:24] keeps them from having the right
[1:05:25] attitude towards the word he heals the
[1:05:27] Methodist Baptist Catholic Pentecostal
[1:05:29] and all God don't respect your church
[1:05:32] affiliation he expects your respects
[1:05:35] your faith in him
[1:05:37] he don't even you don't even have to be
[1:05:41] a Christian to be healed amen
[1:05:43] amen but in order to order to stay
[1:05:45] healed you have to become a Christian go
[1:05:47] ye and sin no more worst thing a worse
[1:05:50] thing than this will come upon you I
[1:05:51] think it makes a lot of sense but notice
[1:05:53] you don't have to be a Christian to be
[1:05:54] healed it says nothing about how long
[1:05:56] it'll last or how long you'll stay
[1:05:57] sickness free they say you don't have to
[1:06:00] be a Christian he says I've seen many
[1:06:01] times the callous saints come through
[1:06:04] the prayer line men and women who've
[1:06:06] lived Godly and failed to be healed when
[1:06:08] prostitutes on the street would come
[1:06:10] through the line and be healed depends
[1:06:12] on your faith
[1:06:13] why
[1:06:16] why would a saint be in a prayer line
[1:06:17] not be able to be healed and a
[1:06:19] prostitute would he says that the
[1:06:20] calloused saint
[1:06:22] what's callous not the soul it's the
[1:06:24] heart
[1:06:25] the heart's just calloused
[1:06:27] seeing too much heard too much thinking
[1:06:29] too much wondering too much
[1:06:31] questioning too much
[1:06:34] where the prostitutes just like the man
[1:06:35] who had the pool of Bethesda
[1:06:37] what he what yes
[1:06:42] and the message Elijah brother says
[1:06:43] sometimes the adults are so callous the
[1:06:45] Holy Spirit just can't speak to them
[1:06:49] so he of course the scripture suffered
[1:06:51] the little children to come unto me
[1:06:52] forbid them not such as the kingdom
[1:06:55] what is it about a little child their
[1:06:57] experience doesn't get in the way
[1:07:00] there the the the
[1:07:02] innocence when a child begins to talk
[1:07:04] about God and Jesus is admirable
[1:07:07] and when when my children talk about God
[1:07:10] and and especially as they when that
[1:07:13] very young it's so real to them that
[1:07:14] even their questions are very revealing
[1:07:17] because you realize they have accepted
[1:07:20] it so absolutely that it's ramifications
[1:07:23] are absolute
[1:07:26] to where it's like so if Jesus is in my
[1:07:28] heart what about this and what about
[1:07:29] that
[1:07:30] there's this innocence there's a
[1:07:32] sensitivity they're tender
[1:07:34] this is what a childlike faith is a
[1:07:36] child like faith is just takes God in
[1:07:38] his word and is not supplementing it
[1:07:40] with everything else that says but but
[1:07:44] there's no Pharisee in them
[1:07:47] brother in the sermon God's provided
[1:07:48] Place provided a way of approach to
[1:07:50] Fellowship says I see over here on my
[1:07:52] left even some little children you know
[1:07:54] the scripture speaks of a little child
[1:07:55] leading them in Isaiah chapter 10 their
[1:07:57] hearts not been pulled through so much
[1:07:59] of the world till they're young and
[1:08:01] tender they love God and God loves them
[1:08:03] and he can talk to them now this is us
[1:08:05] we've seen so many disappointments and
[1:08:08] things it's hard for our hearts
[1:08:10] and many times we get pulled through old
[1:08:12] true story magazines and stuff of the
[1:08:14] world and that should never have been
[1:08:16] there it's calloused it
[1:08:18] number of statements that talk about how
[1:08:20] the world callouses it but then it also
[1:08:22] relates to experiences the calicit
[1:08:24] disappointments and things things Harden
[1:08:26] our heart and listen don't think that as
[1:08:28] a Believer you can be pulling yourself
[1:08:29] to a bunch of nonsense and worldliness
[1:08:31] whatever it might be whether it be
[1:08:33] sports or entertainment and don't think
[1:08:35] that that doesn't have an effect on your
[1:08:36] heart
[1:08:37] that that doesn't impact you when you
[1:08:39] stand before God to ask for a promise
[1:08:41] it's callous it says God will take away
[1:08:43] every callous off you if you'll just let
[1:08:45] them make you tender sweet kind-hearted
[1:08:47] loving forgiving one another if you'll
[1:08:49] just have faith just believe
[1:08:52] I need Faith first from my mind and my
[1:08:54] heart
[1:08:55] I need to ask myself am I Afflicted if I
[1:08:58] am pray if I'm not happy I need to sing
[1:09:00] Psalms everyone says the little child
[1:09:02] wasn't callous like many adults you just
[1:09:04] have faith with belief
[1:09:07] there's a callousness there
[1:09:11] that's what I'm looking at in The
[1:09:12] Chronic conditions of the heart
[1:09:15] in second Kings chapter five we'll look
[1:09:17] at this very quickly if you read start
[1:09:19] with verse 1 to verse 14 it tells us how
[1:09:20] Naaman he was a captain in the Syrian
[1:09:22] Army
[1:09:23] and he had a wife
[1:09:25] uh who's I believe whose servant was a
[1:09:28] believer
[1:09:30] and and through the process the the king
[1:09:32] petitions they petition the king of
[1:09:34] Israel for healing about the prophet
[1:09:37] there's a there's a Healer in Israel
[1:09:39] there's a prophet in Israel in petition
[1:09:41] for healing
[1:09:42] and King Israel gets all upset about it
[1:09:44] but Elisha is like hey this is the
[1:09:45] chance for God to make himself known so
[1:09:47] Naaman actually come begins to come to
[1:09:49] Elijah as he comes Elijah he has ten
[1:09:52] silver talents he has six thousand
[1:09:54] pieces of gold and he's got 10 suits
[1:09:57] like he's going to load Elisha up for
[1:09:58] the healing
[1:10:00] it says in verse 10 and Elisha sent a
[1:10:02] messenger unto him saying go in wash in
[1:10:04] Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall
[1:10:07] come again to thee and thou shalt be
[1:10:08] clean
[1:10:09] now if you recognize this here's an
[1:10:11] important man come in with a lot of
[1:10:14] reward for the prophet for his healing
[1:10:18] and the prophet doesn't even meet with
[1:10:19] them
[1:10:20] talk about big timing the big guy right
[1:10:23] here's the here's the captain coming and
[1:10:26] the prophet said no just sent somebody
[1:10:27] else to go tell them what to do go wash
[1:10:29] in the Jordan seven times dip seven
[1:10:31] times a Jordan and you'll be clean
[1:10:32] notice naaman's response he was Roth and
[1:10:35] went away and said behold I thought he
[1:10:37] will surely come out to me and stand and
[1:10:39] call in the name of the Lord his God and
[1:10:41] strike his hand over the place and
[1:10:42] recover the leper
[1:10:44] this is what we think sometimes
[1:10:47] really this is how it has to happen
[1:10:48] surely this is the way that it ought to
[1:10:49] be and not are not obana and farpa
[1:10:53] rivers of Damascus better than all the
[1:10:55] Waters of Israel so now he's just taking
[1:10:57] issue with where he wants them to dip
[1:10:58] and everything May I'm not wash in them
[1:11:00] and be clean he is just angry
[1:11:03] right James would say are you happy
[1:11:04] apparently not sing Psalms
[1:11:07] are you Afflicted in mine yes yes
[1:11:10] pray
[1:11:12] like let's not worry about your leprosy
[1:11:14] because right now your biggest problem
[1:11:15] your healing is five minutes away
[1:11:17] but you got all sorts of stuff out front
[1:11:19] that's going to keep you from it so
[1:11:20] let's deal with this other stuff first
[1:11:23] let's think about these other things
[1:11:24] first because all he said you need to do
[1:11:26] is dip yourself in this water seven
[1:11:28] times and you'll be clean and you're
[1:11:30] over here going we didn't even come out
[1:11:31] to meet me and I thought for sure he'd
[1:11:33] lay his hands on me he would call him I
[1:11:36] thought it'd be a more demonstrative
[1:11:37] prayer I went up for prayer and all the
[1:11:39] brother said was receive his healing in
[1:11:40] the name of Lord Jesus Christ he didn't
[1:11:42] even raise his voice
[1:11:44] ah
[1:11:47] and he says in his servant came near his
[1:11:51] servants came near now they begin to
[1:11:52] recognize this I said my father if the
[1:11:56] prophet had bid me to do some great
[1:11:57] thing would have thou not have done it
[1:12:01] right so there's this pretense
[1:12:04] there's wrong kind of attitude says now
[1:12:06] if you were asked to do something very
[1:12:07] demonstrative something very visible
[1:12:10] something very important would have you
[1:12:11] done it
[1:12:12] and obviously he's like yeah
[1:12:15] how much rather than when you say it to
[1:12:17] thee wash and be clean
[1:12:20] like if you want something so great and
[1:12:22] demonstrative if you would believe that
[1:12:25] if sometimes listen I think this is so
[1:12:27] pertinent sometimes we're asking God to
[1:12:29] go ahead and write it in the sky and
[1:12:32] believe in the great thing and like
[1:12:34] that's going to be enough and it's like
[1:12:35] well if you would believe in that why
[1:12:36] don't you just simply believe it
[1:12:38] like if you could believe the great
[1:12:40] thing or want to do a great thing how
[1:12:41] much more just the simple taking God at
[1:12:43] his word so he says how about just wash
[1:12:45] and be clean and that made him no longer
[1:12:48] angry
[1:12:49] he was no longer Afflicted he was no
[1:12:51] longer disconcerted then he went down
[1:12:53] and dipped himself seven times in Jordan
[1:12:55] and to me this is the double application
[1:12:57] according to the saint of the man of God
[1:12:59] and his flesh came again like under the
[1:13:01] Flesh of a little child and he was clean
[1:13:03] there's your wholeness that's the kind
[1:13:05] of faith we need to have sometimes we're
[1:13:07] a name and sometimes we're a Pharisee we
[1:13:09] fought way too many battles we've
[1:13:11] experienced too much unbelief we've had
[1:13:13] too many disappointments we've got way
[1:13:14] too many calluses way too many scars and
[1:13:16] we can't just take the word of God from
[1:13:18] the prophet to believe it we start
[1:13:20] trying to dissect it we try to start
[1:13:22] reasoning with it instead of just taking
[1:13:24] the token and applying it instead of
[1:13:25] just doing what it says and listen
[1:13:27] that's where your wholeness is is to
[1:13:29] come back to be a simple childlike Faith
[1:13:32] to believe it and just do it
[1:13:37] his heart whether you want to talk about
[1:13:39] his mind or his emotions they were
[1:13:40] healed first they were aligned first in
[1:13:42] order for his body to be healed
[1:13:44] I didn't go so far as to say he he
[1:13:46] overcame his immature objections like
[1:13:48] yeah so what
[1:13:50] really sometimes we maybe need to listen
[1:13:52] to ourselves or we just need to be
[1:13:53] honest with each other on some of these
[1:13:55] things that say and say really
[1:13:58] you got all this going on and that's
[1:13:59] what you're worried about
[1:14:02] the other man said it this way and then
[1:14:04] Jesus came he said no one prayed no one
[1:14:06] touched it at all talking about that
[1:14:08] baby but God touched the baby
[1:14:10] the presence of the Lord was here to
[1:14:12] heal why did it get it it was a baby it
[1:14:15] didn't have the superstitions and
[1:14:16] callousnesses calluses and wonderings
[1:14:19] that we have
[1:14:22] we have superstitions wonderings
[1:14:25] calluses
[1:14:27] these are all the things that get in the
[1:14:29] way
[1:14:32] and Paul says having therefore these
[1:14:34] promises dearly beloved second
[1:14:35] Corinthians 7 1 let us cleanse ourselves
[1:14:37] from all filthiness of the Flesh and
[1:14:39] spirit
[1:14:40] perfecting Holiness in the fear of God
[1:14:44] all unfilthiness we could look at the
[1:14:47] flesh the filthiness of the spirit
[1:14:51] defilement is that by which anything is
[1:14:53] defiled he's talking about the pollution
[1:14:54] of our spirits
[1:14:56] what pollutes our Spirits temper
[1:14:58] bitterness grudging unforgiveness we'll
[1:15:02] get into some more of these details the
[1:15:03] the connection between forgiveness and
[1:15:05] healing is so powerful
[1:15:08] Pride jealousy Revenge
[1:15:12] you say what is the fact that I hold a
[1:15:14] grudge against my parents have anything
[1:15:16] to do with my healing
[1:15:18] could be the reason why you're sick
[1:15:22] that's what the message teaches us could
[1:15:24] be the reason why you're sick you're
[1:15:25] like well what is why do I have to
[1:15:26] forgive them in order to be healed it
[1:15:28] may be the reason why you're not well
[1:15:30] you've grudged and it's bringing your
[1:15:32] whole body down discouragement being
[1:15:34] hopeless these are the chronic
[1:15:36] conditions of the heart
[1:15:38] and the message expectation brother says
[1:15:40] now just believe him tonight and he'll
[1:15:41] do you the same way for he's no respect
[1:15:43] to person he's respecting faith God will
[1:15:47] only honor Faith even your salvation
[1:15:49] sometimes won't atone for your healing
[1:15:51] not the merits of your salvation you're
[1:15:54] not healed by that you're healed by the
[1:15:56] Merit what a phrase the Merit of your
[1:15:58] faith I've seen Christians come to the
[1:16:01] platform renowned Christians and fail to
[1:16:04] be healed and see a prostitute walk on
[1:16:06] the platform be healed instantly because
[1:16:08] the Christian had been drugged through
[1:16:10] many places and the skeptic kind of
[1:16:13] believing wonder if the days of Miracles
[1:16:15] have passed and they'll go off missing
[1:16:17] it now instead of trying to apply that
[1:16:19] template to us what kind of skepticism
[1:16:21] may we have when it comes our healing it
[1:16:23] may not be that the days of Miracles are
[1:16:25] passed it but it may be some line of
[1:16:28] reasoning or questioning to what we've
[1:16:30] just been drugged through places well
[1:16:32] I've had this condition for so long or
[1:16:34] it just keeps getting worse or maybe
[1:16:36] this is going to happen and what we're
[1:16:38] doing is we're trying to come up with a
[1:16:40] scientific explanation or rationalize
[1:16:43] instead of just saying God can heal me
[1:16:44] whenever he wants to and that's just
[1:16:45] where I leave it right there
[1:16:48] and a poor prostitute come to the
[1:16:49] platform knowing she's guilty condemned
[1:16:51] before God there give her heart to
[1:16:53] Christ be healed instantly just walk
[1:16:55] away so it's on the Merit of your faith
[1:16:59] Merit of your faith the worth of your
[1:17:02] faith
[1:17:03] it's on the I just the
[1:17:06] the spiritual credit of your faith your
[1:17:10] faith is what gives the credit
[1:17:14] to marry something in his condition
[1:17:15] that's deserving of a reward
[1:17:18] condition of something the conduct that
[1:17:21] deserving meritorious you merited this
[1:17:23] it's something I listen it's a mouthful
[1:17:27] but he's saying that if on the merits of
[1:17:29] your faith that your faith is what
[1:17:31] brings it so the worth of your faith the
[1:17:34] value of the faith how clean and pure
[1:17:36] your faith is
[1:17:38] and that Faith relates to the condition
[1:17:40] of your heart
[1:17:42] because he says your own salvation isn't
[1:17:44] what is atoning for your healing so
[1:17:47] God's not looking at the condition of
[1:17:48] the soul to heal your body he's looking
[1:17:51] at the condition of your faith or your
[1:17:53] heart to Grant you the blessing
[1:17:56] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:17:57] about your mood
[1:18:00] that's what if you're in a bad mood
[1:18:02] you're not going to get healed
[1:18:04] maybe I should just put that as the
[1:18:06] title
[1:18:07] and just have one slide on the archive
[1:18:10] if you're in a bad mood you're never
[1:18:11] gonna get healed
[1:18:14] do you agree
[1:18:17] if you're in a bad mood you're never
[1:18:18] gonna get healed
[1:18:21] if you're in a bad mood you're not going
[1:18:22] to enjoy this service
[1:18:25] it colors everything
[1:18:30] it's your attitude
[1:18:31] brother man said your right mental
[1:18:33] attitude towards any Divine promise
[1:18:36] says he will bring it to pass
[1:18:38] if you can get yourself in position to
[1:18:40] believe that that promise was to you
[1:18:44] what does it have to do attitude
[1:18:46] questions speculations reasonings
[1:18:50] so by getting yourself in position what
[1:18:52] does attitude have to do with viewpoint
[1:18:54] how you view something
[1:18:56] says the right mental attitude towards
[1:18:58] any Divine promise of God will bring it
[1:18:59] to pass if you can look at it in the
[1:19:01] right way
[1:19:02] that's what attitude is about you're
[1:19:04] feeling towards something your opinion
[1:19:06] your disposition is talking about your
[1:19:07] posture your point of view
[1:19:10] it's the way that you're looking at it
[1:19:14] let me close on this
[1:19:16] in first John chapter 3 verses 18 to 22.
[1:19:21] I'm skipping a quote where brother Brown
[1:19:22] says sometimes you can just call us
[1:19:23] yourself
[1:19:25] just by the way you read the promise you
[1:19:27] can callous yourself
[1:19:30] I'm closing here my little children let
[1:19:32] us not love and word neither in tongue
[1:19:34] but indeed in the truth
[1:19:36] and hereby we know that we are of Truth
[1:19:38] and shall assure our hearts before him
[1:19:41] for if our heart condemn us God is
[1:19:43] greater than our heart and knoweth all
[1:19:45] things
[1:19:47] grudges bitterness
[1:19:50] it all condemns us why you condemn
[1:19:52] yourself
[1:19:53] if you didn't know any better you
[1:19:55] wouldn't be condemned
[1:19:56] but you know better
[1:19:58] it's the chronic condition of the heart
[1:20:01] it's there
[1:20:02] in your spirit
[1:20:04] but he tells you if your hearts condemn
[1:20:06] you God's greater and knows all things
[1:20:09] he's wanting you to fill and know
[1:20:12] there's deliverance from this
[1:20:14] greater is he that is in you that
[1:20:16] there's a there's a that you're that's
[1:20:18] not the end of the story when we condemn
[1:20:20] ourselves it's the greatest condemnation
[1:20:22] but he says God is greater than your
[1:20:24] heart and then he says beloved if our
[1:20:26] heart condemn us not then we have
[1:20:27] confidence towards God you know he wants
[1:20:29] us to have hearts at Liberty and
[1:20:32] whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:20:34] because we keep his Commandments and do
[1:20:36] those things that are pleasing in the
[1:20:37] sight to be condemned it means to find
[1:20:40] fault with because of our experiences
[1:20:42] and we should never do that
[1:20:44] if we prayed for a billion people and
[1:20:46] not one of them got healed we should
[1:20:48] still expect in the next prayer a person
[1:20:50] is going to get healed
[1:20:52] I know that sounds crazy and maybe a a
[1:20:54] data person like listen
[1:20:57] but in God we trust everyone else bring
[1:21:00] data
[1:21:06] Bill what was your dad that first told
[1:21:07] me that he had a co-worker who had a
[1:21:09] sticker on a cabinet said that and I was
[1:21:11] like I'm going to use that the rest of
[1:21:12] my life
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] nice
[1:21:20] it doesn't matter to me
[1:21:23] what the experience is I'm not going to
[1:21:25] lower my expectations
[1:21:28] it doesn't matter what I've been through
[1:21:29] it doesn't matter what's happened I'm
[1:21:31] not going to lower my expectations
[1:21:33] and we'll do it because of painful
[1:21:34] memories
[1:21:36] we talked about triggers and being numb
[1:21:37] there's a way that we build ourselves in
[1:21:39] a place where we never want to trust
[1:21:40] again because we don't want to be
[1:21:42] disappointed well that may work with
[1:21:44] somebody but don't do it with God
[1:21:48] past disappointments our own failures
[1:21:50] mistakes these all become The Chronic
[1:21:52] conditions of the heart
[1:21:55] I know I'm closing now if we could just
[1:21:57] ready our hearts now we just bring it to
[1:21:59] this close if you can make it really
[1:22:00] personal
[1:22:02] and I want to see you when when the
[1:22:03] Bible says if our heart condemns us God
[1:22:06] is greater than your heart I believe
[1:22:07] that God wants to address your Afflicted
[1:22:11] mind
[1:22:13] he sees that he sees the problem in your
[1:22:15] body but he says you know what sister I
[1:22:17] could
[1:22:19] and that's just your body
[1:22:23] and yeah it'll be better but the greater
[1:22:25] healing would be if I could take
[1:22:27] condemnation out of your heart
[1:22:29] the greater healing would be if I could
[1:22:31] help you with all your disappointments
[1:22:32] and all your past experiences that would
[1:22:34] be better because you've interpreted the
[1:22:36] data way incorrectly
[1:22:39] you thought because this happened it
[1:22:40] meant this and you thought because that
[1:22:42] happened it meant this and you've been
[1:22:43] busy trying to interpret the data when
[1:22:44] all I've wanted you to do is just trust
[1:22:46] me
[1:22:47] and don't try to have explanations don't
[1:22:49] ask a bunch of parasitical questions
[1:22:50] don't try to have it all figured out
[1:22:52] don't try to be legalistic this is at
[1:22:54] the end of the day this is what kept
[1:22:55] coming to my mind God is more interested
[1:22:57] in an intimate relationship with you
[1:22:59] than he is how well your body is
[1:23:01] and God will be happy to let you suffer
[1:23:04] a little physical trouble if in the end
[1:23:06] it causes you a deeper fellowship and
[1:23:07] communion with you because that's what
[1:23:09] he wants at the end of the day is deeper
[1:23:11] Fellowship more genuine communion with
[1:23:13] you and sometimes you're just like God
[1:23:15] will you hear my body thanks see you
[1:23:16] later glad I'm well
[1:23:19] it's the heart issue
[1:23:22] that's the very that's what came to my
[1:23:24] mind when the Holy Christ my healer it
[1:23:25] was about healing our hearts that's how
[1:23:27] it originally came to me last year now
[1:23:30] listen to this statement
[1:23:31] and please I just I have just a few
[1:23:34] things here to close on
[1:23:37] at in the sermon at Thy word he's in a
[1:23:39] prayer line
[1:23:40] and his sister comes before him he says
[1:23:42] do you believe I'm God's Prophet that
[1:23:44] he's sent to help you what a question
[1:23:46] how could how ought we to pose that to
[1:23:49] us
[1:23:50] do you believe that I will be able to by
[1:23:52] God know what's wrong with you
[1:23:56] this is so beautiful
[1:23:58] you've had a misunderstood life haven't
[1:24:00] you
[1:24:03] do you believe listen you can look at
[1:24:06] the statement all you you just keep
[1:24:07] looking at the quote but listen
[1:24:10] do you believe God can tell you what's
[1:24:12] wrong with you
[1:24:14] and he says
[1:24:16] you've been misunderstood
[1:24:19] haven't you
[1:24:21] he's wanting to he want to identify
[1:24:23] what's wrong
[1:24:24] many times many heartaches and trials
[1:24:27] you went through
[1:24:30] I see something a dark streak hanging
[1:24:34] down
[1:24:35] a long road behind you
[1:24:38] you've changed now
[1:24:42] listen
[1:24:43] she couldn't
[1:24:45] she couldn't see The Long Dark streak
[1:24:47] but she knew about all the
[1:24:49] misunderstandings she knew all about the
[1:24:51] heartaches she knew all about the trials
[1:24:54] and what was it it was a dark stream
[1:24:56] behind her
[1:24:57] that she carried with her and brother
[1:25:00] banham sees it and God was wanting to
[1:25:02] tell her what was wrong with her what's
[1:25:03] wrong with her is she's way too
[1:25:05] conscious and if you think that I'm just
[1:25:06] embellishing this too much
[1:25:08] this impacts me so deeply that why would
[1:25:11] God expose all her life's
[1:25:13] misunderstandings
[1:25:15] why we'd expose her trials and her
[1:25:17] hardships if it had nothing to do with
[1:25:20] her stomach trouble
[1:25:21] or her ability to receive healing for
[1:25:24] the stomach trouble so he tells her
[1:25:26] you've changed now so that she could
[1:25:29] realize that dark streak's not hers
[1:25:31] anymore
[1:25:33] that all the misunderstandings all the
[1:25:34] hardships all the past that's like a
[1:25:37] dark shadow chasing her he could say
[1:25:38] you've changed that's not you he blocked
[1:25:41] off he damned up the stream he separated
[1:25:43] her out and then he says you're
[1:25:45] suffering with the stomach trouble
[1:25:46] aren't you isn't that right stand on
[1:25:49] your feet and receive your healing in
[1:25:50] the name of the Lord Jesus and be made
[1:25:52] well it wasn't just a gimmick to get her
[1:25:55] to believe that the prophet knew what
[1:25:56] her past was it was God telling her what
[1:26:00] was wrong with her faith in order to
[1:26:01] receive her healing she believed enough
[1:26:03] to stand there and want her healing but
[1:26:06] maybe her condition I'm speculating
[1:26:07] maybe her condition was chronic maybe
[1:26:10] the doctor said you're going to have to
[1:26:11] live with the rest of your life then
[1:26:12] maybe they didn't know what they were
[1:26:13] going to do and she believed for her
[1:26:15] healing but all her misunderstandings
[1:26:18] all her hardships all her trials were
[1:26:20] behind you're like a dark shadow he said
[1:26:22] it's a long road behind you but you've
[1:26:25] changed now
[1:26:27] you've changed now take your faith off
[1:26:30] the dark stream and put it in the
[1:26:32] promise and go and receive your healing
[1:26:35] oh did Jesus not say let not your heart
[1:26:37] be troubled you believe in God believe
[1:26:39] also in me let's not let our hearts be
[1:26:42] the trouble or let not our hearts
[1:26:44] trouble us
[1:26:48] he says if you got perfect love of God
[1:26:50] in your heart you don't question God
[1:26:51] about anything well that seems like to
[1:26:53] be a rebuke
[1:26:55] but it speaks to the problem
[1:26:57] when the Bible said I'm the Lord that
[1:26:59] heals all that he sees as you say Amen
[1:27:01] Lord that's right that's me
[1:27:03] are we not taught that if you had cancer
[1:27:05] and didn't fear
[1:27:07] and believe God would heal you you
[1:27:08] wouldn't be in a bad place
[1:27:10] because it's not the diagnosis that's
[1:27:13] bad
[1:27:14] it's the subsequent fear
[1:27:16] in doubt
[1:27:19] that's where the healing comes first
[1:27:22] God what if God took away some things
[1:27:24] from us but never dealt the underlying
[1:27:26] suspicion and fear and hesitation
[1:27:29] because then the next time something
[1:27:30] happens we're right in the same boat
[1:27:34] I think it's a real beautiful picture
[1:27:36] if we could bow our heads
[1:27:40] the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:27:42] 26
[1:27:44] the spirit helps us in our infirmities
[1:27:47] we know not what we should pray for as
[1:27:49] we ought
[1:27:51] but the spirit will make it a session
[1:27:53] for us
[1:27:58] with groanings
[1:28:00] which cannot be uttered
[1:28:04] James said if you're afflicted
[1:28:08] pray
[1:28:12] he said if you're
[1:28:14] sad
[1:28:16] praise
[1:28:19] that's what I'm going to ask you today
[1:28:22] if you have a chronic condition of your
[1:28:23] heart I'm not talking about your body
[1:28:24] your sickness
[1:28:26] whether it be back pain or stomach pain
[1:28:28] or headaches whatever I'm not talking
[1:28:30] about the physical part I'm talking
[1:28:32] about the Heart part
[1:28:34] if you have a chronic condition of your
[1:28:36] heart
[1:28:39] he's a Healer of the broken heart
[1:28:42] he's a lifter of our heads as the
[1:28:44] scripture says
[1:28:46] Christ My Healer
[1:28:49] it'd even be a greater healing
[1:28:52] to heal your heart
[1:28:57] maybe our prayer we don't even know what
[1:28:59] to pray but the spirit will make
[1:29:00] intercession for us with groanings
[1:29:03] our heads are bowed
[1:29:06] I know sometimes we offer we ask if
[1:29:08] there would be a hand raised or
[1:29:11] or something along those lines
[1:29:17] but the Bible said
[1:29:19] if you're Afflicted pray
[1:29:23] then I'm just going to ask today that if
[1:29:25] there be anybody who has a condition in
[1:29:26] their heart
[1:29:28] pray
[1:29:29] [Music]
