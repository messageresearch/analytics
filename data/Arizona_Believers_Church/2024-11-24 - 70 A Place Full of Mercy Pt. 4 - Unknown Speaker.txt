TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continuing on the subject of a Place full of Mercy this is part four I'm hoping just to wrap up this portion today Lord willing on Sunday when we pick up I'd like to maybe get into the voice of Mercy that's my working title for the next four services but today A Place full of mercy and I'm looking at it from the standpoint of how brother brandom uses this exact phrase judgment is striking and so judgment is striking even uh is very particular about certain events that were transpiring that was showing judgment that was striking and he said judgment is at hand and there's a lot of uh significant aspects of judgment and this finality of things and the tribulation that's coming on uh we know that the bride will not suffer tribulation but yet there can be judgment that's falling upon Nations and upon people and during this terrible time that we're living in and where we could see scriptural things taking place that would cause us to pause and wonder well what does this mean for our loved ones what does this mean for Sinners even cause a prophet to preach could it be that no one can be saved now uh we realize that that's because of the significance of the events that had transpired that year when he preaches Souls that are in prison now and we realize that though this judgment is striking and we're living in a time of judgment yet there is still mercy and I believe that with all of my heart and I would ask today as you normally do just uh Focus I know we all May have turkey on our mind and all the events of this coming week but Focus because I'm going to use a lot of scripture and I hope that you can absorb it and that you could make the connections in your heart or ask God to make these connections for you there's a lot of scriptures I'd like to read where normally what I think I would do or want to do is take that scripture and then add in other scriptures to support that and statements from the message of the hour to where you know in that self maybe it would just be a but I want to read a lot scripture today to where I'm hoping that you in your hearts could uh consider are these things that are taking place in the day and age we're living in now are these things transpiring now and uh so instead of maybe building it out as I would normally like to I'm just going to cover a lot of scripture and hope that God Can Make It Real to you in Romans chapter 3: 22-2 I'm just hitting rewind a little bit to cover a little bit from Wednesday and Paul says even the righteous of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe so there he must have faith he says for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God hath set forth so Jesus Christ has been set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbear erance of God as Paul typically does that's a mouthful but the part I'm wanting just to ex Express or zero in on is that God has declared Jesus Christ as The Mercy Seat now in the temple in the Tabernacle there was a place in the most holy place the holiest of holies and there the presence of God dwelt between the cherubims which is that plate that lid of perpetuation that was set upon the ark the ark containing certain instruments um and things inside of it and all of it together represents this Dwelling Place of God the Tabernacle the secret place and this lid of perpetuation which is called The Mercy Seat made of gold and overlaid over wood this he says now is Christ has been set forth and declared to be The Mercy Seat the place of reconciliation the place that we find God's presence the place that we find Mercy and this Mercy that he is set forth to be declared we can say that Mercy came in the form of Jesus Christ as God showing Mercy offered Jesus Christ as a substitute we've said this the last few Services what a paradox we were subject to judgment God showed us Mercy by having his son put to death and it wouldn't seem to be too merciful to Christ but yet he has set forth as our atonement and our substitute so Christ is The Mercy Seat then in first Timothy chap 1 I want to read these two verses 13 and 16 Paul speaking of himself said who was before who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injures this is Paul the chief chiefest of Sinners he was a blasphemer a persecutor inous he was a murderer but I obtained Mercy it's a phrase that's used in the New Testament obtaining Mercy I want uh to say this if I haven't emphasized it yet very clearly that this Mercy that you obtain isn't necessarily incidental nor is it something that comes and goes you've obtained it you're the beneficiary of it it's done you've got it you are the bear you are the recipient you've obtained mercy and you can't lose it so for this cause have I he says I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief it's quite a statement I obtained Mercy because in my ignorance I did these things and it's this image then of him being ignorant in unbelief and that's uh I think that's critical to think about what unbelief is and so Paul was in unbelief but yet he obtained mercy so in his ignorance through unbelief but yet he did these things but now he's obtained mercy and he comes to verse 16 he says how be it for this cause I obtained mercy so Paul is not just saying well I got Mercy because I was ignorant he said but God wanted to do something he says that in me first Christ Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should believe Hereafter to them which should Hereafter believe on him to everlasting life I sinned in ignorance but I obtained mercy and God wanted to declare through my testimony and my experience how that he would show longsuffering and he would Grant mercy and give Mercy to them who also believe despite their ignorance and despite their sin so God used Paul and is using Paul as an example of how Mercy works and how Mercy work going from ignorance to truth that if there's a truth if there's a reality you disbelieved it or you didn't know it you sinned you were doing contrary to the word of God and we could say in the strictest sense that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God therefore being subject to the penalty of sin which is death then we're all guilty but Mercy covers that guilt and mercy it says wow you are were now that you have believed I exempt you now that you have believed upon the perpetuation Christ then you obtain mercy so it's a great example to us and he says he did it ignorantly in unbelief these things that he did and in James 4:1 17 says therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin to him that knows to do good and doesn't do it to him it is sin something to think about for ourselves sometimes we look at somebody say Well they're nothing but a sinner because they're doing something that you know they shouldn't do but to them that sin that knows to do good and doesn't do it to him it is sin so sin is knowing and not doing therefore we could say sin is unbelief because anything the Bible says anything that is not of faith is sin all unrighteousness is sin so we see these things in the scripture and that to disbelieve the word of God unbelief is sin and these other things are attributes of sin and brother brandham when we were looking at these things on Wednesday he speaks of how when truth is presented to a person for the last time and the refuse to receive it they are finished and this is this is the thought of if truth is presented then you're no longer ignorant then you just choose to not believe or accept what the truth is telling you or you just willfully choose not to obey the truth and it says when a person does that for the last time then they're finished there can be no more Mercy to someone who refuses truth and I hope that's been clear in scripture how that mercy and Truth are met together in our atonement and mercy and Truth are met together in Christ Jesus so you reject Christ not only you're rejecting truth you're rejecting mercy so we're wanting to continue along these lines how that Mercy is available despite judgment but it's only found in one place just because there's Mercy doesn't mean you're going to be able to find it willy-nilly but Mercy is found in one place and I can say even if Mercy is over in one sense or in one place there can still be Mercy in another place just as The Mercy Seat moved in the Old Testament and as the Mercy Seat was declared to be vacant in the Tabernacle that day or in the temple that day and hanging upon a cross the same can be so where God declares that a system is over dispensation is over and now you've got to come to God's provided place to find his Mercy now this these next several scriptures we're going to use and I think for the most part most of the scriptures we use will track along these lines is showing how that God in a time of judgment there's still this aspect of Mercy in Psalm 76 : 7 to2 says Thou even Thou Art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when Once Thou Art angry now this is about God thou didst cause judgment to be heard from Heaven the Earth feared and was still when God arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth say law so now there's this declaration of how fearful it is when God is angry that he causes judgment to be heard from heaven so there's this voice that comes down and the Earth fears and then it's still it it obeys the voice of God so God when God arises to judgment when God arose to judgment now think of these terms he's arising to judge to save so it's just it's right there in the same sentence when God arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth verse 10 surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of Wrath shall Thou shalt wrath shalt thou restrain so there's wrath there's judgment the remainder there's some restraint so he comes to judge but yet save vow and pay unto the Lord your God let all that be round about him bring presence unto him that ought to be feared he shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the kings of the Earth or as we like to say he's turble to the kings of the earth so we could look at this scripture that God in a time of judgment as God Rises to judge he's also through his judgment going to save the meek of the Earth so despite his wrath God will have mercy on his people and they will praise him that's what the scripture saying he's angry he's coming to to to judge but he will have mercy on his people therefore they will give this vow of praise and they will offer praise if I could say this they may be uh deserving of Wrath but they're not appointed to it they may be guilty of sin and all of sin and fallen short of the glory of God but he has not destined them to wrath job looked at it this way job 14:13 oh thou would that thou would has hided me in the grave thou wouldest that thou wouldest Keep Me In Secret this is the the Declaration of a an Earthly man a carnal man he says hide me in the grave or keep me in secret until thy wrath be passed amen so there's wrath and there's this judgment the things are coming well hide me secure me keep me from your wrath that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me I what a great statement and say well if your judgment's coming and there's going to be a judgment would you just hide me in a secret place would you appoint me a special time where you would remember me that if you would hide me keep me from your wrath but don't forget me Appo A Time To Remember Me In Isaiah 121:2 it says and in that day Thou shalt say oh Lord I will praise thee though thou was angry with me thy anger is turned away and thou comforted this me what a what a difference in Anger to comfort and remember this phrase he's angry but I received Comfort he there was this wrath there was this indignation there he God arose to judgment but he saved the meek of the earth you were angry but your angers turned away and you comforted me behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation he is our Salvation we're not just saved but he by him but he is our Salvation this even speaks to the Salvation that's going to be revealed in the end time the revelation of Jesus Christ that comes a and is that Capstone this is he has become our Salvation this grace that is brought to us this salvation to be revealed in the end he's angry but it's turned away and his despite the anger it's Comfort the Bible says this in Isaiah 34 and then also later in chapter 63 Isaiah 348 for it is the day of the Lord's Vengeance that's a wrathful time it's a terrible time it's a uh tempestuous and it's fiery flames of judgment and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion so a day of the Lord's Vengeance and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion if we were to drill down on this in great depth it's God liberating Zion of her enemies God silencing her critics for this controversy of Zion the dispute The Strife of Zion there's going to be a reward for The Strife of Zion in this day of Vengeance we could look at this scripture day of Vengeance a year of recompense it's judgment for some reward for others this year of recompenses we can say that in this time of judgment this day of the Lord's Vengeance it's punishment and Dread for one group of people but Vindication and glory for another it says it this way in Isaiah 6 3:4 for the day of vengeance is in Mine Heart it's in his heart it's day of Vengeance the time has come it's time for wrath time for judgment time for separation time to uh to take those that are going to be judged and gather them together and the year of my redeemed is come now that's quite uh it's quite a combination of things the day of Vengeance the day of Judgment Day of Wrath but then at the same time the year of my redeemed has come the year of my redeemed this time of perfection it's a time of fullness a time of completion to be redeemed it's it's this fullness to recompense as it read earlier it means to reward those that are in this Covenant of Peace means to be at peace means to complete or finish to recompense to finish to complete it speaks of a covenant of peace to plate to reward judgments being pronounced and Redemption is being finished I want you to catch this in the scripture how that it's a day of vengeance so judgment is being pronounced judgment is at hand but Redemption is being completed God is bringing Full Redemption and so we could say if God's bringing Full Redemption there's no more Hal truth there's nothing in part there's nothing missing there's no excuses God has paid the price of redemption now God is completing and finishing Redemption it's a time of full Redemption and instead of looking at it maybe this way well God's judging so there's protection for these look at it this way God is bringing the fullness of redemption God is going to complete his cycle God is going to finish up everything that he started and so in the finality that's where you need to be because if you're not there you're left out of his Plan of Redemption and it not being in his Plan of Redemption all that's left for you is Judgment so it's not that judgment is necessarily his goal or his focus in that moment well I'm just going to come to judge and you guys just sit still while I judge everybody it's more that I've come to f finish my Redemption and in finishing my Redemption you must be a part of this or you're going to be left out of redemption amen so it's a special uh special dispensation and if it's a time for full Redemption it's redeeming time it's a it's time for Redemption then there's a an end of mediating it's an there's an end to interceding now I know those are phrases that get people thinking oh boy where is he going well you'll know soon enough not going anywhere other than where I believe the prophet taught so there's just I don't think there's any reason to get weird with it but we do need to look at these things with some serious consideration the day of Vengeance day of Wrath a day of judgment but a day of redemption the fullness of redemption it's redeeming time it's a complete of redemption in Psalms 102 I like to read verses 1 to verse 20 I wanted I thought about chopping this in half but I thought if we just read through this whole thing we'll get the full picture of this groaning and this crying out from the heart of this Afflicted a prayer of The Afflicted who is overwhelmed and porth out his complaint before the Lord hear my prayer O Lord and let me cry Let My Cry come unto thee in the cry in The Exodus God said that I am come down for the cries of my people reached un heaven and I've come down to deliver them here yet again a cry is offered up to heaven hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when I call answer me speedily come to my defense come to my Aid and Jesus when he gives the parable of the unrighteous judge who avenged the Widow who wearied him he says I will avenge the elect speedily but will I find faith in that time is his question for my days are consumed like smoke and my my bones are burned as a hear my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I forget to eat my bread I know what that's like my reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin I'm like a pelican of the Wilderness I'm like an owl of the desert I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the Housetop my enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against me my enemies Compass themselves round about me for I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping because of thine indignation and thine wrath for thou Hast Lifted Me Up and cast me down my days are like a shadow that Decline and I'm withered like grass though there's the Lamentations but thou oh Lord shalt endure forever in thy remembrance unto all generations Thou shalt arise remember as the Bible said in Psalm it says when God arose to judgment he's rising to judge he's going going to have wrath to cut the spirit of the princes he's going to be terrible to the kings of the earth he's going to pour out his judgment he's going to pour out his wrath but Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her yay the set time has come it's even akin to the prayer of job we said oh that you would just hide me in this time of trouble and appoint a time where you'll show me favor that thou wouldest remember me he says I will arise and have mercy for the time to show her grace yay the set time to favor her is come for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof she is in shambles she is torn down she has been laid in Ruins when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory think of this great image of the the bride being built up the bride will come in preview again the Lord shall build up Zion brother Brandon Place said in one place Zion is the bride there's this spiritual image of the Bride the New Jerusalem and God is going to restore her he's going to build her up and when he does he's going to appear in his glory and the woman is the glory of the man the bride is the glory of the son of man he's going to appear in his glory when he she he builds up Zion when the time comes to have mercy on Zion he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord this is that Gentile how bride the New Creations a new race a super race a super people and this time when he builds up Zion and he appears in his glory for Heath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death what tremendous Prophecy of the end time that he has looked down from the heights of Heaven and the Lord himself will descend and he puts one foot on land one foot on sea and he's making a declaration to Lo those that are appointed to death he hears the groaning of the prisoners Paul said we who are in this body do grown wanting to be what liberated he'll hear the groaning of the prisoner and loose those that are appointed to death so it's not that we don't deserve death it's not that we don't deserve wrath but we're not appointed to it in Hebrews 927 and 28 as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this judgment you can say that's that's the general rule it's appointed a men once to die but after this judgment we know that we say there's two things that are certain death and taxes well guess what some don't pay taxes so there's two things that are certain death and judgment but I like to throw that in there because it says so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many why because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God so as it is appointed unto men once to die and then after that judgment Christ Christ was offered to Bear the sins of many that they would no longer face judgment but they passed from Death un life and would not come into the Judgment that's what the atonement was for he says and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation it's a prophecy of him coming in the end time that Christ came one time and paid the price the atonement to Bear the sins of many and because of that you will not come into judgment but yet there's still disappointment with death and so to them that look for him shall he appear the second time not to address sin which makes us subject to judgment but for salvation from Death Or if I could say this the Salvation to be revealed in the end to cause us to triumph over even death itself to loose those appointed to death to cancel a people's appointment with the grave right cuz we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed there will be those who are able to place death under their feet this is the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death you may be deserving of death but you're not appointed to it in Isaiah chapter 61: 1 to3 as we're looking at how that the Lord shall arise and have mercy on Zion in Isaiah chapter 61: 1-3 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath appointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek Heath sent me to bind up the broken hearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord we realize that Jesus when he entered into the temple he found where it was written of him in the gospel of Isa the letter the book of of Isaiah and he read to this very portion and he stopped and stopping to read brother bam takes some great uh goes to Great Links to show that this next part did not pertain to this coming that he was in in the Book of Luke so he did not read those things but he said he stopped said this day this scripture is fulfilled it's fulfilled in your ears you're seeing it now before your eyes this day this scripture is fulfilled but the very next part in verse three is to Appo or excuse me the next part after the common not verse three yet but here in verse two to proclaim the accept of the year of the Lord comma think about how many days passed just because of this one comma and the day of Vengeance of our God remember these other scriptures that speak of this day of Vengeance this time of wrath for it is the day of the Lord's Vengeance for the day of vengeance is in my heart but in each time it said in the year of recompense and the year of my redeemed is come so it is a day of Vengeance of our God and this day of Vengeance to comfort all that mourn doesn't seem likely that Vengeance would result in Comfort but rather this is exactly what happens CU God arises for judgment to save the meek there seemed that his wrath was going to be poured out but at that same time God in this time is going to comfort them that mourn in Zion to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them so here's the new appointment Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of Heaven is that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified this is a new appointment He's going to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion Beauty for Ashes oil of joy for mour a Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness Trees of Righteousness this is at the very time that the day of Vengeance of our God is at hand there's something else taking place if you're often looking for Direction what to listen to or what to study uh in the coming year in 2025 listen to the series of sermons that brother BR preached in Arizona in January I think it was in Tucson Phoenix and even Flagstaff and in particular to this point in birth pains which he is I think it's January 24th he preaches birth pains and something significant happens at the beginning of that then the next day he preaches this day this scripture is fulfilled and he starts connecting a lot of scriptures and he starts saying saying this day this scripture is fulfilled and he shows the significance of how the scroll was handed to Christ and he read up to this part in the scripture and then stopped and then when he preaches birth pains a priest hands him the Bible and he reads the scripture and brother brandham is bringing us to this place and I'll just have you go listen to where he's stopping and orienting us right here to Isaiah 61 this day of Vengeance of our God but a day of the redeemed a day of comforting so listen to those two if you'd like God arose to judgment but in judging he saved the meek in Psalms 50: 1 to6 the Mighty God even the Lord hath spoken and called the Earth from the rising of the sun un the going down thereof out of Zion think of the Bride in this instance the Perfection of beauty God hath shined her light is going to shine she's going to be in her fullness and full Glory out of the out of Zion the Perfection of beauty God hath shined Our God shall come and shall not keep silence this is the the Lord arising the Lord appearing there's this special dispensation Our God shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempet tuous round about him it's going to be as a a pillar of fire it's going to be Authority it's going to be manifesting itself as a judge fire going to devour before and very tempet tuous round about him it declar him to be one who's coming to judge in this fierceness of his wrath he shall call to the heavens from above and to the Earth so here he's calling to the heavens above he's on Earth he's judging that he may judge his people now he's going to judge the scripture even says in Psalms among the gods how long will you accept the wicked among the righteous it speaks of now there's a judgment time that he may judge his people now does the bride go through Jud judgement the answer is no she doesn't go to White Throne judgment and you're like yeah you got to be more precise lawyer uh she doesn't go to White Throne judgment she takes her judgment here she judged by the word and she lines up with it she does not have to go through the tribulation to be purged but yet here he stands judging his people so he says gather my Saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for God is Judge himself God declaring himself as a judge supreme authority the heaven shall declare his righteousness for God is Judge himself say law these are God's characteristics in a time of judgment tempestuous fire devouring before him God is judged a judge and at this time when he is revealed himself as a supreme authority as he's revealed himself as a judge as he's declaring that judgment is at hand he also gathers his people now I'll come to it here in a moment he's Gathering them not to pour out his wrath upon them God's coming gather and because he's coming gather because in this day of Vengeance of our God is a byproduct of the fullness of redemption that when God goes ahead and he's he's finishing up his Redemption process when God is coming to the fullness of redemption then there's a consequence for those who are not a part of it so verse 16 and 17 but unto the wicked God sayith so he's coming as a judge and as he comes as this judge he gathers his people and says but under the wicked God saith so there's a consequence to those who are wicked what hast thou to do to declare my statutes or what or that thou should us take my Covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and castest my words behind thee wow what an indictment to the wicked what do you have to declare my statutes why do you put my words in your mouth why do you take my Covenant with your lips when you hate what my Commandments are and you cast the word behind you you draw nigh unto me with your mouth but your heart is far from my word they've rejected the word the wicked have rejected the word so they're subject to his judgments they're under the threat of of the wrath of this one who is tempet tuous who Goes Forth as a devouring flame they're under the threat of burning and because they're under the threat of judgment they can't be his voice because they have rejected his word you hate my instructions you cast my words behind thee so how can you put my words in your mouth you cannot be my mouthpiece therefore there's nothing left but judgment for those who reject the word as we like to say when we protest no truth no mercy in Malachi 3: 16-18 we're seeing these aspects of Mercy is there in a time of judgment it's connected with Redemption it's connected with the truth Malachi chter 3 verses 161 17 and 18 then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name job even saying oh if thou wouldest hide me in secret and then appoint a time that you would remember me as it were even if it was opening up a book and reading the name and saying I've remembered you job because you're in my book of remembrance and it says in verse 17 and they shall be mine sayith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my Jewels a woman is a jewel she is a crown this would has a great symbolism of a bride in the day that I make up my Jewels I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not I will spare them those that that that I make up that I'm calling my Jewels I will they shall be mine in that day when I make up my Jewels my crowning I will spare them in a day of judgment and a day of Wrath I will have mercy on them I will favor her amen as a father would favor his son that serves him as a father would show mercy and Grace to a son who's obedient to him I will favor her in the same way that the father honored the son and declared himself with him and Jesus said my father has given me power to lay down my life and to take it up again it this was the favor of God to his son and this is the preface to Malachi chapter 4 Malachi chapter 3 I'm not just doing the math but I'm wanting you to recognize Malachi chapter 4 this great and terrible day of the Lord this day when the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings and the bride will go forth as growing up and arise as those that have been fed properly coming to their maturity and their completion this is God's plan for his elect before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it's during this time that he's Gathering gather my Saints together unto me in that day that I make up my Jewels it's the time that he gathers Nations and he assembles kingdoms what he's doing is he's separating out the elect for a rapture amen and the rest are subject to tribulation it's a binding for wrath it's a binding for burning and realizing now that I may have removed some scriptures here where brother where the scripture speaks of a gathering together it may be a little bit later but as I was trimming some things I might have left out a couple scriptures but notice this he speaks in the scripture of gathering Nations and kingdoms together in Matthew 13:40 as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of the world and brother brandham said it is binding time now and he says and they are bundling now there's something happened in the spiritual realm I know that we want me me why we may want to look at literal bindings and and see things happening and they're putting all all the Believers on railroad cars to Alaska and and we're being shipped off to one place we're all moving to Jeffersonville and and so we're all we're all being gathered together in some place and then the rest is all collecting together to persecute the bride and we're maybe looking for more literal things but brother BR I'm spiritually identified the foolish virgin he spiritually identified The Binding Together the tears and in the days of his ministry it was binding them it was binding then he says it's binding time now they're bundling now he writes in the church age book the Leo Dean age is the Harvest Time of gathering the tears for binding and burning that's taking place in this time in this age and the Gathering the wheat for the Lord so there's a gathering together of the elect there's a gather my people to me the Lord's going to arise for the purpose of judgment fire is going to be devouring round about him he's going to reveal himself as the supreme authority he's going to declare himself as the wigged one he is going to set one foot on land and one foot on sea and books are going to be open or the book is going to be open God's going to judge but it's not just judgment in the sense of condemnation but it's the fullness of redemption during that time because it's the Gathering of the wheat for the Lord listen to these statements these are just two of many that we could read in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals he's talking about John getting all happy and shouting and declaring wonderful things talk about a happy time when the seals broke he asked why why was it at a happy time when the Revelation come that the lamb the Redeemer are Kinsmen so there he is Kinsmen Redeemer this is redemption had come back from the Throne of mediatorial and had walked out there to take his possession now think of some of the elements of the message of the hour that there's a message that goes forth to gather the elect there there there is a a message the living bread of life that brings forth the bride this is redemption claims cuz he says he leaves the Throne of mediation to take his possession in the day when I make up my jewels and the day when I gather my people to myself he says a little bit later in the same sermon the seals were broke why you ask a question again for us this is good the seals are broke in the last Church age to reveal these truths why so the seals are broke why to reveal these truths why were these truths revealed the lamb broke the seals and reveal them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride he wants to bring his subjects to him now and the language that brother Bam's using in the breach is he's making claim his claim for Redemption these are Redemption claims so at the very time that the lamb in symbolism form is leaving this mercy seat and leaves this place of intercession IM mediation he's coming forward at the time that that happens he's making Redemption claims now this is the fullness of redemption Spirit of the truth the spirit of truth calling the elect to the full word out of traditions for what purpose fullness of redemption not another church age cycle not religion not tradition but for Redemption I believe these things are important for us to ponder amen I think it's important for us to consider these things in light of brother Brandon preaching the Seven Seals Souls that are in prison now Christ is a mystery of God revealed someone pointed out that I had the wrong date on that sermon Christ mystery of God revealed in the slide and it was like hey once it's out there I can't really fix that I guess I could try to go in and edit it the film I need some brothers who are really good at film we can edit the edit the tape online but it's there I made a typo but these things are important for us to consider why brother R used the language that he did why he emphasized the things that he did and I believe that there's an end time well these scriptures that we're using as this Mercy in time of judgment these things we face right now and if we could let's look at the text that we took and again I'm just going to read through these things maybe quickly I hope brother Alfonso's able to catch his breath but in Matthew chapter 9: 11-13 it says and when Pharisees saw it because what is he doing he's eating with these publicans and sinners so look at this guy look at this teacher look at this guy hanging out with the Sinners hanging out with the publicans not Republicans publicans I think it's uh I think the saying is God God is not a Christian is I think what one person sometimes they say well I think there's some logic to that but Jesus is not a republican we could say that but it says that he why does your master eat with publicans and sinners your Rabbi your master your teacher to these disciples these Jews who it would appear that on the face and on the surface they're they're not honoring the the law they're not honoring what God would command of them why does he eat with publicans and Sinners and when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick so if someone is completely healthy they don't need a doctor but if you're sick you need a doctor so I think that statement in a lot of ways speaks for itself that he's implying that they are in need of me they are in need of the physician the great physician and then he challenges them with this but you go and learn what this means but go ye and learn what that mean go and learn what this phrase means this scripture I will have mercy and not sacrifice he's asking the Pharisees to consider go back study see if you can figure this out I will have mercy and not sacrifice and he says of himself for I not come to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance the righteous here I know for a long time I viewed it in the sense that there is a day and there's a time when he does call the righteous and maybe just in some type he's going to call the righteous his bride the elect and and not the sinner necessarily but there's this other component to Redemption but here I believe as I've studied this more that there is this component of a rebuke to the Pharisees the righteous the Pharisees the those that are in that traditional system of self-righteousness who made sure everything looked good on the outside and he says well the sick need a physician and you guys think you're fine and and you've whitewashed your tombs and everything looks really really good on the outside but I didn't come for the righteous I came for the Sinners and to call them to repentance so it wasn't that I'm just there to hang out with publicans and sinners because they cook the best and they have the best wine or these are the things this is where the they're they're fun to hang out with and you guys are just sticks in the mud but rather he's saying I'm not just here for the purpose of hanging out and eating with them but I want to call Sinners to repentance and if I could because I feel like this might just be out there uh waiting for more uh uh more emphasis in the word of God but I want us to think about your place today there was this system of self-righteousness there was these collection of Pharisees and Sadducees and these scribes and this tradition that they had built around the law of God and around a true God and true religion and they had this form of worship that God had accepted but there they were so caught up in their Traditions it was blinding them to God fulfilling his promised word right before them and he said the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and he called men to repent and there is this great transition or this Exodus in this second Exodus he's there speaking to them and he's condemning the system because he knows that there's going to be judgment on that system and they've got to come into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's saying I've got to call them to repentance and I'd like for us to consider where we sit today and what our part is today our place today as he said I will have mercy and not sacrifice sacrifice was the main part of their ceremonial law you do away the sacrifices and offerings you're not left with much and he says this sacrifice and how substantial it would be to them I will have mercy and not sacrifice in other words I love Mercy more than sacrifice the law could keep be kept ceremonially surfly it could be kept externally as a tradition and in doing so Jesus Calls the phes Hypocrites CU he says that they are able to give pretense outwardly but still inwardly be Wicked so their religion was a covering it was man-made they had made the word of God of no effect through tradition they weren't catching the heart of what the law was pointing to Paul goes to Great Lengths in Romans and Hebrews to point out that these things were all pointing to Christ these things were foreshadowing it wasn't the better Covenant they spoke of a more perfect Covenant we spent a lot of time in this series on the house of the Lord dealing with the Pharisees and their hypocrisy and their pretense Matthew 23:23 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and Anis and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law they were very precise and detailed in these surface things and these things that could be measured out precisely well how long is this and and how is this working but then he said there's the weigher matters of the law which is Judgment mercy and faith and here again it's connected together judgment mercy and truth faith Fidelity these are the weigher matters of the law and lest you misunderstand what Christ is saying he says these ought ye to have done you ought to do judgment mercy and Faith but not leave the other undone so do the tithe of men nanis and cumin but don't omit judgment mercy and Faith so when he ask go learn what was meant I will have mercy and not sacrifice he's wanting them in in their religious system in their order of worship and their Viewpoint of the law to think about what was at the heart of it what's that my heart what is it you're supposed to get out of out of the law that I'm just this ruthless Taskmaster who's ordered all these things for you to obey and that if you obey them perfectly then I will just look past your sin it means something I was going to save this for uh next Sunday but I'll just read the whole portion I just going to read verse 6 but I want to read the whole portion and I want to say this as we read this this day this scripture is being fulfilled Come and Let Us return unto the Lord and Malachi says then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked Malachi chapter four speaks of Elijah coming in the end time to turn us back to the Lord come let us return unto the Lord for Heth torn and he will heal us Heath smitten and he will bind us up some great truths contained in that after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight or in his presence going to be a raising up of the Bride in the third day listen there's no stumbling that were there in the year 2000s right there's no no stumbling that we've entered into this third day because we are it is in this time that the bride is going to come to a completion to the fullness of redemption after two days he will revive us he will life will be coming into into the body he will raise us up and we're going to live in his presence speaking of this great hour when we return to the Lord then shall we know when that which is perfect is come then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning it is the rising of the Sun and he shall come unto us as the rain as a latter and former rain unto the Earth teaching and harvest Reign together he says oh Ephraim what shall I do unto thee Oh Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness your mercy is the word there you it's translated to merciful this is of Ephraim and Judah is as a morning cloud and as the early do it goeth away it it it's not remaining what am I going to do with you therefore I've hewed them by the prophets I've slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth for I desired mercy your Mercy's run out you don't even you're not showing Mercy you may keep sacrifices you you you may do all these external things but I'm going to judge I've slain my judgments go forth for I have I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings notice this together com Let Us return to the Lord that we may know him and that when we know him when we follow on to know the Lord this Lord who's going forth is prepared as the morning who's going to come to us as the former and latter rign upon the Earth in that day he will heal us he will revive us he will restore to us he will build us up for he desired mercy and the knowledge of God more than sacrifice and burnt offerings but they like men have transgressed the Covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me come let us return unto the Lord your mercy Runs Out Ephraim and Judah therefore I've cut them by the prophets I've slain them by my words of my mouth my judgments go forth as the light that goes forth and he says I desired Mercy in the knowledge of me I didn't want just sacrifice and burnt offerings to obey is better than sacrifice the knowledge of the Lord that is right that's what you should be Desiring amen so he's declaring come come let us return though I've smitten you though I've torn you I want to heal you I want to bind you up so the son of righteousness arises with healing in his wings God arises to judge his people he comes comes to save the meek he comes to comfort those that mourn it's a time of appointment it's in that time that God is saying now you must know me for who I am and all that I am and this is what I want I don't want sacrifice I don't want just offerings I want mercy and I want the knowledge of me I want you to know me at my core who I am in my heart I want the full word to be made known to you I want you to understand my plan in my heart I want you to know the secret in the back part of my mind amen in Acts chap 17:30 Paul speaking to them there in Athens who Mars Hill who were worshiping the unknown God and he says and at and the times of this ignorance God winked at when you were ignorantly worshiping he has sent forth Jesus Christ this repuation his son into the world who's died and rose again and he speaks of the Resurrection he says there was a time when you were ignorant of this true God there there was a time when you didn't even know he sent his son there was a time when you didn't know there was a more excellent way there was a time when you did not know these things and at the time of your ignorance God winked at what does that mean God looked past it God was longsuffering he was forbearing if anything it was for it was the god's forbearance in Christ even that atonement that sacrifice God was longsuffering for all those who believed not but now that he's come He commands men everywhere to repent but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent Christ came to call Sinners to repentance and there's an application of this scripture at the time that we're living in now where the church ages God and brother bam is is plain about this God through the work of intercession through Christ the mediator the atonement he winked at ignorance brother writes this in the church age book chapter 10 and that very same spirit and Doctrine is Right amongst all Protestants and it is called denomination nanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby deposing the spirit bism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible and right to this hour many of God's people are caught in the snare of denominationalism catch this many of God's people people are caught God's people I'm going to gather my people going to make up my Jewels I I I I I I'll come in this time when I want to I'm going to come to take my people but they're caught up in the snare of denominationalism and God is crying to them come out of her my people lest you be partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues they're in the denominations they're in the systems they're in bism they're nanism they're in these isms you see they are ignorant and he says but if the Rapture should take place at this moment ignorance would be no court of appeal from the Judgment of God for being in the wrong ranks God's people at one time they they occupied well maybe I'm maybe I'm making a statement that I hope speaking to mature message Believers and you all are taught well this isn't just I know I'm not just scattering this out to people who've never uh seen these things for themselves in the scripture but there's godly people in all organizations and denominations that God was people were receiving births and coming through these systems we even recognize that God was using Church age Messengers who didn't have a full understanding of the godhead others that didn't fully understand this what was that God's mercy that there was this perpetuation there was this testimony that met the mark that stood there covering and God would have people in these organizations but there comes a time when God finally says he sends a voice and come out of her my people and he gathers them because God is wanting to finish up Redemption and you can't stay there anymore you've got to come out in order to go and if you remain you're going to be subject to judgment he says the Rapture could take place and you couldn't say well I didn't know because he says now ignorance is no longer an excuse when he's preaching Revelation 4 part 3 in 1961 in the revelation of Jesus Christ series as far as three Gods that's from hell there's one God that's exactly right now do you say then do you believe that all these people that are trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they are Christians but the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong what hour was approaching what could it be that would come after 1961 that would actually be a time when God would say enough's enough there's no more excuse the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong they're ignorant but there's a time of ignorance where God will no longer wink but command to repent now we might like to think well Mercy Mercy's not over I could keep doing wrong and there's still Mercy but the dispensation that's over is that you can't claim ignorance anymore you've got to line up with the word of God Revelations 3:14 to20 and under the angel of the Church of Le Deans WR these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God do you realize the ministry of brother bradam fulfilled so many different scriptures the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 the seventh angel to the Church of leod Deans a son of man revealing these son of man the Elijah of Malachi 45 and brother brandham even says in about about Revelations 55 that that lamb who took the book immediately comes to Revelations [Music] 10:7 think of these things write these things sayith amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth judgment separation because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now notice this because you're ignorant I counsel thee God at one time looked past this ignorance God at one time knew that they were wretched and Afflicted and miserable and poor and blind and naked yet thought differently about themselves but he says because you're ignorant I will counsel thee and with this counsel you're going to be accountable you can no longer claim ignorance ignorance will not be in the court of appeal from this judgment I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of it and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with is have that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent repent these are the words to leod deia this age of the Harvest Time of gathering tears for binding and burning and the Gathering in the wheat for the Lord so wherein do we find the transition of those who remained blind and miserable and those that are going to take his counsel behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me learn the saying what does it mean I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I love Mercy more than sacrifice I desired Mercy not sacrifice I desired the knowledge of God greater than burnt offerings it's the question that he asked when he's being chastised for who he is sitting down with and eating I counsel thee to buy of me I counsel thee to take of me behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door if you will turn to me if you will repent I will come into him and will s with him and he with me brother bam uses this language in the places he preaches the power to transform and God's power of transformation or the power of transformation and God's power to transform in this deformity chaos that we're in God has sent his transforming power his word Vindicated proven to bring you out of this religious deformity of ignorance that you're walking in naked blind miserable and don't know it this is the time that we're living in I would I would say especially as my heart's overwhelmed with the thought of the voice of Mercy this is why we really need to be accurate reflections of the message of the hour otherwise we're no different than the Pharisees who looked at Jesus Christ sitting down with the publicans and Sinners and judging well light can't have fellowship with darkness and far be it for me to do this and do that and we completely missed that Christ was there as an act of Mercy not as an act of compromise not an act of plating and watering down but it was an act of Mercy they are sick they need mercy and there's so many that sit back in this end time with their folded Revelations 3:17 Revelations 3:17 and they're calling for God's Wrath and God's judgment but who are those that are on Earth at this time who are recognizing that judgment is going to strike and we don't want people to be lost and that we were ignorant ourselves at one time but God sent his transforming power Revelations 18:4 the Elijah turning our hearts to what take us out of the deformity of ignorance am we had to come out of ignorance why because ignorance is no longer being weaked at brother Brandon brings this deformity of ignorance right down to Revelations 3 naked blind miserable and don't know it in the sermon the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals brother Brown speaking of the Lamb he says where did it come from it come from the father's Throne where he was seated since he had been slain and raised again now in this image and this visual as brother bram's dramatizing it and taking these this happening this scriptural happening he's looking at in these terms of behold the line of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to take the book and loose the seals thereof and John turns and looks and he sees a lamb as it had been slain and the lamb which had been slain went to the father and took the book it's this it paints this picture that Christ who had been raised up seated at the right hand of the father as an interceder there's only one uh intercessor between God and man the man Christ Jesus whoever liveth to make mediation to intercede so he's in this office he's in this place but now he's moving something's transpiring and he comes to take the book brother man says where did he come from it's the lamb who come from the father's Throne where he'd been seated and raised up and sat on the right hand of God brother bam says ever living to make intercessions amen raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession notice how he describes it upon the ignorance of the people now I know that it's it's 11:33 on my watch and this is a lot to think about this is the language that brother bradam uses he describes this place of intercession this place of mediation that he's there making intercession upon the ignorance of the people so it's a parallel of the same gospel that Paul preached at the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent as Paul even said they without us could not be made perfect we realize too through the church ages God's foreshadowing this coming of a Perfect Bride the bride being the Capstone they without us could not be made perfect and here we see a similar declaration that the lamb is there interceding he is a mediator his mediatorial work is making intercession upon the ignorance of the people now catch this this is very this is uh I I I I want to say it with some Authority and and and be very definitive but I I'll say it for you to think about that when Christ was slain our faith in that sacrifice is a finished work it's the atonement so Christ isn't out there in heaven dying continually before the father for our sins and he's not necessarily reminding the father that we accepted the sacrifice but he stands there throughout these seven Church ages as the mark the perfect one the one that's meeting that the bleeding bloody sacrifice the perfect one this perfect word through the church ages there as a buffer interceding over ignorance but now we have a voice saying repent amen why the Final Phase of redemption is underway it's the entire word that comes forth yesen therefore there's a message of Mercy brother BR I think he said it when we read the other day the Cry of Mercy before judgment a warning and what's the warning the warning is if you stay where you are you can't make it if you hold to your Creeds you hold to your Traditions you hold to the lies you hold to the partial truth if you don't come to Christ if you don't forsake tradition I theology I idolatry all those things if you don't forsake it if you don't come out of her out of organization out of nanism out of out of all these things and you don't come to Christ as individuals amen I mean too bad we couldn't just start a church and say whoever goes here is safe you've got to do this as an individual if you don't come out of her and come to Christ tribulation is what's left you won't be G gathered with the wheat into the Garner at the time of the change in the meeting in the air when this Rapture goes you won't be a part of it and when you look out on the systems and the organizations and the splitting and all the different definitions of Jesus the thousands of different denominations all preaching to you a different Christ brother brandom in the sermon The God Who is rich in Mercy Brothers if you could come to your instruments he says the God who is rich in Mercy what we need on the scene today is a prophet that will destroy the idol of denominations that thinks they're going into heaven upon the belonging upon belonging to some Creed or denomination needs to be destroyed and burnt up and thrown away he's pronouncing judgment on these organizations he says what we need is a prophet to come a prophet that'll destroy the idol of denominations but not to judge everyone therein right this is me amplifying this is me looking at the totality of God who is rich in Mercy it's not a prophet to come on the scene and just burn the whole thing up but to get the wheat out first God is full of Mercy he's rich in Mercy in the day that when we could have all been in that chaos of Darkness out there but God rich in Mercy has sent us the real genuine Holy Ghost with his own interpretation to it right here in the building every night God rich in Mercy how wonderful we find him to be this is the Cry of of Mercy this is the pronouncement of judgment it is the day of Vengeance of our God it is the day of the Lord please don't attach any traditional understanding to these things and don't run it through a denominational filter you bring it before the Lord ask God give you the the perfect clarity of these things things that are transpiring spiritually or things that are in type or foreshadowing just be sure you stay true to how God is going to reveal this to you but I'm wanting you to see these things in the scripture that we're living in a time where the Prophet is saying judgment is striking judgment is hand who is that Lord up there who is it that's our Lord what is it revealed himself as the supreme authority the Supreme judge of Heaven and Earth and what does he come he's come declaring his word for all seven seals are open to those who can receive it everything is ready it's a message of Mercy now this message has been run through filters and hasn't always been accurately expressed but my prayer is that God who is rich in Mercy would reveal himself to you that you could be a vessel of Mercy not only one who's obtained it and one who has been filled with Mercy but one who has Mercy that's renewed every morning ones who can be merciful amen and can show Mercy because the day of vengeance is in God's heart but the year of the redeemed is come this is why even Scholars and uh commentators and those throughout history when they looked at the events of Revelations 5 they saw it as a change from intercession to Redemption they could see this transition of this time when the lamb was doing something very specific but now it's time for fullness of redemption that's the time that we're living in now I believe and in this hour and in this time God has sent to us a real genuine word to call us out of the chaos of Darkness out of the deformity of ignorance why did he have to do it because ignorance is no longer a court of appeal for God's judgment if you couldn't take it for absolute fulfillment in type God for years brother Bram said through the church ages he was an intercessor to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people but now but now these are my words but now he commands everywhere to come unto him come to me come out of her my people come to the word come back to the Faith of Our Apostolic fathers come back to the word and in that word there's the salvation for the meek there's the Comfort to all that mourn there's the appointment to quickening power to snatch us from death into life there in there is where there's power to rise above and to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye if we could stand together and pray
