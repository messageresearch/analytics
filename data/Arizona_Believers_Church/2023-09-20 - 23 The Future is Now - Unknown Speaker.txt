TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to title the service tonight the future is now and I believe I've alluded to this a little bit um previously and in looking at this to say that the future is now I go I guess that I'm sure that you recognize maybe there's a little bit of a paradox in those terms but there's just something I really want to emphasize and I felt impressed to minister on this tonight just to give some context to some of the specific things that we've been ministering on in Kingdom identity and even last Wednesday night on Kingdom worthy a lot of specific things that were expressed from is your life worthy of the Gospel a lot of things alluded to in our relationships to one another especially in our marriages and our home home life and our families and I just thought that this would be a way of just kind of giving some more support and backbone to those things as they may be very specific and precise in our daily lives I'm hoping this kind of encourages us a little bit to see why those things matter so much now in Luke chapter 14 as Jesus is alluding to a feast and inviting ones to a supper and then he begins to talk about a man who made a great supper and paid many it kind of hearkens back to what he was saying here in verses 12 and 13. and as he says you'll be recompensed in the resurrection of the just to a Jew that was a time of the messiah's Kingdom on Earth the restoration of the Kingdom to Israel and it would be there would be a resurrection of all those faithful just Jews that believed and when the in verse 15 this person says and when one of them that sat at meat with them heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God and we were drawing from this last week from is your life worthy of the Gospel how that many excuses were made when the invitation to that Kingdom would come and the Paradox of this is the man says this to the Messiah the very one who would denote that Kingdom the kingdom of God and the one that says that all blessed is he who will sit down in the kingdom of God and here's Christ who is the very image of that and we could say that the Messiah at that very moment was sitting down eating bread with them and feasting with them and a kingdom opportunity was being presented and it was being missed it was already there manifesting itself in some way you know in Matthew chapter 4 verse 17 it says from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand this is something being manifested to Israel at that time and though it's not the full fulfillment of it or the perfect realization of the of the some of the prophecies in the Old Testament and some of the Kingdom elements that they were looking forward to uh the there was a manifestation of the Kingdom the kingdom of God is at hand and the Jews are missing it and The Parables as we said before in Luke chapter 14 we're addressing their misconceptions about the kingdom uh we even went into detail how that when the kingdom would be the invitation would be given to them they would despise it they would belittle it they wouldn't even recognize what it means and Christ when he comes preaching that the kingdom of God is at hand he's manifesting things that show what Adam lost was being restored back to mankind the the signs and wonders in his life were showing this is Supernatural this is above natural this is not just something that in who one in Adam's race can accomplish and the Jews and a lot of this is reviewed tonight the Jews believed that there would be a kingdom established on Earth they weren't looking for a kingdom in the heavens they were looking for heaven to be established on Earth and that there would be a future Kingdom this was always kind of in their thought process and even in Acts chapter 1 verse 6 when Jesus is appearing amongst them after his resurrection when they came together they asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel so this is something really at the heart to a Jew there was an eagerness to see the kingdom established on Earth and I want that to be again I want to remind you of that that to a Jew it wasn't a matter of leaving the Earth and going to heaven but they believed in a kingdom on Earth and though they believed in that and they're looking for it there was a misunderstanding of what the kingdom looked like because it had been presently manifested to them and there was an element with respect to times and Seasons to where they they didn't know how that Kingdom would come into manifestation John chapter 18 verses 35 and 36 when he's standing before Pilate at Christ is being examined and pilate answers says am I a Jew thine own nation and the chief of priest have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done now in terms of asking are you are you the Messiah are you a king and they're trying to trying to figure out who he is and does he belong to Israel is this their King is this their leader and pilate's objection is your own people your own nation that you're supposedly this king of has delivered you unto me uh what have you done and catch how Jesus answers this and this is very direct Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence now Jesus is using this emphasis in this repetition of my kingdom my kingdom my kingdom and my servants and he says my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world then my servants who hear my voice and and know who I am they would fight for me and they would fight against those that have taken me captive they would fight this proceeding and what Jesus is saying he says my kingdom is not from hence this kingdom is not political it was not natural it wasn't too resist pilate it wasn't even to resist the things that were transpiring in that realm at that time it's not supported by uh or perpetuated or kept going by worldly principles uh scribes and Pharisees and those of the nation have delivered me to be crucified but that's not where my kingdom fights it's not a natural battle they don't need to come and defend me in these Halls they don't need to go out and hire the best attorney they don't need to try to kick down the door and come in and steal me away in the night and rescue me as a as a hostage from you he said my kingdom is not a part of these elements it's not a part of these worldly kingdoms and these worldly proceedings if they if it was then you would see the kingdom manifested in those ways and many Jews as I already said already they believed in a future Kingdom but were missing the present manifestation and now to kind of turn it to our mindset Christian theology has created a separation between the kingdom and the Earth that this element of time and where we exist now in these Dimensions we know it is a Proving Ground but it's set up as if it's only temporary and while we're here we're to make a decision to serve God because if we don't serve God then we're going to go to either we're going to go to the bad place and Christian Theology and I would say Catholicism has divided the future between an eternal hell and an eternal heaven so if we do that then we kind of relegate what we do now on Earth as being a place where you make your decision and just hope you don't change your mind before you die and this is a really heavy emphasis in Catholicism because you got to make the right choice because the soul is eternal and if you haven't made the right choice your soul will live forever in Hell or your soul if you made the right choice will live forever in heaven and it creates that divide where now the Earth is kind of in limbo in one day it's going to be completely destroyed and all that exists is hell in heaven so you better make sure you're on the right side and Beyond the error in the doctrine of an eternal hell and the complete you know and they believe the annihilation of the earth there's a practical impact that that kind of mindset has on life presently and we have to be careful because we can have the attitude of well one day one day and one day this is going to happen and one day this will be and we know there's certain promises to in the life to come but we can take those very promises and then they become kind of this elusive future where if you look at the Jews and they they've received they should have received the very prophecies that were made to them but yet now they still long for the days of the Messiah when it's come and gone and we can be guilty of the same thing where we just put so many promises off into the future so many different manifestations off into the future and it's kind of like just one day one day we're gonna get there one day we're gonna have this and we fail to embrace the promises of God right now and fail to embrace all the opportunities and power of the Kingdom as it's made available to Believers right now and that's why I take this title the future is now we do believe that one day the the kingdom is going to be established on Earth it's going to be a millennial Reign on Earth and we know there's going to be a temper there's going to be another complete renovation of the Earth in its atmospheres and there's going to be a New Jerusalem that comes on the earth and the City of God is going to be established and there's going to be a city there's going to be those that rule in rain and there's going to be a great Eighth Day so we have a millennial rain we have the Eternal rain but right now there's a spiritual Kingdom in effect with a power over all worldly kingdoms now as we read already in Revelations chapter 1 how he has may have made us Kings and Priests and I want that to be kind of the focal point for tonight I want to catch in verse 4 Revelations chapter one verses four to six we'll read a few things in before we get to verse 6. I catch this background and we're going to draw from places where brother Branham adds um some scriptures to this and he says John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ I hope you're reading that and see just how he's broke that up who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood now I'm wanting to give you some background before we get to verse six where he says he hath made us Kings and Priests and this is this is all describing uh what God has done for us and the role of Christ in this he loves us and he's washed us from our own sins and his own blood and brother Brad I'm looking at this scripture says consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood now again my title of the night is the future is now so things that have been speaking of things that will be and yet I don't want us to look into the past and let's look into the future let's see how it applies now and he says consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power in bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete now let's recognize this that the perfect blood has loosed us from the power and bondage and defilement power bondage and defilement of sin therefore you're losing is perfect and complete and he says there is now therefore no condemnation and in Romans chapter 8 verses 31 to 34 which is where kind of pointing to that chapter that there is thou therefore now no condemnation notice how Paul says this what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us you should chew on that a little bit and this is something I don't want you to get so lost in thought you don't hear another word I say but maybe just make a note of it I want to go I want to meditate on that as I go to bed tonight if God before us who can be against us and this is a quite a question to get you to begin to think about well I mean that's a good point if God is for me if God is on my side if the perfect blood of God has loosed me from the power bondage and defilement of sin and that loose in his perfect and complete then who can come against me he says he's he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things I love Paul just laying in these questions one after another who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yet rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us this is these are words of encouragement saying well who can condemn you Christ died the Messiah has died he's give it shed his own blood now he's been raised up to a place of power at the right hand of God he's interceding for you who can lay any charge against you if God before you who can be against you and as if he's anticipating may be objective well um you know well so and so he says well there's Christ then who intercedes for us and there's none that can lay any charge to you and there's none that can condemn you and he opens that chapter in verse 1 Romans 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus I like how he kind of qualifies this who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit this is a promise or maybe more of a threat I'm not a threat I mean it's at least clarifying you want to walk after the flesh you're going to feel condemned and it's not God that condemns you you condemn yourself there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that is that is to say that those of us who those who are born again that's the rule follow the spirit be led to the spirit he says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made us free from the law of sin and death there is therefore now no condemnation the blood of Jesus Christ has washed us from all sins unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood we have been set free so it continues in the church age book there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation this is right now How can there be there's nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless he says don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood now don't get tied down again by traditions and Creeds and organizations let's hear this for ourselves he says don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves Hills fills with the Holy Ghost in power don't don't be tied down by that don't be led astray by anyone that would want to want to water down the power of the word of God water down the promises of God put it in some other age and sometime past he says you are God's free men loosed by his blood if you still hold your faith to Creeds and denominations it is certain by the evidence that you have lost your faith in the word got to be loosed from all creeds and this is Brother Branham amplifying this very scripture to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood we are free from condemnation we are free from uh from guilt and this leucine he says it's perfect and complete and brother Brown Builds on this to come to verse six where it says in Revelations one and a hath made us him that loved us washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen now let's think of this doxa this Glory this character and this Dominion to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever and I want you to see how brother Branham kind of even picks that up and gives it some some flesh he he writes this he half made us now he's quoting Revelations 1 6. he hath made us he goes oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them in a time when people have platforms to highlight emphasize and repeat the things that they want to repeat and I'm just referring to all sorts of things whether it be dietary habits or exercise habits there's certain emphasis repeated emphasis and a lot of highlighting to certain things and I believe as as Believers we ought to know the things that God has highlighted the the kind of the evolution of the message the progressive revelation and the message and what brother Brandon began to highlight and want us to really hold too and hold dear to our hearts in the open of the word and he says this is a truth we need to emphasize he says this is one that needs to be emphasized he says he and that's a point of emphasis he hath made us and and given his emphasis salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace and he says he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose this is where he comes to this we are Kings spiritual Kings so this loosing or by his blood this cleansing this perfect and complete losing was for a purpose not so that there could be some oh you're loosed and you're forgiven and you're Justified sorry he's taken care of and one day this Earth is going to be destroyed and that soul is going to live forever in heaven that that's not the sum and substance of it all he says that he has done it for a purpose he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are his King spiritual Kings he says oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne now we could either look forward to a the reign of the king king of David the son of David in the millennium or we could look forward to that time in the Eighth Day in eternity as we see both of those images presented in the future home and we can say one day he will and we can see some future promise but he says but now We Are Spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom this deviates from a lot of Christian theology that solely looks at the Kingdom as something that will come into manifestation at a future date at a later date after the resurrection but now brother Brahms one is to recognize there is a spiritual Kingdom now where you are spiritual Kings and you Reign right now over a spiritual Kingdom in Colossians chapter 1 verses 13 and 14 who have delivered us from the power of Darkness their Satan's kingdom and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son or the reign of his dear son the Dominion of his dear son and whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins this is how brother Branham is working into this Kingdom Reign he says we have Redemption through his blood that blood is a perfect blood that blood has completely and perfectly loosed you and therefore having been completely loosed by the blood we are Justified we are forgiven being justified and forgiven we can occupy this a unique Place upon Earth as being redeemed Sons and Daughters of God with a spiritual Reign on Earth right now in Romans chapter 5 verses 16 to 21 kind of highlighting this idea of a rain right now translated into the kingdom reign of his dear son that's present tense Paul doesn't say and one day you'll be translated out of this earth into into heaven he's saying no right now we've been translated into the kingdom reign of his dear son Romans chapter 5 verses 16 to 21 and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation and there is now no condemnation as it comes to Romans 8 but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification for by one man's offense death reigned by one so uh as we have been delivered from the power of Darkness that's an element of the worldly kingdoms now he is looking at death reigning by one by one man's sin through Adam death enters into human race not as mankind lost his position with God and His Fellowship in relationship to God through one man's Disobedience much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ this is a different rain this is the reign of death death reigned by one and now there's going to be a reigning in life through a gift of righteousness receive the abundance of Grace by Jesus Christ therefore is by the one offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's Disobedience were many made sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded Grace did much more bound that his sin hath reigned unto death now listen as Sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord and we we do not want to make the mistake and say oh one day one day I've been thinking about it just over and over and over again it's been turned into my heart how brother Branham said as a young boy there was a spirit that hovered over him saying wait a little while longer and and here he is recognizing acknowledging that there's a spirit that says just wait just wait a little while longer and this was with speaking to a young man who ought to surrender his heart to God who ought to give his all to the Lord and who cares what opportunities you're going to pass up in this world whether it be a scholarships or whether it be job opportunities or travel opportunities or relationships or accomplishments why would you let that uh keep you from yielding to him say oh well I don't want to miss out I I don't want to miss out on this I don't want to miss out on that and he said the devil got around your spirit hovered over me and said wait a little while longer and that's the that's the same Spirit though it might not keep you from salvation that same spirit will just say oh it's off in the future one day one day one day as if there's going to be some trip to a Mecca that's going to satisfy it for you when right now the promise is here today is the day of salvation and Grace can Reign through righteousness under eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord so brother Branham says right now we reign with Christ now let me just quiz you when when do we reign with Christ how many says that that's that we do not Reign right now show of hands okay you're listening it's always funny when you do that and someone's been asleep and they just get the idea that they need to raise their hand everybody's awake tonight right now we reign with Christ right now so if there's going to be a future rain and so well one day we're gonna brother bam said oh there's going we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne one day in the eighth day one day in the in that Millennium one day we will be but right now so from the future you're going to reign with him and in the future future you're going to reign with him guess what the Futures now because he says right now we reign with Christ right now we've been translated into the kingdom as dear son right now the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by Jesus Christ and Grace can Reign through righteousness right now it says right now we reign with Christ and now this is where you want to jot this down having Dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil no wonder Paul said if God before us who can be against us who shall lay anything through to the charge of God's elect he says right now we reign with Christ and as spiritual Kings we have dominion can't consider that word Kingdom so this is a king with a domain right now we are Kings and our Dominion is over sin the World the Flesh and the devil Paul said it made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever brother Adam says right now we're Kings and he says showing forth his praise and glory this is how we show it forth by having dominion over sin by having dominion over unbelief having dominion over the influences of the world having dominion over the spirits that are in the world having dominion over the flesh having dominion over the tempter the devil and the accused of the Brethren showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure this is the kingdom ring yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and made us priests so there he says he hath made us Kings and now he says he's made as priests what an incredible uh coming together we see in the Bible the example of a king that intruded on the office of a priest and God smote him with Leprosy and there was even Saul was not to intrude on the office of a prophet there was this division of King HUD in the priesthood but now he said I've made you Kings and Priests we see these promises in the Old Testament Israel was going to be a nation a royal priesthood a nation of Kings a nation a priest and he says he's made as priests now yes priest unto him offering the spiritual kind of got mixed lost this year let me find where I'm at yes priest unto him offering the spiritual praise I think I skipped something yes indeed is Christ in US willing to do it of his own good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I want to come back to that because how often does brother Graham say when now see that now now seated in Heavenly places and made us priest yes priests unto him offering the spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips spending our lives I think of that spending our lives not structuring our church services spending our lives as a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth why is it we like to think that they that worship Him shall worship Him in spirit and Truth only takes place within the four walls as if this is the arena that counts and and there's a life spending our lives worshiping him in spirit and a truth interceding and petitioning the role of the priesthood that we have now is not to play church but to suspend Our Lives interceding to spend our lives petitioning spending our lives our very lives as a sweet offering unto him our very lives being a life song worshiping him and spirit in the truth priests and Kings into our God and he says no wonder the world does not appeal to us no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are peculiar people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father this is what it means when he says he hath made us Kings and Priests and that spiritual Dominion is right now right now we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil and therefore as we live our lives we're showing himself Christ in us both willing and doing of his good pleasure we've been recreated in him to show forth the Praises of him who's called us out of darkness and Delight and this uh brother this is Brother Branham in chapter one of the church age book amplifying verse six he hath made his Kings and Priests right now we ruled in reign now I'm glad that we have plenty of time to get into this and I realize now we're just making such good time that I don't expect the service to to be lengthy in any way this is a little bit of a kind of a large step in Revelations chapter 5 verses 7 to 10 we're going to find where this phrase Kings and Priests comes up again and now the context isn't John at the introduction of the book of the Book of Revelation but it's at the time when the very book of redemption is being opened this title deed as brother Branham calls it and his connection to creation and Adam's position and relationship and Mankind and all the creation and this lamb comes in verse seven and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne brother the most Sublime act in scripture and when he had taken the book now this is something responsive of them in heaven the four beasts and four and 24 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song now this is a new song this is a new praise this is new worship this is a new utterance at the time that the book is being opened saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hath redeemed us to God by the blood by thy blood out of every Kindred now just think of how this Kingdom's been be made up through all these Church ages and this Kingdom being built up and now at the time that the book is open there's this new song that is sung and it has just such a rich symbolism you've redeemed Us by the blood of God out of every Kindred in tongue so this is just not Jews but this is redemption in people and Nation and it says it hath made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth I'd like to make this statement I know that we've said it before that these very things that are transpired in Revelations chapter five the very words that are being uttered and John saying everything that was in Earth and in heaven and beneath and Beyond he said I heard I John declare it and crying out that these events that are taking place are connected to Creation their connection to Genesis chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2. we know that this is the full Redemption of everything that Adam lost as brother bam dramatizes this book was the title deed of redemption that when Adam fell this book went back into the hands of God but now there is a restoration of dominion Adam was given a charge to have dominion and to subdue these are the very words of Genesis 1 Genesis 2 this is the very image in that beginning that he was to have dominion he was to subdue so when this these words are going forth this is very significant in terms of the perfect realization of all that was promised in terms of redemption he has made us Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth now there's no question to say that we shall reign on the earth that even those that are Before the Throne of God that are giving this utterance that this this is some looking forward to this time in this moment when either the son of David will establish his throne on Earth in the Millennium or his throne that's established over everything in the New Jerusalem there's going to be a reign in the future but brother man says right now we're spiritual Kings and brother Branham takes this and he makes quite a statement and this the the way this was transcribed years ago they didn't quite have the the wording just right but then as they cleaned the tapes up and got a little bit clearer uh transcription this it brings this out it says the Saints under the altar screamed out worthy are thou o lamb for you have redeemed us this is the 4 and 24 and in the prayers of the Saints are all kind of coming to this picture in verse 9. and now you've made us Kings and Priests and we shall rule on the earth that's him quoting Revelations 5. verse 10. oh my and that so when he opened that book you catch what he says there says that there's there's this crying out you've made us Kings and Priests and we shall rule on the Earth but now there's something very significant that's coming into manifestation right now on Earth he said that so when he opened that book there's something that unfolds there's some manifestation of the kingdom when Christ was on Earth in his first coming he's preaching the kingdom of that God is at hand the kingdom is at hand and was it the full restoration of the Kingdom that Israel is looking for no but was the kingdom being manifested was there a power being expressed was Redemption being declared yes and though there may not be a complete summation of a throne of the the son of David or even that Eternal Kingdom in the New Jerusalem but right now now that he has taken that book and opened that book there is a manifestation of the kingdom and a manifestation of a priesthood that rules on Earth right now he says you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book The Bible was really written before the foundation of the world and Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the last book of life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up so if I could say this before I read the next part when this book's open there's a loosing of the names in the book Kings and Priests their their rightful place a priesthood was reckoned according to genealogy and they did it by opening books I think one of the most important sermons I've ministered was on name calling and it to me it's such an important uh sermon because it was just a very big a strong burden in my heart to express and maybe the title maybe a lot of people say well you know sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me and they just kind of move right on and they think maybe it has something to do with calling people foolish names but it's it's about your name being called in this end time and how there's a name called and remember a name is not just the sounding Out of something but a name speaks of character it's not just Jesus it's the character behind the name it's not just the Lord Jesus Christ but it's the life and the character of that name in what that name represents so if a name is going to be called if there's going to be a loosing of the book it's going to declare a genealogy that reckons you back to the throne it reckons you to the priesthood and therefore there's a losing things that have held you back there's a there's a removal of any condemnation if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart there is something that sounds forth in this end time from this message that goes to Great Lengths to strike down anything that would try to condemn you anything that will try to tear you down anything that would get you discombobulated in your mind think oh well maybe it's for another day or maybe I don't deserve it that's the word of God under the opening of these seals trying to strike off anything that will try to hold you down and he says that these names he says but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names are written in there and all about it and what a great thing now this I just want to allude to this and I have to be very careful I just even kept some things out of my notes otherwise it there's a there's a channel you get pulled into it's I would just say maybe it's a lot of fun for me to preach but there is then as brother bam talks about a blending of Time and Eternity and us being time space creatures and we're Bound By The Elements of Light time and matter and we exist within that realm right now as human beings but now there comes a a juncture and in that there comes a blending there's a blending of things and brother Eliza Castillo was telling me just how awesome it was to come and preach uh quantum physics to the our church and then afterwards uh he told me one of the people in the church came up just said I've been I've been considering I've been thinking a lot about quantum mechanics and shared some things and and he said he got schooled in and out on string theory and everything and he said I just it was just amazing and I thought that was great there's a there's a blending of the things of time and Eternity and I know that some people quote brother Branham as saying you know we'll speed up and they'll slow down but I don't think it was brother brother Branham that said it is brother Tidwell I think that wrote it and so there's there but there is kind of this harmonizing not of all of the Earth but it's a harmonizing of us who have been born after the flesh there's a harmonizing of our spirits and our souls and our minds and our bodies to to Eternal things so that if right now we rule and Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom that's a supernatural Kingdom I I could say that it's an unseen Kingdom we can't approach a physical Throne it doesn't have a physical scepter but it's greater than all natural things and right now its powers over sin the World the Flesh and the devil so send the World the Flesh and the devil represents all these Natural Things and we exist Within These natural Realms but there's a blending together of them and brother Branham if you could maybe take your own time to study these things our brother Branham shows us the five temporary manifestations of the third poem and there was just these little glimpses that came in as he temporarily manifested these little glimpses of the temporary manifestations of the third pull you'll find that he had there was power to raise a little fish back to life there is power to create squirrels where there were no squirrels there was the power to forgive sins in the sense that Hattie Wright was given her sons there was power to cause a tumor to be taken away and then there was power to control nature and to draw and to harmonize with that nature and to walk with God on Earth because there he is in Colorado and he says oh would you walk with me be the greatest privilege I've ever known and there is a temporary manifestation of the third pool he said there I was walking with him think a little bit about it you you know the the testimonies you know the the things he shared in the message of the hour and then he sees the Nature's coming he says don't you know I can shoot you in a moment why all of creation is being drawn to something because it speaks of a power to come it speaks of a kingdom to come and so there's a blending together the third pull is the open of the word if that Eternal Word is opening now to people on Earth there's a blending together and those temporary manifestations of the third pull what will it be when it comes into full manifestation [Music] thought about even the change of this body how that blending begins to take place sister brother Victor sister Sandia was a privilege to minister sister Margarita's funeral and and so I was just looking at these thoughts of we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed I appreciate the privilege you gave to me uh to be able to minister that it means a lot to me and and the change of our bodies and so I have so much that's just welling up within me and notice what the Bible says here in First Corinthians 15. verses 22 to 26. and I'm wanting this to be context you know brother Branham says we hardly have enough tooth for uh enough enough teeth where are you from Arkansas um or West Virginia we hardly have enough Faith to heal a toothache he says we're supposed to have faith to change our body now I know that's kind of that's a that's a nice realm to work within right because you know if you have a toothache you have a toothache because you have teeth or at least a tooth right yeah and and that's and that's that's why and so I kind of feel good about that I got a headache and I have a headache because I have a head and you know and I need to have enough I need to have enough Faith to change my body I don't have enough Faith right now uh two to over you know to for healing in my headache but you know how about just being having a faith to say no to the world I and you have to have enough Faith to say no to death and you can't say no to death by chocolate at the restaurant come on somebody so now he says in First Corinthians chapter 15 verses 22 to 26. for as an Adam all died now notice that symmetry to Romans chapter 5. and Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive for every man in his own order Christ the first fruits remember in Revelation he was the first born among the dead there's just such such tight continuity among these scriptures afterward they that are Christ's that is coming then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall put down all rule in all authority and Power that's something there's some heavy stuff to think about when is this what does this relate to now he said something here that's very critical for he must Reign him till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last in me that shall be destroyed is death now that's I think that says a lot and maybe I'm just doing it a disservice by kind of just moving past it but notice how he's saying that there's going to be a delivering up of the Kingdom to God and there's to be putting down of all Rule and all authority and Power that there's gonna there should there's only gonna be one Kingdom That Remains and he must Reign he must have dominion until all enemies are under his feet and he says The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death so if there's a reigning a ruling and reigning where is this Dominion where is this authoritium and in Romans chapter 16 verse 20 he says in the God of Peace shall Brew Satan under your feet shortly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet there there is a body on Earth today that represents the kingdom of God being made spirit and life there are people in Earth today who have heard their names called by the word of God and they are the ones right now who are anointed to reign with Christ now having them even over sin the World the Flesh and the devil and is by your feet that Satan is being bruised and this death that's going to be defeated there are going to be a people on Earth there will be a people on Earth who are going to defeat death and I want to share this and maybe forgive me if I haven't built enough around this but I just want to share this quickly you remember when brother Branham in 1961 when he's preaching Paradox tells of him having that vision of that mamba that that snake and it represents sin represents death and brother Branham is talk about how he was coming up to a river he says I drew near the river I looked back and seen which way I'd come and I was two-thirds of the way there to Jordan and and so now he's entered in that that third that third part you first pull you have second pull now the third pull is what's going to bring you in a spiritual way into that Rapture into that a criminal cross he said I look across Jordan I said oh praise God just on the other side there lay all the promise where all the promises lay every promise lays in the Promised Land narrow Highway and there's a there's a snake there in the way as he begins to describe it he says everyone was scared to death of that strike because that it was certain death or instant death certain death if it bites you and and this is something that brother Branham is sensing and feeling and there's this representation of this this sin and death if it bites you it's death and and he tells how the the snake came to brother Branham and I went to bite him but something was holding it off it couldn't bite them and then he said it started going after his friend I think he kind of describes how it's leaping everyone's scared to death trying to get away from it so as he's taking this scene in he says the voice came from above him said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any you've been given power to bind him the worst or any so when I looked at the serpent and then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent of blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made that sign like an S capital S backwards an and sign he says and me and means buying this one or anything below him because he was the worst now this what I want to express to you is that this word that has been revealed to you this word that you're feeding on this power of God that's on the inside of you this Kingdom Reign that you're a part of right now is greater than anything in the world whether it be sin the flesh or the devil it's greater than any of it and so now what's being represented here is you've been given power to bind the worst I've been given part upon the worst if you're going to have power to bruise Satan unto your feet if the Last Enemy which is going to be destroyed is death and you're going to have power over death that means you have to have power over sin sin has to have been dealt with and then if it sin is dealt with death is dealt with if unbelief is dealt with then everything else has been dealt with because he says if you bind this one then you can bind anything beneath him oh I hope you can hear that if you can bind and belief if you can bind death if you can bind the worst then you can bind the least because he's the worst but then he says now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this and I know maybe it's at that point some of us just want to go oh well all right never mind but I believe that there's a desire to be more sincere don't worry these I've already preached this page tonight you must be more sincere than what you are to do this and the sermon Investments brother bear says what you need is a return back to the principles and the sincerity of the Gospel back to the real Pentecostal thing that produces Christ in the life of the people he says we get away from those real things this isn't something that we manufacture in our flesh we need to return back to the principles and sincerity of the Gospel when brother Barnabas challenged with this vision of buying the worst and and anything else he says You must be more sincere this means a greater consecration this is what God was speaking to me and it's a very plain all the way back in I think it was in mid-summer that that all hell is against us there's got to be a greater sincerity there's got to be a greater consecration and that's why maybe if I could share this in my way of Grace that it's just a Razor's Edge now and you wonder why you could have such a wonderful feeling of the presence of God and just get right back into a foul mood so quickly because God is requiring of us a greater sincerity and it's just a Razor's Edge that we could just fall off of it why because we ought to be more mature now we're coming right up to the moment where we've got to defeat death and we can't do this just by being willy-nilly and lackadaisical we've got to come back to the real Pentecostal thing that produces Christ in the life of the people it says we must be more sincere and he says you've been given power to bind him in Matthew chapter 16 Jesus is speaking to Peter he says and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven all hell is against the revelation of Jesus Christ and and this Revelation contains the knowledge to unlock the power of the Kingdom to unlock a greater consecration a greater sincerity than if I'm going to have power to find the worse then I've got to be more sincere I I've got to have a greater sensitivity to the spirit I can't walk after the Flesh and think that I could subdue condemnation I can't walk after the Flesh and be caught up in the whims of the Flesh and think that I can subdue the worst let alone anything else he says we've been given power to bind this serpent and as we ministered quite a bit on the tares we recognize that there's even this element of these tares that's in our spirits and in our bodies by a natural birth I I want to I want to express this as I close and musicians you could even come that if we have been given power that by this new birth and by the revelation of Jesus Christ with the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatever we bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever we shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven and right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil then if I have got power to bind I'm I'm not going to try to hunt down a Mamba out there somewhere I'm not going to try to hunt down a serpent I'm not going to try to find that Karen at the grocery store who's giving somebody her business and I'm going to speak my mind to her and bring her into order no I'm going to start by binding him here first I'm going to start if whatever is bound on Earth will be bound in heaven then I want to bind sin right here first I want to bind the world right here first I want to bind this flesh right here whatever's in my heart whatever's in my mind the future is now I want to bind him here now right now there can be a spiritual reign of the son of man before the literal reign of the son of David right now and I'll start with this Kingdom I'll start with me as the head of a house I'll start with me as the head of a wife I'll start with me as being the house band the husband that binds the home together I'll start with me and then I'll establish a Dominion in my home applying the token bringing things in order why because this is the power of the Kingdom because I don't want to fool myself into thinking that one day one day bride you're going to step on death and trip over everything in between brother Brown says in the sermon the world has fallen apart this is just after he preaches the seals he's I believe he's in New Mexico he says what are we looking for friends what are we the real church is looking not for denomination not looking for a president not looking for a genius to rise up but they're looking for a kingdom and a king to come what is the kingdom it's on earth now it's a spirit mystical Body of Christ [Music] in there they've come out of Presbyterian Methodist Pentecostals and everything they're in this Kingdom they're born in there they come in there by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they're in this Kingdom he's saying it's on Earth right now [Music] and we're looking for a king to come to this Kingdom set his kingdom upon up here on the Earth on a throne of them we shall Rule and Reign forever that's what the church looks for is that what we're looking for I'm looking forward to oh a millennial reign it's one of the funnest things to Fellowship on I'm looking forward to an eighth day those things are real they're promised but then he says and the good thing about it friends is think of this before we get to this Kingdom before this King comes he's talking about in the flesh to establish the literal Kingdom on earth now we can set together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus lifted up above all the shadows of all the corruption of the world and all their television programs all these other nonsenses they got on the Earth today and all their rotten pollution and systems and everything if I could say this my wife and I were fellowshipping on it and it's just such a beautiful truth that she was the one making the point that brother Brandon kind of chastised the Pentecostal people and said you used to not run to the picture shows he said the devil pulled one over on you and he put it in the home and so while we don't we don't go to the movie theater and he says now they put it in the home and that would be that was a box a television that only picked up certain channels that could just filter whatever it is into the home now the devil certainly got a little bit more creative or we've just gotten a little bit more inventive and we're killing ourselves with science because now we we may not have a television and and I don't know how much brother Brandon could have articulated that he saw but I mean who would have thought that we could all work from home and pay the bills all we need is a connection to the internet and access to things they're in and how that thing that has become even what they're trying to call a basic human right and that art can be subsidized and certain things paid for by the government because we need the Internet you need internet access and you need good bandwidth and you need to have access to certain things and how that through that where you need these things just to pay bills you need these things just to make appointments and do certain things that it through that same channel comes everything else and all the nonsense of the world and how much more than are we to be sincere given all these things that are in the world the Shadows of the crypts in this world their television programs all the other nonsenses they got on the Earth today and now it's not that the devil's pulled one over on us but now it's evolved where you can have things that aren't purely television but have access to all the things that brother Branham said were rotting our minds he says be lifted up in Heavenly places the Holy Spirit himself come upon us speak out and call to call to us our sins and tell us how to get straightened up and what we've done in life and what we're doing we can see these things pronounced in his ministry it's the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the king that shall come to his kingdom Sunday and his kingdom is now being established in the hearts of his people here on Earth thy kingdom come thy will be done in Earth as it is in heaven it's yield to it let's say the Futures now not one day wait a little while longer one day I'll do this one day I'll do that no make that we've got to be more proactive as parents we got to be more proactive in our dealings and and foresee the trouble that's coming and even look at the pattern in our lives of how certain things maybe got their hold on us and how certain things went a certain direction and say Lord I sanctify myself for their sakes I've got to be proactive I've got to be sincere I've got to be consecrated and and hopefully this calls to some part in your heart to realize these things aren't some kind of clothesline religion this isn't just some old-fashioned thing these are principles of the word of God that run very very deep and that are far that are for your benefit and I believe we ought to be considering them and I believe a beneficial prayer tonight the Lord help me to be more principled and be back get back to the sincerity of the Gospel so that the real Pentecostal thing can produce Christ in my life amen I know your desired prayer tonight so could you stand with me we'll pray with you
