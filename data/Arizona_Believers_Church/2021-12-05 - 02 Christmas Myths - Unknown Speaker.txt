TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matthew chapter one i'm read verse 23. i'm gonna just jump right on into the message this morning beginning with matthew chapter 1 verse 23 is our text we mentioned it wednesday night and i will say now and i may mention it again this morning is that i'm wanting to begin a series of services i think it's going to be seven in total on um on christmas the subject of christmas and beginning with chris myths christmas myths and um and i think that if as we begin to explore this subject and there could be some tensing up for some people like oh great here we go seven services on christmas where's this going i think listening to wednesday night sermon would be not mandatory reading it's not compulsory anything that's a mandate these days it gets us a little bit nervous but i think it would be advisable good to listen to that part um so that it kind of provides part of this foundation um for where we're wanting to go with this and i'm probably not going to end up where a lot of you think i am but i will probably touch a lot of spots that you think i would but there's just a beautiful truth that god is really emphasizing and highlighting to me this year and i want to bring it out to you by his grace and so matthew chapter 1 verse 23 i'm reading this and then it's gonna um i want to use it in contrast to another scripture here in a little bit but i thought this would be a good one to use as our text behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us amen let's just pray for a moment our gracious heavenly father as we have read from your word uh words that were pinned by the breath of god we pray that you would help us to stay within the framework of your scripture that in everything that we would say and preach this morning it would be in harmony with the spirit of the message of the hour and that we would in all things glorify you that we would not give any a preference to our opinions that we would not cater to pressure but lord labor to lift up the right thing so that in doing so your believers grow into a greater relationship with you and father i commit this service to you just desiring that if there be any uneasiness or nervousness in the people it would be dispelled as our desire is to purely lift you up so may you have preeminence we pray bless the word which we have just read the scriptures and the quotations that will be shared today in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and you can be seated it's we're on the subject of christmas and um our title is part two of christmas myths we mentioned even on wednesday night how that christmas and the celebrating of christmas and even a lot of the elements related to christmas can be controversial not just to the the outside uh or the atheist or the agnostic uh but it's controversial with within christianity itself amongst those who believe that jesus christ was the son of god born into the world of a virgin people who believe in the fulfillment of this very scripture uh referring to the prophecy in isaiah that a virgin shall be with child and this the angel lord expressing this to joseph that mary is with child of the holy ghost and she's going to bring forth that one whose name shall be emmanuel for those that believe in the very fulfillment of this so we believe christianity all of christendom believes that jesus christ was born into the world but yet the subject of christmas or the holiday christmas is controversial even amongst those that believe the very fulfillment of these scriptures and not only is it controversial within uh christianity or nominal christianity it's also uh kind of a sticky subject within society at large especially as it relates to the celebration and where you hear a lot of it is over the last many decades is how that christmas is a religious holiday and it needs to be separated out from government he needs to be separated out from being in our schools and so there's a lot of controversy even with society as secular people or non-believing people would feel that these things impose upon religious freedom and if you drill down into any one of the controversies whether it be within christianity or whether it be within society or within government or politics christmas is controversial largely due to its truth there's a lot of people that in society at large that are resistant to christianity uh for the on the basis that this is this is true it's true that jesus christ is the son of god who was born into the world at some point in time and was brought forth according to scripture and so it's truth is the stigma it's truth is the the um the sticky point it's the truth that causes people to oppose it and not to like it but it's not just it's truth but it's also controversial because of its myths and that's the part i'm wanting to focus on as well as not only the truth but the myth of it because there's a lot of things that people oppose and there's a lot of things that people accept and they think they're accepting truth or they think they're opposing error but at the end of the day it's just a bunch of myths the only thing that's gotten them riled up but the only thing that they're doing and celebrating the only thing that they're lifting up and participating in is mythology and the uh maybe this uh speaks to a lot of the things that are in my heart the myths contribute to the controversy by creating scarecrows that there's maybe there's something there's some kernel of truth but then myths begin to pop up all around it and it becomes a scarecrow to the truth it uh they they contribute to the controversy by uh stigmatizing certain things or certain practices or certain beliefs or certain times of year there's a myth will actually stigmatize and so you do something and say oh well you know that's this or you know it's that and it's these myths that are associated with it that allow people to color something is right or wrong but in reality it's just a myth that's behind it and then we talked about it on wednesday night and um and i think maybe it would be good just to touch on a couple points from that surface on how the the radicalization myth is where you may believe something very ardently and and we have basis to believe certain things in the scripture but what the critic would want to do is make us feel as if we become radicals and we become extreme and that whoa that is too far and that's fanaticism and the purpose of kind of putting that scarlet letter on you as a radical is to cause you to no longer do what you're doing and so sometimes people experience some sort of conviction or conflict in their hearts because you're doing something a particular way and they start feeling the conflict and they way that they resolve this is like well you're too legalistic or you're just radical or you're just too extreme and they're doing that and saying that kind of putting this label on you hoping that you abandon the practice or start doing something else to kind of relieve themselves of the guilt that they're feeling so there's a there's stigma there's a scarecrow there's even a label that people try to put on on us or upon others or that we can put on people to try to sterilize their faith and we need to be aware of polarization in any subject matter and even with respect to truths that the word of god is to draw us to christ paul dealt with this uh polarization within the corinthian church how i'm of this man and i am of that man and and what was happening is people are being polarized to personalities and he's saying listen we are to be polarized but to christ and if in our grouping or our cliques or our rallying is not around christ but it's to personality or politics or some sort of um propaganda then we got to be careful realize no this i'm being polarized i'm being drawn to something i'm being a very ardent disciple of something that is actually not christ or in the word and so we need to be aware of polarization and i think it's good for us to at times maybe at all times be honest about things that are our personal dogma as long as it's in the word of god we can say that's god's dogma that's the dogma we follow if god is dogmatic i want to be dogmatic but what i don't want to do is allow dogma my personal dogma to become doctrine and my personal discipline and my personal beliefs and my personal convictions that aren't rooted in the word of god that aren't broadly shared you know laid out in the word of god i don't want certain things that may just be the way i do things i think the example i used maybe on wednesday night is uh there are some christians that believe or that to ingest caffeine is a sin and and they have basis for it and they'll even use scriptures and there's a maybe a rich theology that's related to it i've never actually studied it maybe that's a new series for the new year um the caffeine myth but the um you pick something like that and where it where it begins to get uh controversial is when someone has a conviction or discipline and in a way of justifying it they try to make it the word of god so that if anyone drinks caffeine you're sinning against god how could you be a christian because you drink caffeine and that's where the divide begins to happen and then because of the divide and defensiveness people not only from dogma does it become doctrine but then you get defensive and then what happens people get further and further away and more and more entrenched and then you have extreme that's where you have your radicalization so what you want to be is balanced and that's what we emphasized and wanted to lift up wednesday night is we need to become balanced by the word and by balance we need to realize that god is in the god is in the middle of the road as brother branham referred to it want to stay right in the middle of the word we want to stay in the middle of the road and the extremes are the ruts on each side of the middle of the road there's a rut on one side there's a red on the left side if you want to use uh left and right um to describe um the extremes and say well that's the political spectrum absolutely i don't mind at all if you want to think of it that way because really to get caught up in either side is a rut become entangled in politics and partisan things it's a very very tricky thing we to stay clean from that so the extremes form the ruts on each side of the way of truth there's a way of righteousness is the way of truth there's a path that the righteous must be walking in and there's going to be ditches on each side of that way in the ditch on one side of the ditch you could deny truth on the other side of the ditch you can distort truth and so there's dangers in each side of it and my approaching this in this way at the outset before i really kind of get into the meat of the christmas message that is on my heart which is is not necessarily going to be in this service but my purpose is just really to address some subject matters to stimulate our minds instead of just thinking uh one way and being close-minded and closing off the word of god and putting a period on things or just adapting maybe something that we've been told but to really allow the word of god in its totality to begin to be impressed in our mind to come in our minds and stir up our pure minds and maybe impress itself in our hearts so that we have a well-rounded view according to the word of god um how we ought to approach things and how we ought to do certain things especially as it relates to christmas so i wanted to kind of stimulate your minds but at the end of the day the purpose is to bring a balance in the word of god as we read from the statement the deity of jesus christ brother brown preached this i believe it's the first mention of christmas and the message the deity of jesus christ he preached on christmas day 1949 he says the thing of it is it's so easy to fall in that rut on the other side there's a rut on one side there's a rut on the other side he says and push out christ the real fundamentals of christmas we could say the real fundamental of christmas is christ you take christ out of christmas all you have is this maybe a mess and so there's a the real fundamental of christmas is christ but when he says the real fundamentals of christmas that means that there are original principles relating to christmas and again when i say christmas i want to use it in more of a general way and not get too specific about dates and details but the original principle of christmas or we could say the birth of christ there are real fundamentals of that original principles and rules related to christmas and that's what brother branham identifies in this statement you have this way of celebrating you have this myth and you have this person and all these other things but when what we allow that to do is to push christ out of it he says there's no room for him at the end now on the subject of christmas myths a myth is an untrue story now there could be some element of truth to it but the reason why it's called a myth is it's an untrue story or rumor a myth is something that's imaginary and uh would be and i'm using a very strict definition perhaps of myth but it would be a fictitious object or a fiction fiction a tale of fiction or of whether it be an object or a situation or location or an individual that's generally what a myth refers to there could be ways that it could be referred to as legend there's a lot of uh academic discussion about what a myth is and what separates it from legend and if it's associated with religion it becomes one thing if it's associated with other uh practices or paganism it's something else but overall i use the term myth to refer to something that is imaginary or fictitious something that is untrue yet it's a story or tell of something that kind of has a details it becomes a mythology it's a myth that's really we hold it in our minds and it has some meaning to it but there's no truth to it is the idea that i'm referring to and so we're uh maybe putting we're looking at fact versus fiction that you have you have myth on one side and then you have truth on the other side you have fact versus fiction or fundamentals as brother branham would say the real fundamentals of christmas or the myths of christians christmas and the distinction i'm going through this exercise and i'm looking at this so that we as a church and we look at it together for the sake of truth but the idea is not just to go through and pick through something and say oh this is wrong and that's wrong and this is wrong as that that's wrong because really what we could do is take everything away from you and then leave you with nothing at all so the goal isn't to take this away and take that away and tear this down and tear that down but really the goal is to kind of sift through everything and find the truth and a lot of this comes back to how the lord has been dealing with me and we ministered on the subject of blind trust and bad faith that's with a lot of things that we just trust blindly that we ought not to and there's things that we can we call faith but it's really not faith we trust in it we believe in it and if it's not the word that's bad it's bad faith bad faith and blind trust there's a lot of things that we can hold as guiding principles and truths and convictions but if it's not if it doesn't have some basis it's not tangent to or in some way connected to the word of god or we haven't found a real reasoning in the scripture as to why we do it we need to be very careful in those areas and perhaps what happens is i'm trying just to remember exactly how the lord had dealt with my heart uh um in the in this way and i believe we touched on it last service how it's these things that come up and when there's really no basis in the word of god it becomes a fanaticism and then what the only thing that can keep that alive is something that's not true or something that's only partly true and so we then we we have to feed off of other things to kind of keep that idea alive instead of the word of god and it's not even that the word of god would tear that down but if you begin to feed on the word of god that thing would become so weak that it would kind of just shrivel up to its proper place in your paradigm maybe not get rid of it completely but it would find its place but the only way to keep that idea alive is to feed on things that aren't in the word of god so it's a it's a matter of not being distracted and feeding things that keep things very very large in our conscience in our spirits that really don't need to be not even an issue of right or wrong it may be absolutely right but it doesn't need to be that big like that's true but it's not that tall that's true but it's not that big it's true but it's not that important so certain things that we could really put into place and be balanced in now as we refer to christmas myths and i'm really nervous about the lisp in that um there are the myths are in both extremes it's myths that perpetuate the celebration of christmas and really a lot of the things i'm looking at right now in modern times it's myths that perpetuate the celebration it's the myths that in law that are the most uh pronounced ways of celebrating would you agree that what we see nowadays in with respect to christianity is not necessarily truth on display but more tradition and legend and mythology that is celebrated during the time of christmas but not only do myths perpetuate the celebration it's myths that perpetuate the criticism a lot of myths that that follow up behind and become the real the real acts or the sword or the meat to criticism of christmas as there's different titles that kind of begin to come into my mind in terms of how we might title the service but there's a it's the question many times of to celebrate or not to celebrate right to celebrate or not to celebrate to tree or not to tree these are the these are the big questions that begin to build up around thanksgiving and just after thanksgiving to celebrate or not but to tree or not to tree that is the question but remember the danger the dangers are in the ruts there's no danger in the truth the danger or is in the ruts the danger is in the frivolity of celebrating or there's also a danger in the animosity towards the celebrating the dangers are in the ruts there's no danger in the middle of the road but the dangers of when we allow the one extreme to push us into the other we go out of one ditch into the other or we stay very very much entrenched in the way we are because we see the frivolity or the criticism on the other side it's the idea that it's been expressed before on how that you have license on one hand and legalism on the other and you have those that are in license and they just make the grace of god a disgrace but then you have people on the other side that are legalists but where is the balance the liberty of christ right down the middle now this is the funny part if you are absolutely in the liberty of christ to somebody who's a legalist what are you in because you're on the wrong side you're in license but then now you think oh well i've got a friend no to those who are in license you're in perfect liberty so what do you look like a legalist so you can't try to find a balance to please everybody else you got to find a balance to please the lord you've got to find a balance to be in harmony with the spirit of christ that is inside of you and leading you so that there's no dissonance between you and christ so that we can make progress in the christian faith so that we can get out of here we want to leave we don't want to stay so i want to be in the perfect liberty of christ so that i could be leaving and not worry about those who are unlicensed that are going to think i'm a legalist and about the legals who think i'm in license as long as i know i'm in the liberty of christ and that gives me freedom to go forward then that's where i want to be realizing that there's these ruts that form on each side and camps that can be on each side a couple statements there's dozens of these that we could use many many many different statements as a matter of fact i put together a list last month to share with you i'm during this season of several sermons that i felt would be good to listen to during this time and i kind of pondered different ways of making them available and as in the process of getting together putting together had been going through them to put these sd cards together to give to you so that no one would have an excuse say well i don't know how to listen to the message if i heard that it would shock me but there may be some that don't know how to do it but there's several sermons and if you're in who would be interested in getting a list of several sermons we can listen to this month okay well a few of us all right well then i'll send out an email and give you a list of sermons that you could listen to just to stimulate sermons that i have been studying i think that would stimulate your thought process on at this time of year be very very helpful and beneficial and the message sirs we would see jesus this was on christmas eve in 1961 he says but it's also it also was the way of finding truth in life the unusual way not the set routine way but the unusual way this is important really even today when we would think that everything has been properly emphasized and the camps have been formed there's usually some unusual way that's the balance he says it's the unusual way and it's my heart's desire tonight that in this unusual scripture nothing that wouldn't necessarily be related to the birth of christ this unusual scripture that we will find the true meaning of christmas what christmas means to us the way that we should do it or how we should approach christmas these men if i could just say this just to kind of seed a little bit about what's in my heart these men were not seeking a babe in a manger but they were seeking christ he says this is the way this is what this is how we'll find the true meaning of christmas what christmas means to us that's the true meaning and then he says the way we should do it and how we should approach it this is something that's in this sermon that he's identifying very beautifully a very unique christmas message he preaches it in jeffersonville and then he preaches it later in new york uh but here in falling a part of the world this is in jeffersonville in 1962 and then when he preaches it later i think it's the next year in new york it's in november and it's even before thanksgiving and he's talking about christmas and like even brother branham wouldn't even wait till after thanksgiving um and he's preaching a christmas message and it's because he originally preached the thought in um in christmas the prior year so here he is december 16th of 1962 and he's praying and we would ask that you would bless us so together in this what we are celebrating the christmas season lord may we find the real spirit of christmas and may it abide with us forever does that bother some people the spirit of christmas because i guess there's a the spirit of christmas that people talk about but he's talking about it in the real spirit of christmas not not the spirit of christmas that causes you to go back to your car and find all the loose change you can to put it in the salvation army bucket uh but this the real spirit of christmas that just doesn't fade away with new year's resolutions like whatever we felt with new christmas and the giving and the joy and i love everybody and in this awesome it fades away once we become very very egotistical about my new year's resolutions what am i going to do for me how am i going to change and what do i regret from this past year and it all fades away the real spirit of christmas the real true meaning of christmas that tells us that there's a true meaning and there's a real spirit related with christmas so we could what what is um what i'm addressing and talking about christmas myths are the things that take us away from the true meaning and spirit of christmas it's the myth it's the missed truths it's the fiction it's the lies it's the it's the incorrect details that take us away from the true meaning of christmas and the spirit of christmas are you with me so far each one of you individually i just want to take my time this morning and share these things with you it's very very heavy burden on my heart as i realized that i am i'm i'm walking on thin ice maybe in some ways i'm a trapeze on on a balancing act between uh two tall towers i need to be very very careful that i don't offend anybody but it's the myths that will devalue the truth of christmas it's the myths that keep us out keep us from the real spirit of christmas now on the subject of christmas this may be where i'm really now starting to unpack the myths and i'm not going to do it like myth number one number two number three but um just maybe start looking at it this this uh gumbo as it were of ideas you know we'll just kind of um okay that was sausage oh that was chicken i don't know what that was but it's in the pot and we just try to think about it together there's two different subjects maybe even questions that relate to christmas and i want to separate these two there is a question of the origins of christmas like how did the uh the the celebration christmas being the celebration of the birth of christ that's a question of where did christmas originate the celebration of the birth of christ that's one question but then there's also another question of the date of the birth of christ so those are two separate questions one when was christ born you recognize that would be a different question right but then there's also a question would that be a different question then what are the origins of celebrating the birth of christ it makes sense that those are two different uh there's overlap obviously but there's those are two different questions in two different controversies um in two different discussions in some ways the origins of christmas and the date of christ's birth either way whether it be the origins of the celebration of his birth or the actual date of his birth the central issue is christ's birthday christmas is talking about the day when christ was born and then kind of what flows from that a lot of times is when to celebrate his birth if you're going to celebrate it at all so do we celebrate it yes or no no then don't worry about the date yes then when do we celebrate it does it matter when we celebrate that's kind of maybe the decision tree that we could have easily charted out for us uh do we celebrate it yes or no no then we don't need to worry about it take the name of jesus with you and we all go home salad to go and go or whatever and we enjoy our afternoons uh and and whatever we want to do on a sunday but there's obviously more to it we say yes oh yes we celebrate it then it could we could stay a few minutes longer and try to figure out the actual date that we would celebrate it but since it kind of revolves around a birthday remember i'm just want to stimulate thinking so if if we're all together in this i want to just all of a sudden just i think just kind of catch you by surprise but it's all about whether or not we celebrate a birthday but if we kind of take a step back a little bit there's really no history in scripture or even church history of any christians or jews or anyone for that matter ever celebrating a birthday period have you ever thought about that a birthday celebration a festival some festivities to commemorate a day when someone was born and so i want you to consider um the first where the origins or the ideas that we find in scripture with respect to birthday celebrations and what it signified scripturally and i'm just doing it to stimulate your minds i'm not trying to create a camp a new doctor and like well we at arizona believers don't even celebrate birthdays like we're more holy now because we figured it out that the air wasn't actually in christmas the air was actually in birthdays completely the only birthday we celebrate is when we were born again it's not that it's to be balanced but in job chapter 14 verse 4 again this is just to kind of stimulate your minds job says who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean one not one kind of the even i think one translation actually renders it that a man is unclean from the moment of his birth regardless of how short his life is that a baby only lived three uh three months or three minutes the scripture says a man who's born is unclean from his birth and there's so many other scriptures we could have used that speak of just a man born in this manner and having come in that manner it's an uncleanness so here's his he said a man who can bring an unclean out of an unclean no one can bring a clean from an unclean man is unclean therefore children that are born of a woman are unclean then leviticus chapter 12 verse 2 and there's several other verses that could be used in the law but it says speak unto the children of israel saying if a woman have conceived seed it's important to note what it's referring to through natural relations and born a man child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days of the separation for her infirmity and she shall be uncleaned and speaks she's unclean for longer if she has a girl that's another series i guess but it's just saying that when a woman has a baby that she conceives by natural relationships she has a child she's considered unclean i want you to kind of recognize what the characterization of the birth is under the law that the natural birth of unclean uh man and a woman do not bring forth the clean child the child itself is born unclaimed therefore the woman even given birth through this process she is characterized as unclean by the act of birth i want you to realize the place that the scripture puts the birthday and the act of giving birth and the celebration of one's birthday in the scripture was only done by heathens not a lot of birthdays in the scripture but in genesis chapter 40 verse 20 says it came to pass the third day this is in the story of joseph which was pharaoh's birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants you're thinking oh it's a time for a promotion right it's my birthday pharaoh's birthday they're all enjoying his birthday and he brings up the butler and the baker who had been in jail with joseph and now this would be a great opportunity for them to tell the pharaoh hey you know there's a guy who knows dreams and what did he do in this birthday celebration he hung the baker this is what he does it's his birthday and to celebrate his birthday it's this uh sensual demonic taking of life the shedding of blood that commemorates his birthday and this is what the heathen does to celebrate a birthday he hangs a baker the only other mention that we have of a birthday celebration is in mark chapter 6 verse 21 and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords herod not being a jew made a supper to his lords as high captains and the chief estates of galilee what does he end up doing executing john beheading john so here in these birthdays pharaoh's birthday celebration results in the hanging of a baker then herod celebrates his birthday and what does he do he executes john on his birthday this is the place that the scriptures put the birthday in jeremiah chapter 20 verse 14 cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my mother bear me be blessed this is a scriptural attitude towards one's birthday when they recognize just how small they are how flawed they are maybe the difficulties they have in life their mistakes their shortcomings he is saying not only don't celebrate my birthday but curse the day let it not be a blessed day it said it was said in the early church that not only did saints and believers not celebrate their birthday but those who are filled with the holy spirit cursed the day because it stood in such dark contrast to the newness of life that you experienced when you're born again it's like you it starts all it's something that's more precious to you listen it ought to mean more to us that there were christians than than were that were texans right any texans here i was at texas well eliza raised her hand she's the only one listening um i was at texas a little hole in the wall steakhouse here in phoenix the owner i think is from texas and it's all texas stuff texas and was talking to the owner this many many years ago and i was talking all about texas with texas braggadocio and he was like ah are you a texan and then it's like the moment of truth no i was actually born in arizona but i got to texas as fast as i could and he's like oh well that doesn't count i said but i was born again in texas and he goes all right i'll give it to you i didn't get a discount or anything but it's the new birth that ought to mean more to us than the nation of our birth we're not americans we are christian right that's the part and so you see this theme in scripture as jeremiah said curse my birthday i'm not again i'm not suggesting a new paradigm i knew you know when's your curse day and we're going to change the church directory to list the dates of curse in one column somebody celebrated a curse day this past week i know in the plet family one of the plet celebrated a birthday this past week not to cause any guilt for the manner in which these things are celebrated but just notice what the scripture is saying about it in job chapter 3 verses 1 to 3 skip to verse 7. this is job after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day what day the day he was born and job spake and said let the day perish wherein i was born and the nine in which it was said there is a man-child conceived let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it what does that mean for my birthday party verse seven lo let there be solitary let no joyful voice come therein this is an attitude towards the birthday and i want you to think about this for a moment based upon the attitude of jeremiah and job and i know there's a connection to their grief and their sorrow and their sins and the scriptures in leviticus and then the fact that birthdays in the scripture are only celebrated by heathens it would be more pagan to celebrate your birthday than it would be to honor christ's birthday i mean just stimulating thinking i didn't say that it is right but could it be that's celebrating our birthdays and when we have it marked on the count we have a really really big party and everyone brings gifts and there's cake and there's lights and there's confetti and there's tinsel and everything's just done up really really big and they're singing secular songs happy birthday right and and playing pagan games blindfolded peeling the tail on the donkey and all sorts of things that we do and all the traditions that are mixed into it um these are the things that we do on our birthday and the festivities and the frivolity and the excitement and all the things that we do hey and you say well that's for the kitties come on don't fool yourselves i mean what do we do for people's 40th birthday party look at how christian is we all dress in black right and the grim reaper really scriptural uh symbol symbolisms evident and present at these occasions and i want i'm just i'm just saying i'm not trying to you know stir anybody up and i don't want to create an anti-birthday segment but maybe i'm just wanting people to think more deeply about their convictions and their personal dogma that it might be pagan just to celebrate a birthday let alone christmas and i know some people are now sharpening their swords you got that right brother i never thought about it that way no more uh baby showers and no more birthday celebrations but think about this the bible says in psalm 51 5 david says behold i was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me says elsewhere the wicked are estranged from the womb that this event of a birth though though it may we know the side of it being a gift from god a heritage of the lord a great joy in having children and there's this whole side to it but there's a darkness to the fact that it is a child that is conceived in sin that it has been brought forth through iniquity shaped in iniquity incended my mother conceived me like these are the factors that came to bear upon job announcing what he did about his birth these are the factors that came to bear upon the very law in leviticus that a man born of a woman comes through that way with the stain of the first sin that comes through with the stain of wickedness and and it's shapen in iniquity in sin was i conceived that's our birthday but then think about the birth of christ it doesn't have the stain of any of that it says in matthew chapter 1 verse 23 behold a virgin shall be with child there's a very important distinction that's being made in the prophecy and the fulfillment of jesus christ a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us when you compare this to leviticus 12 2 you'll find that a woman who has conceived seed and born a child it refers to conception through a natural act and then brings forth a child that's what's dealt with in leviticus 12 but jesus does not fit within leviticus 12 neither does mary and i know that contributes to the merry myth but what does that mean the birth of christ is not stained with the uncleanness of natural birth it says a virgin shall be with child not necessarily conceived from a man it's it's implying a distinction from leviticus chapter 12 so that the birth of jesus does not carry with it the baggage of our birthday so with all of us you know wondering about birthdays i don't think we should be wondering about it but that's interesting isn't it have you ever thought about your birthday that way some of them i have a distinct memory of one of my birthdays being completely forgotten i mean i distinctly remember no one ever saying happy birthday and not being celebrated at all my family doesn't quite remember it that way but i remember it that way and until they remember the way i remember it we're never going forward not this family it's my my other family but the um in that now with that in mind just to stimulate some thinking wow maybe maybe the whole birthday thing is uh is where the problem is now let's look at christ's birthday the new testament does not mention any celebration of christ's birthday like an anniversary or continued celebration of christ's birthday we do recognize in scripture as we read in luke chapter 2 that on the day of his birth and as the scriptures com walk us through the chronology of christ's coming that only the story is told of announcement conception birth and these details are still told in the way of a story but as the chronology unfolds you don't find a moment going forward where there's any celebration of christ's birthday we call it nativity a nativity celebration or christmas different words that we might use for christmas it's not mentioned at all in the book of acts so we have the um acts of the holy ghost through the disciples and the apostles we don't see a christmas celebration it's not mentioned in any of the gospels other than the description and the chronology of his birth there's not a subsequent moment where his birthday is celebrated and then in the gospels or the book of acts which kind of formed the real meat of the chronology of christ and the disciples there's no date exact date given for when christ was born it's not even explicitly mentioned what time of year a real direct reference to the time of year there's certain things that you can draw from it and ways that you can begin to piece things together but it's not that it doesn't say in the in 6 bc in springtime on the 15th of nassau christ was born being like what the bible says he was born on this date in the spring it's kind of absent in that there's actually no early christian writings that mention the celebration of christ's birth you don't find that paul was celebrating it nor irenaeus who is a disciple of polycarp in these contemporaries you don't see any mention of paul i realize these church-age messengers you don't see them celebrating the birth of christ and i found this thought this is just a thought that came to me you have a lot of prophecies that point forward to the birth of christ scriptures then that kind of gather up the prophecies of his birth so you have scriptures in the old testament pointing forward the new testament kind of begins with the summation of that the climax of that but then going forward now from that moment on there's no scriptures in the new testament pointing backwards i found it very interesting and i think it's it we recognize that there's a lot of scriptures pointing forward but then once it's fulfilled there's really none pointing us back to say this is a moment that must be honored or revered or celebrated or or there's no subsequent mentioning paul is not writing in third corinthians you know and remember december 25th or remember this or remember that we don't find these things being emphasized there is we could say very safely no biblical commandment to celebrate christ's birth could we agree on that is that something that maybe is a safe area to be no biblical commandment no scripture that tells us that christians celebrate the date of christ's birth or to celebrate annually or at any time at all the birthday of christ now there's a parallel to this again i'm just trying to stimulate thinking the same is so with easter i'm just saying this to stimulate thinking and to be balanced there's a parallel of christmas celebrations and also the celebration of easter an easter celebration is not mentioned in the bible at all just as there is no prescription to celebrate christmas there is no scriptures that specifically mention the honoring and celebrating easter the date of the resurrection now i'll come to it hopefully here in a little bit there's a lot of myths associated with easter too a lot of traditions associated with easter but there's no command given to the church to annually celebrate the resurrection wait we don't find that in the bible so i say that to cause the balance and say well there's no place in the scripture at all where we should celebrate christmas and but we wouldn't want to get dogmatic about that because there is no scripture in the bible that tells us that we must celebrate easter and so we could say in one sense if you want to be consistent then just start throwing them all out and guess what some people have there's theologies and schools of thought in groups and cults that have completely banished every holiday every celebration birthdays easter christmas you name it none of those things and they've done it for the sake of sanctifying their children and staying far away from paganism um but we are not trying to fit into some sort of man-made uh sterilized environment that's going to keep us free from all these things because what happens when you build up a lot of barriers to try to protect people and it's man-made eventually you just protect them you're insulating them from truth that can change their lives now in the two separate questions we came up with the origins of celebrating christmas and christ's actual birthday they kind of collide these two separate questions begin to collide on with the subject of december 25th and it's really fascinating we do not i would say that i speak for all of us when we say that we do not believe that jesus christ was born on the day december 25th like we have a birthday we have a birth certificate there's a lot of different ways that our actual birthday can be memorialized and we believe that we were born on that day and it's in that way that we have some sort of we have this understanding what a day of birth day is but there's no uh we do not believe that christ was born on the actual day of december 25th or we don't believe he was even born in the winter so that kind of takes care of part four i think it is we want to revisit it again because it's interesting to look at it but there's so much debate and scholarship volumes and volumes of writings and studies and uh papers and articles and comments commentaries and volumes of books that have been written debates that have been had on the subject and there's a lot of attempts to kind of trace the history of this is where we are and these are the pieces we have to work with is there a way that we can use this and work backwards and use history and use all these different things to try to pinpoint and come up with a particular date when christ was born and what's fascinating when you really begin to take a deep dive into it and you begin to read a lot and read a lot and read a lot and try to find where people are coming from and what kind of evidence there is knowing exactly what brother branham taught you find that christmas and the birthday of christ don't seem to have been a concern to the early church like the early christians in the early church which was god's first church and the believers walking and the truth of the word of god it doesn't seem to have been much of a concern to them because you don't find in their writings and their debatings and their discussions you don't find the question coming up but what day was he actually born it's almost as if it had been over overshadowed by the purpose of his birth and not having such gained the preeminence to the early church because it's not until the second century that there's even a record of interest in the birth or the birth date of christ not until 100 years later after the birth of christ in the second century the hundreds of years after the church has been born that you actually find recorded interest of when was he born and and what date was he born on and it's not until the fourth century so this is the fourth century that we find references to the two dates that are celebrated now for christmas and is that that may be a revelation to some people there's actually two dates uh that were celebrated for christmas december 25th in the western roman empire in january 6 in the eastern so if you convert after the 25th to the eastern then you could have two christmases right it's still celebrated today by many january 6th especially at the time in the fourth century see december 25th in the western uh roman empire but then in the eastern especially like in egypt and in asia minor they celebrated christmas on january 6. there's a lot of reasons why they pinpointed those dates it's december 26th that stuck for most christians and then january 6 kind of became a separate feast a feast of epiphany that even some christians i think even the amish celebrated on the 25th but then the sixth is the feast of epiphany it's another uh special observance and christmas festivity and if you count the days between the 25th and the 6th that's the period that became known as the 12 days of christmas and all the weird gifts that were given on those 12 days that's where we get the 12 days of christmas is that period between the 25th and the 6th it's 300 years nearly 300 years after christ is born that people begin to widely observe christ's birth in mid-winter it's it's not like the early church you know you read in the book of acts and it says it was december 25th and we all got together for an ugly sweater party and white elephant gifts or whatever they would have given at the time there's this is not happening in the early church it's not even happening within the christian church it's not even happening on a broad scale it's not until 300 years after his birth that you begin to see christians or people wildly observing on a broad way christ's birth in mid-winter in this december january time period and there's a lot of theories as to why they started doing it a lot of theories you think there's just one there's just one reason there's only one reason why that came to be there's a lot of theories but the most well-known even outside of message understanding and message teaching the most well-known theory as to why december 25th in this mid-winter time was chosen for the celebration of christmas is that the dates were borrowed from pagans that there was a conscious decision made even in the three uh the third century that we are going to celebrate christmas on this date to align ourselves with paganism and truly the romans had a midwinter festival to saturn saturnalia it was celebrated in late december and throughout history there was a lot of other pagans and pagan religions that kept holy days or holidays or observances and feast around the same time so there's a lot of pagan activity going on during that time could we not just all agree pick a day any day there's some pagan stuff going on right i mean no matter what the pagans are up to something every day of the year throughout all history and so it's not like you can find this this is a holy day the devil's took the day off we get to claim april 16th this is the day like this is awesome this is great no there's there's pagan rituals there's pagan festivities there's events and circumstances and remember the devil is a great impersonator great a defiler and there's a copy and a mimicry that takes place if there's a truth the devil's impersonating the false copy and so you're always you're going to find this and we talked about it in the faith of abraham how that coming out of babylon and in genesis chapter 11 and it's the birth of all false religions and polytheism and it taints everything throughout history so no matter what it is you're going to find some sort of connection back to paganism or you can make one building altars is associated with paganism and throughout the life of abraham my goodness this guy is one altar building dude did you know sacrificing your children was a pagan ritual and abraham has taken isaac up mount moriah to do a pagan thing seemingly not objecting at all do i have your mind do i have a thank you in a little bit how there's things that can be cast as pagan and associated with paganism that we just to meet us oh that's paganism but what abraham might have been doing could be cast in light of paganism because remember the devil's tactic again don't get nervous we're right we're just going to be right in the word of god it was in 274 a.d ireland a roman emperor established soul invictus the sole invictus feast notice the date of that this is in the year 274 this is well after the church has been established well after the birth of christ you could say 274 after christ a d that a roman emperor establishes the feast which is called the birth of the unconquered sun referring to the sun the birth soul invictus the birth of the unconquered sun it relates to this of the winter solstice time and he established this feast on december 25th and many of this viewed this roman emperor's proclamation as an attempt to create a pagan alternative to december 25th because december 25th by that time had begun to get some traction within the christian community amongst people that believed in christ and the christian religion at large to where there was many that started to observe during this mid-winter time that perhaps and they have these different reasons and they're not and a lot of the reasons in genesis had nothing to do with paganism they were looking at hebrew tradition and different things to fix this date and this point at which christ was born and i think i might get into it at a later time but it was at this time that some say that aurelian did this on purpose because now the 25th is starting to gain some traction within this religion and now the emperor says no december 25th is going to be the birth of the unconquered son as some sort of rivalry to the christian celebration but we know for a fact that constantine took the church the roman church and deliberate this was a deliberate thing that constatine did he deliberately begin to adapt pagan festivals in order to christianize them whatever rillian's purpose and mode of an objective was in creating this festival of the birth of the unconquered son recognize that that festival on the 25th that particular one was not before the birth of christ but came later almost 300 years later and then when constantine comes whatever these other pagan celebrations may be they could have been recent inventions at the time they could have been long held traditions and remember where we set today there's a lot of things that become a part of our mythology and we think america was founded with the slogan in god we trust it's been on the dollar bill since the day this country was founded you might want to look that up buddy right until the 50s you realize the pledge of allegiance was largely secular until the 1950s one nation indivisible with truth justice liberty what is it again you know the thing brock a card off confess whatever it is you know you know the thing it it it was it was that was the pledge of allegiance until the 1950s with this upswing of political activism within evangelism they added one nation under god right this was added later and in our minds we think my goodness we've always been a nation that put this thing on our dollar bill put this on our money and put this in our pledge of allegiance no it was something new it was it might have been a as a as a pushback against communism it might you look back at the things that were upswelling in motivating people at the time do christians need to have in god we trust on their dollar bill to feel that they're right do we need to be in a nation that's money it gives knowledge he recognizes god listen let him take in one nation under god of the pledge of allegiance it doesn't take any of my devotion to christ away i'm sorry if i'm starting to really get onto some of your your pet peeves when it comes to politics and your identity as an american christian but i would much rather just be a christian than anywhere i don't need to be an american christian i don't need in god we trust on the dollar bill she's lost she can put god on everything doesn't make her more christian anyways it was constatine that deliberately began to take these different pagan festivals and christianizing oh you guys celebrate this planet let's make that a festival to this martyr oh you guys celebrate this let's make this a festival to this saint and they begin to tear down the statues of greek uh greek mythology and others religion other religions and egypt and all over these babylonian gods and begin to put christian symbols in their place it was no longer the worship of some venus or some planetary god in the sky but it becomes the worship of a woman upon earth and then pope gregory very simple name old pope greg uh it was gregory the great rather so it wasn't just you know greg the great it was gregory the great he actually explicitly pronounced even in the extended kingdoms as it began to reach into the united kingdom and other regions of europe he specifically pronounced the commandment to not tear down pagan places of worship and these pagan temples and these pagan areas but to convert them into places of christian worship and he actually recommended explicitly recommended that pagan festivals be converted to a feast for martyrs so if they were celebrating a feast to jupiter you would change it and turn it into a feast of one that was a martyr for the cause of christ so i want you to recognize how it's the roman church now the catholic church that begins to intentionally take pagan symbolism and blend it in with christian practices brother ben says in the church age book as he writes now notice that constatine gave special feasts to the people they were the old pagan feast with new names taken from the church or in some cases christian rights were taken and abused with pagan ceremonies he took the worship of the sun god and changed it to the son of god instead of celebrating on december 21st which is when they used to celebrate the feast of the sun god they put it up to december 25th and called it the son of god's birthday and this is this is brother branham now recognizing this and you find that brother branham gives this credence too and i'm so grateful i could say this with just absolute perfect confidence and peace i'm so thankful for the message of the hour to shine light and give a balance because if you want to go figure this out on your own have fun have fun but i'm so glad the message of the hour kind of begins to steer us and highlight things and the holy spirit can help keep a balance in the word of god so i did brother branham is now identifying this shift and how constantine now takes this uh these few hundred years later and it begins to crystallize within the frame of christianity this blending in of paganism with christian ideas and christian thoughts and i i'll say this that the use of december 25th as the actual date of christ's birth or the date that christians are going to celebrate christ's birth may have started innocently but once the church begins to blend in this paganism and the church the roman church begins to take constantine takes these feasts and all these other elements begin to be added in it begins to pervert and confuse any truth that may have existed with respect to this honoring christ's birthday this this is something i know i'm stating the obvious but think about this there is a truth to the birth of christ we believe that christ was actually born and so there is a truth to the birth of christ that satan would love to obscure there's something symbolic in it there's something represented there's something literal that's taking place there's prophecies being fulfilled and satan would love to take the truth of christmas and obscure it and hide it with mythology so you have so many christmas myths you don't recognize the christmas mystery and all elements of christianity when you think about the pomp the circumstance the religion the theology in christendom today almost all elements of christianity let alone christmas have become wrapped up and hid behind so much it's not just christmas but it's religion period it's christianity period it's worship it's doctrine it's been wrapped and hid behind so much and we have to be careful that we don't let the pagan myths push us away from the christian truth if you wanted to start pinpointing paganism being blended with christianity you come up with a metric by which you're going to choose to reject and accept eventually you'd do away with christianity because the catholic church has so swallowed it up and turned it into idolatry that you would have to walk away from all of it if you were going to do it for the sake of staying away from catholicism you'd have to walk away from all that for the sake of saying i don't want to be stained with not even one ounce or one iota if anything that has some sort of pagan connection why because the truth has been perverted by the devil so the truth in some way is it has this lie near it mimicking it taunting it standing against it and so we have to be careful that myths don't push us away from truth not not that we would say christ was born in december but to be careful that we don't adopt certain principles and beliefs that cause us to be distracted from truth if i could say this and i i know again i'm going to be a little bit lengthy this morning at this point i know been right at an hour but let me say this because i want to read some things continue to read some things when the word exposes when the word of god is very clear about a pagan perversion brother about him right here thomas constantine just blending in christian things being blended in with pagan things december 25th kind of being moved to where it's soul invictus it's a celebrating of the sun god's birthday and not the son of god and it's kind of changed into the son of god's birthday and now the soul invictus is being blended in with christmas and these things begin to have this pronounced uh uh we know we can clearly see it when the word of god exposes this pagan affront this pagan perversion when the word exposes an air recognized it also reveals the truth that there's something that is going to help give us the balance because if all this gets torn down and truth isn't being highlighted then once that's kicked out we could just get thrown all the way to another side and we don't maintain a balance so the word when it exposes a rut it exposes multiple ruts often so that we can stay right in the perfect balance the devil is shrewd satan has been working on this agenda for 6 000 years even in heaven when it all be the rebellion began you have to recognize the shrewdness and the subtlety where satan knows if you can just pull put a stain or a stigma on the word of god it can keep people from coming to it just put a stain on it just put a stigma on it just try to find some way to to to make it controversial the radicalization myth for all of a sudden if you put this scarlet letter on it people like i don't have anything to do i don't know if i want to have anything to do with it and in doing so here he is the scarecrow trying to keep you away from the true thing you realize he does that to the open of the word he does that to whether or not certain scriptures were fulfilled by the message of the hour he does it to try to create there's certain things that the devil tries to do to try to keep you from believing the truth as we mentioned before about the parallels to easter there's a lot of easter myths there's a lot of easter myth many legends a lot of the legends and the elements that exist around the easter time are not even ancient traditions but things that were adopted in more modern times the last several hundred years like even with respect to rabbits and eggs these are things that yeah you find symbolism in other religions but its place and its part in easter celebrations are things that would be more recent as opposed to this is what they did but nimrod you know had an easter egg hunt at the time of the passover those things weren't happening then so but you do see the connections in the different parts it's not easter i know one of the myths is that easter is some sort of congregation or mispronunciation of ishtar or astarte or asteroth and you'll find that according to even in the word of god and even as you look at it historically that easter as far as a term is not directly the same word as ishtar astarte they're actually two different things the word easter it would be a germanic word there's ostra or yoster and it was which we believe to be and we recognize that there's a lot of evidence to back this up a fertility goddess the goddess of the spring the spring goddess and it's in german mythology that you find this yoster this austra this is the this is where you find the term that would be germanic if you put it in the anglo-saxon or english it'd be easter and she was the goddess of the dawn she was the bringer of light this is what she represented within within german mythology and it has german origins like this is where yoster easter comes it comes up within the german mythology and it's associated later with anglo-saxon mythology and this is after the birth of the church that this easter and this terminology and these words begin to be used but then you can trace it back in what it represents you could trace it back that her mythology originated in what the mysteries of babylon because in the mistress of babylon you see every religion in the world whatever hemisphere wherever you are you can always trace it back to the seeds that are sold in babylon so if there's a yoster in germany you can trace it back to enough to see that there's some way somehow that this false image and false idea began with polytheism after the flood when man got away from god man had always worshipped the true god and stayed true to god you would never need a goddess of fertility you would never worship venus you would never worship the moon you would never need to worship mythological characters so yes this is traced back to the mysteries of babylon and that's where that's the origin of the term easter but yet even before you find the term easter being used or even the origin of this german mythology yoster early christians celebrated the resurrection in other languages outside of uh german and and i think even within german they don't use the word easter for the celebration of what we call easter but it's pasca or some derivative of that word is the word that's used in other languages around the world they use a different word which is passover or paschal pascal lamb it's recognizing the resurrection of christ who was the lamb and they used the terminology of pasca or passover and early christians we say celebrated or honored or had a time where they recognized the resurrection polycarp did irenaeus did in their writings they're drawing it from even the practice and as they were taught by john to set aside and to honor this time this annual tradition of celebrating the resurrection and so the actual practice of recognizing the resurrection of jesus christ within the christian church had zero pagan connections are you still with me 11 35 but if you found conflict within the early christian church about easter as we might call it now or the passover the celebration of the resurrection the conflict was over whether or not they were blending in jewish feast which was obviously the passover with and jewish feasts and customs with our christian celebration the christians are now doing something to honor the resurrection because they believed it was during this time of the feast of the passover that christ was not only crucified and had that last meal with his disciples but he rose again on the third day in that time of the feast of the passover and so christians are now recognizing this special time period in in its recency to them and as the church begin to unfold in the book of acts and with john who's a disciple of christ and polycarp who is a disciple of john an irenaeus who learned are these these the church age messenger these things begin to take hold within the christian church they had this consciousness to honor this particular time knowing it was then that christ was resurrected and so many days later was was when the holy ghost was poured out but it had the symmetry to jewish feasts so if there was a danger you'd be like well are we allowing are we allowing certain things with respect to uh jewish traditions in jewish feast are we using these things kind of as an excuse to kind of blend in so notice what was the ratio the idea wasn't judaism is not paganism right but it was just a former light and they were very careful this was the heartbeat if you could catch this this was the heartbeat of the early church they wanted to stay away from paganism they didn't want to have anything to do with it at all and they wanted to be very careful that they weren't just making it jewelry plus or judaism plus they wanted to be sure this was newness of life and they were honoring the lord and honoring his pre-honoring his precepts and they were wanting to walk in the truth so that's where the conflict came from it's not until the first roman church the first church at rome that became the seeds of the roman catholic church in the absence of the disciples that got kicked out through political pressure and government expulsion that they started bringing pagan elements or myths into these celebrations and obscured the truth it's not until later after the first this roman church after it's already show it's already shown in church history that they would honor the day of easter or the day of the resurrection and then the the first church at rome began to blend in these other practices and start to get obscure it's not until later that the anglo-saxon or german term easter and the ideas of easter begin to mix with the resurrection commemoration so it wouldn't even have been a word used by the disciples but the bible does mention easter in one place did you know that in one place is easter mentioned in acts chapter 12 it's speaking of peter when he was put into prison he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people the word that's used here easter is used 29 times in the new testament 28 times it's translated to passover and for some reason in the book of acts chapter 12 verse 4 pasca is translated to easter in verse 23 it references the jewish feast of the passover and in every single translation i could find from the earliest to some of the most recent this word is not easter is not used but passover is used i think well why in the world would this happen well the king james virgin version of it which that's another funny thing i knew people that thought it was blasphemous that lebron james went by king james because they had elevated a translation of the bible to be like a precious phrase like he calls himself king james i mean like that's blasphemous it's like no king james was actually a king of england who authorized the translation and we just never mind it's awful i agree but it was a king of england that authorizes english scribes to translate pasca and when they're doing that instead of using passover they used easter and that's the only place you'll find the use of easter so really as christians we cannot find any justification within the new testament to say well there's it's okay to celebrate easter use the phrase easter or try to make easter some sort of spiritual christian word that holds some sort of precious significance to us if we're all we're looking at is the bible only thing we have is that some king was using easter as a justification for not allowing him to come forth so it doesn't cause problems with the jews during a time of a passover but this is what i want you to catch this is the most important part if you stayed with me this long this is what i want you to get catch satan's pattern this is where you begin to catch satan's pattern not that king james and his uh his translators or shakespeare whoever it was cause you know intentionally meant to cause this problem but the devil's job is to cause confusion the devil has wanted to blend in mystery babylon he's wanted to blend in this paganism why in order to change the focus we're taught commonly if he can't get you out on the one he'll get you out on the other if he can't get you on the world he'll get you in religion if he can't get you on drugs he'll get in some sort of fanaticism as it relates to religion and religiosity so he wants to change the focus he wants to create the extremes so that once you've created the extremes and you develop the sides then no matter which one you join you're in imbalance and he doesn't care which side you're on just as long as you're beyond those barriers you're not in the liberty he wants to create the imbalance again i'm just trying to stimulate thinking so that we can be balanced don't even know what part i'm on anymore brother branham now gives this very direct notice this because think about it this is what i want you to consider then satan's pattern is the way he works when the venerable polycarp heard that the first chris christian church of rome and this is where i draw this and actually was able to find it exactly in history how the roman church started blending in these things even prior to some of these pronouncements by constantine when the venerable polycarp heard that the first christian church of rome was involved in pagan ceremonies that had corrupted the truth of the gospel so you have the truth of the gospel now paganism tries to corrupt it it's not that you have paganism first and then the truth you have truth subsequently perverted by paganism he went there to implore them to change he saw them prostrate themselves before images named after apostles and saints he saw them light candles and burn incense on the altar he saw them celebrate the passover under the name easter where they elevated the disc shaped bread that honored the sun god and then they poured the wine out as a libation to the gods notice how he's bringing in these elements of the disc shaped bread to honor the sun god paganism is being blended in after the fact it wasn't paganism to celebrate the lord's supper but symbolisms begin to be introduced into it it's actually at the council of nicaea that the catholic church or the council of nicea changed the date of easter and tied it to the spring equinox that's why now you don't the easter doesn't always fall on passover or didn't always fall on passover because now it was a time that was strictly affixed to the hebrew calendar their feast days it would have been fixed to their um to their schedule of feast and therefore you would think that easter being connected with the passover would begin to follow it but then once the church instituted when easter was celebrated it got out of sync until later the hebrew hebrew elders and traditions affixed a standardized date even to the passover so now sometimes you have more of an overlap but it's not until it's not it's the church that affects the actual date of easter the catholic church the council of nicaea did it bibraham said they took the feast of astarte and called it the easter celebration wherein the christian is supposed to celebrate he talks about this after constantine where the christians supposed to celebrate the death and resurrection of the lord actually it was a pagan feast to astarte this is what it had become they took the feast that we see explicitly recorded to astrothestarte the feast that were in jeremiah and these babylonian traditions things that were an abomination and stints to god they now become to get blended in and mixed babylon is becoming mixed with christianity and this is what it had become this the symmetry between pagan feast now being laid over the top or christian feast being laid over top of these uh pagan feasts what be a conscious effort to try to blend them and they did it as an idea to promote christianity like hmm we have all these pagans we have all these people that really really love hip-hop if we just made our service more hip-hoppy right we just made christianity more like these things maybe more people would come out constantine is the one that invented the modern bible church he's the one that started started the hipster christian movement let's be more like everyone else and maybe it'll win them to christianity does god ever change his mind about his word even i know a pentecostal preacher all them started now giving a round kosher which means asterisk the moon god a kosher wafer say shut your eyes and take it if it hurts your conscience shut your eyes around wafer what does it mean we are taking a broken body jesus christ broken showing the truth of the lord's supper not a round mood and god ashtrayth who mary took the place of and the roman kosher is still around for the moon goddess not god because of the god he's making sure that asteroth is the goddess notice what's happening subtle symbols of idolatry christianity now being blended in with idolatry this is happening with respect to easter this is happening with respect to the lord's supper all these things now taking shape and forcing themselves on into these christian truths not that it has to be celebrated or not that it was celebrated in the new testament but these are things that we would say do we come to church on easter do we celebrate the resurrection do we have easter sermons do we have these different traditions that we relate to easter and the term easter now may be special to us as christians but what does it commemorate the time of the passover and the resurrection the time of the paschal lamb being crucified and resurrecting that's what we're recognizing there's no spiritual significance to the word easter scripturally but there's something special about that time and that holiday to us as christians but what's happening is paganism is trying to swallow the truth of easter celebrations that's what we see brother branham identifying the time of the lord's supper the time of the resurrection now what does it become eggs rabbits pastels dress your best wear hats and it's almost become that's the time people go to church when christmas and easter wow because it would be pagan to not serve god 365 and think all you got to do is go a couple days of the year and check the box again i'm wanting to stimulate your minds to think about it even when it comes to our celebrating the resurrection the devil is trying to put a lot of paganism right up next to it even with respect to taking the bread and the wine the devil's trying to put a lot of paganism right up against what to devour and consume and swallow the truth of these things how many of you know that brother branham held a sunrise service for easter notice what the bible says about in ezekiel chapter eight versus not about it but about sunrise services maybe ezekiel chapter 8 verses 15 to 16 just trying to bring a balance stimulate your minds then said he unto me this is the lord speaking hath thou seen this o son of man turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these he'd seen a lot and he brought me into the inner court of the lord's house here he is in the inner court and behold at the door the temp of the lord between the porch and the altar about five and twenty men and their backs toward the temple lord in direct contradiction to what they ought to have been doing their backs to the temple lord and their faces toward the east and they worship the sun toward the east where they all got together before the sun rose in the house of the lord turn their backs to the true worship and affix their eyes to their horizon in order to worship the sun as it rose it's the only scriptural place i could find a sunrise service and god called it the greater abomination of these other things i've just given someone ammunition right to say that sunrise services are an abomination to god but do you realize god even connects that practice of going to the temple the lord before the sun rises and then turning your back to the temple in recognizing the rising of the sun and the resurrecting of the sun and this is what the men were doing they were venerating the sun instead of the altar and this this scripture here could actually be used to preach against sunrise services and guess what how did i find it because there's people that preach against sunrise services and because of their fanaticism i would have never noticed that in the scripture but they're out there pounding the pulpit and all these heathers that get up on easter morning and celebrate a sunrise service they're going to hell and this is the scripture they use and you know what you get caught up in that vein you say you know what it is it is pagan to do it and next thing you know your prophet is having pagan services on easter and and participating in idolatry not because because you've made the pagan part the truth of it you notice what you do you make the pagan part the truth of it when the pagan parts to obscure the truth of it the message identifies the paganisms of these holidays whether it be easter christmas not to destroy the entire concept itself but to separate out the lies it's not done so that the paganism becomes the truth in other words christmas is a pagan holiday so that we make that the truth christmas is pagan but rather he identifies the paganism associated with easter he identifies the paganism associated with christmas so that we can take the paganism and say you're the lie and punt it and stay with the truth of it you recognize what satan would want us to do put a scarlet letter on it so that we go oh i don't want that at all that's bad that's no good and walk away from it because there's a lot of foods that we would never eat if we never got past the skin if we never got past the the husk never got past the outside and that deters the consumption of it i believe the devil all times just tries to put up so many prickly so many things on the outside so we just get rid of the whole thing brother brahman the message harvest time he says and so did second eve meet hers at nicaea gave it a denomination creed accepted dogmas instead of the word taken down pagan idols like jupiter and so forth and put up paul and barnabas took down the sun god and the moon god astrath the moon god with round kosher on it and made her being the mother of the sun god which is jupiter in change the birthday of jesus from april we're all nature where he was born under the ram because he was a ram and change that up to the sun god's birthday and the solar there where it makes one day notice how brother branham is now giving credibility to to this identification of now how the idea of christmas gets cemented with this association and now it's been completely removed from any idea of when christ was born but now it's kind of a front the birth of christ is a front for these other religions and paganism that lurks behind it he said there's one minute difference in the day when it passes on the 25th of december the sun god's birthday not the son of god and every one of us play santa claus he said every one of us do every one of us play santa claus and decorate trees and heathenism and things like that and then call ourselves christians what's the matter with the christian church these are the statements we're familiar with right and there's several other similar strong if not stronger statements about christmas as he makes these stimulus there's one thing we can safely conclude those things have no place in the church santa claus decorating trees all these elements do not become the focus of a church all these things that the prophet is identifying is not to take even these things that are corrective and make them part of our canon making part of our belief making part of our doctrine but it's him trying to identify pitfalls the ruts the extremes the things that can distract us the things that have been blended into certain truths he's saying look at what these things are and it's very challenging this is a strong statement that i believe we ought to be confronted with playing santa claus decorating trees heathenism things like that and we call ourselves christians he's saying you call yourself a christian evaluate your practices what's the matter with the christian church why because even the christian denominations and christian churches were being consumed with those elements that's what it was becoming and it has no place in the church these things aren't part of our theology i would even say to the extent that we are recognizing these things during this time period where we'll talk about santa claus we'll talk about christmas trees we talk about the date that christ was born these things don't form our basis for belief like if we were witnessing the word of god we wouldn't say let me start with christmas once we see babylon once we see idolatry being mixed with christianity we don't reject christianity we don't reject the truth of it what day is today of is it what day of the week is it sunday what sunday s-u-n day we are gathering as a christian church on the day of the sun s-u-n a day which is derived from hellenistic astrology or days of the week you know we have um service on wednesday is it wode is that the god some norse god that it's named after so we have church on sunday s-u-n day and we have church on wednesday which is another roman name given to these different days of the week and those are that's when we're coming to church every sunday the day of the son the son of the sky we come to church now are we doing it to be different than the jews who set onto the sabbath is that why we do it like we don't want to be like the jews we don't want to mix our customs with jewish customs so in order to differentiate ourselves from the jews that celebrate the sabbath sabbath what we do is we're going to celebrate it on sunday and so we're just doing it to be different from the jews are we doing it because of its pagan origins i mean even in coming to church on sunday if we wanted to we could all bear the scarlet letter well i'm just doing a healer and thing right let's just be honest paganism is everywhere in everything we come on sunday to out of a representation to honor the resurrection according to scripture i don't think i need to get into the different things but we would come on the first day of the week which to us would be sunday and a lot of other uh nations or we we call the end of the weekend in the western hemisphere whereas in a lot of other nations it's actually the beginning week where sunday is the first day of the work week and it's go strong go hard but for us as christians we recognize this as a day of rest the day of the lord the day to honor the resurrection the lord was resurrected this is our our scriptural basis this is the day of the week that they would have gathered together this is what began in the early church they gathered on sundays to honor the resurrection and sunday became a day that was associated with christian service guests who made it official that this was the day it became an edict that sunday was the day for worship in church brother constatine is the one that made it an edict and formalized sunday services as when churches together so would it be wrong to have service on a saturday night would it be wrong to not have service on sunday morning would that would be would that be wrong because there's there's churches out there that don't even have a sunday morning service they have a sunday evening service but we get real legalistic we get real dogmatic and we get become radicalized and we would write somebody off because of what time they have church or where they have church right and the seventh day adventist said they'd say where am i why am i here we don't reject sunday as a day that we come to church should we direct easter because of the pagan myths and idolatry that are mixed in with it should we completely write it off completely reject it what do we do with it as a church we don't have easter egg hunts right we don't lay an egg on the altar we don't make a big to-do about easter and make it all about these elements of mythology those aren't the things that are promoting promoted but what does the christian church try to do honor the resurrection again i'm just wanting you to think what do we do we separate the traditions and the foundations that are contrary to truth we separate if that has a basis in this if that's your tradition that we separate so that we can see the truth of it understand the true significance of these days we do the same thing with christmas the controversies musicians if you'd come the controversies and the myths become a distraction from the truth and where something that the early church didn't even concern itself with with celebrating christmas let alone they didn't even really concern themselves of when he was actually born they weren't getting together debating well i think he was born on january 6. i don't know i think it was december 25th i think it was this i think it was that they didn't even have the debates they weren't even preoccupied by it it's not until later that it begins because it become a source of conflict why in order to cause division in order to polarize and pull people apart you celebrate the birth of christ on the 25th we celebrated on the 6th our church needs to split over the fact that you celebrate it 12 days earlier than we do and that becomes a bona fide point of contention that allows people to split and you don't even find it in the scripture we'll take things that are rooted in mythology and will take things that were intended to be a balancer intended to be a caution intended to take us away from paganism intended to take our focus off the wrong things and we take it and we weaponize that and we try to use it to demonize and tear down other people or try to make ourselves feel better about ourselves again i said this i say this whether or not one celebrates christmas would be a personal decision right when i say celebrate christmas in the manner which is customary for our country lights on the houses lights on palm trees a christmas tree this exchanging of gifts the festivities make baking cookies christmas cookies the cards [Music] right everyone's gonna get you know shutterfly stock is just like through the roof right now because it's so easy now you know mail out the cars and everyone gets one and we do it because the season the time if there's a family that chooses to not hand out cards this time of year that's their decision and it doesn't mean they don't like you now if they hand it out to everybody else and not you maybe more it's more about you it's a yp your problem not their problem but there's no judgment in this people have different convictions and there's people who have a conviction that christmas is wonderful it's a favorite time of year and they enjoy things and they want to participate and they want to spend time with family and bake the cookies and make the house very festive and if somebody does that with as a as an own fam they want to do that you need to respect their personal decision to do that even if you feel that scripturally they're wrong or they're out of balance because you better keep the right balance because before you know it you'll use their christmas music to justify your worldly music well they do it in december so i guess it's okay if i do it the rest of the year and that's the danger because we start we start fixing value and putting people in this position these categories i'm just wanting us to be balanced this year but aaron where are we going to stand on this where are we going to stay on this let's not stand in the extremes as a church let's not put pressure from the pulpit on everybody you got to have a christmas tree [Music] or you shouldn't have a christmas tree let it be a personal decision let people decide let them get into the word of god let them guide him let it leave them let it let it do something to kind of lift them up or challenge them in their own ways because people are different spectrums they're in different places i'll just say it maybe we need to be less frivolous less festive right maybe someone just maybe we get too much caught up into it and the word of god is saying hey you know taper it a little bit scale it down a little bit take a step back think about it again don't get caught up in these different things going into debt and the commercialization and the pressure listen i feel like i should take a whole series on the pressure that we feel to buy extended family gifts hard enough to buy for a family of six let alone a family of 60. you know and you got all these brothers aunts cousins sisters and extended families and then their kids started having kids like do i buy them for the second cousin's second cousins you know they did can i get a witness it's pressure because maybe you know we this year we need to be a little bit more prudent a little bit more this is the funniest funny part this year we're just going to write cards we're going to do something very very simple we're not going to exceed a 15 budget and then week before christmas i went ahead and bought this i bought that i did this and it starts getting out of control what is it you start recognizing the pressures that are at work you start recognizing the the things that are taking place not because this is demonic this is this is of the devil and you're not even a christian if you're celebrating it you start to recognize distractions things that aren't expedient i can say this i want i kind of want to seed for where i'm wanting to go i think it's in part five or maybe part four that the message of the hour identifies the myths and removes them to make available to us the mystery [Music] and the message it is the rising of the sun it's going to end on this brother braham says not on the sabbath the seventh day but on the first day which we call sunday s-u-n day course that's a roman word which they called it the sunday for the sun god but how it is changed it can change right even if you look at it in terms of when they instituted the roman calendar the day of the resurrection would have been a special day to christians later on it's called sunday s-u-n day when the roman calendar is formalized and now it kind of bears this mark it bears the stain and they could get lost in all the history all the tradition all the theology all the arguments all the pagans that can get lost but brother man says oh how it is changed it's not s-u-n anymore it's the s-o-n-d-a-y the sunday that the corn of wheat god's first one up from the dead is to be waived over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of the seed of those that slept waved over the first day of the week on sunday he raised up waved goodbye and ascended upon high in the presence of the people he says oh but oh how it is changed that would be my desire this this time of year that if there be anything that we see the wrong way if we're in one rut or in the other red whatever rut we find ourselves in all but how it is changed to the perfect liberty of christ so that now i'm not seeing it from a polar i'm not seeing it in opposites i'm not seeing it through the prism that the devil would want to place over whether i see paganism or i'm seen through paganism oh how i want it to change and i believe the message of the hour changes it all because of the message of the hour we can celebrate the resurrection without stigma because of the message of the hour we can properly honor this christmas time of worship without stigma without paganism there's a way that we could do it because oh yeah that has paganism oh yeah that's pagan oh yeah s you win day oh yeah december 25th oh yes soul invictus yes christmas tree yes tinsel yes this yes that but oh how it's changed because then he gets on in the next paragraph he says talks about the revealing of the son of man because he says it's s-o-n day waved over the people he says the son of man s-o-n is waved over the people again in this time the s-o-n is waved again he says oh it changed from sabbath to sunday it changed from a roman day paganism babylonianism whatever it might be back to the real truth of the day dawning let there be light the epiphany the shining forth of the sun it changed to the christians though you may have an easter though you may have an s-u-n day though you might have a christ mass associated with it oh how it changes from the idolatry and the paganism to the real truth of it why because the truth reveals the myth when he opens up to us the mystery merry christmas let's stand
