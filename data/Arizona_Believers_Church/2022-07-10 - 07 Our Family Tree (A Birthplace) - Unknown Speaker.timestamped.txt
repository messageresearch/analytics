[0:00] the title today is a subtitle to the
[0:04] series we've been on called our family
[0:05] tree and I think this is the seventh
[0:08] service that we've been on this we might
[0:10] have had a half in there because a
[0:11] communion
[0:12] but our family tree and the subject
[0:14] today is a birthplace if you start with
[0:17] me in Genesis chapter 21 verse 33 this
[0:19] has been very familiar to us
[0:21] thus far and it says in Abraham planted
[0:25] a Grove in Beersheba and called there on
[0:28] the name of the Lord the Everlasting God
[0:30] this Grove this tamarisk tree as it's
[0:33] interpreted in some places was not just
[0:36] a sprig it was not just a tree but it
[0:38] meant something it was a Grove it's a
[0:39] place of hospitality and it was planted
[0:42] after the birth of Isaac who was the
[0:44] promised son and we've identified this
[0:47] through a number of services so I'm just
[0:49] mentioning that just to kind of maybe
[0:51] signal that a lot of this is building on
[0:53] some of the other things that we spoke
[0:54] on and it's a tree that symbolizes
[0:57] Christ and it's a tree that symbolizes
[0:59] family and even the family of Christ and
[1:02] our title is a birthplace so I just want
[1:05] to start there and now if you're waiting
[1:06] for me to start preaching I'm starting
[1:08] now but birthplace is a place of birth
[1:11] or origin it could be a town a country
[1:14] uh you know it and a city where one was
[1:18] born and just yesterday we were at a
[1:20] memorial service for brother Joe Dalton
[1:22] it's just a really beautiful service
[1:23] probably one of the best that I've been
[1:25] to whether Steve Dalton did a tremendous
[1:27] job in conducting the service and I I
[1:31] was think pondering even yesterday I was
[1:32] back at the place of my birth I was born
[1:34] in Flagstaff So when you say where's
[1:36] your birthplace where was your place of
[1:38] birth and often we're asked that
[1:39] question and we go back to where we were
[1:42] born and it stays with you you're going
[1:44] to be asked that question your entire
[1:45] life where were you born in and so it's
[1:48] your place of origin and in many ways we
[1:49] could call it a starting place where
[1:51] things begin
[1:52] and as we're looking at the subject of
[1:54] our family tree we've used the image of
[1:56] a family tree and a tree a family tree
[1:59] has to have some designated origin a
[2:01] place where it starts and there's
[2:03] different ways of how you can draw out a
[2:05] family tree and and chart your family
[2:07] but it's a family tree is basically
[2:10] detailing or listing and showing people
[2:12] who are born in some sort of line and so
[2:15] there's some sort of lineal descent we
[2:17] call it a lineage that's a line of
[2:18] descent it's a where you have an
[2:20] ancestor so you have to look at a
[2:22] beginning point and all those who come
[2:24] from that same line a bloodline some
[2:27] sort of relationship and uh to a lineage
[2:29] actually is literally a string or a line
[2:31] or thread and there's a couple examples
[2:33] I wanted to show you just to kind of
[2:35] give you the image I don't know how well
[2:36] these will render on the picture you
[2:39] could start with the first one I don't
[2:41] know how that you might be able to see
[2:42] this but in this example the way the
[2:44] family tree is drawn is it begins at the
[2:46] bottom and it might be and then from
[2:48] that place or that point of origin with
[2:50] this I can't remember if this is a night
[2:52] or something like that that we found but
[2:54] from this particular individual there
[2:56] comes from him a son or another son and
[2:59] they begin to chart it all out from a a
[3:01] the patriarch and then all those that
[3:04] descend after him and the next example
[3:06] it's done the same way it starts at the
[3:08] bottom and then it just grows up to the
[3:10] top so it starts with a root with
[3:12] something at the base and then the
[3:15] family tree is aligned there's this line
[3:17] that branches out this way there's a
[3:18] line that branches out that way and
[3:20] that's what a family tree designates
[3:22] we looked at Luke chapter 2 verse 4 it
[3:25] says Joseph also went up From Galilee
[3:27] out of the city of Nazareth into Judea
[3:29] undo the city of David which is called
[3:31] Bethlehem because he was of the house
[3:34] and lineage of David Bethlehem being the
[3:38] the place the birthplace it was where
[3:40] they were to return because that's where
[3:42] their line of descent originated that
[3:44] was the place they had to come back to
[3:47] and it held the significance to them to
[3:49] the point to where this is where they
[3:51] returned at a particular time to uh
[3:53] either whether it be for a census
[3:54] whether it be for taxes if it was to be
[3:56] to show yourself or to report this was a
[3:58] place that Joseph returned because he
[4:00] was of the house and line or dissent an
[4:03] ancestor of David
[4:05] looked in the scripture how that family
[4:07] even in the New Testament were of the
[4:09] family of God all named after Christ
[4:12] that patriot means lineage or Kindred
[4:14] and so it's a line running all back all
[4:17] the way back to the same progenitor the
[4:19] same father or common origin I want you
[4:21] to think about that thought the starting
[4:22] starting place in a birthplace becomes a
[4:24] point of origin and a common origin
[4:28] we show these images to you it may have
[4:30] been at the very beginning of this so it
[4:31] might be good just to re uh refresh it
[4:34] in Isaiah chapter 11 verse 1.
[4:36] says and there shall come forth a rod
[4:38] this is a this is a
[4:41] um springing up it speaks of a branch
[4:43] that speaks of a tree shall come forth a
[4:46] rod out of the stem of Jesse it's been
[4:48] cut down into a stump but there's going
[4:50] to come forth a new growth that's going
[4:51] to come forth a tree and the branch
[4:53] shall grow out of his roots are the
[4:56] pictures in that I thought there they
[4:58] are I didn't mean to put that with a
[5:00] animation I apologize but says there
[5:03] come out forth a rod out of the stima
[5:05] Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his
[5:08] roots now this is an artistic rendering
[5:11] artistic rendering of this particular
[5:14] scripture and they actually draw it to
[5:16] where there's a branch coming out of
[5:19] Jesse it's originated in him it's
[5:21] something that's growing from his bosom
[5:24] and then it's depicted then as growing
[5:27] forth and then Nathan comes forth or
[5:29] just all these other descendants are
[5:31] coming forth from from Jesse but then
[5:34] everyone that was born of him is
[5:35] represented in that tree and they say
[5:37] that this scripture is what originates
[5:40] the use of a tree to symbolize a family
[5:43] and all the descents it's this use is
[5:46] believed to be to believe to begin with
[5:49] this verse that this verse gave them the
[5:51] idea of the prior examples we gave it
[5:53] was from this verse to imagine uh Jesse
[5:56] as a stump something cut down and also
[5:58] new growth coming from him and growing
[6:01] up and all the sons that could be
[6:02] charted in that they used this scripture
[6:04] as the original and so there's this idea
[6:06] of the tree of Jesse and so the original
[6:10] use of the family tree as a some sort of
[6:13] schematic or representation of genealogy
[6:16] begin to be depicted as a tree of Jesse
[6:18] this is one of a very old uh piece of
[6:20] art I didn't draw it nor did Eliza even
[6:23] though she's a tremendous artist this is
[6:25] very very old and it depicts it again
[6:27] beginning at the base and at the bottom
[6:29] with Jesse and growing all the way up to
[6:31] where you have Mary with the with the
[6:33] baby Jesus at the Top This is a
[6:35] depiction of genealogy a line of dissent
[6:37] if you could see each one of these
[6:39] characters you might have to use your
[6:40] imagination but these are representing
[6:43] those who are in the line in the
[6:45] genealogy or the family of Jesse to
[6:48] represent this family tree because the
[6:52] promise was to come from the House of
[6:53] David
[6:55] and so in the subject of
[6:57] First Chronicles chapter five you want
[6:59] to begin to turn there I want to look at
[7:01] the the even the word genealogy which
[7:03] means line of descent actually means
[7:06] even pedigree which pedigree would be I
[7:09] don't know if it's French Pettigrew but
[7:10] the foot of a crane and the way that it
[7:13] Forks out and and how that represents a
[7:15] line of dissent it's a family's origin
[7:18] or lineage the pedigree of something is
[7:20] what do you come back to what do you
[7:21] what are you made of
[7:23] and this scripture uh has a lot a lot in
[7:27] it that we could get distracted by it
[7:29] but I just want to show how and there
[7:31] was a number of places we could have
[7:32] read how genealogy the Reckoning of
[7:34] genealogy comes up quite a bit in the
[7:36] Old Testament First Chronicles chapter 5
[7:38] verses 1 and 2. basically explaining why
[7:41] Reuben the firstborn is not mentioned
[7:44] first in
[7:46] the accounting of the lineage but now
[7:48] the sons of Reuben the firstborn of
[7:49] Israel for he was the first born but for
[7:52] as much as he defiled his father's bed
[7:54] his Birthright was given Unto the Sons
[7:56] of Joseph the son of Israel so genealogy
[8:00] dissent lineal descent those that come
[8:03] forth from a father is important because
[8:05] the firstborn held a significant place
[8:07] within the family and there's a lot that
[8:10] we could touch on especially I've posed
[8:13] this question before uh and I guess I'm
[8:16] going to be given the answer right now
[8:18] never mind I won't I won't I won't pose
[8:19] the question
[8:20] that keeps you in suspense doesn't it
[8:24] but uh as they this firstborn being the
[8:27] firstborn they had a a Birthright to an
[8:30] inheritance there was a double portion
[8:31] there were certain things that was
[8:33] reserved for the firstborn and so it's
[8:36] explaining why Reuben isn't necessarily
[8:38] mentioned first in the genealogy but
[8:41] it's showing us how important this place
[8:42] was and you'd want to know wait who was
[8:44] born first who's older I know in my
[8:46] family there's always some confusion as
[8:48] to the oldest son is that's me but the
[8:50] confusion stems from the fact that they
[8:52] had a second Son who's a junior
[8:55] and you don't normally have that usually
[8:57] the first son as a junior but there was
[8:58] a little bit of bartering going on as to
[9:00] how David became the name of my brother
[9:02] younger brother
[9:04] and so
[9:06] his Birthright was given to the sons of
[9:08] Joseph the son of Israel and the
[9:10] genealogy is not to be reckoned after
[9:12] the birthright so in the order of
[9:14] dissent even though he would be the
[9:16] firstborn his genealogy his place is not
[9:19] going to it's not going to be recorded
[9:21] and reckoned to him to get the
[9:22] birthright for Judah prevailed above his
[9:24] Brethren and of him came the chief ruler
[9:27] and we know that this is even speaking
[9:29] of Christ for he'll have to come for
[9:30] that but the birthright was Joseph so
[9:33] there's a it's showing that in this
[9:34] genealogy in this Reckoning this was
[9:36] something very important to the Jews and
[9:38] maybe I should have said that at the
[9:39] outset that's what I have in my mind as
[9:41] I look at this is I want you to begin to
[9:43] understand birth order and and and and
[9:46] and dissent and genealogy and how much
[9:49] it would have meant to a Jew that's one
[9:51] of the things I want to emphasize and so
[9:53] if you were to go back to First
[9:55] Chronicles chapter 3 and chapter 4
[9:57] chapter 5 it's given the genealogy of
[9:59] David's family
[10:01] from whom the chief ruler even this this
[10:03] tribe David coming from and this origin
[10:06] was extremely important
[10:09] I just even think of terms of the
[10:10] promise to Abraham going all the way
[10:12] back to Abraham it was unto Abraham and
[10:14] his seed but not just any seed right
[10:16] just couldn't be anybody whose father
[10:18] was Abraham but it had to be through uh
[10:20] it had to be through Isaac so you had to
[10:23] know who Isaac was and where his descent
[10:25] was and then whether or not you
[10:27] descended from Isaac because that's
[10:28] going to determine whether or not this
[10:30] land is yours whether or not the promise
[10:32] is yours whether or not Deliverance is
[10:34] yours whether or not the Messiah is
[10:35] yours and what rights and privileges you
[10:38] would have within the family it was very
[10:40] important to know I know who my father
[10:42] was and who his father was and then
[10:44] eventually they just kind of summed it
[10:45] up with what our Father Abraham
[10:48] that there we are of Our Father Abraham
[10:51] in Ezra chapter 2 verses 61 and 62 this
[10:54] touches again on just how in the natural
[10:57] how precise they wanted to be and how
[10:59] specific they needed to keep this
[11:01] dissent and this genealogy pure and of
[11:03] the children of the priests the priest
[11:05] of habbai the children of cause the
[11:07] children of marciah which took a wife of
[11:10] the daughters of barcelai the gileadite
[11:12] and was called after their name these
[11:15] sought their register among those that
[11:18] were reckoned by genealogy do I have a
[11:21] right to the priesthood can I serve as
[11:22] priests can I be traced back to Levi can
[11:25] I am I do I have the right kind of
[11:28] placing within the family by birth and
[11:31] the right kind of position in the family
[11:32] by birth in order to be positionally
[11:34] placed in my office according to my
[11:37] birth and it says but they were not
[11:39] found therefore were they as polluted
[11:41] put from the priesthood
[11:43] and so what what kept them out because
[11:45] they had Blended in with a different
[11:47] family they Blended in with a different
[11:49] lineal descent and it would hybrid and
[11:52] it would mix in and it disqualified them
[11:54] from being in the service so they sought
[11:57] their register among those that were
[11:59] reckoned by genealogy they were actually
[12:01] going back to the register the archives
[12:03] the written genealogy and like as a
[12:06] census and saying well this one was born
[12:08] to this one and this one was born to
[12:09] this one and this was born to this one
[12:10] and they tried to go back and see if
[12:12] they could trace
[12:13] their family tree
[12:15] back to a particular origin that would
[12:17] dictate yes I can serve in the
[12:20] priesthood
[12:21] so we thought ancestry.com and all those
[12:23] things had went on reminds me brother
[12:25] Matthew just how much we used to
[12:26] Fellowship years ago on your attempts to
[12:28] find family and all it says nothing new
[12:31] this is they've been doing this for
[12:32] thousands of years trying to figure out
[12:34] who's who and who's who and where do
[12:36] they all fit together
[12:37] and so
[12:38] the Jews meticulously preserved their
[12:42] genealogy
[12:43] and and even in the genealogy of Christ
[12:46] in the Book of Matthew in the Book of
[12:47] Luke what does it do it basically with
[12:49] Matthew it kind of goes in descending
[12:51] order to show you the genealogy of
[12:53] Christ and then Luke takes it the other
[12:54] way the the um the ascending order and
[12:57] both of them kind of trying to show look
[12:59] we can trace Christ back to his origin
[13:01] according to the promise that he would
[13:03] be from the root of Jesse he would be
[13:05] from the House of David he would come
[13:07] from the tribe of Judah
[13:09] and I came across some interesting
[13:10] references in history how that it's
[13:13] believed that Herod during the time of
[13:14] his rule destroyed the public records of
[13:17] the genealogies in the temple archives
[13:19] so in the temple there was an archive of
[13:21] genealogies so if someone came and said
[13:23] you know I'm a levite I want to be a
[13:24] priest I said well who's your father and
[13:26] they could go back and they could
[13:27] determine whether or not he actually
[13:29] would have that right or that privilege
[13:31] and these things are well preserved and
[13:33] Herod himself not being one in the in
[13:36] the club so to speak her and the family
[13:38] was jealous of the purity of these Jews
[13:40] and how much they could prove their
[13:42] their birth and their origin the story
[13:45] is and I'm not trying to set it forth as
[13:47] as an absolute but the story is that he
[13:51] destroyed the record of these
[13:52] genealogies so that no one could go back
[13:55] and look at it
[13:57] and and this was lost to the Jews
[14:00] and so kind of the the history is that
[14:02] the Jews then had to kind of configure
[14:04] their family tree by memory
[14:06] uh they had to go by other private
[14:08] records that may have been incomplete
[14:09] someone says well I visited the temple
[14:11] archive and I wrote down our genealogy
[14:14] and and I have it here this is who your
[14:16] great great grandfather was and this is
[14:17] the line they descended from and so they
[14:20] had to try to piece together their
[14:22] family tree
[14:24] and to to make out a proper line of
[14:28] descent must have must have been almost
[14:29] impossible
[14:31] to go back and try to figure out well I
[14:32] know who my dad is I know who his dad
[14:34] was and I know who his dad was but then
[14:36] it can start getting pretty murky
[14:38] and then they start trying to go back
[14:39] and piece it all together and this is uh
[14:41] this is why some speculate that Paul
[14:43] referenced these things in first Timothy
[14:45] and Titus Chapter 3 first Timothy
[14:48] chapter 1 verse 4 neither give heed to
[14:50] fables and endless genealogies which
[14:53] minister questions rather than Godly
[14:55] edifying which is in faith so do begin
[14:59] to Titus but avoid foolish questions
[15:00] Titus 3 9 avoid foolish questions what a
[15:04] great great admonishment avoid foolish
[15:07] questions and genealogies and
[15:09] contentions and striving about the law
[15:11] for they are unprofitable and vain
[15:16] now I know you're saying oh brother
[15:17] Aaron you've kind of put yourself in a
[15:19] box because you've just spent a lot of
[15:20] time on genealogies well they're not
[15:23] endless it's not going to be endless but
[15:25] it's referring to just how much the
[15:28] actual natural record who my daddy was
[15:30] and who my grandfather was and who my
[15:32] great-grandfather was and all the pride
[15:34] that they would put in that family and
[15:36] their family name and this was important
[15:38] to a Jew in order to establish
[15:39] themselves
[15:41] so to be Vindicated to feel that they
[15:43] had a right in the promised land to have
[15:44] some sort of confidence in their
[15:45] position they would try to arrange it by
[15:48] who their line of descent and where they
[15:50] came from we are of Our Father Abraham
[15:51] as they say and we descend from this and
[15:54] we descend from that and Paul's saying
[15:55] these endless genealities and this
[15:57] contending about these lines of dissent
[15:59] are unprofitable in vain
[16:03] because he's introducing it we want to
[16:05] we're kind of pointing to it now he's
[16:07] introducing something else that means
[16:08] more
[16:10] but to a Jew your birth your natural
[16:13] birth was so prominent and so preeminent
[16:17] and so to be a part of the family tree
[16:19] to actually be a part of these records
[16:21] is they would be fighting about
[16:23] genealogy it wasn't something you could
[16:24] just be admitted into something very
[16:27] real something very natural you had to
[16:29] have been born of the same bloodline yet
[16:32] the proof paternity
[16:33] and so I've already mentioned this to
[16:36] the Jews you want to look at Luke
[16:37] chapter 3 to the Jews uh they're natural
[16:39] lineage back to Abraham was their
[16:41] bragging rights
[16:42] something that meant a lot to him so
[16:44] notice how John the Baptist even
[16:46] addresses this in Luke chapter 3 verses
[16:48] 7 to 9 then said he to the multitude
[16:50] that came forth to be baptized of him oh
[16:53] Generation of Vipers
[16:56] what is he he's he's kind of punching at
[16:58] this idea of who they descend from we
[17:01] are of Our Father Abraham and we have
[17:04] Abraham Our Father we descend from
[17:07] righteous Isaac we have Jacob we're sons
[17:09] of Israel and he says oh no you generate
[17:12] of your Generation of Vipers who hath
[17:14] warned you to flee from the Wrath to
[17:16] come bring forth therefore fruits worthy
[17:19] of repentance and begin not to say
[17:20] within yourselves and this just to me
[17:22] reinforces how he knew as soon as he
[17:25] called him Generation of Vipers they
[17:26] would have an object an objection we
[17:28] have Abraham to our father
[17:30] says don't don't even start
[17:32] don't even start to say oh well we come
[17:35] from Abraham we come from Isaac he's
[17:36] saying you need to repent it doesn't
[17:38] matter who your father was it doesn't
[17:40] matter who your grandfather was it
[17:41] doesn't matter if you can go all the way
[17:43] back to Abraham you need to repent for I
[17:45] say unto you that God is able of these
[17:47] Stones notice to raise up children unto
[17:51] Abraham
[17:52] that maybe whoa that escalated quickly
[17:56] um you don't need to get so extreme
[17:57] brother John that's kind of ridiculous
[17:59] raise up stones but he's trying to make
[18:00] a point you lay so much on your natural
[18:03] claim but God can supernaturally bring
[18:06] forth children of Abraham
[18:08] and then notice this statement should
[18:10] not should make more sense within
[18:12] context and now also the ax is laid into
[18:14] the root of the trees and another place
[18:16] that says the root of the tree
[18:18] so what has he done he's taken all their
[18:20] little family trees he's like
[18:22] chopping it down
[18:25] taking all
[18:26] Generation of Vipers oh no no look at my
[18:29] family tree chops it down another person
[18:32] that says oh no no what about my tree
[18:33] chops it down they're saying oh well at
[18:35] least Israel stands no I'm chopping the
[18:37] whole family tree down
[18:40] the tree represented the Jewish Nation
[18:42] it represented natural lineage
[18:45] and what was what was soon going to
[18:46] happen they were all going to be
[18:47] dispersed
[18:48] right the destruction of Jerusalem all
[18:50] the seedlings all the trees cut down and
[18:53] Scattered and destroyed Jerusalem
[18:55] destroyed the Seed of Abraham the seed
[18:57] of Isaac all scattered out in the
[18:59] despour all spread out and what was
[19:01] going to happen Israel as a nation was
[19:02] going to be chopped down to a stump but
[19:04] what was going to rise
[19:06] Christ a new family tree
[19:09] and so he's talking about them as trees
[19:11] represent even individuals being part of
[19:12] that tree he says Act is being laid to
[19:14] the root of the tree this was their the
[19:16] Isaiah 11 looming so large in their
[19:18] minds we have this genealogy that can be
[19:21] reckoned this makes us who we are this
[19:24] is this is what my identity is wrapped
[19:27] up in
[19:28] now in John chapter 3 verses 1 to 3
[19:33] . I'm actually going to want to read to
[19:34] verse 9 but then I'm going to I'm going
[19:36] to enter
[19:37] kind of poke in here just a little bit
[19:39] with some other things
[19:41] I hope that in coming to this you can
[19:44] begin to see this scripture in a whole
[19:46] new light
[19:47] maybe maybe just more light just more
[19:50] pronounced more Vivid
[19:52] um there's I I said this kind of comes
[19:55] in my mind in terms of
[19:56] of what I'm meaning you know some of you
[20:00] may have seen some of the videos of
[20:01] people who are colorblind and then they
[20:02] put glasses on they're adults they live
[20:04] their whole life being colorblind and
[20:06] they've done well for themselves right
[20:07] they put a pair of glasses on them and
[20:09] they begin to weep they begin to cry
[20:11] they're moved because they realize I
[20:12] could always see enough to get by and be
[20:14] very successful and live a full life but
[20:16] then all of a sudden it jumps out and
[20:19] Technicolor it's it's it's it's
[20:20] different and it's and it's
[20:22] revolutionizing it's still seeing the
[20:24] same thing but they see it more vividly
[20:25] that could be perhaps what I'm referring
[20:27] to here I even know sometimes we don't
[20:29] realize that we need glasses then you
[20:31] borrow somebody else's like whoa hold on
[20:34] wait a minute I need to go get my eyes
[20:36] checked well I'm I want you to the Lord
[20:38] is trying to loan you some glasses today
[20:40] maybe so you can say all right Lord this
[20:42] is the eyesight I want to see I want to
[20:43] see these things better there's always
[20:44] more definition we can get so in John
[20:47] chapter 3 verses one to three there was
[20:49] a man of the Pharisees important to know
[20:51] he was a Pharisee named Nicodemus a
[20:53] ruler of the Jews so he's a ruler he's a
[20:56] fair Mercy he would be able to be
[20:58] reckoned in the genealogy he's a ruler
[21:01] of the Jews so he would be of a certain
[21:02] pedigree the same came to Jesus by night
[21:06] and said unto him there's a reason why
[21:07] he did it at night because he was a
[21:09] Pharisee because he was a ruler and said
[21:11] to him Rabbi we know that thou art a
[21:12] teacher come from God
[21:15] I don't know if he's using the Royal we
[21:16] there or if his is truly another a group
[21:19] of rabbis or if they knew amongst
[21:21] themselves or the Pharisees themselves
[21:23] knew hey this isn't good for us but we
[21:25] know he's the real deal
[21:26] but it says we know that there are a
[21:28] teacher come from God for no man can do
[21:30] these Miracles that thou doest except
[21:32] God be with him
[21:33] now if you if you heard that
[21:36] on you and someone told you say yeah
[21:38] Nicodemus was hanging out with Jesus
[21:40] last night at Dutch Brothers and uh and
[21:43] he paid him a really really big
[21:44] compliment and he said you know what you
[21:46] are you are definitely from God because
[21:48] no man could be doing these things
[21:49] except to be from God and and Jesus said
[21:52] you're welcome
[21:53] no he answers instead of verily verily I
[21:56] say unto thee except a man be born again
[21:57] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[22:00] I I want you to realize that just what a
[22:02] what a
[22:05] I want to say just like a blast but
[22:07] something that just kind of rips the
[22:09] needle off the Record
[22:11] and it kind of maybe gets into the heart
[22:13] of Nicodemus because he's wrestling he's
[22:15] coming at night because there's a rabbi
[22:16] we know that you're a teacher that's
[22:18] come from God you're performing Miracles
[22:19] God has to be with you because what
[22:22] we're seeing uh we see you is doing
[22:24] things that only God could do and so
[22:27] Jesus's answer seems to me uh to kind of
[22:31] be incongruent to the compliment
[22:33] because Jesus doesn't say oh thank you
[22:35] I'm so glad I'm so glad that you've
[22:37] noticed and yes yes Nicodemus I am sent
[22:40] from God I am the Messiah I'm he who is
[22:42] prophesied to come to the world he takes
[22:44] it to a whole nother level with
[22:45] Nicodemus the Pharisee who can see
[22:47] things with his natural eye
[22:49] he says verily verily I send you
[22:51] extended thee except the man be born
[22:53] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[22:56] this is where I begin to think about
[22:58] those that are wanting to be baptized
[23:00] and those of you who don't know it yet
[23:02] who are going to be baptized this is
[23:03] where it all begins in this
[23:05] acknowledgment that a man must be born
[23:07] again
[23:08] and when Jesus says born again there's
[23:10] actually a lot of translations that
[23:12] render it Born Again from above because
[23:15] to be born again is to be born Anew and
[23:17] put into relationship with God as your
[23:19] father so it's a Heavenly birth not a
[23:21] natural birth he's not saying that oh
[23:23] you were born in Flagstaff Arizona oh
[23:25] well you need to go back and be born
[23:26] again you have to re you go through the
[23:28] whole process
[23:29] and and so to say to a Jew to be born
[23:33] again this begins to really pick out a
[23:36] sore spot
[23:38] because in Matthew chapter 23 verse 15 I
[23:40] just want to reference this hoping to
[23:41] come back to it later I realize I'm
[23:43] running out of time I have to go much
[23:44] faster I want to describes the Pharisees
[23:45] Hypocrites for the Encompass the sea
[23:46] land woven to you scribes and Pharisees
[23:48] Hypocrites for you Compass the sea and
[23:50] land to make one proselyte you hear this
[23:53] word a lot make one proselyte and when
[23:56] he is made you make him twofold more
[23:58] than the child of Hell than yourselves
[24:02] I don't know why he does it but Jack
[24:04] goes around all the time now saying sick
[24:05] burn and I would say in this case yes
[24:10] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[24:12] Hypocrites for you can pass sea and land
[24:14] to make one Prospect one convert
[24:16] a prostate was a gentile who converts to
[24:18] Judaism one who is prosely is one who
[24:20] has come over right they were on the
[24:22] wrong side now they've come over Red
[24:24] Rover Red Rover let the Gentile come
[24:26] over and he makes it over and he's now
[24:29] you've you've kept him and you've held
[24:30] him in the line and and now he has to
[24:32] become one of you and he says you you
[24:34] you can pass see in land
[24:37] you you're striving so hard to make a
[24:40] convert to your religion and all you've
[24:43] done is you've made them a double child
[24:44] of hell
[24:46] a twofold a double portion that means a
[24:48] lot to a to a Jew but he says you
[24:50] haven't made him more righteous you've
[24:52] made a more unrighteous he's a twofold
[24:54] more child of hell because you are
[24:56] hypocrites scribes and Pharisees who do
[24:59] everything you can to get someone to
[25:01] come over and he says you're just making
[25:02] them worse
[25:04] now this when Jesus is referring to a
[25:07] proselyte I use this scripture in
[25:09] particular just to identify how the Jews
[25:12] had a concept of being born again
[25:15] in relation to these converts in
[25:17] relation to a proselyte because a Jew
[25:20] believed when a gentile became a
[25:22] proselyte they were like a newborn child
[25:25] now why would they have to imagine that
[25:28] because they in their literal Birth by
[25:31] coming up and come out and crying by
[25:34] their natural birth they are a Jew
[25:37] they and they have every right and
[25:39] privilege under Judaism they're born
[25:40] naturally into this religion so when a
[25:43] gentile would convert they had to kind
[25:45] of come they had to have this idea that
[25:46] yes he is as if he's been born Anew
[25:49] because now he is going to partake in
[25:51] certain rights and privileges as a
[25:53] proselyte and so to them this birth was
[25:56] uh it was something we could say as
[25:59] Christ identifies it so I'm getting
[26:00] ahead of myself this birth was from
[26:02] below it's from the earth of natural uh
[26:05] water blood and life
[26:08] brother Brown says and who is this
[26:09] Melchizedek I'm just referring to it
[26:11] very quickly the natural birth is in
[26:12] three what's the first thing that
[26:14] happens to a woman having a baby what
[26:15] breaks first water what breaks next
[26:17] blood what's the next process Life water
[26:19] blood spirit takes that unique approach
[26:22] to these three uh agree on Earth the
[26:25] water blood and spirit and he actually
[26:27] shows how there's a connection and a
[26:29] type to the Natural birth and that
[26:31] and so to a Jew when they prosely
[26:33] someone they think about their process
[26:35] of becoming a Jew which happened by
[26:37] being born literally
[26:39] so then when one converted there's this
[26:42] idea that they've been as a newborn
[26:44] child they've entered into our religion
[26:47] in Ezekiel chapter 16 verses three to
[26:50] four
[26:51] as I was studying this last week I was I
[26:54] thought man this is such an interesting
[26:55] scripture
[26:57] and so and
[26:58] it just in coming across it it just was
[27:01] very very inspiring to me and say thus
[27:04] saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem
[27:07] Jerusalem this is Zion this is this Most
[27:10] Holy City thy birth and thy Nativity is
[27:12] of the land of Canaan
[27:14] so now it's it's bringing it lower
[27:18] thy father was an Amorite thy mother a
[27:20] hittite oh these are fighting words
[27:23] and as for thy Nativity thy origin thy
[27:26] birthplace your beginning in the day
[27:28] that I was born thy navel was not cut
[27:30] what does that mean you don't cut the
[27:32] navel you don't tie it up this is
[27:33] certain death
[27:34] neither was thou washed in water to
[27:36] Supple the Supple there means to cleanse
[27:40] and that was not salted at all nor
[27:41] swaddled at all all these different
[27:43] things talk about the Nativity the thy
[27:46] birth and Nativity thy birthplace is is
[27:48] Canaan your origin is an Amorite and a
[27:51] hittite that Nativity the day you're
[27:52] born your navel was not properly cut you
[27:54] were not washed in water to be cleansed
[27:57] you were not salted which they said
[28:00] would cause the skin to firm up and you
[28:01] were not swaddled which would be
[28:03] necessary for the appropriate coming
[28:05] together of tendons and bones and and
[28:07] then the swaddling the proper growth of
[28:09] the child so there's a lot that's being
[28:10] imagined in this statement but I just
[28:12] want you to realize the language of God
[28:14] to Jerusalem and the things that a Jew
[28:16] would do to a baby when they were born
[28:20] and so there was even
[28:22] I don't want to get lost in this but
[28:24] even in the law there was the ritual of
[28:27] purification by immersion in water
[28:29] that there you see it in several
[28:31] different places the priests and
[28:32] different ones who were unclean they
[28:34] would immerse themselves in water if
[28:36] they were defiled if you were defiled
[28:38] according to the law there were certain
[28:39] rituals of purification that you would
[28:41] Undertake and there would be a bath
[28:42] where you'd be immersed in it and it
[28:44] would be being you'd you'd be defiled
[28:47] you would bathe yourself and be immersed
[28:49] and you'd be considered Changed by
[28:51] virtue of going into that water
[28:53] and think about some of the things that
[28:55] the law would say you you
[28:57] um would defiled you you're just kind of
[28:59] talking to your buddy and you're kind of
[29:00] yeah you know it's been a really long
[29:01] day you're like you got your hand on a
[29:03] Sepulcher there buddy you're like oh
[29:06] excuse me didn't notice that I've been
[29:08] defiled and you say well where's the
[29:10] defy I mean it was how is he defiled
[29:12] well then in order for him and I'm not
[29:14] sure if it actually is in relation to
[29:15] touching something but there's things
[29:17] with bed sheets and other things that
[29:18] you'd be considered unclean and defiled
[29:21] and you'd have to go in in the mythka
[29:23] and you'd have to be washed and immersed
[29:25] through a ritual purification and they
[29:26] would consider you defiled before you
[29:28] went in the water undefiled and you came
[29:30] out Changed by the water
[29:33] and so it were restored you'd actually
[29:36] be restored to back to certain
[29:37] Privileges and rights you could return
[29:38] to office you could return to this you
[29:39] could do that
[29:41] and so I'm mentioning that because when
[29:44] Jesus as Jesus is going to go forward in
[29:45] John chapter 3 Nicodemus is a Pharisee
[29:49] and he says in Matthew chapter 23 the
[29:52] Pharisees they make one proselyte and in
[29:55] making a proselyte they they they they
[29:59] make one to be born Anew and they had
[30:01] these images in the natural I'm still
[30:03] I'm still in Ezekiel 16. they have this
[30:05] uh this position in the natural Nativity
[30:08] and birth and all these different
[30:09] elements so a Jew by their natural birth
[30:12] a Jew by their natural birth identified
[30:14] themselves with the promise
[30:17] I bet my court has been cut I've been
[30:19] swaddled I've been salted I've been I've
[30:22] been suppled my Nativity is in Jerusalem
[30:26] and there would be no need for a Jew to
[30:29] be born again right no need at all for a
[30:32] Jew to be born again
[30:34] so in John chapter 3 verse 4
[30:38] Nicodemus saith unto him or you
[30:40] understand his position and why he's
[30:41] objecting how can a man be born when he
[30:43] is old
[30:46] can he enter the second time in his
[30:48] mother's womb and be born
[30:51] now if Nicodemus had perhaps heard Jesus
[30:55] say this to a gentile maybe he
[30:57] rationalizes it and he's like that's
[30:58] right that's right he needs to be
[31:00] changed he needs to convert to Judaism
[31:02] he needs to accept our principles and
[31:03] our laws but he is saying this to a Jew
[31:06] and a Jew could not conceive the need to
[31:09] be born anew
[31:11] because their identity was so rigidly
[31:13] fashioned and natural Linus to Natural
[31:15] pedigree their first birth was all it
[31:17] took that's what made them who they were
[31:19] and that's what they were so concerned
[31:21] with so his objectives how can a man be
[31:23] born again when he is old can he enter
[31:24] the second time in his mother's womb and
[31:26] be born and maybe to Nicodemus he's
[31:28] thinking into my I need to go back and
[31:30] be born by the same father and mother
[31:32] again that's ridiculous the I'm going to
[31:35] be the same one that I was when I came
[31:37] forth because I'm a Jew I'm a Jew of
[31:39] Jews I'm a Pharisee what's the need
[31:41] what's the point of being born again
[31:44] and Jesus hits it in verse 5 verily
[31:46] verily I send it except the man be born
[31:49] of water and of spirit he cannot enter
[31:52] into the kingdom of God that which is
[31:54] born of the flesh is flesh I kind of
[31:56] Taken Nicodemus saying you're thinking
[31:58] of the flesh I'm talking about the
[31:59] spirit that which is born of the spirit
[32:01] is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto
[32:04] thee ye must be born again notice the
[32:09] emphasis when Jesus said except a man be
[32:12] born again in other words he said ye
[32:14] must be born again so he says Marvel not
[32:16] when I said except a man be born again
[32:18] in other words I said you must be born
[32:21] again and that's exactly how Nicodemus
[32:24] took it because he was coming wait a
[32:25] minute why do I need to be born again
[32:27] and so he says it again the wind bloweth
[32:30] where it listeth thou heard here is the
[32:32] sound thereof but cannot tell whence it
[32:34] cometh and wither it goeth
[32:37] now to a Jew they could say I know where
[32:39] I'm standing right now Nicodemus so many
[32:41] years old and I can tell you who my
[32:42] father was who his father was I could
[32:44] tell you all the way back my point of
[32:45] origin I go back to Abraham and he's
[32:48] saying when the one that is when the
[32:49] wind blows
[32:52] you're not gonna be able to go back and
[32:53] find it in the temple archives
[32:55] so is everyone that is born of the
[32:57] spirit
[32:58] so this is this is a real large picture
[33:00] right that he's talking about there's
[33:02] there's a deep subject that he's dealing
[33:04] with with Nicodemus Nicodemus answered
[33:06] and said to him how can these things be
[33:10] that's an understatement right he is he
[33:13] is just his his head is exploding he has
[33:18] just been gut punched he is being told
[33:21] and reinforced
[33:23] that no
[33:25] Nicodemus you can trace who you are all
[33:28] the way back to Abraham it means nothing
[33:31] you need to be born again
[33:33] and you need to be born again by
[33:34] something you cannot see you cannot look
[33:36] up in a temple archive you need to be
[33:37] born again from above Christ is
[33:39] revealing the new birth from above the
[33:41] new rebirth by the Holy Spirit he's
[33:43] being said he's saying yeah you got a
[33:45] great first birth but there must be a
[33:48] second birth
[33:51] there must be a second birth that's why
[33:54] when we talked about the sycamore tree
[33:56] that salvation must be preached
[33:58] salvation must be made available if
[34:01] there's not salvation offered and we are
[34:03] not saved by that baptism of the Holy
[34:06] Ghost we are just a gathering of people
[34:07] today
[34:09] just to gather and we'd be better off
[34:11] trying to find someplace that's got a
[34:12] big enough dining hall and a better a
[34:14] good enough brunch and can give a group
[34:15] discount and not add the gratuity on at
[34:17] 18 since we're over a party of eight and
[34:19] we'd be do there's a lot of other things
[34:20] we could be doing in a lot cooler places
[34:25] I would even venture to say that if it
[34:27] wasn't for the second birth
[34:29] we'd be living wherever we wanted to
[34:31] live doing whatever we wanted to do and
[34:33] it probably wouldn't be Phoenix
[34:36] there's something about that second
[34:37] birth that changes everything
[34:41] Jesus is saying by your first birth
[34:44] as he talks about that which is of the
[34:46] flesh his flesh is flesh it's by our
[34:49] first birth that we understand and live
[34:50] within the natural world
[34:52] I mean that sounds so duh right the only
[34:55] reason why you can live as you were born
[34:58] the only way you understand the natural
[35:00] word is because you were born into it
[35:01] that's the birth of the natural man
[35:04] and he's wanting to bring us parallel to
[35:06] be born of of Heaven brings forth New
[35:08] Life to where you can begin to live and
[35:11] understand the kingdom of God we've been
[35:13] born into the kingdom of this world and
[35:15] the in the different kingdoms of animal
[35:18] life and plant life and all the
[35:19] different Arrangements of life and
[35:21] that's what we're born in we're born
[35:22] into this world but now he's saying you
[35:24] can be born again and be born from above
[35:27] you can begin to live in God's kingdom
[35:29] and see or understand God's Kingdom
[35:32] he continues to amplify what it means to
[35:34] be born again if you continue to read in
[35:35] John chapter 3 or just making quick
[35:37] reference that whosoever believeth in
[35:39] him should not perish but have eternal
[35:41] life that's whosoever believeth shall be
[35:43] born again have eternal life
[35:46] we've touched on this I think it's a
[35:48] whole separate subject and I need to
[35:49] hurry up so I'm just going to reference
[35:50] it very quickly to be part of the tree
[35:52] of life you have to be born again
[35:55] we know that in the book there's two
[35:57] records there's one book two records a
[35:58] book of life which records all the wheat
[36:00] plant but then the record of eternal
[36:02] life or the Lamb's Book of Life and
[36:05] that's the germ the seed
[36:07] and so there can even even look at it
[36:09] how there's a record of all all Humanity
[36:11] that grows up that eventually just
[36:13] become dead dry stock
[36:15] and those names can be removed right but
[36:19] then there's a record of how the life
[36:21] even in your life you were just a wheat
[36:22] plant but by virtue of predestination
[36:25] you were a gene seed of God and so your
[36:28] name is written in the Lamb's Book of
[36:30] Life and can never be removed and so
[36:32] there's even an image of a family tree
[36:34] in the image of the books
[36:37] and those that are recorded in the
[36:38] Lamb's Book of Life and then those are
[36:40] recorded in the record of life and if
[36:41] your name is removed from the record of
[36:43] life when you stand before white Throne
[36:44] you have no inheritance in the Eternal
[36:46] but those whose names is in the lamb
[36:48] book Lamb's Book life are doing the
[36:50] judging of the wheat plant
[36:56] you know
[37:00] in First Corinthians chapter 12 verses
[37:02] 12 to 14
[37:04] Paul is saying how the body of Christ
[37:06] has many members but one body just as a
[37:08] tree has many branches but it's one tree
[37:11] it says for by one Spirit verse 13 for
[37:13] by one Spirit we are all baptized into
[37:15] one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[37:17] whether we be Bond or free and have been
[37:19] made all to drink into one Spirit no
[37:21] matter what branch you are on the tree
[37:23] you have the same root system that's
[37:24] drawn from the same Life Source just as
[37:26] the lamps depicted in the church ages
[37:28] draw from the same Source not only are
[37:30] the age of Messengers representing the
[37:32] lamb but every believer is represented a
[37:34] lamp of drawing from the same Life
[37:35] Source you are part of this body
[37:38] different members but one body neither
[37:41] Jew nor Gentile of this Branch or that
[37:43] lineage or that DNA but you're all
[37:45] baptized by one Spirit what are you born
[37:47] into the family of God by the new birth
[37:50] brother Branham says in the chapter 4
[37:52] the church age book now to receive
[37:53] Christ is to receive his spirit
[37:55] to receive his spirit is to be born
[37:59] again
[38:01] to receive a spirit is to be baptized
[38:03] with the Holy Ghost can you do the math
[38:04] a equals b equals C C equals a a equals
[38:07] B they're all the same thing to be born
[38:09] against to receive a spirit to be born
[38:10] again is to be baptized with the Holy
[38:12] Ghost
[38:12] they are one in the same
[38:14] could read in other places where he says
[38:16] this
[38:17] so now
[38:20] everybody all right everybody good you
[38:22] good you're my litmus test today when
[38:24] you start fading then that's when I'm
[38:25] gonna start wrapping up not trying to
[38:27] encourage you to be a drama
[38:30] uh major or anything right now but
[38:32] everyone hope everyone's staying with me
[38:34] it's a little hotter up here because
[38:36] we're on the south campus side where
[38:38] there's no AC working
[38:41] now in Acts chapter 2 verses 36 to 41
[38:44] this is this is where I hope that what's
[38:46] happening is it's becoming more Vivid
[38:49] the language of the scripture the birth
[38:51] of the church what Jesus said to
[38:53] Nicodemus the sermon that Peter preaches
[38:55] on the day of Pentecost therefore let
[38:57] all the house of Israel know assuredly
[38:59] the lineage the genealogy the house the
[39:02] fam of Israel Noah surely that God hath
[39:04] made that same Jesus whom ye have
[39:06] crucified both Lord and Christ now when
[39:08] they heard this they were pricked in the
[39:10] heart and sending to Peter into the rest
[39:11] of the Apostles men and Brethren what
[39:13] shall we do
[39:16] this is a response from those of the
[39:17] house in the lineage of David the house
[39:19] of Israel
[39:20] he says and then Peter said unto them
[39:23] repent and be baptized every one of you
[39:26] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[39:28] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[39:30] the gift of the Holy Ghost so to receive
[39:33] his Spirit as a gift to receive his
[39:35] spirit is to be born again to receive
[39:37] his spirit is to be baptized with the
[39:38] Holy Ghost so you repent you believe you
[39:41] repent you to be baptized in the name of
[39:43] Jesus Christ because your sins have been
[39:45] remitted and then you are Born Again by
[39:48] The Gift of the Holy Ghost
[39:50] this is the prescription
[39:52] this is the answer oh we're on the house
[39:55] of Israel we have get crucified an
[39:57] innocent man what should we do well you
[40:00] remember when John was saying the ax is
[40:02] laid to the root of the tree and you
[40:03] needed to repent and he was baptizing by
[40:06] immersion symbolizing that which was to
[40:09] come and looking forward to this now I'm
[40:11] telling you that what Jesus taught in
[40:13] John 3 what John was symbolizing on the
[40:16] Jordan River this is what you must now
[40:18] do you must repent and be baptized in
[40:21] the name of Jesus Christ and you need to
[40:24] be born again
[40:27] and then that's why even the language he
[40:30] uses next for the promises unto you you
[40:32] need to be born again and your children
[40:35] need to be born again
[40:37] because just because you get born again
[40:38] they're not any more converted this is
[40:41] something revolutionary you reckon your
[40:43] genealogy back to Abraham you were of
[40:45] the House of Israel but I'm telling you
[40:47] that you need to be born again and once
[40:49] you've converted and what you've been
[40:51] changed and once you've done it even
[40:52] your children need to do it because now
[40:55] we're using a complete different record
[40:57] than the one you're used to
[40:59] and
[41:01] to all that are far off
[41:03] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[41:06] call
[41:07] gives new meaning to these names that
[41:09] are added and these names that are being
[41:11] called and with many other words did he
[41:12] testify and exhort saying save
[41:15] yourselves from this untoward generation
[41:20] and verse 41 then they that gladly
[41:22] received his word
[41:24] this is how it works they that gladly
[41:26] received his word were baptized
[41:29] sometimes you wonder when people receive
[41:30] the word and they're not baptized maybe
[41:32] they weren't gladly receiving it
[41:34] and the same day there were added unto
[41:37] them about 3 000 Souls
[41:42] you're not talking about shoes
[41:45] the same day were added unto them about
[41:47] 3 000 Souls not added to a natural
[41:50] Church
[41:51] not reckoned to a different genealogy or
[41:53] natural record not added to the house of
[41:55] Israel
[41:57] the house of Israel no
[41:59] what must we do you need to be changed
[42:01] you need to be born again you don't need
[42:03] to have proselytes to your to the house
[42:05] of Israel you need to be changed
[42:07] completely
[42:08] in verse 47 it says praising God and
[42:11] having favor with all the people and the
[42:13] Lord added to the church daily such as
[42:16] should be saved now I'm transitioning a
[42:19] little bit I know it's getting hot it's
[42:20] getting lengthy here I want you to just
[42:22] we're we're waiting for the water to
[42:24] warm up for those who are being baptized
[42:27] they this is very important for us to
[42:29] catch now because I'm transitioning to a
[42:31] birthplace our family tree what did it
[42:33] speak of even this church
[42:35] this church serves the true church so
[42:37] remember those images we've tried to
[42:38] bring to you praising God and having
[42:40] favor with all the people and the Lord
[42:42] added to the church daily such as should
[42:44] be saved those that were saved or added
[42:46] to the church but which church was
[42:47] growing
[42:49] ask yourself which church was growing it
[42:52] wasn't just the local Gathering because
[42:55] as we looked at how they all gathered
[42:56] from all these different places from
[42:58] Egypt and philistia and phenicia and
[43:00] Ethiopia and all these different places
[43:01] they'd gathered for the Passover and
[43:03] they were there they were there for the
[43:05] Feast of Pentecost they were there
[43:06] during that time and then what was going
[43:08] to they were going to hear the word they
[43:09] were going to be saved and it didn't
[43:10] mean they had to stay there they were
[43:12] going back to where they came from
[43:15] and so it wasn't just the church that
[43:17] was growing locally but it was the true
[43:19] church
[43:20] the souls were being added to the true
[43:22] church how because they were repenting
[43:24] being baptized and being born again by
[43:26] one Spirit they were being baptized into
[43:28] the body of Christ and they had become a
[43:31] member of the family
[43:35] I'm sure that you know this
[43:37] well to be a part of the local church no
[43:39] birth is required
[43:42] to be added to the uh the membership
[43:45] directory if you didn't get the email
[43:47] that's what we're alluding to you might
[43:48] need to be added to the directory
[43:50] and and all you have to do is you just
[43:53] to be a member of a church even
[43:54] according to the message to be a voting
[43:55] member you support it with ties and your
[43:58] attendance
[43:59] and anybody who has money to give and a
[44:03] body to bring to church can become a
[44:04] member of a church
[44:07] and and but the true church is the
[44:09] pedigree of Christ
[44:11] it requires a New Birth by God's spirit
[44:14] where you become members but there's no
[44:17] membership
[44:19] because there's when I look at my hand I
[44:22] mean if my thumb could talk it's not
[44:25] going to ask the pinky where's your
[44:26] membership card right
[44:27] it's a member
[44:29] but there's no membership because it's
[44:32] still one body
[44:34] and so a local church can offer
[44:36] membership to anyone
[44:39] and provide an opportunity for
[44:41] membership but remember the goal of the
[44:43] local church is not membership
[44:45] the goal of the local church is to be a
[44:47] birthplace for the seed of God
[44:50] Esther the local church is interested in
[44:53] births brother Madam in the message the
[44:55] way of a true Prophet I've chose these
[44:56] two just to kind of get our minds uh you
[44:59] know kind of looking around in virtual
[45:01] reality inside our heads trying to
[45:02] figure out how this all fits there's
[45:04] nobody can join the church you join a
[45:06] lodge
[45:07] you don't join a church the capital c is
[45:09] used here you're born in a church and
[45:12] he's going to clarify the church you're
[45:14] born in a church you joined the
[45:15] Methodist Lodge the Baptist Lodge the
[45:17] Catholic Lodge the Pentecostal Lodge
[45:19] what would we call ours
[45:22] but you're born into the Church of the
[45:26] Living God
[45:27] and that's what he's coming after the
[45:30] church
[45:31] so we have lodges not churches
[45:35] anything can gather in that Lodge
[45:37] Hypocrites and everything else I know
[45:39] this I know this is tricky the
[45:41] vernacular he's using but Ponder this
[45:43] anything can gather in that Lodge
[45:45] Hypocrites and everything else but I'll
[45:47] let you know this right now according to
[45:49] the word there's not one hypocrite in
[45:50] the Church of the Living God there's
[45:52] nothing there but Saints
[45:55] you think there's three kinds of
[45:56] Believers in the true church
[45:58] no in the true church there's only one
[46:01] one believer Saints
[46:04] there's not even three kinds of
[46:06] Believers you're a Believer you're an
[46:08] Uber believer and you're the uberous
[46:09] believer no you're all believers
[46:12] not one hypocrite in the Church of the
[46:14] Living God then in the message is your
[46:16] life worthy of the Gospel there's no
[46:18] such a thing as Pentecostal Church
[46:23] there's no such thing as Baptist Church
[46:25] it's Baptist Lodge Pentecostal Lodge
[46:28] Presbyterian Lodge but there's only one
[46:31] Church
[46:32] and there's only one way you can get
[46:33] into it and that's by birth
[46:36] you realize what we ought to be
[46:37] interested in as a church as Leaders of
[46:40] our families as members of this church
[46:42] what we ought to be interested in is not
[46:45] growing membership but making sure that
[46:47] this is what people are coming to is
[46:50] this church
[46:52] listen Phoenix didn't need another Lodge
[46:55] all right we didn't come here to be in
[46:56] the hospitality industry in the line of
[46:58] Hiltons and Marriotts no the goal is to
[47:02] see the seed of God find their place
[47:06] there's only one thing you can get only
[47:08] one way you can get into it and that's
[47:09] by birth you're born into the Church of
[47:11] Jesus Christ and a member of his body
[47:13] the spiritual delegation of heaven then
[47:16] the signs that Christ is with you lives
[47:18] through you Christians oh you must have
[47:20] a personal relationship to God in order
[47:22] to be a Son of God you must become
[47:24] relation to God he must be your father
[47:27] in order for you to be a son and only
[47:29] his sons and daughters are saved
[47:33] only those who listen this is very very
[47:35] important to understand only those who
[47:38] have the baptismal Holy Ghost truly
[47:39] possess eternal life the Holy Ghost is
[47:42] eternal life only those who've truly
[47:43] been born again by being baptized with
[47:45] the Holy Ghost are Sons and Daughters of
[47:47] God otherwise you have sons and
[47:48] daughters of God being left in
[47:50] Tribulation and standing before white
[47:51] Throne judgment but only his sons and
[47:53] daughters are saved not the members of a
[47:55] church but Sons and Daughters there's
[47:57] only one thing that'll produce that
[47:59] that's the new birth
[48:01] that the new birth is the only thing
[48:04] that will produce relationship to God
[48:08] Preston being baptized today doesn't
[48:10] make you a member of this church you're
[48:11] that already
[48:14] but to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[48:16] Christ you're seeking a birth a new
[48:19] birth
[48:20] Jesus answered and Senator Nicodemus
[48:22] verily verily I send to thee except a
[48:25] man be born again the way Jesus puts it
[48:27] and the next moment is you must be born
[48:30] again or you'll never be able to
[48:31] understand the kingdom of God
[48:33] think about that
[48:34] unless you're born again you'll never be
[48:37] able to understand the kingdom of God
[48:39] you can you can observe all sorts of
[48:41] things as it relates to the move of God
[48:43] and the manifestation of the spirit
[48:44] within churches but you'll never
[48:46] understand the kingdom of God
[48:49] brother banham said in a message Paradox
[48:51] for instance I believe that every
[48:52] born-again member of the body of Christ
[48:54] is a paradox in themselves
[48:56] I believe each of you methodists and
[48:58] Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had
[49:00] experience the baptism of the Holy
[49:01] Spirit was in some formal church that
[49:04] did not believe in the genuine New Birth
[49:06] and has now received the baptism of the
[49:08] Holy Ghost genuine New Birth is tied to
[49:09] the baptismal ghost is a perfect example
[49:11] of a paradox because something happened
[49:14] to you that changed your whole being
[49:17] and anyone could look at that and know
[49:19] what a paradox is a miracle
[49:22] right now notice this next statement
[49:24] glad it's on its own slide unless that
[49:26] happens you're there you cannot be a
[49:30] Christian
[49:34] that's not that we'd be waving at and
[49:35] anybody anybody's face who professes to
[49:37] be a Christian
[49:38] but this is our understanding
[49:41] maybe you could bring it up to somebody
[49:42] who says they're a Christian say oh
[49:44] you've been born again
[49:46] Because unless that happens a genuine
[49:49] New Birth which is to receive the
[49:51] baptismally ghost unless that happens
[49:53] you cannot be a Christian
[49:55] then in order to be a Christian Church
[49:58] it has to be a gathering of Christians
[50:00] and it has to be producing Christians
[50:04] it's not about running out and finding
[50:06] somebody who is Islam or somebody who's
[50:09] in some other religion and just getting
[50:11] them to profess Christ and be born again
[50:13] by a new profession and joining a church
[50:15] now they've just changed membership
[50:17] we make them proselytes
[50:20] and they're a twofold child of hell
[50:21] because now they've just changed
[50:23] membership from one ideology to another
[50:24] ideology and they've never been changed
[50:26] but now they have the reinforcement of
[50:29] all this perceived Vindication and all
[50:31] the righteousness that surrounds them
[50:33] and they feel safe and knowing I believe
[50:34] God sent a prophet brother God thought
[50:36] it brother man has spoken I believe it
[50:38] that settles it and that makes me that's
[50:40] the proof that I have the Holy Ghost no
[50:42] no no no wait a minute there is a
[50:44] definite experience of the Holy Ghost
[50:46] that every single message believer must
[50:50] have it doesn't matter how well you know
[50:52] it it doesn't mean if your pedigree goes
[50:54] all the way back to day one of the
[50:55] Branham Tabernacle ye must be born again
[51:01] good he says in the breach between the
[51:04] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals
[51:05] Center friend or lukewarm church member
[51:07] do you just have a membership in a
[51:09] church or do you have a membership not
[51:11] have a membership
[51:13] I remember he's saying that he he didn't
[51:15] he said these same things and at the
[51:16] Branham Tabernacle he scolded them at
[51:18] Branham Tabernacle
[51:20] and if you have only a membership you'd
[51:22] be pretty near as well off without it
[51:25] you need a birth
[51:27] and the breach brother Branham we're
[51:29] about now this is the breach between the
[51:30] seven churches and the Seven Seals
[51:32] shouldn't we be talking about something
[51:33] a little bit more heady at this point
[51:35] you need a birth you must come to the
[51:36] blood you must come to something that
[51:39] just spots the sin away to there's no
[51:41] more remembrance of it if you haven't
[51:43] made preparation yet to meet the lamb in
[51:45] the air and by the power this is so
[51:47] beautiful and by the power invested
[51:49] invested me by my commission given by
[51:52] almighty God and minister to me by an
[51:54] Angel a pillar of light
[51:58] I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:00] don't try to meet him with only a
[52:02] membership of a lodge a church of this
[52:05] Earth
[52:07] listen the only thing that makes the
[52:09] difference from a lodge and a real
[52:11] church is the fact that there's born
[52:13] ones in there
[52:15] that there's those that have been born
[52:16] again that's what makes it different
[52:17] than just any other gathering without
[52:19] Christians it is just a lodge
[52:22] without being a birthplace without those
[52:24] who've been born by the spirit of God it
[52:26] becomes just a lodge
[52:30] don't try to make them think about this
[52:32] this is March 17th in the evening 1963
[52:36] he knows he's going to be preaching the
[52:38] first seal on the end of the urgency
[52:41] hears he says now as we still have time
[52:43] before the lamb takes the book as he
[52:44] uses that language he's saying
[52:47] by the power
[52:49] invested me by my commission given by
[52:52] almighty God and ministered to be by an
[52:54] Angel a pillar of light whoo
[52:56] I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:58] at the doorstep of the seals
[53:01] don't try to meet him with only a
[53:03] membership of a lodge the Church of this
[53:05] Earth
[53:06] make preparation by being born again
[53:09] question and answers on Hebrews part
[53:10] three he says
[53:12] 1957 so therefore friends membership of
[53:14] a church
[53:17] or knowledge of some theology or
[53:19] something
[53:20] that could be message theology
[53:22] I know we hear a lot of preachers
[53:24] talking about message theologians can't
[53:26] wait till they come out with the
[53:27] directory of who these message
[53:28] theologians are because
[53:30] it always seems like they're kind of
[53:31] hinting at some people we should be
[53:32] watching
[53:35] but there's membership of a church or
[53:36] knowledge of some theology or something
[53:38] don't have one thing to do with it
[53:41] it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:42] in a new birth that joins you to him as
[53:44] one person
[53:45] it's what it's got to be
[53:47] not membership at a church
[53:49] you can change church is all you want
[53:50] won't change you a bit
[53:53] unless she finally changed the one
[53:54] that's interested in changing you
[53:57] it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:58] and a new birth that joins you to him as
[54:00] one person
[54:02] Jeremiah chapter 17 verses 5 to 8.
[54:06] I know we're just about into the after
[54:07] hour just stay with me
[54:09] Jeremiah chapter 17 verses 5 to 8 thus
[54:11] saith the Lord
[54:13] curse be the man that trusteth in man
[54:16] and maketh this maketh flesh his arm
[54:18] flesh is protector flesh is supporter
[54:21] his Defender his provider and whose
[54:23] heart departeth from the Lord and I want
[54:25] you to catch this image now kind of
[54:27] maybe seeding some things for the future
[54:28] now for he be like the heath in the
[54:31] desert you know some say that it'd be
[54:33] like a Tamarisk in the desert it's
[54:35] individual the heath in the desert
[54:38] naked stripped it's a naked stripped
[54:41] destitute tree that's what this Heath in
[54:43] the desert is
[54:44] I hope nobody's naming their son Heath
[54:48] yeah no I have no problem with Heath I
[54:50] just came in my mind be like the heath
[54:51] and the desert
[54:53] stripped and destitute tree and shall
[54:56] not see when good cometh it can't
[54:58] partake of good
[55:00] it's a tree in the desert
[55:02] and even if it rains they can't receive
[55:05] it
[55:06] even if even when the word is preached
[55:09] it's as if it's far from them because
[55:10] they're just strip destitute in the
[55:12] desert they can't get any benefits they
[55:15] can't partake in good but shall inhabit
[55:18] the parched places in the wilderness dry
[55:20] parched
[55:22] in a salt land and not inhabited
[55:26] now I'm gonna have to condense this very
[55:28] quickly but this is applicable to
[55:30] churches
[55:31] this describes churches because talks in
[55:34] several places they become dry and
[55:35] carnal
[55:37] I trust you just I hope you're all
[55:39] messes theologians this morning so you
[55:40] know what I'm referring to when I talk
[55:41] about the church being dry brother Brown
[55:43] described the stock the wheat plant as
[55:45] being what dried up
[55:47] the churches seven Church ages all these
[55:49] churches dried up no life in them
[55:51] there's no cannot bring forth Sons and
[55:53] Daughters of God they're sterile they're
[55:54] dry they're all dried up they become dry
[55:56] car this is applicable to churches but
[55:58] then it's also applicable to members
[55:59] brother Brown talks about them in dry
[56:01] sticky they fuss and stew
[56:04] even in the church age book he uses this
[56:06] scripture Luke chapter 23 verse 31 for
[56:09] if they do these things in a green tree
[56:11] which shall be done in the dry
[56:13] the Jews compared a good man to a green
[56:15] tree and he's saying if they will kill
[56:17] an innocent man what the way they do to
[56:19] a bad man so they had a the Jews had a
[56:22] tradition that a good man is a green
[56:23] tree a bad man is a dead one and brother
[56:25] around him in the church age book uses
[56:27] this very script should refer to
[56:28] churches
[56:29] there can be green trees there can be
[56:32] dry trees
[56:33] there can be trees that are living there
[56:35] could be trees that are dead
[56:37] and so there's a cursed man who trusts
[56:39] in himself and he makes the flesh his
[56:42] protector his arm his Defender but now
[56:45] verse 7 blessed is the man that trusteth
[56:47] in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is
[56:49] for he shall be as a tree planted By the
[56:52] Waters and that spreadeth out her Roots
[56:55] by the river and shall not see when heat
[56:59] cometh just as the other one cannot see
[57:01] when good cometh in other words it can't
[57:04] get rain it can't benefit from rain it
[57:05] it's all dried up it's not receiving
[57:07] rain but now it's saying it's not gonna
[57:10] have to worry about when heat cometh
[57:11] because her Leaf shall be green blessed
[57:14] is the man who trusteth in the Lord he
[57:17] shall be as a tree that spreadeth out
[57:20] her Roots by the river shall not see
[57:22] when he cometh and her leaves shall be
[57:25] green do you see the image of a church
[57:26] and shall not be careful in the year of
[57:28] drought neither shall cease from
[57:30] yielding fruit
[57:32] isn't that a beautiful description
[57:35] now I have to come to this this is my my
[57:38] closing emphasis and I've actually
[57:40] written some of these things down just
[57:42] so I can be very deliberate in what I'm
[57:43] saying in Jeremiah chapter 17 as you
[57:46] have a cursed tree and then you have a
[57:48] blessed a cursed man and a blessed man
[57:51] cursed Tree on a blessed tree
[57:54] if the dry staleness starchy but then
[57:58] you have this other one that it's
[57:59] planted by Waters it spread out her
[58:01] roots
[58:02] heat's not going to destroy her Leaf is
[58:05] always Green in the year of drought
[58:06] she's not worried her fruit's never
[58:08] going to cease
[58:11] connecting this back to what Jesus said
[58:13] about a proselyte if you're only a
[58:15] church member I want you to think about
[58:16] if you only are a church member
[58:19] you can become a proselyte of any church
[58:22] right that's all you are is a church
[58:24] member then you can come over
[58:27] right to another church and be a prosely
[58:31] if you are just a church member you can
[58:34] proselytize someone to become a member
[58:37] right because if you're just a church
[58:39] member you're just like Nicodemus you
[58:41] think that a gentile's the only one that
[58:43] can come over and be born Anew and that
[58:46] happens by subscribing to a new ideology
[58:48] a new way of saying things come over
[58:50] trust in this arm why don't you come if
[58:52] you are only a church member all you
[58:54] really do is proselytize someone else to
[58:56] become a member
[58:58] and let me say this
[59:00] if all we have are church members
[59:03] then we'll be afraid
[59:05] that someone else could proselytize them
[59:07] right that's all we have that all we
[59:10] have is church members then we should
[59:11] we're always afraid that someone will
[59:13] proselytize the members of the church
[59:16] but I'm saying this to to this not to
[59:19] defend not even as commentary on
[59:22] churches
[59:24] but
[59:25] a church is interested in a birth
[59:29] so in a church a church a church and a
[59:32] church that's interested in birth makes
[59:34] no claims on Sons and Daughters of God
[59:37] if that's what a church is interested in
[59:39] then their their goal is to see that
[59:41] Sons and Daughters of God are baptized
[59:43] by one Spirit into the family of God and
[59:46] that they know that the sons of God are
[59:47] led by the spirit of God and they don't
[59:50] claim any ownership over the children of
[59:52] God
[59:53] if we have members we could say we own
[59:56] you all day long your name on the
[59:57] directory well if you don't do this
[59:58] we'll just take your name right out of
[59:59] the directory that's one reason why I
[1:00:00] don't like directories is they're adding
[1:00:02] and removing it's kind of like well let
[1:00:03] me just print out a phone book
[1:00:05] believing they'll all be in there
[1:00:06] eventually right
[1:00:10] there's every just print out zip codes
[1:00:12] and area code directories and claim them
[1:00:16] for the glory of God no we won't do that
[1:00:18] don't have enough toner
[1:00:22] but if you're a member
[1:00:24] ow so a church is interested in birth
[1:00:27] and then the church then is not making
[1:00:29] claims on
[1:00:30] on they don't make claims on the sons or
[1:00:32] don't have a god
[1:00:33] and listen if you're a son or daughter
[1:00:35] of God if you're a member of the body of
[1:00:37] Christ you're not the property of any
[1:00:39] church
[1:00:42] you are a fruitful tree
[1:00:45] planted by the rivers of water
[1:00:47] that attracts those that are in parched
[1:00:51] places
[1:00:52] so that's a mouthful well I got it from
[1:00:54] the message let me read it to you how I
[1:00:56] let me read to you in a few quotes here
[1:00:58] as we continue on where this struck out
[1:01:00] struck out to me brother Bram says in
[1:01:02] the evening messenger that's the mat
[1:01:03] what's the matter today is membership
[1:01:05] yes members Big membership big Sunday
[1:01:07] School classes pay prizes for somebody
[1:01:09] that can press the light and bring
[1:01:10] somebody else from some other church
[1:01:12] over
[1:01:14] big prizes
[1:01:16] bring a friend they might get an iPad
[1:01:18] next Sunday
[1:01:20] pay prizes for somebody that can process
[1:01:22] like and bring somebody else from some
[1:01:23] of the church over see who had the most
[1:01:25] you know that's phariseeism
[1:01:29] and then make a big brag about it we
[1:01:31] beat them last Sunday
[1:01:33] if you've got to a place could you
[1:01:35] imagine if we we kind of always messaged
[1:01:37] churches we had to kind of submit our
[1:01:38] roles
[1:01:39] right how many did you have in church
[1:01:41] Sunday morning brother well we only had
[1:01:42] you know so many like huh
[1:01:45] you're falling way far in these fantasy
[1:01:47] church rankings buddy you should
[1:01:49] probably propose a couple trains there
[1:01:51] pal you're not gonna win the League this
[1:01:54] year
[1:01:55] he says if you've got to a place where
[1:01:58] you have to make the Church of God a rat
[1:02:00] race then it's time to close the doors
[1:02:02] and go home
[1:02:04] there's a reason to count the Sheep when
[1:02:07] it comes to a trustee when it comes a
[1:02:09] deacon there's a reason why you want to
[1:02:10] know how many parking spaces do we have
[1:02:12] how many chairs do we need to put out
[1:02:13] it's good to know who's coming into the
[1:02:15] Sunday school class who's coming into
[1:02:16] into the uh into the youth group and
[1:02:19] those things there's a reason to count
[1:02:20] there's a reason to begin to identify
[1:02:22] and number certain things there's a
[1:02:23] right way to do it but if that's the
[1:02:25] goal is to see that the we're inching up
[1:02:27] in membership time to close the doors
[1:02:29] and go home
[1:02:31] Church of God listen the Church of God
[1:02:34] is a living article of God on Earth
[1:02:36] manifest in Jesus Christ that's what the
[1:02:39] Church of God is and so therefore a
[1:02:41] church ought to be a gathering of living
[1:02:42] articles
[1:02:44] I've got a living articles to attract
[1:02:46] those you're a living article therefore
[1:02:48] here you are you're at a green tree
[1:02:50] you're a fruitful tree you're drawing
[1:02:52] from a well Source people should see
[1:02:54] your branches they should see your fruit
[1:02:57] and say where did you get green like
[1:02:59] that where did you get fruit like that
[1:03:01] where do you get joy like that well how
[1:03:03] can you live like that I'm planted by a
[1:03:06] river of water
[1:03:07] I've dug down deep and I found a source
[1:03:10] that makes me the way that I am and all
[1:03:12] those dead dry parched trees say lead me
[1:03:15] to that Oasis lead me to that Branch I
[1:03:18] want to find a place in it
[1:03:21] listen the idea of the Grove when
[1:03:22] Abraham planted it was to satisfy those
[1:03:25] who are traveling in dry places
[1:03:28] those that were parched and dry and
[1:03:30] weary and traveling coming through the
[1:03:32] desert heat they'd find a place out on
[1:03:34] the horizon they'd see not a mirage but
[1:03:37] an actual Oasis in Abraham waiting and
[1:03:39] you see somebody coming he said oh Sarah
[1:03:42] here's our chance
[1:03:44] to declare the name of God
[1:03:47] and it's not as they pass by Jesus
[1:03:51] right that's what people I used to have
[1:03:52] some
[1:03:53] acquaintances
[1:03:55] back in the day and I was preaching to
[1:03:57] the church and these guys were driving
[1:03:58] me I can't remember what point in the
[1:04:00] whole weekend it was but they did drive
[1:04:01] by praisings
[1:04:04] I guess they used to be gangsters and
[1:04:07] they would drive by and they'd say
[1:04:08] hallelujah and they scare people and
[1:04:10] yell out drive by praisings and that's
[1:04:12] not what Abraham was doing
[1:04:16] Abraham wasn't Karma hey God spoke to me
[1:04:19] I'm the real deal my seed are going to
[1:04:21] be like the Sands of the earth and the
[1:04:22] stars of Heaven he would invite them in
[1:04:24] wash their feet minister to them nourish
[1:04:26] them and begin to declare the name of
[1:04:28] God and then when they would ask and in
[1:04:30] quash say thank you Abraham he said oh
[1:04:33] no no no no I didn't do this Elohim
[1:04:36] Jehovah who's this Jehovah you speak of
[1:04:38] he's the one true God how can I serve
[1:04:40] him would you like to make a sacrifice
[1:04:42] to him here
[1:04:44] that's what the Grove represented
[1:04:47] listen we don't want we don't want uh
[1:04:49] we don't want members we want born ones
[1:04:54] LED ones
[1:04:55] those that are LED
[1:04:58] what I desire is that there be born ones
[1:05:01] I would desire that born ones gather and
[1:05:04] those unborn when they gather be born
[1:05:09] who find that their worth is not wrapped
[1:05:11] up in a church image
[1:05:15] that it's not who they are as Jeremiah
[1:05:18] said
[1:05:18] that trust in man and makes man makes
[1:05:21] flesh his arm
[1:05:24] his protector his Defender
[1:05:27] our worth is not tied up in our church
[1:05:28] image
[1:05:30] that we have to improve upon the church
[1:05:32] image in order to improve on who we are
[1:05:34] you are who you are by the grace of God
[1:05:36] and by election and no Lodge will ever
[1:05:40] change that
[1:05:43] brother Brandon I just I want you to
[1:05:44] catch this image when I say you are you
[1:05:46] are a tree
[1:05:48] I said that's an attraction and God
[1:05:50] identified himself by his
[1:05:51] characteristics all our things in
[1:05:53] Arizona are trees
[1:05:55] are full of stickers
[1:05:57] everything has a sticker
[1:06:00] it's because it's dry
[1:06:02] now that same Bush growed over here
[1:06:05] it'd be a nice lovely leaf
[1:06:07] see it's without water and that's the
[1:06:10] reason it becomes a sticker
[1:06:12] remember Jeremiah says in Jeremiah 17
[1:06:14] the heath in the desert sorry Heath that
[1:06:17] when they can't see in good cometh they
[1:06:20] inhabit Parts dried places the salt land
[1:06:22] not inhabited it's just a miserable
[1:06:24] existence brother batam is saying it's
[1:06:26] without water that's the reason it
[1:06:27] becomes a sticker and when the church
[1:06:29] becomes without the Water of Life
[1:06:31] it gets dry and sticky too sticking and
[1:06:35] punching and everything
[1:06:37] right when the water of life is not
[1:06:40] flowing that's when we just start
[1:06:41] punching at other people
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:45] Heath just over there sucker punching
[1:06:47] every message Theologian why because
[1:06:50] there's no River of Life flowing
[1:06:54] and he says it opens When the Water of
[1:06:56] Life flows it opens up the leaf and
[1:06:58] makes it tender mellow it's sweet holy
[1:07:02] and acceptable unto God listen listen to
[1:07:05] this so may the Lord God water us
[1:07:07] tonight that we won't be stickers
[1:07:11] listen I'm not talking about Arizona
[1:07:13] Believers Church I'm talking about the
[1:07:15] Believers
[1:07:17] the only way this church can ever keep
[1:07:19] from getting sticky the only way this
[1:07:21] church can ever keep from being a
[1:07:22] heathen just punches is when you when
[1:07:25] you become a fruitful bowel when you
[1:07:27] become one that won't be a sticker but
[1:07:30] will be fine leaves
[1:07:33] oh the only way this tree can be
[1:07:36] inviting is when you become fine leaves
[1:07:39] that the Wayward people might sit down
[1:07:42] under the tree of our shade
[1:07:44] and find rest to their souls
[1:07:48] people might sit under this the tree of
[1:07:51] our shade
[1:07:53] this tree
[1:07:54] our leaves
[1:07:56] Ah that's what it is
[1:07:59] our leaves
[1:08:00] you you say oh it's hot in here why
[1:08:02] don't you shade somebody
[1:08:04] hey seriously
[1:08:06] I'm not literally don't hover over
[1:08:08] brother loyal right now but
[1:08:10] you're the leaves your life your nature
[1:08:13] your character listen we know it there's
[1:08:16] there's different ways brother man talks
[1:08:18] about people in a church cast a shadow
[1:08:21] of over other people they cast a shadow
[1:08:23] over the service they come resenting and
[1:08:26] the Holy Spirit won't reveal they come
[1:08:28] with unconfessed sin and that causes the
[1:08:30] church to bitterly fail what's happening
[1:08:31] it's a dried up sticky uh leaf that
[1:08:34] doesn't want to change and it casts to
[1:08:36] Paul over the church and so what we need
[1:08:38] to be is be sure that we're a green leaf
[1:08:41] now our roots are down deep so that we
[1:08:44] can find that one that's sticky and
[1:08:47] cover them
[1:08:48] come over them and let them see that
[1:08:51] there is a genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:08:53] Ghost there is a River of Life what he
[1:08:56] says it shall flow out of you rivers of
[1:08:57] Living Water shall flow out of you
[1:09:01] oh may God water us that we won't be
[1:09:03] stickers but we'll be fine leaves
[1:09:06] the Wayward people would sit under the
[1:09:08] shade of our tree
[1:09:10] and find rest to their souls
[1:09:14] oh God
[1:09:16] has anybody noticed something about this
[1:09:18] service yet
[1:09:22] I haven't got to my text
[1:09:26] so here we go let's close on this Psalms
[1:09:28] 87.
[1:09:32] the psalmer song for the sons of Korah
[1:09:34] some people don't like it
[1:09:37] but it's in the Bible
[1:09:40] his foundation is in the Holy mountains
[1:09:43] the Lord
[1:09:45] let me read let me read you some other
[1:09:48] translations of this he founded Zion on
[1:09:50] the Holy Mountain and oh God and oh how
[1:09:53] God loves his home
[1:09:58] his foundation is in the Holy mountains
[1:09:59] the Lord loveth the gates of Zion the
[1:10:02] city of his foundation is on the Holy
[1:10:03] Mountain the lord loves the gates of
[1:10:05] Zion how he loves his home he loves the
[1:10:08] city of Jerusalem it was founded by the
[1:10:10] Lord talking about a city
[1:10:12] the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more
[1:10:14] than all the dwellings of Jacob
[1:10:18] why because there's one spiritual
[1:10:20] all these natural right
[1:10:23] glorious things are spoken of Thee
[1:10:27] spoken of you o city of God
[1:10:30] 's Hometown everyone there is talking
[1:10:33] about you
[1:10:35] oh city of God what glorious things are
[1:10:38] said of you
[1:10:41] listen they're Gathering and they're not
[1:10:43] talking about all their natural
[1:10:44] dwellings they're not talking about all
[1:10:46] the dwellings of Jacob they're not
[1:10:48] talking about all the dwellings of
[1:10:49] Israel they're talking about what God
[1:10:51] has done they're talking about the city
[1:10:53] he's founded they're talking about
[1:10:55] Jerusalem and as they would see that as
[1:10:57] a holy city we know he's talking about a
[1:10:59] spiritual Zion say law
[1:11:01] it says I verse 4 I will make mention of
[1:11:04] Rahab and Babylon to them that know me
[1:11:07] behold philistia and Tyree with Ethiopia
[1:11:11] this man was born there I'm just going
[1:11:13] to keep reading and come back to and of
[1:11:15] Zion it shall be said this and that man
[1:11:17] was born in her listen to what it's
[1:11:19] saying and the highest himself shall
[1:11:22] establish her blessed is the man whose
[1:11:25] hope is in the Lord whose trust is in
[1:11:27] the Lord and not flesh as his arm and
[1:11:30] not trusted in man not in his dwellings
[1:11:33] of Jacob not in the natural tree but the
[1:11:35] one that God has established the Lord
[1:11:38] shall count
[1:11:40] when he rideth up the people when he
[1:11:43] does his family tree when he reckons
[1:11:45] their genealogy that this man was born
[1:11:48] there
[1:11:51] that say law is an interlude and it says
[1:11:53] as well the singers as the players on
[1:11:56] the instrument shall be there
[1:11:58] all my Springs
[1:12:01] are in thee
[1:12:03] listen what it means the source of my
[1:12:06] life
[1:12:07] brings from you
[1:12:09] all those that dwell in tents of Jacob
[1:12:12] and Tabernacles of Jacob and all those
[1:12:14] in the dwellings of Israel could all
[1:12:16] reckon themselves back to Israel but now
[1:12:19] there's a different pronouncement all my
[1:12:23] life the source of my life Springs from
[1:12:27] Zion my birthplace
[1:12:30] Zion is my birthplace wait I thought you
[1:12:33] were born in Nazareth I thought you were
[1:12:35] born in Bethlehem I thought you were
[1:12:37] born in philisto I thought you're no no
[1:12:39] no no no no my life Zion is my
[1:12:41] birthplace
[1:12:42] did I ever tell you about my story when
[1:12:44] I met the owner of Texas the steak steak
[1:12:46] house in Phoenix
[1:12:47] it's just it's all Texas stuff right so
[1:12:49] you know it's the best ever and uh and
[1:12:52] so it's all Texas stuff and I lived
[1:12:54] there for long enough I can I can poke
[1:12:55] at him a little bit
[1:12:57] I got children born there so my argument
[1:12:58] to this guy was he goes oh you were born
[1:13:00] in Texas we were just hitting it off
[1:13:01] about Texas right all this Texas bravado
[1:13:03] and then come to find and says well
[1:13:04] where were you born
[1:13:06] Flagstaff
[1:13:08] and he looked at me like I was some kind
[1:13:09] of interloper I think he's about to kick
[1:13:11] me out of the church
[1:13:12] and I said but I was born again in Texas
[1:13:15] and he said I'll accept that I I don't
[1:13:18] know what it did for me I didn't get a
[1:13:20] discount or nothing
[1:13:22] but there's a there's a new birth
[1:13:24] that no matter what your dwelling in
[1:13:26] Jacob was is all these are bragging Zion
[1:13:29] is my birthplace
[1:13:31] I know verse 4 may seem to be a little
[1:13:32] bit interesting I will make mention of
[1:13:34] Rahab and Babylon to them that know me
[1:13:36] behold philistia and Tyree with Ethiopia
[1:13:39] it says Egypt Babylonia philistia
[1:13:42] phenicia in Ethiopia are some of those
[1:13:45] Nations that know you
[1:13:48] think of all these nations so it's Ray
[1:13:49] habit it's not Rahab the Harlot but it
[1:13:51] speaks of Egypt Babylon Philistine
[1:13:54] phenicia Ethiopia it's naming all these
[1:13:57] surrounding regions he says these other
[1:14:00] nations these other people they're not
[1:14:02] born in Palestine they don't dwell in
[1:14:05] the dwellings of Jacob but this is what
[1:14:07] they're going to say I was born in Zion
[1:14:11] there's no privilege being born in Egypt
[1:14:13] there's no privilege being born in
[1:14:15] phenicia there was no privilege being
[1:14:17] born in Ethiopia there are all these
[1:14:19] other places oh you were born there oh
[1:14:20] what was it there was a it was a disc to
[1:14:22] say oh this man could anything good
[1:14:24] thing come out of Nazareth like there
[1:14:25] were certain stigmas attached to certain
[1:14:27] areas there was no privilege
[1:14:30] I think men can build cities in boast of
[1:14:32] them
[1:14:34] men can build churches and brag about
[1:14:36] them
[1:14:37] but Zion
[1:14:39] Zion is the birthplace of God's children
[1:14:43] Zion is the tree that we point to
[1:14:48] notice verses six five and six
[1:14:51] and we're closing I'm closing with this
[1:14:53] scripture
[1:14:54] end of Zion it shall be said
[1:14:57] this and that
[1:15:00] this man this woman from here and there
[1:15:03] this and that man
[1:15:04] this and that
[1:15:06] all these all these places were born in
[1:15:09] her
[1:15:11] and the highest think what I said in
[1:15:12] Zion it shall be said this man was born
[1:15:15] in her that man was born in her that
[1:15:18] woman was born in her that girl was born
[1:15:20] in her this man this woman that one you
[1:15:23] say they were born where in Zion wait I
[1:15:25] happen to know Batman was born in
[1:15:26] Prescott I happen to know that one was
[1:15:27] born in Minneapolis I happen to know
[1:15:29] this one was born there no no no no that
[1:15:31] man that woman was born again in Zion
[1:15:34] this sister this brother this young man
[1:15:37] this young lady was born again in Zion
[1:15:41] the Lord shall count
[1:15:45] the Lord shall count when he writes up
[1:15:48] his people that this man
[1:15:50] was born there
[1:15:53] listen as a church it is not our goal to
[1:15:55] count members we want to count the born
[1:15:57] ones
[1:15:59] when we when we do a register when we
[1:16:01] count our interest is in the born ones
[1:16:03] that this one was born again here men
[1:16:06] and women were born again not just born
[1:16:08] in this church listen I got to come back
[1:16:09] not a retraction but let me just add
[1:16:11] when you have a baby in this church
[1:16:13] we'll add their name to the directory
[1:16:15] all right
[1:16:17] all right we're adding names of the
[1:16:18] director the directory's getting longer
[1:16:19] right certain families are certainly
[1:16:21] helping that out right we got more that
[1:16:22] that entry is getting bigger but listen
[1:16:24] Jesus would look at you and say wow
[1:16:26] that's quite that's quite an entry and
[1:16:29] the Arizona Believers Church directory
[1:16:30] fantastic that's wonderful you must be
[1:16:32] born again
[1:16:35] every time we add a name to church
[1:16:37] directory by natural birth it's one more
[1:16:38] it's one more person we need to see a
[1:16:40] second birth for
[1:16:42] like well this is the church just got
[1:16:44] more the commission just expanded
[1:16:47] for all of these young young babies that
[1:16:49] we have in the church all these ones
[1:16:50] being born you know what tells us we've
[1:16:52] got we got more work to do why because
[1:16:54] that wasn't enough as long as we're here
[1:16:55] our interests see that that little one
[1:16:57] comes to know Christ
[1:17:01] count the ones
[1:17:03] born there
[1:17:06] count the ones
[1:17:08] that become citizens of Zion
[1:17:11] their birthplace
[1:17:13] and I say then let this church
[1:17:16] become a birthplace
[1:17:19] not to be born in this church to be born
[1:17:22] again in Zion
[1:17:23] and let it be a gathering of born ones
[1:17:27] let's stand
