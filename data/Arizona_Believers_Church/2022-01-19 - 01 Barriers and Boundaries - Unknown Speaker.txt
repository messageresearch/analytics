TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title is barriers and boundaries and there's a lot that is weighing in my heart to express on this subject matter and tonight we're just giving an introduction and laying a foundation but there's a lot of different ways that we can express this on barriers and boundaries and i want to approach it very elementary in the word of god just to recognize some characteristics of boundaries so that we can just start thinking along a particular lines and as you have needs in your heart or as you pray and seek the lord throughout the week and as you're praying for our services which i trust that you are and i know that you are because we can sense that pull as we go into the word of god and we sense it in our family that there is a weight there that is impressed upon us for your benefit uh you can be in prayer that god could tailor this for whatever needs you might have in your life whatever situations you're facing so there's a lot of different ways that this word can fit your life but we want to do it very introductory very foundational tonight and so again the subject is titled barriers and boundaries genesis chapter 1 verse 1 is thinking of just how much we've used these scriptures in the genesis of this church in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and so it's a chaotic mesh an amalgamation of just different things and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the water the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters now notice in the first day there's a division of light and dark now there's a division among waters and he says and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day god bless you you can be seated notice in this god is dividing things and setting things in their place and arranging the heavens even light and darkness and that's kind of the image that we'd like for you to hold in your in your mind as we approach this subject on barriers and boundaries that's the title um the subject maybe could be amplified in different ways but we're just introducing this tonight and as i've pondered it and as god has weighted me with this i've realized that this subject will uh help us to understand our relationship with god there's principles in this that'll that'll encourage us and liberate us in pursuing god's presence and desiring to see his promises fulfilled in our lives and so there's just a lot that we can gain from looking at this principle that'll ease us into a deeper relationship with the lord and then also there's a lot of ways that looking at this and maybe we could just automatically understand that a better relationship with christ will improve our relationships with each other right i mean wouldn't we agree that if christians are deeply in love with jesus christ that that ought to just translate to a better personal relationships whether it be among one another in the house of god or within our families uh but it also there's principles that help us in personal relationships and and as i have just this liberty tonight to speak uh freely with you and i can just relax i it to begin just to ex in our minds ponder the thought of these principles if you just think about your daily life what you do when you get up in the morning and whatever it is you would set forth to do maybe this is more relevant to us as adults but yet we could put in a language that children could certainly understand but from the very time that you get up you're navigating boundaries and you are respecting certain limits you're abiding by different rules and so our lives can be defined really our lives can be defined by rules and limits and boundaries and these different things and maybe just ways i've just pondered in my mind just ways to express it to you by way of example or analogy that can kind of get you thinking in the sense that we're uh i'm pondering it but after service a lot of our boys like to gather over here on the football field and they like to play a game of football just on this hard concrete parking lot pavement it's a wonder that we haven't set up triage for all the potential bumps and bruises and scrapes but they've done extremely well over the last year and a half in playing football uh fairly injury-free but one of the things that you learn we begin to play football is there has to be boundaries and and it's always interesting find someone who's just playing football for the first time they'll grab the ball just take off any way they want just try not to get tackled like ah well you're out of bounds and so you have to have a boundary you have to have lines and you have to have lines of scrimmage in ways that make sense to relate to certain things oh you can't be across that and you can't go this far you have to catch it before this line or you have to get it across this in order for there to be a touchdown that's that's the sense of boundaries or lines and one thing that can be extremely frustrating is when you're playing a game and you don't understand all the rules but the person you're playing does and the rules are not expressed to you until the moment in which that rule benefits the one who knows the rules the most it's like oh you can't make that move you're like really you made that one earlier oh yeah well i just forgot you're not allowed to make that move and so you want to know the rules you want to know the limits you want to know the boundaries when even when you're just playing a game because it's it's important to succeed to understand what the limits are in order to win the game you want to know what the rules and the boundaries are and one of the examples i was pondering and thinking to today of is that when it comes to just being able to drive a car and to make it from point a to point b and e to legally be able to drive and to safely drive um you have to understand boundaries and recognize signs and know that this is a one-way street that means you don't go the wrong way on this and this is what this light means and this sign and these even these lines in the road i don't know if it's so here and maybe by nod or show of hand you could kind of correct me but in the dallas fort worth area a double line in the hov which elliot calls a hover lane you weren't allowed to cross you couldn't cross a double line so it's signaling to you this is a this is a boundary that if you cross there's consequences i don't know if the double line means the same thing in phoenix ignorance is bliss in my case so don't tell me but there's things that you have to recognize as a boundary as a limit this is something that is set in order to moderate behavior to cause traffic to go a certain direction allow us to drive safely and if someone does not appreciate those or respect those then things can get chaotic and it seems that in the valley here on a regular basis there's a death or terrible accident from wrong-way drivers it seems to be almost endemic to our our area where there's always someone going the wrong way and that that for that to happen even signs or barriers can be confusing our boundaries aren't articulated very clear and you just all it takes is just a simple miss of a sign and you find yourself going the wrong way into traffic and so these are just ways for us to begin to think about the subject matter that i'm presenting to you this evening and in the sense that we've just expressed it let me put it this way it's very difficult to navigate the word of god without understanding boundaries very difficult to fully appreciate and understand the word of god if we do not uh appreciate barriers and know what they are so this is true also when it comes to driving or playing a game or sports or different things in life that have boundaries the same is so about the word of god how can i truly be successful in the word of god or make my way through it and get the full benefit of it if i don't understand boundaries and i'm not able to recognize barriers and really i know this is putting it and and i have the benefit of being able to speak tonight so i can really put it in how a way that uh maybe a suits that way i'm impressed by this but you truly can't even be successful in god's will for your life without understanding boundaries and for some of you might think well that's you're really putting in a weird way well maybe it's semantics maybe it's terminology but i want you to think about it that way we cannot fulfill god's will for our lives without identifying boundaries and also being able to identify barriers and maybe you're already kind of you'll be sensing that i am using them separately barriers and boundaries separately now in genesis chapter one in the beginning god is establishing if we could put this way the bounds of creation he says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth so we can see these things as coming into existence and then as god as these verses continue to unfold these first eight verses in particular if you read them god is bringing a division and placing where the heavens are where the earth is and and also the elements uh that make up these two uh these two distinct things the heaven and the earth and god is using he's putting in place certain laws um it may not be evident as we read it uh from genesis chapter one but science has examined creation and has been able to very accurately determine that there are laws that bind creation the creation itself is operating by certain rules and there's actually an order or hierarchy even to creation to where science can look at it and even identify what seems to be some sort of scheme of evolution all because of the order and the arrangement of god's creation and so in god in these first few verses that we've read and as these subsequent verses we're going to be reading god is establishing a specific framework that humanity's to exist within and and it just is so this is exactly the way that god arranged it i've heard it said here recently i was listening to something it may have been i'm a song or i may have been reading something and it was expressed well god could have done it this way but he chose to do it that way and i thought well we don't know that he could have done it this way because god does things in such a way to where he's expressing something about his nature and his character so he could say all day long well he could have just done this well we're maybe speculating in terms of what god could have done because there's certain things that god cannot do if that kind of locks you up a little bit he can't lie so there's certain things that god will not do or that he cannot do and so when god is creating he's establishing this framework for us to live in and to uh to is will we well we won't get into it tonight but he expresses to creation of man humanity mankind that this was the realm that they were to exercise dominion within and that they were going to have power over and so god is arranging things and ordering things and it says in first corinthians chapter 14 verse 33 and i and i for i meant to say it and and i uh forgot so i'll just say it now we were thoroughly blessed this past sunday with the two services that we had i enjoyed having an evening service i thought it was wonderful i enjoyed the word of god as brother jason watkins ministered to us i thought it was could be made applicable wherever we were in our lives and i greatly appreciated that and i i'm very grateful for the ministry that we had this weekend i meant to say that somehow it just popped in my mind just now don't let that stumble you i can multitask but in first corinthians chapter 14 verse 33 it says for god is not the author of confusion but of peace that's harmony accord confusion speaks of instability god is not the author of disorder instability but of peace as in all churches of the saints so this is god's inherit character he is not the author he is not the creator he is not the progenitor of confusion but he is the author and the creator of peace where there's harmony and accord where things fit together and are arranged in a harmonious way for a benefit for something beautiful that's what god does but he does not offer confusion now paul is dealing with something in particular here in chapter 14 but let's just take from that a characteristic of god and we see it in genesis chapter one that god brings order out of chaos in the beginning the world was without form and it was without void the earth was and there was darkness and then god's spirit begins to move upon the face of the water so though there was chaos that existed god's spirit moving is now going to arrange things and bring things out of the chaos in the voidness the emptiness the disorder the disconcordant things and the lack of harmony god's spirit is going to bring harmony so god his spirit moves upon something and then it remarkable that god moved upon the face of the waters and he's going to speak and from these dynamics order's going to come because this is god he is the author of peace and not confusion which is instability and disorder so when you see that um that share that brother jason was even talking about how you're supposed to be going one way you're supposed to be in continuity with the spirit it's when we go against that that the billows form and what was it called an instability experiment where it's expressing how things become unstable god doesn't author that you have added the agreed ingredient for instability then just seven verses later in verse 40 paul expresses this again let all things be done decently in the right manner let all things be done decently and in order let it have a particular arrangement it's fixed it may have a post it speaks about being at a post or a particular rank uh in a post of duty that everything be done decently and in order why because that's the spirit of god if it says god is not the author of confusion but of peace then paul is saying then we likewise must be expressing this attribute and characteristic even with respect to our church services with respect to church order and the in the operation of gifts as paul is identifying him here things must be done decently in order in order that it might be expressing the spirit of god which itself is orderly which does not offer confusion which does not gender strife and cause things to be out of out of harmony with one another he's saying let us be in our positions and in our place and brother branham addressing a very similar subject matter in greater than solomon is here he says pentecostal people let me say this with love so you know it's going to sting a little bit that's the reason you're not getting anywhere see you've got gifts you baptist the same way now think about this how we talked before about how the power is still in the church but we get out of practice with it and so there's still power but when you don't use it you lose it you forget about it and it's a kind of a similar thing here the gifts that's in the church god give the church the power but he never took it away from the church so there's power available i can show you where he give it to the church you show me where he took it away you've got the power but you don't know how to use it and he says you're not reverent enough this is speaking directly to confusion and disorder and chaos and things just being done to promote themselves especially with the operation of gifts within the pentecostal ranks he said that's the reason you all speaking with tongues you just use it anyway some be speaking in tongues other doing this he says in just like a babylon a babel a confusing thing he says don't do that put those things in their places put all your gifts in there your teachers your apostles and this is a principle that we can apply into any area of our lives put everything in its place and then operate in decency and an order so put everything in its place a place for everything and everything in its place that's the best way to organize it's the best way to keep clean is have a place for everything and then put everything in its place he says put everything in its place and then operate in decency and in order and this is what really drew me to this statement you'll find god is a god of order and he will bring it the right thing up then so god is a god of order god is a god of arrangements he's a god of boundaries he's a god of even limitations he's a god of being able to put things in relation to one another so that they bring out the best in each other that god knows just where to fix something and put it next to something else so that this thing operated in its place uh brings out a benefit and this thing operating it's a place brings out a benefit but them operating in proximity to each other amplify and bring something greater out of it god knows how to do that and there's things that we might be able to do with our gifts and with our talents with our desires and our motives and objectives and there's things that we feel like i can accomplish this i can do this and you can set forth to do that and have some measure of success in it but god can look at and say oh if i can just get you placed here in this right place you can be exponentially more of a benefit and a blessing and we are we are called to to thrive we are called to have a fruitful bow and to live overcoming lives and not just survive and not just be those who are just barely getting by so there's a way that we can live where we're just getting by and we're happy with that right some of us pat ourselves on the back when we just survive just just making it hallelujah brother aaron we're surviving but listen god wants you to be more than a conqueror i mean he wants he wants you to excel above difficulties he wants you to to see things as challenges and overcome in them and be victorious so there is a there is a blessing and there's a praise when we get by there's a blessing and there's a praise when we just eke out a victory but let's build on that victory and go forward to greater victories to overcome things that seem to be insurmountable to to arise above them in a more victorious way because i believe that god wants to place us in our positions and then exercise us in those places so that we can get a hundred percent out of our lives i believe that's what the hour that we're living in is a hundred percent and so god is a god of order and that's what we begin to see unfold in genesis chapter one as we read these first eight verses god is a god of order very meticulous god even in creation just to say in the beginning god created and so we just had we had i just it kind of just allude to everything very quickly there's actually a process where god says i'm going to put this here i'm going to put that there we've even heard it dramatized brother brown talking about how he breaks a little clinker off he says all right go go stop right to a point where god's watching out over these things now verse 9 and this is after the the second day it says and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place so now the waters are going to go to one place and let the dry land appear and it was so it this image that strikes the your mind is that there's uh i think you could even look at it in the beginning there was just voidness and there was maybe land and mass and things mixed together even to where some speculate might have been kind of muddy and just a heavy substance but here god is like almost like sifting out and separating land and water in dry land appears it's not covered over with water it's not muddy it's not boggy but dry land appears and every and the water is gathered to one place and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together the water called he sees and god saw that it was good in doing this i want you to catch this at the very beginning and regardless of just how much this dry land and these seas have changed through tectonic shifts and floods and things i want you to recognize that god is putting together the very basic elements of boundaries that god is putting together the elements of borders and so the end and he's putting things in such a way to where they relate to one another so these things this arrangement is essential to life so it's not arbitrary and god god didn't just kind of spin the earth around and kind of see where everything's splattered and say oh we got land here and we got this there no god is doing it to be for essential to life and and just to identify this and if i seem to be if i'm not as uh precise as i should be tonight and it seemed to be and i don't quite convey this to your hearts i i have 100 confidence the holy ghost can just make up the difference but i want to just take a little bit of a shift here because i want you to recognize that in creating and god creates the seas and the dry land god knows he's going to use this so he's very intentional the way that he's arranging these things and these are the elements of borders i don't want to get too deep in this but in exodus chapter 23 verses 30 and 31 by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land so this is something god's going to give israel as a possession says and i will set thy bounds from the red sea even under the sea of the philistines and from the desert unto the river for i will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee this is god establishing the borders of israel and in very simple language he's saying i'm i'm going to give you this land to inherit i will set your bounds this is god saying he's going to do it and if you pondered a little bit the whole earth is god's right so the whole world is at god's disposal and god but yet god is not saying to israel that everything is yours i'm going to give everything to you could possess the entirety of it you can have it all but he's telling them that i'm going to set your borders and your boundaries and we could look at him and say well that was very limiting this is a very precise border i mean why didn't he give it to all the way to uh to the himalayas and why didn't he give it all away to this sea and why didn't he give it all the way to the the ocean and give it all the way to this pole or this coast but yet he confines it very narrowly and if you read in other places in numbers 34 there's a lot more detail to it in such a way the precision of the details of this land that god's going to give him when god expresses it through his prophets and it's expressed in the word even in in numbers 34 and ezekiel 47 you can actually outline the borders of israel you say i'm going to go from here to here i'm going to go from here to here and this is how precise god is he's he's a map maker and he's saying these are the bounds these are your boundaries that i'm going to set for israel you even find in the book of joshua i think maybe even around chapter 13. joshua's giving specific divisions within these borders to different tribes he said you're going to have this part and they can look on a map and say this is my boundary this is your boundary this is how far we're going to go this is how far we're going to go and it's all speaking to something that's within god's heart that he looks at the entire earth and instead of telling israel hey now that you're out of egypt you could just have it all and eventually get back over there and take over egypt he set parameters for him and and he never you'll find and maybe get a little bit ahead of myself but god once god is once god gives israel its boundaries he's not directing them to set forth to go out and tear other people's boundaries down he actually tells them to respect the boundaries of edom the different ones as he's passing through like you're to honor this year to respect us i'm giving you land and it never says now that you've got this figured out let's go over here and take care of the syrians and let's go over here and take care of the germans and there was this uh manifest destiny in israel that they were just to increase until they completely took the entire earth and every it was conquered um by god on behalf of israel or by israel on behalf of god we don't find that conquest narrative within the boundaries that god is setting for israel i think in some ways i might i might be given a lot of not that i'm hiding anything but just giving a lot to you to ponder giving a lot away in terms of how god's dealt with me so that says in psalms chapter 33 verses 6 and 7 again we're still wanting to bring up on this image of god gathering the seas to one place and the dry land to another this is the word of god now establishing a sea and then creating dry land and then god comes later and tells israel your land is going to be to this sea to this other sea and to this river and you're going to possess this land and psalms 33 verses 6 and 7 by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth that's how we believe the earth and the the heavens have come into existence by faith we believe that and then verse 7 he gathered the waters of the sea together as a heap he layeth up the depth in storehouses so this is god's word that even lays up the depth of water that would be um subterranean that would be in the uh but beneath the earth it is the word of god i want you to catch in verse six it is the word of god that has done this it's the word of god that has gathered the waters of the sea together as a heap it's the word of god that has gathered together the lands it's the word of god that holds the water beneath it is all by the word of god so god's word when it was spoken separates light from darkness god's word when it was spoken begins to bring land forth out of water and it's the word of god then that established those boundaries it's the word of god that established the bounds of the people of israel it's the word of god that establishes boundaries within creation and it's the word of god that establishes boundaries among his creation so we see it in creation things that are physical but then those of us be in his creation and among his people it's the word of god that establishes boundaries among us i'm very disciplined to use that word because i think it's important to look at it in the context of a boundary so continuing on i think i have it on the slide verse 14. but then as we you could just read how that god then speaks to the earth and the earth is bringing forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind the earth brings forth grass the trees bring forth fruit the seed is in itself and god sees that it's good and that's the third day now in the fourth day in verse 14 we'll read to verse 19 and everyone's happy tonight right so good to see all of you tonight appreciate each one of you miss those that aren't here genesis chapter 1 verses 14 to 19 continue on notice how beautiful this is and there's some words he's using here that speak to god's nature and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night this is something that god does it divides using lights in the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be these lights in the heavens let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years this is god's intent in the beginning that i am not just going to have one endless season or one endless day or one endless time but i'm going to have things that can be set be indicators of signs and seasons in light days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so so there's intent and purpose to the way god's arranging these things and god made two great lights the greater light to rule now notice the language now you have to divide now you have to rule this is a very important to rule is to set limits and to have boundaries and to enforce order to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and you could say to rule over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the fourth day so god now as moses is writing this narrative of god creating he's speaking and and there's things that's taking place to bring a division and in the division and the creation of lights in the heavens it's to be for sign seasons days and years to be it's to be for light to the earth and they're going to have certain characteristics in order to rule the sun is going to have a particular characteristic to rule the day the moon is going to have a particular characteristic to to rule the night and they're there in order to bring a division from light and darkness and this is very natural this is even very scientific and very uh physical these things that god is doing and so this is god doing this in job chapter 26 verse 10 it says he compasseth the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an end maybe he seems to be somewhat of a cryptic saying by job but he marks out the horizon on the face of the water is for a boundary between light and dark and that's what we see when we look out and we know that the earth isn't flat right you just never know these days ideas that people come up with but we know that the earth is there's curvature to the earth right we believe that here right we believe the earth okay you just never know right captain you've seen it on the you know the earth is around and you're so he's identifying on the horizon that as you look out it's almost as if when we look we can see a division we see sometimes even when the sun is setting what do we think as soon as that sun goes down it starts to get darker we can almost imagine what the whole world is now slipped into darkness because the sun has disappeared but it at that mark is sun it's sunrise to somebody else the setting sun to us is a rising sun to somebody else and this is what job is actually talking about he marks out the horizon on the face of the waters and that's what sets the boundary between light and day and god is doing this in genesis he's saying there's going to be a setting of a sun there's going to be a horizon and this is going to form a distinction and a boundary between night and day and this is how we're going to know when the sun sets when a day is ending when a day is beginning when the sun is rising he marks out the horizon on the face of the waters to be a boundary between light and dark it says in psalm 74 verses 16 and 17 the day is thine the night also is thine this is god speaking of god the nature of god the character thou has prepared the light and the sun thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter this is god creating and god is not just being random with it and saying all right we're just going to throw my words out into the abyss and then whatever begins to form and whatever begins to coagulate together and whatever begins to take shape that's just the way that it's going to be or some people actually think god is that way he's just kind of arbitrary just kind of throws all our names in the air and god just kind of starts grasping and whatever he grabs and pulls out those are the ones that he's elected and some think that even god spoke and then things just have been colliding ever since he spoke and this is just the randomization of atoms colliding together what we're experiencing today is just the lottery of evolution and but god is not that way he is not off in the distance just watching things collide and everything take place and take shape but he is a god that set the borders of the earth he's a god that made summer in winter he's the one that prepared the light and the sun this is just very simple tonight boundaries are of god it's part of his character it's part of his nature he he god is being very deliberate when he has set things in in motion he says i will let the sun do this to accomplish the person purpose i'll let the light the moon do this to accomplish a purpose and i'll actually allow things to revolve and to move and to orbit in such a way where there's always a boundary always a circuit there's always an order that they follow that can be timed that can be observed and so these are things that are inherent in god's nature he is a boundaries are of god and boundaries in creation and i know i'm doing maybe a very uh simple job of identifying them tonight in these few scriptures but boundaries in creation and god's use of boundaries in creation reflects god's use of boundaries in his word he established him in genesis 1. he never leaves it he doesn't make everything very very strict and in order i'm going to put this here i'm put that there and everything is in its place and everything's in a particular line and you're this seed and you bring forth this way you're that seed you bring forth that way god is establishing certain boundaries in the beginning say you're this stay that way you're that stay that way and god doesn't vary from that as a matter of fact we could say this is genesis is the seed chapter of the bible or the seed book of the bible the from this point on god said these are the boundaries of my word this is what i want you to do and the rest of it is a story of man finding its way beyond those boundaries fighting with those boundaries trying to tear down those boundaries and the consequences when man leaves those boundaries because god is a god of boundaries and then god then establishes this pattern in the beginning and i know you could you could argue that well that you're just being very self-serving brother aaron to use that terminology in that language about the creation story to suit your purpose and speaking about barriers and boundaries and i'd say is it that obvious and i wouldn't argue with it okay but i think we can look at and say yes this these scriptures are speaking to the nature of god to set a boundary the nature of god to establish borders the nature of god to set rules and divisions and limitations uh and do this and do that these are all things that he puts in his word and as god does that in genesis chapter one as it unfolds in the subsequent chapters god maintains this characteristic as a god of order a god of peace he offers peace not confusion he instructs us in the new testament to do everything decently and in order and so these this is a principle that god does not leave when it comes to christianity it is not a principle that god leaves when it comes to his son when christ was on earth there's things that you can recognize in jesus christ and his ministry that god is still very clearly following parameters jesus even goes so far says i don't do anything unless god shows me first do you realize that's jesus christ respecting a boundary now continuing on this this visual image of creation and genesis chapter 1 as we have read these several verses in the message paradox because again that what has really connected these things together for me is god taking the moon i just go ahead and read it again he sets them the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night and and it says in verse 18 to rule over the day and to rule over that and to divide the light from the darkness and so these are bounds these are borders these are things that are set in creation so we could use the sun as an example but i want to use i want to use the moon to recognize that in this characterization of the moon that it speaks of boundaries and it speaks of an agent that enforces boundaries in the message paradox this is god's creative hand it says in god brother braham says that god has put the moon over the tides and set the boundaries and they cannot pass that boundary where god draw the line nice and anyone who's been near tidal waters or lived on the coast we can be it maybe it becomes common but i'm amazed at how they can time the tides and just how precise they could be they say oh no you got to just build it to here and they and they know exactly how they need to build it in order to be in harmony with tides with the waters moving in and out and what does it it's the moon it's the position of the moon that is is dictating uh and there's a lot that goes into it but that is just really a simplification of the process that this the moon is ruling over the tides and it sets these boundaries and they cannot pass the waters do not pass that boundary where god draw the line and said see you can come this close but you cannot take the rest of it for i've put my guard over you now we'll get into some other scriptures that brother brahms identifying to where the moon is operating one part and god's word is operating the whole and this is well you can only come that far he says that moon he says millions of miles from the earth i believe it's closer to maybe 300 000 miles from the earth but he says millions of miles from the earth calls to that sea and it sets its boundaries and controls it he says incredible by by god placing the moon where he did it sets boundaries it controls certain things he says it's incredible he's calling it a paradox what is on that moon when just a few miles off the earth all gravitation all air everything else leaves goes out into space where there's not even air for millions and millions and multiplied millions of miles this just this expanse of the universe no oxygen a vacuum but yet the moon is held right there and it controls he says yet it controls it so the moon being tethered to the earth and you could and signs can say well it's it's gravity right just arbitrary right it just happened that way but yet god has arranged these things god has put these things in their places and allowed them to be in a particular way even the size of the moon in relation to the earth is incredible when you look into science and the universe and he says it controls it said you can go so far but you can't go any further for i'm the guard of god i'm the watchdog that sets here you cannot pass these boundaries in a very positive sense the moon is is ordered by god to be a gatekeeper of the tides he is ordered to be he calls it a watchdog that's going to set there and make sure the water moves in a particular way according to certain times so it can accomplish god's will or the ecosystem the purpose of it on earth and so according to genesis chapter one the moon was given was created and made to give light during the night and this moon in its position in relationship to the earth is reflecting the light of the sun and so the sun it being reflected by the moon is what gives us the the light at night and the moon does a tremendous job ex of radiating and expressing and radiating the light of the of the sun to give us light at night now it's not a greater light it's a lesser light so it's not trying to take the place of the sun but the moon is there to give light at night but then we also see that the moon was given for seasons for days and years but then also seasons this is the moon the moon plays this critical role in even the seasons that we experience and i believe it's a full from new moon from moon to new moon this the full phase of a full moon to a new moon takes 29 and a half days i think the the for the the full uh um orbit is around 27 days but for the phase of the moon to go from full moon moon to new moon is 29 and a half days and then you begin to recognize why the hebrews keep a calendar a very strict calendar of 30 days and then in our a gregorian and a calendar it's a little bit different but you can see god said it there that it could actually help us time seasons days and years that's why it's there and brother branham begins to identify something about the moon this nature god put it there and hung it there it wasn't by chance it wasn't this gigantic uh star hurling through the galaxy and it just got too close to the earth kind of kind of got sucked there and it kind of been rounded off over time that's not how it got there but the grab god placed it there and the gravitational pull of the moon actually helps hold the earth in its place by the moon being where it's at and the the the force that it exerts upon the earth it actually holds the earth in its tilt it holds the earth in its place and they speculate and i think they do so uh reason for great reason and maybe i say speculation but uh they have never actually tested it to see whether or not this would actually happen in other words they haven't moved the moon uh the the power of the moon without the moon stabilizing power the earth's tilt would shift and they say well it could shift in such a way to where we have no seasons at all just one season maybe it could be very mild season they speculate but then also it could shift too far to where you have extreme seasons so the moon in its place is what gives makes earth a place of habitation and though there could be a lot of talk of global warming and extreme heat and things getting hot and things getting very cold the tilt of the earth is is moderated and held in place by the by the moon and without the moon we wouldn't have seasons or we would have seasons so extreme that life could not inhabit either too hot or too cold to where life could not inhabit this globe these are things that the moon does this is god's purpose of hanging the moon there and placing in relation to the earth and brother brahms identifying how the moon is important in controlling the tidal waters of the earth and even in controlling the tidal waters of the earth it's vital to the balance of the ecosystem that exists along the coast that exist within the waters without it you wouldn't have a cleaning you wouldn't have a purging without actually tidal waters you wouldn't be able to have the the the life uh the systems of life and the ecosystem that exist within waters some of them would go completely barren there'd be no fish there'd be no uh ecology that could be enjoyed or things that could be taken from the water that man could use these are things that god sets in there and so the moon is vital in establishing and honoring and making boundaries fruitful can you can you catch this god is doing this he's very deliberate is he wanting to see these things expressed in relationships moons stay in your place you've got to stay in your place so that waters can do their job and they got to work with a certain circuitry and everything in its place is operating in such a way to create life on earth it says in proverbs chapter 8 verse 29 and brother bam seems to be referring to this verse quite often when he talks about this when he gave when he gave to the sea his decree and who's speaking here his wisdom says i was there when he did this the word of god was there the wisdom of god was there when god created when god formed he was there in the beginning even before there was anything it's this beautiful picture and this chapter about wisdom and he was there wisdom the word of god was there when he gave to the see his decree so he's decreed to the sea that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth what binds it together god's word and science can say oh no no no that's not it what's doing it is the force of the earth's rotation and gravity of the moon and of the sun and all this is actually holding the word and it's the water in its place and that's what keeps the water where it was and so it's science that does it and like well no science is explaining it you're using science doesn't do anything science is explaining it science is telling us how it happened science has broken to god's great laboratory listen don't always be so negative and harsh against science they broke into god's laboratory you could just slow down enough to listen say oh if science is saying that's fact let me filter it through the truth and the word and sometimes you could come away with some really invigorating energizing things because science is just playing with the materials god gave them and so scientists said no no this is actually what do it is this force and that force and this and that and we're like right the word of god because the word of god actually is putting causing things to be and putting them in their place so whatever explanation science wants to give us as to how the waters are staying where they are and it just doesn't flow all over the globe and everything turned upside down in every which way we're saying the word of god told the sea and gave it a decree to not pass this place when he appointed the foundations of the earth this is god's word that did this and the sermons show us the father and it will satisfy us billy graham says look at the world how it folds around every 24 hours it turns like this and every 365 days it goes around the equator i guess there's a lot here that he's alluding to in terms of our circuitry around the sun and then even the rotation the earth itself rotating in a 24-hour period what in the world hold it up there what is it what keeps it there because god said so god said so so it's there god's word put it there and it remains there now science tries to figure out why and they come up with some great explanations right but what put it there god's word did he set the moon yonder and said moon i want you to watch over. now this is god now being very deliberate when he creates earth everything is in its place even the timing of earth to where we can wrote we could time the rotation of the earth and it's 24 hours and then the circuitry around the sun so many days why because god in the beginning timed it it's god's watch it's god's timepiece god timed it put everything in place creation is so remarkable that they can say just all right just wait there's gonna be a meteor shower at a particular time right here where we're standing let's say just wait in so many years you're going to see a comet pass by and they can tell you how long it's going to take to see it again why boundaries powers limits orders cycles seasons all these things put in their place he's appointed the foundations of the earth he's given his commandment that things would be where it is and god said so and he tells the moon watch over so the moon has a responsibility for honoring and watching over being a watchdog over something and it has a responsibility of exerting a force to keep god's word effective or in its place i'm skipping just a little bit on this next slide to this statement brother bam just kind of amplifying a little bit about the the moon he says god said moon you watch and set its boundaries and it can't pass and then notice this god sets his boundaries how do you know your boundary this gets this escalates real quick how do you know your boundary line not setting tonight to make your decision for christ or turn away from him turn away for your last time i thought we were talking about the solar system brother branham moon you watch set its boundary that it can't pass god sets his boundaries god has limits god has boundaries we could argue oh god is long-suffering and god does this and but then god is he brother ramsay's even say listen god is long suffering god is merciful his mercies are renewed every morning but he says there's a boundary line that someone could cross and turn away from christ for the last time that certainly would get our attention actually i i've marveled at as i've pondered this subject and said in this subject for for some time now just how that in one sense and again i just have such liberty to share these things knowing that i i hopefully would have time to amplify it later in one sense god is boundless there's no bounds there's no limps there's no boundaries and there's a way that i want to emphasize it hopefully in the future to look at this boundless god and this limitless aspect but yet somehow god reduces himself and constricts himself but then he's operating this limitless god is operating within a certain capacity to express that limitlessness he has to otherwise we would never fathom him at all do you realize that that where we're existing tonight and where we are today as a people that if god existed in the eternities as an eternal god without bounds and without limitation and yet somehow we came here as we are today unless god would confine himself and restrict himself and operate by certain parameters we would never know him so it's actually his boundaries that make god oh god if he could help me see the love of god that god is actually using boundaries so that we could know him and relate to him god sets his boundaries how do you know your boundary line's not set tonight to make your decision for christ or turn away from him for your last time he says there's a line drawn a plumb line says it again god sets his boundaries god is in his nature can we say a man to boundaries are of god god set his boundaries and we see his boundaries are in nature that god set boundaries in nature for specific purposes then unless there was a particular boundary he had to place the earth here he had to allow the earth to do certain seasons and cycles in order that the sun could provide the appropriate light to earth and there could be the right mixture of oxygen and the right mixture of these things god had to do it in such a way to where life would come forth and things it wasn't just uh it's not in a way of saying it's just survival of the fittest and whoever strongest prevails and and first come first serve and this that and it's not just this anarchy and and might rules right and and all these different ways that we try to conjure up god is a god of order a god of boundaries god is in his nature nature expresses to us order and semblances and arrangements and continuity and circuitry and harmony harmony it's beautiful when you see something even if you use mathematics math is in everything and the way that god has created earth and the and the way that math can i be come up in everything and how you can use math or solve just about any problem don't get scared school kids it's it's okay math is a good thing but it's everywhere when am i ever going to use this use it every day you just don't realize it because it's in there it's part of god's nature it's part of god's program the boundaries are of god in job chapter 38 verses 8 to 11 i have it from the living bible he says this who decreed his job his answer to job where were you and getting job to understand in some way his significance contrasted by his insignificance to understand where his significance is derived and where his limitations are so he could properly understand and give glory to god and recognize himself and value himself in the light of the position he has in god and not in his accomplishments on earth who decreed the boundaries of the seas when they gust from the depths god did who decreed the boundaries of the seas when they gushed forth from the depths and the king james speaks of as one giving birth he says who clothed them with clouds and thick darkness embard them by limiting their shores and said thus far and no farther shall you come and here shall your proud wave stop who does that god does he didn't tell the waves well if you're strong enough and you could do it just take over didn't tell the winds if you're strong enough you can do it just take over you didn't tell the sun if you're strong enough you could do it take over god set things decreed the boundaries of the seas it says and he barred them by limiting their shores barred them you can go thus far and no farther shall you come this is god that's now speaking it's god that's established god is a god of boundaries god expresses in his creation by his own word setting up boundaries for those of you taking notes and being very astute to consider our subject you might recall that the title was barriers and boundaries and to this point you might be wondering well are they one and the same are we talking about the same thing when are you going to talk about barriers but i'm using this language and i realize it could just be terminology and you may use something different you might borders boundaries barriers and uh whatever you might want to come up with it's just a it's just a language we get on the same page using this terminology so that the truth can be conveyed to you not that we would walk away from here saying now you realize there's a doctrine of barriers and we got to get that right i'll just catch the truth the truth that i'm trying to express to the principle and a barrier is i'm using it in boundary i'm recognizing as two different things and it's important in the context that i will place it in to recognize the difference i'm just going to share some very succinct short definitions to you as i'm closing tonight and i'll pick up on these later a boundary indicates the limits of something so a boundary is a limit of something as a scripture saying you can only go so far that's a limit that's a boundary to decree something and say i'm going to let you go here but you're going to have to stop you can't go any further god taking children of israel and saying i'm going to the land we get it all we get it all do we get mount everest do we get russia do we get china do we get japan oh do we get it no no no no i'm going to limit you a boundary indicates the limits of something a boundary is a dividing line we recognize a it's a boundaries a dividing line between two things and then a boundary can also express the furthest point of something to what from one boundary to another in america we say from sea to shining sea what have we established east and western boundaries the furthest point the furthest stretch of these contiguous states of the uh of america that this from seed to shining seed that this establishes a border it establishes a boundary that's what a boundary is think of it indicates the limits of something it's a dividing line it marks the furthest point that's a boundary but a barrier is something that it strucks a barrier is an obstacle a barrier is something that would block an entrance to something in that simple way it's easy to see a difference between a barrier and a boundary you could have in the united states you could have from sea to shining sea there's from border to border here's our borders here's our boundaries these are the bounds of these these united states but then if you're trying to get from one side to another you may you may come up against a barrier called the rocky mountains so i want to go from one side to another see well that's within your limits that's within your rights this is something this is indicates the furthest point this indicates the limits of something you're within your rights within your limits but yet there can be a barrier to it a barrier is an obstacle a bear is something that obstructs an entrance it's something that's available and if i could put it this way and i think this will just help us to sum it up and i'll have my introduction my foundation laid god uses boundaries satan uses barriers god is a god of boundaries satan is one of uh barriers he said well god does have limits right he has and and he has he has something he just said in his word and we begin to see these parameters that god says he gives us a commandment to baptize but he doesn't just say hey as long as you get wet right there's a boundary there there's something that is to be observed god is one that sets boundaries he's one that indicates the furthest point of something but satan is not one that honors boundaries nor is he one that has the right to set boundaries satan can only use barriers and let me express it to you this way and i think this will um this will be a way of sharing it with you that it can be applicable in your lives immediately some of us see a boundary and mistake it for a barrier and want to blow right through it it's actually a boundary it's a limit it's the furthest point it's something god said we see it as a barrier and we want to tear it down we want to go past it we could even sense resistance we could sense oh maybe this shouldn't happen or maybe this shouldn't be done or uh we're sensing but in our minds and i was having this conversation with the brother this week on how sometimes people do things in faith but really uh uh really what they're doing is they're just faking it and they really don't have the faith and they're setting forth to do something and just they're really in now they're really just trying to make something up and they're really not operating with perfect faith they're just pretending and it's all pretense it's not really faith and we have to be very careful that when we see something and we recognize that there's some kind of something limiting something obstructing we say oh oh that's just a barrier i'm just going to push that down i'm just going to get that out of the way you better be better be careful that may be god's boundary we might be sensing that and feeling that and we might have some sort of discomfort we might be recognizing them we just wanna say well bless god let's just plow right through it let's just mull that down let's just get through that by the by the the grace of god we're just gonna tunnel right through and say hold on god set a boundary could you imagine if moses said well god's already given us this land let's go get the other land that's ours let's we can take that later but let's go over here and get this there's a lot of oil out down here in saudi arabia there's a lot of a lot of silk over here in china and they're just going to go out on this conquest to get everything else and god wait a minute when i gave you the borders that was for a reason sometimes we see a boundary we think it's a barrier and we want to tear it down let's just let's just invert take that the opposite sometimes we see a we see a barrier and we think it's a boundary and what satan's trying to do is limit you obstruct you and keep you from fully possessing all the bounds of god's word now can you see why it'd be very important to be able to recognize the difference between a barrier and a boundary god's telling you on one hand it's not yours to take that's a boundary you want to respect that but on the other hand the devil's saying stop you can't have it that's a barrier you want to move past that in the masterpiece brother rams about the masterpiece family in the garden of eden so we could continue to read genesis chapter one we'd find that god created man and he placed them he set them there in the garden brother man called it a masterpiece family how beautiful it was he says the masterpiece was walled by the word god's word walled marked off in other words god's word formed a boundary there was a very literal boundary that god placed adam and the woman within and one sense you could say that it was a word boundary that they were to honor and observe rules that applied to the eating and partaking of something but it's very very vast and very beautiful when you look at even how god created the garden within eden and the symmetry and the location and the way that he would have arranged it but in this very real sense there might not be a literal wall that eve could have went up to and oh wow look at this and observe the beauty and the grandeur of a physical wall but there is a literal wall a boundary parameters limits right isn't that what walls ex mark out that's why you know that we we have walls we have borders we have boundaries they have physical bear uh boundaries that are marked as barriers to keep people within certain confines because it's marking out space he says the masterpiece was walled by the word god's word and the masterpiece itself of the family the masterpiece family was fortified by this word so now if we begin to think of god in terms of boundaries a lot of times what if we're negative or we always see the glass half full then what we begin to think is ah well this just limits me i can't do this i can't do that but listen the boundary becomes fortification it's not so much to keep you from going so far it's to keep other things from coming in the boundaries aren't necessarily just something to limit you but rather to fortify you to give you strength the masterpiece family's walled within certain boundaries and parameters and that is her fortification he says but the broken part speaks to the woman that was broke off the original the woman went out beyond that wall god set a boundary and the woman eased around that boundary she stepped over that boundary and as soon as she went beyond the boundary it gave satan a chance to mar creation he says it will not be on that wall it gives satan a chance to mar it the masterpiece family properly placed within the borders within the boundaries of god's word remain there safe but it's not until the woman went beyond the boundary that satan had a chance to mar her he could always just look in and so what would be his goal right just kind of look he wants you to move the boundary you know if you just you can actually come this way a little bit oh yeah by all means please right the devil's saying if the devil ever tells you after you right stop turn around go different door you know find another way to go because if the devil wants to get after you there's a catch and so satan will make it seem as oh no by all means please do this but what's he trying to do get you to go beyond the limits of something i've i've studied the message of the hour i think i've read every place where brother brown says boundaries boundary reading through all the places brother bam talks about barriers to understand how brother brown used this vernacular this terminology with respect to the word of god and i can say very very uh with great confidence today god has a boundary and satan's always trying to obscure it he's always trying to block it trying to get you to go beyond it and as long as you stay within the boundaries of god's word you're in a place that god can bless you but when god's boundaries are violated we leave this place of safety when boundaries are violated we leave a place of peace wait we're removing ourselves from the place because this is where you'll thrive this is where you'll grow this is how you can grow this is how you can live this is how you can live as an overcomer this is where my my power is available to you perfectly and the satan's job then is to violate boundaries and tear things down and to obscure the truth and to put us in a place where we're no longer in that zone that god can bless us in it's when we leave boundaries when boundaries are tore down and boundaries are violated this is a rich language that you could search through scripture and find that there's many different applications and support for this let's begin to ponder them ourselves as a church what it means to have boundaries with respect to the word of god what it would mean to have boundaries within the church of god why do we have boundaries when it comes to how service operates for a reason why would we have boundaries within uh within the church of god in terms of offices and who can serve in those offices and what gifts are expressed it's not because it's barriers to you being a christian it's boundaries to the word of god having preeminence brother mike if you could come by the michael tube i want to close with this statement but the man says for instance the moon if the moon would ever move out of its place the earth would be filled with water in a few moments the moon is rather like a watchdog of the sea he said it's bounds that it can't pass now this is this is going to take a different turn i think in the way that he expresses it and it's um i hope that you can um see the see it in the thought of barriers and boundaries because brother brown's using the moon being its position and when the moon turns from the earth here comes the tides and if the moon didn't catch it around the other side it would cover the earth so the moon stops and he turns his back to look around the other side of the world he's kind of just describing maybe in a storytelling way of how the moon in its rotation the earth and its and and how these things are working uh how they work together to where we're always seeing this one side he says here comes the waters coming in real fast and then he turns again he is jehovah's servant c stops and goes back to its place because it sees the perfect moving of jehovah this is something that's evident in creation the perfect moving of jehovah brother graham's identifying entitled waves and tidal waters and the ebbs and flows of rivers and tributaries and oceans and how the moon doing its part and each one of these things that god has said in creation he says it's the perfect moving of jehovah and what is what are they operating within their line they're operating within their uh within their order he says oh if we in the church as the members of the body of christ could only work in harmony like that you would say a great and mighty church of the living god all in one array filled with the holy spirit he says wouldn't it be wonderful every member of the body functioning just exactly to its place every member of the body functioning just exactly to its place remember every measure every part every gift to its place every gift helping the other every every member helping the other that would be wonderful that's what we want to see now in reading that we could read it and say oh the shackles are off i've been loosed let me operate let me let me do this let me do what i'm good at let me let me uh i want to be a blessing i oh every member of the body using every gift and helping in every way and every member helping the other slow down tap the brakes we all work together right we all we all work together if when there is a when there's there are meals that need to be prepared for a family in the church whether it be uh um you know the blessing of a child being born into the family or the loss of a family member or something happens and a meal meals need to be prepared not just one person takes the burden on and cooks all the meals right even though there may be one here who is more than capable of doing it and you could cook all the meals and you could plan the minion you could do everything for them but that's not how god's body works praise god that it doesn't work that way not one person is called to do it all you realize just even within the the the church of god like that the kind of the little this little bit of spin sometimes it's placed on the the role of a pastor within a church is that the pastor is a spiritual husband no not so your husband is a spiritual pastor [Music] because the pastor within the church doesn't fulfill all the duties that a husband does in a family you need deacons and trustees to finally round out the picture yeah that's what a husband does within a family and it takes other offices to perform those roles within a local church because it doesn't all become the burden of one person so you have to realize that yes there may be things that you can do there may be ways that you can be a blessing but don't to think that you're the only one that's going to do it don't think you're the only one that has to do it or the only one that can do it there's a way that we've all got to work together and what i'm describing and what i'm alluding to what i'm talking about is the only way that we can all work together functioning just exactly in its place every gift in its place everyone helping the other every member helping the other the only way we can do that is to stay in our lane to stay within the confines that god has called us to to stay within the bounds and the limits of god's word and to do it in respecting the boundaries of that gift respecting the limits of how god wants me to use it and respecting one another's gifts and callings brother mikey you might be able to attest to this that sometimes you can get a platform full of really really good talented gifted musicians but until they work learn how to play together it's just a muddled mess if this was trying to play lead this was trying to play lead this was trying to play lead this was trying to keep rhythm play lead and do the bass notes and everyone's just off trying to show everybody how good and talented the runs they can do and the licks they can do and is when everyone else is trying to show off on the platform you're never going to get that synchronization and that blending and that harmony so sometimes the greatest gifts are the ones that know just to stay in their place and to do their part knowing having confidence that i may never get mentioned my name ever may never get called i may never get any recognition at all but if i don't do my part then that person will never get to do their part and yeah that part may get all the attention that part may get all the accolades and all the all the praise and all the glory may go to some but what's important is you do your part it's blended so well with the sermons we are preaching on practice i think it's a wonderful opportunity to segue into this different subject of barriers and boundaries let's be inspired to do our part and realize you'll never be able to do your part until you recognize the boundaries that god has placed within your life and you'll never free someone else to do theirs if you're constantly disrespecting their boundaries it's important to know the difference between barriers and boundaries let's stand together this evening [Music] god bless you let's pray tonight with your heads bowed [Music] there is a a a wonderful presence here tonight and i believe that you can in this moment at this time just lift a hand to the lord and say lord this is what i need say lord i need this from you and in doing so humble yourself to his will for your life so i have this ambition i have this dream i want to go here i want to do this i want to do that i want to accomplish this i want to see this we have our bucket list as it were and the things that we want to accomplish the things that we want to do but wouldn't it be much more beautiful if you could just do what he wants you to do and say lord i've got ambitions i've got dreams i got things i know i can do and yeah it can be very frustrating i feel like i've got so much that i can add so much i can do so much i can give but [Music] don't you want to see it the way god sees it don't you want god to use it the way that he could use it [Music] my mind is suddenly becoming very conscious of different things even conversations i've had and desires and wishes that are expressed and i believe that god is speaking to us in a way to put us in a right path to accomplish his will and see great victories in our lives that's not an empty phrase i really believe that what we're looking at in the word of god to recognize god's will for our lives and what he has for us is going to lose the power in our lives and help us in so many different areas with our heads bowed let's pray the needs you've expressed by uplifted hand by a a pleading heart may you bring these needs before the lord in your own way tonight our gracious heavenly father barriers and boundaries are recorded throughout your word [Music] barrier after barrier of the enemy barriers man-made satan inspired have for thousands of years tried to keep man from walking within the borders of your word we see examples of men of god being enticed beyond limits and being called beyond borders and being called beyond boundaries that your word set being coaxed out of a place of safety into a place of fear and worry and doubt and vulnerability all because the devil wants us to override a boundary and lord there's times in our lives we find ourselves on the wrong side and we're groping and we're meandering and we see that there's something in the word of god that we can possess and that we can't have and we we set forward to try to achieve it or to walk in and to receive it and satan's so quick to throw up a roadblock and put barriers in our place lord i do not want one person under the sound of my voice tonight to slump their shoulders and kick a can at the foot of a satan's barrier thinking that god's word is not for them but may we recognize the barriers that satan has put in our lives and the things that are keeping us from possessing all the promises and with shoulders back and eyes of faith we can begin to ascend above or tunnel beneath or plow through or whatever it's going to take to get beyond the barrier into your promises lord may we begin to have that eagle eyesight to see beyond the barrier and pursue the truth lord as a young church we're just barely scratching the surface or there is not any depth even that has been reached in terms of what we can do as a church whether it be gifts or offices and whether it be the ministering of the word salvation in our families the deliverances of bondage lord i speak plainly as a pastor i see ones that are bound by things and they have become borders and boundaries and barriers that are simply the shackles of the devil and people are living their lives within those constraints and those confines and by cognitive dissonance people can tell themselves oh this is fine this is great everything's wonderful but oh god i would that your word once again as it spoke out in genesis 1 could speak out over people's lives and they could be loosed from these barriers that are keeping them from doing the things that they know that they ought to do as christians from being in fellowship in the house of god from exercising the faith that you have given them oh god may all the barriers of the enemy be destroyed [Music] lord not that there be no holds barred and anything goes and that we would just be this rampant fancy free footloose church but lord may we walk within the boundaries of your word knowing that within it is anything we need and everything we want i pray father that we could take a step forward as a church to go a little bit deeper lord if we're operating at six and a half percent may we take a step further lord and our goal to operate at 100 i commit us to you lord bless those that raised hands and offered a prayer and expressed things in their heart may they be benefited by this principle we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
