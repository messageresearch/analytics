TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the title today is a subtitle to the series we've been on called our family tree and I think this is the seventh service that we've been on this we might have had a half in there because a communion but our family tree and the subject today is a birthplace if you start with me in Genesis chapter 21 verse 33 this has been very familiar to us thus far and it says in Abraham planted a Grove in Beersheba and called there on the name of the Lord the Everlasting God this Grove this tamarisk tree as it's interpreted in some places was not just a sprig it was not just a tree but it meant something it was a Grove it's a place of hospitality and it was planted after the birth of Isaac who was the promised son and we've identified this through a number of services so I'm just mentioning that just to kind of maybe signal that a lot of this is building on some of the other things that we spoke on and it's a tree that symbolizes Christ and it's a tree that symbolizes family and even the family of Christ and our title is a birthplace so I just want to start there and now if you're waiting for me to start preaching I'm starting now but birthplace is a place of birth or origin it could be a town a country uh you know it and a city where one was born and just yesterday we were at a memorial service for brother Joe Dalton it's just a really beautiful service probably one of the best that I've been to whether Steve Dalton did a tremendous job in conducting the service and I I was think pondering even yesterday I was back at the place of my birth I was born in Flagstaff So when you say where's your birthplace where was your place of birth and often we're asked that question and we go back to where we were born and it stays with you you're going to be asked that question your entire life where were you born in and so it's your place of origin and in many ways we could call it a starting place where things begin and as we're looking at the subject of our family tree we've used the image of a family tree and a tree a family tree has to have some designated origin a place where it starts and there's different ways of how you can draw out a family tree and and chart your family but it's a family tree is basically detailing or listing and showing people who are born in some sort of line and so there's some sort of lineal descent we call it a lineage that's a line of descent it's a where you have an ancestor so you have to look at a beginning point and all those who come from that same line a bloodline some sort of relationship and uh to a lineage actually is literally a string or a line or thread and there's a couple examples I wanted to show you just to kind of give you the image I don't know how well these will render on the picture you could start with the first one I don't know how that you might be able to see this but in this example the way the family tree is drawn is it begins at the bottom and it might be and then from that place or that point of origin with this I can't remember if this is a night or something like that that we found but from this particular individual there comes from him a son or another son and they begin to chart it all out from a a the patriarch and then all those that descend after him and the next example it's done the same way it starts at the bottom and then it just grows up to the top so it starts with a root with something at the base and then the family tree is aligned there's this line that branches out this way there's a line that branches out that way and that's what a family tree designates we looked at Luke chapter 2 verse 4 it says Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea undo the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David Bethlehem being the the place the birthplace it was where they were to return because that's where their line of descent originated that was the place they had to come back to and it held the significance to them to the point to where this is where they returned at a particular time to uh either whether it be for a census whether it be for taxes if it was to be to show yourself or to report this was a place that Joseph returned because he was of the house and line or dissent an ancestor of David looked in the scripture how that family even in the New Testament were of the family of God all named after Christ that patriot means lineage or Kindred and so it's a line running all back all the way back to the same progenitor the same father or common origin I want you to think about that thought the starting starting place in a birthplace becomes a point of origin and a common origin we show these images to you it may have been at the very beginning of this so it might be good just to re uh refresh it in Isaiah chapter 11 verse 1. says and there shall come forth a rod this is a this is a um springing up it speaks of a branch that speaks of a tree shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse it's been cut down into a stump but there's going to come forth a new growth that's going to come forth a tree and the branch shall grow out of his roots are the pictures in that I thought there they are I didn't mean to put that with a animation I apologize but says there come out forth a rod out of the stima Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots now this is an artistic rendering artistic rendering of this particular scripture and they actually draw it to where there's a branch coming out of Jesse it's originated in him it's something that's growing from his bosom and then it's depicted then as growing forth and then Nathan comes forth or just all these other descendants are coming forth from from Jesse but then everyone that was born of him is represented in that tree and they say that this scripture is what originates the use of a tree to symbolize a family and all the descents it's this use is believed to be to believe to begin with this verse that this verse gave them the idea of the prior examples we gave it was from this verse to imagine uh Jesse as a stump something cut down and also new growth coming from him and growing up and all the sons that could be charted in that they used this scripture as the original and so there's this idea of the tree of Jesse and so the original use of the family tree as a some sort of schematic or representation of genealogy begin to be depicted as a tree of Jesse this is one of a very old uh piece of art I didn't draw it nor did Eliza even though she's a tremendous artist this is very very old and it depicts it again beginning at the base and at the bottom with Jesse and growing all the way up to where you have Mary with the with the baby Jesus at the Top This is a depiction of genealogy a line of dissent if you could see each one of these characters you might have to use your imagination but these are representing those who are in the line in the genealogy or the family of Jesse to represent this family tree because the promise was to come from the House of David and so in the subject of First Chronicles chapter five you want to begin to turn there I want to look at the the even the word genealogy which means line of descent actually means even pedigree which pedigree would be I don't know if it's French Pettigrew but the foot of a crane and the way that it Forks out and and how that represents a line of dissent it's a family's origin or lineage the pedigree of something is what do you come back to what do you what are you made of and this scripture uh has a lot a lot in it that we could get distracted by it but I just want to show how and there was a number of places we could have read how genealogy the Reckoning of genealogy comes up quite a bit in the Old Testament First Chronicles chapter 5 verses 1 and 2. basically explaining why Reuben the firstborn is not mentioned first in the accounting of the lineage but now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel for he was the first born but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his Birthright was given Unto the Sons of Joseph the son of Israel so genealogy dissent lineal descent those that come forth from a father is important because the firstborn held a significant place within the family and there's a lot that we could touch on especially I've posed this question before uh and I guess I'm going to be given the answer right now never mind I won't I won't I won't pose the question that keeps you in suspense doesn't it but uh as they this firstborn being the firstborn they had a a Birthright to an inheritance there was a double portion there were certain things that was reserved for the firstborn and so it's explaining why Reuben isn't necessarily mentioned first in the genealogy but it's showing us how important this place was and you'd want to know wait who was born first who's older I know in my family there's always some confusion as to the oldest son is that's me but the confusion stems from the fact that they had a second Son who's a junior and you don't normally have that usually the first son as a junior but there was a little bit of bartering going on as to how David became the name of my brother younger brother and so his Birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright so in the order of dissent even though he would be the firstborn his genealogy his place is not going to it's not going to be recorded and reckoned to him to get the birthright for Judah prevailed above his Brethren and of him came the chief ruler and we know that this is even speaking of Christ for he'll have to come for that but the birthright was Joseph so there's a it's showing that in this genealogy in this Reckoning this was something very important to the Jews and maybe I should have said that at the outset that's what I have in my mind as I look at this is I want you to begin to understand birth order and and and and and dissent and genealogy and how much it would have meant to a Jew that's one of the things I want to emphasize and so if you were to go back to First Chronicles chapter 3 and chapter 4 chapter 5 it's given the genealogy of David's family from whom the chief ruler even this this tribe David coming from and this origin was extremely important I just even think of terms of the promise to Abraham going all the way back to Abraham it was unto Abraham and his seed but not just any seed right just couldn't be anybody whose father was Abraham but it had to be through uh it had to be through Isaac so you had to know who Isaac was and where his descent was and then whether or not you descended from Isaac because that's going to determine whether or not this land is yours whether or not the promise is yours whether or not Deliverance is yours whether or not the Messiah is yours and what rights and privileges you would have within the family it was very important to know I know who my father was and who his father was and then eventually they just kind of summed it up with what our Father Abraham that there we are of Our Father Abraham in Ezra chapter 2 verses 61 and 62 this touches again on just how in the natural how precise they wanted to be and how specific they needed to keep this dissent and this genealogy pure and of the children of the priests the priest of habbai the children of cause the children of marciah which took a wife of the daughters of barcelai the gileadite and was called after their name these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy do I have a right to the priesthood can I serve as priests can I be traced back to Levi can I am I do I have the right kind of placing within the family by birth and the right kind of position in the family by birth in order to be positionally placed in my office according to my birth and it says but they were not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood and so what what kept them out because they had Blended in with a different family they Blended in with a different lineal descent and it would hybrid and it would mix in and it disqualified them from being in the service so they sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy they were actually going back to the register the archives the written genealogy and like as a census and saying well this one was born to this one and this one was born to this one and this was born to this one and they tried to go back and see if they could trace their family tree back to a particular origin that would dictate yes I can serve in the priesthood so we thought ancestry.com and all those things had went on reminds me brother Matthew just how much we used to Fellowship years ago on your attempts to find family and all it says nothing new this is they've been doing this for thousands of years trying to figure out who's who and who's who and where do they all fit together and so the Jews meticulously preserved their genealogy and and even in the genealogy of Christ in the Book of Matthew in the Book of Luke what does it do it basically with Matthew it kind of goes in descending order to show you the genealogy of Christ and then Luke takes it the other way the the um the ascending order and both of them kind of trying to show look we can trace Christ back to his origin according to the promise that he would be from the root of Jesse he would be from the House of David he would come from the tribe of Judah and I came across some interesting references in history how that it's believed that Herod during the time of his rule destroyed the public records of the genealogies in the temple archives so in the temple there was an archive of genealogies so if someone came and said you know I'm a levite I want to be a priest I said well who's your father and they could go back and they could determine whether or not he actually would have that right or that privilege and these things are well preserved and Herod himself not being one in the in the club so to speak her and the family was jealous of the purity of these Jews and how much they could prove their their birth and their origin the story is and I'm not trying to set it forth as as an absolute but the story is that he destroyed the record of these genealogies so that no one could go back and look at it and and this was lost to the Jews and so kind of the the history is that the Jews then had to kind of configure their family tree by memory uh they had to go by other private records that may have been incomplete someone says well I visited the temple archive and I wrote down our genealogy and and I have it here this is who your great great grandfather was and this is the line they descended from and so they had to try to piece together their family tree and to to make out a proper line of descent must have must have been almost impossible to go back and try to figure out well I know who my dad is I know who his dad was and I know who his dad was but then it can start getting pretty murky and then they start trying to go back and piece it all together and this is uh this is why some speculate that Paul referenced these things in first Timothy and Titus Chapter 3 first Timothy chapter 1 verse 4 neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do begin to Titus but avoid foolish questions Titus 3 9 avoid foolish questions what a great great admonishment avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and striving about the law for they are unprofitable and vain now I know you're saying oh brother Aaron you've kind of put yourself in a box because you've just spent a lot of time on genealogies well they're not endless it's not going to be endless but it's referring to just how much the actual natural record who my daddy was and who my grandfather was and who my great-grandfather was and all the pride that they would put in that family and their family name and this was important to a Jew in order to establish themselves so to be Vindicated to feel that they had a right in the promised land to have some sort of confidence in their position they would try to arrange it by who their line of descent and where they came from we are of Our Father Abraham as they say and we descend from this and we descend from that and Paul's saying these endless genealities and this contending about these lines of dissent are unprofitable in vain because he's introducing it we want to we're kind of pointing to it now he's introducing something else that means more but to a Jew your birth your natural birth was so prominent and so preeminent and so to be a part of the family tree to actually be a part of these records is they would be fighting about genealogy it wasn't something you could just be admitted into something very real something very natural you had to have been born of the same bloodline yet the proof paternity and so I've already mentioned this to the Jews you want to look at Luke chapter 3 to the Jews uh they're natural lineage back to Abraham was their bragging rights something that meant a lot to him so notice how John the Baptist even addresses this in Luke chapter 3 verses 7 to 9 then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him oh Generation of Vipers what is he he's he's kind of punching at this idea of who they descend from we are of Our Father Abraham and we have Abraham Our Father we descend from righteous Isaac we have Jacob we're sons of Israel and he says oh no you generate of your Generation of Vipers who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves and this just to me reinforces how he knew as soon as he called him Generation of Vipers they would have an object an objection we have Abraham to our father says don't don't even start don't even start to say oh well we come from Abraham we come from Isaac he's saying you need to repent it doesn't matter who your father was it doesn't matter who your grandfather was it doesn't matter if you can go all the way back to Abraham you need to repent for I say unto you that God is able of these Stones notice to raise up children unto Abraham that maybe whoa that escalated quickly um you don't need to get so extreme brother John that's kind of ridiculous raise up stones but he's trying to make a point you lay so much on your natural claim but God can supernaturally bring forth children of Abraham and then notice this statement should not should make more sense within context and now also the ax is laid into the root of the trees and another place that says the root of the tree so what has he done he's taken all their little family trees he's like chopping it down taking all Generation of Vipers oh no no look at my family tree chops it down another person that says oh no no what about my tree chops it down they're saying oh well at least Israel stands no I'm chopping the whole family tree down the tree represented the Jewish Nation it represented natural lineage and what was what was soon going to happen they were all going to be dispersed right the destruction of Jerusalem all the seedlings all the trees cut down and Scattered and destroyed Jerusalem destroyed the Seed of Abraham the seed of Isaac all scattered out in the despour all spread out and what was going to happen Israel as a nation was going to be chopped down to a stump but what was going to rise Christ a new family tree and so he's talking about them as trees represent even individuals being part of that tree he says Act is being laid to the root of the tree this was their the Isaiah 11 looming so large in their minds we have this genealogy that can be reckoned this makes us who we are this is this is what my identity is wrapped up in now in John chapter 3 verses 1 to 3 . I'm actually going to want to read to verse 9 but then I'm going to I'm going to enter kind of poke in here just a little bit with some other things I hope that in coming to this you can begin to see this scripture in a whole new light maybe maybe just more light just more pronounced more Vivid um there's I I said this kind of comes in my mind in terms of of what I'm meaning you know some of you may have seen some of the videos of people who are colorblind and then they put glasses on they're adults they live their whole life being colorblind and they've done well for themselves right they put a pair of glasses on them and they begin to weep they begin to cry they're moved because they realize I could always see enough to get by and be very successful and live a full life but then all of a sudden it jumps out and Technicolor it's it's it's it's different and it's and it's revolutionizing it's still seeing the same thing but they see it more vividly that could be perhaps what I'm referring to here I even know sometimes we don't realize that we need glasses then you borrow somebody else's like whoa hold on wait a minute I need to go get my eyes checked well I'm I want you to the Lord is trying to loan you some glasses today maybe so you can say all right Lord this is the eyesight I want to see I want to see these things better there's always more definition we can get so in John chapter 3 verses one to three there was a man of the Pharisees important to know he was a Pharisee named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews so he's a ruler he's a fair Mercy he would be able to be reckoned in the genealogy he's a ruler of the Jews so he would be of a certain pedigree the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him there's a reason why he did it at night because he was a Pharisee because he was a ruler and said to him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God I don't know if he's using the Royal we there or if his is truly another a group of rabbis or if they knew amongst themselves or the Pharisees themselves knew hey this isn't good for us but we know he's the real deal but it says we know that there are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him now if you if you heard that on you and someone told you say yeah Nicodemus was hanging out with Jesus last night at Dutch Brothers and uh and he paid him a really really big compliment and he said you know what you are you are definitely from God because no man could be doing these things except to be from God and and Jesus said you're welcome no he answers instead of verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God I I want you to realize that just what a what a I want to say just like a blast but something that just kind of rips the needle off the Record and it kind of maybe gets into the heart of Nicodemus because he's wrestling he's coming at night because there's a rabbi we know that you're a teacher that's come from God you're performing Miracles God has to be with you because what we're seeing uh we see you is doing things that only God could do and so Jesus's answer seems to me uh to kind of be incongruent to the compliment because Jesus doesn't say oh thank you I'm so glad I'm so glad that you've noticed and yes yes Nicodemus I am sent from God I am the Messiah I'm he who is prophesied to come to the world he takes it to a whole nother level with Nicodemus the Pharisee who can see things with his natural eye he says verily verily I send you extended thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God this is where I begin to think about those that are wanting to be baptized and those of you who don't know it yet who are going to be baptized this is where it all begins in this acknowledgment that a man must be born again and when Jesus says born again there's actually a lot of translations that render it Born Again from above because to be born again is to be born Anew and put into relationship with God as your father so it's a Heavenly birth not a natural birth he's not saying that oh you were born in Flagstaff Arizona oh well you need to go back and be born again you have to re you go through the whole process and and so to say to a Jew to be born again this begins to really pick out a sore spot because in Matthew chapter 23 verse 15 I just want to reference this hoping to come back to it later I realize I'm running out of time I have to go much faster I want to describes the Pharisees Hypocrites for the Encompass the sea land woven to you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you Compass the sea and land to make one proselyte you hear this word a lot make one proselyte and when he is made you make him twofold more than the child of Hell than yourselves I don't know why he does it but Jack goes around all the time now saying sick burn and I would say in this case yes woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you can pass sea and land to make one Prospect one convert a prostate was a gentile who converts to Judaism one who is prosely is one who has come over right they were on the wrong side now they've come over Red Rover Red Rover let the Gentile come over and he makes it over and he's now you've you've kept him and you've held him in the line and and now he has to become one of you and he says you you you can pass see in land you you're striving so hard to make a convert to your religion and all you've done is you've made them a double child of hell a twofold a double portion that means a lot to a to a Jew but he says you haven't made him more righteous you've made a more unrighteous he's a twofold more child of hell because you are hypocrites scribes and Pharisees who do everything you can to get someone to come over and he says you're just making them worse now this when Jesus is referring to a proselyte I use this scripture in particular just to identify how the Jews had a concept of being born again in relation to these converts in relation to a proselyte because a Jew believed when a gentile became a proselyte they were like a newborn child now why would they have to imagine that because they in their literal Birth by coming up and come out and crying by their natural birth they are a Jew they and they have every right and privilege under Judaism they're born naturally into this religion so when a gentile would convert they had to kind of come they had to have this idea that yes he is as if he's been born Anew because now he is going to partake in certain rights and privileges as a proselyte and so to them this birth was uh it was something we could say as Christ identifies it so I'm getting ahead of myself this birth was from below it's from the earth of natural uh water blood and life brother Brown says and who is this Melchizedek I'm just referring to it very quickly the natural birth is in three what's the first thing that happens to a woman having a baby what breaks first water what breaks next blood what's the next process Life water blood spirit takes that unique approach to these three uh agree on Earth the water blood and spirit and he actually shows how there's a connection and a type to the Natural birth and that and so to a Jew when they prosely someone they think about their process of becoming a Jew which happened by being born literally so then when one converted there's this idea that they've been as a newborn child they've entered into our religion in Ezekiel chapter 16 verses three to four as I was studying this last week I was I thought man this is such an interesting scripture and so and it just in coming across it it just was very very inspiring to me and say thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem Jerusalem this is Zion this is this Most Holy City thy birth and thy Nativity is of the land of Canaan so now it's it's bringing it lower thy father was an Amorite thy mother a hittite oh these are fighting words and as for thy Nativity thy origin thy birthplace your beginning in the day that I was born thy navel was not cut what does that mean you don't cut the navel you don't tie it up this is certain death neither was thou washed in water to Supple the Supple there means to cleanse and that was not salted at all nor swaddled at all all these different things talk about the Nativity the thy birth and Nativity thy birthplace is is Canaan your origin is an Amorite and a hittite that Nativity the day you're born your navel was not properly cut you were not washed in water to be cleansed you were not salted which they said would cause the skin to firm up and you were not swaddled which would be necessary for the appropriate coming together of tendons and bones and and then the swaddling the proper growth of the child so there's a lot that's being imagined in this statement but I just want you to realize the language of God to Jerusalem and the things that a Jew would do to a baby when they were born and so there was even I don't want to get lost in this but even in the law there was the ritual of purification by immersion in water that there you see it in several different places the priests and different ones who were unclean they would immerse themselves in water if they were defiled if you were defiled according to the law there were certain rituals of purification that you would Undertake and there would be a bath where you'd be immersed in it and it would be being you'd you'd be defiled you would bathe yourself and be immersed and you'd be considered Changed by virtue of going into that water and think about some of the things that the law would say you you um would defiled you you're just kind of talking to your buddy and you're kind of yeah you know it's been a really long day you're like you got your hand on a Sepulcher there buddy you're like oh excuse me didn't notice that I've been defiled and you say well where's the defy I mean it was how is he defiled well then in order for him and I'm not sure if it actually is in relation to touching something but there's things with bed sheets and other things that you'd be considered unclean and defiled and you'd have to go in in the mythka and you'd have to be washed and immersed through a ritual purification and they would consider you defiled before you went in the water undefiled and you came out Changed by the water and so it were restored you'd actually be restored to back to certain Privileges and rights you could return to office you could return to this you could do that and so I'm mentioning that because when Jesus as Jesus is going to go forward in John chapter 3 Nicodemus is a Pharisee and he says in Matthew chapter 23 the Pharisees they make one proselyte and in making a proselyte they they they they make one to be born Anew and they had these images in the natural I'm still I'm still in Ezekiel 16. they have this uh this position in the natural Nativity and birth and all these different elements so a Jew by their natural birth a Jew by their natural birth identified themselves with the promise I bet my court has been cut I've been swaddled I've been salted I've been I've been suppled my Nativity is in Jerusalem and there would be no need for a Jew to be born again right no need at all for a Jew to be born again so in John chapter 3 verse 4 Nicodemus saith unto him or you understand his position and why he's objecting how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born now if Nicodemus had perhaps heard Jesus say this to a gentile maybe he rationalizes it and he's like that's right that's right he needs to be changed he needs to convert to Judaism he needs to accept our principles and our laws but he is saying this to a Jew and a Jew could not conceive the need to be born anew because their identity was so rigidly fashioned and natural Linus to Natural pedigree their first birth was all it took that's what made them who they were and that's what they were so concerned with so his objectives how can a man be born again when he is old can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born and maybe to Nicodemus he's thinking into my I need to go back and be born by the same father and mother again that's ridiculous the I'm going to be the same one that I was when I came forth because I'm a Jew I'm a Jew of Jews I'm a Pharisee what's the need what's the point of being born again and Jesus hits it in verse 5 verily verily I send it except the man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh I kind of Taken Nicodemus saying you're thinking of the flesh I'm talking about the spirit that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again notice the emphasis when Jesus said except a man be born again in other words he said ye must be born again so he says Marvel not when I said except a man be born again in other words I said you must be born again and that's exactly how Nicodemus took it because he was coming wait a minute why do I need to be born again and so he says it again the wind bloweth where it listeth thou heard here is the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh and wither it goeth now to a Jew they could say I know where I'm standing right now Nicodemus so many years old and I can tell you who my father was who his father was I could tell you all the way back my point of origin I go back to Abraham and he's saying when the one that is when the wind blows you're not gonna be able to go back and find it in the temple archives so is everyone that is born of the spirit so this is this is a real large picture right that he's talking about there's there's a deep subject that he's dealing with with Nicodemus Nicodemus answered and said to him how can these things be that's an understatement right he is he is just his his head is exploding he has just been gut punched he is being told and reinforced that no Nicodemus you can trace who you are all the way back to Abraham it means nothing you need to be born again and you need to be born again by something you cannot see you cannot look up in a temple archive you need to be born again from above Christ is revealing the new birth from above the new rebirth by the Holy Spirit he's being said he's saying yeah you got a great first birth but there must be a second birth there must be a second birth that's why when we talked about the sycamore tree that salvation must be preached salvation must be made available if there's not salvation offered and we are not saved by that baptism of the Holy Ghost we are just a gathering of people today just to gather and we'd be better off trying to find someplace that's got a big enough dining hall and a better a good enough brunch and can give a group discount and not add the gratuity on at 18 since we're over a party of eight and we'd be do there's a lot of other things we could be doing in a lot cooler places I would even venture to say that if it wasn't for the second birth we'd be living wherever we wanted to live doing whatever we wanted to do and it probably wouldn't be Phoenix there's something about that second birth that changes everything Jesus is saying by your first birth as he talks about that which is of the flesh his flesh is flesh it's by our first birth that we understand and live within the natural world I mean that sounds so duh right the only reason why you can live as you were born the only way you understand the natural word is because you were born into it that's the birth of the natural man and he's wanting to bring us parallel to be born of of Heaven brings forth New Life to where you can begin to live and understand the kingdom of God we've been born into the kingdom of this world and the in the different kingdoms of animal life and plant life and all the different Arrangements of life and that's what we're born in we're born into this world but now he's saying you can be born again and be born from above you can begin to live in God's kingdom and see or understand God's Kingdom he continues to amplify what it means to be born again if you continue to read in John chapter 3 or just making quick reference that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life that's whosoever believeth shall be born again have eternal life we've touched on this I think it's a whole separate subject and I need to hurry up so I'm just going to reference it very quickly to be part of the tree of life you have to be born again we know that in the book there's two records there's one book two records a book of life which records all the wheat plant but then the record of eternal life or the Lamb's Book of Life and that's the germ the seed and so there can even even look at it how there's a record of all all Humanity that grows up that eventually just become dead dry stock and those names can be removed right but then there's a record of how the life even in your life you were just a wheat plant but by virtue of predestination you were a gene seed of God and so your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life and can never be removed and so there's even an image of a family tree in the image of the books and those that are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life and then those are recorded in the record of life and if your name is removed from the record of life when you stand before white Throne you have no inheritance in the Eternal but those whose names is in the lamb book Lamb's Book life are doing the judging of the wheat plant you know in First Corinthians chapter 12 verses 12 to 14 Paul is saying how the body of Christ has many members but one body just as a tree has many branches but it's one tree it says for by one Spirit verse 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been made all to drink into one Spirit no matter what branch you are on the tree you have the same root system that's drawn from the same Life Source just as the lamps depicted in the church ages draw from the same Source not only are the age of Messengers representing the lamb but every believer is represented a lamp of drawing from the same Life Source you are part of this body different members but one body neither Jew nor Gentile of this Branch or that lineage or that DNA but you're all baptized by one Spirit what are you born into the family of God by the new birth brother Branham says in the chapter 4 the church age book now to receive Christ is to receive his spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive a spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost can you do the math a equals b equals C C equals a a equals B they're all the same thing to be born against to receive a spirit to be born again is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost they are one in the same could read in other places where he says this so now everybody all right everybody good you good you're my litmus test today when you start fading then that's when I'm gonna start wrapping up not trying to encourage you to be a drama uh major or anything right now but everyone hope everyone's staying with me it's a little hotter up here because we're on the south campus side where there's no AC working now in Acts chapter 2 verses 36 to 41 this is this is where I hope that what's happening is it's becoming more Vivid the language of the scripture the birth of the church what Jesus said to Nicodemus the sermon that Peter preaches on the day of Pentecost therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly the lineage the genealogy the house the fam of Israel Noah surely that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in the heart and sending to Peter into the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do this is a response from those of the house in the lineage of David the house of Israel he says and then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so to receive his Spirit as a gift to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost so you repent you believe you repent you to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because your sins have been remitted and then you are Born Again by The Gift of the Holy Ghost this is the prescription this is the answer oh we're on the house of Israel we have get crucified an innocent man what should we do well you remember when John was saying the ax is laid to the root of the tree and you needed to repent and he was baptizing by immersion symbolizing that which was to come and looking forward to this now I'm telling you that what Jesus taught in John 3 what John was symbolizing on the Jordan River this is what you must now do you must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you need to be born again and then that's why even the language he uses next for the promises unto you you need to be born again and your children need to be born again because just because you get born again they're not any more converted this is something revolutionary you reckon your genealogy back to Abraham you were of the House of Israel but I'm telling you that you need to be born again and once you've converted and what you've been changed and once you've done it even your children need to do it because now we're using a complete different record than the one you're used to and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call gives new meaning to these names that are added and these names that are being called and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation and verse 41 then they that gladly received his word this is how it works they that gladly received his word were baptized sometimes you wonder when people receive the word and they're not baptized maybe they weren't gladly receiving it and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 Souls you're not talking about shoes the same day were added unto them about 3 000 Souls not added to a natural Church not reckoned to a different genealogy or natural record not added to the house of Israel the house of Israel no what must we do you need to be changed you need to be born again you don't need to have proselytes to your to the house of Israel you need to be changed completely in verse 47 it says praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved now I'm transitioning a little bit I know it's getting hot it's getting lengthy here I want you to just we're we're waiting for the water to warm up for those who are being baptized they this is very important for us to catch now because I'm transitioning to a birthplace our family tree what did it speak of even this church this church serves the true church so remember those images we've tried to bring to you praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved those that were saved or added to the church but which church was growing ask yourself which church was growing it wasn't just the local Gathering because as we looked at how they all gathered from all these different places from Egypt and philistia and phenicia and Ethiopia and all these different places they'd gathered for the Passover and they were there they were there for the Feast of Pentecost they were there during that time and then what was going to they were going to hear the word they were going to be saved and it didn't mean they had to stay there they were going back to where they came from and so it wasn't just the church that was growing locally but it was the true church the souls were being added to the true church how because they were repenting being baptized and being born again by one Spirit they were being baptized into the body of Christ and they had become a member of the family I'm sure that you know this well to be a part of the local church no birth is required to be added to the uh the membership directory if you didn't get the email that's what we're alluding to you might need to be added to the directory and and all you have to do is you just to be a member of a church even according to the message to be a voting member you support it with ties and your attendance and anybody who has money to give and a body to bring to church can become a member of a church and and but the true church is the pedigree of Christ it requires a New Birth by God's spirit where you become members but there's no membership because there's when I look at my hand I mean if my thumb could talk it's not going to ask the pinky where's your membership card right it's a member but there's no membership because it's still one body and so a local church can offer membership to anyone and provide an opportunity for membership but remember the goal of the local church is not membership the goal of the local church is to be a birthplace for the seed of God Esther the local church is interested in births brother Madam in the message the way of a true Prophet I've chose these two just to kind of get our minds uh you know kind of looking around in virtual reality inside our heads trying to figure out how this all fits there's nobody can join the church you join a lodge you don't join a church the capital c is used here you're born in a church and he's going to clarify the church you're born in a church you joined the Methodist Lodge the Baptist Lodge the Catholic Lodge the Pentecostal Lodge what would we call ours but you're born into the Church of the Living God and that's what he's coming after the church so we have lodges not churches anything can gather in that Lodge Hypocrites and everything else I know this I know this is tricky the vernacular he's using but Ponder this anything can gather in that Lodge Hypocrites and everything else but I'll let you know this right now according to the word there's not one hypocrite in the Church of the Living God there's nothing there but Saints you think there's three kinds of Believers in the true church no in the true church there's only one one believer Saints there's not even three kinds of Believers you're a Believer you're an Uber believer and you're the uberous believer no you're all believers not one hypocrite in the Church of the Living God then in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel there's no such a thing as Pentecostal Church there's no such thing as Baptist Church it's Baptist Lodge Pentecostal Lodge Presbyterian Lodge but there's only one Church and there's only one way you can get into it and that's by birth you realize what we ought to be interested in as a church as Leaders of our families as members of this church what we ought to be interested in is not growing membership but making sure that this is what people are coming to is this church listen Phoenix didn't need another Lodge all right we didn't come here to be in the hospitality industry in the line of Hiltons and Marriotts no the goal is to see the seed of God find their place there's only one thing you can get only one way you can get into it and that's by birth you're born into the Church of Jesus Christ and a member of his body the spiritual delegation of heaven then the signs that Christ is with you lives through you Christians oh you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a Son of God you must become relation to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son and only his sons and daughters are saved only those who listen this is very very important to understand only those who have the baptismal Holy Ghost truly possess eternal life the Holy Ghost is eternal life only those who've truly been born again by being baptized with the Holy Ghost are Sons and Daughters of God otherwise you have sons and daughters of God being left in Tribulation and standing before white Throne judgment but only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of a church but Sons and Daughters there's only one thing that'll produce that that's the new birth that the new birth is the only thing that will produce relationship to God Preston being baptized today doesn't make you a member of this church you're that already but to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you're seeking a birth a new birth Jesus answered and Senator Nicodemus verily verily I send to thee except a man be born again the way Jesus puts it and the next moment is you must be born again or you'll never be able to understand the kingdom of God think about that unless you're born again you'll never be able to understand the kingdom of God you can you can observe all sorts of things as it relates to the move of God and the manifestation of the spirit within churches but you'll never understand the kingdom of God brother banham said in a message Paradox for instance I believe that every born-again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves I believe each of you methodists and Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine New Birth and has now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost genuine New Birth is tied to the baptismal ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle right now notice this next statement glad it's on its own slide unless that happens you're there you cannot be a Christian that's not that we'd be waving at and anybody anybody's face who professes to be a Christian but this is our understanding maybe you could bring it up to somebody who says they're a Christian say oh you've been born again Because unless that happens a genuine New Birth which is to receive the baptismally ghost unless that happens you cannot be a Christian then in order to be a Christian Church it has to be a gathering of Christians and it has to be producing Christians it's not about running out and finding somebody who is Islam or somebody who's in some other religion and just getting them to profess Christ and be born again by a new profession and joining a church now they've just changed membership we make them proselytes and they're a twofold child of hell because now they've just changed membership from one ideology to another ideology and they've never been changed but now they have the reinforcement of all this perceived Vindication and all the righteousness that surrounds them and they feel safe and knowing I believe God sent a prophet brother God thought it brother man has spoken I believe it that settles it and that makes me that's the proof that I have the Holy Ghost no no no no wait a minute there is a definite experience of the Holy Ghost that every single message believer must have it doesn't matter how well you know it it doesn't mean if your pedigree goes all the way back to day one of the Branham Tabernacle ye must be born again good he says in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals Center friend or lukewarm church member do you just have a membership in a church or do you have a membership not have a membership I remember he's saying that he he didn't he said these same things and at the Branham Tabernacle he scolded them at Branham Tabernacle and if you have only a membership you'd be pretty near as well off without it you need a birth and the breach brother Branham we're about now this is the breach between the seven churches and the Seven Seals shouldn't we be talking about something a little bit more heady at this point you need a birth you must come to the blood you must come to something that just spots the sin away to there's no more remembrance of it if you haven't made preparation yet to meet the lamb in the air and by the power this is so beautiful and by the power invested invested me by my commission given by almighty God and minister to me by an Angel a pillar of light I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ don't try to meet him with only a membership of a lodge a church of this Earth listen the only thing that makes the difference from a lodge and a real church is the fact that there's born ones in there that there's those that have been born again that's what makes it different than just any other gathering without Christians it is just a lodge without being a birthplace without those who've been born by the spirit of God it becomes just a lodge don't try to make them think about this this is March 17th in the evening 1963 he knows he's going to be preaching the first seal on the end of the urgency hears he says now as we still have time before the lamb takes the book as he uses that language he's saying by the power invested me by my commission given by almighty God and ministered to be by an Angel a pillar of light whoo I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ at the doorstep of the seals don't try to meet him with only a membership of a lodge the Church of this Earth make preparation by being born again question and answers on Hebrews part three he says 1957 so therefore friends membership of a church or knowledge of some theology or something that could be message theology I know we hear a lot of preachers talking about message theologians can't wait till they come out with the directory of who these message theologians are because it always seems like they're kind of hinting at some people we should be watching but there's membership of a church or knowledge of some theology or something don't have one thing to do with it it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ in a new birth that joins you to him as one person it's what it's got to be not membership at a church you can change church is all you want won't change you a bit unless she finally changed the one that's interested in changing you it's got to be the blood of Jesus Christ and a new birth that joins you to him as one person Jeremiah chapter 17 verses 5 to 8. I know we're just about into the after hour just stay with me Jeremiah chapter 17 verses 5 to 8 thus saith the Lord curse be the man that trusteth in man and maketh this maketh flesh his arm flesh is protector flesh is supporter his Defender his provider and whose heart departeth from the Lord and I want you to catch this image now kind of maybe seeding some things for the future now for he be like the heath in the desert you know some say that it'd be like a Tamarisk in the desert it's individual the heath in the desert naked stripped it's a naked stripped destitute tree that's what this Heath in the desert is I hope nobody's naming their son Heath yeah no I have no problem with Heath I just came in my mind be like the heath and the desert stripped and destitute tree and shall not see when good cometh it can't partake of good it's a tree in the desert and even if it rains they can't receive it even if even when the word is preached it's as if it's far from them because they're just strip destitute in the desert they can't get any benefits they can't partake in good but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness dry parched in a salt land and not inhabited now I'm gonna have to condense this very quickly but this is applicable to churches this describes churches because talks in several places they become dry and carnal I trust you just I hope you're all messes theologians this morning so you know what I'm referring to when I talk about the church being dry brother Brown described the stock the wheat plant as being what dried up the churches seven Church ages all these churches dried up no life in them there's no cannot bring forth Sons and Daughters of God they're sterile they're dry they're all dried up they become dry car this is applicable to churches but then it's also applicable to members brother Brown talks about them in dry sticky they fuss and stew even in the church age book he uses this scripture Luke chapter 23 verse 31 for if they do these things in a green tree which shall be done in the dry the Jews compared a good man to a green tree and he's saying if they will kill an innocent man what the way they do to a bad man so they had a the Jews had a tradition that a good man is a green tree a bad man is a dead one and brother around him in the church age book uses this very script should refer to churches there can be green trees there can be dry trees there can be trees that are living there could be trees that are dead and so there's a cursed man who trusts in himself and he makes the flesh his protector his arm his Defender but now verse 7 blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters and that spreadeth out her Roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh just as the other one cannot see when good cometh in other words it can't get rain it can't benefit from rain it it's all dried up it's not receiving rain but now it's saying it's not gonna have to worry about when heat cometh because her Leaf shall be green blessed is the man who trusteth in the Lord he shall be as a tree that spreadeth out her Roots by the river shall not see when he cometh and her leaves shall be green do you see the image of a church and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit isn't that a beautiful description now I have to come to this this is my my closing emphasis and I've actually written some of these things down just so I can be very deliberate in what I'm saying in Jeremiah chapter 17 as you have a cursed tree and then you have a blessed a cursed man and a blessed man cursed Tree on a blessed tree if the dry staleness starchy but then you have this other one that it's planted by Waters it spread out her roots heat's not going to destroy her Leaf is always Green in the year of drought she's not worried her fruit's never going to cease connecting this back to what Jesus said about a proselyte if you're only a church member I want you to think about if you only are a church member you can become a proselyte of any church right that's all you are is a church member then you can come over right to another church and be a prosely if you are just a church member you can proselytize someone to become a member right because if you're just a church member you're just like Nicodemus you think that a gentile's the only one that can come over and be born Anew and that happens by subscribing to a new ideology a new way of saying things come over trust in this arm why don't you come if you are only a church member all you really do is proselytize someone else to become a member and let me say this if all we have are church members then we'll be afraid that someone else could proselytize them right that's all we have that all we have is church members then we should we're always afraid that someone will proselytize the members of the church but I'm saying this to to this not to defend not even as commentary on churches but a church is interested in a birth so in a church a church a church and a church that's interested in birth makes no claims on Sons and Daughters of God if that's what a church is interested in then their their goal is to see that Sons and Daughters of God are baptized by one Spirit into the family of God and that they know that the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and they don't claim any ownership over the children of God if we have members we could say we own you all day long your name on the directory well if you don't do this we'll just take your name right out of the directory that's one reason why I don't like directories is they're adding and removing it's kind of like well let me just print out a phone book believing they'll all be in there eventually right there's every just print out zip codes and area code directories and claim them for the glory of God no we won't do that don't have enough toner but if you're a member ow so a church is interested in birth and then the church then is not making claims on on they don't make claims on the sons or don't have a god and listen if you're a son or daughter of God if you're a member of the body of Christ you're not the property of any church you are a fruitful tree planted by the rivers of water that attracts those that are in parched places so that's a mouthful well I got it from the message let me read it to you how I let me read to you in a few quotes here as we continue on where this struck out struck out to me brother Bram says in the evening messenger that's the mat what's the matter today is membership yes members Big membership big Sunday School classes pay prizes for somebody that can press the light and bring somebody else from some other church over big prizes bring a friend they might get an iPad next Sunday pay prizes for somebody that can process like and bring somebody else from some of the church over see who had the most you know that's phariseeism and then make a big brag about it we beat them last Sunday if you've got to a place could you imagine if we we kind of always messaged churches we had to kind of submit our roles right how many did you have in church Sunday morning brother well we only had you know so many like huh you're falling way far in these fantasy church rankings buddy you should probably propose a couple trains there pal you're not gonna win the League this year he says if you've got to a place where you have to make the Church of God a rat race then it's time to close the doors and go home there's a reason to count the Sheep when it comes to a trustee when it comes a deacon there's a reason why you want to know how many parking spaces do we have how many chairs do we need to put out it's good to know who's coming into the Sunday school class who's coming into into the uh into the youth group and those things there's a reason to count there's a reason to begin to identify and number certain things there's a right way to do it but if that's the goal is to see that the we're inching up in membership time to close the doors and go home Church of God listen the Church of God is a living article of God on Earth manifest in Jesus Christ that's what the Church of God is and so therefore a church ought to be a gathering of living articles I've got a living articles to attract those you're a living article therefore here you are you're at a green tree you're a fruitful tree you're drawing from a well Source people should see your branches they should see your fruit and say where did you get green like that where did you get fruit like that where do you get joy like that well how can you live like that I'm planted by a river of water I've dug down deep and I found a source that makes me the way that I am and all those dead dry parched trees say lead me to that Oasis lead me to that Branch I want to find a place in it listen the idea of the Grove when Abraham planted it was to satisfy those who are traveling in dry places those that were parched and dry and weary and traveling coming through the desert heat they'd find a place out on the horizon they'd see not a mirage but an actual Oasis in Abraham waiting and you see somebody coming he said oh Sarah here's our chance to declare the name of God and it's not as they pass by Jesus right that's what people I used to have some acquaintances back in the day and I was preaching to the church and these guys were driving me I can't remember what point in the whole weekend it was but they did drive by praisings I guess they used to be gangsters and they would drive by and they'd say hallelujah and they scare people and yell out drive by praisings and that's not what Abraham was doing Abraham wasn't Karma hey God spoke to me I'm the real deal my seed are going to be like the Sands of the earth and the stars of Heaven he would invite them in wash their feet minister to them nourish them and begin to declare the name of God and then when they would ask and in quash say thank you Abraham he said oh no no no no I didn't do this Elohim Jehovah who's this Jehovah you speak of he's the one true God how can I serve him would you like to make a sacrifice to him here that's what the Grove represented listen we don't want we don't want uh we don't want members we want born ones LED ones those that are LED what I desire is that there be born ones I would desire that born ones gather and those unborn when they gather be born who find that their worth is not wrapped up in a church image that it's not who they are as Jeremiah said that trust in man and makes man makes flesh his arm his protector his Defender our worth is not tied up in our church image that we have to improve upon the church image in order to improve on who we are you are who you are by the grace of God and by election and no Lodge will ever change that brother Brandon I just I want you to catch this image when I say you are you are a tree I said that's an attraction and God identified himself by his characteristics all our things in Arizona are trees are full of stickers everything has a sticker it's because it's dry now that same Bush growed over here it'd be a nice lovely leaf see it's without water and that's the reason it becomes a sticker remember Jeremiah says in Jeremiah 17 the heath in the desert sorry Heath that when they can't see in good cometh they inhabit Parts dried places the salt land not inhabited it's just a miserable existence brother batam is saying it's without water that's the reason it becomes a sticker and when the church becomes without the Water of Life it gets dry and sticky too sticking and punching and everything right when the water of life is not flowing that's when we just start punching at other people right Heath just over there sucker punching every message Theologian why because there's no River of Life flowing and he says it opens When the Water of Life flows it opens up the leaf and makes it tender mellow it's sweet holy and acceptable unto God listen listen to this so may the Lord God water us tonight that we won't be stickers listen I'm not talking about Arizona Believers Church I'm talking about the Believers the only way this church can ever keep from getting sticky the only way this church can ever keep from being a heathen just punches is when you when you become a fruitful bowel when you become one that won't be a sticker but will be fine leaves oh the only way this tree can be inviting is when you become fine leaves that the Wayward people might sit down under the tree of our shade and find rest to their souls people might sit under this the tree of our shade this tree our leaves Ah that's what it is our leaves you you say oh it's hot in here why don't you shade somebody hey seriously I'm not literally don't hover over brother loyal right now but you're the leaves your life your nature your character listen we know it there's there's different ways brother man talks about people in a church cast a shadow of over other people they cast a shadow over the service they come resenting and the Holy Spirit won't reveal they come with unconfessed sin and that causes the church to bitterly fail what's happening it's a dried up sticky uh leaf that doesn't want to change and it casts to Paul over the church and so what we need to be is be sure that we're a green leaf now our roots are down deep so that we can find that one that's sticky and cover them come over them and let them see that there is a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost there is a River of Life what he says it shall flow out of you rivers of Living Water shall flow out of you oh may God water us that we won't be stickers but we'll be fine leaves the Wayward people would sit under the shade of our tree and find rest to their souls oh God has anybody noticed something about this service yet I haven't got to my text so here we go let's close on this Psalms 87. the psalmer song for the sons of Korah some people don't like it but it's in the Bible his foundation is in the Holy mountains the Lord let me read let me read you some other translations of this he founded Zion on the Holy Mountain and oh God and oh how God loves his home his foundation is in the Holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion the city of his foundation is on the Holy Mountain the lord loves the gates of Zion how he loves his home he loves the city of Jerusalem it was founded by the Lord talking about a city the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob why because there's one spiritual all these natural right glorious things are spoken of Thee spoken of you o city of God 's Hometown everyone there is talking about you oh city of God what glorious things are said of you listen they're Gathering and they're not talking about all their natural dwellings they're not talking about all the dwellings of Jacob they're not talking about all the dwellings of Israel they're talking about what God has done they're talking about the city he's founded they're talking about Jerusalem and as they would see that as a holy city we know he's talking about a spiritual Zion say law it says I verse 4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me behold philistia and Tyree with Ethiopia this man was born there I'm just going to keep reading and come back to and of Zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her listen to what it's saying and the highest himself shall establish her blessed is the man whose hope is in the Lord whose trust is in the Lord and not flesh as his arm and not trusted in man not in his dwellings of Jacob not in the natural tree but the one that God has established the Lord shall count when he rideth up the people when he does his family tree when he reckons their genealogy that this man was born there that say law is an interlude and it says as well the singers as the players on the instrument shall be there all my Springs are in thee listen what it means the source of my life brings from you all those that dwell in tents of Jacob and Tabernacles of Jacob and all those in the dwellings of Israel could all reckon themselves back to Israel but now there's a different pronouncement all my life the source of my life Springs from Zion my birthplace Zion is my birthplace wait I thought you were born in Nazareth I thought you were born in Bethlehem I thought you were born in philisto I thought you're no no no no no no my life Zion is my birthplace did I ever tell you about my story when I met the owner of Texas the steak steak house in Phoenix it's just it's all Texas stuff right so you know it's the best ever and uh and so it's all Texas stuff and I lived there for long enough I can I can poke at him a little bit I got children born there so my argument to this guy was he goes oh you were born in Texas we were just hitting it off about Texas right all this Texas bravado and then come to find and says well where were you born Flagstaff and he looked at me like I was some kind of interloper I think he's about to kick me out of the church and I said but I was born again in Texas and he said I'll accept that I I don't know what it did for me I didn't get a discount or nothing but there's a there's a new birth that no matter what your dwelling in Jacob was is all these are bragging Zion is my birthplace I know verse 4 may seem to be a little bit interesting I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me behold philistia and Tyree with Ethiopia it says Egypt Babylonia philistia phenicia in Ethiopia are some of those Nations that know you think of all these nations so it's Ray habit it's not Rahab the Harlot but it speaks of Egypt Babylon Philistine phenicia Ethiopia it's naming all these surrounding regions he says these other nations these other people they're not born in Palestine they don't dwell in the dwellings of Jacob but this is what they're going to say I was born in Zion there's no privilege being born in Egypt there's no privilege being born in phenicia there was no privilege being born in Ethiopia there are all these other places oh you were born there oh what was it there was a it was a disc to say oh this man could anything good thing come out of Nazareth like there were certain stigmas attached to certain areas there was no privilege I think men can build cities in boast of them men can build churches and brag about them but Zion Zion is the birthplace of God's children Zion is the tree that we point to notice verses six five and six and we're closing I'm closing with this scripture end of Zion it shall be said this and that this man this woman from here and there this and that man this and that all these all these places were born in her and the highest think what I said in Zion it shall be said this man was born in her that man was born in her that woman was born in her that girl was born in her this man this woman that one you say they were born where in Zion wait I happen to know Batman was born in Prescott I happen to know that one was born in Minneapolis I happen to know this one was born there no no no no that man that woman was born again in Zion this sister this brother this young man this young lady was born again in Zion the Lord shall count the Lord shall count when he writes up his people that this man was born there listen as a church it is not our goal to count members we want to count the born ones when we when we do a register when we count our interest is in the born ones that this one was born again here men and women were born again not just born in this church listen I got to come back not a retraction but let me just add when you have a baby in this church we'll add their name to the directory all right all right we're adding names of the director the directory's getting longer right certain families are certainly helping that out right we got more that that entry is getting bigger but listen Jesus would look at you and say wow that's quite that's quite an entry and the Arizona Believers Church directory fantastic that's wonderful you must be born again every time we add a name to church directory by natural birth it's one more it's one more person we need to see a second birth for like well this is the church just got more the commission just expanded for all of these young young babies that we have in the church all these ones being born you know what tells us we've got we got more work to do why because that wasn't enough as long as we're here our interests see that that little one comes to know Christ count the ones born there count the ones that become citizens of Zion their birthplace and I say then let this church become a birthplace not to be born in this church to be born again in Zion and let it be a gathering of born ones let's stand
