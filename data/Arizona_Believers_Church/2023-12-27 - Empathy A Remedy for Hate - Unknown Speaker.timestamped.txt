[0:00] Luke chapter 10 verse 25 and behold a
[0:03] certain lawyer uhhuh of course a certain
[0:07] lawyer stood up and tempted him saying
[0:09] Master what shall I do to inherit
[0:12] eternal life there's a lot of context to
[0:14] this that would be helpful but we just
[0:15] feel to zero in on one particular aspect
[0:18] in Jesus it says he said unto him what
[0:20] is written in the law how readest thou
[0:23] and he answering said Thou shalt love
[0:25] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[0:26] with all thy soul and with all thy
[0:28] strength and with all thy mind and thy
[0:30] neighbor as thyself and he said unto him
[0:33] thou Hast answered right this do and
[0:36] thou shalt
[0:37] live but he willing to justify himself
[0:40] said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor
[0:43] and Jesus answering said it's remarkable
[0:47] that he's not just answering it directly
[0:50] and but he's he is is answering it in a
[0:53] very profound way a certain man went
[0:55] down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell
[0:58] among Thieves which stripped him of his
[1:00] reignment and wounded him and departed
[1:01] leaving him half dead and by chance
[1:04] there came down a certain priest that
[1:06] way and when he saw him he passed by on
[1:08] the other side and likewise a levite
[1:11] when he was at the place came and looked
[1:13] on him and passed by on the other side
[1:17] but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed
[1:19] came where he was and when he saw him he
[1:22] had compassion on him and went to him
[1:25] and bound up his wounds pouring in oil
[1:28] and wine and set him on his own be and
[1:30] brought him to an end and took care of
[1:32] him on the tomorrow when he departed he
[1:34] took out two pence and gave them to the
[1:36] host and said unto him take care of him
[1:38] whatsoever thou spendest more when I
[1:40] come again I will repay thee now Jesus
[1:43] asked the lawyer again which now of
[1:45] these three thinkest thou was neighbored
[1:49] unto him that fell among the thieves and
[1:52] he said he that showed Mercy on him then
[1:55] said Jesus unto him go and do thou
[1:58] likewise amen you can be
[2:04] seated my my title tonight is empathy a
[2:08] remedy for hate and as we uh covered
[2:11] hate through a few services and a series
[2:13] on hatred uh we just we want didn't want
[2:15] to leave that subject just yet as a
[2:17] matter of fact uh some of the things
[2:18] that brother Timothy ashong was me
[2:20] mentioning on Sunday kind of just nudged
[2:22] me further into this I had been um just
[2:25] working on some thoughts on kind of my
[2:27] working title was thoughts on overcoming
[2:30] hatred and was looking at the themes of
[2:33] compassion and EMP empathy and how those
[2:35] things all relate and then brother
[2:37] Timothy uh mentioned some things and
[2:39] even used some quotes and uh talked
[2:41] about some things I'd like to just take
[2:43] right from there are a few things that
[2:45] he quoted from and just use them again
[2:46] tonight and explore this subject of
[2:49] empathy and call it a remedy for hate
[2:52] and so it's kind of thoughts on
[2:53] overcoming hate and hopefully this will
[2:56] not we're not going to dwell so much on
[2:58] the hatred but even how that we can
[3:00] recognize the precursors of hate and how
[3:03] that there's certain seeds uh that if
[3:05] they take root it becomes a root of
[3:07] bitterness certain things that can start
[3:09] out as an emotion a very strong reaction
[3:12] to something and if we don't uh address
[3:14] that wrath or that anger or the offense
[3:16] if we don't give it some context and let
[3:18] the Holy Spirit deal with it and have
[3:20] the right attitude towards it that's
[3:22] what can breed hatred hatred and lead us
[3:24] to some more intense emotions and we
[3:27] want to uh remember as we're using this
[3:30] a remedy for hate that hate is a poison
[3:33] and so there's some antidote there's
[3:35] something that we need to counteract
[3:37] hatred that when it begins to try to
[3:39] draw near to us and work in our minds
[3:40] and in our hearts and so hopefully this
[3:42] subject of empathy and kind of the
[3:44] things we explore around it will help us
[3:46] to understand how that we can address
[3:49] and deal with these feelings these
[3:51] strong feelings that either are
[3:52] projected towards us that we're trying
[3:54] to be provoked into or if we're
[3:56] experiencing them ourselves the best way
[3:58] to overcome it and if I could put it
[4:00] this way and I want to point out this is
[4:02] one of my favorite paintings this is by
[4:04] Vincent van Gogh and it is uh him
[4:07] copying uh de la croy's Good Samaritan
[4:10] painting he kind of does it in his own
[4:11] style it's a very beautiful painting but
[4:13] that's what's depicted here as hiso is
[4:16] uh you know the this re uh image of this
[4:20] Good Samaritan lifting this man who fell
[4:22] victim to thieves upon his own burden
[4:24] and you could see even his his
[4:25] possessions are emptied out of the
[4:27] suitcase you even see maybe the Levi
[4:29] just passing around the corner in the
[4:31] foreground so it's real beautiful
[4:32] painting and uh and just wanted to
[4:35] present this image to the Good Samaritan
[4:37] so we come to in a moment but if I could
[4:39] use this hate can be overcome by
[4:42] perspective and you think wow that's you
[4:44] that's quite a statement but if I could
[4:45] say when we see things differently than
[4:47] before it could change the way we feel
[4:50] about someone or something our initial
[4:52] glance at something might cause some
[4:54] sort of horror we might be repulsed by
[4:56] it but once you understand better the
[4:58] context or you understand more to the
[5:01] situation uh you realize oh okay that
[5:04] that makes sense I mean if I told you
[5:06] that I know of a message Minister who's
[5:07] married dozens of women you might think
[5:09] well that's horrible but I'm just
[5:10] referring to him officiating wedding
[5:12] ceremonies you oh well just you put it
[5:15] that way it makes more sense and so
[5:17] there's things sometimes that just give
[5:18] some color to things we hear that
[5:20] changes the way we feel about something
[5:23] and referring to I can't remember now
[5:26] just exactly I think it was on the last
[5:27] time we ministered on a Sunday we were
[5:29] looking at how that people often hate
[5:31] because they fear something the thing
[5:33] that we fear the thing that we don't
[5:35] know the thing that we understand we can
[5:36] hate it just because it's different from
[5:38] us it's called the fear of the unknown
[5:40] and because there's fear it leads to
[5:41] hatred uh something that you don't
[5:44] understand it can lead you to hate uh
[5:46] things that you're not willing to accept
[5:47] it can lead you to hate it and sometimes
[5:49] we do that just to un justify our lack
[5:51] of understanding or to keep us in that
[5:54] laziness of not trying to understand and
[5:57] we saw in the scripture where Paul is
[5:59] telling us that we should work to
[6:00] cultivate an understanding of others so
[6:03] that we could guard against that kind of
[6:05] hate that kind of disdain and judgment
[6:07] that comes from ignorance even we're
[6:09] looking at that statement that fear is
[6:11] bred by the fear of the unknown or fear
[6:13] of anything that's different than you
[6:15] our fear of things that are outside of
[6:17] what you consider to be normal and and
[6:20] this is I think it's really good for us
[6:22] to challenge ourselves because let's
[6:23] just admit it we're different and as
[6:26] message Believers I would say this even
[6:27] if you're just raised in the message and
[6:29] and you just do everything that the
[6:31] messages taught you and even haven't
[6:32] been born again we could just be
[6:34] different by discipline different by
[6:36] theology but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[6:38] is distinctly different than everyone
[6:40] else and if we're not careful our
[6:43] differences in being different can cause
[6:45] us to look upon others in negative
[6:47] lights and look upon people in bad ways
[6:49] and look down on people and in doing so
[6:52] that's going to condemn our hearts and
[6:54] in a way of justifying the way that we
[6:56] feel it'll lead us to hate the things
[6:58] that are different than than us and be
[7:00] so far from the spirit nature of this
[7:02] message that it will begin to corrode
[7:04] and corrupt our our good works and our
[7:07] testimony so I want to use the parable
[7:09] of the Good Samaritan to start with
[7:13] tonight and there's so much here that we
[7:15] could use and I I could get kind of lost
[7:18] in this story we ministered on it
[7:20] extensively uh back in 2020 and 2021 and
[7:24] I know all of you remember it just
[7:25] perfectly so I don't need to cover it in
[7:26] any kind of detail but there's a lot
[7:29] that Happening Here leading up to this
[7:31] question by this lawyer about how he
[7:32] could inherit eternal life and really
[7:35] Jesus could have said nothing I said
[7:37] what can I do to inherit eternal life
[7:39] Jesus could have said nothing but it's
[7:41] as if Jesus loves to I want to say toy
[7:44] but he loves to challenge those who want
[7:47] some sort of affirmation that they're
[7:49] good enough that they can accomplish it
[7:51] uh and that they're smart enough or this
[7:53] is something they could do on their own
[7:54] in some ways that's exactly what he did
[7:56] with the Rich Young Ruler we told him oh
[7:58] go sell all that have give to the poor
[8:00] and then come follow me he asked of him
[8:03] something uh that he knew challenged him
[8:06] where he was and so this lawyer saying
[8:08] you know what can I do to get eternal
[8:09] life Jesus saying nothing there's
[8:11] nothing you could do for eternal life he
[8:13] says well what does the law say and he
[8:15] quotes from the law saying that to love
[8:17] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[8:18] all thy soul and all thy strength and
[8:19] all thy mind and love thy neighbor as
[8:22] thyself so this is a good summation
[8:25] Jesus and Paul each one in the New
[8:27] Testament saying this is what everything
[8:28] hangs on and this is how it all can be
[8:30] summed up in this love thy neighbor as
[8:33] thyself so Jesus says you've done well
[8:35] do it and you'll live and the lawyer's
[8:38] response is quite telling because he
[8:41] says willing to justify himself he says
[8:45] and who is my neighbor and if I could
[8:48] just change the question a little bit H
[8:51] and this isn't self-serving in a way it
[8:53] is but it's not necessarily self-serving
[8:55] we're just exploring actually what he's
[8:57] saying cu the question is love thy
[8:59] neighbor as thyself in other words you
[9:02] owe a duty to love your neighbor so when
[9:04] he says who is my neighbor he's actually
[9:07] saying to whom do I owe no duty to love
[9:11] or rather who am I allowed to hate
[9:15] wow I'm just going to preach over here
[9:18] that's good uh that's to me it is a wow
[9:22] when you begin to think if he's kind of
[9:23] carving out well who's my neighbor he's
[9:26] say not so much who can I who am I
[9:28] allowed to love but who do I owe no duty
[9:30] to love who am I allowed to hate CU he's
[9:32] wanting to justify not his love or his
[9:34] selective love he's wanting to justify
[9:37] his hatred and when he says who am I
[9:40] allowed to hate Jesus is going to answer
[9:43] with a parable but let me show how this
[9:46] this uh lawyer would have been very much
[9:49] aware that the issue is hatred because
[9:51] in Luke chapter 19 verses 17 and 18 says
[9:54] Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine
[9:56] heart Thou shalt in any wise rebuke
[10:00] thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him
[10:03] Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[10:05] Grudge and we dealt with some of these
[10:06] things earlier against the children of
[10:09] thy people so they're thinking very
[10:10] particularly converts or to Jews those
[10:13] of the blood but Thou shalt Love Thy
[10:15] Neighbor now this is this escalation
[10:17] this broadening of the scope of whom the
[10:19] duty is too but Thou shalt love thy
[10:21] neighbor as thyself I am the Lord so
[10:25] when it's dealing with not hating thy
[10:27] brother and and being able to rebuke Thy
[10:28] Neighbor but not avenging and not
[10:30] grudging it would have been given that
[10:32] you look out after the house of Israel
[10:34] you're looking after the Seed of Abraham
[10:36] but it talked about how you owe a duty
[10:38] to the stranger you owe a duty to The
[10:40] Foreigner you owe the duty to the one
[10:41] that even though they hate you if
[10:43] they're under their Beast of Burden that
[10:44] you should help them and there's a lot
[10:46] in the law that required service and Aid
[10:49] to those who were not your seed who were
[10:51] foreigners strangers in your land so it
[10:54] says Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[10:56] thyself this lawyer knew that love and
[10:59] hate were at issue and when he says well
[11:01] who's my neighbor willing to justify
[11:03] himself he was wanting to justify his
[11:06] hatred so Jesus in answering this
[11:09] immediately goes to the parable of the
[11:11] Good Samaritan and yet it's not evident
[11:15] at first who he's talking about but he
[11:17] says a certain man went down from
[11:18] Jerusalem to Jericho and he doesn't tell
[11:20] us whether or not he's a Jew he doesn't
[11:22] tell us if he's a Samaritan he just says
[11:24] it was a certain man we could gather
[11:26] that perhaps he was an Israelite coming
[11:28] from Jerusalem him down to Jericho and
[11:30] he falls among Thieves who beat him up
[11:32] who rob him leave him half dead he's
[11:34] just stripped naked and the next person
[11:37] to come upon Him is a priest and the
[11:40] priest sees and recogn he sees this
[11:42] scene he knows what's happening but he
[11:44] passes by on the other side and
[11:46] continues on and there's some that
[11:48] wrestle with the text saying oh well he
[11:50] could he had to keep himself pure and he
[11:52] wouldn't had to touch him and then the
[11:54] next comes a levite he's not a priest
[11:56] he's a levite and yet he kind of he
[11:59] recognizes the same thing and he passes
[12:01] on by and as I I was studying this and I
[12:03] find myself just drawn to it more and
[12:05] more again lately and and just been
[12:08] hearing I think it's just maybe an odd
[12:10] phenomena but just a number of people
[12:11] commenting how they've gone back and
[12:13] started listening to this series on who
[12:14] is my neighbor I think it would be
[12:16] wonderful if we did that any new
[12:18] families or any believers who began
[12:20] coming to this church go back and visit
[12:22] that because it really is good in giving
[12:24] the context for this body that we exist
[12:26] within a a city within a community of
[12:28] the Christians and other churches and we
[12:30] didn't to know who our neighbors are and
[12:32] how to look upon others and treat other
[12:34] people and so I've been looking at this
[12:36] with new eyes and studying it again and
[12:39] I I've come across some things that to
[12:41] me it was kind of like we have these
[12:42] jokes you know he said there's always
[12:44] three people in a joke and and you have
[12:46] this one this one and this one and so
[12:47] it's like a a priest walked into walked
[12:50] into a restaurant and then then a a
[12:52] automobile salesman walked in and then
[12:54] the lawyer and there's always like these
[12:55] threes a preacher doctor and a lawyer
[12:58] and to the Jews they had the same nature
[13:00] with some of their storytelling that
[13:02] there was always a story of the priest
[13:03] the levite and then just the regular
[13:05] average person so this lawyer may have
[13:08] been in that mode this is this modality
[13:10] it's it's going to happen the priest the
[13:11] levite and just your average Joe but
[13:14] then Jesus changes it up completely and
[13:17] instead of maybe going where he expected
[13:19] what would be expected of the average
[13:21] Israelite and so they had this rhythm of
[13:23] Threes And storytelling long before
[13:25] goldilock and so there was some
[13:27] expectation of this third character and
[13:29] brother Travis you might be know that
[13:31] this rule of Threes that even exists
[13:33] within storytelling he use these
[13:34] different characters and then the third
[13:36] one is supposed to bring something out
[13:38] and and show something so Jesus is
[13:40] following this method but then instead
[13:42] of just going to the regular Israelite
[13:44] he introduces the Samaritan and this
[13:46] would have been a completely a complete
[13:48] departure from what these Israelites
[13:50] were
[13:51] expecting and he says but a certain
[13:54] Samaritan and Jesus is very deliberate
[13:57] in his using the Samaritan Luke
[14:00] 10:33 because we know that hatred
[14:02] existed between the Jews and the
[14:04] Samaritans and there was certain natural
[14:07] uh National and religious prejudices uh
[14:09] that created this hostility between the
[14:11] Jews and the Samaritans instead of
[14:13] getting into the history of it the Jews
[14:15] considered them half breeds considered
[14:17] them dogs and it was those who were in
[14:19] Exile who begin to marry amongst the
[14:21] Assyrians uh there was this blending of
[14:24] Assyrian Syrian and Jews and so their
[14:27] children some kind of mixture of the
[14:28] there was some tradition there and some
[14:30] ties to the uh the children of Abraham
[14:33] and they begin to adopt uh certain
[14:35] beliefs same beliefs they believed the
[14:37] first five books of the Bible the
[14:38] pentito were the only true word and
[14:40] believed in the law of Moses and kind of
[14:42] looked down on the Jews because they had
[14:44] to add all these prophets and Poets and
[14:46] all these other things but they believed
[14:47] the law as Moses gave it they had their
[14:50] own Temple they thought was greater than
[14:52] that which was in Jerusalem so there was
[14:53] this kind of competitivness that existed
[14:55] between them and in the Bible you'll
[14:57] find and even a history that the
[14:59] Samaritans were kind of antagonist to
[15:01] the Jewish identity so you had the Jews
[15:04] who were the children of God but then
[15:06] these a Samaritans who claimed to be
[15:08] probably they claimed to be the children
[15:10] of God the original the pure they held
[15:12] to the law the right way and they did
[15:15] everything in their power to annoy the
[15:17] Jews partly because of their
[15:20] similarities but mostly because of their
[15:22] differences and you can see in the
[15:24] scripture that when Jesus talks to the
[15:26] Samaritan woman that her first commment
[15:28] is you Jews don't have any dealings with
[15:30] us I believe it's in the Bible when
[15:32] Jesus has not received uh uh welcomed by
[15:34] the Samaritans in a particular Town what
[15:36] was it the disciples said should we pray
[15:39] that Hellfire be rained down upon these
[15:41] Samaritans so this was kind of their
[15:43] attitude towards them there was this
[15:45] Mutual disdain this Mutual hatred so
[15:48] Jesus uses the Samaritan to teach us not
[15:52] to
[15:53] hate and he's using it to show that we
[15:55] ought to overcome evil with good cuz the
[15:58] again we're looking at the lawyer from
[16:00] the standpoint of saying justifying who
[16:03] he's allowed to hate so he uses the
[16:05] Samaritan one that he would have hated
[16:07] and one that he would have been able to
[16:09] carve out an exception to
[16:11] loving so it says but a certain
[16:13] Samaritan we're still in verse 33 here
[16:14] as he journeyed came where he was and
[16:18] this is this one this certain man who
[16:19] came down from Jerusalem to Jericho and
[16:21] was beaten by thieves and when he saw
[16:23] him says he had compassion on him the
[16:28] Bible tells us he came where he was and
[16:31] if I could say this he saw him as he was
[16:35] and because he saw him as he was then he
[16:37] could come to him amen as as we read and
[16:40] maybe we there's some speculation it's
[16:42] as if the priest sees and knows well
[16:44] enough from where he's at to keep moving
[16:47] on and not to uh not to tell a story on
[16:50] my dad because he's not here to defend
[16:51] himself but I remember one time we were
[16:54] fishing on a lake and as a family we
[16:55] were on the boat and as we were going he
[16:57] noticed somebody way out in the distance
[16:59] it looked like he was siging him he said
[17:01] don't look we're just going to ignore
[17:02] him because by law we must stop and
[17:05] render Aid if they're in distress and so
[17:08] not a I guess he's a pastor not a priest
[17:10] but father mcgi wanted just to keep
[17:12] moving on and and this is maybe this is
[17:15] what the priest was doing is the priest
[17:17] is kind of seeing this and he goes oh
[17:19] man I'm just going to ignore this
[17:21] because if I'm able to perceive that
[17:24] this is one in need then I'm going to
[17:25] have some sort of moral you know
[17:29] obligation to render Aid so I'd rather
[17:31] not know I'd rather not
[17:33] ask and then maybe the
[17:36] levite it's supposes that he kind of
[17:38] looked enough to where he knows because
[17:40] it says he was looking and he came and
[17:42] looked on him and it's going yeah I
[17:44] don't want to deal with this nope right
[17:46] and he gets out of there but now this
[17:49] Samaritan he sees him and he says he
[17:53] came to where he was and saw him and
[17:55] when he sees him it causes him to have
[17:57] compassion so he was willing to take it
[18:00] in he did avert his gaze he he he looked
[18:04] at him and it says he had compassion it
[18:05] means he felt love and pity for him and
[18:08] In This Moment he acts and it says and
[18:10] he went to him verse 34 and bound up his
[18:14] wounds pouring in oil and wine set him
[18:17] on his own beast and brought him to an
[18:19] end and took care of him so quickly
[18:23] Jesus recites a number of activities and
[18:26] actions that are in no wise easy
[18:29] right that are so rich in in love and
[18:33] compassion and service he binds up his
[18:35] wounds he pours in oil and wine think of
[18:38] just what the attention that's being
[18:40] given and the way that he's carrying and
[18:42] then he lifts him as the picture
[18:44] depicts but Jun maybe you could just
[18:46] show that real quick that title slide
[18:48] it's depicted and and the way that Cy
[18:51] did it and even here as van go
[18:53] replicates it it's as if he's still
[18:56] unconscious and he's been bound in look
[18:58] at the labor and the strain that he
[19:00] would have to do to set him up on his
[19:02] own on his own beast of burden and he
[19:05] would set him up on there put him on
[19:07] this horse or whatever it might be and
[19:08] now he's going to walk beside this and
[19:12] bring him to an end and it says and he
[19:14] took care of him it wasn't until the
[19:17] next day now as he spent this whole
[19:19] night with him that he gives charge to
[19:20] the inkeeper and makees sure he has
[19:22] everything he needs but this was an act
[19:25] of
[19:27] compassion this Samaritan who to a Jew
[19:29] would be a half breed a dog it was
[19:32] actually a by word this was a if you
[19:33] wanted to offend another Jew you just
[19:35] call him a Samaritan and yet here's one
[19:38] that's acting better than the levite
[19:40] acting supposedly in the point that's
[19:42] being made better than the
[19:45] priest and as he has placed upon this
[19:49] Beast after having been bound in oil and
[19:52] wine poured in them as we take this
[19:53] image in I want to say this because this
[19:56] is what struck me as this
[19:59] Samaritan came to where he was saw him
[20:02] as he was and then could come to him and
[20:05] help him we often lack compassion
[20:08] because we don't have
[20:10] perspective and we're are we're
[20:12] unwilling to gain it such as the priest
[20:15] and the levite we want to hold on to our
[20:18] our opinions we want to hold on to our
[20:20] judgments and our prejudices we want to
[20:22] hold on to our hate we want to hold on
[20:24] to our criticism we want to hold on to
[20:26] our judgment we say well that's not
[20:27] right this is is wrong and then instead
[20:29] of really taking it in and trying to
[20:31] understand and see it for what it is we
[20:33] avert our gaze very quickly wanting to
[20:35] hold on to our kneejerk reaction amen
[20:37] that's right but he came to where he was
[20:40] this was a humble
[20:41] act might have taken it might have been
[20:43] some a precarious move it might have
[20:46] been again just speculating and painting
[20:48] the picture that the thieves cast his
[20:50] body into a difficult place to reach and
[20:53] tried to cover it up and maybe they
[20:55] hurried him off to some other spot in
[20:57] order to get to him and beat him up and
[20:58] rough him up and do it without the views
[21:00] of others he might have he knew he was
[21:02] putting himself at risk cuz this is one
[21:03] who had just been taken by
[21:05] thieves so it was an act of
[21:08] vulnerability and it it was a humble act
[21:12] and what I think is beautiful is to this
[21:15] Samaritan showing kindness in serving
[21:19] this less unfortunate one was no threat
[21:21] to his
[21:22] identity it was no threat to his worth
[21:24] it was no threat to his testimony he
[21:26] didn't have to worry about what could be
[21:28] said about him there was no
[21:29] self-righteousness there was no fear of
[21:31] stooping down in doing something to help
[21:34] somebody up or be kind to somebody
[21:36] listen I want to speak to it very
[21:37] directly we sometimes confuse
[21:40] righteousness and AAL for God for just
[21:42] some sort of prejudice bias and hate
[21:44] that we have in our hearts towards
[21:45] certain things and we act on it thinking
[21:48] we're doing God a service when in
[21:50] actuality we're just spewing out hate
[21:52] which is of the devil amen thinking that
[21:54] we can't have a kind word we can't help
[21:56] somebody we can't we can't can't even
[21:58] show kindness and just decency to
[22:00] another person in some situation because
[22:02] we need to be Pious and we need to be
[22:04] holy and we're just falling
[22:07] ourselves all right so maybe it is still
[22:09] heavy I don't know challenging at least
[22:11] right brother
[22:12] David but he was able to recognize the
[22:16] reality of this man's condition enough
[22:19] to where he had compassion it wasn't oh
[22:22] yeah there's somebody who needs to put
[22:24] some clothes on right what would we do
[22:26] today if that ain't lay to see you
[22:30] naked you know and laying there naked
[22:34] and just start judging right away about
[22:36] how ridiculous this I can't even go to J
[22:38] Jericho without a naked man laying on
[22:40] the side of the
[22:42] road but he was able to recognize the
[22:44] reality of this man's condition and what
[22:46] really happened that he needed to be
[22:48] ministered to he needed to be his wounds
[22:50] needed to be bound up he needed oil and
[22:51] wine and and that forethought to no this
[22:53] is what he needs uh to rid of infection
[22:56] this is what he needs to begin to
[22:57] promote healing this this is what he
[22:58] needs to protect it going forward and
[23:00] then just not leaving him there say well
[23:01] I've done my duty but to take it the
[23:03] next
[23:04] step and I I feel maybe just compelled
[23:07] to acknowledge this that Jesus often
[23:10] asked very hard things of
[23:12] people who were putting on hirs as if
[23:15] they had it all figured out and so this
[23:18] Parable it doesn't impose upon us a duty
[23:20] to stop and help everyone with a flat
[23:21] tire and give our money away to
[23:23] everybody who's asking for it you have
[23:24] to be real mature when you look at these
[23:26] parables in what Jesus was asking
[23:28] because Jesus acknowledged that there's
[23:30] always going to be poor Among Us when he
[23:32] went to the pool of Bethesda he passed
[23:33] by many other sick people and only
[23:35] healed the one when he sent his
[23:37] disciples out he didn't send them out by
[23:39] themselves he sent them out two by two
[23:40] and made sure they had the things they
[23:42] need so Jesus had a much better a much
[23:45] richer perspective of this than just
[23:46] saying oh we just need to go out and
[23:48] stop everybody and help everybody but he
[23:50] is challenging Prejudice and things in
[23:52] people's hearts with
[23:55] this and I could say this we'll never be
[23:58] able to see correctly until we take the
[24:00] risk of humbling ourselves the same way
[24:03] as we said before get beneath live above
[24:05] and get beneath I want to live above
[24:07] these things live above this all this
[24:09] pretense that's out there and get
[24:11] beneath somebody else if I could help
[24:13] them but all these paradigms of pride
[24:15] and arrogance and uh Prejudice distort
[24:18] our view of those we hate of those that
[24:22] we hold bitterness against and jealousy
[24:23] or animosity those things it's all part
[24:25] of the fabric that we're looking to when
[24:27] we see them and this statement that
[24:30] brother Timothy read on
[24:32] Sunday it is so it was so direct and so
[24:36] you'll see how I'm trying to weave
[24:37] together some of those things that we
[24:38] just heard but it says brother brandham
[24:41] says in the Great Commission May I drop
[24:43] this in this little thing to you
[24:44] Brethren as I know you're different
[24:45] denomination so he's acknowledging kind
[24:47] of this division of beliefs I've never
[24:50] talked like this to a group of people
[24:51] but in this locality here and throughout
[24:53] the nation is becoming now if the devil
[24:55] can keep us separated he's got us
[24:58] shooting at one another so he's got an
[25:00] open Target anywhere he wants to shoot
[25:03] and what's the use of shooting we're
[25:06] shooting one
[25:09] another I I call them tennis matches
[25:11] usually but where one serves the other
[25:13] one return serves and now it's just two
[25:15] people voling back and forth uh trying
[25:17] to beat one another in a game of quote
[25:19] versus quote sermon versus sermon spy
[25:21] versus spy and here brother Brandon puts
[25:23] in terms that you're just shooting it
[25:25] shooting at one another this brother
[25:26] believes this let's just shoot at him
[25:28] over the pulpit this person believes
[25:30] that let's just shoot at him and brother
[25:32] bradam says as long as we're shooting at
[25:34] one another he said the devil doesn't
[25:36] even need to take a shot that's right
[25:38] the devil can just sit back and relax
[25:40] what does that tell you the devil's the
[25:42] one that usually does the shooting but
[25:44] when we start shooting we're doing the
[25:45] devil's bidding amen and we're just
[25:47] mercenaries doing the devil's sniping
[25:50] work and he doesn't have to fire any
[25:53] bullets and then we blame the devil the
[25:55] devil's like not me I didn't pull the
[25:57] trigger you did and God's over there
[25:59] saying that's true you're the one
[26:01] pulling the
[26:02] trigger and we're over there saying
[26:04] you're going to pull this gun from my
[26:05] dead fingers right come and take it
[26:08] because we we believe the right to bear
[26:10] arms and use
[26:12] them he says if I found Grace in your
[26:15] sight though through God you take my
[26:17] word for this Brethren if you want to be
[26:19] a blessing and get a blessing you
[26:22] remember that did you catch that on
[26:23] Sunday that phrasing if you want to be a
[26:24] blessing and get a blessing so you want
[26:26] to bless others and be blessed yourself
[26:28] when a man has done you wrong and he is
[26:30] absolutely justly Noti he's saying look
[26:33] I'm not just saying you think he did you
[26:34] did you wrong he did you wrong I mean he
[26:37] has done you wrong and you know what
[26:39] he's done you wrong he has done you evil
[26:43] don't mention that I believe the way
[26:47] that it strikes me in reading it that
[26:49] maybe it's one of those things where
[26:50] don't just go around telling
[26:52] everybody he says you take him to prayer
[26:54] before God and don't take it in the way
[26:57] of just to selfish and say well I'm
[26:59] supposed to do this the words you go
[27:01] before the Lord and say wow this guy's
[27:03] evil he's horrible he did this to me and
[27:05] he just you're just kind of going about
[27:06] it in a selfish way he says but stand
[27:09] with your shoulder to his
[27:11] shoulder and stand in the presence of
[27:13] God our Father way a prayer should be
[27:16] made in the presence of God and say
[27:19] father here's my brother he deserves
[27:22] punishment because he's done evil and I
[27:25] don't see why he did it now do you
[27:28] recognize just exactly what brother
[27:30] brandham has asked you to do and even
[27:32] what's being implied that in some
[27:34] spiritual way in some dynamic as a child
[27:36] of God you have the ability to Bow your
[27:39] head in your heart and stand before God
[27:41] and bring the offender with you into the
[27:44] presence of God and he says you're
[27:47] standing there shoulder toosh shoulder
[27:49] with your offender and you're there as a
[27:52] victim and you're calling out what has
[27:54] been done to hurt you and you're
[27:56] acknowledging that it's been evil and as
[27:59] you bring it he said it's he's saying
[28:01] now leave it at that kind of what I
[28:04] mentioned recently about how I'm
[28:05] handling things at home that if
[28:07] something has been done is a hurt or
[28:08] offense that somebody's done something
[28:10] wrong if my children ask me to do
[28:13] something by way of addressing it and a
[28:14] a penalty my answer is
[28:17] no Dad Elliott wrecked your car will you
[28:19] ground him nope sorry you just
[28:21] handcuffed me now that he's wrecked the
[28:23] Tesla I got for myself on Christmas
[28:25] instead of him I can't even ground
[28:27] because you asked me to ground him but
[28:29] this is something that I I think about
[28:31] as he standing here say this is an
[28:33] offense this is a wrong but we don't we
[28:35] don't call for
[28:37] Hellfire we don't come up with the
[28:39] punishment he says then let God go to
[28:41] talking to
[28:42] you doesn't this teach us something how
[28:45] that we ought to be sometimes we come
[28:47] and we're looking for advice we're
[28:48] looking for help we're looking for
[28:49] justice we're looking for God to do
[28:50] something for us and we say he did this
[28:52] she did this she did that she did this
[28:54] and then God just starts addressing us
[28:57] and we're like but they're the one that
[28:59] did it he says well they're not I'm
[29:01] talking to you you're the one that
[29:03] brought it up this is the place to start
[29:05] let me deal with your hearts first let
[29:07] me address you first then let God go to
[29:09] talk to you and you'll see maybe what
[29:11] the man's been through why because now
[29:15] you've brought him before you he's there
[29:17] with you in the presence of God and as
[29:20] you stand there in the presence of God
[29:21] you said this man's done me evil now God
[29:24] starts talking to you about what this
[29:25] man did and why he did
[29:28] he says maybe you'll start to see him in
[29:31] a different
[29:33] way you'll see what this man's been
[29:36] through the devil's Twisted him up
[29:38] somewhere and caused him to do that
[29:40] though he's absolutely
[29:42] wrong before you leave the Throne of God
[29:45] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[29:47] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[29:50] so there's your sympathy hold on to that
[29:52] and when you get back down to Earth
[29:54] again woo that beautiful you have have
[29:57] the ability to come up before God in a
[30:00] Heavenly place and bring this person
[30:03] with you shoulder to- shoulder in the
[30:04] presence of God and there things are
[30:06] disclosed things are opened up God
[30:07] begins to deal with your and then when
[30:09] you come back down you're going to be
[30:10] different
[30:11] now when you come back to earth you'll
[30:14] go over to that brother and shake his
[30:15] hand because you know what he's been
[30:17] through you cannot stand with the mortal
[30:21] and the presence of God and condemn
[30:23] anybody that's the statement to write
[30:26] down you cannot stand in the presence of
[30:28] God as a mortal and condemn
[30:31] anybody
[30:33] anybody there's nobody as a mortal that
[30:35] you can condemn in the presence of God I
[30:37] don't believe no sir even if he's a
[30:39] ranked sinner we start thinking well
[30:41] what about this one what about that one
[30:43] what
[30:44] nobody and what about a brother that's
[30:46] made a mistake though I say he's wrong
[30:49] and I love how brother bam continues to
[30:50] acknowledge it's wrong even before God
[30:53] he says and though he's absolutely wrong
[30:56] why is that sometimes we're afraid to go
[30:58] through this exercise it's because we're
[31:00] afraid that somehow we're going to have
[31:03] to accept that it wasn't wrong maybe
[31:06] worse we're afraid that we'll find out
[31:07] that we're the ones that's
[31:10] wrong he says even when he's he's a
[31:13] ranked
[31:15] Sinner and what about a brother that's
[31:17] made a mistake though I say he's wrong
[31:20] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[31:21] not
[31:23] wrong but if he is wrong if we take him
[31:26] to the throne of God stand there
[31:29] shoulder toosh shoulder with our brother
[31:30] I'm telling you this is powerful that we
[31:32] can do this knowing he's Immortal and
[31:36] maybe his destination rest upon your
[31:39] attitude towards
[31:41] him here you see when Christ is standing
[31:44] there crucified upon a cross how we drew
[31:47] from that this this to be like Christ
[31:49] and taking on this figure of Christ and
[31:51] having the mind of Christ we look at
[31:53] here he is on the cross his father
[31:54] forgive them for they know not what they
[31:56] do
[31:58] his eternal destination rest upon your
[32:00] attitude towards him think about how
[32:02] Jesus tells the Rich Young Ruler sell
[32:04] all that halves and give to the poor and
[32:05] come follow me and you'll have eternal
[32:07] life he tells the good he tells this uh
[32:09] lawyer here he says go thou and do
[32:11] likewise as the Good Samaritan this is a
[32:13] heavy ass these are big things to do and
[32:15] then there he as he's dying on the cross
[32:16] and the thief says oh forgive me and he
[32:19] said what did he say this day you'll be
[32:21] with me in Paradise no big ask of him
[32:24] why because Jesus this is his attitude
[32:26] this is what he's looking for this is
[32:28] how that he's instinctive to recognize
[32:30] this one and his eternal destination
[32:33] rest upon his attitude towards him says
[32:36] when we come back from the Throne of God
[32:37] we'll realize that we are everyone
[32:41] guilty and we all need help one from the
[32:44] other not we need help one from another
[32:48] and the best way to do is
[32:50] pray am and there's just so much here
[32:54] yeah so much to begin to think about and
[32:57] how little hurts and offenses and just
[32:59] things that accumulate things that
[33:00] happen in life but he says that you'll
[33:03] begin to feel sorry for him you'll be
[33:05] sympathizing with that brother so he's
[33:06] using a language I think that we all
[33:08] relate to but to have sympathy is the
[33:10] ability to understand and acknowledge
[33:14] the feelings of another person so when
[33:17] you sympathize with someone here he says
[33:19] that you uh you begin to recognize this
[33:22] and you go to sympathizing for him he
[33:25] he's he's using it in the sense that you
[33:27] recognize what he's been through you see
[33:29] that Something's Happened you start to
[33:31] feel this pity for him and you
[33:33] sympathize so it's feelings that you
[33:36] have for someone else feelings of pity
[33:39] feelings of sorrow and I know there's a
[33:42] way that we use that when we say well
[33:44] this person did this to me and this
[33:46] person did that to me go well I just
[33:47] feel sorry for him and I would say that
[33:49] in some ways if we're being hypocritical
[33:51] or we're not really being feeling about
[33:52] it that a true sympathy that's being
[33:54] expressed here is how that you say this
[33:57] man has done evil to me and now by
[34:00] bringing him in the presence of God God
[34:02] is able to open up something to you to
[34:05] now when you look at him your fist
[34:06] aren't clenched teeth clenched wishing
[34:09] that he'd be destroyed forever there's
[34:12] something in you that just that that
[34:14] that anger and heat dissipates and
[34:16] you're just like man I just feel sorry
[34:17] for
[34:18] him he's pitiful man he's in rough shape
[34:22] and man the devil's really got to him to
[34:23] make him do this and the way that he
[34:24] acts and the way that he responds and
[34:26] the all his tropes and everything he
[34:28] does whatever it might be like man what
[34:30] a pitiful
[34:32] creature and I think that we ought to
[34:34] challenge
[34:36] ourselves about whether or not we are
[34:39] allowing God to give us perspective of
[34:43] on
[34:44] others to where we are able to
[34:48] understand the feelings of another
[34:50] person are willing to acknowledge the
[34:52] feelings of another person are we
[34:55] allowing us our our elves this capacity
[34:58] when something happens to say well I
[35:00] mean I see it for what it is and I know
[35:02] what's happened and I know this is wrong
[35:04] but there's context to
[35:06] this and I think even in fellowshipping
[35:08] with some people and even brother Lucas
[35:10] I think uh you've even mentioned this
[35:12] before and it's something that's really
[35:14] really good to remind ourselves I think
[35:15] it's instinctive sometimes for us when
[35:17] our children do something go what is
[35:18] wrong with you and we're really not
[35:21] being psychoanalytical in that point
[35:23] saying there's clearly something wrong
[35:24] with you we need to diagnose the problem
[35:26] but we're more more or less commenting
[35:27] on the situation and that can cause
[35:30] great damage when someone does something
[35:31] and they're kind of being told
[35:32] something's wrong with me but there's a
[35:34] better question to ask sometimes when
[35:36] you see repetitive behavior is what
[35:38] happened to
[35:39] you there's some things that we do as
[35:42] men there's some things maybe we could
[35:43] say this as sisters but there's some
[35:45] things that we do and it's just because
[35:47] we learned it in our family environment
[35:49] and we don't even know that's not the
[35:50] right way to be so the question ought to
[35:53] be what who taught you that how did you
[35:56] learn learn that what happened you to
[35:58] cause you to be that
[35:59] way can we uh
[36:03] accept where someone is coming from can
[36:05] we acknowledge it you know a lot of
[36:07] times it's all people want is they
[36:09] they're wanting to be heard and
[36:10] something happens and it's born from
[36:12] frustration because no one's ever
[36:14] willing just to acknowledge you don't
[36:15] have to agree but at least
[36:17] acknowledge we get so obstinate and
[36:19] stubborn where we don't even want to
[36:20] take time to acknowledge something I've
[36:23] been trying to teach my children and um
[36:25] I I you know I wish I could my wife for
[36:27] this but there's a certain nature in our
[36:28] children that they just hold really
[36:30] strongly to certain ideals and they see
[36:31] all the facts and they're going to argue
[36:32] those facts and those facts alone and I
[36:35] think sometimes it's good to say yeah I
[36:37] think I'm right and all the facts
[36:38] support me as to why Tom Brady's better
[36:40] than Brock pie but you know sometimes
[36:42] you have to soften yourself up a little
[36:44] bit and begin to consider why somebody
[36:46] else might think something like
[36:48] that no matter how crazy that might
[36:51] be but just find yourself acknowledging
[36:54] well I don't agree but I can see where
[36:57] you're coming from otherwise you know
[36:58] what you're saying you're crazy you're
[37:00] out of your mind there's no rational
[37:02] basis to feel that way there's no reason
[37:04] to feel like that and that just makes
[37:05] the chasm worse and worse and worse can
[37:08] we have the capacity to begin to
[37:10] sympathize not agree but acknowledge and
[37:14] understand where someone may be coming
[37:15] from because that's what brother
[37:17] brandham is challenging us on that's
[37:19] what he's saying being in the presence
[37:21] of God will do Peter says it this way in
[37:23] 1 Peter 3: 8 to9 woo we're running out
[37:26] of time time finally be you all of One
[37:29] mind having compassion one of another
[37:32] that means being sympathetic feeling for
[37:34] each other love as Brethren be pitiful
[37:37] be courteous right those are just real
[37:40] strong words that he's challenging us
[37:42] that we ought to be pitiful be courteous
[37:44] love his Brethren having compassion
[37:46] sympathizing and this kind of fits right
[37:48] into it not rendering evil for evil or
[37:50] railing for railing if railed against
[37:52] don't rail back why because you have
[37:54] compassion You're Pitiful you're Court
[37:56] is if Evil's been given don't render
[37:58] evil back he says but contrary wise
[38:00] blessing this is notice how it fits
[38:03] perfectly with brother said if you want
[38:05] to be a blessing and get a blessing
[38:08] start sympathizing so he shows us how to
[38:11] start dealing with this hurt or offense
[38:12] or this evil that's been done to us we
[38:14] bring we go up before God we bring the
[38:16] offender with us shoulder Tosh shoulder
[38:17] we begin to talk about God about it then
[38:19] we let him start talking to us and he
[38:21] says this is how you can be a blessing
[38:23] and be blessed and Peter says instead of
[38:25] rendering evil for evil for raing render
[38:27] a blessing in other words you can be a
[38:29] blessing and you'll be blessed knowing
[38:31] that you are there un to called that you
[38:33] should inherit a
[38:34] blessing this is exactly what brother
[38:36] braham's teaching us Paul dealt with it
[38:39] this way in Colossians 3: 12 and 13 put
[38:41] on therefore as the elect of God holy
[38:43] and beloved bows of mercies it means
[38:47] sympathizing this inward pity inward
[38:50] compassion the the Jews felt like there
[38:53] was there was this connection in the
[38:54] bowels and these even physical organs
[38:56] where it was a source of this love and
[38:58] this Mercy this pity this compassion
[39:00] bows of mercies kindness humbleness of
[39:02] Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing
[39:06] one another forgiving one another If any
[39:08] man have a quarrel against any even as
[39:11] Christ forgave you so also do ye with no
[39:15] qualification if there's a quarrel with
[39:17] somebody else he says just forgive them
[39:20] the first thing we ought to do Lord help
[39:22] us to do it I know this is easy for me
[39:24] to say and much harder to do an
[39:26] application but when something has been
[39:28] done wrong you've been hurt by your
[39:30] spouse they've done something wrong
[39:31] they've betrayed your trust there's
[39:33] great hurts and harms whatever it might
[39:35] be forgive them when you're even when
[39:37] you're mad at them when you're hurt when
[39:39] you're disappointed when you're fearful
[39:40] when you're doubtful do it for your own
[39:42] sake just forgive
[39:45] them and even forgive them knowing that
[39:48] even perhaps their Eternal destination
[39:50] depends upon your attitude towards them
[39:52] any quarrel
[39:54] forgive brother bam kind of carries the
[39:57] same thought if you notice in doors
[39:58] inside door inside the door it's just a
[40:01] few days before he makes this comment in
[40:04] the great Great Commission he says you
[40:07] know what a blessing is do something for
[40:09] somebody
[40:11] else it's a m drop moment right just
[40:13] stop it right there you want to know a
[40:15] blessing is and you know what we all
[40:16] thought oh yeah like when you give me
[40:19] something that's a blessing but he says
[40:22] do something for somebody else that's
[40:24] right and if you have a neighbor or
[40:27] somebody that's done you Injustice
[40:29] remember this for me don't never turn
[40:31] him down or don't ever turn him down
[40:33] don't try to get off on the double
[40:35] negative don't ever turn him down take
[40:38] him to God in prayer and see what a
[40:41] different attitude you'll
[40:43] have if you're sincere in prayer you
[40:45] stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him
[40:47] though he's done you wrong Injustice
[40:50] again he's dealing with kind of that
[40:51] mental bias we have where it's like well
[40:54] if I forgive I'm saying he didn't do
[40:55] anything wrong if I forgive him then I'm
[40:57] saying it was okay if I forgive him then
[40:58] I'm inviting the cont uh conduct again
[41:01] no though he's done you wrong Injustice
[41:04] but you just take that man to God and
[41:06] stand there in the presence of the
[41:07] father one time and say father my
[41:09] neighbor here has done me wrong but I
[41:12] guess he says watch when you go to tell
[41:13] and his wrong it not only helps him but
[41:16] it'll help you also to
[41:19] God and you'll see what he's been
[41:22] through in the Temptations and things
[41:25] it'll change your attitude towards that
[41:27] brother and it'll help him also you
[41:30] always are doing good when you're
[41:32] praying one for the other you want to do
[41:34] good pray for Somebody Pray for each
[41:35] other recognize here how in both of
[41:38] these instances both of them together to
[41:40] where I would say this is kind of
[41:41] brother brand in this time period is
[41:43] dealing with the same thing from the
[41:45] same Vantage Point you'll see what he's
[41:48] been through and it changes your
[41:50] attitude there's something about being
[41:52] able to understand where a person's
[41:54] coming from they they might say
[41:57] something really nasty to you and do
[41:58] something very nasty to you and it's
[42:00] absolutely wrong it's an injustice but
[42:02] when you understand where they're coming
[42:04] from you like oh well okay now I see why
[42:08] you did that right like whenever in some
[42:11] of these situations where it's just
[42:12] simply a misunderstanding yeah they
[42:13] should have never flown off the handle
[42:15] they should have never done that but
[42:17] they perceive something or something
[42:19] happened and interrupted things or maybe
[42:21] you just forgot a word and a text you
[42:22] sent out and it blew everything up and
[42:25] you're like oh well I had no
[42:27] idea right well why are they running me
[42:29] down why did they blast me why did they
[42:31] do this and it's like well you find out
[42:33] later that your best friend whom you
[42:34] told that you didn't like them and
[42:35] thought all these things about them told
[42:36] them and they're like oh well you know
[42:38] never mind I didn't know they knew how I
[42:40] really felt about them right and then
[42:42] you kind of get to feel a little
[42:43] sheepish because you realize now it's
[42:45] your own animus and it's your own
[42:46] bitterness and it's your own jealousy
[42:48] that provoke them to act that
[42:51] way keep preaching like this this
[42:53] pastor's never going to have me back
[42:55] again
[42:58] Galatians chapter 6: 1 and 2 because I
[43:01] want you to recognize this this might
[43:03] seem to be a little bit of a
[43:05] a a quick turn
[43:07] here but there's
[43:10] a you see his Temptations you see what
[43:14] he's been through you recognize how
[43:15] brother BR saying that you call out his
[43:17] Heir and his wrong but now God's able to
[43:20] give you a better view of this person
[43:22] and you see what made him do it or made
[43:24] her do it The Temptations the devil
[43:27] twisting them up now there's something
[43:29] here I think I want us to catch it's not
[43:32] this attitude of that poor fool just
[43:34] always letting the devil get them I
[43:37] never do that right it's not this matter
[43:39] of you pity them because man they're
[43:40] just always falling into a traper snare
[43:43] but you can do more than just sympathize
[43:46] like you can
[43:47] relate because in Galatians chapter 6: 1
[43:50] and2 bre if a man be overtaken in a
[43:52] fault ye which are spiritual restore
[43:54] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[43:57] I I say this with absolute certainty the
[43:59] reason why some people are incapable of
[44:02] addressing someone who's an heir with
[44:04] the spirit of meekness it's because
[44:05] they're not spiritual to begin
[44:07] with because only those which are
[44:10] spiritual can restore one with a spirit
[44:11] of
[44:12] meekness too often people do it harshly
[44:15] because they're afraid of their own
[44:16] weaknesses and they and they lack
[44:18] meekness but notice how he says
[44:20] considering thyself lest thou also be
[44:24] tempted bear ye one another's burdens
[44:27] and so fulfill the law of Christ so this
[44:30] the law of Christ is love thy neighbor
[44:32] as thyself everything can be summed up
[44:34] we see what Christ taught as his law but
[44:36] we're to Bear one another's burdens now
[44:39] let me be very clear as brother brandham
[44:40] uses this kind of language this is not
[44:43] justifying what somebody else has done
[44:46] this is not excusing what somebody else
[44:48] has done nor is it approving of what
[44:50] somebody else has done I think sometimes
[44:53] we abandon our Aid and our ministry to
[44:55] other people because we're afraid in
[44:57] being Christ to them it's going to
[44:59] approve of what they've done it's going
[45:01] to give it's going to be accepting of
[45:03] what they've done it's going to be
[45:03] justifying and excusing what they've
[45:05] done when in reality we can fulfill the
[45:08] law of Christ by supporting and helping
[45:11] someone without approving what they've
[45:14] done only a real Christian could do that
[45:18] and what we do is we just deprive we
[45:20] just deprive somebody of love because we
[45:24] don't want to approve of what they're
[45:26] doing and that's the same as
[45:30] hate to withhold intimacy to withhold uh
[45:34] love to withhold something that's due
[45:35] somebody to to bring this Gap and and I
[45:38] can show you through scripture and
[45:39] through human nature that that's exactly
[45:41] what hate is to deprive somebody of what
[45:43] they're do that's hatred and we do it
[45:46] because we're afraid somehow some way
[45:48] it's going to justify our excuse or
[45:51] approve I know maybe it deserves a lot
[45:53] more time than I'm giving this but I
[45:56] hope it's challenging some of our
[45:57] Notions sometimes of what we think is
[45:59] right and that person's rescue we're
[46:02] depriving that person of their rescue
[46:05] from
[46:06] sin because we have the wrong kind of
[46:08] attitude towards
[46:09] them and this is how Paul addresses
[46:14] it considering thine own self lest thou
[46:18] also be
[46:19] tempted I believe that when he says this
[46:23] it's an admonition Beyond just accepting
[46:25] that you can fail and I know that that
[46:28] kind of obvious on its face is here
[46:30] someone who has been taken overtaken in
[46:32] a fault and Paul saying if you're
[46:34] spiritual restore this one in the spirit
[46:36] of meekness considering also that you
[46:39] could be
[46:40] tempted so you're considering your own
[46:42] selves but I I believe that there's more
[46:44] to it that he's not just asking you to
[46:47] acknowledge Your Capacity to sin but
[46:50] it's an admonition to accept that you
[46:53] it's also an admonition to empathy not
[46:56] that you could sin but that you've been
[46:58] there before
[46:59] too that you know what it's like and so
[47:03] here's kind of an actual difference
[47:05] between sympathy and empathy whereas
[47:07] sympathy is this the ability to
[47:09] understand the feelings of another
[47:11] person or acknowledge how another person
[47:13] feels empathy is the ability to
[47:16] understand and share the feelings of
[47:18] another person to you can actually
[47:20] relate to what they're going through not
[47:22] just go man I know that's got to be
[47:24] really tough to have that happen to you
[47:25] never happened to me but I can see how
[47:27] that would be rough to empathize and say
[47:29] I know exactly how it feels to be in
[47:33] your
[47:34] situation it's actually seeing things
[47:36] from someone's point of view if I could
[47:39] put it this way it's it's walking in
[47:40] someone else's shoes say I've gone down
[47:43] that road before I know what it's like
[47:46] and and just to give a an example
[47:48] there's a lot of things to where you can
[47:50] empathize with someone else is going
[47:52] through even though you can't share
[47:53] their actual experience but it's that
[47:56] it's being able to see something from
[47:58] someone's Vantage Point there's a poem
[48:01] written by uh a Mary LA from Jackson
[48:04] Michigan good old Michigan it was called
[48:06] judge softly you'll recognize some
[48:08] sayings in this that are very common in
[48:09] our in our language pray don't find
[48:12] fault with the man that limps or
[48:14] stumbles along the road unless you have
[48:16] worn the moccasins he wears or stumbled
[48:18] beneath the same load there may be tears
[48:21] in his Souls that hurt though hidden
[48:23] away from view the burdens he bears
[48:25] placed on your back may cause you to
[48:27] stumble and fall too don't sneer at the
[48:30] man who's down today unless you have
[48:32] felt the same blow that caused his fall
[48:34] or felt the shame that only the Fallen
[48:36] know you may be strong but still the
[48:38] blows that were his unknown to you in
[48:40] the same way may cause you to stagger
[48:42] and fall too don't be too harsh with the
[48:45] man that sins or Pelt him with words or
[48:47] stone or disdain unless you are sure you
[48:50] have no sins of your own and it's only
[48:52] wisdom and love that your heart contains
[48:54] for you know if if the tempter's voice
[48:56] should whisper as soft to you as it did
[48:59] to him when he went astray it might
[49:01] cause you to falter too just walk a mile
[49:04] in his moccasins before you abuse
[49:06] criticize and accuse if just for one
[49:08] hour you could find a way to see through
[49:10] his eyes instead of your own muse I
[49:13] believe you'd be surprised to see that
[49:15] you've been blind and narrow-minded even
[49:17] unkind there are people on reservations
[49:20] and in ghettos who have so little hope
[49:22] and too much worry on their minds
[49:24] brother there be but
[49:26] brother there but for the grace of God
[49:27] go you and I just for a moment slip into
[49:31] his mind and traditions and see the
[49:32] world through his spirit and eyes before
[49:34] you cast a stone or falely judge his
[49:36] conditions remember to walk a mile in
[49:39] his moccasins and remember the lessons
[49:41] of humanity taught to you by your elders
[49:43] we will be known Forever by the tracks
[49:45] we leave in others people's lives are
[49:47] kindness and generosity take the time to
[49:50] walk a mile in his moccasins may not be
[49:53] politically correct or woke these days
[49:56] but to deprive to to get rid of this is
[49:58] to lose what it really means to
[50:00] understand and relate to really see what
[50:04] beautiful poetry showing us of what it
[50:06] means to consider
[50:08] thyself you you too to see something
[50:11] from someone else's point of view to
[50:13] have empathy it's this mode of
[50:14] intentionality that makes it possible to
[50:17] access what somebody else is going
[50:19] through cuz it's their subjective
[50:21] experience but you're able to access it
[50:23] with the awareness even that experience
[50:26] isn't your own but you're able to you're
[50:28] able to get in there you're able to see
[50:31] it for what it is the Bible says in
[50:34] Romans 12:15 Rejoice with them that do
[50:36] rejoice and weep with them that weep
[50:40] that's
[50:41] empathy it's not it's not hearing that
[50:43] somebody's gotten this and they're happy
[50:45] and you see that they're happy oh well I
[50:47] know what it's like to be happy so
[50:50] congratulations it's to Rejoice also and
[50:53] how can you truly Rejoice unless you can
[50:55] empath aiz my best way of expressing
[50:57] this is uh kind of with in my life I got
[51:00] married when I was 30 most of my friends
[51:02] were much older than me even to now
[51:04] where my friends all have grandchildren
[51:05] are probably going to be
[51:06] great-grandchildren before I'm a grandpa
[51:08] but there's there was always this
[51:10] congratulations when a friend would have
[51:12] a baby congratulations man I was smiles
[51:14] and I was happy but then as soon as
[51:16] Elliott was born I was like man those
[51:17] were the worthless most empty
[51:19] congratulations ever offered because I
[51:22] didn't even know what I was saying but
[51:25] then once I had my own child and it's
[51:26] not just you Elliott the rest of them
[51:28] too added to that feeling but there was
[51:30] this sense of wow whereas now when
[51:32] someone has a baby I'm like oh my
[51:35] goodness this is so awesome you can't
[51:37] lose having kids and it's such a gift
[51:39] it's such a blessing and I I'm not just
[51:42] saying oh I'm happy for you but I'm
[51:44] rejoicing with those that rejoice and I
[51:46] can say this in the same way some of you
[51:48] who've lost people very close to you
[51:50] very dear as brother Timothy said he
[51:52] lost his wife very young in the in the
[51:54] Lord and serving the lord he's somebody
[51:56] who cannot just say I'm sorry if you've
[51:58] lost a loved one but he can empathize
[52:00] there's a level level of Sorrow that I
[52:02] can't achieve because maybe I haven't
[52:04] lost someone very close but I've had
[52:07] I've had loved ones people I was close
[52:08] to and even converts take their life in
[52:10] different things and you can begin to
[52:12] relate to how that would feel so on some
[52:14] level you're not just Sorrowing you
[52:17] empathize you rejoice when they Rejoice
[52:19] You Weep when they weep your
[52:22] congratulations or your condolences come
[52:24] from a place of I'm not having your
[52:26] experience but I'm able to tap into it
[52:28] I'm not just sympathetic I'm
[52:31] empathetic this statement stands out to
[52:33] me the sermon broken sisters he's
[52:35] preaching it on July 23rd 1965 the
[52:38] headline in the New York Times that day
[52:39] was that Lyon B Johnson was admitted to
[52:42] the hospital with a raspy cough they
[52:43] admitted him because he had great pain
[52:45] in his chest and they said they were
[52:46] going to keep him for five days it was
[52:48] kind of like for a cough and then
[52:50] brother Bram says our heavenly father
[52:51] he's praying he says our heavenly father
[52:53] we're standing in a desperate need for
[52:55] the leader of our nation our president
[52:58] and I I know what what you Republicans
[53:00] are thinking right and you know how
[53:02] you're just
[53:03] like you know is it be like asking you
[53:06] to pray for Biden
[53:08] right hey and Hey listen I'm just gonna
[53:11] be honest I know how some of you feel
[53:13] very un Christlike when it comes to
[53:14] somebody of another political
[53:17] affiliation that's good right you're a
[53:20] visitor you can just you can really get
[53:21] behind it we'll we'll even remove that
[53:24] the technology is there just remove your
[53:26] voice they won't be able to find out who
[53:27] you are undercover agent you know just
[53:30] in there getting behind things listen
[53:33] there's it's true we're so quick to
[53:36] justify real genuine nastiness towards
[53:40] somebody and here's brother Brandon play
[53:41] praying
[53:43] for Lyndon B Johnson right and this is
[53:46] the moment where he saying well not
[53:47] everything he said was th sayth the Lord
[53:49] right prophets make mistakes too but
[53:52] this is real our heavenly father we're
[53:55] standing in desperate need for the
[53:56] leader of our nation our president he
[53:58] may never know this Lord but you know it
[54:00] I pray for brother Johnson as he
[54:02] professes to be a believer in you all
[54:04] right that's it I'm leaving the
[54:06] message and you think it's funny but
[54:08] people will do it over politics because
[54:11] it doesn't scratch their hate I pray for
[54:14] brother Johnson as he professes to be a
[54:17] believer in you and father a heart
[54:19] attack we understand has struck him that
[54:21] thought found that to be very
[54:22] interesting I pray God spare his life
[54:25] we're in a national crisis right now let
[54:27] thy Spirit come upon them Lord and right
[54:29] now in the hospital wherever he may be
[54:30] let your spirit come down to that Walter
[54:32] Reed hospital and touch his body sparing
[54:35] his life Lord now this is where I saw
[54:37] the empathy that man's Under Pressure
[54:40] more pressure than what we understand so
[54:43] we pray God as Believers and as a part
[54:45] of this nation we pray for our leader
[54:48] that you will grant him an extension of
[54:50] life in this great hour oh and I thought
[54:53] here he's not a pro president pres but
[54:55] he's a prophet he's not leading a nation
[54:58] but he's leading a bride and he's a lead
[55:00] he can understand the pressure of people
[55:03] looking to him he could empathize what
[55:05] this man was going through he says I
[55:07] profess I pray for him as a brother
[55:10] since he professes to be a believer in
[55:12] you it'll help us even change our
[55:15] attitude towards
[55:16] Trump we pray for our leader as
[55:19] Believers as part of this great nation
[55:22] he says we understand he's got to be
[55:23] under so much pressure that's
[55:26] empathy in Hebrews chapter
[55:30] 4 verses 15 and
[55:33] 16 we're just about we're about to wrap
[55:36] up
[55:36] here and just stick with me a little
[55:39] bit he says for we have not a high
[55:42] priest I catch this we have not a high
[55:44] priest which cannot be
[55:46] touched with the filling of our
[55:49] infirmities but was in all points
[55:51] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[55:55] let us therefore come boldly which is
[55:57] honestly under the throne of grace there
[55:59] there doesn't need to be pretense you
[56:01] don't need you you can come honestly
[56:03] before the throne of grace you don't
[56:04] need to hide anything you don't need to
[56:06] have this pretense and these HS of well
[56:08] I need this and I need that you can just
[56:09] admit it because Jesus will understand
[56:12] he'll empathize so we can come boldly we
[56:15] don't have to come with HS or pretense
[56:17] under the throne of grace that we may
[56:18] obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
[56:22] time of need I like to say this this is
[56:25] more than sympathy but empathy well
[56:28] brother Bram said we realize that we're
[56:31] everyone guilty what did that provoking
[56:33] you when you were Before the Throne
[56:36] empathy not sympathizing and saying oh
[56:40] you know this guy is's just a devil I
[56:42] just feel sorry for him it's you realize
[56:45] man I do some of the same
[56:47] things yeah maybe I don't do it as bad
[56:49] but I or I've done that before are you
[56:51] listening to me it's empathy I think I
[56:55] believe my original title I was going to
[56:57] use is compassion with empathy because I
[57:00] I wanted to use this this idea of
[57:03] compassion but then take it a step
[57:05] further that it's it's more than just
[57:07] compassion it's more than having pity
[57:09] but it's having empathy because we have
[57:11] a high priest which can be touched which
[57:14] means have compassion but it's more than
[57:16] just have compassion but it means to be
[57:18] affected with the same feeling as
[57:22] another so it's not that he's up there
[57:25] sinless and you're to go oh I'm being
[57:27] tempted and he's like man I just I I
[57:30] know that's got to be hard I don't know
[57:32] what it's like but I know that's got to
[57:33] be difficult but he was tempted yet
[57:36] without sin but then also he became sin
[57:39] righten he has a level of empathy did he
[57:43] ever commit sin no but he has a level of
[57:46] empathy where he knows what it's like
[57:48] yes he could be sympathetic to those who
[57:50] do sin but I'm saying there's more to it
[57:52] he can be affected with the same feeling
[57:55] that when you go to them with the
[57:57] feeling say I know what you're
[58:00] feeling it's
[58:03] empathy he can be touched the scripture
[58:05] talks about it's compassion I I know
[58:07] kind of the the way that we're the way
[58:09] we kind of built our Theology and and I
[58:12] say this because I remember I know for
[58:14] me just getting really really
[58:16] legalistic um you know he he called
[58:19] Lyndon B Johnson brother Johnson and and
[58:22] I had just this strict rubric in my life
[58:25] that basically if somebody denied
[58:26] certain evident tenants in the message
[58:28] I'd be like how could I call him brother
[58:30] I mean really come on right how can they
[58:33] really be my brother if they're outright
[58:35] denying certain basic truths of the
[58:37] message and I realize what value is
[58:40] there in that true just just I'm going
[58:43] to show myself different like oh well
[58:44] you know bless you dude right I'm not g
[58:48] to say brother I'm just going to say
[58:50] their name a a and deprive them of that
[58:53] when brother Brandon would call Lind be
[58:55] Johnson the president brother Johnson
[58:57] that's
[58:58] instructive that tells us something
[59:00] about our attitudes and how we're
[59:02] looking down on people and how we allow
[59:03] to hold on to these prejudices and these
[59:05] spites and so brother Bram tells us that
[59:08] real Divine compassion is to do the will
[59:11] of him that sent you to do it he said
[59:13] that's what agape love is so we know
[59:15] there's this big confusion about real
[59:16] compassion in real love we say well
[59:18] Jesus didn't have compassion because he
[59:20] didn't heal all the other sick at the
[59:22] pool of Bethesda but he was doing what
[59:24] God asked him to do that's real Divine
[59:28] compassion is to do the will of God but
[59:30] let me say this the real Divine
[59:33] compassion will never lead you to
[59:35] violate the word of God compromise the
[59:37] word of God deny the word of God or
[59:39] otherwise reject the word of God you
[59:42] cannot say that you're just doing the
[59:44] will of God and exhibiting agape love in
[59:47] real Divine compassion when you're
[59:49] hating and you're exhibiting nastiness
[59:52] I'm just going to use that as an
[59:53] umbrella to cover all those things we
[59:54] can talk
[59:56] about to do the will of him you have to
[1:00:00] love thy neighbor as thyself you have to
[1:00:02] do un good good to those who
[1:00:04] despitefully use you and then you'll
[1:00:06] find that the word of God is very
[1:00:07] explicit about what his will is and how
[1:00:10] we treat other
[1:00:12] people so as I bring it to this
[1:00:15] musicians if you'd like to
[1:00:17] come I'm giving you the option because I
[1:00:20] could just keep preaching all night but
[1:00:21] this will help bring it to a close
[1:00:23] empathy
[1:00:25] a remedy for a remedy not saying it's
[1:00:27] all of it but it's a remedy for
[1:00:29] hate because we don't allow our hearts
[1:00:32] to become
[1:00:33] hard we don't get
[1:00:35] cold but we have
[1:00:39] empathy a change of perspective can
[1:00:41] change your
[1:00:44] heart where it melts feelings of
[1:00:47] resentment it it takes away the
[1:00:51] bitterness I if I could put it I I think
[1:00:54] even in more innocent context I maybe in
[1:00:56] the way that we're talking about
[1:00:58] sometimes it does pit it in sides where
[1:00:59] you have like the the North and the
[1:01:00] South Waring in a civil war and it's
[1:01:02] just such deepr rooted hatred and
[1:01:04] there's been this great big Chasm and
[1:01:06] they're on different sides of a Warfare
[1:01:08] but sometimes it's just right within our
[1:01:10] own home that's right a and a husband
[1:01:12] and wife or a parent to a child just get
[1:01:14] on different
[1:01:15] sides and something can be done that's
[1:01:18] wrong it's a betrayal it hurts and his
[1:01:20] brother B saying it's wrong it's evil
[1:01:23] it's it it it there's no justifying or
[1:01:25] excusing it but from your St vantage
[1:01:28] point of being the one that's hurt you
[1:01:31] don't ever allow yourself the
[1:01:32] opportunity of understanding what
[1:01:35] happened to
[1:01:36] them and why they did what they did and
[1:01:40] even though what they ultimately did
[1:01:41] hurt you and cause great hurt you don't
[1:01:44] understand that where it ultimately came
[1:01:46] from is it was the devil that got them
[1:01:48] twisted up it's not because they hate
[1:01:49] you it's not because they're at war with
[1:01:51] you it's not because it's it's not as
[1:01:53] bad as you're making it out out to be if
[1:01:55] you could just understand what made him
[1:01:57] do
[1:01:58] it and sometimes if you just can begin
[1:02:01] to empathize with the other person it
[1:02:03] begins to melt the
[1:02:05] bitterness and you realize I'm hurt for
[1:02:07] what you did I'm very very hurt by what
[1:02:09] you did and I've got my own hurt to deal
[1:02:12] with but I understand now why you did
[1:02:17] what you did what made you that way and
[1:02:21] now we can together I'm not your enemy
[1:02:22] I'm not your ad even though I'm the
[1:02:24] victim and this I'm I want together
[1:02:27] together let's heal
[1:02:30] amen and that's because I I don't think
[1:02:33] that we should ever look at our spouses
[1:02:35] and our children and our neighbors as
[1:02:36] our enemy so that if we're asked to love
[1:02:39] our enemies to love those that hate us
[1:02:41] it should just be this trickle down it's
[1:02:43] like if I'm asked to do that then how
[1:02:45] much more is brother BR said what about
[1:02:47] your brother who makes a
[1:02:49] mistake I'll be brother Timothy even
[1:02:51] mentioned this on Sunday in the sermon
[1:02:53] that day on Calvary
[1:02:55] he said he lived and had eternal life
[1:02:58] because he did not live for himself he
[1:03:00] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:03:02] life by receiving that day and you don't
[1:03:04] live for yourself no more you live for
[1:03:07] others that day is that day on Calvary
[1:03:10] someone said how can you stand and let
[1:03:12] anyone call you such bad names here's
[1:03:15] your this is the a remedy a remedy for
[1:03:19] hate remedy for bitterness he says you
[1:03:22] don't live for yourself you live for
[1:03:25] others that you might redeem that man
[1:03:27] what man is he talking about the one
[1:03:28] who's spewing out the hate you become
[1:03:31] sons and the trouble of it is that the
[1:03:34] church has forgot they were Sons you are
[1:03:37] Sons you're taking Christ's place you
[1:03:40] are Sons so don't live for yourself live
[1:03:43] for others well brother BR I can live
[1:03:45] for this brother because he sure is a
[1:03:47] nice man that's not it live for the man
[1:03:51] that hates
[1:03:53] you live for that person who would kill
[1:03:56] you if they
[1:04:00] could could we get a clear uh tape on
[1:04:03] this to be sure that's not what he said
[1:04:05] are we sure we filtered this down
[1:04:08] enough were they do using some sort of
[1:04:10] AI on this and generating this live for
[1:04:14] the person that would kill you if they
[1:04:15] could that's what they did to him they
[1:04:18] killed him and he died that he might
[1:04:20] save them that's eternal life when
[1:04:23] that's in your bosom notice now it's
[1:04:25] perspective you're facing heaven then
[1:04:28] you're not facing the offender you're
[1:04:31] not facing the evil we've got to change
[1:04:33] perspective because when we're facing
[1:04:35] heaven and if we can have the courage to
[1:04:37] bring up our offender in the presence of
[1:04:39] God and now we're standing
[1:04:40] shoulder-to-shoulder with the one that's
[1:04:41] hurt us and we're standing there facing
[1:04:43] Heaven it's there in that perspective
[1:04:45] that things can change he says you're
[1:04:47] facing heaven then but then you
[1:04:48] sacrifice your own things give them up
[1:04:50] like the sheep gives its wool you look
[1:04:52] on towards Calvary
[1:04:55] that's what's going to give us the
[1:04:56] empathy I believe that we can relate can
[1:04:59] we not
[1:05:00] relate we've often said things hateful
[1:05:03] we've often done things wrong we've
[1:05:04] betrayed we've lied we've stole we've
[1:05:06] killed we've done all those things we
[1:05:08] were Sinners too and as the poet said
[1:05:11] but for the grace of God there goeth I I
[1:05:14] I have walked a mile in his moccasins I
[1:05:17] have been there before but somebody who
[1:05:19] loved me who turned his back on my sins
[1:05:22] there was one who rescued me that's
[1:05:25] right am why because let's just admit it
[1:05:27] we're the
[1:05:29] Samaritans we're the ones that are EST
[1:05:31] stranged we're the ones that were uh uh
[1:05:34] heathens we were the ones broken from
[1:05:36] the promise We're The Pretenders but he
[1:05:37] loved us and he redeemed
[1:05:40] us so much that we could realize that
[1:05:43] the hate for sin his God detested he
[1:05:46] hates it he hates Pride he hates lies
[1:05:49] and guess what we're born in the world
[1:05:51] doing it but yet he did not let his hate
[1:05:54] for
[1:05:55] sin deprive us of the love he had for
[1:05:59] our
[1:06:00] souls and I believe it challenges us to
[1:06:03] be more empathetic and I hope it helps
[1:06:06] in this there's so much more we can
[1:06:07] Minister on this subject after having
[1:06:09] dealt with hate for so long I think
[1:06:11] there's it's a challenge to us that when
[1:06:14] we go through a situation maybe it's not
[1:06:16] rising to the level of hate maybe it's
[1:06:17] not rising to the level of betrayal but
[1:06:19] all these little things that happen if
[1:06:20] we could just try to understand the
[1:06:23] situation a little bit better and give
[1:06:25] context think of it this way often times
[1:06:28] we're EAS we're very quick to justify
[1:06:30] ourselves like well I do this because
[1:06:32] that's my personality that's the way I
[1:06:33] am that's the way I'm just this way but
[1:06:35] we never give the benefit of Doubt to
[1:06:36] somebody else and that's what empathy
[1:06:39] can be you know what I can be really
[1:06:40] weird I'll let them be weird
[1:06:42] too I can do this I can do that I
[1:06:45] understand where they're coming from it
[1:06:46] doesn't mean you're excused nor they
[1:06:48] excuse but it's recognized in a
[1:06:50] situation where it's already bad let's
[1:06:52] not make it worse
[1:06:54] [Music]
[1:06:57] and maybe it comes down to even being a
[1:06:58] little bit more empathetic with
[1:07:02] ourselves and because we're not willing
[1:07:04] to give ourselves
[1:07:05] room to grow and to make mistakes and to
[1:07:08] change we're not willing to do with
[1:07:10] others there's a whole lot we can learn
[1:07:12] from this could we pray together tonight
[1:07:15] if you'll just stand together with me
