[0:00] first corinthians chapter 10
[0:02] verse 31 i'd like to read this
[0:05] and provided it for you on the slide
[0:07] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 31
[0:09] it's very short
[0:12] and i hope that you can just
[0:14] really ponder just the depth of this
[0:16] paul
[0:17] is teaching us
[0:19] um
[0:20] so many wonderful things in this uh
[0:22] talking about even how we ought to be
[0:24] servants and
[0:26] uses israel as an example and he's going
[0:28] to talk about proper worship and
[0:29] communion even get into the lord's
[0:31] supper diversities of gifts there's a
[0:33] lot that he's dealing with he makes this
[0:34] statement kind of in the middle of all
[0:36] these things i think is very very
[0:37] important
[0:38] whether therefore ye eat or drink or
[0:40] whatsoever ye do
[0:42] do all to the glory of god
[0:44] whatsoever therefore you eat or drink or
[0:46] whatsoever ye do and that kind of
[0:48] becomes all-encompassing due all to
[0:51] the glory of god lord bless you you can
[0:53] be seated
[0:58] all right i made uh i mentioned this now
[1:02] i made two statements or did two things
[1:03] on sunday that i think have had people a
[1:05] little bit perplexed
[1:07] the last thing i did is i in in praying
[1:09] at the end of service i entered into
[1:10] what is called intercessory prayer and i
[1:13] had at least a half a dozen people ask
[1:14] me if everything was okay afterwards
[1:16] and uh just because of what i was
[1:18] praying and so
[1:19] i think i'm fine but sometimes the
[1:22] spirit gives utterance to things that we
[1:23] don't know but it was just a feeling
[1:25] that came on me as i began to pray and i
[1:27] felt that i was praying for somebody
[1:28] else we talked about a decision a
[1:31] crossroads or being at a decision or
[1:32] being in a cycle that someone feels that
[1:34] they can't break out of
[1:35] that was just me opening up my heart and
[1:37] beginning to pray so i always i was
[1:39] happy to know that many people were
[1:41] praying for me i thought i had that
[1:42] going for me but i wouldn't want you to
[1:44] be worried that somehow everything's
[1:45] falling apart
[1:46] and i was losing having a crisis there
[1:49] at the end of service
[1:51] having said that the other thing i did
[1:52] is i just showed a graphic and it was
[1:54] kids eat free on wednesdays and i'm not
[1:56] even gonna explain it tonight
[1:57] you're just gonna have to ponder it but
[1:59] kids eat free
[2:01] and tonight i noticed that the slide
[2:02] didn't save right and i spent way too
[2:04] much time trying to figure that out but
[2:06] my title and i i first i want to let put
[2:09] this way i want to start a new segment
[2:11] being a segment it's not necessarily
[2:12] serious it doesn't mean we'll pick it up
[2:13] on sunday or even next wednesday just be
[2:15] a segment we get to every once in awhile
[2:17] called kids eat free you can just ponder
[2:18] that chew on it a little bit
[2:20] pun intended
[2:21] and uh you get what you expect so if
[2:23] you're expecting a kid's mill
[2:25] if you have enough faith maybe you'll
[2:26] get one
[2:27] but uh in the natural that is but this
[2:30] will be the first installment uh in this
[2:32] segment of kids eat free like to do it
[2:34] on wednesday nights as the lord would
[2:36] lead and the title this the subject i
[2:37] wanted to explore tonight is digging for
[2:39] gold
[2:41] and you could show the next slide
[2:42] whether john will just use this as our
[2:45] launching point
[2:47] and this
[2:48] subject matter
[2:50] digging for gold i want to use this kind
[2:52] of what has been burning to me is last
[2:54] november that the lord put this on my
[2:55] heart and began exploring it is that
[2:58] there's a hidden there's a hidden glory
[2:59] of the family
[3:00] there's ways that we look at the family
[3:02] think about the family and we see
[3:03] certain things that are maybe important
[3:05] or necessary
[3:07] even family can be a hot button topic
[3:10] politically in different ways but
[3:11] there's a hidden glory of the family
[3:12] that i want to explore
[3:14] and so my proposition tonight is that
[3:16] children are the glory of the family so
[3:18] i'm just i'm proposing that to you that
[3:21] children are the glory of the family and
[3:23] it being a proposition you can make up
[3:25] your mind in your hearts just exactly
[3:27] what that means or even if that's true
[3:29] but i would say that children are the
[3:31] family's gold it's a treasure of the
[3:34] family something very precious
[3:36] and the
[3:37] uh
[3:38] the limit that i'd want to place on that
[3:40] or something to take into consideration
[3:42] so that you don't take it too far
[3:43] outside of its bounds or the caveat as
[3:45] we have it listed here is this is a this
[3:48] is not the basis for per uh parenting
[3:50] from the point of pride or selfishness
[3:52] to where we think well we want to do
[3:54] everything vicariously through our
[3:56] children or we're constantly trying to
[3:58] force our children when we talked last
[4:00] year about no filter i think that was
[4:01] something that we emphasized quite a bit
[4:03] is that we don't want our children to
[4:05] live a life
[4:06] and live life in such a way to we feel
[4:08] it reflects good on us as parents what
[4:10] we should want is the best for our
[4:12] children and in desiring that know that
[4:16] at the end of the day that's what's
[4:17] going to give us the greatest
[4:17] satisfaction the bible says we there's
[4:19] no greater joy than to see our children
[4:21] walking in truth
[4:22] and and children walking in truth may
[4:25] not give you the political or social
[4:26] clout that you want
[4:28] even within a church
[4:30] right so it's not it's not this
[4:32] acceptance or feeling important and not
[4:34] that kind of gold where everybody thinks
[4:35] you're rich but it's in a real true way
[4:38] so the the disclaimer on that is we're
[4:40] not not mentioning children as being
[4:42] gold
[4:43] and the
[4:44] digging for gold and something selfish
[4:46] that you want to get out of your
[4:47] children the bible says in proverbs
[4:49] chapter 22 verse 6
[4:51] train up a child in the way he should go
[4:54] and when he is old he will not depart
[4:56] from it
[4:58] i can still remember
[5:00] one of the first times i
[5:01] remember a minister really breaking this
[5:03] down it was brother tom for the tom ray
[5:05] ministering on it and expounding upon
[5:07] what this meant
[5:09] and to train up a child in a way he
[5:11] should go it
[5:13] uh
[5:14] leaves it's a principle maybe that begs
[5:16] a lot of questioning like well what does
[5:18] that mean
[5:19] what is the way that he should go but
[5:21] then it gives us principle and when he
[5:22] is old he will not easily depart from it
[5:24] this is something that has a guiding
[5:26] power upon the child and it's a
[5:28] principle that we've we've all heard
[5:29] this before right i mean this is a
[5:31] scripture that parents really really
[5:32] hold on to maybe his children oh yeah
[5:34] yeah i've heard it but one day if the
[5:35] lord tears you but yeah i believe it
[5:38] because it'll mean more to you
[5:40] but the way he should go even this
[5:41] phrase train up a child i think that has
[5:43] a particular meaning and emphasis that
[5:45] we can amplify in the way he should go
[5:48] that phrase is often misunderstood
[5:51] because we think uh train up a child and
[5:53] this is the way we probably process in
[5:54] the way that we think he should go
[5:56] straight up a child in what we think he
[5:58] ought to do but even the way the wording
[6:01] is used in the hebrew it's not our way
[6:04] but train up a child in his way
[6:06] so there's a there's a sensitivity and
[6:08] understanding even that there's a way
[6:10] that we want to train up a child to
[6:12] where we're training him up and raising
[6:13] him up
[6:15] i just want to be sure that i i'm going
[6:17] to be coming back to this scripture and
[6:18] i want to be sure that i i leave it
[6:20] right where i want it to be
[6:22] that there's a way that we train up the
[6:23] child that's peculiar to that child
[6:26] but and not necessarily our opinion or
[6:29] what we would desire
[6:31] i could have the desire as a father say
[6:32] well i have a i have a law practice that
[6:34] i could pass down to my sons and sons
[6:36] you need to be lawyers this is a
[6:37] tremendous opportunity for you and that
[6:39] could be my desire but there has to be a
[6:41] sensitivity that to train him up in the
[6:43] way that he should go
[6:45] that's different from the desire i might
[6:47] have naturally see my son accomplish
[6:49] something
[6:50] and that's where i think maybe we
[6:52] address that caveat this is nothing
[6:54] selfish from the point of parenting or
[6:56] any kind of negative pride or bad pride
[7:00] now this may seem to be kind of a huge
[7:02] leap from that but now that we've kind
[7:04] of established that kids eat free
[7:06] and tonight we're preaching about
[7:07] digging for gold and we've established
[7:09] that in mark chapter 1 verse 1 it says
[7:11] the beginning of the gospel of jesus
[7:13] christ the son of god this fits in very
[7:15] well these next several moments will fit
[7:17] in very well with the subject matter we
[7:20] opened up on sunday on i am an open book
[7:23] and i want to explore the things about
[7:25] jesus christ and so maybe this is just
[7:27] helping me a little bit by sharing some
[7:29] of these things now but mark writes it
[7:31] this way the beginning of the gospel of
[7:32] jesus christ describing him as we all
[7:34] believe the son of god we realize
[7:37] we use the language let's ponder a
[7:39] little bit more deeply tonight jesus
[7:40] christ was or is the son of god
[7:43] and the bible clearly and over and over
[7:46] again
[7:46] and jesus himself using this language
[7:49] quite often of expressing this
[7:51] relationship of the father and the son
[7:54] and the new testament it constantly
[7:55] expresses it this way and this is a
[7:57] dynamic that's very unique to the new
[7:59] testament
[8:00] because the the children of israel
[8:03] viewed abraham as their father and the
[8:05] god they worshipped as the god of their
[8:07] fathers
[8:08] and now jesus begins to use a language
[8:09] that's very unique and he's saying here
[8:11] here am i is what you believe to be a
[8:13] mortal man who has a relationship to god
[8:16] the god of abraham i have a relationship
[8:18] to him as a son which is not even a
[8:20] relationship that abraham shared
[8:23] and so for god to choose and i want you
[8:25] to recognize this is god's desire for
[8:27] god to choose this exact expression of
[8:30] the messiah and and savior since those
[8:33] are two distinct offices to the
[8:35] expression i say offices the jews
[8:37] believe in a messiah or an anointed one
[8:39] the concept of a savior wasn't ex wasn't
[8:41] exactly very clear to them but for god
[8:44] to choose the expression of sonship in
[8:46] the messiah and the savior was very
[8:47] unexpected
[8:49] and we looked at this on sunday in john
[8:50] chapter 5 verses 17 and 18 it says but
[8:53] jesus answered them my father worketh
[8:55] here the two and i work he's doing
[8:58] something on a sabbath this is against
[8:59] the law this is worthy of stoning
[9:02] and he says my father works so i work
[9:05] and this is jesus now they knew exactly
[9:07] what he was saying when he said my
[9:08] father they didn't go well joseph's not
[9:10] here he doesn't work on saturdays they
[9:12] knew he was talking about god the i am
[9:14] so therefore the jews sought the more to
[9:16] kill him because he not only had broken
[9:18] the sabbath but said also that god was
[9:20] his father and this is what was in this
[9:23] is clearly what is understood by the
[9:25] jews when jesus says that god was his
[9:27] father making himself equal with god
[9:31] so this is there's a there was a
[9:32] reverence an honor a a pride a treasure
[9:37] embodied in a father-son relationship a
[9:39] parent to child to the jews
[9:42] and so when he said that the the god
[9:44] elohim jehovah was his father
[9:46] that they immediately began to relate to
[9:48] how important that would have been in
[9:50] their law and in their history and their
[9:51] structure think of they're called the
[9:53] children of israel just think how
[9:55] tightly they were bound to familiar
[9:57] relationship and bloodline
[9:59] like none of us call ourselves children
[10:01] of the name of our great great great
[10:03] great great great great grandpa right we
[10:05] don't we just don't do it
[10:06] and so but to them they were identified
[10:09] and measured by these relationships and
[10:11] by their fathers the god of our fathers
[10:13] the god of our fathers
[10:15] and to a jew when he says that he refers
[10:17] to the father my father works here too
[10:20] and the son works here
[10:22] to a jew even the word son which would
[10:24] be ben
[10:26] it means it comes from the word bana
[10:28] which means to build or continue
[10:30] and this so this is what even the word
[10:32] sun kind of assumes we think sun
[10:34] and we immediately say oh it's just a
[10:36] child
[10:37] of a of a parent it's a son is the male
[10:39] offspring of a mom a son is a male
[10:41] offspring of a father but it meant more
[10:44] for this in this word sun which would be
[10:46] ben it's the builder of the family name
[10:49] and for this the word that's used that
[10:51] was attached to the sun initially is the
[10:54] sun is the multiplication of the father
[10:57] and that's what god intended in the
[10:58] beginning that's why he gave the woman
[11:00] to the man was to multiply the man so a
[11:04] son is a duplication or a multiplication
[11:07] of the father
[11:08] and so in the scripture you could have
[11:10] been ben and i or ben haddad and it's
[11:13] the son of it could be written away son
[11:15] of my sorrow the son of haddad and so
[11:18] ben is the son of so if you think of
[11:20] being to use even the name benjamin it's
[11:23] to denote that this is something that
[11:25] comes from the parent
[11:27] so it's always related to the parent in
[11:30] the new testament simon barjona what is
[11:32] that simon son of jonah so he actually
[11:36] is identified by his father in his name
[11:40] because that's what a son represents he
[11:41] represents uh the father
[11:44] he's a multiplication of the father to
[11:47] the point to where now he says my father
[11:49] works and i work and they immediately
[11:50] say well then if you're saying that god
[11:52] is your father you've made yourself
[11:54] equal to god because that's what a son
[11:56] is
[11:56] that's his position his calling is to
[11:58] ultimately assume that place as the
[12:01] family the builder and the progenitor of
[12:03] the family name and even the legacy then
[12:06] of that name
[12:07] so it's upon this basis that jesus
[12:09] declared the father i come in my
[12:11] father's name multiple times he
[12:13] references the father and as the son he
[12:16] manifests the father's glory
[12:19] this is what is mentioned quite often in
[12:21] the scripture in john chapter 1 verse 14
[12:24] it says in the word was made flesh and
[12:25] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[12:28] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[12:30] father
[12:32] no other man could claim that title at
[12:34] that time as being the only one that god
[12:38] has fathered
[12:39] the only man born of a woman that came
[12:41] from god came from the process of the
[12:43] word of god forming itself in the womb
[12:45] of a virgin and being brought forth as
[12:47] the only begotten son of god and now the
[12:50] word made flesh in jesus christ they're
[12:53] beholding his glory but not just the
[12:56] glory of jesus the son of joseph in the
[12:58] natural or jesus the man of galilee but
[13:01] the glory of the father
[13:03] is expressed in him
[13:05] and if that's not clear you could see
[13:07] how paul brings it back in second
[13:09] corinthians chapter four
[13:10] verses five and six for we preach not
[13:12] ourselves but christ jesus the lord and
[13:15] ourselves your servants for jesus sake
[13:17] for god who commanded the light to shine
[13:19] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[13:22] to give the light of the knowledge of
[13:24] the glory of god in the face of jesus
[13:27] christ
[13:28] so where is the knowledge of the glory
[13:30] of god in the face of jesus christ it is
[13:32] the face of jesus christ that we behold
[13:35] that declares to us and manifest to us
[13:37] the glory of god this is a familiar
[13:40] refrain to a jew because they they knew
[13:42] that when moses had met god on the
[13:44] mountain top his face
[13:46] was shining with this glow with this
[13:47] countenance having met the glory of god
[13:49] and they had to veil his face well that
[13:52] which was symbolized and represented in
[13:53] moses is made perfect in christ that
[13:56] it's through jesus christ you know the
[13:59] glory of god
[14:01] the light to give the light of the
[14:02] knowledge of the glory of god on the
[14:04] face of jesus christ why the son is the
[14:06] glory of the father
[14:08] christ is the manifestation of the glory
[14:10] of god as his image as his expression
[14:13] philip said show us the father and the
[14:15] sight suffice he says have i been so
[14:17] long with you that you don't know who i
[14:18] am when you've seen me you've seen
[14:21] the father
[14:23] now we realized that in the literal
[14:24] sense if we tried to kind of get very
[14:26] literal on that
[14:28] uh
[14:29] and and try to
[14:30] make it in a literal sense we realize
[14:32] that he's saying that whatever god is in
[14:34] the invisible sense as this elohim this
[14:36] invisible god he is now tangible he's
[14:39] now expressed in me
[14:41] this there's a there's a glory of god
[14:43] that's being expressed hebrews 1 2 and 3
[14:45] and i know i'm taking some time
[14:47] to do this but i think these are
[14:48] important things to be very fresh in our
[14:50] minds
[14:51] he says
[14:53] hath in these god have
[14:54] by pastimes spoken by the prophets but
[14:56] hath in these last days spoken us by his
[14:58] son whom he hath appointed air of all
[15:01] things by whom also he made the worlds
[15:04] who being the brightness of his glory in
[15:06] the express image of his person and
[15:09] upholding all things by the word of his
[15:10] power when he had by himself purged our
[15:12] sin sat down on the right hand of the
[15:14] majesty on high
[15:19] all these scriptures are showing us
[15:21] that jesus as the son of god was
[15:23] declaring the glory of god
[15:25] his grandeur his majesty his character
[15:27] his attributes what he is you could know
[15:30] through jesus christ
[15:32] and this is then it's a very important
[15:34] relationship that god wants to establish
[15:36] because again just kind of backing up on
[15:38] in one sense the messiah could come as a
[15:41] natural man and and come as one who is
[15:43] born of a woman but yet uh according to
[15:46] all these different prophecies
[15:48] and and the jews would have received a
[15:50] man of that
[15:51] of that caliber of that stature and
[15:54] there's ones that the jews believe that
[15:55] lived natural lives and led the people
[15:58] and did certain things that were very
[15:59] very close to what a messiah should have
[16:01] been but yet didn't fully fulfill all
[16:03] the prophecies and they believed that
[16:05] those natural men were more like more of
[16:08] a messiah than christ was whom we
[16:10] believe to have come straight from god
[16:12] because they don't they don't see it
[16:14] that way but god wanted it to be a man
[16:17] he wanted it to be if we could say a son
[16:19] of man
[16:20] but he want he wanted to establish a
[16:22] relationship between himself
[16:25] the deity the divine and humanity
[16:29] he wanted to establish a relationship so
[16:31] that through that we could begin to
[16:33] understand ourselves and understand the
[16:35] relationship that he wants us to have
[16:37] with god
[16:38] so the son manifested and declared the
[16:40] father's glory we could say the son of
[16:42] man was the glory of god
[16:45] the only way that god could truly be
[16:46] made flesh is in his son
[16:49] brother branham in the message christ is
[16:50] the mystery god revealed he says but
[16:52] what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood
[16:55] for he was a father this is an essential
[16:57] characteristic of god he is a father
[16:59] parenthood originated in god brother
[17:01] abraham says
[17:02] and so he loved parenthood he loved
[17:04] fatherhood he was a father but the only
[17:06] way he could express it
[17:08] the only way he could express fatherhood
[17:10] was to become a son of man
[17:13] so if god is going to be a father he had
[17:15] to become a son
[17:16] if god is going to be a husband
[17:19] he has to become a bride
[17:20] right we understand these principles so
[17:23] consider this principle this father-son
[17:25] relationship and what it expresses for
[17:27] us if there's a principle if there's a
[17:29] reflection of something that god wants
[17:30] us to gather from it let's ponder this
[17:33] ephesians chapter 5 verse 1 it says be
[17:35] therefore followers of god as dear
[17:38] children
[17:40] now there's a commandment that we ought
[17:42] to follow god as children would follow
[17:45] their fathers
[17:47] a child
[17:49] inherits its nature from
[17:52] its parents
[17:54] and that i think it's very obvious and
[17:56] having got through maybe the foundation
[17:57] part i don't know if i'm going to slow
[17:58] down a little bit i just felt like i
[18:00] have to get that part in
[18:01] and maybe i'm very preachy tonight but a
[18:04] child inherits its nature from its
[18:06] parents
[18:07] so without any effort
[18:09] it imitates
[18:11] it it doesn't even have to try you say
[18:13] well there's certain instincts they have
[18:15] in them that are just inherent in
[18:17] they've inherited them they're in their
[18:18] gen their dna it's their genetics and so
[18:22] without any effort they can mimic their
[18:23] parents a son will mimic the father a
[18:25] daughter will mimic the mom and there'll
[18:27] be certain attributes and traits that
[18:29] children exhibit like oh that's just
[18:31] like their dad or that's just like their
[18:32] mom or that's just like me or that's
[18:34] just like you it's in them by nature
[18:37] now that that can it probably scares a
[18:40] lot of us right like oh no because when
[18:43] you're born again by the new birth you
[18:45] receive a new nature but for some reason
[18:47] god did not allow the new nature to pass
[18:50] genetically whenever you have children
[18:52] it follows your old nature
[18:55] unfortunately so think about this you're
[18:57] born in sin you're shaped in iniquity
[18:59] you know the life you live to the point
[19:00] that you got born again but you get born
[19:02] again you're filled with the holy ghost
[19:03] and then you get married and you have
[19:04] children because that's the proper order
[19:06] and then now having children you're like
[19:08] oh no they've got the nature i had
[19:10] before i was married before i had the
[19:12] holy ghost
[19:14] and then you realize that parenthood has
[19:16] a great the greatest power to influence
[19:19] and to shape the character of a child
[19:22] the single greatest power
[19:25] i know that there's a certain
[19:27] uh i know there's even a chinese proverb
[19:30] that men resemble their times more than
[19:31] their parents but we're not chinese
[19:34] and there's uh there's certain ideas
[19:36] that could be expressed that the
[19:38] children can be reflective of their
[19:39] generation and their school peers and
[19:41] things
[19:42] and that's if you let it
[19:45] that's if you let it
[19:46] but there's really no better way for a
[19:48] child to be influenced than by his
[19:49] parents
[19:51] and true parenthood is a calling
[19:53] it is an office
[19:55] think of how and we're just maybe touch
[19:57] on it very quickly god entrusted his own
[20:00] son to the care of parents
[20:02] so i'm going to send a savior i'm going
[20:04] to send the messiah i'm going to send
[20:05] him into the world he's going to be me
[20:06] replicated he's going to be bone of my
[20:08] bone he's going to be flesh of my flesh
[20:10] he's going to have my spirit without
[20:12] measure i'm going to pour myself into
[20:14] him but i'm going to from birth and
[20:16] trust him to a father and a mother
[20:20] and this is god wanting to reflect
[20:21] something very powerful to us
[20:24] so if we are parents then this
[20:26] responsibility matters
[20:29] and i would say it's responsibility that
[20:31] never ceases
[20:33] because it may be very easy for some to
[20:35] say well at this point brother aaron's
[20:37] talking about families talking about
[20:38] raising families my children are grown
[20:40] up then
[20:41] then that doesn't apply to me but really
[20:43] when do you when do you cease to become
[20:45] a parent
[20:47] you know by divorce you can cease to be
[20:49] a spouse
[20:51] but you'll never stop being a parent
[20:54] even when the child dies
[20:58] does it get serious all of a sudden
[21:00] ask anybody who's ever lost a child
[21:03] it's not like oh well they died so i'm
[21:04] not a mom anymore no they'll carry it
[21:06] with them as a mom
[21:08] their entire lives
[21:10] why because there's something so
[21:12] powerful about this office this
[21:14] responsibility matters so so
[21:16] tremendously
[21:17] and our manner of life in this calling
[21:20] how we conduct ourselves in this
[21:21] colonies of utmost importance
[21:24] in the message elisha the prophet
[21:25] brother braham says and how can you
[21:26] expect your children to go to sunday
[21:28] school and serve the lord when you
[21:30] yourself don't even go
[21:32] that's a pretty powerful statement isn't
[21:34] it
[21:36] so brother branham says you shouldn't
[21:37] send your kids to sunday school right
[21:39] you've heard that
[21:40] brother man said you shouldn't send your
[21:42] kids to sunday school
[21:43] he said you should take him
[21:45] and he's touching on this attitude where
[21:47] maybe you're expecting things of your
[21:49] children that they ought to do
[21:51] but how can you expect them to go to
[21:53] sunday school when you don't even go
[21:55] yourself
[21:57] right
[21:58] they i want them to be faithful i want
[22:00] to be persevered i want them to be
[22:01] church-going people i want them to honor
[22:03] the lord i want them to do this and to
[22:05] do that he said how could you expect
[22:06] them to do it if you don't do it
[22:07] yourself and he says this how can you
[22:09] expect your children to be something
[22:11] when you're nothing
[22:15] that's a heavy statement so that he he
[22:17] recognizes the heaviness i don't mean
[22:19] you wasn't nothing
[22:21] but i mean when you know that you make
[22:22] no profession
[22:24] when you know you're not this is brother
[22:26] aaron talking now when you know you're
[22:28] not doing something how can you expect
[22:31] your children to be that something
[22:34] hey i i'm going to step on everyone's
[22:36] toes but it's kind of like will you stop
[22:38] yelling
[22:39] right
[22:42] how do you expect them to stop yelling
[22:44] if that's all you do they're like okay
[22:46] yes mom
[22:49] there's a certain thing that's been
[22:50] reflected in conduct that children are
[22:52] naturally going to turn back around to
[22:53] you i said how can you expect something
[22:55] from them when you're not doing
[22:57] something yourself how can you expect
[22:59] your children to be righteous when
[23:01] you're putting such an example before
[23:04] them
[23:05] how can you do it you're the best
[23:07] example that they have
[23:10] they're going to look to you when they
[23:12] won't look for no one else because your
[23:14] nature is in them
[23:16] the example matters
[23:18] it's the example that in a lot of a lot
[23:21] of ways if you could i i have to just
[23:24] really rely on the holy spirit to maybe
[23:26] do with your hearts
[23:27] on to a deeper level
[23:30] but our parents took us to church
[23:33] took us to meetings
[23:35] put the word first
[23:36] sacrificed for years
[23:38] and then
[23:40] we have an experience with god
[23:43] we get the holy ghost and then we start
[23:45] we start doing those things by nature
[23:46] now by a new nature
[23:48] that our parents tried to demonstrate
[23:50] and expressed to us beforehand
[23:53] and let's not forget
[23:56] the positive things that were done
[23:59] that led to the place to where we could
[24:01] receive a baptismal holy ghost and go
[24:02] forward because if we're not if we're
[24:05] not doing if we don't do even the things
[24:07] our parents did
[24:09] then how can we expect better results
[24:14] all right
[24:16] to those on the radio the people are
[24:18] shaking their heads up and down
[24:19] vigorously
[24:21] to those who are
[24:22] tuning in by phone hookup
[24:25] and you can't see the the vigorous nods
[24:29] but the the people are agreeing think
[24:32] about that how humbling that can be
[24:34] that if a prior generation had it so
[24:37] hard
[24:38] and they met that they met that
[24:40] difficulty with a certain intensity and
[24:42] then this generation has it harder and
[24:44] we're not even meeting the intensity of
[24:45] the prior generation there's a
[24:47] tremendous imbalance that begins to take
[24:49] place
[24:50] something to consider
[24:52] so the
[24:53] the
[24:54] the children are to be
[24:56] followers we are told to be followers of
[24:58] god as dear children what i want you to
[25:00] recognize then as that god paul is
[25:03] referencing and even uses it later
[25:04] follow me as i follow god so that kind
[25:06] of is the right example
[25:08] if i'm your father in the gospel and i'm
[25:10] following the right thing there's no
[25:11] detriment in you following me
[25:13] right if it's the blind leaders of the
[25:15] blind or they all fall in the ditch but
[25:17] if you're following an enlightened
[25:19] leader if you're following one who knows
[25:20] the way and someone who knows the truth
[25:22] then even if you're blind the in the
[25:24] following you could come to the light
[25:26] you could come to sight because the the
[25:28] disciple would be as the master
[25:30] so there's this dynamic of then children
[25:32] then being predispositioned to mimic and
[25:34] imitate their parents
[25:37] that's a sobering thought
[25:39] and if they have your nature to begin
[25:42] with
[25:44] then they'd be better served by a
[25:45] different nurture
[25:48] right
[25:48] if
[25:49] if my sons have aaron mcgeary's nature
[25:52] by birth then what i would want to do is
[25:55] nurture them in the lord
[25:57] not in more aaron
[26:01] now
[26:02] in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 7
[26:05] as i've kind of amplifying how the son
[26:08] christ was the manifestation of the
[26:10] father's glory now think about this
[26:12] scripture
[26:13] for indeed for a man indeed ought not to
[26:15] cover his head
[26:17] for as much as he is the image and glory
[26:20] of god and the woman is the glory of the
[26:24] man
[26:25] now this is
[26:27] a
[26:28] familiar scripture
[26:32] but i'm just going to walk through it
[26:33] the man is
[26:35] the image and glory of god so the man
[26:37] reflects the glory the majesty the
[26:39] excellence of god
[26:41] we say in his original state man in his
[26:43] original state represented god's glory
[26:45] represented god's perfection that's what
[26:47] he was to be on earth as a god having
[26:49] dominion and power this was all
[26:52] reflected in the office of manhood when
[26:55] god made men
[26:56] and therefore manhood retains this image
[27:00] even still now as we talked about it
[27:02] last wednesday god is the good that
[27:04] there's still an element of deity in the
[27:06] divine a shadow that still shocks
[27:08] mankind to this day and it's when
[27:10] someone does really good it shocks us
[27:12] right
[27:13] because that if there's good it has to
[27:15] be god that has to be something divine
[27:17] and so man even still today holds an
[27:19] office or position that is reflective of
[27:22] god's nature it's the place that god has
[27:24] put him in the scripture and where what
[27:26] the office that he holds
[27:28] now as the bible is saying the man is in
[27:30] the image of god it says but the woman
[27:32] is the glory of the man
[27:33] so likewise the woman is intended to be
[27:36] an expression of man's glory
[27:38] that the man coming from god and being
[27:41] in the image of god is reflective of
[27:43] god's glory now the woman coming from
[27:45] the man she becomes a reflection of the
[27:47] man's glory but remember kind of the
[27:50] order at the order of that ascending she
[27:53] is now an expression of man's glory
[27:55] she's a reflection of his majesty his
[27:57] honor because she's come from the man
[28:00] and and i don't i i'd love to maybe
[28:03] express this and amplify this to greater
[28:04] detail but the woman represents a man's
[28:06] character
[28:08] if she is the woman who has come out
[28:10] from the man or she's the woman that is
[28:12] joined to the man she represents his
[28:14] judgment his opinion the woman is if i
[28:17] can say that she is the opinion of the
[28:19] man
[28:21] now that means that if and we're looking
[28:23] at a man and a woman is man and wife in
[28:25] that relationship the man is in the
[28:27] image of god and therefore he represents
[28:29] the glory of the father but now in the
[28:32] marriage the woman represents and is
[28:34] expressive of the glory of the man
[28:36] because she reflects his opinion
[28:38] she is his opinion so he's saying
[28:41] his opinion of this woman is that she's
[28:43] worthy to be a wife she's beautiful
[28:45] she's someone that i have i want to have
[28:47] so she represents his opinion but then
[28:49] also
[28:50] others can look at the woman and by
[28:52] looking at the woman derive some
[28:54] assessment about the man
[28:57] i don't know if i shared this with you
[28:58] but uh last election psych when i was
[29:00] getting some quotes from very close
[29:01] friends of mine saying that they
[29:03] believed that kamala harris fulfilled
[29:04] the prophecy of this woman rising up to
[29:07] power in the united states and kind of
[29:08] just jokingly cuz i i said well the only
[29:10] thing that tells me is you think she's
[29:12] beautiful
[29:14] and and that was their opinion of her
[29:16] and i didn't hear from him for a while
[29:18] so i had to text back and say hey hey
[29:21] i was kind of joking
[29:22] uh but the uh
[29:24] it's it's reflective of his opinion a
[29:26] man's opinion that if this is he
[29:28] believes that she is a quality woman to
[29:30] marry she says something about what he
[29:32] desires and what his expectations are
[29:34] and if you looked at her and said she
[29:35] has no desire to have children she has
[29:37] no desire to keep home or she has no
[29:38] desire to be a christian she has no
[29:40] desire to act
[29:42] with integrity or honesty then you would
[29:43] say that man it must not matter to him
[29:46] it must not have mattered to him at all
[29:48] to marry a woman that would be a
[29:49] compliment the bible says in proverbs 12
[29:51] 4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her
[29:53] husband
[29:54] she is the coronation of his office the
[29:56] coronation of his title she is a crown
[29:58] to her husband that to think of the
[30:00] crowning moment for man is this woman
[30:03] that he marries
[30:04] but she that maketh ashamed is rottnest
[30:06] in his bones now why why would she be
[30:09] rockness in his bones it's only the
[30:11] power to corrupt is only as great as it
[30:13] is because of the power she has to crown
[30:17] if she had no power to corrupt there'd
[30:19] be no crown
[30:20] but because a a woman that makes a shame
[30:22] is rottnest in his bones the the fact
[30:24] that she has power to corrupt by the
[30:26] reverse she has power to crown
[30:29] and we're familiar with this principle
[30:31] in choosing of a bride there's a lot of
[30:32] statements that fit this the kind of a
[30:33] woman that a man would choose will
[30:35] reflect his ambition and his character
[30:39] the kind of man that a woman uh the
[30:41] woman is chosen by man when a man
[30:43] chooses a woman
[30:44] that ma that woman that he chooses
[30:47] reflects something about what's on the
[30:48] inside of them
[30:51] as we expressed it before
[30:53] there's something hidden about the man
[30:55] that's not revealed until he chooses a
[30:57] wife
[30:59] there's a
[31:01] this is uh
[31:04] well there's things that begin to rush
[31:06] into my heart that i'm thinking about
[31:07] even personally
[31:09] but there might be things that you
[31:11] recognize and you see
[31:13] and you may you could speculate at say
[31:15] well i'm not sure i don't know but then
[31:17] the choosing of a wife reveals a lot
[31:20] and brother batman even says that a man
[31:22] that when a man chooses a wife it says
[31:24] something about his future home
[31:26] and what he wants his home to be even
[31:28] though it does not yet exist
[31:30] it reveals the character of his heart
[31:33] and what he wants to achieve and that's
[31:34] why the bride is the new jerusalem
[31:37] previewed
[31:38] revealed beforehand because he chooses
[31:40] the bride to be wife and she reflects
[31:42] the future home
[31:43] of what he wants his home to be so there
[31:46] is a glory of the man
[31:50] which is reflective of the father
[31:52] and then you have the woman who is the
[31:54] glory of the man and now
[31:56] in this chain of glory
[31:59] it's it's not that it drops off
[32:03] this is the the man is in the image of
[32:04] god and therefore he represents the
[32:06] glory of god but now the woman is the
[32:07] glory of the husband and so in that
[32:09] image i want to ask you what about the
[32:11] children that are the product of that
[32:13] union
[32:14] if the man is the glory of god and the
[32:16] woman is the glory of the man there has
[32:18] to be some
[32:19] a equals b e well c
[32:21] a equals c going on there somehow right
[32:24] just in the there has to be some
[32:26] continuity of what the woman is
[32:28] represented when she represents the
[32:30] character of a man
[32:32] so if this is true of the man and the
[32:33] woman what about the children
[32:36] what about the whole
[32:39] as i think the saying is and there's a
[32:41] tremendous debate as to where it
[32:42] originates but the the whole is not just
[32:45] the sum of the parts
[32:47] that there's something greater that
[32:48] comes out of
[32:50] when the when the parts come together
[32:53] that you can't just look at you can't
[32:54] just look at all the ingredients of
[32:56] bread and say well
[32:57] there they are
[32:59] they they make bread but once it comes
[33:02] together in the right way
[33:04] the whole is greater than the sum of the
[33:06] parts
[33:07] i know i've kind of ventured into
[33:08] philosophy and some of you are either
[33:10] really liking it or you're wincing
[33:12] but i want you to ponder that in a
[33:14] family take a man all right you got the
[33:16] man you got the woman okay you got the
[33:17] woman and you got the children okay
[33:18] you've got them well you've got them
[33:20] let's just put them together and add
[33:21] them together well no that's not quite
[33:23] going to be enough what about when
[33:25] they're made when they're together
[33:27] when they when they're they become whole
[33:29] and it's the whole is greater than the
[33:31] sum of its parts it's something that god
[33:34] wants to reflect the man maybe he has a
[33:36] glory on his own but the man when he's
[33:38] joined to the woman there's some
[33:39] multiplication of that glory because now
[33:41] the woman is the glory of the man i'm
[33:43] saying then what about the children
[33:45] in psalms 127 verses 3 to 5 lo children
[33:49] are in heritage of the lord
[33:51] this is what
[33:52] children are they're a heritage of the
[33:54] lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[33:56] reward
[33:58] that's why i have a saying you can't
[34:00] lose when you have kids
[34:02] i've been asked the question before
[34:04] do you know if you're having a boy or a
[34:05] girl and i'm like yeah
[34:08] is there a third option
[34:10] yeah we're having a boy or a girl
[34:12] and they don't necessarily appreciate my
[34:14] sarcasm
[34:15] but either way you can't lose boy or
[34:17] girl you can't lose as arrows are in the
[34:19] hand of a mighty man so are children of
[34:22] the youth of youth happy is the man that
[34:25] hath his quiver full of them that's five
[34:28] brother travis five
[34:30] five not three five happiest man has
[34:33] this quiver full
[34:34] they shall not be ashamed but they the
[34:37] children speak with the enemies in the
[34:38] gate
[34:39] a man who has five children
[34:42] and i believe that a quiver would be
[34:43] five so a man who has many children is
[34:45] quiver full he's got these children of
[34:47] strength and vitality he will
[34:50] they will not be ashamed nor would the
[34:52] parents be ashamed but he has defenders
[34:54] protectors those that will will stand
[34:57] together shoulder to shoulder to speak
[34:58] against the enemies in the gate and so
[35:00] the word of god is validating
[35:02] this sense of the preciousness and the
[35:04] value of children
[35:06] children are a heritage an inheritance
[35:09] given to you if you have if you know
[35:11] someone that has children if you're one
[35:13] that has children yourself then there's
[35:15] a there's an acknowledgement to god i
[35:17] say saved or unsafe there's an
[35:18] acknowledgement to god that children are
[35:20] a gift from god
[35:24] and there's so much that could be said
[35:26] in that vein
[35:28] but consider then the glory that our
[35:29] children represent
[35:32] do we fully appreciate
[35:34] and and recognize the value of their
[35:37] worth
[35:40] i don't ask that in a rhetorical manner
[35:42] that you don't i'm just asking
[35:44] do you feel that you do
[35:47] brother branham in the message it wasn't
[35:48] so from the beginning it's the first
[35:50] place i found where he's making this
[35:51] direct statement but he says that a
[35:54] brother said to omnipotence me he said i
[35:56] have to write that down or the way that
[35:57] he references it it's like he had heard
[35:59] it and he says he says the two opposite
[36:01] impotence mean i wrote that down he says
[36:02] when god and a believer meets there's
[36:05] two omnipotents
[36:06] so
[36:07] god and a believer a believer is an
[36:09] omnipotent god is a nominee because a
[36:11] man is a part of god he is a son of god
[36:14] and what little he is joins with the
[36:16] entire body
[36:18] so in a couple other places where he
[36:19] references two omnipotence meetings he
[36:21] says something's got to shake
[36:23] he talks about how it creates a power
[36:26] why because god is an omnipotent and a
[36:28] believer is an omnipotent
[36:30] now i'm wanting you to think now as
[36:32] spiritual minded sons and daughters of
[36:34] god then that if i am a son of god and i
[36:37] marry a daughter of god and if me as a
[36:40] son of god meeting god is to omnipotence
[36:43] meeting because i'm a part of god then
[36:45] there must be something on some level
[36:48] somehow of an omnipotent joining
[36:50] together with an omnipotent when a
[36:52] believing man and a believing woman come
[36:54] together
[36:55] you begin to recognize how there may be
[36:57] a higher order to not being unequally
[36:59] yoked
[37:00] it may not be because your soul will be
[37:02] sent to hell but just think about the
[37:04] power that is resident in a family when
[37:06] a believing man and a believing woman
[37:08] are joined together in holy matrimony
[37:10] there's two omnipotence meeting in a
[37:12] promise
[37:14] he says it'll shake something
[37:16] something's got to shake it creates a
[37:17] power
[37:18] and think of all the instances where
[37:19] jesus is two or three two or three two
[37:21] or three
[37:23] and he even says if two will agree is it
[37:25] touching anything
[37:26] why it's it's those omnipotence
[37:29] meeting
[37:30] what does it say in mark chapter 10
[37:32] verses six to nine i'll just skip to
[37:34] verse nine is it saying the two shall be
[37:35] one flesh when a man shall leave his
[37:37] father and mother in the beginning god
[37:39] created a male and female and when a man
[37:41] leaves his father and mother and cleaves
[37:42] to his wife there'll be one flesh not no
[37:44] more two but one flesh verse nine what
[37:46] therefore god hath joined together let
[37:49] no man put us under two omnipotents
[37:52] being joined together under a covenant
[37:55] marriage is in the covenant
[37:57] parenthood is joined with the covenant
[38:02] and i say children as that was my
[38:04] proposition children are the glory of
[38:06] the family
[38:08] i would say that children may often be
[38:10] the unrecognized or the hidden glory of
[38:13] this union of god
[38:16] because in there is in the in timothy
[38:20] it talks about how the woman shall be
[38:21] saved in childbearing
[38:24] brother branham if she continues in the
[38:26] in these things he makes a statement in
[38:28] marriage and divorce it's very unique
[38:31] and he says and remember she being a
[38:33] part of a man the bible said she
[38:34] nevertheless has suffered not a woman to
[38:36] teach or to usurp authority
[38:38] any authority but to be in silence for
[38:39] adam was first formed then eve and adam
[38:41] was not deceived but the byproduct was
[38:43] deceived
[38:45] notwithstanding she shall be saved as
[38:46] she continues in holiness and sobriety
[38:48] and in childbearing and all such
[38:50] because then
[38:52] she becomes a part of this man
[38:55] you notice that
[38:56] because then she becomes a part of this
[38:58] man
[38:59] there is this this recognition
[39:01] in two instances in the word of god
[39:03] where
[39:04] brother branham kind of uses this to
[39:06] make the point not that there was some
[39:08] maybe literal uh
[39:11] some way that god had the option but he
[39:13] uses this to make the point
[39:15] that
[39:16] when adam took the woman
[39:19] and she was burying holding his son
[39:23] that god couldn't judge her because a
[39:24] part of the man was in her
[39:27] and then when it came to sarah he uses a
[39:29] very interesting take on it that when
[39:31] sarah laughs god couldn't judge her
[39:34] because she was going to be the one to
[39:36] whom the promise came
[39:38] so she's joined she's joined with the
[39:40] man and therefore she's part of the
[39:41] covenant but then once conception and
[39:44] birth takes place it's in the child that
[39:47] they've truly literally become one flesh
[39:52] it's like people i've said this a lot
[39:54] with my wife they say well who do you
[39:56] think
[39:57] i think maybe has asked the question who
[39:58] do you think your children are gonna
[39:59] look like or what are your children look
[40:00] like i said they're gonna look like what
[40:02] children will look like if aaron and
[40:03] elizabeth have a child
[40:06] and oh he looks like his dad yeah
[40:08] because that's his dad oh he looks like
[40:09] his mom yeah because that's his mom
[40:11] right
[40:12] it's a mixture it's a blending together
[40:15] there's actually now been a union and
[40:17] even this natural birth god gets the
[40:20] credit for it even brother man said the
[40:21] natural birth is more supernatural
[40:24] and you kind of figure that out but in
[40:26] that way that god brings this life
[40:29] together and this life comes forth and
[40:31] in looking at this life that is in that
[40:33] there has been a union of the dna there
[40:36] has been a joining together of father
[40:38] gene and mother jeans coming together
[40:40] and recreating and producing that child
[40:42] and brother man makes this statement
[40:44] that through child bearing then she
[40:46] becomes what an indivisible
[40:49] part of the man
[40:51] forever joined together with the man
[40:53] because now there's a product of their
[40:54] union that is the man and the woman now
[40:57] joined and being reflected out and he
[40:59] said then she becomes a part of the man
[41:01] what god hath joined together it cannot
[41:04] be divided in that child and i'm just
[41:07] saying to you with a very heavy heart
[41:10] that we must be thinking very
[41:11] spiritually very deeply very maturely
[41:14] about these things these are not things
[41:17] that are the property of dr dobson these
[41:19] are not the things that are the
[41:20] properties of men and their psychologies
[41:23] and their approach to families this is
[41:25] something divine this is something
[41:27] precious this is something that we've
[41:30] got to get right before we get out of
[41:32] here
[41:34] because it's it's the glory of the union
[41:39] even to use the language that at the
[41:40] opening of the seals the full word is
[41:42] going to be born into manifestation
[41:46] implies that the product of the union
[41:49] is the glory of the union
[41:52] in proverbs 22 6 we're coming back to
[41:54] this
[41:55] i'm not just starting over in my notes
[41:57] because it's only 8 13 i'm coming back
[41:58] to it
[42:00] proverbs chapter 22 verse 6 train up a
[42:02] child in the way he should go
[42:05] and when he is old he'll not depart from
[42:07] it
[42:08] initiate the child
[42:10] at the opening of his path
[42:13] inspire him
[42:15] motivate him at the opening of his path
[42:19] remember his path his way her way
[42:21] her path
[42:25] if i could say this and i hope that you
[42:26] can ponder this very deeply now and
[42:28] concentrate
[42:30] that in the natural
[42:33] there are
[42:34] hundreds
[42:36] of successful paths
[42:39] i know brother lucas might want us to
[42:40] think that all we should ever be are
[42:41] programmers
[42:43] but we all can't be programmers
[42:44] otherwise you'd programmers would have
[42:46] nobody to program for and you get paid
[42:48] bucks an hour
[42:49] but uh that's not that's not an argument
[42:52] to brother lucas but we can't all do
[42:54] that right
[42:56] and to that point brother lucas has a
[42:58] process to kind of find those who can be
[43:01] programmers
[43:02] because not everybody can program it's
[43:04] not everyone can cook right
[43:07] this isn't a disney movie or whatever
[43:08] that was there's things that some people
[43:11] are better predisposed to there's things
[43:13] that people enjoy and they like and even
[43:15] within the
[43:16] the world of coding and i'm getting way
[43:18] outside of my uh expertise is there's
[43:20] many different paths within that that
[43:22] you can be
[43:23] and some are better suited for different
[43:25] things and this is i want you to
[43:26] consider this that when it comes to
[43:28] natural things there's a lot of
[43:31] successful paths you can take oh this
[43:33] person is in this line of work and this
[43:34] person does this and this person does
[43:36] that and this person got their degree
[43:38] and this person got this trade
[43:39] certificate this person does this this
[43:41] person owns this business and there's
[43:43] hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of
[43:44] different jobs that we could have and
[43:46] call that we have and in that be
[43:48] successful and i want you to think of
[43:50] how remarkable this is we can have
[43:51] different ethnicities different cultural
[43:53] backgrounds different social economic
[43:55] statuses we can all have different jobs
[43:57] and we can all have so many varieties of
[43:59] taste and likes and desires and
[44:01] inclinations and all of that be be
[44:04] successful and be fine and be uh and be
[44:07] good
[44:08] but when it comes to the word of god we
[44:10] all take the same path
[44:12] now just scratch your head on that for a
[44:14] while
[44:14] think about that that god designed a
[44:16] word so beautiful and so perfect that it
[44:19] could take people from different
[44:20] ethnicities cultures we all have
[44:22] different experiences different
[44:24] backgrounds things that we've gone
[44:25] through losses hurts things that we've
[44:27] gained and been added to us but yet the
[44:29] word of god could somehow on some level
[44:31] be applicable to all of us
[44:34] and though there may be thousands of
[44:36] ways that we could be successfully
[44:38] naturally there's only one path we can
[44:40] take and be successful spiritually
[44:43] and so when it comes to the path that we
[44:45] should go we're initiating the opening
[44:48] of the child's path we need to consider
[44:50] how much that relates to the spiritual
[44:52] part and not so much the natural part
[45:00] if you train him up in the way that he
[45:01] should go when he's old he will not
[45:02] depart from it
[45:04] there is a spiritual success that we
[45:06] ought to desire for our children
[45:08] this is the one i believe that i'm
[45:10] probably the most
[45:11] uh and the most fervent of tonight as i
[45:14] speak this is it's a recognition of the
[45:16] value that our children hold
[45:19] in proverbs chapter 19 verses 26 to 27
[45:23] he that wasteth his father and chaseth
[45:25] away his mother
[45:27] is a son that causeth shame
[45:29] and bringeth
[45:30] reproach these are very heavy words
[45:33] cease my son to hear the instruction
[45:35] that causeth to air from the words of
[45:37] knowledge
[45:39] now this is obviously pointed at the
[45:41] child
[45:42] right just by clear language he that
[45:44] wastes his father and chases his mother
[45:46] causes shame and brings reproach so son
[45:49] stop listening to the things that cause
[45:50] you to err from the words of knowledge
[45:54] so then what is our responsibility our
[45:56] responsibility is that we are giving the
[45:59] correct law the correct knowledge
[46:01] the the the rule the wisdom of the
[46:03] father the law of the mother we have to
[46:05] recognize our responsibility that's
[46:07] already assumed in this this is a
[46:09] presupposition to this
[46:11] that he that wasteth his father and
[46:12] chased his mother causes shame and
[46:14] brings reproach when what they have
[46:15] brought him to is the words of knowledge
[46:19] to ways just to spoil what has been
[46:21] given the bible is saying that he
[46:23] robs and insults those he ought to honor
[46:26] when they have initiated him in the
[46:28] right path when they had given him the
[46:30] right spiritual instruction when they've
[46:32] looked out over a spirit and despite all
[46:35] the nature that they gave him by natural
[46:37] birth they nurtured him in the holy
[46:39] spirit and nurtured him in the
[46:40] admonition of the lord and they
[46:42] and they used that holy spirit to work
[46:44] against their base instincts and and
[46:46] used it to apologize when necessary used
[46:49] it to moderate when necessary used it to
[46:51] guide their child's heart while they had
[46:52] the opportunity to keep that garden
[46:54] cleanest as a child that then wastes his
[46:57] father and chases the way his mother
[46:59] that causes shame and brings reproach
[47:04] but the power to waste and chase only
[47:06] existed because the power
[47:08] to raise and praise
[47:11] he would only have power to waste and
[47:13] chase if by the virtu by the opposite he
[47:17] had power to raise them up
[47:19] by he had the power then to praise his
[47:21] parents to be to be a legacy something
[47:24] that spoke of their legacy something to
[47:25] be cherished something to be honored
[47:27] just as the woman is a crowned or a
[47:29] husband but he she that make it ashamed
[47:31] is roughness in his bones she only has
[47:33] power to corrupt because she has the
[47:35] power to crown children only have the
[47:37] power to waste in chase because they
[47:39] have a power then to be the glory and an
[47:42] expression of something very beautiful
[47:44] in the parental union
[47:47] i say it this way there's glory in our
[47:49] children
[47:52] something that we have a duty to bring
[47:53] out of them
[47:59] that's why i came with the idea of
[48:01] digging for gold
[48:04] i'll be honest i asked a couple brothers
[48:06] how the title gold digger sounded and
[48:07] they cautioned me
[48:14] in my innocence i might not know exactly
[48:15] what that phrase means so i just uh took
[48:18] their advice and backed out
[48:24] but that's what we're doing as parents
[48:27] it may not look like it
[48:29] but that bag of dirt sitting next to you
[48:33] got gold in it
[48:35] right
[48:36] there's golden
[48:37] and those children that god has given us
[48:40] brother branham says in the message come
[48:41] follow me
[48:43] and i i want you
[48:45] now
[48:46] to ponder this as i i can't read the
[48:48] entirety of the statement
[48:51] but he's praying he says let us pray
[48:54] and he says lord jesus youth
[48:57] men
[48:59] and women for tomorrow
[49:00] if there is a tomorrow
[49:03] we must train them lord
[49:06] we feel that burden to train them like
[49:09] there will be a tomorrow
[49:14] if
[49:16] if we get so
[49:18] uh spiritual
[49:20] super spiritual
[49:22] to where
[49:24] we think wow what's the point you know
[49:26] the lord's already come or the lord's
[49:28] coming tomorrow what's the point
[49:30] that you're not you're just not
[49:31] listening to the word
[49:33] we have a burden to train them as if
[49:35] there would be a tomorrow
[49:37] why do we have a burden to train them as
[49:40] if there would be a tomorrow because
[49:41] that's our duty today
[49:44] and in the fail and failing to perform
[49:46] our duty it only would delay
[49:48] the inevitable that we're choosing using
[49:50] as a reason to delay you follow me
[49:53] well i don't have to raise my kids
[49:55] because the lord's coming tomorrow the
[49:56] lord's like saying if you don't raise
[49:57] your kids i ain't coming tomorrow
[50:00] just using your language
[50:02] it's incumbent upon us why is there a
[50:04] language they're waiting on us they're
[50:05] dependent on us why is there have to be
[50:07] some liberty of the holy spirit to move
[50:09] through us so freely that it replicates
[50:11] the image of christ and it touches all
[50:13] that have gone into the grave and we go
[50:15] in the rapture because we have a duty
[50:17] that we must fulfill and will never
[50:19] fulfill unless our eyes are awakened to
[50:21] see the gold that sits in the chairs
[50:23] next to us tonight
[50:25] oh would it strike the heart of a mother
[50:26] or father to see the gold right now sit
[50:29] in their rooms out doing something else
[50:31] the gall that is out in the world today
[50:34] that could be in the house of god
[50:35] tonight
[50:39] and you say well okay brother aaron
[50:43] where's where's the
[50:45] where in the world do you get digging
[50:46] for gold in this
[50:50] i just personally i say there's a way
[50:51] that god confirms things to me and i
[50:54] know that i found the channel and i
[50:56] think every man of god has a different
[50:58] way of knowing that they've they've come
[50:59] to that mind of god
[51:01] but i have such an absolute confidence
[51:03] that i found the mind of god that i
[51:05] cannot waver on what i'm saying tonight
[51:08] and in this where he says we must train
[51:10] them this thought just kept coming to me
[51:11] over and over we must train and we have
[51:12] a duty to train like there will be
[51:13] tomorrow so i went back and i was
[51:15] reading the message come follow me
[51:18] and brother branham and i took the
[51:19] paragraph numbers out when i grabbed the
[51:20] quote here i don't have it because it's
[51:22] very lengthy
[51:24] he says can we pray
[51:26] and this is what he says we have a duty
[51:27] to train them like there would be a
[51:28] tomorrow
[51:30] but right before he prays
[51:33] he tells two stories
[51:35] and the first story he tells is this
[51:37] fairy tell story of a man who found a
[51:39] flower
[51:40] and found the flower and he's going to
[51:42] provide some magic and he says you've
[51:44] been poor your whole life now ask what
[51:46] you want and i'll give it to you and the
[51:47] man says yonder there there's a mountain
[51:49] yonder if it would open up i could go
[51:51] there in and find the gold in the
[51:53] mountain
[51:55] but the prerequisite was
[51:56] okay you have to take me with you
[51:58] everywhere you go you have to take me
[52:00] with you wherever i am then you can ask
[52:02] what you will he goes to the mountain
[52:04] and the mountain opens up and he goes in
[52:06] he says brother man says shells full of
[52:08] golden diamonds
[52:10] this this flower this magical flower
[52:12] opened up to him this this mountain of
[52:15] gold and diamonds and he put the the
[52:17] flower down on a rock or a table and he
[52:19] says now i'm a rich man i have
[52:20] everything i need and he says and and he
[52:23] i think he says he's gonna run to go out
[52:24] and he wants to uh grab something to go
[52:26] out and show all of his friends and the
[52:28] flower says
[52:29] you forgot the main thing so he runs
[52:32] back i'll get a piece of gold i get a
[52:34] piece of silver and the flower says but
[52:35] you forgot the main thing he runs back
[52:38] says in here we find all kinds of
[52:39] materials so he picked up a stone he
[52:41] grabbed all these things i'm going to be
[52:42] able to show the people and show the
[52:43] people he said for the final time you
[52:46] forgot the main thing
[52:48] and he turns oh be quiet
[52:50] i don't want to hear anymore forgot the
[52:51] main thing ran out the door and the door
[52:54] closed behind him with the flower inside
[52:56] and he had no way to get back to the
[52:57] gold
[52:59] why because he forgot the main thing
[53:02] he forgot his access to those materials
[53:04] he forgot his what brings him to that
[53:07] and then immediately he says years ago
[53:08] when i was i as a kid on a cattle ranch
[53:11] in phoenix he said i was reading a piece
[53:13] of a paper about a prospector
[53:18] and he said the prospector had come had
[53:20] found a struck a lot of gold
[53:24] and he said that when he had
[53:26] got the gold there an outlaw that had
[53:27] been following
[53:29] and knew that he had this gold
[53:33] and so he was pondering oh i can get i
[53:35] can become a rich man i've struck gold
[53:37] i've got all the gold here so much of it
[53:39] and as he was trying to go to sleep a
[53:40] dog kept barking
[53:43] and as it kept barking and barking he
[53:45] told it to be quiet screamed at the dog
[53:47] be quiet
[53:49] dog whine tried to warn his master the
[53:52] danger was lurking why this outlaw is
[53:54] there and the dog is trying to warn him
[53:56] of the one that's going to take his gold
[53:59] and he says that he took the prospect or
[54:01] had a shotgun didn't want to be bothered
[54:03] anymore and he killed
[54:05] the dog
[54:07] but then the prospector was killed that
[54:09] night by the outlaw i know a lot of you
[54:10] are familiar with the story right
[54:12] he tells the story about gold
[54:16] right before he says i have a burden
[54:18] i have a burden to train these young
[54:20] people
[54:22] i have a burden to train these young men
[54:24] and women at this point in their life
[54:26] and he said there's nobody makes this
[54:27] statement
[54:29] he said all his fancy dreams did him no
[54:31] good he stealed the voice that was
[54:32] warning him says there's nobody can try
[54:34] to do anything you kids you would never
[54:36] be able to do anything wrong after being
[54:38] raised the way you are unless you feel
[54:40] something tell you not to do it
[54:43] now don't ever steal that voice that's
[54:45] warning you
[54:46] so he says come follow me
[54:50] this is the
[54:51] this is the emphasis brother branham is
[54:53] this is the image that brother adam has
[54:55] right before he brings us to this
[54:57] statement
[54:58] we must train them lord
[55:01] we must train them
[55:03] like there's going to be a mar tomorrow
[55:05] we feel the burden to do it
[55:07] now i'm i feel like i'm taking the
[55:10] liberty i feel the liberty to take the
[55:12] liberty so give me i so i hope you have
[55:13] liberty to hear me take the liberty with
[55:16] the liberty that i feel like taking
[55:18] because and the burden to train i want
[55:20] you to recognize that it has something
[55:22] to do with the gold
[55:25] it has something to do with what's
[55:26] valuable has something to do
[55:28] with the deity that god wants to join
[55:32] with in our children's hearts it has
[55:34] something to do with the character that
[55:35] can be mined out of the flesh that sits
[55:38] before us and there might be things
[55:40] about our children that we don't like
[55:41] there might be things that we do like
[55:43] but if you can ever get past the facade
[55:45] if you could ever get past the the flesh
[55:47] if you ever get past that that that what
[55:50] meets the eye and recognize that down
[55:52] inside of them is a soul that is very
[55:54] precious to god and that has value and
[55:57] has merit then then i believe you can
[55:59] have inspiration i believe you can have
[56:01] motivation i believe you can recognize
[56:03] that you are a very wealthy person if
[56:06] given the responsibility to look after
[56:08] and to care for a son and daughter's
[56:10] soul
[56:12] and have this burden to train them
[56:15] and they say oh god may may i not be
[56:18] guilty of the man who left the main
[56:20] thing behind may i not be guilty of
[56:23] quieting that voice that warns me but
[56:25] god may i also instill in my children to
[56:29] recognize that beyond all the material
[56:31] things beyond all the blessings beyond
[56:34] the natural things they see in my life
[56:36] that you've given because you have to
[56:38] realize saints that many times it's just
[56:40] the tangible things that our children
[56:42] most readily identify as being the
[56:44] blessings of god but we have to find
[56:46] some way to let them know about the joy
[56:49] that's on the deep part of your soul
[56:52] that resides sunny shot like wind a rain
[56:55] lord that is there all the time
[56:58] there has to be a way to convey to them
[57:00] a steadiness and integrity and honesty
[57:02] and uprightness and that they can begin
[57:04] to value the main thing
[57:08] and the voice that preserves us
[57:12] nice
[57:13] brother branham makes this statement in
[57:15] the message an absolute
[57:22] he says i see the word is the absolute
[57:25] and i'm tied to it
[57:27] and determined i'll know nothing else
[57:29] but jesus christ and him crucified
[57:33] now brother branham speaks very
[57:34] personally
[57:36] but i believe that it has application to
[57:37] all of us
[57:39] and applications to
[57:41] the children of god as we would view
[57:43] them
[57:46] but lucas even think about what we
[57:48] fellowshipped on just briefly today
[57:50] think about how he says this no matter
[57:52] what anybody he says he had a reason for
[57:55] it and i'm determined to hold that
[57:57] reason
[57:59] no matter what anybody else says
[58:01] i don't disfellowship them or discredit
[58:04] them but i know what i'm tied to
[58:07] wanted me like this
[58:10] he made me like this
[58:12] i was made like that for a purpose
[58:14] i had to be made up of all these
[58:16] qualities and so forth think about how
[58:19] often we try to force people to fit our
[58:22] way
[58:23] and our whole purpose
[58:25] either it's a church that gets misguided
[58:26] or parents that get misguided or
[58:28] whatever it might be we think to train
[58:30] up a child the way he should go is to
[58:32] beat him into submission of the image
[58:33] that we think they should be instead of
[58:36] promoting an experience with jesus
[58:38] christ that'll make him into the son or
[58:40] daughter that he wants them to be
[58:43] but he says i was made up of all these
[58:45] qualities and so forth and all these no
[58:46] accounts so he could dig it out of me
[58:50] now there's
[58:52] that you might think oh he's got to root
[58:54] it out and get it out but i don't read
[58:56] it as something he wanted to get out in
[58:58] order to make you better but to get it
[59:00] out because there's something valuable
[59:02] in there he says put something in there
[59:04] that was his word there's some i can say
[59:06] this there's something
[59:08] that maybe we can say god takes away but
[59:11] it's because there's something else in
[59:13] there that's more valuable that detracts
[59:16] from the value and he wants to bring out
[59:18] of you the gold
[59:20] why because he put something in you by
[59:22] birth from the very time you're born
[59:24] there's an elect seed there
[59:27] he says his word
[59:29] and i'm determined i'll know nothing
[59:31] else but christ
[59:34] i realized we could read these things
[59:35] different ways but i want to look at
[59:37] just turn it on a different angle
[59:40] that god wants to dig the gold out of
[59:42] you
[59:43] he put something in there his word
[59:47] and he wants to bring it out of you
[59:49] maybe there's a lot of things
[59:51] that get in the way and cover it up he
[59:53] says but i'm determined on nothing else
[59:55] but christ
[59:58] if our musicians could make their way to
[59:59] their instruments
[1:00:01] i closed
[1:00:05] i'm determined
[1:00:07] to know nothing else but christ
[1:00:15] whether therefore you eat
[1:00:17] or drink
[1:00:19] or whatsoever you do
[1:00:21] do all to the glory of god
[1:00:24] whatever i eat whatever i drink whatever
[1:00:26] i do do all
[1:00:28] to the glory of god
[1:00:32] this is
[1:00:34] our
[1:00:35] ambition as christians
[1:00:39] therefore we
[1:00:40] should inspire our children to pursue
[1:00:43] the glory of god
[1:00:47] we should inspire them to
[1:00:49] to pursue it
[1:00:50] by our example
[1:00:52] and by our instruction
[1:00:54] because whatsoever we do
[1:00:56] we do for the glory of god
[1:00:59] you could ask yourself
[1:01:01] in times of difficult decisions what
[1:01:03] gives god glory
[1:01:06] what what can i do
[1:01:08] to give glory to god we may feel there's
[1:01:11] times that we have to preserve our
[1:01:12] particular position on something
[1:01:14] we might feel that there's a moment
[1:01:16] where we we want something to be made
[1:01:18] very clear like wow this person did this
[1:01:20] and i don't want anybody to know that
[1:01:22] and i think i should do this and there's
[1:01:23] a lot of a lot of things that kind of
[1:01:25] get in the way and muddied up but if you
[1:01:26] take a step back and say what will give
[1:01:27] god the glory
[1:01:30] do you find that there's a better
[1:01:31] decision in that
[1:01:33] because we're not always just defenders
[1:01:35] of what's right
[1:01:37] am i right
[1:01:38] now where sometimes we go wrong because
[1:01:40] we're just these justice warriors and we
[1:01:43] want to demand justice we want we want
[1:01:44] equity we want what's fair we want
[1:01:46] what's constitutionally right
[1:01:48] but even on that people can't agree
[1:01:51] so we have to ask ourselves what gives
[1:01:52] glory to god
[1:01:57] in that instance where a man lied about
[1:01:58] brother branham and said brother
[1:02:00] branham's not here he can't make it
[1:02:02] he got called away
[1:02:04] brother brahms just off the side of the
[1:02:06] platform sitting there
[1:02:08] and he said he's told why don't you go
[1:02:10] out there and expose this man
[1:02:13] he's he's lying
[1:02:15] and he goes oh brother i can't do that
[1:02:18] not in front of his people
[1:02:20] now you think you might think well that
[1:02:22] man deserved it amen all right i mean we
[1:02:24] all know what we would have done
[1:02:26] we would have been coming out there
[1:02:29] you know doing a dance like hello
[1:02:32] you know here i am we would have exposed
[1:02:34] the man he said that may be what the man
[1:02:36] was he's a liar that may be what that
[1:02:38] man needed he he's lying but what would
[1:02:40] have glorified god
[1:02:44] brother branham acted with the metric he
[1:02:46] acted with some with a compass
[1:02:49] he was very sensitive to what would
[1:02:50] glorify god
[1:02:52] and is that not how christ as the son
[1:02:55] he only did that which would glorify the
[1:02:56] father
[1:02:57] he did that which would please the
[1:02:58] father
[1:03:00] therefore we as parents have a have a
[1:03:02] resource in our children and what we
[1:03:05] ought to be doing in our own lives is
[1:03:07] digging for gold
[1:03:09] but what we recognize then in our
[1:03:10] children that there's so much gold in
[1:03:13] them
[1:03:15] that we can we can look over this
[1:03:17] resource
[1:03:18] and we say lord help me
[1:03:21] i i desire
[1:03:23] to raise them
[1:03:24] so they can discover gold
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:29] let's stand
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:43] let's pray together tonight
[1:03:51] heavenly father
[1:03:53] as we draw the service to a close
[1:03:58] a natural way lord the sermon has been
[1:04:00] delivered
[1:04:01] in the literal
[1:04:03] function of
[1:04:06] and the activity of the preaching
[1:04:08] as paul referred to it that the world
[1:04:09] calls it foolishness
[1:04:11] that
[1:04:12] that has transpired
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:15] that part has been done
[1:04:18] that i believe that that
[1:04:20] is
[1:04:21] furthering your
[1:04:23] vision your purpose your plan so it's
[1:04:24] not that anything has been initiated
[1:04:26] tonight or begun we're just working
[1:04:28] within the momentum of what you have
[1:04:30] already started
[1:04:32] and lord certainly in preaching this
[1:04:34] there is not a period that has been
[1:04:35] placed upon anything
[1:04:38] but lord it will continue as the people
[1:04:40] are dismissed
[1:04:42] my prayer would be that what was
[1:04:43] preached tonight would not only resonate
[1:04:45] as a good sermon lord i wouldn't even
[1:04:48] need it to resonate as a good sermon i
[1:04:49] would just that it would resonate in the
[1:04:51] hearts of your children
[1:04:54] as something that could be applied
[1:04:56] something applicable something
[1:04:58] mind
[1:04:59] altering and mood altering something
[1:05:01] that
[1:05:02] just
[1:05:02] moves the compass lord
[1:05:06] and father i know in my heart there's
[1:05:07] maybe
[1:05:09] there's many that i would like to as a
[1:05:11] pastor
[1:05:12] to be here to hear these things
[1:05:16] feeling that these wednesday nights give
[1:05:18] us an incredible opportunity to bring
[1:05:20] together
[1:05:22] a wonderful mix of believers
[1:05:25] and and capitalize on the atmosphere and
[1:05:28] the attentiveness and the expectation
[1:05:31] to do real teaching
[1:05:33] and to share on things that may are
[1:05:35] applicable where the rubber meets the
[1:05:37] road as it were
[1:05:39] and and to bring
[1:05:41] a transforming power to the lives of our
[1:05:44] children to
[1:05:46] relationships
[1:05:48] but lord we trust you in all these
[1:05:50] things
[1:05:51] and i would tonight that what we have
[1:05:52] ministered would hit the target for
[1:05:54] people
[1:05:56] and i know that maybe i'm using clever
[1:05:58] phrases and
[1:05:59] and things lord that might seem to be
[1:06:04] ambiguous
[1:06:07] but lord maybe you could speak to
[1:06:08] everyone differently on what it means
[1:06:10] the kids eat free
[1:06:11] [Music]
[1:06:16] but lord i'm speaking to prospectors
[1:06:17] tonight
[1:06:20] we have a job to do we have a duty
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:24] and maybe we're not getting out of here
[1:06:25] to the last nugget of his mind
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:29] it's the lord i busy myself and your
[1:06:31] kingdom
[1:06:33] and i take responsibility for the
[1:06:35] those that you've chosen
[1:06:38] for me to be responsible for i i own it
[1:06:41] lord
[1:06:42] and i pray for your grace and for your
[1:06:43] help tonight
[1:06:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:06:48] bless us help us i pray
[1:06:50] amen
[1:06:52] amen i know
[1:06:54] these things are challenging
[1:06:58] but a believer likes to be challenged
