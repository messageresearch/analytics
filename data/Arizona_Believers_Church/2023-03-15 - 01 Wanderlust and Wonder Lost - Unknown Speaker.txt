TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I believe you can all be excited tonight we have another installment of kids eat free and I know there's still a mystery and some Intrigue as to exactly what that means and I would I would want everyone to think about it especially those with Children what the concept of kids eat free is and maybe even go back over some of the sermons that we've ministered under this installment but based upon how the Lord has burdened me tonight and maybe for a few other services I wanted just to bring this back to our remembrance some of the things we mentioned last year it's probably been a while since we even referenced it kids eat free and the concept of kids eat free is that a restaurant would advertise it that if with the purchase of an adult entree and so the parents are paying but the kids are eating free that's the idea to get people in the restaurant to eat so however you want to think about that in the spiritual context you have that Liberty to do so but here's just another installment connected with the concept and the uh the series we were calling or segment we were calling kids eat free now my title tonight this is introductory just an introductory sermon on this subject is wonderlust and wonder lost and there might be a little bit of a play on words there for some of you I mentioned a Title Here recently to Elizabeth and she said you know whatever you do stick with what doesn't get lost in the translation and I'm not doing that tonight this could very easily get lost in the translation but the title is wonderlust and wonder loss and its potential series as I've been studying some things the Lord's been dealing with me on a number of different levels so it could be the beginning of a potential series but as we speak tonight I always just I yield to the Lord however he would want to bring it out there's times when maybe I feel that it's going to be a lot of dry teaching and the anointing just kind of grabs a hold of it and it comes out a little bit different manner than maybe I was thinking and there's other times when maybe I'm expecting things to be very maybe corrective and hard and the Holy Spirit just takes a hold of it and is able to bring it out in the way that he wants to so we're completely yielded to him in whatever manner that he would want the word to go forth but some of the scriptures we're going to use tonight and even some of the themes I think are often used in a very corrective way I don't want to say condemning way or a harsh way but just a corrective way where it's addressing something that's wrong and when I use them I by all means I want the Holy Spirit to correct where the correction needs to be made but I want it to be inspirational I want to be inspirational way to encourage us and I want to use the introduction tonight maybe just laying a lot of different pieces out there as I often do when I start a subject I have to kind of get my material out in front of me and then for the future Services I feel comfortable in just pulling from those different things to build but I'm hoping tonight we just use this as an introduction to provoke some thought and I think already the title has you thinking maybe one person okay I'm getting a nod just identify yourselves so I can face you tonight at the expense of everybody else who's already experiencing wonderlust and wanting to aimlessly travel home but wonderlust and wonder loss I was trying to find maybe a thesis statement to share with you at the outset so that you don't you're not sitting back waiting too long to kind of catch the thing but it's finding Wonder In Christ in the age of wonderlust and being able to find wonderment in Christ in an age where people are so restless and cannot be satisfied I believe that we it would be good for us to begin to find Wonder In Christ if we've never found it I want you to find it for the young people for any anyone who's never found Christ to be wonderful I want them to find it if that Christ at one time was more wonderful at one time than he is now I want you to find it again in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 he says For unto us a child is born and unto us the son is given and we know that this is referring to Jesus Christ and we know that the conception by Mary was a miracle in itself and very wonderful the Bible says Behold a young Maiden a virgin shall conceive and going to bring forth this child and so this announcement is uh prophetic but yet it's spoken in the present tense for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders so there is uh this is a this is the Messiah this is one who is going to have authority and Power in this the government being upon his shoulders it recognizes some God placing government into his hand it speaks of a king and then it says in his name Shall be Called wonderful there's some that might say it's wonderful counselor and use wonderful as an adjective a counselor but so many translations and even ourselves we recognize it that his name Shall be Called wonderful then it says counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace we know it's a con a paradox to have a child born but yet he's going to be called The Mighty God it's a paradox to have a child born and have his name to be the Everlasting father but yet it's true and it says his name shall be called that phrase his name shall be called it simply means he will be and that's something to the name Colin as we preached on it uh last year the the calling of a name and name calling how it's not just your name being uttered in the way that you were given by your parents but it says his name Shall be Called means he shall be wonderful and this word wonderful it means Wonder full of wonder it means Marvel a Marvel something that is marvelous something that's extraordinary even the way that he's described as far as the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace these are terms that would all cause some sort of um awe or thought of just the magnitude and how great he would be but something that is wonderful is extraordinary something that may be hard to understand it means to be marvelous and something to be marvelous it it has its roots in a Marvel is something and something is marvelous in itself it is a miracle Christ we could spend all night just talking about how wonderful he is Christ himself he is a miracle in himself if something is a Marvel it's something that causes astonishment it's something that would cause some sort of shock as we would say what I want you to think when I say uh wonderful and wonder it's something that would shock you to wonder is something that would be an amazement we might use the phrase Wonderstruck this is exciting and this Thrills me and this gets my attention and this something that energizes me when it says his name Shall be Called wonderful it means Christ is wonderful in his nature and his attributes and his manifestations he is something that is marvelous it's something that ought to cause astonishment and Jesus when he preached and in his early days of his ministry they were astonished the Bible says at his Doctrine it was something that shocked them something that caught them by surprise something that they would have been awe-inspiring this word that is used his name Shall be Called wonderful it's translated very uniquely in Judges chapter 13 verse 18. and the angel of the Lord said unto him why ask thou thus after my name seeing it is Secret that word means wonderful incomprehensible extraordinary its name is something you could just even track that through this name that no man knows and no man knows the father but the son and to he whom the son will reveal him there's this awe-inspiring concept about God how can I declare to you my name how can I tell you my name when it is incomprehensible when it is extraordinary where just a mere phrase cannot tell do it justice and how can me telling you an appellation or some sort of a phrase that's used to identify me how could that ever Encompass what I really am for it is wonderful passing our our imagination a wonderful Marvel something extraordinary something that causes us to be amazed or to shock with Wonder and I'd like to say this without spending too much time laying this part particular Foundation but it is the nature of Christ it is the nature of Christ to be awe inspiring and I believe that Christ being in the image of the invisible God in the Christ being the Revelation if I could put it this way Jesus Christ is the Living Word that makes God present so it's not just someone of History it's not just something of the future but even now Jesus Christ is the Living Word that makes God present and I believe that Jesus Christ can be the source of endless Wonder that Christ now when I when I say this I when you think of wonderment or excitement or awe and all these different adjectives maybe we use maybe they've been used of things that are natural maybe they're used of things that you enjoy and we might say oh baseball is a beautiful game and every time I watch it I'm always in awe of certain talents or gifts or the way that they play there might be things that inspire you when you go hiking and you see a sunset or you do certain uh make certain accomplishments there might be an excitement or a wonder that you're pursuing but I believe that Christ is a source of endless Wonder for the believer the Bible says in Exodus chapter 15 verse 11 who is likened to thee O Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious and Holiness fearful and Praises doing wonders this is uh just honest questions in the rhetorical because there is none like him none can compare to him who is like thee and then it gives these different phrases glorious and Holiness fearful and Praises doing wonders different ways of saying in all that you are and everything that you do nothing can compare to you and I believe that God is a God that overwhelms that can overwhelm our human senses has anyone here ever been overwhelmed by the greatness of God overwhelmed by the goodness of God God is one that if you could catch just the tiniest bit of his nature just see any part of God even seeing him in creation seeing him in any way that expresses him in some uh minute or even just the skosh of detail God is breathtaking God is exciting and this is the truth that we could bring out through so many different scriptures that Christ is a source of wonderment now I want to introduce and Define what I mean by Wonder loss it's wonderlust and wonder loss by Wonder loss what I'm referring to is when we lose our sense of awe when we lose that reverential feeling of awe and excitement and amazement of Christ when we're no longer inspired by him we never have a sense of all about him maybe we could say that there's things about Christ that seem to become common or it doesn't quite do for us what it used to do at one time and if there's a way that you could relate to personal relationships or maybe personal interactions or things that you love in order to understand this but we're wanting you to consider that there's things about Christ that ought to be enthused in you and maybe there was a time when just the Bible and the word and and things of God were things that got you excited and you smiled about it and you could laugh you look forward to church you were excited to go and maybe just different things that can happen in your life and you say well that was a that was a time of of love and a time of thrill and things were taking place and it felt really really good but in the process of time it feels as if something begins to wane a little bit and you're you kind of get whether it be jaded or you just become numb or you become hardened whatever it might be you're not quite feeling the same way you used to about Christ and the things of God have kind of lost their their wonderment I want to use the children of Israel as an example of Wonder lost and I want to use it as they took as they left in an exodus and just use some different scriptures this particular scripture here combines the elements together so we'll start with Psalm 78 verses 11 and 12. and speaking of the children of Israel it says and forget his works and his Wonders that he had showed them marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the field of zoen and we could read more in other scriptures and even just take you through the Journey of The Exodus the things he did in Egypt the things he did the Red Sea even the things that he did in the wilderness and how that God was always declared in his presence amongst the children of Israel despite opposition and difficulty despite uh maybe desires to go back despite maybe the concern for bread despite a lot of different things that may be naturally and humanly it would have been understandable if they begin to worry but God was always doing something in a wonderful way to get their attention to be able to say hey I believe he's with us even if it was just looking down at their shoes and recognizing that they never wore out even if it was recognizing Health that was amongst them and oh a promise of overcoming enemies and it says that they forgot his works and his Wonders that he had showed them when it says these wonders I I we ought to think just how extraordinary it would have been for all the Egyptians to be groping in darkness and the Israelites to see clear as day it would be remarkable because it didn't just say there was light in Goshen but it said the Israelites had it in their dwelling so wherever they it may have been if they were dwelling in the house of an Egyptian as a servant they had light with them and they could see differently than the rest that were around them these were tremendous Wonders that would have been rehearsed in the ears of the children and been rehearsed amongst themselves and as God brought them out across the Red Sea think about how awesome that was how awe-inspiring it would be to see the Pharaoh's Army get swallowed up by the Sea so when the Bible says they forgot his works and his wonders we're not just talking about someone testifying that they had a headache and now it's gone these are incredible things marvelous things did he these are the things that cause wonderment or astonishment these are the things that would have been so remarkable to them that would have caused them to say remember when remember when and the things that they could have looked at and recognized but now in Numbers chapter 21 I found myself just getting lost in this today and wanting maybe to Veer in different areas but I'll just be very strict to some principles here to bring out but this journey to me is so striking and how that they it worked on them to cause them to lose sight of his works and his wonders and The Marvelous things that he did in other words this is how Israel's Wonder of God was lost as it says his name Shall be Called wonderful there should have been something that was always God was awe-inspiring to them as long as he whatever he was doing they should have been in awe of it and it says and they journeyed from Mount hore by the way of the Red Sea to Compass the land of Edom I want to come back to the land of Edom and what that would represent and the soul of the people were much was much discouraged because of the way and the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul lothis this light bread now it's not using light maybe in the way that we do about uh you know skim milk and or whatever it might be that's light light sour cream and things that are just light in the fat Department it says this light bread the bread that they were loathing was the manna that was daily falling from heaven and and this is where the children of Israel got that every day they woke up and there was Manna which means what is it and the rich oral tradition surrounding the Manna uh to the Jews they believed that the phrase using what is it that to whoever ate it was to them the thing that they desired the most and so this one person could eat it and it taste one way another person could eat it and taste another and and that's the way that it could have always been but they they came to a place where even though God is continually to do something that only God can do in providing them bread their whole perspective of everything had changed to her now says their soul lothith the supernatural bread that is daily falling this is an incredible condition to be in that as they come to a particular place in their Journey where God is continuing to give them what they need to sustain them day by day but their attitude towards it has changed and I believe that there's a lot here that I I just want to mention and get to uh to be able to go further in this and with with you that are here tonight being the mature Believers you are I believe that maybe you could you could think a little bit more broadly than the way that I referred to it but it says that as they traveled the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way so the way made them discouraged the way he speaks of their manner of Life a manner or a habit but something in the way discouraged their souls it wasn't where they were going and it wasn't so much just the path they were taking though if you look at the way that they were going there's a point where God said turn northward and they could have just crossed right over him but they decided to go a little bit different route and so now as they're traveling they are going by the way of the Red Sea to Compass the land of Edom and it's as they go past this land of Edom that the Bible wants to say the way the soul of the people were discouraged because of the way the course of life you could even say the way that they were journeying the way that they were going but when it said the land of Edom this is what caught my attention they were faced with other descendants of Abraham these would been the uh come from Esau they would have been related to Israel and the Israelites through Esau as they passed by Edom there were certain declarations made in Deuteronomy chapter two about Edom that uh year to not make any alliances with them you you paid them for whatever they give you uh you were to they were to pass through it and they should and God said I'll put fear of them upon you you'll be able to pass through and so they had already been told how they ought to approach Edom they had delayed even that passing through and there's a lot of things that just go along with this but now as they pass Edom no doubt something about Edom influenced them something about the way and even the journey they had to take they're considering well what about these and what about those and what about what they do and and I want to use this even if even if we can't make the direct connection that Edom was specifically saying things to them and showing them things the Bible tells us that once they pat they're going to go about the land of Edom that their souls were discouraged because of the way and I believe it wants us to consider the example of Edom the Bible says in Genesis chapter 25 verses 29 to 34 and Jacob sod pottage he was maybe that's a good way to define cooking these days what do you do I'm just sodden pottage uh Jacob sod pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint so here's uh Jacob cooking Esau's hungry after hunting and Esau said to Jacob I know you're familiar with this so we'll just read it the way the scripture is describing it feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom which is red or Ruddy so he Esau is given this new name Edom based upon the pottage that he sold his Birthright for him and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright wow what what a what a heel grabber oh you're hungry you're about you think you're about to die tell you what I'll give you some of this red pottage if you'll give me your right as the firstborn and Esau said behold I'm at the point to die what prophet shall this Birthright do to me Jacob said swear to me this day now remember the Bible in Hebrews called uh Esau a profane person because of these things and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear into him and he he sold his birth right unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and this phrase to me just stood out to me so much this this week he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way this is this is the transaction just sold his Birthright and he saw eats drinks raises up and goes his way he says thus Esau despised his Birthright and the ancient Hebrew translation and the ancient text uh that they've uh from Jerusalem it says he despised his part in the world to come and denied the resurrection of the Dead this is quite a turn no wonder the Bible calls him a profane person there's a lot of uh there's some you know teachings in the Hebrew tradition and he went out and did five different things to profane himself and to violate God's covenant but says he did eat drink rose up and went his way and Esau despised his Birthright this is what rep Edom represents there's there's the eating the drinking going their way but this despising this disassociation this deprivation from the birthright and as the children of Israel passing by Edom it says their souls were much discouraged because of the way and they actually begin to detest and no longer enjoy and look forward to the wonderful things that God was doing and I believe that even for us as we try to make this relevant to us I believe that the way has a way of discouraging our souls there is a the life now as we enter into it and as we Labor Day by Day and we regardless of whether you're a student whether you're a parent whether you're a husband that's working a mother that stays at home all of us from the youngest that are here and able to understand my speech to the oldest that are here and able to endure we have the ability to relate to what I'm trying to say that there's just something about life and no matter how we live there's just a way of the demands and the things that get our attention that have a way of discouraging our souls and I want to say this and maybe come back to it later but this is where my my using this idea of Wonder loss begin to come so real to me and God confirmed me and it was so many different things that there's just a way that the way manipulates our senses causing us to feel a loss of wonder that if the CH that way is what discouraged The Souls of the children and as the way cause them to be discouraged and their souls are discouraged they're no longer moved by the Supernatural and their soul begin to load this light red and they actually wanted to go back to Egypt because something in their minds begin to tell them that it would be better in Egypt and so there was things about Egypt they must have been remembering quite well but there also must have been things about Egypt that they were forgetting quite easily because there ought to have been no desire to go back to Egypt surely they were better off wandering on their way to a permanent possession than languishing in Egypt under bondage but yet that's just how much their soul had been manipulated their minds have been manipulated and they they had the Wonder had been lost and now they find themselves wanting to go back to Egypt and I believe that this life has a way of manipulating our senses to cause us to lose a sense of wonder of the things of God like Esau the Israelites Israelites had lost The Wonder of what God was doing for them presently in sin and bread and what God had promised to do for them by giving them a possession in the Promised Land they they were they had lost and this is so important and I realized that now I had taken a few things out of my notes in terms of other quotes there had been a quote I was wanting to use I think it's from things that are to be where brother Brown says we're going to a real place I was wanting to use that in the subject of rewards he says we're going to work and brother man I was saying he's describing it in a way that we would describe the life we're in now and it's a real place it's a real place that we're going to and so that just like Esau in the moment was willing to sacrifice his future for a little bit of satisfaction he had lost respect for the birthright the fact that he was the firstborn if you just think in terms of The Coincidence of it or just the sheer fact that he was had another brother that was in the womb with him and to think my I'm the one with the birthright having just been born first that there could have been something that he always found comfort and in some uh position with his father and relationship that he had we feel like oh this is something to be treasured this is something that is worth something but then in some moment he begins to weigh it and says what is it to me if I die and uh oh it's not going to be worth anything to me anyway so I went ahead and traded it so Esau there was some sense uh what he had been able to be deceived that's the phrase I think I'm looking for he deceived himself into a transaction that was completely worthless it says he despised the birthright and so in that way Israel like Esau has allowed themselves in this place as we read it in numbers to begin to think well they're not even recognizing what God's doing and sending them Supernatural bread day by day to feed them and they're complaining about other things and complaining about this but there are so many other things God was doing to declare to him as present to them his presence and they were no longer in all what he was doing presently and they were no longer in Wonder of what he was going to do and bring them into the promised land and my thought to you is this if I repeat it over and over again I won't apologize we cannot lose our sense of wonder for the things of God there has to be if if in any way we have resigned to some sort of pattern or condition and we have just accepted if it be through the war of attrition are just having so long been in a certain way we cannot allow ourselves to just be resigned to a routine and say this is it this is just what we this is just what Christians do it's just the mundane it's just wow you just go and wow I don't enjoy it well you just go and I don't get anything out of it well you just go and and I don't feel the presence of God well it doesn't matter and this doesn't happen well it doesn't matter listen we we cannot allow ourselves to live below our privileges we cannot allow ourselves to be beaten into submission to the deceptions of the enemy let's not be in the mindset of an Esau let's not be in the mindset of Israel let's not lose our sense of wonder to where we just accept things as routine and we say well this is just it what I believe that can happen and this is my heart's crying for us as Christians is oh God awaken me to your Wonder awaken me to it let it be real to me let it be let me walk out every morning and see the man and say oh my goodness honey you won't believe it there's fresh man in the field even if it's happened for days and decades and decades still just beat this sense of it's still there there's something about the routine that the devil wants to just rub our nose in it and in doing so get us cause us to kind of lose a focus of the Divine the Bible says in Revelations chapter 3 verse 16 so then because Thou Art lukewarm this is the condition of laodicea and and I'm just kind of narrowing this down it says so then because Thou Art lukewarm and either cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth this is the Judgment of laodicea lukewarm it's tepid and the word that's used there it means that there is they're sluggish or numb as you're studying again trying to get just New Perspective on it and it's definitely if you tie this in later on we'll come to it how that laodicea is kind of like the final product of something and as they come to the end and the church is coming to its end it's sluggish it's numb it's indifferent I I would that you either be hot or cold that there is whether we look at it as some sort of fervency or some sort of disdain I I would that you'd be in some some extreme and have a take on something and have an opinion that it care that it mattered but he says you're just kind of indifferent in other words you're not moved you're not excited and this is the condition of laodicea and the more that we realize now you realize just how remarkable is or maybe maybe remarkable is not the right word but I think more and more the the identity of this age is laodicea it's been Vindicated it's been validated we've never questioned it but the existence of it is more pronounced than ever it's people's rights and it's such an age of people's rights to where there's you almost have to be indifferent lest you take a tank you have a taker you have a position the chances are you're going to offend somebody but it's just the age it's the spirit on the age just wearing us down and overwhelming our senses and causes to become indifferent and it's not just the it's not an indifference towards Natural Things the indifference is towards the things of God and brother Branham says about the things of God he said it should thrill us should be fresh every day I know this may seem to be old-fashioned and they say well brother Aaron that was back in the days when they had all night prayer meetings it was then this happened that happened all that was before the seals are open whatever you want to say people are going to have their excuses but I trust that you left your excuses uh with The Neighbor Next Door and they're handling them they're dealing with them tonight at home and that you're here without an excuse and you're here without reasons to wiggle out of the the pressure of the word of God he says it should be fresh every day and you know what I would do if I was you I wouldn't judge Myself by that I would actually tell God that's your promise and if that's your promise deliver on it because I want this word to Thrill me I want this word to be fresh every day and instead of trifling with it and arguing with it and blame it on everybody else say Lord the prophet said this message should be fresh every day I want it fresh today I want it to fill me every day I wanted to be real to me every day so it should be fresh every day just new to us all the time just Thrills us to feed and feast on the word of God this is an old-fashioned outdated Antiquated ideology this is the truth this is this can be a present tense reality in the face of everything that exists in the world today and all its lights and glamors and shows and all ITS Technologies and all its bells and whistles and all the ways that it has to enthuse us and get inside our minds listen layover to see it at its peak has figured out a way to make touch every single bias point you have in every trigger you have and you're completely hooked up to it but the word of God should thrill us in the same way to the same measure that laodicea will find a way to to move you the word of God has a greater capacity but that's where the wonderlust comes in if we if the Wonder has been lost the wonderlust is any anybody here familiar with the terminology wonderlust Preston thank you you know I that there's it's a phrase that I think it's pretty common maybe it has a kind of a really charged lust and you say that maybe you get everybody kind of gets nervous on what what the subject's gonna be just that the lust there does speak about a strong desire but it's a strong longing or impulse towards moving about aimlessly and this in no way is directed to those of us who like to travel but there's some that like to travel just for the sake of traveling there's no destination in mine it's just they want to be out on the road they want to be out they just want to be ambling and roaming and moving around and that's what wonderlust is it's a strong longing or a four or an Impulse towards moving about aimlessly or roaming and it has a German roots and its etymology but so wonderlust is lust which is a desire appetite or inclination for one Doreen and the wondering this is the way the phrase is originally used though we could use wonderlust as oh I just want to go on a road trip or oh I just want to go hiking and see where to lead me but the wonderless I'm wanting to zero in on is how that it's a Lust For wondering and wondering is pointless movement it is irrational and irrational course where it's just this restlessness it's aimless Meandering aimless movement it's roaming or hiking or traveling and there's no goal in mind that there's no progress to except counting steps it's just it's really pointless this it's a Lust For wandering pointless movement this wonderless is a strong impulse to being aimless untethered without Direction and the way that I'm wanting to present it it's wonderlust and wonder lost and there's a way that these are working together and so in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 14 just to pull a principle out for you on this now the the word of God is to be preached in love and God is giving gifts that can express to you the things of Christ that we can grow up and be him which is the head that we can there can be some maturity to come into the fullness of Christ it says that we henceforth be no more children and it uses this phrase toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine so this is this is to me what would become this wonderlust is that if there's just some feeling you just follow it that there's some enticement you just pursue it and certainly that is the mark of immaturity this is the mark of children that whatever whatever kind of captures their attention in the moment that they're in it they want to go to pursue whatever desires driving them in the moment without much thought as to what the consequences may be later or what the task was in the moment that they ought to be doing it it's just this to and fro it's aimless it's rambling it's it's without Direction and it says carried about with every wind that's kind of even to me it speaks to that wonderlust just wherever the wind takes me and I just have a desire to move on and I just and it's not really directed and it's not a Visionary it doesn't have a goal in mind but notice what the source of inspiration it says in cunning craftiness so there is some influence through cunning craftiness and this deceit that causes ones to be to and fro to be aimless to have this wonderlust where there's always sense of dissatisfaction and always just trying to find the next the next thrill the next Adrenaline Rush that's kind of what I'm thinking I said this wonderlust is It's kind of chasing the dragon and well I remember what it was like when this happened you're just trying to find the next time that you could just get that come on it's good yeah but it's cunning craftiness and deceit that works to cause people to become Restless and have a wonderlust that is pointless or aimless and I mean this both in a worldly sense and a religious sense and I find that I find it for myself with the audience that's present here tonight I find that I don't feel the the need to address it in a religious sense that oh we've got these religious heirs and we're we're pursuing things religiously and and I don't know that it would have to be this drastic to those that are present here this evening this drastic admonishment you know to cut ties with the world but I I I I would say that you're in this you're you're going in the right direction and I'm just going to push you in that direction but let me just say that both in a worldly sense in a religious sense that this tossing to and fro and carry it about and there's this cunning craftiness trying to do just as it did to Esau and the children of Israel and just what I'm trying to say trying to cause us to lose our Wonder for the things of God and once the wonderful the things of God is lost it becomes wonderlust they were just we're just we're just moving after things and we're Desiring things and maybe there's ways that the what the with the loss of Wonder people just become stagnant they become stale they're unmovable they just accept things there's no even itch or desire to move on they just accepted defeat but I wanted us to think very broadly both in a worldly sense and a religious sense how that there's things that come and try to work against us to cause us to lose the Wonder for the things of God and this can be anything that diminishes the amazement and the cause to wonder for the things of Christ Jude 13 says speaking of these characters that are fit for punishment he calls them Raging Waves of the sea foaming out their own shame and this phrase wandering Stars to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness forever brother random picks up on this this concept of wondering stars in a few places I'll maybe share them at a later date but this wondering Stars it means roving misleading this is the wonderlust it's something that becomes a vagabond uh that you know any port will do right that that I'm I don't have any particular place I need to sell my goods I don't have any place I need to park I don't have any particular place I'm going just to vacuum on a one who's just tramping just wondering this is what's meant by that phrase wandering stars and they're being led into air and they're misleading because they're just roaming wondering aimless and there is a H let me just try to think of how I want to say this if you could turn to Revelations chapter 2 verse 4 I want to I want to go into this this verse here but let me I want to think of a way that I could express this to you uh to this point maybe as a halfway point this wonderlust there are forces now you you the way that you're feeling you say well this is the way I feel and this is the way I'm Desiring to act there are influences that are causing that and and we need to recognize that that the way you're feeling and I say this with Grace if you're not as excited about the things of God as you once were that's not you that's something doing that to you if you're if you're not praying as much as you ought to that's not you that's something doing that to you if you're not feeding on the word of God like you ought to listen this is Grace that's not you that's something doing that to you there are forces that are pushing these aimless Pursuits and it causes the loss of Wonder for things that are real things that are simple things that are of God I hope you catch this because as I said this is introductory and I'm not trying to hide anything but I want to be very careful that I I I that I say it in a way that you don't just hyper focus and even one example but if I could say this well maybe I'll just try to use an innocent example the first birthday that we ever celebrated my wife and I her birthday after we got married she wanted me to take her to Pizza Hut that's where she wanted to go eat and to that point that was something that she enjoyed and for her birthday that's where she wanted to eat now where she wants to go right because now her taste buds have been awakened and she's been she's been made aware of better things and now she can't go back to Pizza Hut right because she knows that there's something better right and this is now that's in a natural sense that once you've been awakened to something it's like hey do you want to go get pizza there's a pizza and it's like seriously Pizza Hut why don't we just go to Pizzeria Bianco and wait four hours it's worth it right or we might have somewhere or at least a regular nose right because it's like hey I've had the good stuff I can't go back to that now that's just that's just a natural example but it shows how the mind works that once the Flesh and once our feelings our taste buds our emotions are moved in a particular way you can't go back to the way that it was before and so there's a way that the world has begun to sensitize us and work on us to stir us up in an emotional realm and when that is more often exercise then the Soul then the thing that you're more conscious of is the wonderment that the flesh seeks which is the Wonder lost and you begin to lose your Wonder for the things of God and you're being pushed into things that seem to be more real and more animated and more exciting and the things of Christ seem too simple for you anymore like who would want to sit down and listen to brother Branham when you could put a VR headset on and immerse yourself in an alternate reality I would even go so far as to say some people don't read their Bibles or listen to the message anymore because there's too many charismatic message preachers out there that you can stream on YouTube and I said charismatic so I'm in no way including myself but let's ponder that forces that are pushing you into aimless Pursuits that cause you to lose a sense of wonder for things that are real that are simple and of God Revelations chapter 2 verse 4 he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee we've already read his complaint to a portion of his complaint to the laodicean church age you're lukewarm you're indifferent you don't care nothing moves you nothing excites you but this is the beginning of it he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love it means forsaken left means to leave to die you've left it dying so there's a process I think that's evoked in this thou has left thy first love you have left it dying you have failed to nurture it that love is something that's living and something that love is something that's really says you've left your first love and first means the chief the first in influence the first in rank and you've left it and the love it's the love that speaks in a very broad way the sagape when it speaks of a person to welcome to entertain to love dearly to be pleased with to be content with you left your first love you've left dying the thing that used to content get bring you contentment you've left dying the things that you were pleased with you left dying the thing that stirred you that you were entertained by and you desired to entertain there was you've left dying the thing that made you feel welcome and that you welcome think about how it was when you first begin to serve the Lord and how new things felt and how fresh things felt like I say Elliot I thought of you today and how he must have felt when he at that last Camp he said called me and said dad I got the Holy Ghost and just how fresh things feel and how new things feel and there's a way that some of us might be thinking even now oh I remember that and God help us if we have to strain to go back to those days when he's just as real now as he was then but they had lost love brother Branham uses it in a phrase not just left thy First Love they lost it and so the passion and feeling as they left dying their first love this passion and feeling begins to die out now I say this and I hope to maybe revive this subject in another service and come back to it because God is dealing with me very heavily even in the emotional realm husband the wife and Family's fathers to children that the love is there he says Thou have left thy First Love there the love is there but it hadn't been nourished it doesn't say your love is dead but you left it dying because no matter how real and strong love is if it's not nurtured it'll weaken and lose power this is a this is true of any love this is the true of our love for things this is true of our love for one another this is true of our love that we have for our children it's Truth for the love we have for our spouse if we let too many things get in the way and we don't do enough to nurture that love the love is there it just gets weak The Love is Real it just gets covered up with other things no matter how real your love is for your spouse no matter how real your love is for your children if it's not nurtured correctly it will weaken and lose power and your love for God is real and your love for God is there but with the wrong kind of nurture whether it be in the church that you attend or the things that you feed on the right kind of wrong kind of nurture will actually cause the fervancy of that love to weaken brother Branham diagnosis the Ephesians Church age through a lot of different ways in the church age book and he begins to speak I cut this quote down quite a bit just to be able to share how you're saying and remember how he he brings out this idea that one has a genuine experience and in the second generation it begins to die out by the third generation it's good gone and he said this speaks to the principle that God doesn't have grandchildren so the first generation is a genuine experience but by the time you get to the third everything dies out and and he then he kind of he's just wants to track that that in order to avoid that you need fresh experiences for each generation you can't just live on the prior one and now but then he says this about the current generation he says I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that now he's I think he's pointing out something that's very uh thought provoking I'm not going to say they're not right with God and when he says they're not right with God I'm not going to say they're not right with God I believe that he is at least trying to indicate that they've had an experience that they had a genuine experience as he's saying this is salvation Salvation is of the Lord this generation where the Revival fires begin to burn they're right with God but that he says he says not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they're not the same anymore think about that they're still right with God but they're not the same anymore I want this to inspire you I I think that if I could just even say it in my own self that there's maybe this little bit of deceiving ourselves if it's cognitive dissonance I don't know what it is that wants to tell us well what I'm feeling this is actually faith and I think we touched on that in the series Nam is this Faith or am I numb but there's this idea that well this is the realm that I am that I'm in and this is just to mature love and and I'm just going by faith because nothing moves you anymore the message doesn't the word doesn't healings don't there's nothing that you can get excited about when it comes to the word of God and we say oh well this is just maturity I don't know about that I I I'm not going to say it's not I'm not going to say that you aren't right with God but are you the same anymore he says they're not the same anymore the fervent desire to please God there's your there's some tie-in too judgment Rewards and when we go maybe into the third or fourth part in this there's this connection to rewards that to me there's so the reward the concept of rewards is just so perfect he said the forever desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal that's lost Wonder and as soon as you lose wonder it becomes wonderlust I could line up the quotes where brother talks about just how then they begin to go from Pillar To Post roaming around what are they trying to find the Wonder again and true there's times where they go somewhere it's corrupt they do this and it's not what they're looking for what are they looking for they're real Matthew chapter 24 verses 11 and 12 it says in many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many this is both this is an ecclesiastical religious theological sense but there's also false prophets in the world today that are deceiving us through technology through social media and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold iniquity is unrighteousness the wondering or deviation from things that are virtuous from things that are real unrighteousness is a deviation from truth and righteousness is truth perverted the just the wondering from it it's that which causes a cooling love if there's a leaving of the first love brother Ram says they left the first love of the word I know there's a way that we can make it so Technical and so sterile that while just one step away from the word of God and and we make a sound well if you just deny baptism Name Lord Jesus Christ in a technical sense in a very real sense those are the theological steps that people take to get away from God but what about the individual that's right with God but they're not the same anymore how is it that that love begins to cool off how is it that they find themselves with their what love is waxing cold it means just go getting cold getting cold The Embers are no longer hot brother Brandon when he preaches the sermon entitled The Seven Church ages in 1954. he said what's the matter at the Tabernacle so glad we didn't name our church a tabernacle he says a man ought to be didn't expect some real fervents on that but that will consider that a vote everyone's in favor of Arizona Believers Church he says what's the matter at the Tabernacle a man ought to be able to say when you meet a man okay listen to this all right those of you who are old enough to be awake I want you to be awake a man ought to be able to say a man or woman a son or daughter of God ought to be able to say when you meet someone he says amen is your Christian experiences when was it the dearest to you you ought to be able to say right now this is what we ought to be able to say again I want you to take this with a measure of Grace that when he says that it should thrill us and it should be fresh every day that this is what we ought to take is this is a promise this isn't an indictment this isn't God taking my temperature and I've got a favor this isn't God calling me out I'm being sick this is a prophecy and this is a promise that his word can be fresh every day his presence can be fresh every day and this is a promise and a prophecy over my life that I can be able to say when would your Christian experience the dearest to you right now it ought not took Harkin back to the days of Revival it ought not to be back at a time at a camp meeting it ought not to be when you went to this church you're the greatest moments of your Christian experience ought to be this moment and then he kind of brings in this retort well my best experience was back when I first got the baptism of the Holy Spirit when I come he says just say oh brother you've fallen from Grace that's right look has left thy First Love he's quoting from the scripture left thy first love showing that they had something in the beginning and had left it this is what he said about Revelations 2 4. an example that he now brings into us as Believers is that when we are asked what's the dearest moments of your Christian experience our answer ought to be this one right now that ought to be the way that we should feel about our church experience it's the way we ought to be feeling about about our relationship with the word of God when was it when was it the most Clarity and you go well I mean it's just so cloudy now let me think about this uh man you know I need to go back to my timeline let me go back and look at my post on Facebook and find when it was real to me let me let me cycle back through my comments on Instagram uh and see when I was getting a little bit more feedback from my post when was it clear to me he's saying no you ought to be able to say right now that there's it's something about the now this is the best it's I I just think that it should not bring any it doesn't bring any shame to where we've been at this if this where we are now is the best it's the way that it ought to be but the wonderlust if someone says what's the what's the what's been the best experience when was the experience the best for you it's like oh man I don't know it's the wonderlust it's the aimless what are you looking for you're trying to find something you're trying to find something he says they had it in the beginning they left it now once you've left it all you will be as aimless till you come right back to it and if I could say this to the young men that are before me the young ladies here the young people to all of us but I certainly have a heart for the young people in this age the young adults in this age uh to to for Christ to become a Wonder to them to become real to them be more real than the things that they see in this flesh but can I say this if there has been any sense of loss of wonder I I can we restore that can we restore our sense of wonder where we kind of shed the lukewarmness the indifference I think if I could I just a purpose in my heart that I would just follow however the Lord was pulling and wherever the needs would be but I think we just get caught up in so many so many so much of the polarization and the message so much of the criticism so much of the extremes that it just caught we just we just get indifferent well how do you feel about prayer lines well I mean how do you feel about them first you know like I don't want to have a take on it unless you know I'm the one that you mentioned the next time you talk to somebody else about it yeah you won't believe what he thinks about prayer lines but it's just like you almost like no matter what it is you have to do you just get beaten into submission even to take it the way this guy sees it or take it the way this other guy sees it or you just want to be like hey you know what I you know I just don't even and you know what that makes a lot of sense when it comes to politics right euthanasia write me debate me let's go for it you know you take a side you take a side let's let's hash it out and he said hey you know what I'm just gonna finish my turkey you guys you guys just if you want to talk about this there's a lot of things that maybe would be great just to bow out but when you can't talk about the word of God anymore and you get to the place where you can't mention this and you can't mention that you can't mention this and we just get indifferent what it does cause you to be lukewarm and whatever it is that's caused you to become lukewarm can we have our sense of wonder restored rekindle a waning love and I want to say this before we get to our closing quote if you want to rekindle a lost love if you want to restore a sense of wonder Begins by identifying those influences that are numbing you to the sensitivity to God's greatness you have to recognize when I mentioned earlier you still have the love but if you don't have the passion anymore you still have it but something did that to you if you don't want to pray that's not you something did that to you there's this conscious acknowledgment that's why I was going to use the scripture he says it to this Revelations chapter 3 where he says be zealous therefore and repent he says you're lukewarm you're tepid ah you're just indifferent I I don't even know that it it describes maybe on and off on and off it's just like man you're just you're just in the middle I can't tell if you know you don't even hate you don't even love you're just meh you're great you're just lukewarm you're muddy you're everything's just muddied up you're just indifferent and and if if there's this recognition he says be zealous in other words come out of that lazy Zone get out of that place of complacency and that's numbness and everything's just caught a common come out be zealous and the first thing we need to do is repent and that's a recognition that there that if I could say this and I know I know may seem very very simplistic but I I love being able to say it because I know it's true this message is awesome Christ is awe-inspiring there is not a greater thing in this earth than Jesus Christ there's not a greater wonderment there's not a greater miracle and I just have I have absolute confidence to say it in the in the face of critics and deniers or and whatever more whether it be agnostics or atheist I I can say this about Jesus Christ but then we ought to have this recognition that we repent of those things that have caused us to lose that sense of wonder for the things of God to recognize there's just things that we do in daily life in a repetitive habits goals things that we can pursue that just wear us down and train us to seek after other things instead of Christ and and I I sense it now to where I could say I could just say what you're thinking it's so hard to do the things that you know you ought to do so hard to pray it's so hard to read my Bible it's so hard to meditate on the things of God it's so hard it's so hard to find that or I try and it just doesn't excite me anymore I try and listen what you're trying to do is come right out of the sensitizing of all your senses through whatever it might be from the YouTubes to the switches to whatever else boy I could preach a sermon on getting the switch back in the home can I get a witness yeah I like this is write it down freshly inspired we need to switch back in the home but there's we come right out of having all of our senses energized and sensitized with all the things that are in the world or just even a few of them and then we we come right out of that that chamber right and then we just try to connect to the word of God it's like yeah church is just kind of boring right church is born hey you know what I guarantee you if if you're used to tick-tock I don't know how you get out of a tick tock but you you I mean your thumb can't move fast enough while I'm preaching right like move keep going brother Aaron right keep going until you find something you like and that's just if you think about that and this is where I'm just going to crack the door open and look at it we've become slaves to a dopamine cycle this is a true story I think this is where some you're like okay that Escalade quick because now this is getting real you don't realize it but it's the truth you've become addicted to a dopamine cycle and this is why wonder is lost and this is why it's wonderlust you're craving this brain chemical release with each new text comment like follow right with each new notification with each new achievement why else would an adult forsake the duty that they have to their children or to their job to play a game why else would they do it except the dopamine cycle that wants to achieve the next level that wants to get the next chest right that wants to achieve the next level that wants to get the star get the badge remember when Yelp well had you check in and you'd earn badges you'd just be in the parking lot start checking in at places right because you wanted the badge hey I got my liquor badge I just just happened to be next to the liquor store I was getting gas right didn't happen to me I'm dramatizing somebody else but that's just the you're chasing the badge you're chasing the Merit you're chasing the recognition and we say Hey you won't believe it I'm on level nine no way take it to the bank all right get a job with that there's nothing to it right I'm being serious it's wonderlust and this is what it's all because of the way that the bar the world is manipulating us and our attention span and our capacity for God has shrunk hello our attention span and our capacity for God has shrunk because the portal is closed off you've got a soul that can take it in you've got a soul that could feed on them in perpetuity there's a part of you that loves it enjoys it can live by but you've allowed your attention span and your capacity for God to be cut off because all that's shaped anymore is our emotions deep thought and deeper experiences are more difficult than ever I'm speaking the truth I know I'm standing on thus there thus saith the Lord deep thought and deeper experiences are more difficult than ever even nowadays the things that people call experiences are so shallow because it's just in their flesh just our mindless Scrolls this is the wonderlust Mindless scrolling meaningless Pursuits Wanderlust is robbedness of our Wonder and the Wonders lost I don't know if you could tell in that title slide I'm not trying to draw attention to my Photoshop chops but it's it's just crumbling the Wonders just fading away that's what's happening to us we've got we need to have our sense of wonder awakened and I want to say this to anyone here tonight who sees themselves as a leader I speak this to the heads of households I speak this to young men who have authority over their domain whether Mike have soon going to be married I say this to the fathers I say this to the mothers because you have the power to restore the sense of wonder to your children or to even give them the sense of wonder when you think about what these young men can do not only can they enjoy the things that have been done but they the things they can do and create and the world they can live in I mean think about it with Minecraft the world you can create and the engines that are out there they just updated an Unreal Engine the things that they can do these days it's so incredible to where the things that they're able to tap into in ways that they know that they can even begin to trigger certain Sensations even to the point where it's not just Audible and it's not just visual but there's going to be things that you can taste and feel and smell and hear and there's a way that they're going to be able to completely immerse the individual in a fabricated reality and when we think about what the world has to offer to our children and how the world just creates this hunger and it gets more and more and more where that's what enthusiasm that's what they want to see that's what they want to hear and that's what they want to listen to have them listen to the things of the world today and the music of the world today and then just try to play them the specials in church they don't have an appetite for it and I'm wanting you to recognize what it is and you think well how can I how can my child ever get excited about the things of God they can because God is greater God is more exciting it's just the truth of it and you as the the leaders within your home we have it I say this to my wife I say this as a a father and mother together I say this in the presence of my children I say this to you tonight as your pastor you can create and Quicken the sense of wonder for this message and the things of God in your home it's not a lost cause the ship hasn't sailed Christ is a Wonder and we can create a Wonder in our home for the things of God the sermon leadership this is where I bring it down to us as this leaders and there's so much more that we'll share well I just want to take a quick form formal poll how many would like for me to continue on the subject raise a hand okay I'll talk to those who didn't raise their hands later get feedback on that will be speaking to those that didn't raise their hands on hell fire and brimstone on Sunday evenings during the months of month of August in the sermon leadership everybody raised their hands as far as I could tell brother random says now to the children I don't know if you've caught this it just stood out to me when I was reading it this week and I don't know why it hadn't hit me with this much weight before now to the children and to the adults and all I want to make this little message just as timely as I can and as quick as I can my emphasis is on the timeliness he says and I want to take for text follow me I want to take first subject leadership follow and someone to lead leadership and follow me and he says I want to make this message just as timely as I can as he's here in October 1965 and he's preaching this to The Young and the old the children the adults he wants to make it when he says timely relevant he says and is quick and I don't think he's just talking about timing he wants it to be relevant he wants to speak to something that that means something in the day and age that they were living in and this principle now this is where I want to take this principle of the Unseen influences that are pushing you to wonderlust and pushing you away You've Lost Your Wonder so it's wonderlust and wonder lost and now you're being pushed to this there's influences worldly or religious whatever it is it's worldly influences this wonderlust in your life this aimless wondering and you've lost wonder is lost now doesn't matter to me which was first it's a wonder lesson a Wonder loss it doesn't matter if it's just one or the other you don't want to be in either state but think of how there's a wonderment that is lost and this Wonder lust which is just aimless just the flesh just this fleeting thing and I want you to connect it to this principle that he says of leadership so now I'm gonna skip a few paragraphs and he basically expresses this thought through Parenthood that you've always had someone leading you and he says you won the first Legend your steps was your mother because she's the one there at home he starts talking about fathers and mother and he does continue on in paragraphs 27 or 28 on those same or 26 or so on these same principles he says now in paragraph 23 now somebody helped you when you first made when you made your first step and now catch this and your last step you'll ever make in life somebody will be leading you there's an influence in the first step there's always an influence and there's an influence in the last step if there's one someone leading at the beginning someone leading at the end it tells us right now where we are right now there's influences there's leadership he says see that's right I want you to remember that your first step somebody LED you and your last step someone will be leading you we have to be led parents leaders young men fathers in the home husbands moms wives the adults you have to be led says you know God likened us unto sheep and did you know a sheep can't lead itself maybe they're well if you the Sheep are such that if they're not cared for they'll they can die that's just it's just something about the nature of sheep if they get away from the shepherd their coats can grow so thick it'll blind them get caught in thickets they'll topple over they won't be able to feed so there's something it tells us there's something about the nature that God wants to give us as sheep that we rely upon the shepherd and unless anyone twists that Christ is the shepherd a pastor is only in type or allegory a shepherd because he's still sheep right the pastor is not in in reality typed as an intelligent human being leading a bunch of dumb animals whenever a man thinks that it's obvious right whenever a pastor thinks that it's obvious because he's the one that knows it all and you guys are just a bunch of dumb sheep making them look bad but a pastor is a sheep himself right and in case you can't get that through your head the only reason why Jesus is the chief Shepherd the Good Shepherd and the grape Shepherd is he became a sheep it's what it takes to make a Good Shepherd what it takes to make a chief Shepherd you have to be sheep so there's no way we're going to topple this over to where the pastor is somehow you know the raw raw guy it's leading everybody without needing to be led himself we have to be led you know God likened us unto sheep did you know a sheep can't lead itself he'll wander away and stray away and he just can't lead himself and he has to have somebody to lead him maybe we'll have brother blessing come sing rain on a tin roof when we close but crack if you could just look at this the the maybe I could have broke this up a little bit better but that's second last sentence and he has to have somebody to lead him if I could say this you will be led by something you're going to be led by something so the shepherd is supposed to lead the Sheep now that was back in the days of the Lord Jesus he was the Good Shepherd that led the Sheep but today now notice how he just touches on it and I'm just going to wrap this up but today you see we're living in another day everything has changed and perverted you know what man has to lead sheep today a goat and you know where that goat leads them right into the slaughter then little sheep don't know where they're going so that the goat goes up a pin up at the slaughter and the Sheep don't know no more than to follow a leader so it leads them right up to this Slaughter and then the goat jumps over the track and the sheep goes in and gets killed see the goat a wrong leader I if I could say this I desperately want to close don't be a goat okay let's not be goats and let's not follow goats I know this runs contrary to everything we've been taught about being the greatest of all time but don't be a goat right don't be the one that's the wrong leader don't be the one we can get so frustrated with our children and I think maybe I've gone completely too far tonight maybe just in length toward this becomes a lot more practical than just the inspirational part but we've got to recognize the forces that are leading us and drawing us and it's the goat that caused us to lose our wonderment of Christ because we're wondering where the goat's going to take us what could it be where is he going oh my goodness this is amazed this is so awesome right you're running to the slaughter a goat's the wrong leader but Jesus the Good Shepherd who led the Sheep he he led them to life and held their hand and see somebody has to lead the Sheep I say that let's let's pursue Christ that with everything that is in us as the Bible says to us in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 in his name Shall be Called wonderful Christ This Good Shepherd Christ this Chief Shepherd if he will just turn our eyes to him he is wonderful he is not just called wonderful he is wonderful he is awe-inspiring he is a miracle in himself he's the unending never ceasing to amaze us God and if we could just take our eyes off the goats we can recognize that he still Thrills us today that I take it as a promise not an indictment it could still be fresh every day he can still thrill my soul my Christian experience can be at its peak today for his name Shall be Called wonderful Brothers if he could come to your instruments I was reading this scripture and I'll share it with you to close in Psalms 119 18. open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law that's right let's make that our prayer open up my eyes Lord then I may behold wonderful things awe-inspiring things amazing things the shocking things thrilling things from Thy Word to where I could read the Bible and it Thrills me don't even charge has no battery this is real technology this ink don't need to charge it don't need to update it you never open it up and get a blue screen of death hey you know it it never just Cycles off while you're using it because it needs to update I haven't got a notice from God that he's not supporting it anymore and it just seems it's just a book the words are sometimes weird English but you know what it could thrill you just as much as those graphic novels the world puts out it could thrill you just as much as the things that are on this Thrills you can thrill you just as much as the things that are on this Thrills you if I need to I'll grab the laptop I'll grab the desktop just what what screen do I need to wave in front of you to compare it in reality Nothing Compares to what God can show you in this this message may seem old but it's still living and it's more applicable and more relevant today than even for myself than it was when I first gave my heart to the Lord why because it's Christ it's awe-inspiring and I would somehow someway as a church we could begin to be leaders that restored The Wonder of Christ to those who are hungry for it Christ is no longer a Wonder let's just be honest Christ is no longer a Wonder to a lot of people we love to a lot of people we know and it's not even of their own doing it's influences that have done it and if we're ever going to be forever going to be water towers that others see so they can begin to walk around in God's word and find their way back home we need to be wonders of Christ too we need to have our sense of one to restore we need to begin to make decisions in our daily lives where I'm not going to allow myself to be repeatedly bombarded with the things of this world because it's caused me to lose my Wonder and I'm on this wonderlust and my wonders lost and I want to say Lord open thou my eyes open up my eyes to see wonderful things could that be your heart's cry does anybody feel that with a passion tonight is there anybody that feels that this is real in their hearts that this just isn't this is not just emotion this is just not trying to find some sort of gimmick to get you worked up that this presses a button deep inside your soul that says this is something that that I could say I haven't been able to quite articulate and you're in the you're in the malaise of all the wonderlust and you're in the Clouds of all the wonderless and something is shouting beyond that something's crying out to you beyond that what is it it's a wonder it's a wonder it's Christ wonderful counselor the almighty God it's that God who's awesome he's calling to you fill the wonderlust I say open thou my eyes just see wonderful things get out my eyes Lord just see wonderful things open up my eyes to see wonderful things Lord granted for me Lord Jesus open thou my eyes to see wonderful things oh Heavenly Father let's stand let's stand
