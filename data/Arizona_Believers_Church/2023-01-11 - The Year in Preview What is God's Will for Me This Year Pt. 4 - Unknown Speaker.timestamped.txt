[0:00] We're looking at the year in preview and
[0:03] asking the question, what is God's will
[0:05] for us this year? And I do believe that
[0:07] we can know God's will because and we
[0:10] can know the things that we're going to
[0:11] be doing this year in in a general sense
[0:13] and even in some specific ways uh
[0:16] because there are specific things that
[0:17] God has outlined uh that are his will
[0:20] for us. And in that way, it's a plain
[0:22] path. It's something that's been set and
[0:24] determined. These are constants that we
[0:26] can identify. And it's because of that
[0:28] that I'm using the phrase the year in
[0:30] preview that that we can look at these
[0:32] things and say, "Yeah, you want to ask
[0:34] me what I'm going to be doing this
[0:35] year." There's certain things that we
[0:37] can say that we're going to be doing.
[0:39] And it was on Sunday. I'm just going to
[0:41] use a couple statements from Sunday. And
[0:43] I'd like to read out of uh Hebrews
[0:45] chapter 2 part two where brother
[0:47] Brandham is referring to the widow of
[0:48] Zerapath and how that she baked uh that
[0:51] meal for God, that cake for the prophet
[0:53] first. And in doing so, there was
[0:55] provision and God provided. And we see
[0:57] that in that example. And as he has
[0:59] telling us we need to put God's first, I
[1:02] like to say that if we put God's first
[1:04] uh put God first, he will make provision
[1:07] for all the things that this year
[1:09] demands.
[1:10] And if you're budgeting, if you're
[1:12] thinking about how are we going to have
[1:13] enough to do this or we're wanting to go
[1:14] on vacation or wanting to do these
[1:16] different things, if you'll just put God
[1:18] first, he will give provision to meet
[1:21] all the things that this year will
[1:22] require. And he says, 'Oh, we need to
[1:24] seek the will of God. Not the favor of
[1:27] your neighbor, not the favor of your
[1:28] children, not the favor of your husband
[1:30] or your wife, but seek the will of God
[1:33] and do that first. Then everything else,
[1:36] the will of the wife and the will of the
[1:38] children will fall right in with it. But
[1:40] place God first. I think this is
[1:43] something we can bank on. This is
[1:44] something we can count on that God has
[1:45] promised us that if we put him first as
[1:48] Jesus even says in Matthew chapter 6
[1:50] that if you seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:52] God and his righteousness and all all
[1:55] these things whether it be provision and
[1:57] shelter and food and clothing and I
[1:59] would even say happiness and pleasure
[2:01] will be added unto you. But you've got
[2:03] to seek God first. And and he puts it in
[2:06] this way, seek the will of God first.
[2:08] And I know for some of us, we're seeking
[2:10] the will of God. we wanting to know uh
[2:12] should I change this or should I should
[2:14] I do this and it can be very very
[2:15] specific in terms of where we live or
[2:17] where we go to church or what job we
[2:19] have or what job we pursue or whether or
[2:21] not we um take certain options that are
[2:24] made available to us. There's a lot of
[2:25] specifics that can weigh us when it come
[2:27] weigh on us when it comes to God's will.
[2:30] But there are things that we can seek
[2:32] that we know are his will and that's
[2:34] what we're trying to emphasize. And
[2:36] we've used these six things. We'll just
[2:38] go through these two slides very
[2:39] quickly. Uh, attend church, contribute
[2:42] tithes and offerings, and support
[2:43] missions. This is God's will for us this
[2:45] year. These are things that we can say
[2:47] or thus sayeth the Lord. They're very
[2:49] clear in the message of the hour, very
[2:51] clear in scripture. These are three
[2:52] things that we can be doing. We can be
[2:54] putting our heart into. And as we set it
[2:57] up last Wednesday, these things kind of
[2:59] we would recognize um of attend church,
[3:02] contribute tithes and offerings, and
[3:03] support missions. If you want to go back
[3:04] to that other slide, these are things
[3:06] that we could recognize have a lot to do
[3:08] with what we're doing right now and say,
[3:10] "Well, that's our Sunday morning, that's
[3:12] our Wednesday night, and all the other
[3:13] opportunities that are afforded to us to
[3:15] make contact with these things." And so,
[3:17] we realize there's a lot of more time, a
[3:20] lot other areas in our lives uh that
[3:22] come under the umbrella of the word of
[3:23] God. And that's what we see in this next
[3:25] slide. Sanctify your home, gather around
[3:28] the word, and live for others. And let
[3:30] me just say this because I know you've
[3:32] probably all thought about it. easy to
[3:33] list, right? Easy to remember six
[3:36] things, but harder to choose, harder to
[3:39] do. It's not always easy. Um there's
[3:41] some in each one of these situations
[3:43] have unique challenges that makes it
[3:44] harder than for somebody else to do it.
[3:46] Uh if you are, I would say if you're
[3:48] living on your own and you have your own
[3:50] apartment or have your own house, uh I
[3:52] think it would be easier to sanctify
[3:53] your home. But then someone may say,
[3:55] "Well, no, it's even harder." Uh but
[3:57] I've witnessed the influence of
[3:58] roommates. I've witnessed the influence
[4:00] of other people in a home and different
[4:01] ideas from spouses and things. And so
[4:04] some of these can be harder for some,
[4:05] easier for others. But it's these each
[4:08] one of these things are something you
[4:10] have to choose to do and even labor to
[4:12] do. But in doing it, it's not an
[4:15] investment in church. It's not an
[4:16] investment in natural things, but it's
[4:17] an investment in your spiritual
[4:18] well-being. And it will pay dividends
[4:21] when you put God first. Now, I want to
[4:24] touch on Isaiah chapter 32
[4:27] 17 and 18. And this is uh summarizing
[4:30] some things from last time that we
[4:32] covered on sanctify your home. We will
[4:34] get to a large portion of gather around
[4:36] the word this evening. And what we
[4:39] emphasized in this and we use the the
[4:40] phrase applying the token as well in
[4:42] this that sanctifying your home is the
[4:45] act of removing influences a a and
[4:48] getting rid of stumbling blocks so that
[4:49] we can achieve a safe distance from the
[4:52] world. And that's what the home should
[4:54] be. It should be a sanctuary. It should
[4:55] be a place of rest. It should be a place
[4:57] of respite from the world. And that's
[4:59] one of the downsides of working at home
[5:01] because then you don't get that distance
[5:02] from work in some ways. But when we come
[5:04] home from work, we come home from
[5:06] school, we come home from the world, we
[5:08] want to have a sanctuary that doesn't
[5:09] have the same language, the same ideals,
[5:11] the same attitudes, the same
[5:12] entertainments, the same emphasis as the
[5:14] world has. And so home should be a
[5:17] sanctuary. And this description here, I
[5:19] believe the way we put this is when we
[5:21] read this, this is what we ought to make
[5:23] our goal and measure everything we seek
[5:25] to possess and everything we do by it.
[5:28] Like this is a goal. We evaluate things
[5:30] that we allow in our home, things that
[5:31] we pursue as entertainments, things that
[5:33] have uh some place in our lives. We ask,
[5:36] is there a limit to where it's no longer
[5:38] meeting this governing priority? And the
[5:41] work of righteousness shall be peace and
[5:43] the effect of righteousness, quietness,
[5:45] and assurance forever. and my people
[5:48] shall dwell in a peaceable habitation
[5:50] and ensure dwellings and in quiet
[5:53] resting places. This is what we want to
[5:54] achieve for our homes. This is a
[5:56] description that we would like to have
[5:58] for our families as they dwell in their
[6:00] homes. And so, this is something that we
[6:02] can make a goal and we're using this
[6:04] scripture as part of the idea of
[6:05] sanctifying our home, applying the token
[6:07] as we took from Ephesians 4:27. Neither
[6:09] give place to the devil. And that means
[6:13] you're not giving him any spot to move,
[6:15] no place to work from. If you take away
[6:17] all the the occasions from the devil,
[6:20] makes it much harder for him to impact
[6:22] us. And so there's way things that we
[6:24] need to identify, things that we need to
[6:25] recognize. Uh and I like to use the
[6:27] phrase applying the token, but I think
[6:29] we kind of knee-jerk begin to think very
[6:31] very legalistically, but applying the
[6:33] token is God's wisdom.
[6:34] There's things that have an influence as
[6:36] yeast does and has a way of puffing
[6:38] things up and has a way of pervading
[6:40] things completely. So God knows how to
[6:42] protect us and we follow his program. We
[6:44] can protect ourselves from a lot of
[6:46] dangers and a lot of ills by following
[6:48] God's wisdom and applying the token. And
[6:51] if we could use it this way, I think
[6:52] this is how we used it Wednesday night.
[6:54] Applying the token is avoiding
[6:56] influences and avoiding the things that
[6:58] would turn our minds away from God's
[7:00] will or cause us to compromise God's
[7:02] will. Remember how we used it in the
[7:04] book of Joshua? uh ready yourselves and
[7:07] sanctify yourselves and consider your
[7:09] ways. We used on Sunday but he's talking
[7:10] about sanctify yourselves against
[7:12] tomorrow. What was it? Get rid of all
[7:14] the things that would influence your
[7:15] mind and intoxicate you to where you
[7:17] don't see God moving and you don't know
[7:19] when to act. And so that's the idea of
[7:21] sanctification is recognizing all the
[7:24] things that have a way of influencing
[7:25] our spirit and our attitude and our
[7:27] perceptions and avoiding them so that
[7:30] we're not unnecessarily troubled or
[7:32] inspired in the wrong way. Amen.
[7:35] And I I kind of being drawn in this area
[7:38] to talk on strongholds and I I don't
[7:40] want to take the time to do it now, but
[7:42] that's really what we're doing when we
[7:44] sanctify our home is we're taking any
[7:45] place that the devil can hide and use as
[7:48] a base to attack us, we're getting rid
[7:49] of it.
[7:50] It doesn't mean he's not going to attack
[7:51] you, but at least it won't be from
[7:53] within,
[7:54] right? Or at least when it happens from
[7:56] within, it's better hard it's easier to
[7:58] recognize because he hasn't been able to
[7:59] build a stronghold. Right?
[8:01] In Romans chapter 14:13, it says, "Let
[8:03] us not therefore judge one another
[8:05] anymore." And that's a mouthful. But
[8:07] then he says, "But judge this rather
[8:09] that no man put a stumbling block or an
[8:12] occasion to fall in his brother's way."
[8:15] This could be a guiding principle for a
[8:16] lot of us as adults. It could be as
[8:18] friends, brothers to sisters, families,
[8:20] uh, working amongst one another. But
[8:22] this is such a good scripture to use
[8:24] when we evaluate the things that we lift
[8:26] up in our home is we don't want to put
[8:28] any stumbling block or an occasion to
[8:31] fall in our brother's way, in our
[8:32] children's way, and our spouse's way. To
[8:35] say a stumbling block or an occasion to
[8:36] fall, it's to cause one to stumble or
[8:38] sin or the thing by which one is drawn
[8:40] into error or entrapped. We look for
[8:43] those things in our home. The process of
[8:45] sanctifying our home is the process of
[8:48] removing any fluence that would lead
[8:49] someone astray or cause someone to
[8:51] stumble or give them occasion to fall.
[8:54] We are under a scriptural commandment to
[8:56] use wisdom to comply with this scripture
[8:59] for our children's sake.
[9:00] Amen.
[9:01] For one another's sake. And I think this
[9:02] is something that we could think uh
[9:04] think about very deeply and spend a lot
[9:05] of time on. I want you to think about
[9:07] that idea of stumbling somebody or
[9:09] causing an occasion to fall because it's
[9:11] going to maybe it's going to be
[9:14] supported as we go deeper into gathering
[9:15] around the word. And so if I could
[9:18] summarize it this way, this is a
[9:20] preview. If we have this ideal that I
[9:23] want to sanctify my home, it becomes a
[9:24] preview of the fact that I'm going to be
[9:26] proactive and responsive throughout the
[9:28] year to anything that can influence my
[9:30] family. Anything that's going to be um
[9:33] cause tend to worldliness in my home, in
[9:35] my personal life, in my life as a family
[9:37] as spouses make that decisions. Heads of
[9:39] household make that decision. We're
[9:41] being proactive about worldly influence.
[9:43] We're being responsive to worldly
[9:45] influence. And we say, "Hey, this is
[9:46] this is what I'm going to be doing this
[9:48] year. I'm not going to let down my
[9:50] guard. I'm not going to get lazy. I'm
[9:51] going to be proactive in these things.
[9:53] So, I hope that kind of recaptures where
[9:55] we were on sanctifying our homes. Now,
[9:58] to move to the next one was gather
[10:00] around the word. These are things like I
[10:01] can say are God's will for us this year
[10:03] to keep our home sanctified and then
[10:05] also as family to gather around the
[10:07] word. If I could put it this way, let
[10:09] the word take the place of the things
[10:11] that you move out.
[10:12] There's a stronghold and and you kick
[10:14] the devil out in one area. Uh move in
[10:17] with the things of God. Jesus teaches us
[10:19] about the man who has cast had devils
[10:21] cast out of him but nothing taken its
[10:23] place created a vacuum for worse things
[10:25] to come in. And so if we get rid of
[10:28] something uh then we ought to kind of
[10:30] use the mind to know what what can we
[10:32] move in here? What can we replace it
[10:33] with? And there's a I've heard from a
[10:36] number of parents that raised children
[10:38] in in the message all these many
[10:40] different decades and the different
[10:41] things that they've tried and things
[10:43] that have been successful. And I think
[10:45] that we can be uh we can recognize that
[10:47] for our children and for our young
[10:48] people, there are a lot of things that
[10:50] their peers in school and elsewhere are
[10:53] enjoying and have at home and have
[10:56] access to that we don't let them have
[10:58] access to and don't let them enjoy. And
[11:01] I think we should be uh especially
[11:02] sensitive to that that if there's things
[11:04] that we in their eyes they may feel that
[11:06] they're deprived of, we should find
[11:08] other things to fill their life up with
[11:11] uh to make home a happy place and to
[11:13] have things that they can pursue and
[11:14] things that they enjoy. And I think
[11:16] there's a lot of things that we can do
[11:17] even in the sense of of of fun and
[11:20] recreation that we can fill our
[11:22] children's lives up with. So it's not
[11:23] just always you don't do this, you don't
[11:25] do this, you don't do this. And so these
[11:27] are things that we can fill up our lives
[11:30] with or pl find a place in our life as
[11:33] we move things of the world out. And
[11:35] originally I was maybe going to have
[11:37] three things that we could say, but I
[11:39] took three things and condensed them
[11:40] down into one thing. Gather around the
[11:42] word. And that's pray together, read the
[11:43] Bible together, and listen to the word.
[11:45] These are those are three things part of
[11:47] this one. Gather around the word that we
[11:48] can do as family uh and we can do as
[11:51] individuals in our own homes. We pray,
[11:54] we read the Bible, and we can be
[11:56] listening to the message of the hour.
[11:58] Now, if we want to look at, if we could,
[12:00] Matthew chapter 6, um, we'll just read
[12:03] uh verse
[12:05] verse 6. It says, uh, but thou, when
[12:09] thou prayest,
[12:11] enter into thy closet, and when thou
[12:13] hast shut thy door, pray to thy father
[12:16] which is in secret, and thy father which
[12:18] seeth in secret shall reward thee
[12:20] openly. He's just told us that the
[12:22] hypocrites and we could say maybe he's
[12:23] calling out a specific sect of people
[12:25] whether it be the Pharisees and the
[12:27] Sadducees and different ones who had a
[12:30] very public way of expressing their
[12:31] religion so everyone knew who they were
[12:34] and what they did. And so he's
[12:36] identifying how there are those who
[12:38] prayed publicly so that everyone could
[12:40] hear it, everyone could see. But Jesus
[12:43] identifies a more intimate devotion to
[12:46] where we ought to have a place in home
[12:48] where we pray. And we could use that to
[12:50] emphasize a prayer closet or a place
[12:52] that we pray and we read our Bibles. But
[12:55] I want to just and this is just all I'm
[12:57] wanting to take from the scripture is
[12:59] Jesus identifying a discipline at home
[13:02] that's not public,
[13:04] that's not part of public worship,
[13:05] that's not part of a group or an
[13:07] assembly. And we gather here on a
[13:09] midweek service. We pray together. We
[13:11] sing. We listen to the word together. We
[13:13] read our Bibles together. And these are
[13:15] all things that we do together. And then
[13:17] these are also things that we should do
[13:20] at home. Uh that the praying and reading
[13:22] our Bibles and listening to the word of
[13:24] God are not exclusive to just coming to
[13:26] church, but these are things that we
[13:27] should also do at home. And it's
[13:30] important to do it at home. Otherwise,
[13:32] if there's no reinforcement, I I really
[13:34] feel this way that we're not reinforcing
[13:37] at home what we do at church. at church,
[13:40] we're reinforcing what we do at home.
[13:42] Like that's like the way remember
[13:44] brother Aaron likes to live to eat. And
[13:46] that's not healthy. And so we we don't
[13:48] go to church. We don't live to go to
[13:50] church. We go to church to live. And so
[13:52] at home, we're not reinforcing church
[13:54] principles at church. We're reinforcing
[13:55] home principles. And so we're supporting
[13:58] you in in your prayer life and you're
[14:00] reading your Bible and and getting into
[14:02] the message of the hour since it's
[14:03] available to us. a lot of things that
[14:05] we're doing uh to stimulate us and to
[14:07] encourage us to go home and to continue
[14:10] to do these right things. Now, I have uh
[14:13] maybe a dozen different statements here
[14:14] tonight from the message of the hour
[14:16] that I would like to use and just weave
[14:18] back in and out of different scriptures.
[14:20] And I feel I feel that there's a way
[14:22] that we could make this point in our own
[14:24] language and we could use our own uh
[14:26] anecdotal experiences. But I believe the
[14:28] language that is used by brother
[14:30] Brandham in the 50s and 60s has even
[14:32] more weight today because we see where
[14:35] we've gotten because the the failure to
[14:37] do these things.
[14:38] And so if we could look at it that way
[14:40] and I hope that has a lot of impact for
[14:41] you as we read this in the sermon the
[14:43] Queen of Sheba brother says a lot of
[14:45] people many people today church members
[14:47] Pentecostal people Baptist Presbyterians
[14:49] can tell you more about the movie life
[14:52] than they can the Bible life. Hm.
[14:57] Interesting.
[14:59] Could we have some breakout sessions on
[15:00] this and and talk about which movie life
[15:04] our children can talk about what we can
[15:05] talk about more and we can talk more
[15:07] about not just the movie life but a lot
[15:09] of other things. And we can talk more
[15:11] about certain things, certain
[15:13] entertainments and certain social things
[15:15] more than we can the Bible. And then I
[15:17] know the next phrase might m lose a lot
[15:19] of you. He says, "More children can tell
[15:20] you about Davy Crockett or Gunsmoke
[15:24] or some of them than they can about
[15:26] Jesus Christ."
[15:28] Now, I didn't take time to find the list
[15:30] of the top rated movies or TV shows, but
[15:33] uh you know what they are, the movie
[15:35] series, whether it be Avengers or Marvel
[15:38] or DC or all those different things that
[15:40] just have the repetitive cycle of things
[15:42] always be and and and our kids these
[15:45] days and maybe even our adults knowing
[15:46] more about the Star Wars timeline than
[15:48] they do the chronological chronology of
[15:50] the Bible.
[15:51] Like, where did Job happen? I don't
[15:53] know, but I can tell you the return of
[15:54] the Jedi is here, right? and they know
[15:57] more about these things than they do
[15:59] about the Bible. They know more about
[16:01] the that they can if if fill in the
[16:03] blank did one for uh Marvel movies,
[16:05] right? They wouldn't miss one of them,
[16:07] right? But when you ask about Bible uh
[16:11] uh verses, you ask about things in the
[16:12] message of the hour, it's much harder to
[16:14] do. Is this true?
[16:17] It's true. Now, we don't need to say,
[16:19] "Oh, I'm telling you it's the uh it's
[16:21] the Illuminati, right?" And get really
[16:23] deep conspiracy theory on this. No, it
[16:26] just happens because he says because
[16:28] that's what they're taught in their
[16:29] homes.
[16:30] So we we don't need to get real uh you
[16:32] know mysterious about it. Just hey, the
[16:34] reason why uh you our kids can tell us
[16:37] what the starting lineup is of the
[16:38] Washington Nationals or what the
[16:41] starting lineup is the of their AAA team
[16:44] is because these things they have access
[16:46] to it and they feed on it and they hear
[16:48] it and their minds grab a hold of it.
[16:51] because I know there was a time in my
[16:52] life where I felt like I knew everything
[16:54] about every sport team and I could uh uh
[16:56] you could tell who the starting pitchers
[16:58] were, you could tell who the backup
[16:59] quarterbacks were. And uh and nowadays I
[17:03] I have to ask Elliott like who's who's
[17:05] playing now? And it's not because it's
[17:08] not because I don't read the box scores
[17:09] and and haven't seen some of these
[17:11] things, but my mind just doesn't grab a
[17:13] hold of it like it used to. And so what
[17:15] you recognize then is our children just
[17:17] do it because of the access to it. It's
[17:20] just it's what they read. It's what they
[17:21] hear. And and I'll say this in defense
[17:23] of a lot our our children. A lot of
[17:25] these things they know isn't because
[17:27] they've sought it out themselves, but
[17:29] they it's by accident.
[17:31] They hear their classmates talking about
[17:33] they hear the commercials. They go
[17:34] somewhere and and they eat and it's
[17:36] always there's always sound bites.
[17:38] There's always images and they they know
[17:39] what's going on because there's so many
[17:41] things around. So it's not that they
[17:43] pursue it, but some of it's just
[17:44] secondhand smoke,
[17:47] right? They're getting a contact eye on
[17:49] the things of the world. They're not the
[17:50] one actually doing it, but they're
[17:52] around it and it gets in their head. If
[17:54] you could recognize this about your
[17:55] children, their minds will grab a hold
[17:58] of what they're hearing and what they're
[17:59] seeing. And so, if we can make sure they
[18:01] hear and see the right things, it gets
[18:03] there, too.
[18:05] He says it's because of what they're
[18:06] taught in their homes. They're taught
[18:08] more about and they have more access to
[18:11] these different uh entertainments and
[18:13] movie series and ideas and action
[18:15] figures and a and gaming ideas and these
[18:18] different things. They're there and
[18:19] they're available to them. I'm going to
[18:21] read in two places in Deuteronomy.
[18:22] Deuteronomy chapter 1 18 and 19. I'm
[18:26] aware that we have used these scriptures
[18:27] before in a similar context, but just as
[18:30] much as this is a year in preview, some
[18:32] of you could realize this is a year in
[18:34] review because we're going over some
[18:36] things we've gone over before.
[18:37] Therefore, shall you lay up these words
[18:39] in your heart and in your soul. So, they
[18:41] have to be there first for us parents.
[18:43] They have to be there first for us as
[18:44] believers. And he says, "Then bind them
[18:46] for a sign upon your hand that they may
[18:48] be as frontless between your eyes." What
[18:50] an image. This word that is in your
[18:52] heart, it ought to be it ought to be
[18:54] before you. Bind them for a sign upon
[18:56] your hand that they may be as frontless
[18:57] between your eyes. And ye shall teach
[18:59] them your children.
[19:01] So this is our responsibility as
[19:02] parents. This is the responsibility as
[19:04] heads of households. Speaking of them
[19:06] what things? These words that are in
[19:08] your heart and in your soul. speaking of
[19:10] them when thou sitest in thine house and
[19:12] when thou walkest by the way and when
[19:14] thou liest down and when thou riseth up
[19:17] and it's essentially used this language
[19:19] is used to essentially say all the time.
[19:22] If you say well just it's only when I'm
[19:24] sitting and only when I'm walking and
[19:25] when I'm lying and when I'm rising up so
[19:27] it's in the in between moments is when
[19:28] every when every other time is.
[19:31] But saying that you ought to have these
[19:32] occasions. It's always appropriate that
[19:34] there's we ought to have these times in
[19:36] our homes at these different moments
[19:38] where we speak about it and we talk
[19:39] about it and we lift it up and we refer
[19:41] to it and it's this word that is not
[19:43] only in our hearts and in our souls but
[19:45] we've bound it upon our hands as
[19:46] frontlets between our eyes so that it's
[19:48] ever present with us and a reminder of
[19:51] the things that matter.
[19:53] Brother Brandon in the sermon life story
[19:54] he says let me see what you read. Let me
[19:56] go in your office and in your house and
[19:58] see what you read. And I will tell you
[20:01] what you I'll tell about what you I will
[20:04] about tell you what you are. There we
[20:05] go. We got it. I will about tell you
[20:07] what you are. All based upon the things
[20:10] that have existence and place in your
[20:13] home and in your office. He said,
[20:14] "That's right." See, everything's with
[20:16] nature. So, there's some nature to it.
[20:18] So, we recognize that there's a
[20:20] influence. There's a nature that can
[20:21] tend a certain way. It's important for
[20:23] us to recognize this as born again
[20:25] believers that there's this this old
[20:27] nature that is is dead, but it almost
[20:30] exists as a shadow that's always there
[20:34] seeking to influence us. And and there's
[20:36] things can draw upon that and influence
[20:38] us in that way. And we've got to really
[20:39] keep our hearts and minds sanctified so
[20:42] these natures uh don't cause us to tend
[20:44] to wrong direction, especially for the
[20:45] sanctity of our children's minds. He
[20:47] says, "And you keep the Bible laying
[20:49] close for your children.
[20:52] I it's said in such a way to where maybe
[20:54] you don't need the Bible close. But he
[20:57] says you need to keep your Bible laying
[20:58] close for your children. Read it
[20:59] yourself. Be an example.
[21:02] That's what I didn't have in my younger
[21:04] life, but by God's grace, I want to put
[21:06] that before my children. And if there's
[21:08] another generation, may they put it
[21:09] before theirs. And I would say we're
[21:11] probably another generation beyond that
[21:13] where we need to be putting it before
[21:14] ours.
[21:15] Amen.
[21:15] There's something to be said. And I
[21:16] think I've given this demonstration
[21:18] perhaps here before where if you're
[21:20] reading your Bible or reading the
[21:22] message on your phone to the observer,
[21:23] you're not doing anything different than
[21:25] anybody else is doing.
[21:27] And that's why I believe it's really
[21:28] important, brother says, have the Bible
[21:30] laying open next to you. And I think
[21:32] that's an example that we can seek to
[21:33] have in our homes as we have something
[21:35] tangible, something physical that's
[21:37] representative of the word of God that
[21:39] our children see as important to us. I
[21:41] think if you put a Bible and a a cell
[21:43] phone before a toddler or a two-year-old
[21:45] and you just set it out there as a
[21:46] social experiment and let them go, watch
[21:48] which one they pick up, you know which
[21:51] one they're going to pick up,
[21:53] the one they see you handling the most,
[21:54] right?
[21:56] Because you're the one that's
[21:57] demonstrated to them what has interest,
[21:59] what has value. And so there's something
[22:01] to be said about the thing. Uh and you
[22:03] say over there and am I just have to
[22:04] carry my Bible every round around
[22:05] everywhere around with me? Well, I don't
[22:07] know. If you can, it might be a
[22:08] challenge, right? Get a Bible holster.
[22:10] Uh, get one of those cute little things
[22:12] on the back of your Bible so you can
[22:14] always hold it no matter what you're
[22:15] doing, right? I'm just over here
[22:18] cooking, right? But I got this little
[22:20] doohickey down here, right? That lets me
[22:23] keep hold on to my Bible. Think about
[22:24] all the things we we need to get a
[22:26] rugged armor case for our Bible, right?
[22:29] Does Otterbox make a a an eternal life
[22:31] case?
[22:34] But these are things that we can do to
[22:35] have close to us. And I said, it doesn't
[22:38] mean that you have to have it on your
[22:39] person at all times, but even if he just
[22:41] took these as junctures where when
[22:43] you're sitting down, when you're when
[22:44] you're lying down, when you're rising
[22:45] up, these moments where our thoughts and
[22:48] minds turn to what really matters
[22:50] and you give context to the day. Even
[22:52] when we go out on recreations as
[22:53] families or you enjoy certain things,
[22:55] whether it be some sport endeavor or or
[22:58] hiking, there should be times when
[22:59] before you hike, you pray together.
[23:00] Before you go do something, you pray
[23:02] about it. When you're done, maybe you
[23:03] give context to it. you've gone and
[23:05] you've had a um some volleyball
[23:06] tournaments at the park and then
[23:08] afterwards you you talk about
[23:10] competition and you talk about the
[23:12] things of God and you give context to it
[23:14] so that we're never far from the things
[23:16] that matter the most.
[23:17] That's right.
[23:18] Brother Bam said he didn't have that
[23:19] example in his younger life. He says, "I
[23:21] want to put that before my children."
[23:23] And and I think that if I could say this
[23:25] before we go further in this, I I'm I'm
[23:28] counting on you as believers to make the
[23:31] honest application in your life.
[23:33] And and and and by no means be carnal.
[23:36] By no means just be real strict and
[23:38] legalistic because I think if you do
[23:39] that, you can cause more damage.
[23:41] And and so I think these are things we
[23:42] ought to give great thought to. Ponder
[23:44] it may be a good word to use since we
[23:46] don't use that very often. Ponder on
[23:47] these things. Think about it. give some
[23:50] consideration to it and make the
[23:51] appropriate application,
[23:53] an honest application. It's revisited in
[23:56] Deuteronomy chapter 6:es 6-9. It says,
[23:58] "And these words which I command thee
[24:00] this day shall be in thine heart." This
[24:02] is the most important place for it to
[24:04] be. It's not good enough that it would
[24:05] be in the message. It's not good enough
[24:06] that it's on a few slides that I can
[24:08] present to you. If these things aren't
[24:10] in your heart, you're only going to go
[24:11] home and try to do what somebody else is
[24:13] telling you to do. But if these things
[24:15] can be a revelation to you, these things
[24:16] can be just stirred up in your mind and
[24:18] in your hearts. Then these things that
[24:20] are in your heart, you can do this. And
[24:22] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[24:24] thy children, and shalt talk of them
[24:25] when thou sitest in thy house, and when
[24:27] thou walst by the way, and when thou
[24:29] liest down, and when thou riseth up.
[24:31] Again, it's emphasizing these things are
[24:34] to be taught to our children, and be uh
[24:36] um we ought to be examples in these
[24:39] things for their sake. and thou shalt
[24:40] bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and
[24:42] they shall be as frontless between thy
[24:43] eyes, and thou shalt write them upon the
[24:45] post of thy house and on thy gates. To
[24:48] whatever extent they would have
[24:49] literally done this in order to cause
[24:52] themselves
[24:53] to be constantly reminded by of the word
[24:55] of God, we need to find a similar way
[24:57] where we are on some sort of rhythm and
[24:59] cadence with some sort of consistency
[25:02] and frequency bringing everything back
[25:04] to what matters. Amen.
[25:06] Remember the the major and a minor how
[25:09] that no matter where we where we end up
[25:11] on the scale, we want it to all come
[25:12] back to Christ eventually lead us right
[25:14] back to that key, that critical one,
[25:16] Christ. In the sermon, God testifying of
[25:18] his gifts, this is a much larger quote.
[25:20] I just for time sake, I'm just taking a
[25:22] piece out of it. He, brother says, I
[25:24] hope that in your home will at least one
[25:26] will read at least one chapter in the
[25:28] Bible every day and pray. Always do
[25:31] that. And that just gives you something
[25:33] really easy to to aim for something uh
[25:36] really I think simple to to account for
[25:40] that just in our homes read a chapter in
[25:42] the Bible every day and pray. Now I know
[25:45] what the tendency can be especially for
[25:46] those who are very sincere and this kind
[25:48] of quickens in their heart a and and
[25:50] they feel in their hearts oh you know
[25:52] this is something that I've let down.
[25:53] This is something that I could be doing
[25:55] a much better job in. and you kind of
[25:57] get the inspiration and then I think
[25:59] even if you get a little bit legalistic
[26:00] in it, you kind of find yourself uh
[26:03] wanting to uh you know to do this and so
[26:05] we're going to do this. We're going to
[26:06] read one chapter a night or at least one
[26:09] chapter every day and pray and you begin
[26:11] with Psalms 119,
[26:13] right? Because you're like we're going
[26:15] to we're going to make this count. Well,
[26:16] I I think that the idea is that to read
[26:20] your Bible and pray
[26:22] and to always do that,
[26:23] right? And I remember just by virtue of
[26:27] how um you know there's so much to be
[26:30] said about example and experience when
[26:32] we you start you begin to have a family
[26:35] and and you're very fervent in your own
[26:37] personal life. You love the Lord. You
[26:38] pray. You read your Bible and and for
[26:40] myself personally uh most of my time in
[26:43] the word would be uh is in studying and
[26:45] prayer for things for the people of God.
[26:47] And so there's always some a different
[26:49] kind of burden that's there than when
[26:50] I'm doing my own personal devotion. my
[26:52] wife herself had a very strong uh prayer
[26:54] life and personal devotion. A and then I
[26:57] found that in having kids reading your
[26:59] Bible and praying I had to kind of find
[27:01] the right approach because you take
[27:03] reading your Bible seriously you take
[27:05] prayer seriously and it was always this
[27:08] idea of trying to find the balance was
[27:10] like all right let's let's sit let's
[27:11] have family devotion and I want you to
[27:13] arrive 30 minutes early and pray right
[27:16] and you sit in your seats right and you
[27:18] you don't move because when we would
[27:20] kneel to pray the first instinct of all
[27:22] my kids you know under four years old
[27:24] was to climb on my back, right? That's
[27:27] the universal symbol of hop on when dad
[27:30] gets on his knees, right? And so there
[27:33] was times when you were you you had to
[27:35] resist that I grew through we grew
[27:36] through this as a family to where I
[27:38] recognized that the devotions it wasn't
[27:41] this time to uh you know get very very
[27:43] serious and create this atmosphere where
[27:45] we at any moment you know a whirlwind
[27:47] was going to come down a and and we
[27:50] would see the shikina glory but it was a
[27:52] way of introducing the things of God to
[27:54] your children and making a lasting
[27:56] impact. And I'll never forget how I was
[27:59] wrestling with just trying to find the
[28:01] right way to make it work. And uh
[28:02] Brother Chris, I think you were there
[28:04] and probably some others that may have
[28:05] been there as well, but we were at a a
[28:07] men's meeting in uh Tennessee, Carson
[28:10] Springs, Tennessee. It was a that
[28:12] bonfire devotion that Brother Mike Walls
[28:14] did and he's gather Mike, you were
[28:15] there. They a tremendous devotion uh
[28:18] that evening and he was just sitting
[28:19] around. He brings up family devotions.
[28:21] He says, "You know, when you do your
[28:22] family devotions, let the kids be kids.
[28:25] Let them climb on your back. Let them
[28:27] hop off the couch. You know, he says
[28:28] just it's don't make it all serious. Do
[28:31] it in a way that can really captivate
[28:32] their hearts. And it's life-changing
[28:34] event for me because I knew the
[28:37] importance and seriousness of it.
[28:38] Especially when brother says I, you
[28:40] know, I didn't have this example as a
[28:41] child. I want to put this example before
[28:43] my children. Uh family devotions, I was
[28:45] recognized it was very critical to keep
[28:47] our children balanced, to keep them
[28:49] connected with the things of God. And so
[28:51] this is when when that kind of clicked
[28:54] in my heart, there's a lot of things we
[28:55] begin to do as a family that made the
[28:58] devotions more engaging for where they
[29:00] were at that time. And these are things
[29:01] I I I think brother Brandham says it in
[29:03] such a simple way, an introductory
[29:05] elemental way that if you can just read
[29:08] your Bible and pray, that's good,
[29:10] right?
[29:11] It doesn't need a you don't need to do a
[29:13] full uh teaching on the seven church
[29:16] ages as a series. And I think that's
[29:18] something that we we're mindful of even
[29:20] in our Sunday school and even in our in
[29:22] our devotions that there's a way that
[29:24] we're wanting to captivate their minds
[29:25] about these things and we're not trying
[29:27] to take the place of uh of church. We're
[29:30] wanting to church to reinforce these
[29:31] things we're talking about at home. And
[29:33] there's a there's a basic way we can do
[29:35] this. And and in the sermon Elijah, he
[29:39] says talking about juvenile delinquency.
[29:41] It's a whole lot of parent delinquency.
[29:44] What the parents need today is to get
[29:46] some of them old beer cans out of the
[29:48] ice box out there. Take the cards off
[29:51] the table. And the church said,
[29:55] "Right, won't find none of them in my
[29:58] house."
[30:00] But you
[30:02] I think we mentioned this last
[30:03] Wednesday. Ask ourselves what has taken
[30:05] the place of the beer cans
[30:08] and the cards.
[30:10] Now, this isn't my chance to preach on
[30:12] Rockstar Energ energy drinks. I trust
[30:15] they're using a proper koozie to cover
[30:17] up the Monster label in front of your
[30:19] children. I I I this would not maybe
[30:23] have anything to do with Celsius or
[30:24] anything else like this, but just
[30:26] influences, right?
[30:28] The things that can intoxicate our minds
[30:30] and our bodies, the things that can
[30:31] stimulate us. And instead of it being
[30:34] beer cans and cards, maybe there is
[30:36] something that can have an applicable
[30:38] have an application in our homes. He
[30:40] says, "So get some things away and put
[30:42] the ri Bible, excuse me, the Bible right
[30:44] there and open it up and call the kids
[30:46] around and have prayer meeting." That's
[30:49] what we need today. Say this is what we
[30:52] need today is we need to have reading of
[30:54] the Bible in the home in praying in our
[30:56] home. what I'm what you say, well, if
[30:57] there's if there's if it's not clear by
[30:59] the end of the night, this is what I'm
[31:01] telling us that we could should do at
[31:02] home. Pray and read our Bibles together.
[31:05] Amen.
[31:06] That's it. I would maybe take it a step
[31:08] further and have that message plain on
[31:10] some way, somehow have that being uh uh
[31:12] have some opportunity in your home to
[31:14] lift up the voice of God in your homes.
[31:17] And we lift up the word of God by
[31:19] praying together. We lift up the word of
[31:20] God by reading to the Bible together in
[31:23] our home as family. This is something
[31:25] that we do in the book of Ephesians.
[31:28] Ephesians chapter 5 verses 14 to 20 as I
[31:32] as I run out of time here. I I'm going
[31:34] to lament the fact that I I won't I just
[31:36] I need I I want to share these things,
[31:38] but if I there's so much depth to these
[31:41] scriptures and I don't want them to be
[31:42] lost if we're we're very brief in
[31:44] touching on them. But he says,
[31:45] "Wherefore he saith, awake thou that
[31:46] sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
[31:48] Christ shall give thee light. See then
[31:50] that you walk circumspectly perfectly.
[31:54] Uh that's uh quite the goal. See then
[31:57] that you walk circumspectly not as fools
[31:59] but as wise. So the the the the proper
[32:02] manner in which to walk in order to try
[32:04] to achieve this uh to be circumspect
[32:07] would be to do it wisely not foolishly.
[32:10] He says redeeming the time because the
[32:12] days are evil. We can all agree and
[32:14] recognize that the days are evil. So
[32:16] there must be some redemption of our
[32:18] time, a redeeming of the time because of
[32:20] the evilness of the days. And Paul says
[32:23] it in Corinthians, 1 Corinthians, how
[32:26] that it remainth because time is short,
[32:28] we ought to give preference to the
[32:30] things of God. So he says, "Redeeming
[32:32] the time because the days are evil.
[32:34] Wherefore be not unwise, but
[32:37] understanding what the will of the Lord
[32:39] is." So in this way, we can apply our
[32:42] hearts to wisdom by knowing what the
[32:43] will of God is. in just these six things
[32:46] that we've been mentioning to you at the
[32:47] beginning of this year. These are things
[32:49] that are the will of God that we can be
[32:51] doing and these are ways things that we
[32:52] can have enforced inforce and things
[32:55] that we can be doing consistently and
[32:57] deliberately that achieve the will of
[32:59] God and speak of a wisdom. Be not unwise
[33:03] but understand what the will of the Lord
[33:04] is and be not drunk with wine wherein is
[33:06] excess. So there's your excessiveness,
[33:09] the lack of moderation, the things that
[33:11] stimulate our mind and our flesh, the
[33:12] things that intoxicate us and impair our
[33:14] judgment. That that's an image that we
[33:16] ought to have when we read that
[33:17] scripture. But be filled with the
[33:19] spirit, be animated by, be moved by, be
[33:22] encouraged by the spirit, speaking to
[33:25] yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[33:27] spiritual songs, singing and making
[33:30] melody in your heart to the Lord.
[33:32] This is what we can do at home. speaking
[33:35] to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[33:37] spiritual songs. These are things that
[33:38] we can do together. As it says, speak to
[33:40] yourselves. It's not talking to
[33:41] yourselves in the mirror. It's not just
[33:43] having a conversation with yourself, but
[33:44] among yourselves from father to child uh
[33:47] to spouse to spouse, speaking to
[33:49] yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[33:50] spiritual songs and then you singing and
[33:53] making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[33:55] Amen.
[33:55] This is a practice. This is a
[33:57] discipline. I I love to hear it. Some of
[33:59] you brothers express um how you have
[34:03] uh transit times and you have you have
[34:04] your time that you drive from the office
[34:07] uh to work or maybe you're on a route. I
[34:09] think brother Caleb, you're sharing it
[34:10] with me in his route. He's got he he
[34:12] drives a route all day long and he gives
[34:14] an opportunity to listen to sermon after
[34:16] sermon, message after message. And that
[34:18] commuting time is a time that some of us
[34:20] give to I know brother Mike Alderson
[34:22] listens to sermons of brother Brandon
[34:24] when he drives makes his commute and
[34:26] that's a wonderful time uh to to listen
[34:29] to the word of God and as it says here
[34:31] sing to yourself uh uh singing and
[34:33] making melt in your heart to the Lord.
[34:35] These are times that we I think they
[34:37] become fewer and fewer. It used to be
[34:40] that the the easiest thing we could grab
[34:41] a hold of to listen to uh to listen to
[34:44] when we drive was a tape, right? But now
[34:47] we've got podcasts galore, right? Audio
[34:50] book books galore. There's a lot of
[34:52] other things that just real easy to get
[34:54] a hold of and kind of get inside our
[34:55] minds like, whoa, this is really good. I
[34:57] could I could binge this. I think I'm
[34:58] going to miss my exit, right? I I'm
[35:01] going to be late to work. I got to
[35:02] finish this episode. So, there's a lot
[35:04] of things that just seem to be a little
[35:06] bit more enthusiastic than just reading
[35:08] the Bible, but I'm not telling you to
[35:11] purge your your your cue for your
[35:13] podcast, but maybe slip in a verse or
[35:16] two.
[35:16] Amen.
[35:17] As a starter
[35:20] and singing and and making melting your
[35:21] heart to the Lord, giving thanks always
[35:23] for all things unto God and the father
[35:24] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We
[35:26] can do this together as family. Then we
[35:29] have that personal discipline ourselves
[35:31] to do this. And the sermon, his wonders
[35:34] to perform.
[35:36] I if you're enjoying it, don't be afraid
[35:38] to just at least smile and just give a
[35:41] kind of a,
[35:43] you know, just even if you don't even
[35:44] say anything, just a
[35:46] I mean, I'll notice. I I I will I I
[35:48] might even kind of nod right back and
[35:50] kind of grin like, "Yeah, thank you.
[35:56] in his ser in the sermon his wonders to
[35:58] perform I know we read this last year he
[35:59] says the reason we don't have the
[36:01] spiritual blessings we can all finish
[36:03] this quote I think we have too much time
[36:05] to watch television
[36:06] that's good
[36:08] and too much time to read the newspapers
[36:10] or listen to something that we ought not
[36:12] to be listening to and I'm so glad he
[36:13] got very general with it because a lot
[36:16] of us uh fortunately don't have TVs in
[36:19] our home anymore but we have more on our
[36:22] screens than they did in the day when
[36:24] brother was calling it television.
[36:26] So, it's a reminder. We have too much
[36:28] time for television, too much time to
[36:29] read newspapers and not listening to the
[36:31] things and listening to the things that
[36:32] we ought not to be listening to. And
[36:33] we're not redeeming the time, but we're
[36:35] giving it to the things of the world
[36:36] instead of our time to the Lord Jesus.
[36:39] There ought to be a giving of our time
[36:41] to the things of the Lord Jesus. I'm not
[36:43] going to meddle in your lives and tell
[36:45] you that you just go ahead and email me.
[36:47] Share with me your Spotify playlist and
[36:49] share with me your podcast playlist and
[36:51] give me an opportunity to go through
[36:53] your media library and I'll tell you
[36:54] what's right and what's wrong and I'll
[36:56] I'll run an algorithm with the help of
[36:57] some of these brothers and we'll come up
[36:59] with an application that'll spit out the
[37:01] proper mix and the proper balance of
[37:03] freconomics and the sermons that brother
[37:06] Brandham preached. And and that's not
[37:08] what we're going to do.
[37:09] This is something that there's got to be
[37:11] a hunger in your heart. Amen.
[37:13] There's got to be some point in your
[37:14] life where you step back and say, you
[37:15] know, I'm kind of tired of being
[37:17] depressed.
[37:18] And so maybe I'll start to listen to
[37:20] something that'll lighten my spirit a
[37:21] little bit.
[37:22] A and and and get away from all the true
[37:24] crime podcasting a
[37:26] and listen to the truth podcasting of
[37:28] the message of the hour, reading our
[37:30] Bibles and praying. And so it's got to
[37:32] be a desire in your heart to do it.
[37:34] Something that you can do, a change that
[37:35] you can make and give your time to the
[37:38] things of God instead of all of it to
[37:41] the world.
[37:42] The world takes enough of it,
[37:44] right? And it'll take all of it if we
[37:46] give it a chance. So, let's fight to
[37:48] give place to God and to his word in our
[37:51] lives.
[37:52] In the sermon, the seal of the
[37:54] Antichrist, he says, "We have time for
[37:56] everything else. No time for prayer
[37:58] meetings." Here, here's a real pleasant
[38:00] phrase. The home's all butchered up.
[38:04] I was cutting meat the other day,
[38:06] preparing it, and I said, "I am
[38:07] butchering this meat."
[38:10] He's doing a good job.
[38:13] The home's all butchered up and the
[38:14] girls and the and boys are out are out
[38:17] going around. And what just struck me in
[38:19] this is how everything I think I'm
[38:22] actually that's another statement I'm
[38:23] going to read here in a moment. But
[38:25] notice how he says the home's all cut
[38:26] up, butchered up, boys are out going
[38:28] around. And what he's kind of looking at
[38:30] is this this fragmenting, this
[38:32] separation
[38:34] uh larking around over the country and
[38:36] mothers and fathers unconcerned. And yet
[38:39] message
[38:41] He says Pentecostal, but I think we
[38:42] ought to put ourselves in this. He says,
[38:44] "What we need tonight is a home altar in
[38:46] the house. A place where God where God
[38:48] where the Bible's read and children are
[38:50] taught the word of the living God." A
[38:52] place in the house.
[38:54] He doesn't just call the children back
[38:56] home. He doesn't he's not just
[38:57] castigating the parents, but he's saying
[38:59] in in the likelihood that the girls are
[39:02] going to run off and do this, the guys
[39:03] going to run off and do that, the
[39:04] children are going to be teenagers and
[39:06] they're all going to have their thing to
[39:07] do, bouncing around from place to place,
[39:09] at least have something in the home
[39:11] where we all come back to and gather
[39:13] around it. He calls it a home altar.
[39:15] Maybe we heard the phrase the family
[39:16] altar. A place where the Bible is read
[39:18] and children are taught the word of the
[39:20] living God. You should have that in your
[39:23] home,
[39:25] sir. That's not old-fashioned. It may
[39:27] have been done in oldfashioned days, but
[39:29] what I like to see are more throwback
[39:31] Christians,
[39:33] more vintage Christians. I love it in my
[39:35] life as I've gone through and traveled
[39:37] when I come in contact with what I call
[39:38] throwback believers. And they're young
[39:41] families, just young uh raising
[39:43] children, but they have this vintageness
[39:45] about them to where they want to apply
[39:46] the token. They want to have family
[39:48] devotions. They want to read their
[39:49] Bible. They're very leerary about the
[39:51] things of the world. They're watchful
[39:52] over what their children have. they they
[39:54] don't just let their children have um
[39:56] some of them don't even let their kids
[39:58] have screens at all or some of them are
[39:59] very careful about the access they have
[40:01] to screens. I love that kind of
[40:03] throwback idea about influences.
[40:07] Amen.
[40:07] But let's say that we ought to at least
[40:09] have a place where God has preeminence
[40:12] where the Bible's read and children are
[40:13] taught the word of the living God.
[40:15] Amen.
[40:16] Gathering around the word is a means of
[40:19] sanctifying our minds.
[40:21] Refocusing our goals I think is It's a
[40:24] recalibration.
[40:26] I think I think brother Michael Jenkins
[40:27] shared the phrase with me, fine-tuning
[40:30] in a way that we come back. Anything
[40:32] that's used frequently needs to be
[40:34] tuned.
[40:35] And our minds and our hearts and our
[40:37] emotions and everything are frequently
[40:39] used throughout the day. There should be
[40:40] some coming back to the things of God
[40:42] just to be tuned, be retuned.
[40:46] I know this scripture has a lot of depth
[40:48] to it and maybe would be is appropriate
[40:52] in a little bit different context, but I
[40:54] think it has some application in James
[40:55] chapter 4:8, "Draw nigh to God and he'll
[40:57] draw nigh to you."
[40:59] Brother Bam talked about when we we talk
[41:00] about everything else, talk about who's
[41:02] going to be the next president. We talk
[41:03] about this, we talk about that. He says,
[41:04] "But when we talk about him, he comes
[41:05] near.
[41:06] Draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to
[41:08] you." And this thought to me in having
[41:11] some sort of devotion and consecration
[41:13] and place where the word is lifted up
[41:15] says, "Cleanse your hands, ye sinners,
[41:16] and purify your hearts, ye double-
[41:18] minded." Just the thrust of that being
[41:20] to the double-minded. Maybe one who is a
[41:22] sinner, one who has divided loyalties in
[41:25] their soul and has not yet received the
[41:26] Holy Ghost. It still spoke to me that
[41:29] there is a there's a process as a
[41:31] believer that we can draw nigh to him,
[41:34] cleanse our hands, and purify our
[41:36] hearts. Maybe we're not doing it as
[41:38] sinners, but we recognize that we are
[41:40] trying to keep our child's heart, the
[41:42] hearts of our children clean. We have a
[41:45] responsibility a as dressers of their
[41:47] vineyards. We have the responsibility to
[41:49] watch out over their spirits because you
[41:51] are determining just how much is going
[41:54] to be in their spirits when God begins
[41:56] to deal with it. when their hearts and
[41:58] minds are at that stage where they ought
[42:00] to be making decisions for the Lord,
[42:02] you're going to have some responsibility
[42:03] for all the barriers and all the rocks
[42:06] and all the weeds and all the scars and
[42:08] all the complexes that the spirit has to
[42:10] deal with and root through in order for
[42:12] that word to penetrate. So, we ourselves
[42:14] will draw nigh to God knowing that he'll
[42:16] draw nigh to us. And then it in that
[42:19] process, it cleanses our hands and
[42:20] purifies our hearts. And by God's grace,
[42:23] we're creating a sanctification and a
[42:26] barrier of protection for the tender
[42:28] hearts of our children that are in our
[42:29] homes.
[42:31] Brother Brandham says in the sermon, the
[42:32] meanest man in Santa Maria, what a great
[42:35] title,
[42:37] the meanest man in Santa Maria. He says,
[42:39] you think of the modern American people.
[42:41] And he did preach it in Santa Maria. So
[42:43] it wasn't just like this weird outlier
[42:45] in Jeffersonville where he's you know
[42:47] you know getting really specific about
[42:49] some guy he ran into in Santa Maria but
[42:51] says you think of the modern American
[42:53] people. What is it? Well dad's down at
[42:55] the pool room and all us dad said
[42:59] right cuz none of us are at the pool
[43:01] room. We just brought it into our
[43:02] basement. I'm just kidding. Um we don't
[43:05] have basements in Phoenix.
[43:08] Uh but he says dad's down at the pool
[43:10] room. The idea is, notice, everyone has
[43:12] their own thing they're doing.
[43:14] Dad's down at the pool room. Mother's
[43:16] out with a some pet society somewhere on
[43:18] the beach stretched out. Daughter's down
[43:20] at the canteen or down at the rock and
[43:22] roll. Junior's got his hot rod out on
[43:24] the street.
[43:27] There you are. One, get a hamburger.
[43:30] There's no home life, no prayer life.
[43:33] He's he's picturing this scene. I think
[43:35] the maybe was one of the artists here or
[43:38] brother Joel this is something you could
[43:39] submit to one of those art generators
[43:40] the a the artificial intelligent just
[43:43] put all these phrases in there and see
[43:44] what kind of art it kicks out and that's
[43:47] the picture brother Brandham's trying to
[43:48] create
[43:50] if you imagine the dad's doing one thing
[43:52] the mom's doing another daughter's doing
[43:53] one thing the son's doing another and
[43:55] they're all just kind of off doing their
[43:57] own thing and maybe he picks things that
[43:58] we might say hey you shouldn't be at the
[44:00] canteen you shouldn't be at the pool
[44:01] room you know a mom shouldn't be
[44:02] stressed out on the beach junior
[44:04] shouldn't be on his hot rod on the
[44:05] street. All these different things we
[44:06] might say, but we all have our different
[44:08] games we play, things we listen to. And
[44:11] it's one of the things I I think there's
[44:13] a there's an upside to it. But one thing
[44:14] I'm very very sensitive to in our family
[44:17] is how we can just all have earbuds in.
[44:19] And so we can all be in the same room,
[44:21] but we're all listening to something
[44:22] totally different, experiencing
[44:24] something different. And that's how
[44:25] we're all alone together anymore.
[44:28] That's how loneliness can persist in our
[44:30] youth groups because we all have this we
[44:32] have this separate hidden life. So that
[44:34] when we're with one another, we're not
[44:35] really c present with one another. Our
[44:37] minds are thinking about the social
[44:39] circles. Our minds are thinking about
[44:40] this game. Our mind is thinking about
[44:42] this person and that person. And we're
[44:44] really we're together, but we're alone
[44:45] because we're not connecting because we
[44:47] haven't found the touch points. We don't
[44:49] share the same ideals. We don't have
[44:51] share the same enthusiasm for the right
[44:53] things. And so the picture that's
[44:55] painting here is in a family, everyone's
[44:57] off doing their own thing. And he when
[45:00] he alludes to one, get a hamburger. One
[45:03] of the things that we could say that is
[45:05] definitely becoming less and less common
[45:07] is the family meal time.
[45:10] And I know that's maybe um an evolution
[45:12] that takes place as families grow and
[45:14] children uh as they get into their
[45:15] teenage years and maybe they have jobs
[45:17] and they have school. But while we have
[45:19] the time, let's take the time to sit
[45:22] down together.
[45:24] Amen.
[45:24] The family meal is a wonderful time.
[45:26] It's it's a time usually traditionally
[45:28] where you'd catch up on your day and you
[45:30] talk to one another and you could share
[45:31] your feelings and you could have that
[45:33] camaraderie. But sometimes it's just eat
[45:35] so fast and get up and everyone return
[45:37] to their own little rooms or you could
[45:39] even just go ahead and put the label
[45:40] over the rooms. One's the pool room,
[45:42] one's the beach, one's the street, one's
[45:44] the canteen, right? They all just
[45:46] disappear. He says there's no home life.
[45:49] He says no prayer life. What is he
[45:50] alluding to? There's no family altar.
[45:54] There's no time to get together and
[45:56] where the word is the rallying point.
[45:58] Amen.
[45:59] Where you're it's a kind of let's all
[46:02] come together. Let's all put our devices
[46:05] aside. Let's all come together for a
[46:06] little bit and lift up the word where
[46:08] it's something that's valued, something
[46:09] that's pursued.
[46:11] And if I could say this, if if I'm if
[46:14] it's coming across in in a particular
[46:16] way to you where it's just not
[46:18] resonating with you, like even what my
[46:21] you know, what's his point? Is this
[46:22] still that same old legalistic
[46:23] clothesline way that we hear these
[46:25] things talked about? Um, I think that,
[46:28] you know, there's definitely a
[46:29] scarecrow, right? There there's a
[46:32] scarecrow when it comes to holiness.
[46:34] There's a scarecrow when it comes to
[46:35] applying the token. But just know that a
[46:38] scarecrow is only put up somewhere
[46:41] where there's actually life.
[46:43] There's actually something that can be
[46:45] taken. And scarecrows only scarecrows.
[46:48] Come on.
[46:50] So, as eagles,
[46:53] don't let any scarecrow keep you from
[46:54] this.
[46:55] Amen.
[46:56] You you get in you get into it and find
[46:57] the balance for yourself. You find the
[46:59] application in your home life. You find
[47:00] it in your own personal life. If you're
[47:01] living on your own, uh in your family
[47:03] life as you have the responsibility as a
[47:05] parent, these are things that we can do.
[47:07] And I if I could put it this way, if
[47:09] there's a this is what was in my mind,
[47:11] if the emphasis is somehow being lost or
[47:13] you're not sure where I'm coming from or
[47:15] to what extent you know what's is it an
[47:18] all or nothing proposition, brother
[47:20] Aaron, because there can only be two
[47:21] influences. I know there's a lot of ways
[47:23] our minds can begin to work. But let me
[47:24] just put it this way. It's necessary.
[47:27] And the reason why we find it in the
[47:28] word of God, and brother Brandham
[47:29] emphasizes it so often, reading our
[47:31] Bibles, praying, listening to the word
[47:33] of God, is necessary as a counterweight
[47:36] to the influence of the world.
[47:39] It's necessary even as like a counter
[47:41] measure as a a counter influence to
[47:44] worldly influence.
[47:46] Because the worldly influence is going
[47:47] to be there, the worldly things are
[47:49] going to be there. The worldly
[47:50] opportunities are going to be there. We
[47:51] have to accept that in the society that
[47:53] we live in today, some way, somehow,
[47:56] worldly things are going to find their
[47:58] way into our minds and do before our
[48:00] eyes and the things we say and do,
[48:02] they're going to have some access to it.
[48:04] No matter how hard you try uh to keep it
[48:06] out, there's going to be some way that
[48:08] our children and even ourselves are
[48:10] going to experience and maybe
[48:11] participate in things that have a wrong
[48:13] kind of influence. And so what we need
[48:16] is to have a discipline of having a
[48:19] counter counterweight to that
[48:23] that you can't you apply for a job and
[48:25] they they say well you know the hours
[48:27] are 9 to5 and you got to have an office
[48:28] and it's a kind of an open air cubicle
[48:30] area and you're like well just so
[48:32] everyone knows I'm going to be playing
[48:34] I'm going to be playing brother Donnie
[48:36] Reagan you know from 9 to5 just so
[48:39] everybody knows because I want to keep
[48:40] those conversations about worldly things
[48:42] at a minimum. I don't want to overhear
[48:44] uh uh you know, Taylor Swift coming out
[48:46] from that person's earbuds and I don't
[48:47] want to hear this and I and you say,
[48:49] "Well, that's just not gonna work.
[48:52] You're not going to be able to shout
[48:53] down the world. You're not going to be
[48:54] able to to to completely uh uh you're
[48:57] not going to be able to control every
[48:59] atmosphere and environment that you're
[49:00] in as a believer. I, you know, some of
[49:02] the people I think about who are very
[49:04] very legalistic about some of these
[49:05] things are the ones that have the
[49:07] biggest blowups,
[49:08] right? because they spend all their time
[49:10] in a war of attrition trying to keep the
[49:12] world out instead of recognizing, you
[49:14] know what, the devil's going to be ever
[49:15] present trying to get inside my head.
[49:17] But what I'm going to have is I'm going
[49:18] to have a discipline of counter having a
[49:20] countermeasure to that in washing my
[49:23] spirit with the word of God.
[49:25] And that's what I want these things to
[49:26] be is not it's not this uh in the
[49:29] presence of a vacuum of being able to
[49:31] get rid of anything that's Disney
[49:32] ccentric in my home and just it's a
[49:35] matter of knowing that these things are
[49:37] around. Should we not give God place as
[49:39] a means of washing our spirits?
[49:41] Amen.
[49:45] As it says in 1 Corinthians 7:31, "And
[49:47] they that use this world is not abusing
[49:49] it.
[49:51] For the fashion of this world passeth
[49:52] away." Paul is talking to those and he's
[49:54] using a language to say that because the
[49:56] time is short, it remainth that they
[49:58] that have wives be as though they have
[49:59] none. And he gives the principle. Why?
[50:02] because the times or days are evil and
[50:04] it's such a difficult terrible time that
[50:06] it's you you cannot care for the things
[50:08] of the world how you can please your
[50:10] spouse but you've got to put God first
[50:12] that's kind of the emphasis here in this
[50:13] chapter and then he's talking he
[50:15] continues and say they that use the
[50:17] world and that that speaks to those who
[50:20] have who have the world and have access
[50:23] to the world and those that have
[50:24] abundance of certain things and those
[50:26] that have I think it speaks perfectly to
[50:28] Leodysia it's saying you that have the
[50:30] world you have money you have amenities,
[50:32] you have technologies, you have things
[50:34] that you can use and you that have to
[50:36] use the world, don't abuse it.
[50:39] Speaks of the overuse or the lack of
[50:41] moderation of worldly enjoyments. He
[50:42] says, "Don't abuse it." And and if I
[50:45] could say it this way, the abuse
[50:48] isn't in hurting the device, but the
[50:50] abuse is because it hurts you.
[50:53] Where there's abuse, there's pain that's
[50:54] being inflicted. So, we can use things
[50:56] to our own detriment. There's a point
[50:58] where we use it, but there's a tipping
[50:59] point where now it becomes abusive to
[51:01] our own spirits. It becomes abusive to
[51:03] our families. They that use the world,
[51:05] don't abuse it. We may use it, but don't
[51:08] take your fill of it.
[51:10] Let's not get our fill of the world.
[51:12] Let's have that uh that response as they
[51:14] talk about the certain receptors in a in
[51:17] a person's gut when they're eating. Some
[51:18] of us just eat way too fast and it
[51:20] doesn't give a chance for our receptors
[51:22] in our body to say, "You're full. That's
[51:23] enough."
[51:24] Stretch receptors, is that the one we're
[51:26] talking about? And and so there's a way
[51:28] that we need to have kind of our really
[51:30] healthy and robust and active and primed
[51:33] uh stretch receptors that know this is
[51:35] enough.
[51:36] Enough's enough. This it's time to put
[51:38] it down. It's time because we don't want
[51:40] to get our fill of the things of the
[51:42] world.
[51:43] And I would love to become be get very
[51:45] very very specific with you.
[51:49] And I think again though these are
[51:51] things that you have to be
[51:54] uh mindful of,
[51:56] but there's so many things I'm pondering
[52:00] that could be used as um specific
[52:02] examples. But these social environments
[52:05] that and and I say social environment
[52:07] just to talk about what our typical uh
[52:10] day would look like in terms of things
[52:12] that we interact with and the things
[52:13] that we used. But our environments are
[52:16] just designed to stimulate our pleasure
[52:18] center.
[52:20] They've even they've gified the shopping
[52:24] experience,
[52:25] right? to where you want to get your
[52:27] fuel points.
[52:29] A
[52:30] and and they and they've gified so many
[52:33] different normal everyday things that we
[52:35] would just normally do, but now there's
[52:37] a badge to be won,
[52:39] right? And now there's a check-ins to be
[52:41] done and there's certain certain things
[52:43] that you have to do to get the stars, to
[52:45] get the points, and it's a gamifying of
[52:47] just daily normal activities. And what
[52:49] it speaks to is how that just about
[52:51] everything that we engage in anymore has
[52:54] some sort of element of trying to
[52:56] stimulate the pleasure center so that
[52:58] you keep coming back to it.
[53:00] And that's the idea behind a lot of
[53:02] social media platforms. They want to do
[53:04] them in such a way where there's this
[53:05] repetitive uh checking back and punching
[53:09] and subscribing and clicking and
[53:11] following and tapping and swiping.
[53:12] There's a way that they want it to be
[53:14] triggering this sense of reward and
[53:16] earning incentives while you engage in
[53:18] it. And it's all because of the way that
[53:20] the human mind works and then capitalism
[53:23] recognizing capitalism recognizing it,
[53:26] right?
[53:27] And and and using it to our own
[53:29] detriment.
[53:31] And the they find this is where I could
[53:33] just demonstrate this on a number of
[53:35] levels, but video games
[53:38] trigger an addictive response in the
[53:41] mind.
[53:42] You all listening?
[53:43] Video games
[53:46] have the same trigger the same response
[53:48] in your mind as a cocaine addiction.
[53:52] And the cocaine addicts get quiet real
[53:54] quick.
[53:57] Has the same trigger. Listen, think
[53:59] about it. Playing video games, right?
[54:02] Just on my phone having some fun with my
[54:04] thumbs, right?
[54:06] And it's going to trigger fires the same
[54:07] neurons in your mind as a person who's
[54:09] addicted to cocaine.
[54:11] And right, just think about all the fun
[54:13] things we'd have to say about brother so
[54:14] and so if we found out he was a crack
[54:16] addict, right?
[54:18] We would vilify him and run him out of
[54:20] town. And you're over there going, "Man,
[54:22] I can't wait till I can get home, play
[54:23] some Clash Corral." Right? And you're
[54:27] doing the same thing about video games.
[54:29] I know you're laughing, but it ain't
[54:31] funny
[54:32] because that's how it's work. That's how
[54:34] it works these days. Our mini devices,
[54:36] our iPads, our cell phones, our
[54:39] Androids, our Blackberries, you name it,
[54:42] have got us in a pickle of addiction.
[54:45] And it's these soft addictions where
[54:47] it's just, oh, it just starts out ever
[54:49] so innocently, right? It starts out it's
[54:51] like, ah, you know what's $9.99 for a
[54:53] new box, right? Or whatever it is,
[54:55] crate, whatever they're called. I think
[54:56] my kids are getting on me because I
[54:57] didn't know what it was called. Bin,
[54:58] crate, shuttle, bag, whatever it is. And
[55:01] what you I just it' just be it' just be
[55:03] 10 bucks, right? What's $10, right? But
[55:07] before you know it, you don't have any
[55:08] filter anymore.
[55:10] Because you're acting like someone who
[55:12] you you're you are literally addicted to
[55:14] it.
[55:16] And you don't think about that when you
[55:17] got to watch the next episode. You don't
[55:19] think about that when you've got to
[55:20] watch the next u the sequel. You don't
[55:22] think about that when you've got to fire
[55:23] up the game. But it's happening to us.
[55:27] And soft addictions become hard
[55:28] addictions through these incentives. And
[55:30] it's in the apps, it's in the games,
[55:32] it's in the movies, it's in the
[55:33] television series, it's all in there as
[55:35] that hook just to keep pulling you
[55:37] through.
[55:38] Haven't you ever noticed it, some of you
[55:40] who've been watching that those soap
[55:42] operas for the last 40 years, that the
[55:44] drama never resolves itself, right?
[55:48] There's never, you know, there's never,
[55:50] it's not like the country song where in
[55:52] the end you finally get your wife back,
[55:53] your dog back. Wait, no, that's if you
[55:54] play it backwards. But there's there
[55:56] it's not like there's something resolves
[55:58] itself. Oh, finally they won or it
[56:02] happened. There's always and you know it
[56:04] stops, right? And next time on and
[56:07] you're like I've got to wait till next
[56:10] season.
[56:12] It's a hook.
[56:14] It's a hook.
[56:15] I want you to really really give some
[56:17] weight and thought to this. Brother Bram
[56:19] says in the message on Certain Sound
[56:20] because you might think, "Ah, well
[56:21] that's really cute, Brother Aaron. make
[56:23] good stand up at a youth meeting. Um,
[56:26] but I want you to think seriously about
[56:27] it because in the sermon uncertain
[56:28] sound, he says home life is uncertain.
[56:31] Now, just catch the image of this. A man
[56:34] can marry a nice little woman, get her
[56:36] back out of the country here where she's
[56:38] not polluted. So, I think we ought to be
[56:39] thinking about he's somebody who has not
[56:41] been exposed, right? There's no
[56:44] internet, there's no television, there's
[56:46] no cell coverage, whatever. You just
[56:48] find somebody out in the middle of
[56:49] nowhere who's not polluted. take her
[56:51] into home and set a television in there
[56:53] and the first thing you know you come
[56:55] home and she's acting like some of these
[56:56] movie stars.
[56:58] It's just the principle of influence.
[57:00] It's the principle of what you set
[57:01] before you. It's the principle of what
[57:03] is centered a and what they have
[57:05] opportunity to feed on. Here's one who
[57:07] never had any any influences and a
[57:10] particular upbringing and you set her
[57:11] before the television. Set her before
[57:13] the things that are projecting images
[57:15] that has an influence behind it. says
[57:18] it's just a matter of time before she's
[57:19] acting like the movie stars,
[57:21] right?
[57:21] And she doesn't have a history of it.
[57:23] It's just the nature of the influence.
[57:26] And so we we say, "Well,
[57:29] like we we we're all grown up in the
[57:31] city, right? You we're here. We're here
[57:33] in the big city. At least we come to the
[57:34] big city for church and and we're being
[57:36] exposed and we go to public school and
[57:38] we have our cell phones, we have
[57:39] devices, we have all these things around
[57:41] us. So maybe it's too late just to keep
[57:42] us out in the country somewhere and keep
[57:44] us from being polluted. So then we ought
[57:46] to just kind of recognize, whoa,
[57:49] think about all these influences and who
[57:51] am I acting like,
[57:53] right? I I notice it in my boys that
[57:55] whenever they score a touchdown or they
[57:57] they dunk on the six-foot goal when they
[57:58] lower it all the way that there there's
[58:00] there's there's certain things they do,
[58:03] right? It's a shame when we see our
[58:05] young people doing the gritty after they
[58:07] score a touchdown, but they've seen the
[58:09] image before them, right? They've seen
[58:11] it. They they they they pick up on it
[58:14] and then all it takes is for one of you
[58:16] who was all up on TikTok doing the
[58:18] latest fad dance to do it at church
[58:21] before somebody else is doing it and
[58:22] they have no idea what they're doing. I
[58:25] was even told that a pastor was flossing
[58:27] on the platform cuz he didn't know what
[58:29] it was.
[58:32] And these are things that get that
[58:34] influence.
[58:37] YouTube celebrities, all the trends that
[58:39] we see on Tik Tok, the Instagram
[58:40] influencers, whatever they call them,
[58:42] the gaming personalities, and oh, you
[58:44] just want to enjoy this, we want to
[58:45] participate in this, we want to enjoy
[58:47] these things. But it becomes an
[58:48] influence.
[58:51] And you say, well, whatever happened to
[58:53] your series on the year in preview?
[58:57] I'm on it right now.
[58:59] Maybe it's a little bit of review for
[59:00] some of us. And what we're wanting to do
[59:02] is think be forward looking like all
[59:04] right that kind of gives some context to
[59:06] what 2020 became and 21 2021 turned
[59:09] into. So let's kind of half take a half
[59:11] step or do a take a a corrective measure
[59:14] and recognize these influences that
[59:16] cause us to begin to act. Us as adults,
[59:19] not even just our children, but we as
[59:20] adults start mimicking and pariting the
[59:23] things that we feed on.
[59:25] And so with time being so short, it's
[59:27] critical that we find time to gather
[59:29] around the word of God.
[59:31] doing these things at home. And I
[59:32] believe as I've
[59:35] used some modern references and language
[59:38] that's very particular, I want you to
[59:41] recognize that praying and reading our
[59:43] Bibles, listening to the message of the
[59:45] hour will become an an important
[59:48] protection against the influence and the
[59:51] excess of the world.
[59:54] because I I might have my own personal
[59:56] convictions on some of these things and
[59:58] I might have a particular standard that
[1:00:00] I would want to hold in my home and and
[1:00:03] I could try to get all of you to
[1:00:05] whatever if if we have these kind of
[1:00:07] games or we watch these kind of movies.
[1:00:08] I could try to just kind of get this
[1:00:10] baseline. We're all doing the same
[1:00:11] thing. But I think what would be better
[1:00:13] is to point you to the word
[1:00:15] and start giving that place
[1:00:17] and giving that an opportunity. And I
[1:00:20] believe you'll find that the appetite
[1:00:21] your children give to worldly things,
[1:00:23] they can begin to give towards things of
[1:00:24] the word.
[1:00:25] Amen.
[1:00:28] Let me close on this
[1:00:30] lengthy quote from the sermon
[1:00:32] fellowship.
[1:00:34] Says, "Job, I think about Job that day
[1:00:36] as a dad. He had a bunch of children.
[1:00:38] They were kind of weward and he was
[1:00:40] always thinking of his children.
[1:00:42] Wouldn't it be a lot better if all the
[1:00:44] church members of Chicago had the same
[1:00:46] kind of an idea about their city? you
[1:00:49] wouldn't have no juvenile delinquency.
[1:00:50] You wouldn't see these riots and things
[1:00:52] that they have here today, shooting,
[1:00:53] killing, stealing, rape, and all these
[1:00:55] things. It's because the people are
[1:00:58] unconcerned about their children.
[1:01:02] The first thing they say, "Well, I'll
[1:01:04] put them on the cradle roll when they're
[1:01:06] little." Turn the rest over to the
[1:01:07] Sunday school teacher. Cradle roll, I
[1:01:10] think, has different applications and
[1:01:11] denominations, but put on one when
[1:01:13] you're baptized or dedicated, different
[1:01:14] things. They put all the little kids on
[1:01:16] a a registry at the church. He says,
[1:01:18] "Just turn it over to the Sunday school
[1:01:19] teacher and her out at a dance maybe all
[1:01:22] night. Come in fixed up like some she's
[1:01:24] going to a circus instead of a church
[1:01:26] and put your children in the hands of
[1:01:28] something like that." Mother's shame on
[1:01:29] you. He's talking about the even the
[1:01:31] Sunday school teacher failing to have
[1:01:34] the right kind of influence. And he
[1:01:35] says,
[1:01:37] "You ought
[1:01:39] to put that child that's in need down
[1:01:42] there and read the Bible.
[1:01:45] Lay your hands over on their head. call
[1:01:46] out to God, God be merciful. Spare my
[1:01:50] daughter, my son.
[1:01:52] I'll never forget maybe one of the first
[1:01:54] times just that I saw a mother pray with
[1:01:56] her children. I was with, it was here in
[1:01:58] Phoenix, maybe it was Poria with brother
[1:02:00] John Andes. We're going back a long
[1:02:03] time. And uh Sister Sharon Andy's was
[1:02:06] putting uh
[1:02:10] putting the two boys to bed and she just
[1:02:12] took them and begin to pray. Pray with
[1:02:14] them a prayer over them. Such a powerful
[1:02:17] prayer. And that's that's the image.
[1:02:20] That's the image that Brother Bram's
[1:02:21] referring to that we would take our
[1:02:23] children, we pray over them, call out to
[1:02:25] God, God, be merciful, spare my son,
[1:02:27] spare my daughter. That's what we ought
[1:02:28] to be doing with our children is praying
[1:02:30] for them.
[1:02:32] He
[1:02:32] says, I love to do it. taking them
[1:02:33] little girls of mine there, setting them
[1:02:35] down there and just look in their little
[1:02:37] eyes, listening, their ears listening,
[1:02:39] their eyes looking on. I tell them about
[1:02:41] all about Jesus and how he loves them
[1:02:43] and things.
[1:02:44] He starts as he talks about how they're
[1:02:47] they're there, they're listening,
[1:02:48] they're they're paying attention,
[1:02:49] they're interested in says they'll kneel
[1:02:51] right around the chairs and pray just
[1:02:53] like the rest of us because they're
[1:02:55] taught to do that
[1:02:56] and they have a desire to to even uh do
[1:02:59] what the parents are doing. That's where
[1:03:00] we want you to do it, isn't it? That's
[1:03:02] the way many of you do it. That's what
[1:03:04] you should do. I went into many a home
[1:03:07] and the children are all gathered around
[1:03:09] for family prayer always. God bless that
[1:03:11] family. That's the tithe that binds. If
[1:03:15] you did that in your home, there
[1:03:16] wouldn't be so many divorce cases and
[1:03:17] things going on the way there is. You'd
[1:03:19] have fellowship with each other.
[1:03:20] You'd have fellowship with each other.
[1:03:23] That's where our fellowship can begin
[1:03:25] with our children
[1:03:27] is around the things of God.
[1:03:30] And that's what we can do this year.
[1:03:33] This can be a preview of what's going to
[1:03:34] be in our homes.
[1:03:36] There's going to be gathering around the
[1:03:37] word.
[1:03:40] Let's stand together this evening.
