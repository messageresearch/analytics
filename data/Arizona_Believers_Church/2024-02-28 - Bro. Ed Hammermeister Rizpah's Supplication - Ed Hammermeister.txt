TRANSCRIPT
========================================
at home I would say you have the comfort of your seats at home that's a joke when we say that because we have wooden pews and everybody knows exactly what is said about that I'm going to ask you to turn to 2 Samuel chapter 3 2 Samuel chapter 3 this may seem very unrelated but the Lord willing will'll let this unfold as as God would lead us this is in in verse 6 2 Samuel 3:6 and it came to pass while there was war between the House of Saul and the House of David that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul and Saul had a concubine whose name was risah the daughter of aah and ishbosheth said to Abner so ishbosheth was the son of Saul that was reigning over Israel at that time and here's this woman but he says to Abner one of his leading generals and he said wherefore have you gone in unto my father's conc uine and then was Abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth and said am I a dog's head which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father and to his Brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of David that thou charges me today with a fault concerning this woman so if I can take this example here's a woman and and if I'm going to just start to parallel this I'm going to actually call this service just for the sake of having a title that's different I'm going to call this risb supplications and and and we'll we'll we'll do it but I I want to take this if I can and I'll come back to this little portion of scripture after a bit but in the first reading in Matthew chapter 26 we had a woman that was there who I will say grew up on the wrong side of the fence it was a woman who had no connection with religion had no connection no identification outwardly or in any way that she herself could connect and yet God is a God who does not work in just barriers in manmade uh if we can call it sectarianism man-made channels and and sometimes we ourselves box people into certain places but I've learned one thing about God God's a God that transcends all kinds of lines he moves Beyond he actually Delights in doing something beyond what we think and I like to leave room to do that I like to leave him room to to do something beyond what we think is the right thing to do it it was when when when Moses was there and he spoke those words and he says they're standing at the Red Sea and there's there's Egypt Army behind them the Red Sea in front of him he's trapped and he speaks by inspiration this day you'll see these Egyptians no more now now he had no idea what he was saying because when he got back to his intellect he's saying Lord what am I going to do and he says don't cry to me speak and he' already spoken but the outworking of it it could have been these days this Egyptians you'll see no more they could have gone home they could have done this but God had a plan where there was a sea going to open up they were going to go through the sea then the waters going to fall the outworking is God's it is not our outworking so I I like to leave room for God to do that now this woman here as we read with the alabaster box she'd come into a season she seemed to be on the wrong side but in her was something that Drew her to God it drew her to a place she may have misrepresented her life in what could have been a a mother what would could have been a real dear wife what could have been something it was misplaced but at the right season at the right time there was a place for her and God had that place for her and it manifested at Jesus Christ and it was a season where now God moved Upon A a vessel or a womb that was an uncharacteristically seemingly wrong choice but he moved on her because it was a season and she was a seed of God so now we find in Samuel here's another woman and she is a concubine out of the house of Saul now this is occurring just after Saul has passed away this is now occurring as David is coming into power and this woman this risah as she's known she is she is now in the house of Saul and the Bible would would tell us that the house of Saul was in Decline it was getting weaker and that the House of David was getting stronger and this woman was a woman who uh was seemingly a a concubine not even a wife was was on the wrong side of the fence and she became a catalyst a catalyst whereby now Abner and the Bible doesn't tell us if he went into to her and what motive he went into her with but he went into maybe to to get more Authority in the Kingdom uh over the king because this is a way of demonstrating that in those days but whatever it did it became the Catalyst where there became a separation between Saul's son who was the King and his leading general and that General went over to David's Camp so so this became a catalyst now I'm going to just back up a step and slow down cuz I feel like I'm moving too quickly I I I would like to just I want to be able for the Lord to minister to us and u i i i love brother Aaron Brother Aaron actually intimidates me sometimes because he's got such a sharp mind and he and he does that so I could preach his service for brother Aaron but I'm not going to try to impress him I am here to serve the Lord I am here to serve his people so I'm going to do that and so I I just spoke my complex out of existence anyway I love brother I whenever I call him I make sure I had two cups of coffee and I'm ready to meet the challenge I also learn to keep my wit about me with him now I'd like to make this relevant to where we are speaking of a woman today and that woman is the bride and a woman since the Fall In the Garden of Eden a woman has been seemingly as we would call it on not the footing that it all started out which was equal with but God is in the process of bringing the woman back into relationship back into the place where she is going to be the final voice where her actions will dictate to the enemy that caused all of this that that God is back in control and he has brought everything and restored it now it's amazing to me that a woman was the Target in the Garden of Eden and and and I I would look at it this way I believe if you go to serpent seed uh and I think maybe it's that message maybe it's another but Satan who had been kicked out of heaven now was on Earth and he watched God in creation and he always desired creation but yet he never was given that and in fact that's where iniquity was found on him he was not content to be what God made him now God's going to use a woman who is going to be content with what God made her to defeat him and he will never create but this woman that he caused to fall in the end she will in fact speak words that are creative not of herself but of the God who made her and so we want to yield oursel to God's program in the order that it's in so a woman if you can look at in the Garden of Eden she became and and and Satan had watched creation and now there was a period of time before the woman came forth and Satan would view that and he would look at this woman and he would say this woman now there's something out of order in creation here there's something and and he began to view her as a Target and he would embody himself in the serpent the closest thing to a human being that could mingle the seed and he began to Target that now God has also desired you and the enemy will watch you and he'll watch how the favor of God is maybe upon you how God will drop a handful in purpose for you how God will speak to you and you'll respond in a way that is beyond that the enemy sees that and as much as God desires you the enemy desires you now the enemy desires to have a part of you and God does now if if we take this in natural terms there's a little piece of land in the Middle East and it's amazing that out of all the land and the Earth today how everybody desires that piece of land and so Israel in the natural is where God's choice is been about a certain amount of Real Estate but it's also what Satan's after and we can take that as a type to what we are battling with in this last age now when Eve fell and I'll just refer quickly to this in Genesis chapter 3 and and and I'll just read from it if you don't follow to the scriptures that's fine but when Eve eventually fell so in Genesis 3 verse1 15 uh it was God addressing the serpent and he says I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so he's addressing the serpent and in in in in the message Joseph meeting his Brethren brother Ram would say this as soon as God seen the seed of the woman and how they had been mcre misconstrued there and righteousness had been perverted Ed God gave a promise that through that woman would come a blessed seed there would be a seed and he says and as soon as Satan heard that now listen there he's addressing the serpent but Satan was the one who had embodied that serpent he said as soon as Satan heard that who was standing Pro present as soon as he heard it he tried to destroy that seed and he tried to do it in Joseph he tried to do it all through the age and he's still against that blessed seed now in in in greatest battle ever fought brother B would say the battle that started in heaven came down to earth and it met at the grounds of the mind and it met in that woman and it's still the same today it's meeting in that but there's a difference this eve will not fall this eve will stand this eve has something about her and I don't I don't know if you found that there's times I thought I didn't have it but all of a sudden I find a little something out of the ashes that comes up and I say I cannot deny this I cannot stop what's inside of me God has determined something that is greater than me myself so he addresses the The Serpent and then in verse 16 he addresses to the woman and unto the woman he says I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception now associated with conception is sorrow but also associated with his joy and and there is something about that conception that is ingrained in a woman that even later in the scripture God would himself see that associated with that act with that something that came this life that comes out of her that remains in a woman right to the end Hey listen I had to go to the airport the other day and uh pick up my wife and we got this long distance between the pickup zone and where you go and I thought this is cold out what am I going to do so I drove up to the front gate and I said listen I got to go pick up a grandma and they said okay go ahead well my wife's a grandma right so second time now same with me right but I had to pick her up and she's a grandma but listen it only the picture only gets bigger she's a mother I mean she was leaving us for a few weeks and she said I'm so worried I says what are you worried about well you're going to be here all alone and Ethan and I said he's 21 I said I'm here I can take care of myself and even if I don't I can stand to lose a few pounds and so like like but it's ingrained in her you can't take it out of her and now that she's a grandma it's gone to another level you can't stop it hey associated with I'll multiply your sorrow and your conception yeah the multiplication is also associated with that that what God made her and now he goes goes on beyond that he says now in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so so here a woman that is a will submit herself to the plan of God God will see to it that he brings about a finality to his Redemptive work now brother Adam would say in spoken words The Original seeve Seed Eve would have brought forth in other words she was the bedding ground she was what God was going to use and she would have eventually brought forth A Spoken Word children now how that was and how it all unfolds I don't know brother mam will say in invisible Union a woman is usted with certain characters she must not defile there's no creature on earth like a woman now a woman was in the beginning of creation because God knew she would fall and but he says I'll just go back to this I'm skipping a few things she has a sacred charge from God for Redemption right amen and it says it was God's great wisdom she was if she would have not been that way wouldn't dis complimentary to God's great wisdom she was made a byproduct of man her body is given to her a sacred Trust From God it's sacred she is to bring forth life into the Earth her body is the Bing grounds of life therefore the reason that she's given this trust so we're speaking about a woman natural but we also need to recognize that that we as a people are the spiritual part of Christ now as as I move this along and I'm I'm trying to hold back from not jumping ahead brother Brandon would say what a sacred trust to the woman but then he types it to the church she has the same resp responsibility a woman to Motherhood her virtues her husband the church a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to Christ the same as the woman has now I know the battles that I have faced this year I have will have been 40 years that I've been serving the lord and and I look back and I look at what God did in the beginning and then I look at the challenges I faced and I look at where the enemy comes and where he seeks to defile where he seeks to just gain a foothold to do something and I'll tell you what it doesn't never stop because that's the enemy but there's also something when you're in love with the Lord when when it's not just rules and regulation no rules without relationship brings Rebellion but a relationship brings Faith brings love brings something that the that the enemy will never enter into and so what ought I say is Strive to keep that love strive to keep that relationship and it will keep you from doing things that the enemy would would in otherwise plant or gain a foothold in so this is the channel that God is Desiring to work in and this channel as as brother Brandon would speak in God's power to transform he says here he had brought forth everything on Earth put the seed in it with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant now if I can just and and I'm I'm skipping I'm just hitting some points but you know it was Admiral bird I believe it was he was he was the one who was traveling to the South Pole he had an expedition and he thought I'm going to bring along these cattle and these cattle are going to provide us fresh milk along the way on the journey and and back in those days they they would do it you know it would be whole milk it wouldn't be 2% half whatever it was it was whole milk and and but he brought them along and then they sewed these coats for these camels you say what are you saying this for but because he was trying to protect them but as they journeyed further north the inherent in the seed within these animals they began to grow out longer body hair and covering in fact they had no need of the coats because it was already within the seed the point I'm saying is the seed that's in US is a seed that transcends the fall it's a seed that transcends the conditions it's a seed that goes beyond anything we faced it it'll match the challenge in Luther's day it'll match the challenge in our day but it is God seed and it has these qualities within it and it is more than enough to meet the challenge and so that seed and and brother man would say it has a transforming power within God put the seed there with with potentials as long as it stayed in the right channel so I'll say if we can stay in the channel and maybe I this is really maybe as basic as the thought gets whatever your channel is stay in that channel if you're if you're a preacher be a preacher if you're a deacon be a deacon if you're a song leader stay a song leader all the all the preachers want to be singers and all the singers want to be preachers it's a joke around the around our place I I often say is the Lord reason the lord gave us so many good singers it's to overcome the preacher they have in their midst because the preacher is not a singer I've tried but it doesn't work so I just learn abide in your calling now it says earnestly desire the best gifts you know singers I think is one of the best gifts but nonetheless stay in your channel if you're a housewife stay in your channel God will bless you if you stay in the channel that God has has put you in let's we'll just come to that as we work along here a bit so now stay in that channel now if I go a little bit further I want to just take this a little bit on the thought of supplications and as much as a woman is subject he's got these characteristics she's inborn yet God takes these characteristics and he uses them I I I believe it was in in Hebrews chap 11 it would talk about Moses and Moses birth and and and and it starts out it doesn't mention his parents by name but brother Brandon mentions his parents and he talks about amram and josed and he talks about them but God used the characteristics of a mother of a mother who was not afraid of the king's commandment in other words the inside that woman even a fallen woman and the characteristics to be a bedding ground and to bring forth life and in that woman there was a faith that stood up in the great of the one in the face of one of the greatest persecutions that that woman would say I'm not afraid of the king's commandment I'm not going to give my son I'm going to hide my son even for three months and then he says I'll rather put him on on on a on a on a River Nile with crocodiles and I'll entrust him to God and the Bible would say by faith Moses when he was born he was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's coming commandment so God uses a mother he uses a woman and it was a woman who no doubt was very careful about how she did these things listen God himself Likens his his remembrance of us as children to that of the faith of a mother he says a mother may forget her suckling child but I will never I will never forget you now we'll just drop back for a moment and I I'll just reference this is in in 1st Samuel chter 5 and I'm I'm I'm just building to a few thoughts and dropping some things in along the way in in Simplicity this is the car I picked so we're we're going with it by the way it was a Volkswagen in the end in case anybody's looking 1 Samuel chap 1st Samuel chapter 1 let's just read this from verse 5 and this is maybe very familiar was talking about a man who had two two wives Hannah and panah and and if I could if I could characteristic this the story this way God knew where Israel was at God knew that Eli was coming to the end of his his priesthood he knew he had corrupt Sons now God had to bring forth what Israel needed was a prophet now he couldn't force a woman to say will you you know I want you to give up your child but God had to work according to the characteristics that were endowed in a woman and he had to bring her to a certain place where she would be willing to give her child unto the Lord so he creates these characteristics and here is this woman uh well Elana is the husband panah is the first wife in verse 5 but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb now God held back you ever you ever ever God hold back on your promise you ever have him just why you know something you've had for years and years and years and and you know it's there you know it's coming but it's still not there and you might get frustrated you might do things but all along it's building you it's building some character it's building you to what you want I don't know what kind of character it's going to take to to have the power of the spoken word enacted in its time and in its season but I say it will be necessary and I'll say it will be God's work that will bring us to that place so he brings this woman to this place he shuts up her womb and her adversary provoked her sore to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb and as he did so year by year she went up to the house of the Lord and He provoked her for she provoked her now I don't know what she was doing to provoke her maybe it was a SN little remark maybe it was this or maybe it was just the fact that she had a child and the other one didn't and therefore she wept and did not eat now look at where this woman was coming to this is beyond the natural birth pains and Mourning sickness this is this is a spiritual groaning then said Al her husband Hannah why weepest thou and he said why don't you eat with me why is your heart grieved am I not better to you than 10 Sons so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after that she drunk and and and it goes down she comes she comes up into the temple Eli the pr the priest sat upon a seat by the post of the temple in the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul now if you actually look up prayer there's four types of prayers there's a prayer of adoration there's a prayer of Thanksgiving there's a prayer of petition where you have forgiveness where you have reconciliation confession and then there's a prayer of intercession and and many times intercession goes beyond Lord just bless me but there's times that the conditions are such that you begin to seek the Lord you begin to with a daily with a fervent within an ingrained something it becomes something greater than you yourself can even handle and it's called supplications and the and the Bible would say say it to us in in Ephesians 6 praying always with all prayer and supplication in other words you wake up in the morning you go out Lord remember such and such remember so and so Lord on my heart it doesn't ever stop it's a groaning it's something within you and it says with every be careful for nothing Ephesians 4 Philip Philippians 4 but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving so in other words God is bringing something in Forth it's I think I think it was Charles Spurgeon they asked him one time they said what's more important is it reading the Bible or praying and he asked the question in return he says well what's more important breathing in or breathing out you need both you need both you you can read and so intellect ize the word and you can pray and you can pray in such a way that that all all you do is just yourself and your emotion that you're buried in but it takes the two together so all of these things have to come together and Timothy would say I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions giving of thanks be made for all men and I would talk about a widow uh you know that is a widow indeed trusting in God continuing in supplications I could go around this room and probably take a poll you know that there are prayers that you've been waiting on for years that have not come to fruition but it's a continual supplication it's a continual Thing Before the Throne of God you thank God for the things he's done you thank him for providing you you you praise him you love him you adore him but underneath all of that then comes but Lord remember so and so remember this situation we all have it right and yet the Bible tells of it so much so that in Hebrews it would tell even of the Lord Jesus in the days of his flesh when he offered up prayers and supplications our Lord did that with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from Death now in may like I I'm putting this we're on this side and it may look like where is the Lord in my situation and it' be easy to get discouraged but I'll say this stay in that channel you don't know how it'll play out you don't know how it'll manifest you don't know how it'll do it and in fact I I I'll say right now I'm a product of a woman's supplications I had a mother that never stopped praying for me I had a mother that watched her son in the midst of a family that was broken that was separated and and and and two and two of her sons went out in the world and did all kinds of things and and here I was 2: am in the morning having a great time and a great party at a party and all of a sudden the party just stopped and I had nowhere to Nowhere left to go so I went home and I come in the house and here's my mom praying in the in the living room and she said I woke up at 2:00 and you weren't there I went on my knees and I started praying that was about the time the party broke up don't you think God hears yeah did he answer that prayer he answered that prayer did she stop praying she didn't stop praying and and and I say this to the glory of God I'm a product of a Praying Mother I I believe it's more than that but God had her there for a reason he placed a seene but he needed something to help along the way and God put something in a in in Susanna Wesley he put something in grandmothers and mothers and and he put it there for a reason and he put it in the church friends let's not stop let's stay before God don't ever grow weary and well-doing God has placed these things there and they're necessary here's Hannah in bitterness of Soul verse 10 and she prays to the Lord and it's in this most desperate time now look look at what it brought her to she vowed a vow oh and said oh lord of hosts if you will indeed look upon the Affliction of thine handmade and remember me and not forget thine handmade but will give thine handmade not just a child but a Manchild why because a Manchild as especially as a firstborn that was going to be an heir that was going to be the one that God required then if you do that Lord I'll give him to you now this is a free will offering but look at the conditions that bore this offering look at what the garden of eat God will not force you but he will draw out of you the very thing that he's Desiring to bring out of you amen and he says here she was he says I'll I'll give him to the Lord all the days of his life and there'll be no razor com upon his head now we know the rest of the story we know that Samuel was born we know that he became the prophet of Israel one of the great prophets in the bible but look at how that was born and I say that that's that's that's a channel that we ought to be in brother Brandon would say this in in a message and you'd say God has a program and he will set you and place you in Christ where he thinks it will work best for him just stay in your calling don't try to get yet somebody else's calling stay in your calling if you're a housewife remain a housewife whatever God has called you to do just remain there he knows where and how to put his hand on you and use you and then he says he had a little old woman named Hannah one time a housewife he knowed where to place her and he knowed what he was going to do with her I think that's wonderful he had one named Mary just be humble submit yourself to him and walk on now I've got to move this along a little bit just to to stay in in in line with the scripture the scriptures I want to get to let's just where are we at intercessory let's just go to Matthew 15 for a moment this this is also a familiar portion but I I I find it amazing how God would utilize a a woman and the characteristic I and I'm I'm focusing on that a little bit in terms of the Bride but this is in verse 21 Matthew 15: 21 and Jesus went then and departed at the coast of tyon and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and cried to him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil now this was a real legitimate complaint a real legitimate need but it's a woman who is on the wrong side of the fence she she approaches him and and there's many aspects to this story in brother bam will bring him and and she approaches him as oh Lord as son of David which was the wrong approach literally it was the wrong approach and he never answered her a word and the disciples came and besought her send her away she's crying after us this woman will not stop why she was a woman who had a daughter and had a need and by nature she was going along with the way she was listen the Bible is filled with these David David had a close friend Jonathan who was of the House of Saul and David said the love that he had with Jonathan surpassed the love of anything on the world he says God had put them together and it was David who years later even after Saul and Jonathan died he sought out Jonathan's son that he might do good for him even though he was on the wrong side of the fence the love of God will transcend a lot of things don't put people in a box and I'll say this the enemy wants to put people in a box but you stay with what God puts in your heart when you kneel in prayer hey oh they Fellowship across town that has nothing to do with it just be faithful be who you are and let God deal with the rest he goes on to say he answered another word and she answered and said I'm not sent but to the lost sheep of the House of Israel now look at this response this is Beyond then she then came she and worshiped him Lord help me that turned him listen Friends when the Seven Seals opened what followed that opening worship worship followed it whatever you do thank God worship him for because listen something is opened that cannot be changed something's opened that the devil can never get his hands on something's open we may not have come to it but start thanking for it start thanking him for it and he says now I I'm not I'm not and he answered it's not meat for me to take the children's bed and to cast it to dogs now this the spirit the level that this woman got to I'll tell you what it was not just showing up at a church service this was something that was heavily born and deep within her and she says that's the truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table and the Jesus said oh woman Great Is Thy Faithfulness be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour look at who who orchestrated this God allowed these circumstances to bring out the nature of a true seed and to bring it right before him and at the appropriate hour there was such a great Deliverance I think this is marvelous there's so many things I could take of the Bible but brother banam would would talk you know he said one of the most important messages that he ever spoke was the token and then that evening as he's coming he speaks this is the message that's needed to follow the token the enemy will reduce the message to superficial he'll reduce it to just skimming quotes to just reading things but I'll say when you actually get into relationship and and you're in church and and it's not just the minister who's working for you but you see the Lord working behind the scenes when you recognize that the prophet is not just quotes I'm going to paste on the wall but that's my Lord speaking there that's him speaking to me personally in this generation this age and my identification is in that it's not just in the messenger it's not just in elazar but it's in my Lord who's behind all of that and when that comes I'll tell you what that brings a reality [Music] and so desperation brother man said we are on the verge of one of the mightiest things that's ever struck the struck the Earth since the days of the Lord Jesus see see now it'll be so humble see what what man calls Mighty God calls an Abomination what God what man calls foolish God calls Mighty now watch it it'll be so humble that you'll miss it if you don't have the token there to examine it I see a lot of promises in the Bible but they are not independent and I'll say in this last stage they are not independent of Our Lord in fact every one of our promises the bride's promises are because of our lord it's not that I'm going to pick out this part of the message and I'll run with that or I'll pick out this part and run with it no it's part of the package and I want the whole package I don't I don't want just my take on it or my stick on it or whatever it is I want the whole package I'll surrender to the whole thing and I believe that's where God wants us to be now he says this also he says the reason reason tonight that there are many things that that well I'll just I'll just summarize it he says the reason we are not desperate enough is a lack of love the enemy will try to bring us into a lukewarm formal condition and listen he does it tries to do it to me but I thank God that he shakes me up every once in a while I thank God that it's not just I I I want I want to be shook up now before it's somewhere down the road I I would say Lord bring me into that channel now I need to move this along let's go over to let's go over to Genesis 15 I'm really getting to the Crux of where I want to get to now and and we'll just take it this way Genesis chapter 15 now this is Abraham and uh you know one thing I find about Abraham is there was something in Abraham's life that stayed with him and and and and you you can look at several aspects of Abraham's life but it was his attitude towards the sacrifice it was his attitude when God told him in Genesis 12 to leave and then at a certain place he had a sacrifice and it was so noteworthy that even the Heathen would notice others would notice but a he had something about the sacrifice because God was leading him up to Genesis 22 where he was was going to offer his own son as a sacrifice and and at the end of the day I I'll say it this way Revelations 12 how is the bride going to overcome they overcome by the word of their testimony they overcome by the blood of the lamb and they also overcome because they love not their lives unto death there's a channel that you've got to enter into to come to a fullness amen now Abraham this exemplified through his life so we're going to pick up this in Genesis 15 and verse 6 and he says he believed in the Lord and He count to him for righteousness and here God's rehearsing the promise to him said I am the Lord that brought thee out of er of the chales to give thee this land to inherit it now look at look at where he's talking he's talking about the inheritance now he says Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it so he's talking about the inheritance he says now okay this is what you do take a heer of three years old a goat of three years old a ram of 3 years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took them all and he divided them in the midst and he laid each piece one against the other but the birds he divided not so I'm not going to focus on the order of these events and what they do but I want to take a look at Abraham's attitude regarding the sacrifice and I say we all are obligated to give something so now as the sacrifice is there what happens he's given the sacrifice maybe it's midday but about the evening time in the next verse you can take it he says now he's divided them and when the fowls came the birds those things around the Earth they came to descend upon his sacrifice it was Abraham's duty to beat them off friends the the message we have don't think for a moment that when you make your house a home that the enem is going to leave you but you got to beat it off you've got to protect that sacrifice I don't know if I I took the quote but brother bam would say in one place he said he knew what Abraham would do and he knew how Abraham would treat that listen God knew that when lot was would sin Abraham would go after him he also knew that when the king of Sodom came at the end and said Abraham you've rescued us all he also knew there was something in Abraham that said I will not even take the thread or a sho latchet from you and in the same breath he would turn and here is MDC and Abraham says I'll give you a tenth what was it doing it was exemplifying something that was a characteristic of the seed that was within him and it began to show in real life situations there there there's a testimony I I'd give of my wife I don't have the time to do it today but I'll say now I open the door now I open the door okay Readers Digest condensed version her and my daughter going to Louisiana Camp fly from Edmonton to Houston they're going to rent a car in Houston she left her credit card at home she's going to the car rent she's got money she's got everything but without a credit card there's no authorization there's no car there's no nothing you're not going to be able to drive the 4 hours to Louisiana and I said well I'll pay on this and no that won't work I we'll use this do you take Sears member Sears how many member Sears I just trapped you into saying how old you were so Sears oh yeah that we take Sears I went through all the process oh this is Sears Canada no we don't take that I mean it was it was like the whole afternoon and my wife is there and and about that moment I said well who do we know in the area that could put down their card for you well so and so they'd have to drive they have to do this well maybe ask somebody there you got the money give them the money and let them I mean what's the Chan of that in Houston in Texas Texas of all places you know can any good thing come out of Texas well there's one good thing that came out of Texas but listen we're there we're there we're in this in this place and then and I'm on the phone and then she says hold on there's somebody coming well 10 minutes later I get a phone call there's a man standing there he said this man's going to help us he's going to put down his credit card I'm going to give him the money and he's and I talking sir we appreciate what you're doing all of these things here's the story my wife gets the guy pays for it like all the people at the car rental agen sir do you know what you're doing yeah I know what I'm doing I know what I'm anyway she goes down he's a big guy about 6'4 whatever they go down my daughter's there my wife is there they get in the car with him and as they get in the car with him here is she sits in the car all she realize I'm getting in a car with this guy that I don't know I'm in the front I don't know what he's going to do and she says you mind if we pray and and she prayed said thank you for this thank I mean all that she knew to do was be what she was her role was a mother over her daughter in the back seat was over the situation on their focus where they were going the man drove out they drove him back to the terminal he was catching a flight somewhere else anyway there's a lot more to the story but I'll just say it this way he called me the next day and he said did your and my wife drove on they made it to the to the camp meeting all right my daughter was really grieved because they missed the shopping trip they' planned along the way but but one brother said one time he says the reason woman women love shopping is because they're a byproduct when when they see a product they like to buy it listen they made it to the camp this guy calls me the next day says did your daughter and your your your wife make it I said yeah they made it thank you he said have a blessed Easter with the Serv when when everything was over she came back from the trip we had overpaid him about $30 cash the man we wrote him back said keep the rest of the money thank you for your help no no I'm sending you the money a week later we got $30 in the mail and the man says I saw that your daughter needed your wife needed help and therefore I paid her here's my story I'm a single parent I've got three children maybe one day somewhere they're going to need some help and I pray that the same God that allowed me to help your wife will help them do you want to know how the program of God works there's a man maybe never in the message NE anywhere but on the day of judgment I assure you when he stands up and I come there and I say does anything any have something to say about this man yeah he helped my wife in a time of need okay sir you helped one of my daughters come in to eternal life you don't think it makes a difference how we conduct our Affairs and how we do things it surely does it's God's grace I opened the door to that story and now I got to go back to where I was and I don't quite remember here's Abraham and these birds are coming and God says this about our sacrifice God confirmed his Covenant right there but now he gives Abraham his part brother keep the vultures off of it keep the old worldly Hollywood vultures out of the Pentecostal Church keep them away from our women and you with all these big silly jokes and things let them have it that's their Kingdom we're not of this world and he would go on to say he said he took those animals what is this a type of and Abraham beating them away that's a type in this last days casting out Devils from the sacrifice God promised the sacrifice them unbelieving spirits are trying to devour it but that man of God casting the Devils away from it confirming the Covenant and he says so must the seed of God stand in these last days now this is a type this is a wonderful type I really got to move along how are we doing here okay let's Abraham's attitude I I just if I can pick that up let's go back to if we can to 1 2 Samuel chap 3 this will be one of our opening scriptures brother Aaron asked me for the title this afternoon if I would have told him Reba's supplications he would have spent all afternoon searching it out he probably didn't doesn't care he wanted to wait for the service good for you God bless you real time if you take the context of what we read 2 Samuel chap 2:3 there was a long war between the house of Saul and the House of David but David waxed stronger and stronger and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker now here's David David has just heard the report of Saul passing away he weeps and he cries for David and and Jonathan or for Saul and Jonathan and then a messenger comes and says I'm the one who killed him and it was just to get David's attention and David shows his colors and he says no he says you touch God's anointed you'll pay with your life and he never did' touch God's anointed but yet he paid for his with his life so here's here's David ascending to the king ascending to the be the kingdom now God leads him to be the king over Judah so he dwells and he goes up to Hebron and he dwells at Hebron for 7even years and six months and while he's there this is where this scripture starts to go now it says unto David were born were Sons born in Hebron the first was amnon of anahi and the second was so he here's the sons of David that were born you can follow the through the first was amnon the second was chileab if that's the correct way of saying it the next was Absalon the fourth was adonijah and then the fifth was Shep paaya and the sixth itham six Sons born to David six Sons born of David's wives but the seventh one that was mentioned the seventh woman mentioned was risah of the wrong side of the lineage of the wrong side of the fence if we can call it but yet she was in a place and she didn't even know what was ahead for her but this is the background to where she came from now this is part of the Ascension of David to the kingdom let's just take this over to 2 Samuel chapter 21 2 Samuel chapter 21 verse one then there was a famine in the days of David 3 years year after Year and David inquired of the Lord and the Lord answered it is for Saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibit so if you catch the big picture there's a famine that strikes Israel natural events and David the king says Lord why is this so it's because of Saul and what he did to the gibeonites and if you remember the gibeonites they were the ones who came in by deceit to Joshua and said said we have come from a long way off they dressed with old clothes they saved their moldy bread they saved all these things and they deceived Joshua but they were brought into the Covenant and as they were brought into the Covenant they always had a place they became the hewers for Israel but God remembered them so much so that many years down the road when Saul slew them God held it against Israel now God remembers everything and I believe God is a God not only of the Bride but God is a god of the foolish virgin God is a god of of if I can call it uh Israel God is a god of even those that are good to the bride but look at the place that God has placed us look at the place we have in the economy of God I don't have time to get into Daniel chapter 7 but the books were opened and and another book was opened and there was thousands that ministered and tens of thousands the thousands that ministered were the bride there was something that they were doing they were giving him a service now here David when he hears God's judgment and why all of this is coming he calls the gibeonites and he said to them now the gibeonites were not of the children of Israel but the remnant of the amorites and the children of Israel had sworn to them and Saul sought to slay them in his Zeal to the children of Israel in Judah therefore David said to the gibeonites he says now this is what's happening what shall I do with for you how can I make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord now if you go back what what Abraham did in Genesis 15 whereby shall I know that I may inherit it now friends we are coming into our inheritance and God had typed out the inheritance in the land first in the mothers who growned and when they groaned they groan the name of their children and it related to a position in the land now there's a groaning at the time of the birth there's a groaning now here at the time of The Inheritance and he and he says the gibat said to David we have no silver or gold of Saul or of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel and he said what shall you say that I shall do for you and they answered the king the man that consumed us and devised against us which was Saul that we should be destroyed from remaining in the coast let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up in the L unto the Lord in giba of Saul whom the Lord did choose now he's saying here's the retribution give us seven sons and he says of those seven sons hang their heads and he says and the King you can choose them I'll give them so the king first of all he spares mephibosheth which was the son of Jonathan of Saul because of the Lord's oath that was between them between David and Jonathan but here's here's this woman coming into view but the king took two sons of RBA the daughter of a whom she bear unto Saul Armon and meib and five sons of Michael the daughter of Saul whom she brought up for Adriel the son of barcelia theh halite so he takes two sons of risah and five sons of Michael and he says and he delivered them to the hands of the G gibeonites they hung them in the hill all seven together they were put to death in the days of the Harvest in the first days in the beginning of the Harvest now just go back to what Abraham did and now watch what's happening here and risah the daughter of AI took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of the Harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night this is amazing to me this is not a one day thing this is from the beginning of the Harvest until rain came and the reason rain was being withheld was because of the very sacrifice she had been forced to give but she was a mother and she stayed in her Channel and that which she gave forth was her sons and she couldn't bear to see them put to shame to be eaten up by the birds or the animals of the field and she stays there continually now if you go back to the original part of this whole promise if I can inject this what God told uh King David was the curse is because of what Saul did and then he asked the gibon ites they said let these men now really the curse should have been lifted but it wasn't it still stayed there I I'm I'm going to drop this in because this is beautiful to me but you know what we're living in a Time friends as I said God transcends lines David was the king but as a king in the battle on the way he ate the showbread that was reserved for the priest and God never rebuked him for it in fact Israel was to be priest but we as a bride are to be Kings and Priests we are not just reserved a special place but we begin to transcend we begin to go beyond Jesus did this when he came on Earth we as a bride we begin to step out ahead of time exercising our power on who we are and we do it not by party lines but we do it by Nature that we love the Lord and we do a ser for him and I'll do whatever it takes so here's risah the curse should have been lifted But Here by Nature she comes and she can't bear to see her sons they're sacrificed they're dead and she she can't do anything about it she's just a concubine from the house of Saul she can't even appeal to David all she can appeal to is her nature as a mother and as a nature as a mother she doesn't allow these animals and here's David up in the Kings I I I I say it this way friends we're on Earth God is in heaven but there's something happening there's a connection that's happening under the seven seal there was silence in heaven but there was things happening on Earth that I believe God is beginning to act on don't think for a moment your supplications that which you're doing there's something you're doing and I'll say this God there there's there's a there's a connection if we can see it and it says in verse 11 and it was told David what risah the daughter of AI the concubine of Saul had done now I don't know what was going on in David's mind he's going what is this woman doing she's there day and night day beating these things off why is she doing that and all of a sudden it triggers in David's mind there's something she's doing and look at the next move David makes and David went and he took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of jath Gilead who had stolen from the street of Bashan where the Philistines had hung him and the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilbo so Saul and d and Jonathan met their end in a Philistine country they were buried there and they weren't in their rightful place and God who is a God your name cannot be taken away from the place in the land you can never be dis taken away from The Inheritance that God has purchased you through Jesus Christ and here here's David sees this and he takes in verse 14 and the bones of Sol and Jonathan his son were buried in the country of Benjamin in zelah in the separer of kish's father and they performed All the King's Command so the king says put them back in their place get them in Benjamin get them in their inheritance and the next verse says and after that God was intreated for the land now who was the Catalyst behind all of this was a woman who was just performing her act performing a a duty by nature and it moved the king's heart don't think friends for a moment God doesn't see your righteous life your your groanings your utterings that which you're doing and you don't know the moment that what you do what you're playing out by God by the nature he put in you is having an effect in heaven you don't know when God will move on the scene you don't know when he'll do something I I I I I'll share this for a moment I told you my mother prayed for me my mother God bless her I had a wonderful grandmother I had a wonderful mother I feel like Timothy Timothy who Paul would say you're the faith I saw in your grandmother and your mother I see in you I thought this is a wonderful type and then I start going through trials and hard things I go okay I don't know if I like this type my mother made made it through a war the eldest daughter watched over her siblings came through second world war made her way to Canada the first of our family worked and labored she's 91 years old she prayed she was in the midst of a uh a relationship with my father who when they came together was not in the message or the banner of the message was in the Baptist Church came together but found out there was all kinds of demonic influences and religious spirits and and at very early age it began to be a tension in the home and in 1963 my M my grand my mother wrote brother brandham and said I need your prayer for my husband and I was already born then my my brother was born my daughter my sister wasn't born and she wrote and brother brandham wrote her back I pray that the Lord would set him free of the evil spirits and that you would be happy together the first night she put the prayer cloth under my father's pillow demon Spirits attacked her that night she never stopped praying in fact the situation got worse situation my father got worse years later he divorced her all kinds of accusations against her my father did all kinds of things and I can't even go into the depth and the detail of it all but she never stopped and she kept praying and she kept praying and 10 years went by and 20 years went by and 30 years and he'd moved out to Vancouver Isle and did all kinds of things and and finally came back home he had alien himself from the whole family but she never stopped and here's the point even for me he saw what God did in my life I was the eldest I never was able to preach to him but what I was able to do was stay in the channel of a father to a son and I stayed in that relationship but God God made it real to me honor your father and mother and even though there wasn't much to respect or much to honor I stayed in that channel and in the end now and I remember it well brother Aaron it was a time sister Allison do passed away and and we had the funeral up in Grand Prairie and by the way that was a wonderful service you ministered on the Sunday and and and I came back and my father had collapsed in his apartment had been laying dormant in there for 36 hours his body temperature had gone down to nothing and he was taken by Hospital the ambulance he had an infection he had cancer and and it didn't look like he was going to make it his mind was gone and all kinds of things and and and for the first time I maybe offered prayer at the church I let them know two days later I go to the hospital and here's my father clear as a bell and he says Ed you're still here he says you've been a better son than I've ever been a father the atmosphere that happened at that time I can't even say it my mother and I went to the apartment where he was there was blood there was feces there was vomit all over the floor and I just said Lord no matter what he's done be merciful to him it was it was a love of God beyond what I could share but here was a mom that was praying and and and we came to the conclusion we did all of that and I came to the hospital at that time and all religious walls dropped and he began to open up and share things and say things and and he even told me the things you're preaching I don't understand it but you're doing the right thing just keep doing it and he would tell me he says I may not live for another thousand years but I know there's something for me on the other side I say what was it the supplications of a woman the supplications of God in a woman my brother and sister came from British Columbia we were there having lunch and they were alienated from my father and they were just kind of railing on the whole thing and why do we have to take care of them now and and I just said to them I said look at your mom almost 50 years she's waited for a promise and I said here she's still standing I said that's not a woman that's God in a woman and I watched God even do a work in my brother I watching those things it was tremendous and I'll say this by the grace of God I'll see my father again now he may not be a part of the Bride but that's listen if God can do that what can he do with our attitude towards our sacrifice what of our supplications listen this is Wednesday I'm going to stop there but I thank you for for just bearing with me I'll say this don't ever give up let me let me let me say this in conclusion stay in the channel that God has put you in I I think it was Florence sharan brother brandham would say she came to him and she said brother brandom she says I fast and Fast and pray but I still can't cast out devils and he says you weren't born to do such your duty is to fast the holy spirit is working on somebody else to car cast out Devils you don't know that place oh he said I wish you could catch that one person is burdened for this another one over there you don't know what to do you're just submissive to your call and it'll always line up with the scripture I believe if we could all work in harmony that way in a body what kind of of a body could this be now let me just take this this to my be my final two quotes but he says this he says now he saw your name before the foundation of the world he saw the deceitfulness of Satan in other words the great overrider he put a seed in you that he would predestinate you because he saw how Wicked Satan would be and he would put that in you and he said he put your name today and now he says now look at where he is the church positionally before the foundation of the World God in his labor pain bringing you forth positionally placing you to be a housewife a farmer a preacher a prophet he preached you POS he placed you positionally and he says now we are his subjects we must walk close to the author to understand it Lord what will you have me to do must I go to the fields and preach the gospel must I stay at home no matter what what it is if I must be a good housewife a good mother if I must do this if I must be a farmer Lord what would you have me to do I want to be in my position I don't want to try to be more than I ever ought to be let's stand together let's have the musicians come
