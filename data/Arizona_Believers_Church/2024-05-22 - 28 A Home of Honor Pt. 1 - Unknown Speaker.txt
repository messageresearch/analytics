TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the my title tonight is going to be a part one at least I feel that it will be as I won't be able to finish um all the thought I have before me but it's a A Home of Honor A Home of Honor drawing a lot from where we were even on Sunday where his name dwells so this would be a part one A Home of Honor if you could write that down now we'll reset uh the title here in just a moment but Deuteronomy 12:1 it saying this of the Tabernacle which ultimately becomes the temple there there shall be a then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there we realize that has something to do with his presence he should kind of glory and and he's saying there you bring all that I command you it's there that you'll bring burn offerings it's there that you'll sacrifice it's there that you bring your tithes and your heave offering and your choice vows it's there you'll Fellowship it's there you'll Rejoice it's there where I put my name God's one provided place of worship that chose in place of worship and he says that he will cause his name to dwell there in that place that he chooses this is the house of the Lord it be in the house of the Lord it carries his name he's willing to attach his name to it because to call it the Lord's House the one true God's house would not be misleading I think that's an important concept tonight that I'm really going to lean into is that he this is the house of the Lord so you should expect to find the Lord there and as we looked at different scriptures surrounding that if this is going to be the house of the Lord there must be certain prerequisites and certain characteristics because the name the place that I will cause my name to dwell this name is a Mark or a memorial of identification so it means I will identify myself there not that just there will be a name emblazoned in bricks or that there'll be a marquee out front that calls it God's house but his character his authority and his honor will be there you'll be able to learn about God you'll be able to fellowship with God it's there you'll be taught about God a lot of things that could come into this it's a place and this is what I draw from the name he'll cause my name to dwell there the name speaks of Honor Authority and character there'll be honor there there'll be Authority there there'll be character there and this should be the aspiration for all of us as individuals should be the aspiration for our homes and for our church that his name would dwell there that we would be a vessel of Honor that God's Authority would live through us that we would have the C Christlike character that can only come by the word and and through obedience and trials and that's for us as individuals we desire that in our home life and we desire that with our church the Bible says in Proverbs 22:1 a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches in loving favor rather than silver and gold this good name and loving favor comes by doing well by living a life that is above reproach it speaks of a man's reputation that even before you would meet him and interact with with him on a personal level his good name that goes before him his reputation that precedes him it it tells you something about him so you're going to get what you expect and it says in Proverbs 13:22 a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children and wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just this good man is able he has something of value that is not going to be spent by the Next Generation but can be enjoyed by the third generation and you'll find that this value is Faith this valuable thing is character it is the word of God it is something uh uh that can stand no matter how much someone would try to tear it down just think of all the opponents that have been against scripture and against Jesus Christ and all those that have attacked Christianity and tried to profane the prophets it still continues because that's the wealth can be uh take Stripped Away and certain things can be stripped away but it's the word of God that will ever remain and a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children that's that good name a legacy brother Bram in the sermon time tested Memorials of God he said speaking of all the Caesar and and all these different War veterans and leaders of times past he said their memorials are gone but that Living Word of God Still Remains just the same and just as valuable he said that's a memorial remember a name is a memorial of identification it's an identity here it is the testimony of the word of God that will remain it will stick someone could earn a billion dollars in a lifetime and leave it to their children and their children can waste it to where the grandchildren never get to see any of it but if that man lived above reproach and testified to the word of God and had a testimony that something that grandchildren can enjoy despite the best efforts of the generation in between and you know that happen that's happened in this day that there's many who heard about the message and accepted the message and begin to raise children in the message a a and and then they they their children have grandchildren and that middle generation back back slides and goes away but there's grandchildren that come to the light and come to the word of God and hold to it because there's something that's greater than a squandered inheritance of money a and and high living and things of this world he said I say today brother the things that you do the words that you say how you treat your neighbor and what you do about C about Christ will be an everlasting Memorial uh if you want to kind of jot it down to the side just how you treat your neighbor keep that in mind but he's saying the things you say and do how you treat your neighbor what you do about Christ will be an everlasting Memorial he says you might have a fine home to leave your children you might be working for some livelihood to lead for your children but I'd rather leave them the word of God than anything else he said those houses will vanish so much of our efforts maybe especially as men are in making sure that we could secure a dwelling place for our wives and for our children and get it paid off and enjoy vacations and do a lot of things that will waste away and won't remain and I question what are we doing I'm asking what are you doing to invest in the word of God so that there's an inheritance that they can look to and enjoy in the word he says leave for them a memorial and he says your testimony so it's not a bank account that we want to leave it's not a perfect a trust that's set up just right and and though there's a lot of wisdom in Estate Planning and those different things but there's an estate that we ought to be laboring for there's an estate that we can be investing in that has nothing to do with worldly finances and I I think that kind of that I hope that summarizes a little bit about where his name dwells and and how that there's a there there's something that we can be pursuing it's about character where his character is and so A Home of Honor if you could turn to Luke chapter 8 A A A Home of Honor speaks I I want to address uh honesty and humility this this home of Honor what I kind of was led into this and all these different things that kind of begin to intersect is that if God's there you would expect to see his characteristics there that in the in the house of the Lord there's Mercy because he's a god of Mercy in in the house of the Lord there there there is Justice because he's a God of Justice and there's different things that you could begin to expect in terms of characteristics of a house because the one that owns it and the one that's there and so I begin to think of ourselves as vessels of honor and our homes being honorable homes and this these characteristics of honesty and humility and that's what I'm aiming for but I actually want to use hypocrisy and selfishness to highlight that honesty and humility so in Luke chapter 8:1 15 this is part of where I'm getting this A Home of Honor these these descriptive terms this is the parable of the sewer the sewer Goes Forth and sews good seed and it falls on different types of ground or ground in different conditions on the Wayside uh in a Stony ground in ground that had weeds in it and other things that would grow up and then there was good ground that it finds and it says here in Luke 8 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience this is very practical and should be literally happening in your life all the time where you the word is sown you hear the word of God then you keep it and bring forth the fruit of it so the one who hears receives gladly if we look at some of the the the whole Parable itself then keeps it and then patiently brings forth perfect fruit of the word think of these elements you're able to hear the word of God gladly receive the word of God do the word of God be patient in doing and then enjoy the perfect fruit of the word of God that's it's a whole picture there and it is is a beautiful description of the Christian Life That's one that will hear the word of God gladly receive it keep it not just in their hearts but in obedience to it so you're living it out and then as you persevere and are diligent to continue in good things and continue to live the word you're going to enjoy the fruits of it it's descriptive of the Christian Life in that the results that you ultimately bear match the word that was sown that you don't say oh I'm a Christian I'm a Christian and it's a fountain of bitterness and hostility lying and cheating and stealing but the word which is Christ has been swn into your hearts and so Christ is what is expressed out it says an honest heart we're talking about an individual even how we dealt with how we want to make our hearts his home but this honesty speaks of Excellence uh to be an honest heart is an excellent precious Choice surpassing admirable suitable so in an honest heart I know that we could think uh maybe solely from the point of a maybe we just think honest means it's going to tell us the truth and that's definitely part of it but it's something that is excellent and suitable it's excellent in its nature and its character I know we use this definition recently and and since it's honest it can be used for what it's rep represents itself to be it's suitable for its purpose it's approved and in these definitions and in the use of the words it means it's free from fraud in other words it's honest in that what maybe what you see is like oh that sure looks like a good Hammer I I I'm going to take that and use it as a hammer and you grab it it's just a wobbly piece of plastic like well this isn't going to do me any good in other words it's free from fraud it's genuine and not misleading so an honest T is one that's genuine there's no false appearances there's no deceit so an honest is kind of what you see is what you get and sometimes I guess it could be good for and for bad so an honest heart is genuine it's honest in that it's suitable for what it's represented to be there's no false appearances there's no dishonesty if you want to look at it that it doesn't lie it doesn't deceive it doesn't trick you it's genuine and it's in its nature and its character therefore it's approved and fit for use it's an honest heart and a good heart this word good means upright or honorable so it speaks of something being distinguished and of good character and good nature those two words together an honest and good heart this is Honorable this honorable honest and good this sincere genuine and honorable heart and this heart is one that is the opposite of hypocritical and selfish and and if there's if the antonym to that if you think about it think well it seems like somewhat of a stretch I don't I'm not ever trying to be really contrived when I want to make a sermon fit uh so hopefully it'll make some sense to you to where it's not like I'm just choosing words and and they're not lining up but an honest and good heart it's honorable and one who's honorable has certain characteristics and what they are not is they're not hypocritical and what they are not is selfish and though there's a lot of ways we could have built the foundation better I felt that I I wanted to begin to walk through this Parable in Luke chapter 16 and so it's from this that I'm taking this thought of an honest home A A A Home of Honor rather and I want to contrast it by this rich man that we read about in Luke chapter 16 I be I was just I was studying him recently just begin to think about his house his home life and and what it must have been like because the the message of the hour in the scripture give us a unique glimpse into this rich man's life so all to are we all together now okay so I'm not sure just how much we'll preach this how much we'll get through it but I want to bring some things out and just fellowship with you on this verse 19 there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day you'll find in some readings and in the uh Latin Vulgate and some places that the word the Latin word used for rich man is Dives and so actually some people just call them Dives and that's just exactly what I'll say uh to keep it short so that we're not just always saying a certain rich man but it's Dives is what he's referred to and he's clothed in purple fine linen and Fa sumptuously every day so if we were to see a painting of his life or a snapshot or a picture of his life we would think this guy got it going on he's doing things right this is somebody I want to be or when I grow up I want to be like him there might be a lot to be enviable because he dresses well he eats well and he's a rich man now as we've already touched on in mark 4: 19 Jesus when he's given the parable of the SE he says that some of it fell into the grounds where there was there was Weeds and there was Briars and there's other things growing in the ground and the ground seemed like uh it could support life and nurture that seed but with other things growing in there Jesus called them the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in he said choke the word and it becometh unfruitful and I want you to take this phrase the deceitfulness of riches and apply it to the rich man to see because we've already read the outcome of the story a and and recognize just how deceiving riches are the the riches not only do they corrupt but they also can cover up bad character because here is a rich man that as we read about it we're left we we realize that he's going to end up in hell and be tormented and so with all his gning and gaining and all his luxuries and his fine eating and his nice clothes he he G gives the appearance of blessing he gives the appearance of wisdom and having it all put together but yet there's something missing on the inside so Di's luxury was in no there was no indication of character by his fine linen and being clothed in purple there there's no uh indication or signaling no identification of morality because of his riches you could not conclude based upon those things that are mentioned a rich man who's dressed nicely and eats well and his life is luxurious you could not say God has blessed him the Bible says in proverbs 10 chap 2 verse 22 the blessing of the Lord it maketh rich now it it's not saying that riches are the blessing of the Lord but the blessing of God the favor of God to be pleasing to the Lord that's riches those are the things that make us wealthy those are the things that will support us in a time of need I've never seen the righteous forsaken or God seed beg for bread not because he's wealthy but because God blesses him and he says and he addeth no sorrow with it whereas we could say that riches and the Love of Money pierces us through with many Sorrows so there's a deceitfulness of riches and there's a not only will riches corrupt but it covers bad character I want you to remember that because I'm not saying this so that we could be critical of elong musk and Jeff Bezos and some of these other guys cuz we're we're still thinking maybe one time they'll stream and tithe the little bit but we're wanting you to be uh self-examine and think of yourself in the sense that how much do I let the riches of Leo DEA and the blessings and the accumulation of Honor in the world kind of plate me and satisfy me and I'm not allowed to be challenged by the word of God to say I can do better at the very least I can do better or maybe what we really need to wake up to is I'm doing wrong the fact that I do these things and accomplish these things and have these things should not L me to sleep into thinking that I'm right I'm doing wrong or I can do better I I want to point this out I think I'll just make reference to it I don't know that I have it on the slides but as I was studying this last week it says that he was rich clothed in purple and fine linen now you could take those things even this fair sumptuously you could take these characteristics and start looking at them in scripture and in my mind I immediately began to think about uh uh The Babylon in Revelation 18 where there's this merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and Pearl and fine linen and purple silk Scarlet all like wood manners of vessels of Ivory and vessels of the most precious wood brass iron and marble and this was this beautiful woman and we know that these appearances as the Bible says are deceitful because she was the cage of every foul spirit and unclean bird but yet she's dressed in fine linen and purple so in my mind I'm thinking wow they the rich man is identified with Babylon but then in the Book of Esther after Mori has stood his ground and he raised up Esther properly and he has they've weathered the storm and that Feast of Pim where Esther said let my people stand and fight for themselves and morai emerges victoriously it says that he went out of the presence of the king in Royal apparel blue and white with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple the whole city rejoiced and was glad and I thought my what mixed signals we have that on one hand you see the Harlot dressed this way but then you could see the same things fine linen which is the righteousness of the Saints and the purple which is indicative of royalty there's there's something beautiful about fine linen and purple but yet it in itself cannot signal to us exactly what a person's made of is the rich man righteous or is is he Wicked is he blessed or is he cursed would we place him as Revelations 18 with the mystery Babylon the great would we place him with Mori on this day of great rejoicing and feasting is he good or is he evil now I'm asking the question because I believe we have an answer but in by snapshot her appearance you can ask yourself what what what is he Jesus says a certain rich man I believe Jesus had someone in mind right a certain rich man if I could say this Dives is a character of the Pharisees or he represents the Pharisees which were a character of the law they didn't really have the heart of it but they put on The Heirs of it and if you're wondering how much I had to stretch to figure that out I just read verses 14 and 15 of the same chapter and Luke 16: 14 and 15 it says and the Pharisees also who were Covetous heard all these things and they derided him and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but God knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God Jesus has given them the parable of the unjust Steward and he has talked about how that you cannot serve two masters you cannot serve God in Mammon so his subject matter is about riches and when begins to talk about riches and the wealth of this world and he says you can't you can't serve that and serve God the the Pharisees who were covetousness who are Covetous deride him so this Parable that we read begin to read in verse 19 is commentary of this jealousy this self-justification and this hypocrisy of the Pharisees when he gives a parable he's responding to their derision he's responding to their jealousy and self-justification and when it says they were Covetous the word means they were lovers of money they loved money not God they loved money not truth you'll find sometimes that people like the gospel because the blessings that are attached with it and not necessarily Christ who is the gospel himself they don't have this attitude of Abandonment to say there is one truth and I I'd rather be right than and than to have the world and I'd rather be saved than to be lost and have the whole world and their attitude isn't regardless and no matter what the cost there's one true God his son gave his life for my sins and in him I want to be found they want the healing that comes with it they want the rejoicing that comes with it they want popularity that comes with it they want the social things that come with it but those who are sold out to God are willing to just have him in nothing else and so this these Pharisees were lovers of money not of God so they sneered at Christ's teaching on riches said you can't serve God in Mammon and they thought well that's exactly what we're doing that's exactly why we're doing it we love being priests because of the access it gives us we love being Pharisees because the opportunities we have we love being looked to as Masters and teachers and and having this great power but he says you cannot serve both and he says that you justify yourselves before men the self-justification they put on Heirs of righteousness before men but inwardly God knows their hearts and they are corrupt and what they esteem outwardly God finds yet as it as an Abomination because God sees the heart man will see the the the outside and like oh man dives what a great guy I'm going to name my son Dives and and in that see something that you would admire but God sees his heart and says this is an Abomination it is an Abomination that he lives this way that he expresses things this way because his life leads to hell and we're we're Desiring to be Dives and we see the example of Lazarus we're telling our kids whatever you do don't be a Lazarus be a Dives right there's this you want to be a rich man you want to do this you want to do that and we'll do everything to set our children up so that they can succeed in life so that they won't be Lazarus but really at the end of the day we've we've we've kind of looked at the wrong things and one's an Abomination and the other is God's blessing out let me reinforce that the parable of the rich man and the beggar the rich man I believe and I'm asserting and you don't have to just take this for what I'm saying I believe it's Jesus is using the certain rich man as a representation of Pharisees because God knows their hearts but they justify themselves outwardly but inwardly they're an Abomination now you'll see that Jesus makes this connection quite a bit in his teachings in Matthew chapter 23 vers 23 to 28 wo un you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and Anis and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith they they tithe on spice they're they're cutting like you need to tithe this and they're really really precise when it comes to these ties of mint and cumin and Anis and he says but on the waiter matters of the law and things such as Justice mercy and Faith he says you've omitted it you're you're super legalistic on some things and completely en licens on others I I think that's a mark of things that aren't right some people can be so adamant about some things and completely disregard the word and other things and and if we're not careful what we do is we reject the things that they're legalist about and become legalist on the things they reject and we're no better because Jesus says you ought to have done these things and not leave the other undone and so it's not that just oh don't worry about tithing on men and cuming don't be so legalistic don't be so precise it's like yeah do do that but don't leave out the bigger things so he says you blind guides which strain it a n and swallow a camel and then again this is I think that kind of ties back to the comment that you'll cut hairs on these things and strain on these things and then swallow a camel in the next bite why would you scribes Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they're full of extortion and excess this is his assessment of scribes and Pharisees they're Hypocrites outwardly things look good inwardly extortion and excess W un you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites if you're like un Whited supplers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even that image of a a supper because it would be wrong and unlawful for a Jew to touch a touch a grave or supper they washed them white and they made them stand out so you knew to avoid them and Jesus is saying Pharisees do the same thing to be distinguished and you should avoid them likewise he says even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity this is who Jesus is talking about or rebu rebuttal or refuting these that were Covetous and derided him because of his teaching on the unjust Steward in riches and how you ought to put God first first and serve God first he calls them Hypocrites the word means an actor a stage player hypocrite means a pretender the words in its roots speak of to feain something to impersonate or play the part this ought to have some weight for us to think of it that way scribes and Pharisees are all actors scribes and Pharisees read the script because the scribes transcribed the words the Pharisees studied it and so they knew it and what they did is they mimic it they impersonate it they have read and know that you need to tithe this much so they do it they have read and know that you need to conduct yourself this way so they do it they have all these things that seem to be figured out and they can put on the pretense of a life to where they're Justified before men but inwardly something's wrong hypocrisy is at the end of the day a mixed signal just as a certain rich man would have been esteemed within the community and thought to be blessed and thought to be rich and made lived his life in such a way to where it it suggested righteousness I don't have the statements here I was going to be holding this thought for Sunday morning but brother Brandon when he's preaching leadership and some other places he takes the story of the Rich Young Ruler who had kept the law perfectly in his Youth and then Jesus said one thing thou lackest and he went away sorrowful because he had great possessions so he and he says we find him later on in this parable of Lazarus and the rich man so the young the Rich Young Ruler is Dives and we find his Destiny later on what kind of leadership where did it lead him and led him to hell but if we could take those two stories together he keeps all those have I kept since my youth I know the word I know the message I know how it needs to be done and so there's a little bit of theater and a little bit of pretending that he can put on but he's it's playing the part because he doesn't have what he's purporting to have because in the end judged say it again it's a mixed signal hypocrisy we say to say one thing and do another but it's to say or do something that's inconsistent or contradictory to reality even in things that you do as God says I know your heart and you esteem these things outwardly but I know your heart it's hypocrisy you say these things and it sounds good but I know your heart it's Abomination Jesus therefore says in Luke 12:1 beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy hypocrisy is the sin of pretending to be good or virtuous you're pretending to be good you're pretending to be honest as one writer put it it's the art of affecting qualities for the person purpose of pretending to an undeserved virtue it's an art of portraying certain qualities for the purpose of making people think you have a a virtue you haven't earned or don't deserve the leav of the phes is hypocrisy it's the hypocrisy that corrupts and changes things leevan though small in quantity eventually through its power and its influence and its design will thoroughly pervade the whole thing as Galatians says A little leaven lenth the whole lump hypocrisy then he says is like leaven you can have it and miss it because it's so small it can exist without being detected immediately or easily but eventually it pervades entirely and once it has its effect it puffs up with pride and vanity but in the end no more greater substance has been added is that not what's so with all the bakers that are here and those who when you add yeast to something in its quality at the time it has all the same components and it's just one small little ball but just let time pass and eventually the leaven causes the same thing to be puffed up it's no different in nature it's no different in character but now the leaven has caused it to appear to appear bigger you and different so that's that's the analogy that Christ is using that this Le the leaven of the Pharisees is hypocrisy hypocrisy causes them to swell up with pride hypocrisy causes them to boast and to put on erors and pretense and to look like they have it all together and to look like they're rich to look like they're blessed but in fact they are not I like to point out the emptiness of the leaven of hypocrisy in job 8: 13-15 so are the paths of all that forget God this would be the reprobate the Heathen the UN the unrighteous and the Hypocrites hope Shall Perish whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be as a spider's web he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure why it's a house of cards it's a house that's been made out of hay it's a house that has just been put together quickly built upon the sand not established upon a rock the Hypocrites hope what he trust in will perish he'll lean upon his house but he's built it through hypocrisy and it will fail him he'll try to hold it fast but it will not endure the hypocrite here is the one who's corrupted with the leav of hypocrisy or pretense listen pretending acting impersonating will fail you and I think that's the grace of God you should be happy if you're in a relationship uh with your spouse or with your children or with others to where you can only pretend for so long before Things Fall Apart and you got to get real and you got to get serious and that's the grace of God cuz pretending will only make you go so far because hypocrisy is empty it's vanity there's no virtue in hypocrisy there's no strength in hypocrisy there's no support in hypocrisy it has no valuable substance the Hypocrites hope will perish it's like leaning on a spider's web you try to trust in this house of cards that you build it will not stand you can try to hold it fast it'll wither away because there's nothing to it hypocrisy is a huge subject I believe that Jesus when he calls out this certain rich man he's calling out his his his hypocrisy because it's the Pharisees that were Hypocrites James chapter 3: 13 to 18 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom so if one is wise let him demonstrate so by the way he lives and may it be the meekness of wisdom not somebody who's the wealthiest there's this I say this I mean I believe I'm stating the obvious but there's times in our lives where if we want advice or we want to know how to do something we we identify the person that we think is successful uh in worldly things or or in finances or whatever and that's the person we want to go to to get wisdom but that in itself isn't the wisdom that God's talking about that's not the wisdom that we should be looking four says but if you have bitter envy and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this should be this should be something that we always examine ourselves by if there's bitter Ian or Strife in our hearts there should be we should not Glory or lie against the truth those things are not right we cannot justify bitterness we cannot justify Envy this wisdom of envy and in bitterness descends not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for envy and strife is there's confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be in treated full of mercy and good fruits this is a Lous test for decisions that we make the way that we're viewing a situation the way that we're perceiving a situation whether we're hearing something being told to us or whether we're wanting to express things ourselves How Does It Strike your Palace is it bitter is it pure is it Peaceable is it gentle is it easy to be in treated is it full of mercy and good fruits does it tend to these things or does it delve us further into sensuality earthliness devilishness Strife bitterness and then he uses these phrases and I've gone down this path through these very familiar verses to get to this phrasing without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is swn in peace of them that make peace to be be without partiality it's you're not self-righteous or self-serving I it's a it's it's not being selfish there's no guile or evil in uh selfish intent you're willing to give what's due because it's due and not withhold it without partiality wisdom which is from above is not partial it's not self-righteous it's not self-serving it it is and it says it's without hypocrisy it does not pretend it is not simulated wisdom from above doesn't say well I need to do this because I'll be perceived as right if I do it does it because it's right that we though we would avoid the appear the very appearance of evil we are no more righteous if we do things solely for parents sake but when we to the wisdom from above is not self-serving and it's not done for parents' sake to think of the ways that we sometimes present ourselves because we know it's right but yet in our hearts we don't really agree with it as we ought to we're doing it just to be sure everything's covered and there's times and maybe I'm speaking this personally so Lord just help me as it strikes me there's times in our in your life where whether it be family or even people who profess to believe the message they just are who they are and they're not going to pretend around you even if that means that they just say what they want to say dress how they want to dress live how they want to live and for some of us we might think well how dare them and that's disrespectful and and there's a part that can really grade on us but I'm just saying this out loud as a person but sometimes I can appreci appreciate the fact that I know where they're standing and I know where they're at whereas with other people you're like I don't know about this guy I mean it's like a 99% of the time everything's put together then all of a sudden something happens you're like wow where did that come from and so this this is the hypocrisy of the Pharisees this certain rich man he is not without partiality he is not without hypocrisy notice the depths of this hypocrisy it says in Proverbs 11:9 a hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbor but through knowledge shall the just be delivered the word their hypocrite it's even as it's used in job kind of in the Hebrew language they use the term hypocrite but it speaks of an Infidel or one that rejects divine revelation and and so it's not just solely maybe somebody uh who's dishonest but yet the scripture itself shows us this principle of hypocrisy that it leads astray and it will corrupt the character of others because the hypocrite is going to use words to his neighbor gonna flatter gonna say things gonna entice gonna encourage gonna put on things to entice the the the the neighbor to see things or do things or to act in a way that won't ultimately benefit him and so the hypocrite through his words will corrupt the character of his neighbor but it says knowledge will deliver the just so knowledge is the anecdote the antidote to hypocrisy truth is the antidote to hypocrisy this honesty is what overcomes hypocrisy that hypocrisy even has in its meaning to answer for someone or to speak for someone and it has this idea that you're playing and you're putting on the part and I'm going to speak as if I'm the one that's doing it but I'm just acting I'm just is playing the part and so if you are if you're hypocrisy you're kind of given an answer that you think is right but yet when we're honest we give an honest answer like I that I'm I'm needy I'm dishonest I I make mistakes I need help it's the truth honesty it's one of these characteristics I'm wanting to identify in a A Home of honor it speaks of Splendor honesty in in the Hebrew is honor the right kind of behavior your good manners if one is honest they're honorable the Bible says in Proverbs 18:12 Before Destruction the heart of a man is hotti pride goeth before a fall he's presumptuous he's arrogant he's Vain and before honor is humility before there can be honor there must be meekness power under control to have this kind of humility here to a Hebrew it means you're not self asserting but you're respectful that's the characteristic of God to be respectful before honor is humility so I use this description and this characterization of a hypocrite and hypocrisy to describe the rich man the rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day Dives had a reputation and he had a testimony that might have signaled one thing but I'm saying deep down inside he didn't have what some people would think he had he is the Pharisee which is a hypocrite whitewashed and pleasant on the outside but inside full of hypocrisy and iniquity Dives is a hypocrite but a rich one but yet a hypocrite and in verse 20 now we see this direct contradiction or contrast a rich man dives was clothed in purple and fine linen fared sumptuously every day but then Jesus says and and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus you'll notice that the rich man is have is given a name later by in Tradition using a Latin term that is not a proper name but yet it's a word that means rich man but yet this man has a name the rich man has not given any name and I believe it's done so that you could just identify the spirit and not get hung up on the name but here this the certain Beggars given a name and the name does speak of something the name means God is my help and a certain beggar named Lazareth which was laid at his gate that means he would have had to have been carried he needed to be carried to be laid at the gate this man was rich enough to have a house with a gate he was laid he needed to be carried full of sores he's in other words these sores are are are not treated or bound and he would have been glad to eat the crumbs from Di's table wouldn't mind eating at a dive desired to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores they're open they're festering and Jesus adds this and it makes the scene even more pitiful here's a man that cannot help himself so he is laid at the rich man's gate and he's placed here that by Chance the rich man would have mercy on him but the scripture is silent as to whether or not he ever was able to enjoy any Crumbs from uh Di's table or whether or not he was ever given any kind of consideration and it just says that that the dog show more pity on this man than the rich man and it is remarkable especially to a Jew to say that a dog behaved better than a Pharisee because a dog would be one of the worst things you could be called if you were a practicing Jew but Lazareth who means God is my help it means he was a good man I believe that Jesus in the short words that he uses he tells us where he ends up and he says things about Lazareth and where he ultim ions up that can tell us that he was living by God's help he trusted in the Lord and I know that it is a paradox and it's a difficult picture maybe to find uh uh to to rationalize with that if you were to draw it out of a rich man clothed and fine linen and purple eating the best that his the his region had to offer in a house behind the gate and then you drew a picture of a a poor man a feeble Man full of sores and dogs licking his sores and he's starving and he's and he's dying and the one at the gate trust in God and the one behind the G behind the gate trusted in riches one was blessed and one was cursed that's why that's why you say that hypocrisies at work or pretense is probably the better word that I could use all things are not as they appear every day Dives had an opportunity to feel lazarus's pain not literally but empathetically if not empathetically sympathetically every day as this beggar was carried to the gate and laid there and if he would be taken away at night or how that it would have worked every day the rich man had an opportunity to be touched by the poverty of Lazarus every day when he passed by and I believe it's the part of the image that Christ would want us to consider is he laid at the gate not in the alley not down the street but it was in a place to where this rich man would have have opportunity to see him time and time again and the rich man every day maybe twice a day would have been challenged to lower himself to see him as deserving of mercy and to give to show some mercy some compassion to do to give some good to Lazarus in Matthew chapter 23 Jesus speaking about the hypocritical Pharisees and Des cribes as we've already read verses 23 to 28 this is before that he had already been burning them quite a bit he says neither be you called Masters for one is your master even Christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted what what anchors what a foundation to what he begins to say about hip Hypocrites who've omitted the weigher matters of the law Hypocrites who make clean the outside but are full of extortion and excess Hypocrites who outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly they're full of hypocrisy and iniquity why he says you make yourself to be something instead of making your lowering yourself to be a servant humble yourself to be exalted but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them in is up for them that are entering to go in that key of knowledge as it were that they said that they had they have hid they've hid the access to the kingdom woe un you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayer and therefore you shall receive the greater damnation who would you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you Compass sea and land to make one proelite and when he is made you make him twofold more the child of Hell than yourselves wow these are pretty sick Burns right kids I mean these are mic drop moments this is he's spitting hot fire I think is what the uh the homies say this he says you Compass sea and land to make a convert and when you've converted him he's twice the child of hell as you are in other words you're a child of Hell yourself pretense Pride you make the pretense of a long prayer the way that they present themselves and show themselves now I I have purposely left my notes short tonight so that I could have more time to delve into selfishness and kind of find something that would bridge the gap between this hypocrisy but I I want to say this now and I I I could end with pointing these things out Dives let his richual obscure the truth he let his success in the world hide him from his true needs one thing thou lackest he thought eternal life and comfort and safety could be found in in the the the possessions of this world but once exposed he let his wealth obscure his true need but if I could say this about Lazar he never let his poverty change what he ought to pursue I believe that we could take from Luke chapter 16 and say that Lazarus did not try to serve God in Mammon he served God Alone that Lazarus himself had put God first so he could be committed to True riches because Dives is rich in Optics but poor where it counted in character in verse 22 it says it came to pass pass that the beggar died and was carried by Angels into Abraham's bosom this is all you need to know when he died he was carried by Angels into paradise and Jesus says the rich man also died and was buried in other words there's no Paradise for this one verse 23 and in Hell the rich man dives lifts up his eyes and he's tormented he sees Abraham a far off this picture this Father Abraham is a picture of paradise and Lazareth is in his bosom he's been comforted he's at rest he's at PE he's in this glorious Paradise that every that the Jews would have been that some would have believed in and longed for and he cried the dive says Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I'm tormented in this flame we'll come back to amplify that maybe Sunday and Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime reest thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he's comforted thou are tormented in the final analysis how many of us well I guess maybe you could say guts or gumption or faith would you be willing to accept lazarus's lot in life so that you could have his Destiny now I have often joke brother brandom turned down millions of dollars and I've joked that you know what I wouldn't mind being tempted with it you know just to see how I handle it but the reality is it's kind of just joking the reality is would you tempt yourself to be be a rich man and think that you could fare better would be would you be willing to do it I I I I know I know what the Bible says and if I was a Rich Young Ruler I wouldn't make the same mistake that he made when he stood before Christ I I I would do that I would sell all I have and give to the poor and I would follow him and and how is it that you find yourself rationalizing I know when I say riches we might think purely of cash in the bank and but I you to think about richness in the world a and and having things that we enjoy in the riches I've been reading different statements where brother brandom is constantly identifying the spirit and attitude of Leo DEA and we don't have to be Filthy Rich it's just Leo DEA provides us with so many things that are luxuries you know what we call luxuries of the 18th century you know what we call them today basic human rights that's what they've become people's rights L to see I have a basic human right to the internet highp speeed to a base income right I have a human these are the my basic human rights that I should have a house I should have an internet I should have a phone I should have this I should have that I I'm ow it and I'm do it just because I'm a human and therefore All Humans should uh collectively work in order that we would all have these basic human rights it's the soft living of leod deia Dives received good things Lazarus evil things but one was tormented in the end the other one comforted in Matthew chapter 6: 1-6 speaking of the Hypocrites the Pharisees which I believe I'm using today the rich man as a Pharisee the one that was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day Jesus says take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven let me let me back up I I I think maybe I'm I'm going too fast and I just need to I need to add some background to this we we don't see either man's home life do we Dives or Lazarus but it could be safe to say that Lazarus is unhoused but Dives as homeless that Lazarus in life received evil things but yet he trusted in God and in the end he's comforted he's in Paradise he makes it home but yet the rich man though he had a house and it was beautiful and he fared sumptuously and he lived well and he was comforted by things in life and Jesus said he received good things in this lifetime but yet he's not committed the true riches he we could say he has a house but he has no home and we could make certain conclusions based upon what he did outside the gate we can have we can make some conclusions about what was going on inside the gate because we're not able to necessarily look in and peek in through the the window and see how Dives is treating his wife how he's raising his children what he does in his private time and how he is when nobody is looking but yet we have an opportunity to see him every morning and every evening as he passes by Lazarus to see what he does to his neighbor to find out what his testimony really is and you can conclude based upon what he does outside the gate you can pretty be pretty safe about what he's doing inside the gate am I making sense now the way a man is outside of his home begins with the way he is in his home the way a man is privately is most likely going to be the way that he'll end up publicly and if he's not he is a hypocrite a man that yells at his wife and speaks softly to his friends is a hypocrite a man that is selfish towards his children and gen generous towards his buddies is a hypocrite so there are conclusions that you can make ultimately and he says don't do your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven I've wrestled with this and wrestled with this feeling like it's it's a picture that I I I feel like I see in my mind but I can't explain it I'm just trusting the Lord will make this make sense to you therefore when thou doest thine arms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and the streets that they may have Glory of men there's always an audience with the hypocrite verily I say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left how know what thy right hand doeth that thine arms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men here's your rich man verily I say unto you they have their reward now in our minds we're thinking the fine linen and the purple and the fair ins sumptuously and the big house and the gates and everything that they've been rewarded but no that's not their reward their reward is torment but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet remember that secret chamber where Pleasant riches are and when thou has shut the door thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee open openly I'm I am addressing hypocrisy and selfishness focused more on the hypocrisy today and Jesus says that in public they pray they do their alms they do it as he says that they may have Glory of men honor of men that they may be seen of men and what is happening on the street corner is all for theater so they're Hypocrites so when no one is watching they don't do those things when nobody else will know they won't give when nobody else when when it's not going to be retweeted right this is this is the problem with all these viral videos of people doing something for homeless people it's all it's it's Pharisees that that's what's happening they think oh man these guys are really really nice you know I I mean his name is Mr Beast and I think we joked one time in the music room like what is that say right the mark of the beast and I can't remember what the joke was I think it was brother Loy that had it and if I remember it I'll have to owe him loyalties what oh it was the mark of the Mr Beast that's what it was but when you think about all these things they do they do it for clicks they do it for income now now some of us can be happy that the blind see and the deaf hear because of Mr Beast but remember at the end of the day he's not righteous he's doing it for the views he's doing it for the followers he's doing it to make money and as long as we view he'll make more money and so there's a there's a certain pretense that if you couldn't video it if you couldn't get some Karma or some clout or you couldn't go viral would people do it anyways why is it when they pay it forward they've already pushed record why is it when they're doing something nice they've got to have a camera running because it's the age of Pharisees it's the age of age of acting it's l to see the age of pretending even if it's doing good it's for show but then there's and I'm and I'm making the point that if the camera's not on if people can't see what are you doing Dives was outwardly rich but inwardly poor he was a Pharisee he was an actor a pretender of one that kept the law because he kept the law legalistically but miss missed the heart of it a character of the law a character of Judaism a character of their faith in other words he didn't actually have it he didn't have the character of it he had the pretense of it he was long on religion and short on love last night in our devotion the book that we're reading as a family devotion is quoted in English Johan V Wen V go go this a writer and a philosopher it's written in German but this is I translated several times just to find exactly the right way to say it but he said Talent develops in quiet places character in the full current of human life I know that we have a saying that character is what you are when you're all alone and and I think that we use that as a way of challenging ourselves that what are you doing with nobody's looking because that's your true self and and therefore we're not putting weight on what we do outwardly and what we do for show and this doesn't necessarily turn on turn it on its head but there's something about character growing in being expressed in the daily living and that it says Talent develops in quiet places now this is the way that I've been meditating on it ever since we read it last night I was so struck by it and and we had some discussion as a family because you can think well what's talent and what's skill in these things and and the the the book that we're reading is spoke of the talents of prayer and different things that you do in secret and today as I was praying about it I I felt that it could be said this way it's not our private suffering or even the internal monologue we have with ourselves where we're telling ourselves we're good and we're good enough and in rationalizing with everything and well I said and we're already working out an excuse well I said this because of that and we're backtracking into what we did and we want to back our way into being righteous like misspelling mortgage and then trying to come up with how that actually is something even more spiritual to make myself look good are forgetting that it was not CS Lewis but it was CS Lucas that said that and so there's different things that we could do where we try to back ourselves into being right and it's all this it's private suffering it's what was me I'm the victim but the character that we're talking about is hearing receiving doing and waiting patiently for the word to come forth hearing receiving doing and being patient for the word to be expressed and honest and good heart is what brings honor and honest and good heart is the opposite of what is hypocritical and selfish and we say well where does this start it doesn't start through pretense it doesn't start on stage it doesn't start out there I'm going to go to work tomorrow and I'm going to impress everybody with my humility I I'm going to be a better person out there in the churchard under the under the in the foyer and under the awning I I'm going to be a real Christian now it starts in your closet so that it can make a difference in your bedroom so that that can make a difference in the dining room and kitchen so that that can make a difference outside your gate you'll never treat Lazarus well correctly until you first find that secret place inwardly where Talent develops in solitude of prayer and patience and faith in sympathy and sweetness and then our character grows as we step out outside of the closet and we begin to interact now are you listening to me this this the prayer and this dedication that's when you be there's something that is being developed but your real character grows when You Face your spouse the real character begins to manifest when You Face your children the real character begins to manifest when you step outside your house into the street and you're confronted with Lazarus the beggar at your feet it must start somewhere A Home of Honor it's an honest house it's an unselfish house as much as you are able to make this practical I admonish you to do so could we stand and bow our heads
