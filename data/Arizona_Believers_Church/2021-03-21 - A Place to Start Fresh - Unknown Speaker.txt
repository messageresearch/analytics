TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ezra chapter 9 verses 5 to 9 and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment in my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the lord my god and said o my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespasses grown up unto the heavens since the days of our fathers have we been in great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day and now for little space grace have been showed from the lord our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little revive and in our bondage for we were bond men yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof they give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem amen you can be seated our thought this morning is a a place to start fresh and it kind of carries it with the idea of stopping and starting over again but that's uh that's the title that we have as a place to start fresh and the lord had been dealing with my heart on this particular subject and then i received a notice thanks to the almighty google that yesterday was the first day of spring and it it just kind of helped things form in my mind and just see how these things were all the timing was very uh pertinent to where we are now the uh it being the first day of spring that you can just even ponder the different elements of spring now that it's officially at least in terms of the calendar spring time and when we think of springtime we think of ideas of something being reborn or springing forth we think of renewal and regeneration we think of it in terms of the passover this time of year we think of resurrection or exodus or regrowth and literally what is happening is the earth begins to tilt and its access to where the the northern hemisphere is getting a little bit closer to the sun and snow is melting and the earth is warming up and daylight increases and as it warms this causes new life to spring up it causes new growth it causes plants to to grow and that's why they give it this time of year give it this name it means to to spring forth or to spring up in job chapter 38 verse 27 says to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth and that's what the name spring uh when we use this time springtime or to spring forth it's talking about things budding to spring forth to sprout or to grow up and this is what time of year when new life is appearing things are greening things are blooming things are flowering and so that's why springtime is often referred to as a time of renewal or gives a feeling of a fresh start if things are just being born and uh having never experienced life before having never butted we think in terms of innocence and a new beginning and this is this is kind of what the springtime even means to us as people we talk about doing some spring cleaning and it's like starting all over with our house and getting things clean doing things that it should have been done for a long time or maybe doing things we had never done before and the same image is painted in isaiah chapter 43 verses 18 to 19 where it says remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold i this is god now i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth and there's a there's a a connection with what we were ministering last time in terms of suddenly and why not now and how that we ought to believe that god can in a moment change something and how that if you've been sick your entire life you still should have the belief in faith that suddenly you can be healed if someone a loved one has not been saved and you've been telling this truth for decades you still should have a faith to believe that suddenly everything changes and so you have the same image in mind when he says i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth there's a suddenness to it and there is such a suddenness and an unexpectation to it he says shall ye not know it in other words if i do a new thing and it springs forth you're going to see it it's going to even maybe be startling to you because he says i will even make a way in the wilderness so there's gonna be a path made where it was desolate where there should not be a way where there would not be a traveled path he's saying i'm going to make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert and we ought not to let our experience here in phoenix defeat that faith that there are rivers there can be rivers in the desert there can be something streaming forth and a place that's desolate and dry and there's been no water god's gonna say i'm gonna do something and you say well this is odd there shouldn't be a river here this is a place that's very dry this is a a place which is not characterized uh as desert it wouldn't even be like us where we have canals and washes and we would expect maybe at some time there'd be water in it he said this is a wasteland this is a desert of sand but yet god gonna make a way where there's rivers and streams in the desert and so in this uh the title we're giving it a place to start fresh it's it's a place to start anew to begin again it's a place to start over and i'll be very it's gonna be very simple very and very direct and and i know these things are foundational but i believe they ought to be a part of our experience as individuals so it should it could serve just to refresh some of us in the experience that we had and that we've been enjoying and then also it would be challenging to our young people uh and to those who god is just now dealing with and they're being brought to the light of the truth and god is dealing with their hearts so it's very foundational and fundamental in terms of salvation and then i believe it's also instructive to us as the body that we as as we begin as a church we want certain things to be a part of our fabric we want to identify certain things that are in our dna and what we are as a body and i believe this fits very well with that and so as job says and it speaks of something springing forth and then god saying i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth and even what we'll come to here in a moment as we've read in ezra the scriptures are touching on something that is deep within all of our hearts it's something that's part of the human condition and that's the allure or the power that we believe a fresh start has and i think that all of us can relate to this regardless of where we are in terms of our life experience or what our hobbies are our passions are what our level of cleanliness is or what our endeavors may be there's something about beginning again and starting over that holds a strong attraction to us and it's a psychological phenomena and that it exists within our minds that causes us or motivates people to begin to do something that where there is a an opportunity to start over or something happens and you you view this as your chance to begin afresh and it's it's a psychological feeling where now i feel free and i have the liberty to do something that i otherwise wouldn't have done before or right now i feel that i have this liberty or i have a starting point i have a place from which i can begin and it's a way that we just fill in our minds because it's not that somebody you know the starting pistol fired or the light turned green it's like now is your chance it's just something happens and it becomes this mark in our minds like now's my chance to start again and so a start is initiated after what the psychologist would call or the academics would call a temporal landmark so there's some landmark that's established in your mind and once it's established that represents to you the point of departure the the point of demarcation where from this point on things are going to be different and it becomes a place where you say right now is a new beginning and you divide things from that moment from this point on things are different anything that happened before well that's not in the consideration that's not in the picture i'm starting from this point and i'm going forward and what happens is again this is kind of psychological this is within our thinking and how we feel within our emotions it creates a clean slate in our mind like we don't have to consider decades of failure we don't have to consider years of bad habits so we don't have to consider just all the poor decisions that we've made over the last while we can say from this point on right now i'm starting all over and everything else in my mind i'm going to erase i'm not going to hold it on my account it's starting clean and it's a clean slate from this moment forward and temporal landmarks can be everything from the first day of spring like now that's the first day of spring i'm going to be sure to vacuum uh a room every day or now that it's the first day of spring i'm going to start getting my car washed on saturdays and you use this this day march 20th 2021 is the day which i began to do something and it's really just a temporal landmark there's nothing more really anything significant about it other than it's something that anchors in your mind and becomes a point of reference it can even be a birthday when you turn a certain age and you say from this point on it could be the beginning of a new school semester it could be the start of a new job there's all these different ways that we could have a landmark that becomes the the the foundation from which we're beginning something what we probably do the most often is we look at new year's a day as that point of this temporal landmark we're going to start things we're going to do things and just to use as this as an example uh so that you understand kind of where maybe my psychology is you'd always take the position well brother aaron thanks for letting us know how you think and uh it may be beneficial to you just to know where i'm coming from but they've done some research on this and one particular study found that if you're approaching a new decade in chronological age in other words if you're 39 turning 40 29 turning 30 yadda yadda yadda 69 turning 70 if you're approaching a new decade it causes people to begin to search their life for purpose and so i'm 39 years old i'm turning 40. now that i'm turning 40 you know what have i done in these 40 years and what have i accomplished and and is your 59 turning 60 we realize that these birthdays are the ones that loom very large when someone turns 40 it's what it lordy lordy look who's 40 and and you have everything's black on that day and then when they're turning 50 um there's it's something even in our minds about these zeros at the beginning of a new decade that create significant birthdays and they find that the people who are the nine enders 39 49 59 69 79 that they begin to ask themselves what have i done with my life and what have i accomplished and now that i'm starting a new decade it causes a period of reflection and consideration about where they are and what they've done and so what happens in this soul-searching the consequence of this looking within themselves and trying to figure out what have i done what have i accomplished it it inspires people to engage in meaningful activity or purpose giving or meaning seeking behaviors where i'm 39 years old i haven't done anything i'm going to run a marathon or i'm 49 years old and and and i have nothing to show for it so i'm gonna i'm gonna climb mount everest and people want to do something i want to start something i'm gonna start saving i'm gonna start doing i'm gonna start a hobby i'm gonna do this because they're they use this turning of age this new decade as a temporal landmark to start again and to do something an example that this one study used and they were looking at these different marathons so i didn't just kind of arbitrarily pull that out of a out of the ether but it says among 500 first-time marathon runners the nine enders people 29 39 49 represented over represented by 48 percent compared with age groups ending in a different digit so in a of 500 first-time marathon runners almost half of them were either 29 39 49 59 69 79 89 who maybe 99 who give me 109 and it's their first time running the marathon and what the researchers are saying is that because they're at that nine ender because they're at the threshold of another decade they're looking within themselves of this landmark that's approaching and they want to know have i done something have i accomplished something and it actually inspires people to for the first time to run a marathon have any of you ever been inspired to run a marathon i haven't checked with me when i'm turning 49 things may be a little bit different i don't even like to run errands let alone run a marathon and so i couldn't imagine myself running but yet people can be motivated and inspired oh uh this is this is something that i want to do and accomplish and it's all part of this thing in our minds this mechanism where we're looking for a fresh start and so this uh this psychology this way that our minds works it draws us to so now a fresh start a temporal landmark this turning of a new decade it creates or it draws us to the idea of a new beginning and if somebody said hey i'm going to give you a chance to start over in something here's your credit score we're going to let you start all over uh there's an alert to that there's an attraction to it there's a strong attraction to a fresh start and what it does is in our minds when we're drawn to this it gives us we're drawn to these new beginnings and these fresh starts to hope for something that things will be different this time it we can change something we can have something better and that this is gonna be for our good this is an opportunity for us to to excel and to achieve and so we've all used the language of starting tomorrow oh nobody here has okay think of your neighbor all right i got a better idea from this point on let's think of that person you know the one we're talking about and if and if uh and if you agree just go um yep amen that's right oh yeah exactly brother aaron or as my brother says all the time sure and i'm like is that good is that bad i mean they say something wrong sure right aaron but just so just think about somebody else if you need to but we say often let's start tomorrow starting tomorrow we're going to begin again starting to work we're going to start this starting tomorrow we're going to do this as a family starting tomorrow we're going to begin home school at 8 o'clock in the morning starting tomorrow and if it doesn't start at 8 o'clock in the morning you know what we'll do it next week right because we wanna there's we're looking for this point where we can begin and get into it and go and then we when we begin we say this time it's gonna be different right this time i'm actually going to refuse to eat fried foods this time i'm going to do this time i'm going to cut out diet drinks or sodas or whatever this time it's going to be different and we're making these promises to ourselves and why is it different this time because this is now oh that that that's in the past that was another time that doesn't apply and we can feel and things that have a lot more to do than just a diet and things like that but even very significant events happen in your lives and commitments we say this is i have a new lease on life i i was in bondage and this was happening and that was happening everything was going the wrong way but something happened and by these turns of events i feel like i have some breathing room i have a new lease on life and people will actually come to places in their lives where they feel i'm starting over i'm able to start from scratch everything that was hanging on to me everything that was tearing us down everything that was burning us we've somehow been able to get past it and i and i'm breathing again and i feel free and i feel liberty and you think now is a point now is a time where things can be different and we're going to go forward and so it's a it's a mindset and it's a mindset that we can have in different uh situations or scenarios or maybe there's a a couple and and they have been courting from some for some time and they love one another and they're dating and maybe the relationship has been rocky and maybe there's some things may be habits or behaviors or things that don't seem to be right or the relationships are always trying to work through something and they get engaged and in their minds that when we get married things will be different i'm not trying to cast dispersion or doubt on that whole concept i'm with you i support you newlyweds the newly engaged i believe things can be different suddenly he's very patient and kind as soon as the ring went on his finger but we we often think that way that now once we get married things are going to be different things will change there'll be a change of behavior and and he won't be away for two weeks at the world of warcraft convention in chicago uh once we get married things are going to change and and he won't have a call of duty basement or something things are going to be different and so there's this idea that once we cross a threshold once we do something things will change and then we could say even in that scenario of a newly married couple that well once we get a house once we get a house things will change or once he once this happens and once that happened and we have this way of thinking that there's these events that are going to happen they're going to afford us another opportunity to start all over again does that sound familiar right those people we're talking about you know that those neighbors those newly married neighbors in the apartment next door to us talking about the house they're going to buy and how everything's going to be different once they get new house that's who we're talking about so just relax having fun this morning it could be with the new job once i get a new job once i get a raise my spending habits are going to be different and we're going to do things differently and i'm going to start once i get into job i'll start paying tithes and once i get into job i'll start coming to church and we make these promises why because the fresh start in the new beginning is huge to us in our minds something very big psychologically and because it's big we cut we can enter into this mode of continually searching for that new beginning we're always looking for that clean slate we're trying to figure out a way to start all over again and there's a lot of different examples that i can give where some of us who are maybe obsessive-compulsive there's certain things that we're just not happy to start all over with we just need to trash it dump it forget about it delete it and start all over from scratch because there's a psychology to this the way that we think and because we're wanting this fresh start this new lease on life it can cause a cycle of tomorrow it's going to be different and then things unwinding again and then the search is on and you're longing and it creates this continual cycle of wanting a place to start over again it's a phrase that's used in alexander pope's essay an essay on man he uses the phrase hope springs eternal and it's become this uh proverb within a humanity not a scripture but an observation of man where hope springs eternal that within the nature of man he's always wanting to find fresh cause for optimism i've got a new reason to believe this time i got a new reason to hope hope springs eternal there's something within us that keeps us hoping regardless of the odds regardless of the circumstances everything could be crashing and falling apart and horrible and the decisions be bad and the health be bad but the next day the first day of spring we can say to ourselves you know what from this point on and we can give ourselves fresh cause to be optimistic fresh cause to be positive why because there's something within us where hope springs eternal that there's always a rebirth of our expectation a rebirth of a hope this time it's gonna be different and this longing drives us in every human heart there's a longing for a new beginning in every human heart there's a longing for a fresh start and this fresh start it's a solid place it's a place where you can get your footing and you can spring forward from this is what we think about when we think a new beginning or a fresh start when we talk about hope springs eternal and all these mechanisms in our mind it's a place of solid footing where he's like you know what from here i feel like i can do it from this place right here i feel like i can make a change from this place right here i feel like from this moment on things can be different are we satisfied with the foundation anybody good we can move on let's look at ezra chapter nine as we read this before i'd like to read it again that's my foundation now i would like to dig into the scriptures on this subject and cover hopefully some very relevant ground for you or at least for our neighbors in the apartment next door if they'd be so inclined to stream this ezra chapter 9 verse 5 and at the evening sacrifice this is the type of christ i arose up from my heaviness here's this burden this longing within his heart and having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands and to the lord my god and this is a state of repentance this is a state of reflection and you could tell by what he begins to say next he's saying look at my past look at our past his own culpability there's no excuses he says and i said oh my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee here's your blushing prophet acknowledging trespasses and sins and iniquities it says for our iniquities are increased over our head he's overwhelmed it's overgrown and our trespass has grown up unto the heavens since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil into the confusion of faith as it is this day this is an acknowledgement of very dire circumstances captivity spoil confusion of faith there's consternation there's no no place of rest there's no a place of belonging and then he says in this repentance and this acknowledgement that he i'm not worthy of good i'm not worthy of another opportunity he says and now for a little space grace have been showed from the lord our god there's been a new lease on life i've been we've been given breathing room we didn't deserve it we've been trespassing we've had iniquities that have increased to heaven they've grown over our heads and we've given ourselves over by our own accord to captivity spoil and confusion of face and this chaos but yet somehow some way you've given us breathing room somehow someway we'll be giving we're given an opportunity to start over again we were told that if we just keep your word that we would have this possession forever we didn't keep your word jerusalem was taken away from us so we don't deserve to keep it but now we're getting to go back we're getting to go back to jerusalem now you're giving us another chance from the kings and from those who are oppressors are telling us that we can build the walls again and it's like this is amazing we're beginning we're given a chance a little relief as it says to lighten our eyes that are well sorry to leave us a remnant to escape like we're getting free we're lit we're being let loose and notice this phrase here and to give us a nail in this holy place i'd like to come back to that this would become part of the foundation for the remainder of the service to give us a nail in this holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving because we're given a nail in this holy place there's a lightening of our eyes there's a little revive and a new life new vigor in our bondage for we were bond men yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but have extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving newness of life to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem he's describing something that was unexpected we didn't deserve this who would have ever thought that the walls of jerusalem would be raised again and be built up again this is prophecy we we didn't think of it we didn't hope for it we had asked for this we had deserved it but now here's another opportunity to give us a nail in this holy place and given this now god will lighten our eyes give us a little revive and we'll be able to set up and repair and when he uses the phrase ezra uses this phrase to give us a nail in his holy place this is a pen or a stake we hear about driving a stake down we we use that phrase to refer to i'm driving a stake down it becomes a reference point for you if it's a stake that's being driven down by a um a surveyor then they're marking a boundary they're driving a pin down we say i'm driving down a stake it's a reference point we want to go back later and say that day i made a promise that day i drove down a stake that day i've established a reference point and that's going to be an anchor point driving down a stake when you when you're climbing uh when you're climbing a mountain since i look like a mountain climber i'm just guessing at this i see them drive stakes and i'm assuming that this becomes an anchor point that if they're going to fall or lose their footing it stops there at least that looks like what they're doing they may be doing the exact opposite i don't know i'm not a mountain climber when i'm when i turn 49 i may want to climb mount everest i don't know but they drive down a stake they drive a pin in it's like you know what i feel comfortable because i've been able to establish this mark i've got this position so when he says to give us a nail in this holy place it's a pen or a stake and the word that's used here is associated with the tents that they would establish in the wilderness when the children of israel are in their exodus and especially with the tabernacle when they would set it up when they would fashion it and fasten it down and make sure that it was secure they would use these tent these stakes and these pins and these cords and they would drive them in and then they would be anchored and say this is secure and this is what ezra is referring to is it says in isaiah chapter 22 verse 23 just to see this language that's used about a nail in a hole in his holy place and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house i will set him fasten him as a nail in a sure place this is what ezra's referring to a nail in a sure place there's going to be solid footing there's going to be a an anchoring point this is good ground this is going to stand this is going to be a permanent this is going to withstand the wind this is going to withstand you're not going to be able to just rip this thing up very easily i'm going to set him as a nail in a sure place this is something secure when you have a nail in a sure place you're like well that will that hold i don't know it looks like it and let me try and wait we hang on it right we're gonna see well this hole will this work and when you know that it can hold when you know it'll hang because it's you found the stud you're anchored in something solid this is exactly what it's referring to isaiah chapter 33 verse 20 look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation tabernacle that shall not be taken down this is language being used at the tabernacle very similar to the language that ezra is using a nail in this holy place to give us reviving to set up the house of our god to repair the desolations to give us a wall here jerusalem's going to be a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken this is what he's referring to and he says to give us a nail in this holy place to give us a settlement not tossed and removed from place to place by our masters and by kings and by governments however they wanted us move us here move us there tell us to do this tell us to do that but we have a settlement a place of a fixed place and this is what ezra's desiring he's desiring a fixed settlement in the land of judea he's desiring a permanent location in the temple of the lord where we can drive down a stake we can drive in our pins we can we can set it as a as a nail fastened in a secure place they desired the place of god sanctuary jerusalem a quiet habitation a resting place is the language he's using where they were supported to gain new life a reviving this is how isaiah excuse me ezra is describing his feelings in a moment of despair and heaviness and a blessing prophet sensing an opportunity to erase decades of sins hundreds of years of iniquities that have been accumulated and piling on here's a prophet sensing this is extraordinary we as a people we as a nation are being given a chance by god to start over again this is the language of the prophet that can relate to the psychology that we were referring to a moment ago that causes the nine enders to search their lives and begin to engage in activities to find meaning ezra's using a language that speaks to these needs and desires that we have in our hearts and because we have these desires and even this need it causes us as i said before to always be looking to always be searching and in searching we're trying to find a place to drive a nail we want to feel settled trying to find a place to finally stand up catch our breath from this point on i can do the things that i always wanted to do as ezra said to give us a little reviving ezra's looking for a landmark this temporal landmark a fresh start a place of springing up now doesn't matter what's happened before now grace has been shown now there's been mercy shown to us now's our time this is our moment now we can start all over again this is an opportunity now start to use the language in our minds as we've read this and we've read ezra we could use a language that maybe we use with each other this time it's going to be different now i can start this this is an opportunity to start he's saying we've been released from the bondage of our oppressors released from the bondage of our sins we can be released from all the bondage of our bad habits bad decisions all these different things that can hang on to us and now i feel like i can breathe we've gotten out from underneath that now now there's new hope now hope is spring and eternal this is like springtime this is a chance this is an opportunity i know that there's these things begin to come into my mind how god gives us an opportunity by even refinancing or selling a home and we feel like you know what we can start over again we're not upside down we're we're not we're we're not under this weight anymore we've been we've gotten past that and we thought oh now now's our chance now is our opportunity it feels great when that happens doesn't it at least that's what our neighbors in the apartment next door tell us it's awesome when that happens we've got everything figured out so nirvana is just kind of like the constant state that we live in but let me ask you this since we can be honest since the the neighbors just dropped off the stream let's just be honest with ourselves have you ever been in such a mess that you just wanted to start over it's it's like what we learned with our first nintendo the reset button solves all our problems right that's all we need to do we just need to hit reset that's the problem control alt delete restart it hey let me save the husbands and the teenagers uh 15 minutes tomorrow mom have you restarted your phone right just restart it see if that works because that's what we've learned starting something over again sometimes fixes what's wrong because the process has been running and something's accumulated and memory is being hog and there's no way to dump it and something just keeps building and building and building and the only way to get things back to the way they need to be we don't need to panic and go buy a new macbook pro we don't need to panic and go get the geek squad to figure this thing out have you started with restarting it to start all over again and i'm asking have you ever been in that place where you just wanted to hit reset like if i could only be eight years old again playing super mario bros and just hit reset just start over when you're getting beat and tecmo bowling you and there's no way you can come back and ah just hit reset start over we can feel this way with things that are very important not um our quest to speedrun super mario brothers but in relationships we can get so far behind in relationships and have so much history and mistakes we've made mistakes they've made so much so much of a past in our own relationships to where we feel like we can never catch up how am i gonna make this right or how can i get over that and we can do this in relationships where we feel like i don't i don't see a way out of this i don't see a way for this just to to recover and what we would love to be able to have is that reset button in our relationships with let's just go over here and hit reset and we're starting again from ground zero starting from scratch starting all over again and wouldn't it be nice if you could do that and the and just as the game doesn't remember any of your prior bad moves neither does your spouse right and it's not being held over our head this is what we think about would say well i'm in a mess i wish i could start all over again i don't like the way things have gone what are we looking for an opportunity to start over so we do when we go through it we have a cleanse we detox it or we do something where we're wanting our body to restart and there's a lot of them out there that really don't do anything physiologically to the body but it's all in the head and it's all you need if you could somehow convince yourself that all these pills i'm taking are giving me a fresh start and you're convinced that's all you need to know even if your gut doesn't know the fact that your mind does the placebo effect is real and we shouldn't necessarily belittle it because it produces results when it comes to certain things and this is the psychology this is what's in our minds we want to start all over again we want to be able to catch up we want to cleanse we want to detox we want to declutter we want to minimalize we want to sell we want to get rid of we want to start fresh and clean we want to find a place to start fresh again and i want to zero in on something how the word you turn to john chapter 3. the word gives us a foundational answer the word gives us foundational answers but a foundational answer to man's search for a clean slate man is a creature of thought we have imagination conscience memory reason and affection they're all connected and relate together and there's a way that the each one of these holds a memory each one of these is recording things if you ever disliked something you'll have this it's programmed in you this dislike a bad experience with a particular food can be within your psyche decades later for just the thought of it ah no thank you i had a bad experience at a church potluck uh last week last decade last year whenever it was right like i don't know and it's something that holds in your mind so it's not just memory is not just the one place where but it's it's feelings and sensations and thoughts and emotions and there's a place that god wants to bring us all as individuals and it's the foundational point to begin to satisfy this need that we have as humans and begin to find that there is a place where hope does spring eternal in john chapter 3 we'll go ahead and just read verses 1 to 9. there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him and i think it's this is me personally it's a peculiar answer to his statement but it's so it's so profound and introductory to us verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god is he answering to the fact that nicodemus is reasoning with this and i know you're a teacher and if you're doing these things this must be god who's doing and he said is he saying well unless you're born again you're really not going to know what's taking place and what's happening but his statement except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god it catches nicodemus off guard and nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old because to be born is a new beginning it's a fresh start it's newness it's infancy it's it's it's innocence and of something fresh can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i said to thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh so now we see a difference between flesh and spirit and that which is born of the spirit of spirit you can be have a first birth which is what nicodemus is relating to things through but jesus is saying there's got to be a second birth nicodemus uses the language can he enter into his mother's womb and be born a second time but jesus is talking about a second birth a very real literal second birth but it's one in which you're born of the spirit marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hears the sound thereof but can't tell not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit so nicodemus trying to figure these things out with his question jesus answer he exclaims out loud in verse 9 how can these things be nicodemus is perplexed by the phrase that christ uses or in the way that christ uses it except a man be born again and i say it that way he was perplexed with the context that jesus is using he's perplexed with the way that jesus is using the phrase that a man must be born again because the jews believe that a convert to their religion a convert to judaism was like a child born anew they used that phrase of a proselyte when they were converted to the the law converted to judaism they said this man is like a man that is born anew but to them they recognize this as being a civil birth that they were born into the certain privileges that a natural jew had and that a jew who was born of it by blood would enjoy so they would say you're starting over again within judaism but jesus the language he uses even catches this jew off guard and he's like wait a minute i don't know how these things can be i i can understand that when someone converts to our religion and converts to believing the one true god that we're like hey you're like starting all over again you're a child being born anew but jesus is pointing to a birth from above that changes a person's nature because he says hey who's born of the flesh is flesh if you're a jew convert or a heathen converting to judaism you're still flash but i'm talking about someone being born a second time from above not being like a child born a new but someone who is born he's using a language that speaks of a life beginning anew beginning a and i believe it's scofield that uses this language beginning a fundamental impermanent revolution it's the beginning of a fundamental and permanent revolution within the believer's heart where this is something that's ongoing i've been born again just as much as a natural birth sets you within a process that in natural things culminates not only in physical maturity and emotional maturity but ultimately results in the in the grave jesus is saying there is a birth that results in a fundamental and permanent revolution that for the believer does not result in death but a translation it is if i could say this for the elect our spring it's our spring in a lifetime that has one spring and will never have a winter it's when new life is born where we can talk about newness and freshness there's a reviving this is an experience where every single one of us will know a second chance a real one too to be born again is not the reformation of our person it is not moving from new york to los angeles it is not buying a new house it is not changing your diet from veganism to all meat it's not this is not the reformation of a person this is a creative act of god this is a supernatural regeneration this is something taken deep within a person's spirit in a supernatural level romans chapter 6 verse 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin now this is again just as ezra used it and i'm wanting to call us back to this he's touching on this human psychology by saying that was the old guy that was the old me i didn't know you did that oh yeah i i i i stopped doing whatever last year or there was a point when ever since i turned 40 i run marathons or ever since i did this this happens and we can actually take every bad habit every every pound and every mistake and every every dollar lost and every credit card uh um that we've maxed out and every car repossessed and every house foreclosed we could pin it on the old guy right don't we do that we do that and this is exactly what um paul is referring to now in a very real literal fundamental sense that we all long for like oh well how come you're bringing that up i mean i did that six years ago well you gotta wait seven years before that drops off oh okay well i guess we'll wait another year honey it's on your record somewhere you want to get free from it well now paul is saying that this old man it literally means your old self your past person is dead it's been crucified with christ it's establishing a supernatural reality to what we actually try to create with our temporal landmarks yesterday was the first day of spring now things are going to be different this is the supernatural reality this is the real deal to all of our new year's resolutions our temporal landmarks the opportunity to start over again a new job the new house finally getting married all these things what is it we say with respect to with respect to new year's resolutions all my failures from the past were the old guy hey man i buried that out in 2020 that you can't hold that against me anymore that was that's the old man that's the old one somebody said to me i said the other day that um when i say last year i'm referring to 2019. that makes a lot of sense last year doesn't count so not only is the old man dead he didn't even do anything in 2020 it doesn't count we have this idea that this is that's the old guy the new me is different don't hold that against me yeah yeah yeah i know you're all nervous about inviting me over for a party but that was the old me i'm different now i've changed don't worry but i i'm more reserved i'm more careful i can do this i can do that and this is what we do we actually in the natural not religious not super spiritual not christians not jews or or um or christians but we establish this line of uh where i've drawn the line from this moment forward this is the new me and you can't hold all those things about the old guy against me because i've started over i've got a new outlook on life i've got a new beginning so this is literally god has given us this opportunity through a new birth and really when you think about this idea that well when i say last year i'm referring to 2019 this is our attempt to disconnect ourselves from our past mistakes it's our attempt to say you know what that doesn't count i've got a clean slate in order to do what boost our efforts to start over again that's like well if you're gonna if if that's still the case then i might as well right well if you're gonna hold that over my head i might as well be guilty of it or if you're gonna do that i might as well do this and what if it's gonna still be laid against us if it's still gonna be on our record if it's still going to be at our charge then i might as well continue to keep doing what i was doing as a result of it does that make sense i have the picture in my mind and i'm doing a poor job of explaining it to you but it's it's this idea that i can somehow disassociate from my past that kind of gives us this thought you know what i can do this this is a new opportunity this is a fresh start and it's what gives us it boosts our efforts to spring forward and to begin something again and th this what we're looking at in john chapter 3 is the scripture way to do it without the result of an accumulation of a bunch of disappointments how many fresh starts have we had how many new beginnings how many second chances how many times have we said this time it's different and there's a way that this begins to wear on us it's of no fault other than our own but not to the in the sense that we ought to condemn ourselves it's like this is just human nature what did you expect we're always going to be hope springs eternal this time it's going to be different this time it's going to be new this time i'm going to see it through this time i'm going to make better decisions and this time i promise honey it's going to be different this time i promise i'm going to get i'm going to do my job right this time i'm going to do it this time i'm going to do it and we feel like i've got a chance i got a chance i have this landmark it's going to be different and somehow just through the war of attrition we go right back into the same thing again but what jesus is pointing out is a scriptural way to have a second chance a fresh start without the accumulation of all the disappointments why because we can actually say the old man is dead he's not even around anymore romans chapter 6 verse 4 as it just proceeded this old man is crucified therefore we are buried with him by baptism and to death that like as christ was raised up sprung up resurrection springtime raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life he want god wants you this is something god wants you to experience he wants you to experience a fresh start and the scripture is constantly sharing this with you and i believe we've we must understand this if you have been born again and you become uh baptized by the spirit into the body of christ then god wants you to have to know that that was a fresh start and if it's not your own attempts let it be known that any man's attempt to bring something up from your past to bear upon your present and to think that it'll alter your future outside the context of this new birth that's tethered me to eternity you have a right to say no that man is dead or woman you have a right to say no it's been buried it's over and accept the fact that you have power to resurrect an old nature and in doing so by language and conduct that's the only way your past can have power over you if you use your ability to resurrect it and stand firm on this position to say no it's dead it's buried i won't let my fears my anxieties and my weaknesses and my suspicions resurrect an old nature that the word has told me is dead and buried with christ and don't let somebody else bring up a ghost of your past hold it over your head counting the times you've moved count the times you've made mistakes and so how many times is this you're going to try to come to church again don't let them do it it's a place where you can start fresh a new beginning something unprecedented in other words all our efforts that where we end up back at the same place again this time this is something new because you don't write you don't come back to where you started again you've started it was it was brother lucas who had the never-ending beginning was their wedding url or something like that many many years ago is the website still up no but the marriage is that's good right it's something that starts it's not going to end don't worry about this this is just when we look back on this it'll be just a little mist a little vapor something's just begun it's unprecedented there's nothing in your life right now when you were born again and if you're forgetting about what this meant when you were born again this is the purpose of it is kind of remove the cobwebs and dust things off and remove all the confusion say look when you were born again there's no metric there's nothing from the past there's no personal paradigm that you can go back and have a reference point to try to figure out what's happened this is unprecedented we can use things like well it's like when a baby's born and well it's like this happening but really it's never happened before for you soul is made new he's using a language he says to walk in newness of life he's using a language that should connect with our longing to start over is he using a language that's that's rooted deep within our psychology can i start over can i have a fresh start well i won't be able to i can't start unless i'm given a chance i have to have a point to begin and we look for it well why don't you do it now well i'm waiting for this i'm waiting for something to happen and it gives us that boost that we need the psychological edge that we can do it ephesians chapter 4 verses 22 to 24 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust you can put him off because he's dead put them off this is the new behavior that you've engaged in which is after god is created which after god is created in well let me i think i just skipped here that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man this is the putting on of the new man it's not necessarily a one-time uh change of robe but it's an opportunity for constant renewal we're putting off the old man we're putting on the new man this is daily renewal daily dying daily reviving which is corrupt according to the deceitfulness be renewed in the spirit of mind put on the new man which is after god is created in righteousness and true holiness a new man is this not the language we use on january 1st i'm a new man this is the language we use when we turn 50. this is the language that we use when this landmark this temporal landmark i'm a new woman this is a chip fresh it's spring yesterday was the first day of spring i'm going to be different this time and this is exactly what paul is saying you get when you're born again as it says in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature i know we it said with such repetition and often with such force that it might have a way of just getting dull by the time it gets to our hearts but this is powerful if any man be in christ by one spirit we're baptized into christ by being born again by the spirit of god and being sealed into his body we are a new creation new creatures in christ all things are passed away like winter being gone everything's in the past it no longer is present we don't have to worry about winter the chill the snow the darkness old things are passed away behold all things are become new this is a language to say now everything changes if you've had a habit that you it can change if you've had a history it can change if you've had a potential propensity to do something now it can change now it doesn't mean everything has changed but he wants you to be in the frame of mind to believe that it can change that we say well i got born again but this still happens and that still happens that's because you haven't fully yielded to this like the reality that everything's different now and we give in to some of these familiar feelings something starts coming around oh i know what's happening okay well i guess i just might as well do it instead of realizing wait a minute the mechanisms are different this time yes it's the same old familiar feeling but now i realize i'm not the same person you don't have that power over me i don't have to answer to that i don't have to respond to that this is not my lot in life this is not my temptation this is not my weakness my family history has been broken my my addictions have been broken my bad habits have been broken how right now suddenly i believe that i'm as being a new creature in christ jesus all things have become new well you're still walking kind of in that old stuff well with each step it becomes new with each step it's becoming new all things are becoming new and that's the mindset i want to have that's the belief in the faith that i want to have things are becoming new c.s lewis when he was uh now i'm forgetting what the name of the um i think it's a sudden the suddenness of joy actually i think is the name of his kind of his autobiography he writes about his uh his life and his path in life he ends this book and he's an incredible writer and this book is just filled with so many different references it's incredible work but he comes to the conclusion of his book and he says but what in conclusion of joy because that was the name of the title of the book some say it was inspired by a wadsworth a wordsworth poem called the suddenness of joy so at the very end he comes back to that he goes what about joy then isn't that what we all want joy happiness you know i said well i just hope you're happy right now what we say to people when we disagree with what they're doing and uh and so we just try to pin it on the fact that they're just always disgruntled they're never happy well i sure hope you're happy how's that working out for you happy and and so that because that kind of becomes the end all right happiness and joy and we really think of it in terms of a personal satisfaction not even a supernatural spiritual saturday but i just want to feel fulfilled i want to be happy and the truth is as the book is written you truly just stumble on happiness what you think is going to make you happy doesn't really make you happy so this right here to me is so profound what about joy what's the conclusion for that after all is what the story has mainly been about to tell you the truth the subject has nearly lost all interest for me since i became a christian but the subject of finding happiness and finding joy and getting pleasure and being fulfilled yeah you know since i became a christian just doesn't mean what it used to to me before right everything's changed all things have become new yeah some of all the old things are still around but it's new to me because i'm looking at it different the pursuit of joy the pursuit of happiness the pursuit of this perfection this and all these things they're all around us they're still there but you know what i'm a new man now and though the old things are there all things have become new to me and it doesn't mean to me like what it used to mean he says i cannot indeed complain like wordsworth that the visionary gleam is passed away he wrote the poem about the passing of his daughter and how that there was a moment the suddenness of joy this is a man who lost his heart he has this suddenness of joy and he wants to share with his daughter only to realize she's gone and so it's a it's a it's an interesting poem and this is what c.s lewis is referring to i mean i hope that maybe those of you who like the chronicles of narnia have you know given me some credibility by reading quoting c.s lewis but it is profound i want you to stay with this if you can i can't complain like this poet that the visionary gleam has passed away i believe if the thing were at all worth recording that the old stab the old bittersweet has come to me as often and as sharply since my conversion as at any time of my life whatever the pain of loss the disappointment the sorrow i have been visited by the stab he says the bittersweet i felt it and you know what i may have felt it more now as a christian than i did before i was a christian now that seems like it would be fodder for the critic but notice what he says but i now know that that experience i now know that experience considered as a state of mind had never had the kind of importance i once gave it oh isn't that wonderful sorry for getting excited about c.s lewis but he says i now know that that state of mind those emotions and those feelings never ever were as important as i thought they should be why because i'm a new creature now i i've been born again i i feel new i feel fresh and everything it's all still there but it doesn't mean the same thing to me anymore it was valuable only as a pointer to something other and outer while the other was in doubt the pointer naturally loomed larger in my thoughts it was only a pointer that there was a place of rest a place of happiness a place of healing a place of joy in jesus christ all those pains and all those disappointments were only a pointer to the one who can satisfy and he says while that one was in doubt why i did not know him the pointer loomed much bigger in my life but now that i have him the pointer can't hurt me like it could before and then he uses this phrase i wanted to expound upon this in a different way when we are lost in the woods the sight of a signpost is a great matter when you're lost and you first see the sign are we on the right path i don't know i haven't seen a sign i don't know should we turn around what should we do and then you see it then the sign tells you how many miles away it is and what the exit is you're like oh oh that was good that's great always saw it we know we're on the right path he says look it's a great matter he who first sees it christ look the whole party gathers around and stares but when we have found the road and are passing signposts every few miles we shall not stop and stare when you're lost when you find it you stop and you look at oh oh my look at this this is it he says but then once you found the road and you see the signpost you don't stop and stare they will encourage us and we shall be grateful to the authority that has set them up but we shall not stop and stare or not much not on this road though their pillars are of silver and their lettering of gold we would be at jerusalem and then he gives the last decl disclaimer before he ends his autobiography goes not that i haven't stopped a little bit too much along the way but let this part be the point that he's trying to make that when you're in the world and you have not been born again the pointers seem much bigger than they do when you're born again and when you're in the world there's things that seem so large and so important but when you're born again all things become new when we behold a signpost when we're lost we stop we rejoice we settle for a moment we found it we found it but once we get in the path we have one goal in mind and one vision we say yep thanks for the sign pulse i'm on the right path but he said i will not stop i will not be deterred not stop and stare because on this road i must be at jerusalem i must make it i cannot stop why i've been born again i have a vision i have a purpose i have a goal i will not stop until i see it all things have become new he's quoting from some of your favorite some of you your favorite author walter hilton in the latter the scale of perfection i said that jokingly probably none of you ever heard of him before no this is not the hilton that owns this building but walter hilton said what so thou hearest or see us or fearless that should let thee in the way abide not with it willfully tarry not for it restfully behold it not like and not dread it not but i go forth in thy way and think that thou would just be at jerusalem once you've been born again the path is different that doesn't mean we don't have familiar experiences it doesn't mean we don't go through things that we went through before it's a reminder now that you're now on a path where things can be different you don't have to take the same exits you did before you don't have to stop and stare you don't have to continually revisit oh well is this the time for me to be re-baptized again listen if you've been born again and sealed with the the holy ghost there is no need to go back to the water zero none absolutely none the seal of god is what you want if you have it walk in it don't be bullied and intimidated to get wet again believe in the promise it only weakens your experience when through dread and fear and apprehension you're drawn to be re-baptized if you've got the seal of god and you know it then it worked right it worked it happened all things have become new i say let this be your basis for another fresh start let this be all of us for all of us our bases you say well brother and i've been born again well then this is we're looking at this today saying you know what this is i want to have a different attitude and mindset a fresh start in my faith towards the promises of god a new outlook on what this new birth experience means to me let this become the foundation that you're looking back to that god did in your life where i have been given a renewal and a reminder that we must be at jerusalem i've got a place that i'm going i've got a path that i'm headed in we must be at jerusalem i was thinking about this last week i believe it was and says you know what's wrong with the perfectionist the perfectionist that's what makes a perfectionist imperfect is the perfectionist himself and and i thought about it this way in terms of all of our starts and restarts and second chances the problem with all of them and all of our clean slates it's the same person with the same promise and they say that the uh the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result i don't know why i keep getting headaches well what are you doing i'm banging my head up against this wall and the headaches won't go away like well um if you don't want headaches i don't know i'm just guessing here i wouldn't bang your head up against the wall but what's it saying i'm keep doing it and i keep getting headaches there's a problem when it's just us doing it problem when it's just us making the promise using we've used the example or made reference to a move and said well we're moving we're going to move into a new house we're moving to a new state we're starting all over again but you bring all the same stuff with you it's like it's all the same stuff it's all the same problems all the same clutter all this they got the same job we got the same spending habits i got the same health everything's still the same you just drag along all the same problems oh what if we could if we're going to get somewhere we're going to do this listen if i can say this to you as a church don't think that we're any less of a church or can have any less dynamic services in the power of god move just because we're in a temporal building because if we if we kind of say well you know it's okay but it once we find a church once we get an actual building the potential is there to actually have church well i'm not waiting for a new building to have church as far as i'm concerned the have church has really been co-opted by a lot of charisma and care and fleshly workup i want the word to have preeminence and he could do that in here and so if we could if we built it up in our minds that well once we get a new building then things will be different it won't be so i said now is the day of salvation now is the time now is what we're we feel that god has given us an opportunity god is on the scene god is doing things and so we could change church locations but we're going to bring all the same things with this and it's going to be there at the new one david clarkson he was a puritan minister considered one of the rejected or ejected ministers of the puritan movement ejected out of the church of england in the 1600s he takes the scripture therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature he says let old things pass away let all things become new you who brought this world out of nothing with the word can with the word work in me this new creation you who brought the world into being with your voice can do the same thing in me and all my chaos and all my disorder all suffer me not to perish when you can so easily make me happy amen suffer me not to be void suffer me not to be despondent when you can so easily make me happy speak the word and it will be done just speak the word in this soul now dark woeful chaos and a lump of corruption and confusion would become a new creature just speak the word that's the attitude we ought to have every day of our lives just let the word come on the scene let the word be spoken over let the word have preeminence and this soul this woeful chaos this lump of corruption and confusion will become a new creature brother brown says in the message absolute and what christians need today in this atomic age in this time of uncertainty you need something be something besides just an experience of joining church something more than just changing locations and changing the address something more than just joining church you need an anchor an absolute that you know because churches will fail and people will fail but christ cannot fail he he's the absolute to the believer and if christ is your absolute you're tied to him and if he's your absolute and you're tied to him then you are tied to the word that's right if any man be in christ he is a new creature oh then let him just speak the word it's talking about a new beginning a fresh foundation this is what a christian needs everyone says every christian doesn't just need to join church and in joining church let's go ahead and do all the things we think we know we should do in church and now things are going to be different we just we need a foundation a starting place we read it in isaiah chapter 43 verses 18 and 19 i'll read it again remember you not the former things neither consider the things of old in the context that god it's being used here because it actually says elsewhere in isaiah remember you the former things of all so here he's saying remember it not in this context based upon what god is saying he's saying what i am going to do is so great that you'll forget what i have done remember you're not the former things neither consider things of old don't put me in a box don't try to minimize what i can do don't use what's happened in the past as their basis for expectation i will do a new thing based upon what i have done based upon what i will do what i have done before should not serve as your ceiling should not serve for what you're looking for i'm going to be doing something great and different and so it indicates that verse 19 is referring to something unprecedented unlike any other experience behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it i will do a new thing it's something that he does suddenly now it springs forth it's a new beginning it's a fresh start i will supernaturally bring newness of life i will bring growth as a way in the wilderness i will bring water as streams in the desert and rivers in the desert i can bring deliverance from self i can bring deliverance from the bondage of habits which you've carried along year after year and used in self-destructive cycles i'm gonna do a new thing don't look back in your life of well i tried and it did work i tried and i did work i tried this and i didn't don't look back anymore in fear of what has been behold i do a new thing all your bad habits all your self-destructive tendencies i can change in a moment i can release you from the despair of things just never really able to work out things just don't ever work out like i wanted them to i can't seem to figure it out what happens when this oh fresh start new beginning this time it's going to be different what ends up happening you stop trying can i get an amen you stop trying to get paralyzed the fear gets so great you know you know i'd only want to try next time used to try to work it out with my spouse but now i don't even try anymore you used to want to do this but now i don't i just give up i just quit you become paralyzed why because our lives get littered with so many starts and stops so many failures so many lost hopes so many broken dreams that it's built a complex that you're afraid to fail or a big wall that says not can't do it has it just gotten too real i know it means something to somebody so now it's 11 47 if that means anything to anyone if you need to pull out your crockpot app and take it down the temperature down a little bit you tell your traeger to go ahead and just warm that now might be the time to do it because i've got to get to this point i've been building to this in psalms chapter 55. just think about these this despair that things just don't work out like i want them to and because they don't i'm i'm just even afraid to try this is what the psalmist is describing describing a person whose nerves are so fragile they're unable to hope unable to even believe for a fresh start they're just you know what this is just the way it's going to be fearless and trembling are come upon me and hath overwhelmed me enveloped me i've become feeble i've grown weak i've been rendered unable yet i'm longing for rest because he says and i said oh that i had wings like a dove think about how you can put yourself in this person's position i'm anxious i'm bound i have complexes i'm fearful i'm trembling i'm overwhelmed my belly cleaves to the earth as it were because my soul is so broken and i'm so dried up there's no life in me there's no vitality and all you have is the ability to say i just wish i could fly away from here just wish i could get away somehow then i would fly away and be at rest i'd get out of this situation and get out of this condition and the psalmist is describing someone who's just so warned and so tired and so weary they can only just hope that they could be a bird to fly away to a place of rest it's this nastiness and this viciousness of a need and a desire in our hearts to begin again to have a fresh start to accomplish something to be successful and to constantly be met by bitter failure through our own human efforts and not find that place of rest in christ through new birth experience or forget that we are resting in that i had a dozen statements i wanted to read to you from brother brown i'm in prayer line excuse me i narrowed it down to four i believe and i i hope this is some something heavy hitting for you can we all just purpose in our hearts right now there's no doubt there's no fear there's no we we want to believe for somebody i i would encourage you to believe for yourself what you believe yourself but if you can't if you feel that well this the direction he's going this is for this person this is for that person let's believe for the neighbors next door let's believe right now let's have faith to believe that god god's speaking to someone's heart who needs this who wants to hear from god billy bradham and the message be certain of god we may have read this uh last year at one point and when i say last year he says he's in a prayer line and a young man comes and says young man you are nervous and upset don't you know that god can heal nerves and in a dozen different statements that i that i had put in my notes to use brother branham identifies stomach problems and ulcers and peptic conditions and bodily functions being impaired he says it's just nervousness it's just nerves you just keep getting worked out and science will tell you doctors will tell you when they're trying to diagnose whether what something's wrong in your your gastrointestinal system and say are you nervous are you going through difficulty there's a problem is there something because why because the body can respond in that way you get you um people when they get under pressure and they're a difficult situation they can just get heartburn they say why do you have to eat some spicy you know i'm just nervous and brother adam says this he says do you know that god can heal nerves well we know we can heal a belly but he can heal a belly only for it to get nervous again so he said you know god can heal nerves it's hard for a nervous person to get a hold of it brother says the hardest thing in the world you've been wanting a place to place your foot you've been wanting to find a nail some solid footing you're a great thinker crossing bridges before you get to it and taking other things don't do it no more you don't feel bad now see it's off you now if you'll go believing it'll never come on you again in the name of jesus christ believe it what was the what was it the problem with this egg he's a deep thinker already running through the progressions already working out the scenarios always a few steps ahead well if i do this then this should happen that should happen well then this is going to happen this is going to happen and so they just work it all out in their minds and what happens when the bridge isn't there when you get there you're already on the other side you're marooned on an island emotionally you're stranded and you get nervous how do i get to myself i'm over there i've already done this i've already this has already happened i don't know what to do and it causes this turmoil and says you're a nervous person he says you just want a solid place to stand you want a fresh start he says in another sermon to a sister in a prayer line awful nervous aren't you lady that's the devil that makes you that way you think there's many things wrong but nervousness is what the main thing is that makes you feel like everything's wrong like a black bolt comes from you like a cloud or something that wave that's waves like a breathe breath moving you get scared many times in the evening times when the sun is sinking low you get real weary don't you is that right many times you think you're going to lose your mind but you're not you'll last fear not you're going to be all right do you believe me to be a servant right now listen if this is right you've often prayed and wanted a place to where you could think you could set your foot to start from this is the temporal landmarks well i'm changing this i'm doing that i'm starting this all these regimes all these different things you do you're looking for a fresh place to start put your foot on say this time it's gonna be different he says isn't that right and i love this all right this is your footstep this is your footstep not waiting till tomorrow not waiting till uh the first day of the month we're not waiting to this point that point a new visit a new plan a new strategy no this is your footstep go now and be healed in the name of the lord jesus christ and be made well amen have faith in god you think your life is a mess and you've got all these problems all these physical needs your main thing is nervousness and that makes you think everything else is wrong it comes like a black bolt like something breathing pressing you moving in on you he says you've prayed and wanted a place where you could set your foot on and start from you just wanted a fresh start you just wanted a place to start anew he says this is your footstep this is your place he says and be healed go now and be healed in jeremiah chapter 33 verse 6 behold he said behold i will do a new thing jeremiah says it in the language which is so beautiful i will bring it health which is restoration of soundness it's a it's a it's a mind that's on solid ground it's the restoration of health your mind is going to be steady and cure which means to heal or to mend wounds i will bring health and cure i and i will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth that's what i want lord take whatever's unhealthy make it healthy take whatever is sick and cure it and reveal unto me the abundance of peace and truth give this to me lord i will bring health and cure i will cure them and reveal to them again in the prayer line brother branham the sermon all the days of our life he says come here sister what's the matter you're all nervous mental nervous you just feel like you can't get to yourself you want a place to place your foot this is it right now at the cross i can make it leave you but it'll come back now listen to what he says here you've got this problem you're nervous and mental nervousness i can make it leave you but it'll come back it's because in this presence now he couldn't stay here if you had to the nervousness but it'll come back if the good man of the house's faith isn't there so he brings it down to this you wanted a place to start now start from right here you wanted a place to start he says you've been wanting a place to place your foot you're a great thinker crossing bridges before you get to them and you take the other things don't do it anymore you've often prayed you wanted a place to start where you could set your foot to start from this is your footstep you wanted a place to start now start from right here lord in the name of jesus christ this shadow of darkness like a mist hanging at that woman in the name of jesus christ demon of nervousness nervousness leave the woman a now amen now go and rejoice look be happy just rejoice and thank god it'll stay away from you just believe it not that the old stab and the old bittersweet won't visit you often but it won't mean as much as it did before it won't be as of great importance as it was before it won't be this fear in this foreboding oh it could be this what it could be that then it gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse when you say starting right now i've placed my foot upon the shore immediately i'm at the bank where i was going and from this moment on i'm walking on solid ground i will no longer be tossed about in the tempest of these storms that are raging about me now i believe now i believe now is my footsteps he says oh i can make it go away from you right now but it'll come back unless you've found that place where your faith can rest we're not just in the in the mode of driving things away so that these come right back but driving them away to the point where you can make your step the preaching of the lord every time the word is preached is an opportunity for a fresh start somewhere somehow in your life it's an opportunity to say be it unto me according that word i take it that's for me i'm going forward for it says in galatians chapter 6 verse 15 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything that would be to be strong in body to be robust to be in sound health circumcision nor uncircumcision causes strong health i can make him leave you we could cast him away we could do some work in the move of the spirit that can do something within your body or within your mind but he's saying what you really need is a new creature in christ jesus what avails what makes a difference what gives health and soundness of mind is a new creature we need god to do a new thing whether it be healing salvation deliverance whether it be restoration on some level even in terms of relationships that just aren't where they need to be he god can bring you to a place to start anew he could bring you to a place to start fresh brother brandon talking about repentance he says repent means to turn around and go back you miss the mark start over again he said what is it going to take by there to start over just say i'm sorry just say just ask for forgiveness to repent he says repent turn around go back you miss the mark i'm sorry you start over again it's a place to start fresh this may have been the one that i referred to earlier that i might have read before but brother branham again with in a prayer line a young man standing before him says nervousness is an awful thing hurts causes all kinds of troubles and everything but god can heal nervousness says you believe that you're a deep thinker son you're one of these types of people that's crossing bridges before you get to them taking other things it never happens the way you think it out anyhow you've always wanted a place to set your foot so you could start you've long defined that place that's right can any of us relate to what this man would be going through everything i've tried everything i've done every moment where i thought would get better and if i just did this this would happen if i just got married this would happen if i just moved this would happen if i just did this this would happen all oh if i could just change professions all these things that we start figuring out in our mind oh this this this this this it'll just get better and brother bam is discerning this within his heart he says you've always wanted it you've always longed for it and you're such a deep thinker you've thought through everything you've analyzed you processed your mind would ever let you rest and it's caused so many troubles in your life because you're always crossing bridges you're always making assumptions you're always letting your negative emotions get ahead of you and just drag you around it must have been an awful life and he says you just want a place where you can get up you want a place as ezra said you gave us some breathing room i feel like i can breathe i feel like i've been born again i feel like this is new i i feel like this is an opportunity i just want a place i can set my foot i've longed to find that place he says you're on that ground right now son you're right at that place right now he says you never want to come up to manhood a neurotic and weary and upside down you're too nice of a young man to do that the shadow now hung over you a few moments ago has left you i don't know what's happened but it's gone from you your faith is taking it away now you're free from your trouble now i want to say to all of us today you're on that ground now right now you're on that ground a place to start fresh that's what this if it's even this service it's what i want to mean to every single one of you that today if it has to be something within our minds to drive away clouds and to drive away doubt to drive away fear today i'm driving down a stake today i'm putting a pin in my experience i'm anchoring today today lord you do a new thing musicians as you would come as it says in isaiah we've read it behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth the first day of spring yesterday in the natural according to the calendar thus in our nine enders and all these different things we could look at in the natural but now for me in my heart today i'm on this ground i've always wanted to find a place where i could get place my foot a solid place a place where if you're going to make a leap you're going to jump if you're going to do something you want to steady yourself you want to make sure that what you're up against is solid will this support me will it hold my weight is this secure is this a point of departure where i could jump from is this trustworthy can i do this this is what someone's wanting i just want to dive right in i want to jump i i want to go and he's saying you're on that ground now come i'll catch you you found the foot and you found the place i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth and i love you says will you not know it will you not know can you not know should you not know i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert shall you not know it will be such a transformation that you will know [Music] let this be the place this is your footstep start from right here you're on that ground now let today be a day that you found a place for a fresh start let this church be a place where someone else can have a fresh start a place where the lord is doing a new thing a place for new beginnings where we could have the kind of spirit in the kind of nature that we see somebody come in to visit church and we're not quick to go oh i better let brother aaron know about them so he knows all their history and what they've done and this and that and the other how about we just take a step back and say lord this time this is their footstep amen they're never going to be the same again and just start expecting it i don't even know this person i don't even know who they are why because they're going to be different word is going to transform them the power of god is going to move it's not going to be the same pretense and politics it's not the same church experience i found a place to start over and i believe they can too can that be the what we the the nature that we have and the nurture that we give [Music] everybody is seated right now but i'm going to ask you to stand and when you do it's a place to start fresh let's stand a place to set your foot to begin again [Music] with heads bowed the lord dealt with my heart very heavily about nerves and nervousness [Music] how problematic it gets [Music] you have to be careful to not become over simplistic when it comes to nerves and nervousness and emotional issues and depression and anxiety and fear so i don't say this in any way to try to sum it all up but to be nervous and to your nerves to be bothering you it's that way because there's no clear explanation it's that way because things often don't make sense if you had a problem and you went to the doctor and they ran a test said oh it's easy you're allergic to oxygen then you would just leave at least knowing well that's my problem i'm allergic to oxygen and we know how to go about it but it's when things don't match up things aren't making sense things are going wrong and i've tried this and i've tried that and why do we always find ourselves in the same situation again and all this anxiety and fear and oppression and nervousness begins to build and we get these complexes god was dealing with me so much on that [Music] and i thought about that a person our neighbors in the apartment next to us who suffer from depression because they're so depressed they don't do laundry they don't do the dishes they don't take care of themselves they don't wash their hair and their lives just get cluttered and messy and they fall so far behind in responsibilities things that they should do and all of a sudden one day they wake up and they make their bed they clean their room and next thing you know they're proud of themselves because they look back at the end of the day and they're like i cleaned my house i did laundry i washed the dishes look look everything's neat everything's clean look i hadn't done it in months i hadn't done it weeks but look what was that they felt something a fresh start if we could relate to that in a natural if we could relate to that to people who struggle with that in natural life i'm wanting you to know that there's a place that you could stand as a believer that you can have a confidence and assurance that from this day forward life is different just as c.s lewis could say you know what about joy well i find out now it didn't mean as much to me as it did when i was in the world and i can't complain like the other poets do but i know that all those experiences in the past were pointing me to this blessed state and experience that i have now that those things never quite had the importance that i once gave it they were only pointing to the dissolver of doubts the resolver of all situations the comforter the god that could give me newness of life and what i have found now i am on a road that i cannot stop and stare i'm on a road where i do not have time to to worry i'm on a road where i don't have time to build bridges i just trust them when i come to him because i must be in jerusalem and say today lord i'm driving down a stake today i'm putting another anchor in the side of this mountain i must be at jerusalem today i'm starting with the fresh seal and the renewing and refilling our heavenly father i pray for these saints these longing souls these young married couples these new families these battle-worn veterans [Music] these physically weary soldiers of the cross the mentally worn believers i pray today that you give them as you did ezra that moment where he felt like he could breathe again it felt like the decades and generations of sin had somehow been swept aside and now god was saying i'm doing something new and he could breathe again and though he was a blessing prophet and he was honest and he's repenting it's what gave him this real sense of renewal now lord you can give us a nail a nail in your holy place and i pray that for all those who are present now that you could give them a nail in your holy place give them a solid footing an anchor lord they would never fear worry again trusting to that unseen hand i pray lord that we can leave from here feeling sensing knowing and believing i found that footstep [Music] i've searched i've searched i've longed i've longed i've wanted i've wanted today i found it that place put my foot and i put both feet on it i'm not afraid i'm not just testing and one foot in the boat and one foot on the water i'm all in lord i'm jumping in lord i'm just diving into this lord with everything that's in me because i'm new i'm born again i feel free i feel delivered and this time i'm trusting to you not myself lord the perfectionist in me has kept me imperfect my entire life my obsessions my compulsions have kept me from accomplishments that now today lord i come to you and i feel that i have been lifted up by a dove who's carrying me to a place of rest heart is overwhelmed you've led me to a rock that is higher than i bless your people i pray in jesus name amen
