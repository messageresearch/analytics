[0:00] I'd like to read um very quickly through
[0:02] a few statements that we referred to on
[0:05] Wednesday night we might have even
[0:06] referenced it last Sunday but I've been
[0:09] personally studying um the shreport
[0:11] series that brother Brandon preached in
[0:13] November of 1965 beginning with
[0:15] Thanksgiving day I believe on Thursday
[0:18] then a Friday night service a Saturday
[0:19] morning a Full Gospel businessman's
[0:21] breakfast uh Saturday evening then
[0:23] services on Sunday and very remarkable
[0:27] um statements and uh very remarkable
[0:30] Series where I feel that if you're going
[0:32] to draw from the first service which was
[0:34] the invisible Union it would be good to
[0:37] listen to the whole thing because
[0:38] brother Ram's just connecting them all
[0:40] together and presenting a very beautiful
[0:43] thought to his audience which was
[0:44] brother Jack Moore one that had helped
[0:46] him quite a bit in his ministry had
[0:48] worked together as his campaign manager
[0:50] was with him in Finland when God had did
[0:52] many wonderful works and was a uh worked
[0:55] with brother Gordon Lindsay started
[0:57] voice of healing or part of that in
[0:59] Herald of his coming and he was a very
[1:02] large figure within the Pentecostal
[1:04] movement and brother brandham beginning
[1:07] in the late 50s and especially in the
[1:08] early 60s as I've gone back and started
[1:11] noticing that some of the most
[1:12] outstanding sermons to me as I was
[1:14] growing up in the Lord uh were the way
[1:17] back and just once more and some of
[1:18] these real Cornerstone sermons that he's
[1:20] preaching to Le oysa that he's preaching
[1:23] to a Pentecostal church that represents
[1:27] what Pentecost had become in an
[1:29] unfortunate way a and how that there was
[1:32] a need for another move of God to break
[1:35] this cycle of Revival and death and it's
[1:38] in the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:39] Christ that he is talking about the
[1:41] Modern Woman not wanting children and
[1:44] brother Branham later on that weekend
[1:46] says the modern church is the
[1:47] Pentecostal church so he's not he's not
[1:50] just calling out Catholics and the
[1:52] formal side he's calling out the whole
[1:53] thing and he says neither does the
[1:55] modern Church want any of these
[1:57] screaming shouting tongue speaking Acts
[1:59] 238 youngans around her doesn't just say
[2:02] it one time but he says that whooping
[2:04] crying and screaming she doesn't want
[2:07] any of that he says it again later she
[2:09] doesn't want screaming hollering
[2:10] blabbering acts 238 uh babies is what
[2:13] I'll say but he says that that church
[2:15] says they're miserable creatures and he
[2:17] says that she doesn't want to be
[2:19] pregnated with the word because that's
[2:20] the only kind that the word can bring
[2:22] forth say well what kind can the word
[2:24] bring forth the word brings forth
[2:25] screaming shouting tongue talking uh
[2:28] acts 238 which we should have a problem
[2:30] with that at all uh and so there's these
[2:32] things that may accompany it and they
[2:34] don't want that and he says you'll find
[2:36] an old-fashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost
[2:39] filled child born of the spirit of God
[2:41] screaming hollering shouting praising
[2:43] God and he says the church can't bring
[2:46] that forth they don't want to bring them
[2:47] forth they don't want screaming children
[2:48] shouting and speaking in tongues and all
[2:50] them things this is what brother BR
[2:52] saying on the opening night of the
[2:53] meeting and let me just say that Life
[2:56] Tabernacle loved it and agreed with
[2:59] every every bit of that this is what
[3:02] they wanted to hear they they wanted to
[3:04] hear that this is what God produces
[3:06] because they were easily producing that
[3:09] they had the shouting they had the
[3:10] tongue talking they had the dancing and
[3:12] they had all these things that would be
[3:14] a a a response a correct response to the
[3:18] stimulus of the Holy Ghost on an
[3:19] individual's flesh you do not just need
[3:22] the book of Acts to know that when God
[3:24] moves people cry when God moves people
[3:27] dance and and these different things
[3:28] that are indicative of a person who is
[3:31] alive their emotional response to the
[3:34] fire of God and the move of God but in
[3:37] this series if you're taking your time
[3:38] to look at it you'll see that brother
[3:40] brandom is not just leaving the church
[3:42] in that state but there's a focus on
[3:46] maturity there is a focus on recognizing
[3:48] the word for your day there is a word
[3:51] test that comes and and challenges your
[3:53] experience that do you hold to those
[3:55] things as your security blanket or are
[3:58] you willing to walk with the word all
[4:00] the way all the way to where it's
[4:02] leading in this end time to full
[4:04] maturity and to full stature and so a
[4:08] theme that I'd like to introduce and
[4:10] probably hopefully uh in the next two
[4:13] services or so look more on from Frolic
[4:15] to fullness how there is a process of
[4:18] the youngans growing up and not that
[4:20] they ever stop crying not that they ever
[4:22] stop shouting and not that the gifts
[4:24] can't operate in their lives as they
[4:26] mature but the emphasis and the focus
[4:29] and the trajectory trory is growth in
[4:31] the word and there's emotional spiritual
[4:33] maturity and its fullness it's full
[4:35] stature now to mature if we were to use
[4:38] that as a verb it's to grow up to an
[4:40] advanced stage of mental development
[4:42] emotional development uh though we could
[4:45] say it's in the physical aspect since
[4:46] I'm trying to focus more on the
[4:48] spiritual aspect when we say somebody is
[4:50] mature you're looking at their emotional
[4:52] stability their mental uh development
[4:55] and to mature something's to bring to
[4:58] maturity full development a perfection
[5:00] condition when a seed is mature it's as
[5:03] good as it can get and so this is
[5:05] something that is ripe we could say
[5:07] ready for Harvest terms that brother
[5:09] Brenham used about green being green and
[5:11] in Mark 4: 29 it says but when the fruit
[5:14] is brought forth that means it gives
[5:16] itself up when the fruit presents itself
[5:19] who he really is when the fruit shows
[5:22] this is what I've been all along
[5:24] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[5:27] because the Harvest is come so ripness
[5:30] that determines the the the taken away
[5:33] it's maturity that determines the time
[5:35] in which the fruit the seed is harvested
[5:38] and it's when this fruit presents itself
[5:40] as to who it is so in the spiritual
[5:42] sense we are born of Incorruptible seed
[5:45] which is the word of God being born
[5:47] again we are babes in Christ and Peter
[5:50] says in 1 Peter 2:2 as newborn bab babes
[5:54] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[5:56] you may grow thereby termin ology used
[6:00] here in newborn babes is someone just
[6:02] born newborn phrase is actually an
[6:05] infant or a child so he says new born
[6:07] babes not that you would think two years
[6:09] old or three or five but even as uh
[6:12] recently born as an infant just born
[6:14] babes you are to desire the word but the
[6:18] milk appropriate for that time of life
[6:21] and the capacity to to digest and to not
[6:24] being able to not having teeth to chew
[6:26] and not maybe having fully developed
[6:27] reflexes to swallow he's saying that in
[6:30] a spiritual sense we are to to grow by
[6:33] the milk of the word and in growing it's
[6:36] becoming greater or
[6:39] increasing and then Paul touches on this
[6:43] very same process as he's speaking about
[6:45] desire that there's many gifts that God
[6:47] uses and there's Gifts of knowledge and
[6:49] tongues and prophecy a and there's gifts
[6:51] that work within the church and there's
[6:53] gifts of the Spirit there's also fruit
[6:55] of the spirit and and there's different
[6:57] ways that the spirit operates itself and
[6:59] Paul says but let me show you a better
[7:01] way a more excellent way let me show you
[7:02] a greater way and he's saying the
[7:04] greatest is charity and he's speaking of
[7:06] those things and that there's going to
[7:08] be something Perfect come that doesn't
[7:10] nullify do away with or render incorrect
[7:13] any of the other gifts but it just
[7:14] perfects it all and he says uses this
[7:17] when he's speaking about when that which
[7:18] is perfect has come which we do have
[7:20] today by Divine Vindication says when I
[7:23] was a child which is that
[7:25] napos uh that's unable to speak yet he
[7:28] says I spake fake as a child I
[7:30] understood as a child I thought as a
[7:32] child but when I became a man I put away
[7:35] childish things this word napos could be
[7:37] used of one just born cannot speak one
[7:40] that's learning to speak one that's
[7:41] still an adolescent and so it covers
[7:43] these stages of life where one is
[7:45] growing from birth even into teenagehood
[7:47] but then there's a time he says when I
[7:48] became a man and those things which were
[7:51] expected of a child or a teenageer or an
[7:53] adolescent things that you would justify
[7:56] and not think twice of that someone
[7:57] would do of a particular age when I
[7:59] became a man I put away childish things
[8:02] and I was I I was an adult and so there
[8:04] is a process of becoming a man by
[8:06] maturing in growing a process of
[8:09] becoming adults in
[8:11] Christ and then Matthew 11:25 it says at
[8:15] that time Jesus answered and said I
[8:16] thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and
[8:18] Earth because thou Hast hid these things
[8:20] from the wise and prudent they're
[8:22] already mature physically they're
[8:24] already grown up and have knowledge in
[8:26] their head and they think they've got it
[8:28] all figured out and you hid these things
[8:30] from the intellectual and have revealed
[8:32] them unto babes again that napio not
[8:36] able to speak they're still learning
[8:38] they're still acquiring understanding
[8:40] and knowledge it's important to catch
[8:42] that it's not just babes or infants but
[8:44] it's babes in Christ therefore they can
[8:49] learn they have the capacity they have
[8:51] the ability they have the the mechanics
[8:54] and the Dynamics now within them having
[8:57] been born again to have the revelation
[8:59] of the word come to them and then
[9:01] properly grow them into full maturity so
[9:05] though you may be a babe in Christ there
[9:07] is you can if you will submit if you'll
[9:10] listen if you'll obey you can you can
[9:13] grow in
[9:14] Christ and I believe that brother bradam
[9:17] when he's speaking to Life Tabernacle to
[9:20] the Pentecostal Church to leod DEA in
[9:23] those closing uh weeks of his ministry
[9:25] he's there at the end of November
[9:27] speaking these things I believe that
[9:29] he's showing that there is an acts 238
[9:33] experience that we all must have where
[9:34] one is Born Again by the spirit of God
[9:37] and that if the church looks at tongues
[9:39] and says it's no such thing that church
[9:41] is wrong if the church looks at crying
[9:43] and says we won't have none of that here
[9:45] that church is wrong he's saying this is
[9:47] a genuine experience and there's a
[9:48] definite experience that every seed of
[9:50] God must have and that begins in this
[9:53] young these youngans that that that will
[9:56] have certain
[9:58] characteristics and the these babes then
[10:00] are in this condition I'm saying that
[10:02] this is where they grow from and brother
[10:03] Bam's pointing that out through those
[10:05] several services that weekend now if you
[10:08] could turn to Isaiah chapter
[10:10] 28 and we'll just read verses 8 to 11
[10:14] but I the the first uh seven verses on
[10:17] this uh or actually as we just read the
[10:20] first few uh of this there's a crowning
[10:23] moment this crowning achievement and
[10:25] there's this bride that's going to have
[10:27] the mind of Christ she's going to
[10:29] exercise discernment she's going to
[10:31] judge amongst the wicked she's going to
[10:33] judge in the congregation she's going to
[10:35] be able to discern um among them that
[10:38] which is good and that which is evil all
[10:40] these definite end time characteristics
[10:42] of the Bride but at the same time
[10:44] there's those that have aired and
[10:47] they're and they have stumbled in
[10:48] judgment and so there's tables that are
[10:50] full of vomit and like a dog they're
[10:52] returning back to the vomit returning
[10:54] back to traditions and so it's right
[10:56] after this that let's just read verse 8
[10:59] for all tables are full of vomit and
[11:01] filthiness so that there's no place
[11:03] clean and then he says in this kind of a
[11:08] transition but yet now with this in mind
[11:10] since this is what it's going to be at
[11:12] that day this is what God's going to
[11:14] begin and he says Whom Shall he teach
[11:16] knowledge and Whom Shall he make to
[11:19] understand Doctrine them that are weaned
[11:21] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[11:23] how are we going to have these these
[11:25] people who are the the Lord of hosts is
[11:27] a Crown of Glory to a dim of Beauty and
[11:30] the spirit of judgment will be upon them
[11:32] and they'll turn the battle at the gate
[11:33] how are we going to get there it's those
[11:35] that are weaned from the milk and drawn
[11:37] from the breast for precept must be upon
[11:39] precept precept upon precept line upon
[11:41] line line upon line here a little and
[11:43] there a little for with stammering lips
[11:45] and other tongue will he speak to his
[11:47] people the stammering lip in the
[11:49] scripture creates the image and it's
[11:51] used of this infancy uh the stammering
[11:54] lips would be in the sense that sounds
[11:56] are being made but yet it's not uh
[11:58] discern able you're not not able to use
[12:01] not that you're not able to use speech
[12:03] but yet how you're speaking it's
[12:04] stammering it's a stuttering it's not
[12:06] maybe clear and so as the babe in the
[12:09] New Testament would be one napos is no
[12:12] word they're not able to speak clearly
[12:14] articulately this Stam lips another
[12:17] tongue is a prophecy of the day of
[12:20] Pentecost when that day of Pentecost was
[12:22] fully come God begins to pour out his
[12:25] spirit and what happens is in the
[12:27] stammering the stammering is an known
[12:29] tongue it's not clear or discernable or
[12:32] the speech itself you cannot understand
[12:34] except God would give you the Revelation
[12:36] or Quicken you to understand it and so I
[12:39] I'll say this at this moment I'm just
[12:42] trusting the Lord to help me to uh point
[12:45] out these different things as we go
[12:46] along that the Pentecostal age in leod
[12:49] deia this uh last uh the pouring out of
[12:52] his spirit in the 1900s the Pentecostal
[12:55] age represented the restoration of the
[12:57] gifts and brother brandham the most
[12:59] standing part of that was the
[13:01] tongues and he even gets into how
[13:03] there's a debate about it but these
[13:04] tongues how these tongue came in at the
[13:06] end of the Gentile dispensation and
[13:08] there's this pouring out of the Holy
[13:09] Spirit and the Pentecostal age the
[13:11] leodan church age is an age of the
[13:13] restoration of the gifts and tongues
[13:15] brother Braham says in the Rapture which
[13:17] is just a week after he preaches these
[13:19] things uh in the shreport series in the
[13:21] days of the Pentecostals the restoring
[13:24] back of the gifts the restoration of the
[13:26] gifts speaking in tongues casting out
[13:28] devils and the gifts
[13:29] and so the Leo deene age is the
[13:31] Pentecostal age and it is an age that
[13:33] brother brandham clearly identifies and
[13:35] says that within that age there's a
[13:38] distinct departure where in Christ is
[13:40] put out of the church and God is now
[13:42] revealing himself individually to bride
[13:44] members and so he calls it a bride
[13:47] age and in Acts chap 10: 44 to 46 I I
[13:52] was going to read in Acts where and I'm
[13:54] realizing now Shuffle some things up but
[13:57] in Acts chapter 2 when the Holy Spirit
[13:59] fell they begin to speak with unknown
[14:01] tongues the Bible says they spake with
[14:03] um tongues other
[14:06] tongues uh as the spirit gave them
[14:08] utterance so with stammering lips and
[14:10] another tongue so this aspect of this
[14:11] other tongue that begins to manifest on
[14:13] the day of Pentecost then as the
[14:15] gospel's turning to the Gentiles I want
[14:17] you to catch this part in Acts chap 10:
[14:20] 44- 46 while Peter yet spake these words
[14:23] the Holy Ghost fell on all them which
[14:24] heard the word and they of the
[14:26] circumcision which believed were
[14:28] astonished as many as came with Peter
[14:30] because that on the Gentiles also was
[14:33] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[14:35] for they heard them speak with tongues
[14:37] and magnify God so there is and this
[14:41] might stumble some people but just about
[14:43] every single instance so many different
[14:45] instan in the book of Acts when the Holy
[14:47] Spirit was poured out tongues
[14:49] follows and that's why there are those
[14:52] that believe the evidence of being
[14:53] sealed with the Holy Ghost or filled
[14:55] with the Holy Ghost is speaking in
[14:56] tongues they've turned it into an
[14:58] Evidence and seeing people who spoke
[15:01] with tongues turn out to be rank
[15:03] heathens and reject Christ and die in
[15:05] sin they done did away with
[15:07] predestination and so that was maybe the
[15:09] Fallout of choosing uh you know cabbag
[15:12] down on one particular Doctrine and
[15:13] putting a period so the birth of the
[15:15] Gentile Church comes in with tongues
[15:18] signs and wonders the power of God
[15:20] moving in the book of Acts and this is
[15:22] how and I say this to catch this there
[15:25] was Jews that were there on the day of
[15:28] Pentecost in the up room and they are
[15:30] those to whom they were ordained to be
[15:33] there and this was the promise that God
[15:35] gave them in the Old Testament of the
[15:37] Messiah that was to come who was to be a
[15:39] sacrifice and who was to baptize them
[15:41] with fire so they've received their
[15:43] Messiah and this is the Capstone of
[15:46] their messiah's message go and you'll
[15:49] tar there and you'll receive this
[15:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost now to the
[15:53] Gentiles they weren't expecting a
[15:55] prophet they weren't expecting a messiah
[15:58] and so the m of God in the Old Testament
[16:00] is that this climax of the Messiah to
[16:03] the Jews hid the the Revelation that his
[16:06] body was going to be a gentile bride the
[16:08] gospel and the light would turn to the
[16:11] Gentiles and so at when the Holy Spirit
[16:13] now is being poured out of the Gentiles
[16:15] this is the birth of the Gentile
[16:18] church and brother bradam says in in the
[16:20] sermon there is a man here that can turn
[16:22] on the light on the day of Pentecost
[16:25] that was the light that showed when the
[16:26] Holy Ghost had come Isaiah said in the
[16:28] 20th chapter chapter of Isaiah precept
[16:30] must be upon precept line must be upon a
[16:32] line here a little and there a little
[16:34] hold fast to that what's good for with
[16:35] stamy lips and with other tongues will I
[16:37] speak to this people and this is the
[16:39] rest this is the Sabbath that I'll give
[16:41] and all this they would not hear they
[16:43] walked away and wagged their heads so
[16:45] the rest was given but as a whole as a
[16:47] group they rejected it and they turned
[16:50] away from it then there's those of the
[16:51] circumcision during that time of the
[16:53] birth of the church that are coming to
[16:55] Christ from the circumcision and then
[16:58] but there's this uh instance in that day
[17:01] where they rejected this as a nation and
[17:03] when on the day of Pentecost brother
[17:05] brand is speaking when the Holy Ghost
[17:06] fell upon those people they acted like
[17:08] drunk men and women staggering under the
[17:11] impact of the Holy Spirit and they
[17:13] walked away and wagged their heads and
[17:14] said this people's drunk full of new
[17:16] wine and so forth this is the response
[17:18] of those Nations gathered many of those
[17:20] Nations that are gathered there in
[17:22] witness this they say ah they're drunk
[17:25] they're full of new wine they've done a
[17:26] little bit too much but the says
[17:28] absolutely was the light the word that
[17:30] had been prophesied made manifest so on
[17:34] the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[17:35] Spirit is poured out Peter under the
[17:37] inspiration of the Holy Ghost points
[17:39] back to it it's pointing back to Isaiah
[17:41] 25 that was light on Isaiah 28 with
[17:43] stamy lips and other tongues it was
[17:45] light on Joel chapter 2 and brother R
[17:48] saying there's a man that can turn on
[17:49] the light he's showing how God has
[17:51] always shown light on the prophecy for
[17:53] that day and then what does he say in in
[17:56] that sermon there's a man here who can
[17:57] turn on the light he tells a story how
[17:59] that little girl was in a dark cave
[18:01] screaming and crying and hollering and
[18:03] her her brother said don't worry honey
[18:06] there's a man here who could turn on the
[18:08] light and Rapture the church and I
[18:10] believe brother brandham was that
[18:11] brother to the church seeing the the the
[18:14] the anxiety the screaming and the
[18:15] hollering say look there's a man here
[18:17] who could turn on the light and Rapture
[18:19] that church now in Acts 11: 15 he says
[18:23] Peter says and as I begin to speak the
[18:25] Holy Ghost fell on them this is the
[18:28] recounting of Acts chapter 10 there's
[18:30] this Marvel how could the Holy Ghost go
[18:31] to the Gentiles they're dogs or heathens
[18:33] they're not of the circumcision but as
[18:36] the word was being preached the Holy
[18:37] Ghost just poured out on them and it
[18:39] says they spoke with tongues and
[18:40] magnified God and there's even meaning
[18:42] behind that magnifying God this
[18:44] vocalization this praise this shouting
[18:46] that would go up and he says as I begin
[18:48] to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as
[18:50] on us at the
[18:51] beginning in other words the Holy Ghost
[18:54] fell on us and tongues of fire fell on
[18:55] us and we begin to speak with tongues
[18:57] and we begin to shout and praise the
[18:58] Lord this this thing happened and the
[19:00] same thing happened to
[19:02] Gentiles so this is the the birth of the
[19:05] church this is the beginning the
[19:06] stammering lips and the sermon trying to
[19:09] do God a service without being its will
[19:11] has anybody listened to that one here
[19:12] recently Saturday morning of the
[19:14] streetport series Good Wonderful brother
[19:16] says the day of Pentecost the spirit
[19:18] directed it right into that to Joel 238
[19:21] the day of Luther directed it right into
[19:22] that Wesley in this last Pentecostal
[19:25] move if I could just say this the Holy
[19:28] Spirit directed right it into the word
[19:30] for that time but he says but this is
[19:32] another age this is the calling out of
[19:34] the
[19:35] Bride now catch this this is another age
[19:38] in other words this isn't the the church
[19:41] age cycle of Revival and death this is
[19:43] the calling out of a bride out of what
[19:45] Leo
[19:46] deia that when the church had gone
[19:49] lukewarm and kicked Christ out of the
[19:50] church there's an entrance that's open
[19:53] and the bride is called up higher now
[19:55] does the leot dean Church age end uh
[19:58] well let's just look
[19:59] outside it's coming to full maturity we
[20:03] see by Vision them descending in the
[20:05] chaos but at the same time that Leia is
[20:07] descending deeper into darkness there's
[20:09] a bride out of Leo DEA living right here
[20:11] on Earth who's ascending up right now
[20:14] ascending up by the word of God this is
[20:16] another age he says not 2,000 years ago
[20:18] at Pentecost or the repeat or the return
[20:22] and who is he speaking
[20:24] to
[20:26] Pentecostals not 2,000 years ago
[20:29] Pentecost the calling out of the Bride
[20:30] is not exactly what it was then in terms
[20:33] of Prophecy the Holy Spirit was in
[20:36] Luther the Holy Spirit was in Wesley
[20:37] it's God's word being anointed and the
[20:39] Holy Spirit returned to the people of
[20:40] the age and they begin to have the
[20:41] restoration of the gifts same Holy Ghost
[20:44] says they found out by yielding himsel
[20:47] to God the Holy Ghost spoke in tongues
[20:49] through them who did the Holy Ghost did
[20:52] they laid their hands on the sick and
[20:53] they recovered they danced in the
[20:56] spirit this is this is a genuine
[20:59] Bonafide move of God and some of the
[21:02] people that were in Life Tabernacle
[21:04] their parents and Grandparents were
[21:06] there in the beginning brother man
[21:08] preaches return and Jubilee and how that
[21:10] 50 years before that when the spirit of
[21:12] God was pouring out at the birth of that
[21:13] age they were the real genuine
[21:16] Pentecostals the real spirit of God
[21:18] moving upon them restoring the gifts
[21:21] they yielded to God brother says they
[21:23] laid their hands on the sick and they
[21:24] recover they dance in the spirit that
[21:26] was the age of reformation bringing the
[21:29] church back into order you catching this
[21:32] this is the last order of the
[21:33] Reformation this is the last stage to
[21:35] bring back what justification
[21:37] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:38] so that you have a birth you have
[21:40] babes he says and the last order the
[21:42] church was placing the gifts into the
[21:45] church so this is the the the last stage
[21:48] of that that Reformation or we could say
[21:51] a
[21:53] restoration and as it is a restoration
[21:56] but it's not a full restoration
[21:59] he said the Lutheran placed
[22:00] justification Wesley placed
[22:02] sanctification Pentecost placed the
[22:05] gifts but what did they do the same
[22:08] mistake as Nature has patterned to the
[22:09] wheat stock they
[22:11] denominated on
[22:13] what the very things God had restored
[22:17] they denominate what made it so bad to
[22:19] denominate the seed must come back to
[22:21] seed the worst word must come back to
[22:24] fullness and so what they do is they
[22:26] stop oh we justification we've gone far
[22:29] enough sanctification we've gone far
[22:30] enough baptism the ghost we're Justified
[22:32] Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost
[22:33] we're doing these same signs and wonders
[22:34] in the book of Acts and they say we've
[22:36] arrived but God says well no I've just
[22:38] got you back the way you were before and
[22:41] the way that was was a full bride tree
[22:43] but it had never been with the
[22:44] bridegroom tree and before I could come
[22:47] to her she fell and so no you're just
[22:49] back this is the Reformation this is
[22:51] redemption this is the pattern I've
[22:53] showed from the very beginning I want to
[22:55] come now and invisibly Unite with that
[22:57] church to bring for the true fruit of
[22:59] the Union so you're just now coming to
[23:01] that place where you can receive me but
[23:04] they fell away and he says which is
[23:05] against God contrary to
[23:08] God they denominated on those gifts they
[23:11] emphasized those gifts they lift th
[23:13] lifted those things up as the evidence
[23:15] as the penultimate as the ultimate
[23:17] Revival we've gone far
[23:20] enough and we know from these things
[23:22] that brother bam taught the work the
[23:24] specific work of the Holy Ghost today is
[23:26] to not repeat the day of pentec
[23:29] cost because that experience never
[23:31] leaves the
[23:32] church you cannot preach the word of God
[23:35] and say that there is no experience of
[23:36] the Holy Ghost cannot preach the word of
[23:39] God and be a dispensationalist to say oh
[23:41] there's no signs and wonders and there's
[23:43] a lot of there's a lot of scholarship on
[23:45] this there's not e there haven't been
[23:47] evil men in rooms for hundreds of years
[23:50] you know just trying to find a way to
[23:51] defile the church but they've wrestled
[23:53] with these things and said well did the
[23:55] God pour out his Spirit to establish the
[23:57] church and give vindication to the
[23:58] apostles and then once the church was
[24:00] established and the gospel was being
[24:02] preached people could receive it by
[24:03] faith and so God no longer uses those
[24:05] things to establish the gospel and they
[24:07] arrive at that sincerely but sincerely
[24:10] wrong and I'm glad that we had a prophet
[24:12] in this day to be able to just give us
[24:14] the Vindication that no that God did not
[24:16] cease these things these things still
[24:18] exist in the church and so this day of
[24:21] Pentecost experience this baptism of the
[24:24] Holy Ghost this new birth
[24:25] experience as it fell on the day of
[24:27] Pentecost it's the Holy Ghost in Luther
[24:29] holy ghost in Wesley holy ghost in
[24:30] Pentecost it's still the Holy Ghost
[24:32] today in the church but this is a
[24:35] different age and time we've got to
[24:37] consider God's age and time not that
[24:39] that if this is a different age and time
[24:41] that means other things are wrong but
[24:43] what do it led to what's the trajectory
[24:45] what's the accumulation and this is
[24:48] Harvest Time maturing time this is
[24:50] ripening time this is
[24:52] Rapture so in Isaiah 28:9 is it says
[24:56] that there is going to be stand lips and
[24:59] other tongues that I'll speak to this
[25:00] people and that is the day of Pentecost
[25:03] and that is the birth and the beginning
[25:06] he asked this question Whom Shall he
[25:08] teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make
[25:10] to understand Doctrine you catching that
[25:13] phrase who is going to be taught
[25:17] knowledge who is he going to make to
[25:20] understand
[25:21] teaching so he wants to teach knowledge
[25:23] but he wants there to be understanding
[25:25] he wants there to be wisdom he wants it
[25:26] to be practical and applied who's he
[25:28] going to to do it to them that are
[25:29] weaned from the milk and drawn from the
[25:32] breast can you make your connections to
[25:34] First Corinthians and second Peter 1
[25:36] Peter in Mark chapter 4 can you begin to
[25:37] make your connections to Matthew 11 the
[25:39] babes now who would grow by suckling and
[25:42] grow from that milk he says who am I
[25:44] going to teach knowledge and make to
[25:46] understand that
[25:47] teaching them that are weaned they're
[25:50] yielded they're rewarded the milk but
[25:53] then they're weaned which comes from the
[25:55] word to deal fully with so it's not just
[25:58] partial in part to it means to
[26:00] recompense the word means to ripen
[26:02] they're weaned from the milk and drawn
[26:04] from the breast they're removed and
[26:06] taken away from the milk
[26:08] only they who is he going to teach
[26:10] knowledge not not people who stay babies
[26:13] who is he going to make to understand
[26:15] the doctrine who is going to make to
[26:17] understand the teaching who's going to
[26:18] give wisdom to be able to use and apply
[26:21] in work and function and be skillful
[26:23] with what they're being taught those
[26:24] that are not just suckling those who are
[26:27] not just babes Amen in Genesis 21:8 the
[26:30] child grew and was weaned speaking of
[26:32] Isaac it's this time wherein he was
[26:35] taken away from the breast he's no
[26:37] longer milk it's a distinct time in the
[26:39] development of a child and Abraham made
[26:40] a great feast the same day that Isaac
[26:42] was weaned why it's indicating proper
[26:45] development it's indicating growth and
[26:48] maturity that he's not going to have to
[26:49] just drink milk all the time and he's he
[26:51] needs to have a proper diet to
[26:53] physically and emotionally mentally
[26:55] develop and it's one that's growing up
[26:57] appropriately is one that can be taught
[27:00] Abraham sees his son now advancing to a
[27:03] new stage where he's not entirely
[27:05] dependent upon the mom anymore now as
[27:06] the father I can begin to lead him and
[27:08] guide him and now my I become more of an
[27:10] active participant he goes from milk to
[27:13] meat brother brandham says in the sermon
[27:15] what is the Holy Ghost all tables are
[27:17] full of vomit there's no clean place
[27:19] what is he quoting Isaiah 28 verse 8 who
[27:23] shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he
[27:25] make known understand Doctrine you
[27:29] listening them that are weaned from the
[27:31] milk and drawn from the breast not
[27:33] little babies Presbyterian babies
[27:36] Methodist babies Pentecostal babies
[27:37] Lutheran babies Nazarene babies could we
[27:40] say message
[27:41] babies he wants somebody that's willing
[27:43] to get away from the breast and eat some
[27:45] strong
[27:46] meat Hallelujah this is what God wants
[27:49] what is the Holy Ghost what is it given
[27:51] for all these things that brother Bam's
[27:52] teaching he is pointed out in that
[27:54] series even though he might say it's
[27:56] 1959 he's already showing us the time
[27:59] and dispensation that we're living in is
[28:01] where the purpose of the Holy Ghost is
[28:02] filled what is the Holy Ghost given for
[28:04] so he can work so perfectly through us
[28:06] to bring us to a place of adoption
[28:08] wherein this rapturing Grace functions
[28:10] in US fully and completely and it draws
[28:13] the rest of them from the grave and we
[28:14] go in the
[28:16] Rapture and who who are who's going to
[28:18] do that well not little
[28:20] babies somebody willing to be taken away
[28:23] from the
[28:25] milk and eat strong meat
[28:28] Hebrews 5: 11-14 Paul is dealing with
[28:32] his very situation with the Jews and in
[28:35] the Hebrew church he says of whom we
[28:37] have many things to say who is he
[28:39] talking about mezic he's wanting to
[28:41] preach who is this
[28:44] mezic and I do find it interesting that
[28:46] he just goes ahead and does it anyways
[28:48] he says a lot of things about him makes
[28:50] you wonder how much more he wanted to
[28:52] say and brother brandham preaching the
[28:54] same gospel Paul preached brings us this
[28:55] mystery this revelation of who this SM
[28:58] it is says I have many things to say and
[29:01] hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of
[29:05] hearing they didn't have their airpods
[29:07] on too high it's not that they worked in
[29:09] on mechanics or they were uh uh and they
[29:12] had heavy machinery around all the time
[29:14] and they lost their hearing it's like
[29:15] you're not really quick to understand
[29:18] you're not catching these things for for
[29:20] when for the time you ought to be
[29:22] teachers now can you catch the image of
[29:23] scripture who am I going to uh teach
[29:29] knowledge and who will I make to
[29:31] understand that teaching that knowledge
[29:34] them that grow up and so Paul is saying
[29:38] I got a lot of things I want to still
[29:39] teach you but you're
[29:40] still he says because you ought to be
[29:43] teachers why would they be teachers now
[29:45] because the taught shall be as the
[29:48] teacher they should be in a place of
[29:50] maturity to be do the teaching now he
[29:52] says but you have need one teach you
[29:54] again which be the first principles of
[29:56] the Oracles of God and are become such
[29:59] as have need of milk babes youngans and
[30:02] not of strong meat they haven't been
[30:05] weaned from the milk they're not drawn
[30:07] from the breast they find too much
[30:08] comfort in
[30:10] that for everyone that useth milk is
[30:12] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[30:14] for he is a babe it's the image of those
[30:17] that are weaned from the milk and drawn
[30:18] from the breast to be able to teach
[30:20] knowledge and then being taught
[30:21] knowledge they come to a place where
[30:23] they can make use of that they have
[30:25] wisdom and understanding of the word of
[30:26] God so that they become skillful but if
[30:28] you're not skillful in the word of
[30:30] righteousness you're still a babe I
[30:32] don't say that necessar that's not said
[30:34] as condemnation thank God you're a babe
[30:37] right babe thank God this is wonderful
[30:40] this is great that you're babes in
[30:42] Christ and your newborns and You' have
[30:44] the spirit of God working in you
[30:46] but grow
[30:48] up he's a babe but strong meat belongeth
[30:51] to them that are full age mature strong
[30:54] he's speaking speaking
[30:56] spiritually uh
[30:58] I for as young as I can remember my
[31:00] children mean they love
[31:02] steak and they still weren't full
[31:04] age but he's talking about
[31:06] spiritual strong
[31:08] meat even those who have by reason of
[31:11] use have their senses exercised to
[31:13] discern both good and evil for the Lord
[31:16] shall be a Crown of Glory a diadem of
[31:19] beauty a spirit of
[31:20] judgment as we grow up into the Capstone
[31:23] the head which is Christ we're
[31:25] Discerning the truth how by growing up
[31:28] Sister Rogers I meant to say welcome
[31:30] back sister L it's so good to see you
[31:31] today she feeling good she's in the
[31:33] house of the Lord I meant to say that
[31:34] earlier and I forgotten she's just there
[31:36] listening to the word of the Lord we're
[31:38] glad that she's here I hope you can
[31:40] enjoy the picnic
[31:41] today and so he's in this very image of
[31:45] those that grow and as they begin to
[31:47] grow they
[31:48] use as they use they understand how it
[31:51] works right this is how God wants to
[31:52] grow us you understand you know what
[31:54] laying hands on the sick does work you
[31:56] know what confessing does work this is
[31:58] how God works this is how the word works
[32:00] this is how we do things and you're
[32:01] growing now into full stature because
[32:03] you're understanding the word of God and
[32:05] how it works and you are coming to a
[32:07] place that one who is able to use and by
[32:10] using you get greater discernment by
[32:12] having greater discernment you can
[32:14] distinguish between right and wrong and
[32:15] begin to walk a more perfect way
[32:18] am and so in Isaiah 28 God before the
[32:21] spirit is being poured out in order to
[32:23] have those who can learn think about it
[32:25] the wise and prudent th those that whack
[32:28] their heads those that had it all
[32:29] figured out ah they're just drunk forget
[32:30] about it they were the ones that God was
[32:32] turning away from so what did he do he
[32:33] made babes Quicken them to New Life God
[32:36] was not just wanting to have a daycare
[32:38] he's wanting to teach knowledge and make
[32:41] to understand
[32:43] Doctrine so they were to grow it's the
[32:46] same thing that Paul was pointing to
[32:49] they're not growing up you ought to be
[32:51] growing up this is actually the function
[32:53] of the holy spirit that if you've been
[32:54] born again and you have the inside
[32:56] teacher then there ought to be some
[32:57] maturing there ought to be some growing
[32:59] the Holy Ghost can never grow to a point
[33:01] where it denies its own word but you
[33:03] can't be going back you can't be put in
[33:04] a period you can't be going no no no no
[33:06] I spoke with tongues no no no no I spoke
[33:08] with tongues you've got to grow up and
[33:09] mature that's right so he says who can I
[33:15] teach and who can I make to understand
[33:17] the teaching and brother Brown when he
[33:20] preaches the adoption series one of the
[33:21] things he points out that's very
[33:22] critical he says preaching catches The
[33:24] Sinner and brings them under
[33:25] condemnation by the word the ISM the
[33:28] preaching catches The Sinner in his
[33:29] conviction catches him in his sin and
[33:31] the preaching this evangelizing brings
[33:33] him to a place of repentance and he's
[33:35] converted he's born again he's a child
[33:37] of God and then brother bam says but
[33:39] teaching places a man positionally what
[33:41] he is preaching can bring him to a birth
[33:44] to manifest his election but teaching
[33:46] positionally places that son and we can
[33:49] never we can never rightly be able to
[33:51] have faith into positionally we know
[33:53] what we are yes with stamy lips another
[33:57] another tongue he pours out his Spirit
[33:59] upon the Flesh of the people their birth
[34:00] into the word and the word Bible's
[34:02] prophesying it's those young ons that
[34:04] I'm going to teach it's those youngans
[34:06] I'm going to cause to grow up it's those
[34:09] youngans who are cut by the preaching of
[34:11] the Gospel who teaching will place them
[34:13] in the body of Christ who they are and
[34:16] one day the full body of Christ will
[34:18] present itself as a mature woman as a
[34:20] mature
[34:21] Church in Joel chapter 2: 28 and 29 and
[34:26] it shall come to pass afterward that I
[34:28] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[34:31] this is what the Holy Spirit directed
[34:33] Peter to on the day of Pentecost he's
[34:35] pouring out his Spirit upon All
[34:39] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[34:41] shall prophesy your old men shall dream
[34:43] dreams and young men shall see visions
[34:45] and also upon the servants and upon the
[34:46] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[34:49] my spirit we know what this is right
[34:52] this is the day of Pentecost this is the
[34:55] inauguration of the body of Christ this
[34:57] is the gospel
[34:58] Capstone to the
[35:00] Jews and then in this age after a short
[35:02] period of time it begins to turn to the
[35:04] Gentiles and the Gentile Church age
[35:07] actually begins basically with a falling
[35:09] away and you have the church ages and
[35:11] it's a gradual leaving of the word of
[35:14] God is a work of the Antichrist Spirit
[35:16] against the church and it's the age of
[35:19] the Holy Ghost it is the Son of God the
[35:22] Holy Ghost in his church that's a
[35:24] dispensation of the church ages but
[35:26] brother bham says between
[35:28] the Millennium where he's son of David
[35:31] and Le de in church age he reveals
[35:32] himself as the son of man that's
[35:34] bridegroom that's a man about to be
[35:38] married so what he needs is a
[35:41] woman not a babe not a little girl he
[35:45] needs a woman so God pours out his
[35:47] Spirit upon All Flesh this is the
[35:48] inauguration of the church this is the
[35:49] Holy Ghost within human beings as it
[35:51] operates on human flesh we've got enough
[35:53] word to know that's how the Holy Ghost
[35:55] can work but we want to have enough word
[35:56] to know what he's trying to do so Joel
[36:00] 3:13 I've just got to be very quick now
[36:02] he says put put ye in the sickle for the
[36:05] Harvest is
[36:07] ripe get you down for the Press is full
[36:10] the fats overflow for their wickedness
[36:13] is
[36:14] great there Comes A Time in the prophecy
[36:17] of Joel that there is going to be the
[36:19] Holy Spirit poured out upon All Flesh
[36:21] but there's got to come a maturity to
[36:23] follow it is the process of life it is
[36:26] the seed coming to mat
[36:28] whether you be those that are of the
[36:29] seed of God who are going to be
[36:31] harvested in a Rapture or for those
[36:33] whose wickedness is great and you're
[36:34] bundled together by the messenger of
[36:36] this hour into your denominational tears
[36:38] to be
[36:39] burned because he gathers them all in
[36:42] this end time there's a gathering
[36:43] brother brandom even and I I'm realizing
[36:46] I should have maybe put all these down
[36:47] it might even be in the streetport
[36:48] series where he says I'm bundling them
[36:50] all
[36:52] together for
[36:54] judgment so there is an outpouring of
[36:57] this Spirit but there is a harvest
[36:59] that's to be ripe
[37:02] right I might be using right too
[37:06] much right in Hebrews chapter 1 uh the
[37:10] sermon brother BR preached when he does
[37:12] the Hebrew series notice how brother BR
[37:13] deals with this because Paul is writing
[37:16] man you're dull of hearing this this
[37:17] idea of being dull of hearing and
[37:19] needing to be taught again and that's
[37:20] kind of hard to teach somebody who's
[37:21] dull of
[37:23] hearing he wrote one to the Pentecostal
[37:25] Church he's talking about all his
[37:26] letters he wrote one to the Pentecostal
[37:28] church had a lot of troubles with him
[37:30] the Pentecostal church he had more
[37:32] trouble with than anybody else still has
[37:35] it but he was thankful for them the only
[37:38] thing he could teach them when they come
[37:39] in one had a tongue one had a song one
[37:41] had a sensation one had a feeling he
[37:43] couldn't talk or speak to them eternal
[37:46] security he couldn't speak to them
[37:47] predestination he couldn't talk to them
[37:50] they were
[37:51] babies they had to feel something or see
[37:54] something or have funny feelings or
[37:55] something around them some evidence is
[37:58] and don't be upset that's how babies are
[38:02] babies want a they want a security
[38:04] blanket they want their Binky right is
[38:06] that what you had brother Joshua a
[38:07] little Binky right you have a pacifier
[38:09] and you need something that can soothe
[38:11] and you teach a baby and one of the tips
[38:13] we could pass along as parents who
[38:14] didn't always do it right is find
[38:16] something that your child Your Baby Can
[38:18] self sooth self soothe with right
[38:21] something that is svy to them something
[38:24] comfortable something that is a a
[38:26] blanket and we're not to be align us and
[38:29] carried around with this the rest of our
[38:30] comic lives but you come to a point
[38:33] where you get rid of the binky you get
[38:34] rid of the blanket and that's what
[38:35] brother BR saying it's like they still
[38:36] wanted to hold
[38:38] to the things that God gave them in the
[38:40] beginning to help them out and get them
[38:42] moving and and show his presence with
[38:44] them they never grew out of it they were
[38:45] babies they wanted to feel something see
[38:47] something have funny feelings something
[38:49] around them but I believe when he spoke
[38:51] to the Ephesians remember Ephesians is
[38:53] the placing it's the adoption it's the
[38:54] Exodus not just the Exodus but the
[38:56] entrance he could speak on God has
[38:58] predestined us unto sons and daughters
[39:00] and adopted us as children in Jesus
[39:02] Christ before the foundation of the
[39:03] world watch him come over into the book
[39:05] of Romans and so forth they were grown
[39:07] up oh they spoke with tongu sure and
[39:10] they had other signs of the Holy Spirit
[39:12] among them but they didn't make
[39:14] doctrines and Sensations and little
[39:15] Quivers and funny feelings yeah they
[39:18] spoke with tongues they didn't make a
[39:19] big deal out of it yeah they the Holy
[39:22] Ghost moved in signs and wonders and
[39:24] shouting and dancing and screaming and
[39:25] crying you know if anything we should be
[39:28] yeah the Holy Ghost does
[39:30] that right duh you it should be this is
[39:33] what it does it shouldn't be
[39:37] like oh my goodness this is amazing this
[39:39] is so Supernatural let's do this let's
[39:42] build three Tabernacles
[39:47] right they were grown up Paul said
[39:49] you've got extremes with that so he
[39:52] calls it extremes with what Sensations
[39:54] emotions dancing shouting speaking of
[39:56] Tong those are my words you got extremes
[39:58] with that when you ought to be teaching
[40:00] you're still babies and have to have
[40:01] milk this is Brother brandom's words not
[40:03] mine this is him that's what I've always
[40:06] tried to contend this Tabernacle to be
[40:08] not a bunch of
[40:09] babies let's be grown up stand on the
[40:12] road oh my there you are right why
[40:15] because they still always they're always
[40:17] misusing the gift trying to put the
[40:18] gifts forward they're trying to be
[40:20] something they're not or they're trying
[40:21] to emphasize these things I've always
[40:23] tried to contend at this Tabernacle
[40:25] right here in Jeffersonville to not be a
[40:27] bunch bunch of babies but grow
[40:30] up so when Paul said you are dull of
[40:32] hearing brother B said he's always had a
[40:34] problem with the Pentecostal Church he's
[40:36] always had problems with the babies who
[40:37] want to see something feel something
[40:39] have some evidence too much separation
[40:43] anxiety right maybe too much Church
[40:45] abuse that have created these negative
[40:48] Dynamics within Believers lives where
[40:49] they need the pastor to make them feel
[40:51] good they need the altar call to make
[40:52] them feel good they need some sort of
[40:54] visible evidence and some Sensations and
[40:56] funny feelings and to feel like we're
[40:58] good right we're good we're okay we're a
[40:59] good church I'm saved I've got the Holy
[41:01] Ghost everything's going good away with
[41:03] the eighth Messengers away with the
[41:05] Kingdom Builders away with Pastor
[41:07] worship come back as an individual to
[41:09] the word and grow up and stand on your
[41:11] feet as Sons and Daughters of God that
[41:14] know who you
[41:15] [Applause]
[41:16] are but the young ones were dull of
[41:19] hearing in other words they were not
[41:21] growing up and because they were not
[41:22] growing up they're not
[41:24] placeable I had a brother ask me he said
[41:26] i' I've been following what you've been
[41:27] preaching and this when the youngans
[41:29] don't grow up and you've been showing a
[41:30] lot about the maturity and about growing
[41:32] up and what it means to grow up but you
[41:35] I want to know the answer to your
[41:37] title when they don't grow
[41:39] up if they don't grow up they're not
[41:43] placeable when he says they're dull of
[41:45] hearing if you read in the context of
[41:46] the other chapters in Hebrews it implies
[41:48] that they were once first enlightened
[41:51] and they came to know the gospel truth
[41:53] that they were enthused and they were
[41:54] excited and they were growing there was
[41:57] a initial beginning as he says to the
[41:58] Galatians you did start good but what
[42:00] happened now you think you're going to
[42:02] perfect
[42:03] yourself but they had become
[42:06] do and notice what the Bible says in
[42:09] Isaiah
[42:10] 28:13 with stary lips in other tongues I
[42:12] will speak to these people then verse 13
[42:15] but the word of the Lord was unto them
[42:16] precept upon precept precept upon
[42:18] precept line upon line line upon line
[42:20] hear a little and there a little now
[42:22] it's word word word but you have to
[42:25] catch this it's not the full right
[42:27] and because it's not and because God is
[42:30] meeting it out this way that there's
[42:33] going to be a word a word a word here
[42:36] and there and it's going to be a word
[42:38] and because it doesn't come back to
[42:39] fullness or if it's not embraced fully
[42:41] if it's not put together and understood
[42:43] they might go and fall backward and be
[42:46] broken and snared and
[42:48] taken and other words they become hard
[42:50] to move they're dull of hearing it means
[42:52] they're hard to move it's exactly Paul
[42:54] is saying that exactly what the Holy
[42:56] Spirit spoke and Isaiah it's happened
[42:58] because now you're dull of hearing
[43:00] you're hard to move you're failing to go
[43:02] forward you're holding to Traditions
[43:04] you're holding to the flesh yeah line
[43:06] here line there precept here precept
[43:08] there there's all great embrace them but
[43:10] because it's partial it's incomplete
[43:12] it's intermittent it causes them to fall
[43:14] back and not go forward he says they go
[43:16] fall back they're broken they're snared
[43:18] they're
[43:18] taken so God must do something to break
[43:22] this
[43:23] cycle to break the cycle of tradition
[43:26] and man made Creeds and putting periods
[43:28] on the word of God and the religion and
[43:30] there's got to be a Breaking of the
[43:32] cycle of the church Ages which is
[43:34] Revival than
[43:38] death remember how we were reading in
[43:40] Isaiah how that there
[43:42] is at this very time that there's going
[43:45] to be those who are coming to sharp
[43:47] razor sharp discernment with this Crown
[43:49] of Glory upon him it speaks of the Bride
[43:51] in this end time when this man becomes
[43:54] this hiding place at the very same time
[43:56] there's those that had air through wine
[43:59] inspiration sensation feeling
[44:01] intoxification
[44:02] Isaiah 29: 9-14 he says stay yourselves
[44:06] turn here if you could or please take
[44:07] note of this stay yourselves and wonder
[44:10] cry out and cry they are drunken but not
[44:13] with wine they stagger but not with
[44:16] strong drink remarkable parallel to the
[44:19] very thing that Peter says at the
[44:20] inauguration of the church on the day of
[44:22] Pentecost these men are not drunk as you
[44:24] suppose but now instead of spiritual
[44:26] discernment they're senses are dled
[44:29] becomes a parallel to the L de an
[44:31] outpouring wherein God moves amongst
[44:32] them and in 15 years they denominate
[44:34] they got zero discernment anymore God
[44:36] called them out of organization then
[44:38] they begin to organize around sensation
[44:39] organize around uh evidences and because
[44:42] this church does this then we don't
[44:44] agree with them and because they do that
[44:45] we're going to do this and it's just a
[44:47] bunch of
[44:50] fighting they're drunk but not with wine
[44:53] they stagger but not with strong
[44:54] drink and at the outpouring of the Holy
[44:57] Holy Spirit in this age and in the
[44:59] restoration of the gifts in this hour
[45:02] the church was
[45:05] dull for the Lord hath poured out upon
[45:08] you the spirit of deep sleep and hath
[45:09] closed your eyes the prophets and your
[45:12] rulers the seers hath he covered there's
[45:15] this dullness this this lack of teaching
[45:17] understanding nobody has the TR full
[45:19] truth the spirit of Deep Sleep comes
[45:21] over the whole church the spirit of deep
[45:23] sleep is upon those and in Matthew
[45:25] chapter 25 when he gives the the parable
[45:27] of the wise and foolish virgin when the
[45:29] bridegroom carried they all slumbered
[45:31] and slept Spirit of deep sleep this
[45:34] drunkenness and wine and these things
[45:37] and even after the return of the gifts
[45:39] to the church the church is sleeping as
[45:41] it approaches
[45:43] midnight the sleeping church has not
[45:45] fulfilled the promise of the Reformation
[45:47] words they've been reformed but the
[45:49] promise of the Reformation is perfection
[45:52] it's not a full restoration of the word
[45:54] Christ because they actually put Christ
[45:55] out of the church brother BR said the
[45:57] Pentecostal age did not
[46:00] restore when he says it did not restore
[46:02] it doesn't mean they didn't restore the
[46:03] gifts the language is too plain that it
[46:04] did but he's talking about the full
[46:06] promised restoration but God has to
[46:08] restore for he cannot deny his word the
[46:11] Pentecostal age did not perfect it did
[46:14] not
[46:15] mature they they were it brought it back
[46:18] to the birth but they need to be weaned
[46:19] from the milk they need to be drawn from
[46:21] the breast they need to be taught the
[46:22] word this is why even brother brownman
[46:25] his own Ministry has to come back and
[46:26] bring them back to the beginning of
[46:28] these things New Birth experience and
[46:30] these fundamental doctrines he had to
[46:32] even restore what the L Dean age was
[46:36] losing in order to be a son of man to
[46:38] reveal the son of man in order to be
[46:39] Revelations 10:7 he had to be the angel
[46:42] of the seventh Church age to get them
[46:44] back to even where they were to know
[46:45] that an entrance has been opened up to
[46:47] have an audience with
[46:50] Christ the Pentecostal age not fully
[46:53] restore and think about it in terms of
[46:54] the life Messengers those four death
[46:57] Messengers Whittle it down to nothing
[46:58] there's got to be four that bring it
[47:00] back Christ is the
[47:01] fourth in that valley of dry bones they
[47:04] all come up and it looks like an army
[47:07] but what are they they're sleeping the
[47:10] prophecy has to go forth again and
[47:11] animate them and come to a standing on
[47:13] their feet mature Army so at the
[47:16] Pentecostal age in Leo DEA this is the
[47:18] promise of Leo DEA you have a church
[47:21] that looks like it's almost
[47:24] there only thing is is they're missing
[47:26] seen
[47:27] something this is what some of you look
[47:31] like they've got to have that word
[47:34] come the final piece so it says in verse
[47:38] 11 about this church the Pentecostal
[47:41] church and the vision of all of all
[47:42] things is become unto you as the words
[47:44] of a book that is
[47:47] sealed a sealed book Revelations 5 which
[47:51] men delivered to one that has learned
[47:52] saying read this I pray and he saith I
[47:54] cannot for it is sealed even the learned
[47:57] it's sealed to them and the book is
[47:58] delivered to him that is not learned
[48:00] saying read this I pray that he say I'm
[48:01] not
[48:03] learned the book is sealed and no man
[48:05] can elose it no man can read it they're
[48:08] not even worthy to look upon it here is
[48:09] this sealed book the vision of all the
[48:11] vision of all what is it Redemption
[48:13] restoration fullness and it's a sealed
[48:16] book and at the Pentecostal age of Le
[48:19] desent age there's no Revelation in
[48:20] Revelations 5 the book is sealed no one
[48:23] can open
[48:24] it this is the picture of the Leo Dean
[48:27] Church the Gentile
[48:30] bride brother Bram said in God's
[48:32] provided place of worship he says
[48:34] neither does the Pentecostal know what's
[48:35] going on
[48:37] today they don't know what's going on
[48:38] today the vision is sealed brother Bram
[48:42] right or preaches when he's preaching
[48:44] the revelation of Jesus Christ in 19160
[48:46] he's preaching on the th trean Church
[48:47] age what happened when Pentecost came
[48:49] along speaking in tongues and bringing
[48:51] the restoration of the gifts they
[48:52] couldn't move called them Devils who's
[48:54] he saying the weslan the methodists
[48:55] couldn't move they called them Devils
[48:58] don't make the same mistake the
[48:59] methodists did which they were a little
[49:00] bit more
[49:02] charismatic sometimes we think you know
[49:05] screaming and shouting his original
[49:06] Pentecost and we're thinking bride age
[49:08] stuff and well the methodists were doing
[49:10] it
[49:11] too and he says uh the that that group
[49:15] couldn't move called them Devils now
[49:17] what's the Pentecost done they did the
[49:20] same thing and where are they at just as
[49:23] dead as a doornail
[49:27] the church is dead brother B the third
[49:28] seal says they're sleeping there's been
[49:30] no manifestation of God to stir up it's
[49:33] going to take the open of that book and
[49:34] the revelation of the seven Thunders to
[49:36] Quicken her to life not a restoration of
[49:38] the gifts not a going back to isusa
[49:40] Street not going back to some other age
[49:42] but recognizing the promise for your age
[49:45] and the prophet stands there and says
[49:47] there does not need to be a restoration
[49:48] of these things God has restored them
[49:50] those Messengers has come the branches
[49:52] the leaves the shouting the tongues and
[49:54] those things it's already here but wck
[49:56] ize your day and its
[49:59] message can you grow
[50:04] up just as dead as a
[50:06] doornail verse 13 wherefore the Lord
[50:09] said for as much as this people draw
[50:11] near me with their mouth and with their
[50:15] lips
[50:18] right but have removed their heart from
[50:21] me and their fear toward me is taught by
[50:24] the precept of men
[50:28] these are the hearts of the children
[50:31] that need to be
[50:34] restored by Malachi
[50:36] 4 notice he restores the hearts of the
[50:40] children why does he have to restore
[50:42] hearts of
[50:43] children so they can
[50:47] grow that you'd be no more children as
[50:51] long as your heart hasn't turned you
[50:52] can't grow up so the prophet's first
[50:55] order of business is restore you back to
[50:58] Pentecostal youngans but he didn't want
[51:00] you to stay a Pentecostal young he wants
[51:03] you to grow
[51:06] up and from a heart from the heart a man
[51:10] speaketh and here they're speaking but
[51:13] they don't have the right
[51:14] heart but then he says therefore
[51:16] remember we're looking at the situation
[51:18] say well what's going to stop it
[51:20] therefore
[51:22] behold I will proceed to do a marvelous
[51:24] work among this people
[51:27] even a marvelous work and a Wonder for
[51:30] the wisdom of their wise men Shall
[51:32] Perish and the understanding of their
[51:34] prudent men shall be
[51:36] hid they're wise they're prudent they're
[51:39] strong they're bold they're courageous
[51:41] all their religion tradition and all
[51:43] their their workups and whatever they
[51:44] got he says I'm going to do a marvelous
[51:46] work and theirs will perish theirs will
[51:49] be hid God prophesies a Wonder a
[51:54] marvelous work but remember not great in
[51:57] Man's eyes great in God's eyes oh
[52:01] brother bam shouldn't this be in some
[52:02] great big Cathedral shouldn't this be
[52:03] this shouldn't we shouldn't we be doing
[52:05] this shouldn't we do it just live simple
[52:07] people are looking for some great
[52:08] fantastic we right over the top of
[52:11] it let's skip to verse
[52:14] 16 I'm going to do something great I'm
[52:16] going to do something
[52:17] wonderful the vision of all has become
[52:19] as a sealed book but I'm going to do
[52:20] something marvelous I'm going to do
[52:21] something great and this is going to be
[52:23] this going to be how we go from stamy
[52:25] lips and other tongues and this is how
[52:27] we go back to those that can be taught
[52:29] and those that can be trained and those
[52:30] that can grow surely your turning of
[52:32] things upside down shall be esteemed as
[52:33] The Potter's clay for shall the work of
[52:36] him say that made it he made me not or
[52:38] shall the thing framed say of him that
[52:40] framed it he had no understanding my
[52:43] goodness is it not yet a very little
[52:45] while and Lebanon shall be turned into a
[52:47] fruitful field and the fruitful field
[52:49] shall be esteemed as a forest growing
[52:53] up and in that day shall the death hear
[52:57] the words of the book and the eyes of
[53:00] the blind shall see out of obscurity and
[53:02] out of
[53:04] Darkness there's going to be a day when
[53:06] that sealed book the vision of alls
[53:09] becomes a sealed book and no man is
[53:10] worthy to open it and there's a lack of
[53:13] understanding there's a lack of teaching
[53:14] and there's a famine for the word of God
[53:16] I will do something wonderful and when
[53:18] this thing is wonderfully done in that
[53:20] day ears will hear the words of the book
[53:22] and the eyes of the blind will now begin
[53:24] to see
[53:27] in Isaiah 32:3 I got to go quickly now
[53:29] just to tie these things together all
[53:32] the eyes of them that see shall not be
[53:34] dim and the ears of them that she hear
[53:36] shall be shall hearken what are you
[53:39] going to see the book what are you going
[53:41] to hear the word you're going to hear
[53:43] the words of the sealed book God is
[53:45] going to teach you knowledge and make
[53:47] you to understand the
[53:50] teaching the deaf hearers will hear the
[53:53] words of the sealed book The Eyes Of The
[53:54] Blind will see out of the darkness and
[53:56] we see through a glass Darkly and this
[53:58] is that befuddlement but then face to
[54:00] face and the veil is taken away it's
[54:02] turned to the Lord the book is open sent
[54:05] back down to earth it's revealing whose
[54:07] names are in
[54:10] there in verse 4 Isaiah 32:4 now notice
[54:15] this the heart also of the
[54:17] rash shall understand knowledge who is
[54:20] he going to teach knowledge here we are
[54:23] this is what's happening the open of the
[54:25] word now who am I going to teach
[54:28] knowledge these people who am i g to
[54:31] make understand that teaching these
[54:33] people the heart also of the rash shall
[54:36] understand knowledge and the tongue of
[54:38] the
[54:39] stammerers shall be ready to speak
[54:42] plainly oh he pours out his Spirit
[54:45] they're stammering lips and it's
[54:47] wonderful Paul said he did it more than
[54:49] anybody else brother B said he wish
[54:51] everyone in the church could do it
[54:52] shouting dancing screaming crying all
[54:53] wonderful Holy Ghost does it but there
[54:55] Comes A Time when you got to speak
[54:58] plainly the restoration of the gifts was
[55:00] the stammering lips it was the unknown
[55:01] tongues but the heart is turned to
[55:03] understand knowledge the heart of the
[55:05] rash that's speaking of the expectant
[55:08] those that are looking for
[55:10] waiting Zephaniah 389 therefore wait ye
[55:13] upon the Lord sayith the Lord until the
[55:15] day that I Rise up to the prey for my
[55:17] determination is to gather the Nations
[55:19] that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour
[55:21] out upon them my indignation even all my
[55:24] Fierce anger for all the Earth shall be
[55:25] devoured with fire of my jealousy here
[55:28] we are in the end time the bundling of
[55:30] the tears the Judgment of the Bride out
[55:32] of the church here he is it's revealed
[55:34] himself as the wig one the Supreme judge
[55:37] in this hour saying denominations are
[55:39] done they're over they've crucified the
[55:41] word of fresh now he begins to separate
[55:44] now he begins to call you out and he
[55:46] says for then will I turn the people to
[55:48] a pure language that they may call upon
[55:51] the name of the Lord to serve him with
[55:53] one consent that's one back One Vision
[55:55] one word amen the tongue of the stammer
[55:58] shall be ready to speak plainly
[56:03] amen Isaiah 30: 20 to 22 and though the
[56:07] Lord give you the bread of Avers and the
[56:09] water of Affliction here's the prophecy
[56:11] to those while there's people are
[56:13] intoxicated and running after false
[56:15] doctrines and building kingdoms and all
[56:16] their platitudes and the Pentecostal
[56:18] church is going into chaos he says yet
[56:20] shall not thy teachers be removed into a
[56:22] corner anymore remember they're seers
[56:24] and their prophets they're all do but
[56:26] now you're going to have teachers Thine
[56:29] Eyes shall see thy teachers thy ears
[56:31] shall hear a word behind thee saying
[56:33] this is the way walk ye in it when you
[56:36] turn to the right hand and when you turn
[56:37] to the left remember when brother Bram
[56:40] had a vision of the preview of the bride
[56:42] and she came through beautiful beautiful
[56:44] church then the succession of church
[56:46] ages and then the leot deyan church age
[56:48] came through dancing the rock and roll
[56:50] music a big whoop them up shouting and
[56:52] and dancing to rock and roll music and
[56:54] brother man says oh my goodness is this
[56:55] what my message has produced I wonder
[56:57] what he saw to make him think that was
[56:59] associated with his
[57:02] message and then they begin to descend
[57:05] down into darkness he says but then the
[57:06] bride must come into preview again and
[57:09] they go marching and what was it
[57:11] sweetly Onward Christian
[57:14] Soldiers and as they pass by him and he
[57:16] looks some of them who are looking at
[57:18] that L desan Church saying sure looks
[57:21] like they're having
[57:22] fun begin to get out of step and they
[57:25] heard a word behind them
[57:27] saying this is the way walk you in it
[57:31] get back in Step get back in line this
[57:33] is the way walk you in
[57:35] it these scriptures are being
[57:38] fulfilled the ears are hearing the words
[57:41] of the book the eyes are seen out of
[57:42] darkness and in obscurity the eyes of
[57:44] the dim shall see the ears shall hear
[57:46] and the tongue of the stammers shall be
[57:48] ready to speak plainly with
[57:51] understanding clear and bright not
[57:55] unknown no longer children but
[58:05] mature because the bride must according
[58:07] to Revelations 10
[58:10] prophesy
[58:13] again when do they prophesy
[58:16] again after taking the book
[58:29] to prophesy is to declare
[58:32] things that can only be known by
[58:37] revelation we are told in spiritual way
[58:40] but yet very literal to go to him who
[58:42] has the book to take
[58:44] it and he says take it and eat it up and
[58:46] in eating the book it says Thou must
[58:48] prophesy again before many peoples and
[58:50] Nations and tongues and Kings it's after
[58:52] eating the book your ears hear or eyes
[58:55] see
[58:56] and we to
[59:04] prophesy the bride is going to declare
[59:07] things that can only be known by
[59:09] Revelation the tongues of leoda it's the
[59:12] work of the Holy Ghost was Stam your
[59:13] lips and other tongues will I speak but
[59:15] they were not
[59:16] plain the word had not been restored the
[59:19] right teaching had not come they're not
[59:21] speaking with a full understanding but
[59:24] to speak plainly
[59:26] is to speak with new tongues but brother
[59:28] R said that's spiritual
[59:32] Revelation this is why brother brandham
[59:34] says in the invisible Union the word
[59:35] that fell in the day of Pentecost will
[59:37] not work for this
[59:38] day that was for Pentecost this is for
[59:41] the bride going home of the Bride we've
[59:43] got something different the Pentecostals
[59:46] UPC Life Tabernacle leod DEA they
[59:49] represented that day that aspect of the
[59:51] day of Pentecost the restoration of the
[59:52] gifts again we're in the bride age it's
[59:56] the age of speaking plainly right the
[59:59] it's from Frolic to fullness from green
[1:00:02] to
[1:00:03] mature this is what we're this is the
[1:00:06] emphasis of the holy spirit in this hour
[1:00:08] do we do we still speak in tongues some
[1:00:10] of you have done it right here do we
[1:00:13] still cry do we still shout do we still
[1:00:14] dance God move upon us let your Holy
[1:00:17] Spirit pour out and let each person
[1:00:20] individually have the Liberty within
[1:00:22] themselves to enjoy the presence of God
[1:00:24] but let us not make a church or
[1:00:26] Tabernacle on any of it let us continue
[1:00:28] to say this is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:00:32] him the time and the hour that we're
[1:00:35] living in now is not an age of Frolic
[1:00:37] it's an age of
[1:00:39] maturity it's an age of growing
[1:00:41] up this third poll is not a public show
[1:00:45] and we'll enjoy the public shows while
[1:00:47] we have them but the real work the real
[1:00:50] meat is happening by revelation of the
[1:00:51] word of
[1:00:52] God in Mark 7:35
[1:00:56] excuse me 32 to 35 I might have that
[1:00:58] wrong on there and they bring speaking
[1:01:01] of Jesus I'm at the very end brother
[1:01:03] John I'm skipping a whole bunch you'll
[1:01:04] have the luxury of being able to read
[1:01:05] all these scriptures and quotes I'm
[1:01:07] skipping and they bring unto him one
[1:01:09] that was deaf and had an impediment in
[1:01:11] his speech dull of hearing being dull of
[1:01:14] hearing you're not able to speak clearly
[1:01:16] he has an impediment in his speech his
[1:01:18] tongue is tied and they beseech him to
[1:01:19] put his hand upon him and he took him
[1:01:22] aside from the multitude
[1:01:26] your master has come go you out to meet
[1:01:29] him called away from the MERS called
[1:01:32] away from the audience called away from
[1:01:34] the show has this personal private
[1:01:37] audience in this third pole example and
[1:01:40] he took him aside from the multitude put
[1:01:42] his fingers in his ears and spit and
[1:01:44] touched his tongue mouth to mouth and
[1:01:47] looking up to heaven he sighed and said
[1:01:49] unto
[1:01:50] him that is be opened
[1:01:57] that book was sealed and you were sealed
[1:01:59] the book was opened you're opened in
[1:02:02] straight way his ears were opened and
[1:02:05] the string of his tongue was loosed and
[1:02:08] he spake
[1:02:10] plain this is the hour this is the time
[1:02:13] this is the day with stamy lips and
[1:02:16] other tongues will I pour out my spirit
[1:02:18] upon All Flesh and they will speak with
[1:02:20] unknown tongues and they'll speak with
[1:02:21] another tongue and on the day of
[1:02:23] Pentecost they begin to speak in another
[1:02:25] tongue and what happened others heard it
[1:02:27] in their own language and it said that
[1:02:30] men from all over the world were
[1:02:31] gathered together out of every nation
[1:02:33] under heaven and when the Holy Ghost
[1:02:35] fell they began to speak with other
[1:02:36] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:02:38] utterance and they were all confounded
[1:02:40] because every man heard them speak in
[1:02:43] his own language brother bradam said
[1:02:45] that the leod dean Pentecostal tongues
[1:02:47] was back to the Tower of
[1:02:50] Babel because all it was was
[1:02:53] tongues and Paul taught the church
[1:02:55] except you utter by tongue's words easy
[1:02:57] to be understood how shall it be known
[1:02:59] what is
[1:03:00] spoken if you know not the meaning of
[1:03:02] the voice you're nothing more than a
[1:03:05] barbarian crude and rude speech speaking
[1:03:08] a foreign language that can't be
[1:03:11] understood he says you should seek that
[1:03:13] you may excel to the edifying of the
[1:03:15] church if I speak with tongues pray with
[1:03:17] tongues sing with tongues he says my
[1:03:19] understanding is unfruitful but if I'm
[1:03:21] going to do anything I want it with
[1:03:23] understanding if I'm going to sing let
[1:03:25] me sing with understanding if I'm going
[1:03:26] to pray let me pray with understanding
[1:03:28] if I'm going to enjoy the fruit of the
[1:03:30] spirit if I'm going to enjoy the gifts
[1:03:31] of the Spirit let me still with El my
[1:03:33] getting get
[1:03:36] understanding I'd rather speak five
[1:03:38] words with understanding he said that my
[1:03:40] voice with that by my voice I might
[1:03:42] teach others also what is the emphasis
[1:03:46] what is greater what is what has its
[1:03:48] worth the greatest worth the word of God
[1:03:52] taught than 10,000 words in an unknown
[1:03:54] tongue I'd rather have five words five
[1:03:58] words to teach than a 10,000 words that
[1:04:02] can't be understood he says Brethren
[1:04:04] this is 1 Corinthians chapter 14:20
[1:04:06] Brethren be not children in
[1:04:09] understanding how be it in Malice be
[1:04:11] children be innocent don't be
[1:04:12] experienced with it but in understanding
[1:04:15] be
[1:04:17] men he said tongues verse 22 brother
[1:04:21] John wherefore tongues are for a sign
[1:04:25] not to them that
[1:04:26] believe but to them that believe
[1:04:29] not but
[1:04:30] prophesying serveth not for them that
[1:04:33] believe not but for them which
[1:04:39] believe brother brandom said they shall
[1:04:41] speak with new tongues I don't mean the
[1:04:43] uncertain sound they speak with
[1:04:44] knowledge with Revelation they had a
[1:04:46] real gift of speaking in tongues there's
[1:04:49] something takes place when they do
[1:04:51] that's not uncertain that's no sound of
[1:04:53] unbelief not at all if it's a lot of
[1:04:56] carrying on like we see a lot of times
[1:04:57] that's
[1:04:59] unbelief but when you speak with words
[1:05:02] with interpretation with Revelation
[1:05:04] Hallelujah that's the gospel Bell
[1:05:06] tolling it's no uncertain sound
[1:05:08] amen what is it bringing you to that
[1:05:11] Royal diadem that clear speech the
[1:05:13] tongue of the stammers the babes who've
[1:05:15] been birthed by the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:17] Ghost who shouted who danced who cried
[1:05:19] who rejoiced to frolic they grow up to
[1:05:22] fullness and they are able to speak
[1:05:25] clearly
[1:05:26] and
[1:05:28] plainly what's beautiful about the mark
[1:05:30] of maturity is that the more mature we
[1:05:32] become the better we're able to
[1:05:33] articulate and speak to those who don't
[1:05:35] understand humble ourselves to get down
[1:05:37] on their level take someone who's
[1:05:39] matured a little bit to be a mom matured
[1:05:41] a little bit to be a dad to have the
[1:05:42] patience to work with the young on so
[1:05:44] that they could grow
[1:05:48] up my goodness with the spiritual
[1:05:50] nonsense
[1:05:51] today preachers are changing the
[1:05:54] congregation's diaper and the
[1:05:55] congregation is changing the preachers
[1:05:59] diaper but Isaiah 32: 5 and 6 the vile
[1:06:03] person shall be no more called liberal
[1:06:06] nor the turl said to be
[1:06:08] bountiful now notice this is
[1:06:11] discernment there's full understanding
[1:06:13] the vile which is foolish is not going
[1:06:16] to be called liberal which is
[1:06:18] Noble you're going to know the vile are
[1:06:21] foolish they're not Noble you're going
[1:06:23] to know the churl the one that's a
[1:06:25] scoundrel he's not rich what is it you
[1:06:28] come to discern between good and evil
[1:06:30] you're growing up you can catch the
[1:06:32] spirit of things you going to say well
[1:06:34] yeah that's that's all good that's good
[1:06:35] yeah Holy Spirit does that but that's
[1:06:36] not the oh that's that's good that's
[1:06:38] wonderful but there there's
[1:06:40] more because notice the vile person will
[1:06:42] speak villainy because why his heart
[1:06:45] will work iniquity to practice hypocrisy
[1:06:47] heart's not turned language doesn't
[1:06:48] change and to utter err against the Lord
[1:06:51] and to make empty the soul of the hungry
[1:06:53] and he'll cause the drink of the Thirsty
[1:06:54] to fail this is Pentecost
[1:06:59] diagnosed it works his faith and I can
[1:07:01] say this there was a word test in there
[1:07:03] brother B touches on that quite a bit in
[1:07:04] that Series in
[1:07:06] Shor works as Faith expressed it's a
[1:07:08] wonderful one to go through to look at
[1:07:10] it's
[1:07:11] beautiful the heart of the chur is H
[1:07:14] hypocritical they speak and they utter
[1:07:15] things that are empty that deprive the
[1:07:17] people of their substance but there's
[1:07:18] going to be a bride that begins to speak
[1:07:20] plainly that grows up and works as Faith
[1:07:24] expressed he says they could not follow
[1:07:25] Israel out why they were denominational
[1:07:27] Egyptian
[1:07:28] babies they could not follow that word
[1:07:32] if they did they had to leave Egypt n
[1:07:34] was good to them and they couldn't do it
[1:07:36] although they could impersonate The
[1:07:37] Works do what Moses did but their Folly
[1:07:40] was made manifest when it come time to
[1:07:42] leave then God really poured it out out
[1:07:45] on them same now they might do all kinds
[1:07:49] of false impersonations and things that
[1:07:52] don't do nothing but magnify the right
[1:07:54] thing and any believing child knows
[1:07:57] that's the truth here you see in plain
[1:07:59] view then the works of their Folly of
[1:08:01] their
[1:08:03] impersonation brother Bram is speaking
[1:08:05] very hard very
[1:08:06] plain to the Le Dean Church
[1:08:10] age brother Bram says in the sermon
[1:08:12] musicians please come and trying to do a
[1:08:15] god of service without it being its will
[1:08:17] the tongues of the stammers shall be
[1:08:19] ready to speak
[1:08:21] plainly our ears will be opened and our
[1:08:23] tongue will be loosed and we I'll speak
[1:08:26] plainly the bride will
[1:08:29] prophesy
[1:08:34] again declare things that are only known
[1:08:38] by
[1:08:39] Revelation he says now is the bride
[1:08:43] calling now is when the Seven Seals have
[1:08:46] been opened now when the complete things
[1:08:48] that the reformers left has to be opened
[1:08:52] and only Malachi 4 can do that because
[1:08:55] it takes the Revelation straight from
[1:08:56] God to an individual to do
[1:09:00] so listen the ministry of Malachi 4 is
[1:09:03] to restore the hearts of the children
[1:09:05] back to their Pentecostal
[1:09:09] fathers is it back to Pentecost yes you
[1:09:12] got to go got to go back to Pentecost
[1:09:15] but what is unique to the Pentecostal
[1:09:17] experience the Seal of
[1:09:20] God that's the most important thing but
[1:09:23] notice those p hostile fathers are now
[1:09:26] what fathers they grew
[1:09:28] up and so we too in pattern enter into
[1:09:31] Hearts being restored back as children
[1:09:34] to the Faith of Our Fathers it's a faith
[1:09:36] that begins and it's a faith that's
[1:09:39] finished and that's the work of the Holy
[1:09:41] Ghost in This Hour this is what the
[1:09:43] message of the hour is doing now brother
[1:09:46] brandham said in the invisible Union
[1:09:47] we're at the end so what does it have to
[1:09:50] do now lay in the presence of the sun to
[1:09:54] be ripened
[1:09:56] the word to be ripened in your heart to
[1:09:58] bring forth and live what we're talking
[1:10:03] about maybe Lord willing on Wednesday
[1:10:05] night we'll get into that that greenness
[1:10:07] a little
[1:10:09] bit but I I I just felt I I thought I
[1:10:12] was going to go a little bit different
[1:10:13] direction today because I wanted to get
[1:10:15] into when they don't grow up and and
[1:10:18] hopefully conclude this series this sub
[1:10:20] series here pretty soon
[1:10:28] if you're green it means you got life in
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:36] and you don't want to fail to grow
[1:10:40] up so that the life
[1:10:42] leaves and you're
[1:10:46] dead and so there's there's a difference
[1:10:48] there's there's a one median medium
[1:10:51] there's one
[1:10:52] middle between starchy
[1:10:55] and and and
[1:10:57] fleshly and it's right in the middle
[1:10:59] with God's
[1:11:01] word and there's a pattern for this and
[1:11:03] where it is today is laying in the
[1:11:05] presence of the sun to be ripened to
[1:11:07] bring forth and live the message that
[1:11:09] brother Brandon was
[1:11:11] preaching and we're living in a time
[1:11:13] there has been a great outpour to the
[1:11:14] Holy Spirit the bride is enjoying all
[1:11:16] that the Holy Ghost has for her and we
[1:11:19] allow God to do and move as he would see
[1:11:22] fit but we know where the spirit of the
[1:11:23] Lord is there's liberty and what does
[1:11:25] that mean there's liberty to
[1:11:28] become men Liberty to become
[1:11:32] women the Liberty that it's been turned
[1:11:34] into is not the Liberty that the Bible
[1:11:35] speaks
[1:11:36] of and so the most important thing is
[1:11:39] for the word to be ripened in our heart
[1:11:40] to bake out all the greenness so we
[1:11:43] could come into the First full
[1:11:45] stature in this Union with
[1:11:48] Christ for it's through this invisible
[1:11:50] Union that's going to bring forth the
[1:11:52] full word to be born into manifestation
[1:11:56] again God bless you I'd like to pray
[1:11:57] with you amen let's stand
