TRANSCRIPT
========================================
christ we pray amen amen i'd like to read from second corinthians chapter 1 verses 3 to 11. second corinthians chapter 1. we'll start with verse 3 and we'll go to to verse 11. and we're going to try pick up where we were on sunday when we stopped i felt a little bit empty because we had maybe just shared about half of what was on our heart on sunday and then we just felt like it was the lord's will that we could pick up on these things and go a little bit further into it and trust it'll be a blessing to you as of right now i didn't check in the last couple hours or so but as of right now we we don't know who the next president will be and uh depending on who you ask um we just uh it's just remarkable how god does things and how god's in control of all things and i feel that the lord allowed the last 24 hours to unfold in probably the most reasonable peaceful way possible because it's too early for anybody to do anything and it'll probably just drag itself on in the courts for three months and by then any gander that was up any adrenaline any anger just everyone will be projecting it somewhere else and we might be able to transition either into a second term for president trump or into a first term and a transition to a new administration with uh joe biden but either way we are in god's care and either way regardless of what who the president is we we are represented we are identified with america as americans and so we we bear it shame we bear the reproach of it whatever it might be we just have to accept it uh but i think the what's transpired over the last 24 hours has actually been quite pleasing in terms of the way a lot of people thought things would go but we want to continue to discuss the elephant in the room the donkey in the room as we mentioned sunday but looking at this subject of you were made for this whatever's to come whatever the future holds we're not afraid of it because we know who holds our future first corinth second corinthians rather second corinthians chapter one verse three blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies the god of all comfort who comforted us in all our tribulation who comforts us think of that comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god so we are comforted in tribulation being comforted in tribulation we're able to comfort them also who are in trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god oh just what a beautiful beautiful sentence it says for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer and whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation paul recognizing a purpose through his comfort or through his suffering he realizes god is going to accomplish something for the believer's sake and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as your partakers of the sufferings so shall you also be also of the consolation for when we and that's just a comfort to us that if we partake in suffering there's also consolation that's joined with it for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in a god who raiseth the dead who delivered us from so great at death and doth deliver us in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ye also helping together by prayer for us so this is what's joined even with the deliverance of god you helped by praying that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf amen you may be seated as i mentioned we're going to continue on the subject of you were made for this and i'm going to start by reading again just making reference very quickly to the quote we read in 1 in a million and brother braham says the time and the hour that we're living if a person don't know which way to go what to do or how to turn you're not walking by faith anymore you're just guessing you are presuming and presume is to advance without official authority and so there's as christians we don't ever want to advance without official authority assume presume here as he says presume is to go forward to do something to act without actually having the authority to do so he says so if we haven't got the real official authority to know what god has said would take place in this hour how are we ever going to face this hour so if we're going to face this hour then god's going to give us a word and authority that we can rely upon to face it and i believe that holds true if there's going to be a challenge if there's going to be a difficulty that the bride collectively is going to face and something some trial some tribulation that we're going to have to endure for his sake then we are if it's if we need the faith to face it if it's not in the word already if there's something extra that we need then he's going to give us the real official authority to know how to face this hour and we've got to face it knowing by faith in his word the things that's supposed to be happening now the condition of the nations condition of the people the condition of the church and so forth we've got to know that and then how to walk out to face it and if you don't know how to do that you're just what we used to call kind of haphazardly just jumping in hoping it would be there hoping this and hoping that will it be but god wants us to do that he wants us to god don't want us to do that he wants us to know what he has said about this day and then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way that's the part i really want to focus on he wants us to know what he has said about this day and then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way so in order for us to go forward as believers we need to advance with official authority we need to know what god has said about something not just guesswork not just well i think it might be and could it be but we want to know exactly what god has said about something and as we mentioned on sunday this is a time of great uncertainty there's a lot of instability and we see this in politics we see this in economics we see this in our social structures that there's a lot of uncertainty and instability and with that we want to find stability we want to give meaning to things we want things to have order and we want to be able to place things in certain ways that we can understand what's taking place and this means that and this means this and this is where it's going and maybe one of the biggest things that afflicts us is the fear of the unknown and they call that actually the the fundamental fear the fear of the unknown it's the fear of to rule them all as they say the fear of their own is probably the greatest fear in it instigates anxiety and it causes us to speculate and to guess and so that may be the biggest thing that uh hangs over us this is just as humans is not knowing what's going to happen it could go this way it could go that way and as we pointed out on sunday and i'm just sharing these things in the outset with a lot of review when we join these spheres with the word by presuming as braham says it makes the fear worse because we see something happening we're not sure what's going to happen we try to make sense of it we grab this piece of the word we grab this and we try to cobble it together and try to make sense of things if god hasn't spoken on it then that can't not that cannot inspire faith if god hasn't said this is what it is and this is what it's going to be then that's not going to bring this real strong solid feeling of this is what god wants me to do and this is what's going to happen it's just to hope so and so when we join our fears with prophecy we say well brother branham said this the bible says that i wonder if this could be this and this is the direction it's going to go it's only making the uncertainty worse and there's a number of statements we could read to you again but fear is one of the worst things that the devil can put on you it's worse than disease it's worse than than debt it's worse than depression it's worse than divorce it's the worst thing that the devil could put on you you say oh what's worse than being divorced well the fear and the fallout from it what's worse than a disease the fear of it what's worse than debt the fear of it what's worse than all these things the actual fear it's one of the worst things the devil can put on you is maybe not an affliction in itself but a fear of what the affliction means a fear of what the affliction can do to you so if you can take the fear out of something then it loses its real power over you as we read in romans chapter 8 last time we are led by the spirit of god we're not led by fear we have not come under a bondage of fear and it's not fear that's leading us it's not fear that's directing us it's not fear that we act upon sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god and that's what motivates us that's what's going to compel us to do something and these are just uh catching up on some things that we had laid as part of our foundation on sunday so if there's a prophecy in scripture there's a prophecy that's given in the word of god and it speaks of hardship the prophecy of a hardship is never meant to cause us to fear the bible does not say you will go through suffering you will be afflicted many are the afflictions of the righteous and and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution it's not meant to cause fear or weakness not meant to cause you well i don't want to live godly in christ jesus if i'm going to suffer persecution and i don't want to be righteous if i'm going to suffer affliction prophecy of hardship or difficulty is meant to inspire faith not fear just as we read in john chapter 16 verse 13 it says all these things have i spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good shear i have overcome the world so jesus is saying i've told you difficult times are coming i've told you you're going to be kicked out of church and killed but i didn't tell you this so that you would be frustrated that you would be troubled in your hearts and you'd be worried and fearful but rather i told you these things that you might have peace have peace in me have peace in that i've shared these things with you beforehand have peace in the fact that i've already told you that this is what's going to happen so you can face it with boldness you can face it with confidence knowing he says even being of good cheer because i have overcome the world so there's no prophecy of hard times that should inspire fear there's no prophecy of suffering there's no prophecy of persecution that should cause us to doubt or dread or be worried about what the future holds do you believe that and i know it seems counterintuitive to our instinct of self-preservation and fight or flight that that whenever i get fearful of something i want to run away from it but jesus is saying if i tell you something is coming no matter how big it may see no matter how hard it may seem or how difficult it may seem you have no reason to fear it god's people have always suffered affliction we cannot look through any time in history and find where the people of god were not enduring afflictions they were not going through persecution they were not suffering loss there was not something that the a believer not necessarily the entire age or everyone or everyone in the church but we looked through every age and god's people have always suffered persecution they've always endured afflictions they've always had loss they've always suffered and the loss the persecution the suffering it's no evidence that god has forsaken you the fact that you would go through a difficult time is no evidence that god doesn't love you if somebody was to hate you and to spite you that's no evidence that god is angry with you trouble difficulty great loss and all those things are no evidence of god's a wrath it's no evidence of non-election it's no evidence that you're not the chosen of god as a matter of fact it can be the very affliction the suffering you're going through that people use to say how could you be of god and how could you be the chosen people as they would say about the jews how could they suffer such tremendous loss in persecution and be god's chosen people it's actually one of the things that stumbles the world is how god would let his people suffer but it's no evidence that god isn't with you in romans chapter 8 as we read last time suffering infirmities tribulation and distress and persecution and famine and poverty and death it's no sign that god has abandoned you it's no evidence that god's love isn't still upon you that his care is for you because none of those things diminish god's love if you're suffering god's love hasn't been diminished if you're going through a difficult time god's god's love hasn't been diminished it's not that god's love wanes that as long as he's loving me really passionately i have no troubles but when god gets cold on me and the love's gone out of my relationship and it's not like he loves me anymore and that's when things get rough no god's not like that he always loves you to attend he always loves you 100 and god is always loving you as much as he could possibly love you it's just our understanding of the love that wanes and and that we filter it through our own human expression of love and and i'll say this that we we know that god loves us but the only knowledge we have of love is our own love the love we've received and the love we give so we filter god's love through the love we give and the love we receive and we know our love ain't perfect we give love him perfectly we've received an imperfect love and we can just attribute that to god then well then god must be like i am when i'm mad at somebody i love i'll give him the cold shoulder god's not like that right and so these difficulties these things we go through it's no sign that god's love has waned or diminished and there's no promise in the word of god that says we will not sorrow there's no promise in the word of god that says we will not have trouble but there is a promise that good will come from him there's no promise you won't suffer there's no promise you won't sorrow there's no promise you won't go through trouble but he has promised that he'll be with us in it and he has promised us that good will come from it we read last time in the church age book how he said that god when when we go through difficulties when we go through trouble when we go through things that are very very hard as he says suffering that god does it with a purpose if he didn't have a purpose what it would result in is frustration and not peace so regardless of what we go through how difficult it is understanding that god has a purpose is what offers peace if we don't know that god has a purpose it offers frustration he says his purpose is that we after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled and then he makes a couple references in the scripture he says in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection this is god's will for us it's his will that we would suffer now i would say this to us as individuals we all are going to have some measure of suffering but if we let suffering do its work and we yield to it take it patiently we recognize it's to produce something inside of us he says this measure of suffering is that after we have suffered we'd come to a place of perfection so he has a purpose to suffering we're promised that we're going to suffer but the suffering just isn't for suffering's sake he will use suffering to perfect our character and i realize all of you are have been taught these things and understand these things but i want to just kind of bring them into view right now when there's things coming that are we're guessing that there's things coming we're worried about things that are coming we've heard statements and we've heard sermons we've heard different things tell us oh it's going to be dark it's going to be terrible it's going to be horrible and and all that may absolutely be true but all those things should not raise fear in your heart should not cause you to be anxious should not cause you to be concerned that you're going to be cast out that you're going to be forsaken that you're going to suffer some affliction that you're not going to be able to endure and make it through if there's suffering coming it's for your perfection amen there's something that you're going to have to face as an individual there's something we're going to have to face as a church if there's something we're going to have to go through as a bride then we know god has a purpose in it therefore we will not let that something loom over us as something larger than what we can handle so regardless of what the future holds he's promised us protection and he's promised us perfection and we should just claim that no matter what comes we know this is for my good no matter what comes god's gonna use it for his glory no matter what comes it's for my perfection or god's going to protect me from it i wonder there's a little bit of a high sound in the in the sound and i don't know if i'm just blowing you on i'm trying to watch if the sister's hair is going whenever we get loud but we're still working through some new equipment and still trying to get everything set up and so i just i don't know if it's a little loud but i just feel like there's a little bit of a high high-end ping or pitch there to it and there's also a popping i notice that's a lot louder now so we might have to resolve this uh through trial and error now i want to go back to a statement that we read in the beginning brother bran says he wants us to know what he has said about this day and then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way and now this is i'm gonna what we've just shared through these first um several minutes is just recapturing some of the principles and things we were speaking on on sunday and now this is this is where i had to leave off a little bit brother says he wants us to know what he has said about this day and then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way so what he has said about this day we know it will be that way therefore we can meet this day with faith if he says tomorrow is going to be cold then we can meet it with a coat he says tomorrow's going to be raining we can meet it with a we can meet it with an umbrella why he said so so if we know what he has said about the future then we can meet it with faith knowing that it's going to be exactly the way he said it would be and so there's the the specter of persecution or the possibility of a squeeze can hang over us like a cloud and it's like a looming darkness that you just you never know when the government's going to show up with with guns and you never know when the government's going to show up with the lock and you never know when they're going to kick you out of your church you never know where there's going to be locks placed on the door you never know when it's going to be the last time they're going to be able to meet and when are they going to go door to door asking if you believe the message and if you do they're going to put you in a cattle car and ship you up to alaska and there's a lot of ways that things can be presented to us where we're always wondering i wonder if this administration is going to be the one that finally outlaws the message and there's always and i maybe i'm putting in a way that may seem comical or extreme but this is a this is a language that's sometimes used about what we believe and about what brother branham said and that one day we're going to face this we have to look down the barrel of a gun and we're going to have to stand for our faith and it could be it can always have this cloud kind of hanging over us that until that time comes and when that time comes that's when things are going to really start to happen and there's a danger to that number one you're really really afraid of that time so fear is always operating in the background or you've kind of got slack until that time comes and i imagine there's a lot of people that are waiting until the knocks on the door do you believe the message and they're like oh this is our chance honey turn the tv off this is our chance yes yes i believe the message like uh no sorry you don't know what the message is next door right because they're just they're just waiting until things get difficult things get hard and that's what happens sometimes coronavirus comes around covet 19 hits and people are oh no is this the plague is this the disease people are starting to find out where they can go to church then they find out all the church doors are closed people move across country trying to find god then why because something starts happening oh i guess now is the time to get serious so there's a way these things can impact us in the sense that causes some people just to slack off until things get really hot and heavy till the squeeze comes to things start happening and that's when we're all going to get serious that's when all of our kids are going to get saved or they say wow i'm always fearful they're always looking around the corner they're always wondering what's next and really you don't want to live in either of those realms you want to know what god has said about this day and then have faith to meet it and so it begs the question has god prophesied specific persecution or even a specific measure of tribulation for the bride has god prophesied it and if there's prophecies pertaining to persecution of the bride there's prophecies pertaining to difficulty that the bride's going to have to go through does your understanding of the prophecy inspire fear or does it inspire faith so what if we see it and we read and say well brother branham said here and the message says this there and the bible says this there now once we've read it and we process it does it bring a faith in our hearts to believe that god has provision that god's going to see us through it or does it cost fear and if it's causing fear i would suggest there's a misunderstanding somewhere because god would not say thus saith the lord you're going to go through persecution and then you received the revelation of the persecution and it inspired fear and inspired dread and inspire worry something would be missing somewhere then if there is a prophecy that pertains to these things then the question is are we taking the whole word into consideration yes it may say this here but what else has the word said maybe maybe there's more to what was said and it's just these sound bites or these phrases that we have and i call them message myths where it's we're quoting things and we say brother branham said you're like are you sure he ever said that because i've been looking for 30 years now and i've never found it and then the person oh no i'm telling you right now brother bam said say well here's my laptop i always travel with my 17-inch xps let's open this thing up let's bang away on these keys and let's find where brother branham said it and you can't find it like well i know it's in there somewhere like where you're going to have to use the bible code to find it you have to read it this way and then you have to read it this way and so there's sometimes we've just built this mythology around the message of these things that brother man said and he never did say it or you read it so far and you stop did you know brother brown said you should never send your kids to sunday school he said it that is almost verbatim he said you should never send your kids to sunday school he said you should take them amen and so if i left off on the first part we could rally against a campaign against sunday school right because you leave some of it off so you want to take the whole word into consideration without your private interpretation your own personal interpretation of it in revelation chapter 3 verse 10 it says this in the admonishment to the philadelphia age because thou has kept the word of my patience i will also keep thee from the hour of temptation we shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth so this we could we look at this scripture and the scripture saying without any uh qualification that there will come a temptation upon the earth that will try everyone on it there's going to be a time when there's going to be a temptation that comes upon the earth and is going to try all them that are upon the earth god has said it will happen so as we face this as we look at this scripture and say there's going to be a temptation come upon the earth an hour of temptation that will come upon all the earth to try them that dwell upon the earth if you're dwelling upon the earth there's going to come an hour of temptation you know try everyone that's on the earth god said it would be there but then he also says in this very scripture that he promised to keep thee from the hour of temptation so when you read it he's actually saying i'll keep you from that hour not even necessarily in the hour or through the hour he will keep you from the hour so you can read a statement says oh everyone that dwells upon the earth their flesh is going to be eaten by birds and you just develop this real horrific scene of tribulation not take into consideration that the bible has already said the bride is gone before that happens so why should you fear about it why should you be afraid of tribulation why should you be afraid of the sights and things that are gonna be coming up on the earth after the bride's gone so the devil tries to cause confusion cause things to blend in mesh things into our uh the day we're living in to try to keep us under this suspense that at any moment we're going to seal our testimony with our own blood in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 13 we referenced it last time there hath no temptation taken you but such is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it this is the promise we should all be very familiar with that there's no temptation that you have been challenged with that you'll be tested with that another person hasn't been tested with before there's nothing unique to your temptation to where it hasn't been endured already there's no temptation such confronts you but such as is common to man and then we're so thankful for the faithfulness of god who will not suffer you to endure a temptation that you're not able to endure he will not suffer you to go through a temptation that you're not able to bear but will with the temptation every temptation has something special built within it and that's a way to escape it and the way of escape is how you're able to bear it not just getting used to it and and learning and learning how to live with it but rather a way to escape it so that you may be able to bear it now i want to read a lengthy statement from the message look away to jesus and those scriptures revelations three and first corinthians 10 to me speak to how that god has promised that there is there are temptations there are sufferings there are difficulties but there's more to the promise than just the fact that you're going to suffer there's perfection that comes with it paul said the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us so it's not just suffering for suffering's sake but there's something that comes out of it but then there's also another part of the word where so you could say well there's the perfection that comes from suffering all of us as individuals are subject to suffering at any time and and then there's but then on another level if there's a prophecy that looms large over us we feel like at any moment we're all going to be undergoing some difficulty some pressure a persecution or a squeeze then there's a there's other parts to those prophecies that speak to the perfection or the protection so we don't get so enamored with the fact that these things are coming these things are coming but what has god said about it what's the full picture what's the full scope and it's in the message look away to jesus that we find some of the most familiar statements when it comes to persecution when it comes to suffering as it relates to the bride specifically and brother branham's ministry and there's a few statements i've left off thinking maybe we'll get to him in another point but brother bam says this the third pull has now been vindicated he says and i'm sure you all know what it is but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything could be done so the third pull and it's remarkable if you listen to it i was listening to it again here recently whether it says the third poll has been vindicated and i'm sure you all know what it is not one amen you can hear on the tape everybody's like we do huh what we know what it is because it's still to most of them they weren't zeroing in on what it was because the third pool's now been vindicated i'm sure you all know what it is he says but it'll not be used in a great way so now if you think about that he's saying it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up so the third pull now is is where the third pole we know it is thoroughly vindicated we know what it is he says but now it's not going to be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does so now we've in our minds think third pull is not going to be used in a great way until something happens he says the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything could be done so he's saying there's always going to be some impersonation there's always going to be some fanaticism or something that can be in says but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down and this is where we get how many here are familiar with the term the squeeze this is where it comes from this statement right here when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you have seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power so he's referring to the temporary manifestations of the third pool and brother brahms looking at it from the standpoint we've seen temporary manifestations of it it's not going to be used in a great way until something else happens and then when that happens you'll see it manifested in its fullness it says now i'll continue in evangelism just as i was commissioned first i must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand so we have the word we know what what to look for and how to stand so there's something that's been given to us already what to look for and how to stand and he says in paragraph 42 and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified the first pool so has the second been identified and if you'll think real closely you who are spiritual as the bible said here's to him that has wisdom the third is properly identified we know where it is so the third pool is here so there's no ambiguity of whether or not it's coming whether or not it's manifested whether or not it's here he said it is here thoroughly vindicated it's now here he says i it is so sacred that i mustn't say much about it so that informs us that brother adam's description and language he uses he's going to be reserved and sharing it there's more he would want to say but he can't say too much i mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning this say nothing of it you remember that years ago and he's referring to the tent vision as we call it the vision with the three pulls in it he says it speaks for itself i've tried to explain the others and i made a mistake he says this will be the thing that to my opinion i don't say the lord tells me this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away so if you follow kind of the these bread crumbs as he's placing it in there the third poll has been vindicated properly identified and it's here he says i can't say too much about it but i believe this is going to be what causes rapture and faith i'd like to say more but this is going to be what causes the bride to be translated what the third poll so he says we have to wait here just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes and i really honestly don't know exactly what he's referring to there but he's looking at something and he uses the language which is very very general maybe in some ways cryptic that we got to wait here just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then he says the time comes but it's thoroughly identified now notice what he says there's coming a time in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beast had before which was pagan rome when it became papal rome so pagan roman papal rome are the same spirit this that this nation will do that so this nation is going to raise up and exercise all the power that the beast had he says revelation 13 plainly explains it the lamb came upon out of the earth the other beasts come up out of the water thickness in multitudes of people this lamb come up where there was no people a lamb represents religion he says and remember it spoke like the lamb it was a lamb then after a while it received power and spoke like a dragon and exercised all the power of the dragon had before him and the dragon is rome always so now we're connecting all this together and i realize i like being able to do this maybe on a wednesday night because you're it's maybe more of a teaching time but brother branham is saying talking about the third pull thoroughly identified thoroughly vindicated it's here now he's looking at something coming and his in his way he sees it he even says in my mind this will be the thing that will cause the rapture of the church the third pool will be he's looking at prophecy in the scripture that's coming he said do you realize that america is going to raise up and she's going to fulfill revelations 13 and she's going to exercise all the power of the beast and this is going to be papal rome even pagan rome and it's going to be speaking like a dragon exercising all the power that the dragon had before and the dragon is the rome always and so he's trying to get us to think about this thing that's coming in light of the third pull that's been given and the squeeze of the tightening the persecution that's coming he says don't you see the roman denomination a marked protestant denomination an image unto the beast making a power that'll force all protestants like a union says you'll have to be in this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship he says well it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification and now on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all of that all together so you're going to be pushed out of their club so to speak you're not going to be able to fellowship with them or preach for them and and have a and have a you know be organized together and do things jointly why because you're not part of their system now this has been happening for over 40 years where men of god have taken a stand for the message of the hour and they've had to leave their denomination they were part of upc they were part of this organization this has been happening around the world where men in churches have stood for the message of the hour and because they did they were put out of their organization they could no longer have fellowship their fellowship card was taken and tore up there's actually literal fellowship cards and so he says that's exactly because they won't be able to do it now i look at that and realize maybe it's unclear what he's referring to but they won't be able to make the elect join their denomination they won't be able to make the elect join their organization their way of seeing things and so they're not going to be able to make you do that so you're going to be cut out he says it's tightening and when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you were pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then it'll be absolutely to the total loss but it'll be for the bride and the church the church is the one that goes to tribulation but the bride's the one that goes into rapture so there's something in this third pool where brother i'm going to preach his souls in prison now and say could it be that it's to the eternally lost but we know there's something in it for the bride there's something in it for the lost there's something in it for the bride and there's something in it for the church so it's in these several paragraphs that we have that we have this understanding that brother brahma's teaching that the third poll is here it's properly identified as thoroughly vindicated that it will not manifest in its entirety or in its fullness until it comes time for the squeeze to come or this tightening he says we can see it now it's already happening revelations 13 come into existence the roman denomination this this dragon speaking this america becoming like this beast to enforce this religious persecution and he says this press comes when that time comes oppressed a place where you're pressed out he says watch the third pull then what i'm fixing to tell you you watch then what i'm fixing to tell you now i've read it to you so i'd be foolish to try to tell you he didn't say that and and it's in plain english for us to read and understand that brother man's definitely laying these things out there that gets our attention and it's these statements statements earlier in the year in christ is the mystery of god revealed in different places where brother brahm is definitely pointing out that he has this understanding that the denominations are wanting to do something with their organization the world council churches has an agenda it has something it's trying to do and it's going to try to force everyone who names christ and everyone to join their league and if you don't join it there's going to be consequences for it that even though these prophecies and these statements by brother branham are very clear he didn't prophesy a persecution he didn't prophesy a tightening or press or the squeeze to cause us to despair the truth of this was never meant for us to be fearful it's never meant for us to chew our nails it was never meant for us to speculate oh when is the door is going to be shut and when are we no longer going to be at fellowship when is this going to happen he didn't prophesy these things to us to create a dark cloud or a shadow that always kind of follows us as a church and we never know when we never know when he told us these things because there's something to it amen and it's in these prophecies and i want to point this very very narrow part out and go into more later he prophesied this that we might gain a greater confidence he prophesied this so there would be something that we could receive in this in the totality of it not just there's going to be a squeeze there's going to be a persecution there's going to be a tightening there's going to be a world council churches if you don't join it they're going to shut your church doors not that we would all sit around say i guess that's going to happen one day but rather take the totality of it and recognize there's a promise in this that if i attach myself to this completely diminishes there's a promise that he's giving us he's pointing us to things he says i can't say too much but the third pull's here it's thoroughly identified properly vindicated look there's going to be things coming but this is just watch what i'm fixing to tell you in the next few minutes he shared these things as a foundational point to the sermon looking away to jesus he shared these things as a foundational point to this he's saying i want you before i preach this i want you to consider these things so these things were foundational you follow me they're a starting point not a conclusion so he wasn't he wasn't leading us to this place where boom that's it this is where we are all right let's wait for the squeeze let's wait for the persecution let's wait till we see all these things coming together and then when it does we can start looking around for the third point he's saying it's here properly identified thoroughly vindicated and so he's saying these things as a foundation to look away to jesus because in this very passage here and i don't think i brought it with me but he's saying look i i don't know i may be building a platform and he starts speculating to certain things he says but i know this this message will introduce jesus christ and it has it absolutely has so it's he's saying look away to jesus he said i can't say too much about this i don't want to say too much but he's laying these things out there and he definitely says there's going to be a titan there's going to be a squeeze there's going to be persecution the the america is going to raise up like a lamb that becomes this beast becomes this dragon he says but there's something else in this i'm saying but but there's something else in this that we need to look to because that was foundational it wasn't the conclusion it was the start and so the focus should be on the pull that keeps the focus should be on the pool that protects the elect when that time comes let's not lose sight of what keeps don't lose sight of what what protects because if we don't know what that time looks like because we don't have thus saith the lord it's going to be this way and if we're not exactly sure how these things are involved let's not lose sight of jesus not lose sight of the third poll not lose sight of of what the keeping powers the protection power is for when that time comes because these the reference each one of these references we read here and then some in other some places as well the reference to the squeeze of the tightening of the persecution it's in the context of the third pool so as brother branham brings up revelations 13 as he brings up the world council of churches and the pentecostals impersonating anything and the power of the beast and all these things to bring everything into union it's not just in relation to but it's an opposition against the third pool so it's not just these things are all in there at the same time it you have to recognize that satan is against this message he's against this truth he hates this third pool because god has so hid it from him perfectly it's been it's been expressed and manifested in such a way where satan could not destroy it he could not stop it it came and it's manifested and it's having an impact even to this time and satan cannot stop it so he tries to cause confusion about it and so the the squeeze the tightening the persecution is not just in the context of the third pool but those things are in opposition against the third pool now in the message anointed ones at the end time brother branham says this the first bull healing second paul prophesying and we and we could get into the the specifics of that but i i'm sure you know these things he says third pool the open of the word the mysteries revealed prior to december 29 1963 brother branham had a lot of questions about the third pull could it be we don't know we're not sure even in early november he was saying i don't know i'm not sure could it be but after that fifth and final vindication of the third pool when brother branham preaches look away to jesus from this moment on he never has another question about the third pull why thoroughly vindicated properly identified it is here so he never questions it anymore but you find statements like this the few times he makes reference to it he's very certain about what it is the third poll the opening of the word the mysteries revealed that's what the third poll was the open of the word the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word it's so important for us to understand that this is what the third pull is the third pull is not circumstantial instances where something operates in your life and oh we're looking to the third pool and the third pool is going to be this the third pool is going to be bad the third pool was the open of the word the third pulls the seventh seal opening the third poll is revealing christ the third pose to open the seals it reveals the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word and that's only given to a special class of people and so that's what the third pull is when he preaches the first seal he said there's coming seven mysterious thunders there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders it's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through these seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith so the third pull is the open of the seven seals which is the revealing of the seven thunders he says i believe which is what the seven thunders reveal it's they're all connected together he says i believe that this these seven thunders are revealed to get the bride together for rapturing faith so this is why brother branham says i believe this will be the thing that will start the rapture in faith for the going away because it's the revealing of the seven seals it reveals the hidden truth that's been still in the word and brother man says this is what's going to get the bride together for rapturing faith so this is we're just connecting these dots now the third pool is the opening of the word to give the bride rapturing faith now brother bam says in the message shalom and this is just two weeks within two weeks of this statement from look away to jesus he says now i think it'll lay just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on he says i i think this is him saying i think it may just lay dormant for a little while so you may notice things are a little different i'm not talking about sin now but i may just take a step back he wasn't sure just how things would unfold until that great hour of persecution comes on it'll speak it'll be manifested will the brother bram say about the rapture god just speaks and the rapture will go it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly and i think just wait just see what does now there's something to these five temporary manifestations of the third pull he says these five straight signs without failure what they were applicable to what they referenced what they involved there was something to those things but it shouldn't create this idea in our mind that the third pull is just like that where it's just waiting for some day for it to happen in your living room waiting for some day to happen when you're on the boat waiting for some day to happen when you're out hunting there's more to this third pool it is the open of the seven seals it is the revealing of jesus christ because he is those seals the opening of all seven seals not just making clear the baggie where you know the candy bag is still sealed but you can see what's in it no it's opened what's in it is ours it's unfolding it's been open so he says now it's it's gonna it may lay dormant until that great hour persecution comes on then he says this in the very next week in his unfailing words of promise others i've tried to explain say how it was done this can't be explained what the third he said it can't be explained just wait it'll not be an operation so perfectly now wait till that council of churches brings on that persecution that's when it'll happen now let's just all agree that the way brother branham is saying this we get the sense that the third pool is going to going to lay dormant for a while this third pool of brother brown's ministry is is just gonna go away and fade maybe go off the scene with brother branham and everyone's waiting until an event takes place and then when this takes place the third pool comes back and if you read it it's almost this you get the sense that that's how brother brahms explaining it it's gonna it's gonna be lay dormant for a while till the great hour of persecution comes on wait till that council churches brings on this persecution that's when it'll happen but what will happen what is he referring to he's referring to the translation of the bride he says i believe the third pull what you've seen manifested temporarily is one day going to be manifest in the fullness of its power he goes and i believe that's what's going to start the rapture in faith for the going away the third pull is what brings rapturing faith for going away and he's saying now it may seem like it's laying dormant and it and it may not it may not be doing things that you expect it to do but the third pool is the revealing of christ the revealing of christ is what gives the bride rapturing faith he says wait till that council churches brings on that persecution that's when it will happen what is it the translation of the bride amen when our bodies are changed to meet the lord in the air and so much of this if you go and listen to the sermons in the summer of 64 you find that brother branham brings great clarity to these things because when he preaches feasts of the trumpets everything that he was looking to happen in a physical realm completely changes and he realized and he makes this great point to us that this persecution this titan in this squeeze isn't a physical persecution but it's spiritual persecution it's a pressure that we feel even as message believers from other people that claim to be the believe the message why because you see the open of the word because you're not you're not you're not doing the things that they think you should be doing you're not expressing things the way you think you should be expressing listen don't be ashamed to just stick with god's word stay with god's word and he said these signs shall follow them that believe stay in the channel of the original gospel stay with exactly what he said and don't be pulled into fanaticism by what men are saying by what men are doing that's how you get baptized into 1977 right none of you were baptized in 1977 i'm sure but there's so much fear created in 1976 about 1977 it's all going to be over that someone prophesied yea saith the lord you know we're just but a few hours from 1977 and hundreds of people were baptized unto 1977. now there's just no scriptural basis for it what's the baptism for it's an outward sign that you believe your sins have been remitted right you're you're it's something you do in obedience to the word of god and listen let me say this if you have been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you know that you've been sealed by the holy ghost you never really ever need to be rebaptized what would cause you to be baptized fear because if you were baptized and sealed it worked it did what was supposed to do being re-baptized can't do any more for you so i would much rather just address the fear than create confusion by having you be rebaptized because then people think re-baptism is just a solvent that works that's what you do whenever you backslide whenever something goes wrong you just be re-baptized you don't need to be re-baptized when you go through difficulty you shouldn't be re-baptized every time there's a revival right and that's what happens when there's fanaticism and there's emotion and things get stirred up and people like oh let me get in the water stay steady stay in the word of god do you have the holy ghost you know you've been said yes then stand on your ground amen don't be pulled into fanaticism don't be drawn into something carnal but the random says this in question and answers part three and the seven seals was only revealing what they had left off back there and it opened up what they had left off what luther left what wesley left and all the reformers and pentecostals and down to the present time now the next thing left is the translation of the church the next thing isn't persecution the next thing isn't suffering now i'm not saying there won't be persecution right i'm not saying there won't be suffering but brother branham was not saying that pers physical persecution and being put into you know us being shuttled off to alaska is what happens next that's not what's going to happen next he says the next thing is left is the translation of the church and then he goes through the whole order the return of moses and elijah the millennium reign upon the earth with the bride and bridegroom in the groom for a thousand years and then the judgment bar then a total annihilation of sin he just tells us what's next so is he giving you faith to face the hour amen what's next translation that's what i need faith for is a translation brotherhood says in the first seal the seven thunders of revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for the great translation faith it says in the first seal this is what i believe will give the seven thunders will be revealed to get the bride together for rapturing faith so he says the seven thunders of revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for the great translation faith what does it the third pull does it not the squeeze the third pull not the persecution the third pull persecution and suffering without the third pull wouldn't do us any good would it so the focus is on the word just as we read before in john chapter 7 verse 30 here he is there's a conspiracy to murder him they want to murder him they would love to get their hands on him says then they sought to take him so they're wanting to do it but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come what controlled the word controlled the word is what determined the destiny of christ the word is what determined when he would be crucified the word is what determined it nothing else not the meanness of man not the politics not the persecution it's all stayed back it was all withheld according to the prophecy and that's what we need to be rooted in is what the word says not what our minds drift off to what the word has said about it not what we're fearful of not the the mythology that develops where we get in our minds it's got to be a particular way lay aside all the private interpretation lay down all the speculation lay down all all the fanaticism and stay with the word of god now i'm going to i have a lengthy statement i want to read from the church age book in the philadelphian age brother braham is dealing with the scripture revelations chapter 3 verse 10 it says it goes on to say to them because you have taken my word and i lived it and lived it and thereby become patient i will keep you from the hour of temptation we shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now here again we see the overlapping of two ages for this promise has to do with the end of the gentile period which culminates in the great tribulation so this is where i'm saying that there's something spoken in philadelphia that's actually applicable to the end of laodicea because he's looking at something that the culmination or the end of the gentile age which is the great tribulation i will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth this verse is not a declaration that the church will go into and through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said that but it said i will keep thee from the hour of temptation now catch this part this to me is so important this temptation is exactly like the temptation in eden it'll be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to god's commanded word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and life-giving as to fool the world only the very elect will not be fooled so you're not going to be fooled by it so according to matthew 24 24 we are not in fear that the elect will be deceived but there is a great power that's going to come that's going to deceive people so he explains it this way only the elect will not be fooled the temptation will come as follows so the great hour of temptation comes as follows the ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect denominate domination of this council little groups will lose charters privileges until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local ministerial association approves in many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become chaplains in the armed services and hospitals etc it is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical groups and these things are all true as this pressure increases and it will it'll be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they will feel it is better to serve god publicly in the framework of this organization than to serve god at all publicly he says but they air but remember only the very elect will not be fooled so all this could be happening but the elect's not fooled now i know this starts ratcheting up the pressure a little bit like oh my goodness what is this going to mean for all of us then are we ever going to be able to rent a building are we ever going to be able to find a place to worship what's going to happen if joe biden wants if he becomes the president in this they do all pass all these tax laws and our donations are no longer tax deductible would you stop giving because of that does the bible say tithe because it works out in your tax return at the end of the year no but there's a lot of people who will stop a lot of churches that probably would fold if they took away property tax exemption took away certain tax uh benefits to churches and they say well look listen just to make it easy if you're donating to a church that is a of a recognizable organization then your taxes can be deducted and all your donations can be deducted all these things and they may go that way and if it happens it's money amen right it's just money and yes it makes it harder but who's going to be fooled by it who's going to give in well i know we've been an independent baptist all the baptist church all these years and i know we've been an independent pentecostal church but unless we join a federation we can't get property tax exemption unless we join a federation we can't have your deductions be tax deductible anymore and i know you'll all stop tithing if we don't so in order for us to survive we're going to have to join with an organization but you know what we're just doing it we might change a little bit of things on the website that we believe in the trinity and you might find little things different but we're just doing this because we can be an example in the community we can do this and maybe there's people that give in because of that but the elect won't be fooled right they say oh we're gonna have to go it alone well that's fine you know we were actually told beforehand this would happen but notice this he says to continuing but they air to believe the devil's lie is to serve satan even though you may want to call him jehovah but the elect will not be deceived notice the furthermore furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image erected to the beast the saints will be gone in the rapture i'm not worried about revelations 13. i'm not i've heard revelations 18 4. i'm becoming the new jerusalem at the end of the book i i've heard the voice of revelations 18 4. i've gone to him who holds the book in revelations 10 that there's something different that i'm fellowshipping in so when brother brenham's talking and look away to jesus that america will come to a place where she will exercise all the power of the beast and he's telling us about this image erected to the beast and the fulfillment of revelations 13. he's saying not only will the elect be kept but listen once it gets to that point the bride is already gone in the rapture you're already gone yes he'll keep you in the hour of temptation but he's also going to keep you from this hour of temptation there's certain things in the scripture we read about and like but the bible says this is going to happen and the bible says this is going to happen and brother bram said this is going to happen and brother brahm said and i'm just maybe getting into another area here brother man says that the plagues are going to come upon the earth and these plagues are going to be so horrendous and so terrible that only those who have the holy ghost are going to be kept from it you're familiar with anybody raise their hand where brother bram says those things and you do you realize that in the very scriptures where the bible is talking about these things coming upon the earth that the reason why you're exempt from it it's not just because you have the holy ghost but because all those who have the holy ghost have gone to the marriage supper of the lamb it's like how come i didn't see that that's the reason why you don't have to worry about if you have the holy ghost and that's why if there's a plague if there's a disease whether it be covet 19 or covet 20 or whatever's next they said listen i'm not afraid of this as if this is some kind of litmus test as to whether or not i'm a believer you know how i know a believer i believe god's word i believe what he said in this hour i've seen i've seen him manifested in this day that's the litmus test is i believe his word i say amen to the word not whether or not i succumb to some disease whether or not my life is free from trial whether or not my wife leaves me whether those things aren't the evidence god has given us one evidence you amen the word of god for this day you recognize the word that's been revealed in this day and all these things that the devil tries to build to create this fear and this paranoia i say we stay with the word of god and not tend to paranoia tend to fanaticism very things that we could find in the scripture that speak about these things being poured out it actually says that these things have come upon the people but the bride has been called away to the marriage supper of the lamb and that's why we that's why we're exempt from it all those that have the holy ghost are somewhere else furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image erected to the beast in other words what happens and look away to jesus brother abraham says what's coming when that time comes he says not only is the bride going to be kept she'll be gone in the rapture amen that's the third pool that's what that's what we're believing in i'd like to touch on it more in greater detail maybe the sunday you just keep praying you just keep asking god to meet your spiritual needs but the death that the the last plague that strikes the church is spiritual death amen if there's a plague that's going to take physical life that strikes the whole world you're gone right but the battle you overcome in the plague you defeat is spiritual death because in the end it's only the bride that's spiritually alive so it's a spiritual plague it's a spiritual battle thank god for the opening of the word to give us life as paul said as we read in second corinthians chapter one verses eight to ten he says for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia this is when we read from timothy before he says yeah we've had some difficulty this is it and we were pressed out of measure this is paul's word we are pressed out of measure thereby says when that press comes to a place to where you're pressed out pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead now why did paul believe that because he knew what god where he said he had to go paul knew that he had to get to rome paul knew there was a place that he was going paul knew that he was on an ordained path he had thus saith the lord he knew he had to get there and if something was going to intervene in the interim he's like well even if i die he's got to raise me up again so it wasn't that death had this such a great power over him he's like oh no if i die what's going to happen he's like if i die god has to raise me from the dead now that's paul's testimony and paul was going to be he was martyred and then those early believers they faced martyrdom and that's what they were anointed to do but we have not been called to martyrdom we have not been called to have to face death and give our lives as an oxen and be that sacrifice that would give our lives for what we believe though some may be called to do it that's not the spirit on this age that's not what the bride collective is going to face but verse 10 then we can take to heart about god who did who delivered us from so great at death so paul says i trusted in the god and now he testifies who delivered us from so great to death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us it's a god who hath delivered a god who doth deliver and a god who will yet deliver us death has no hold over the believer the the specter of death the threat of death the threat of some sort of suffering and calamity or famine or trial or hurt or persecution or being left forsaken none of that holds any power of the believer because even death itself has lost its power over you because he delivers that's why i can say you're made for this no matter what it is god has spoken something over you and you can take it god bless you let's stand if the lord would will may perhaps look further into some of these things but do you do you know some peace like a river joy like a fountain kfc if our heads bowed let's just go to the lord in prayer i i know it's a wednesday night and there's [Music] school in the morning and work and so many different demands on our time so much pressure if there's any way we can be of help to you let us know even if it's just through prayer there's a family who a sister just experienced a car accident we pray that god would be with her this request for brother michael's niece asking god just to be merciful in that need sister ruth brother elias god would have mercy on him we believe that's why we pray we're not praying praying in a way of just kind of hoping we know our prayers hit the target and we commit it to god if you have a need tonight you just bring your need before the lord even in your heart and in your prayers our gracious heavenly father lord as we stand before you tonight having taken this journey into the word i pray that you would bring the proper balance to these things and lord that if there be a an emphasis that you would desire may you grant it i realized for me as a minister i could read things and study things uh things be quickened to me and i in things i've experienced an advantage point that i have and i can share it from that vantage point but lord i i'm not trying to share my view that they would see it my way but what i want to share the word as you have said it so they could see it your way and lord i pray that you would help just take these things and melt them together and make them one and fuse them to realize that father we would be doing you a disservice to say ah there's no persecution ah there's no tightening there's no squeeze as brother brown said there was he said there would be something and lord we wouldn't want to be completely dismissive of it likewise lord we don't want to be dismissive of what it was he was pointing us to when he was talking about these things that you are here revealing yourself you're making yourself known so father i pray that above all you would help us to tie ourselves to this absolute join ourselves to the word feed on this message yield to the holy spirit take into our bosom these great truths in this hour for lord they are not leading us to a grave but they're leading us to a change and that's my prayer father that you would lead us to a meeting in the air by this word that we're feeding on recognizing that this translation of the bride it's this word that's in us this body is going to form around the word that's already in us it's already been activated so father i pray that this would help settle us it helps give us a stronger resolve to face the difficulties that are ahead that we would not be quick to speculate about what's to come lord the bible even says it's a time and everyone's like oh peace safety everything's great everything's wonderful and then sudden destruction comes [Music] could it be lord that we're going to enter into a season where everyone thinks that everything's wonderful people slack off and they get comfortable the economic continue well the social unrest is kind of just finds its balance and the instigators and the agitators are out of view and everything just kind of gets back to normal again and the world's economy stabilized and the whole world just seems to enter into a peaceable season [Music] lord how foolish we would be as your bride to get complacent then and lord if we would be foolish to get complacent because things get peaceful lord we be foolish now to wait for things to get difficult and hard to get serious about this message may we now lord be more sincere may we now father want to do better i pray lord you to help us to do so i ask that you'd comfort the people in this church and their loved ones and their family comfort our sister churches the believers lord around the world who suffer great affliction brothers in jail in china ministers imprisoned in iran doors closing in turkey fearful things happen in egypt threats in france lord we realize that very quickly message believers could come under a microscope of some terrorist become the subject of some hate law find ourselves on the wrong side of some legislation we realize that's always possible lord may we not wait till the time when the bible's taken out of our hand if it would be lord may we not wait for the time that a lock would be placed on the door to try to get serious because could it be lord before it comes to that the bride is already gone in a rapture so i pray lord you'd guess help us to do those things which are proper in your sight those things that are pleasing lord and comfort comfort lord comfort the people i ask in the name of the lord jesus christ amen peace
