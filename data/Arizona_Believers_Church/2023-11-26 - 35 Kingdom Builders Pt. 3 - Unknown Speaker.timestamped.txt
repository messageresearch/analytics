[0:00] Lord willing this morning we'll wrap up
[0:02] um at least in titling uh the series on
[0:05] the kingdom as we've been looking at
[0:07] Heaven's mystery Earth's glory and I'd
[0:10] like to just use the title this morning
[0:12] is Kingdom Builders and this is part
[0:13] three I think this is a wonderful place
[0:15] just to transition to some other things
[0:17] that the Lord's been dealing with me on
[0:19] and uh wanted to kind of be not
[0:22] climactic necessarily but kind of some
[0:24] summing up some things and just uh
[0:26] wrapping up a lot of different thoughts
[0:27] that we've been laying out through these
[0:28] several services
[0:30] and over the last several um services
[0:33] that we've had together on this subject
[0:34] we've been looking at how the the Earth
[0:36] will be full of the knowledge of the
[0:37] Lord and we know that that has
[0:39] application in the future home but then
[0:41] we begin to see by the scripture there's
[0:43] this remarkable uh application of these
[0:46] scriptures uh to the Millennium and this
[0:49] time of the reign of Christ with his
[0:50] bride for a thousand years on Earth and
[0:53] we were using how that in the Millennium
[0:56] the things that will take place in the
[0:57] Millennium before the Earth is
[0:58] completely renovated by by fire baptism
[1:01] is a type of the spirit in us now
[1:04] indwelling Us and how that we being in
[1:07] the spirit can be filled with wisdom and
[1:09] knowledge and understanding and
[1:11] Revelation and emphasizing the
[1:13] importance of understanding and
[1:15] Revelation and so I'd like to just pick
[1:17] up right there on Revelation and maybe
[1:19] just seed for the next few minutes some
[1:21] other things that we've been mentioning
[1:22] through the last service so kind of all
[1:24] get on the same page and then we'll just
[1:26] try to wrap this up with a nice big bow
[1:28] on it just in time for the holiday
[1:31] season and in Matthew 16: 18 Christ had
[1:35] asked them uh who do men say that I am
[1:37] and there was a lot of speculation as to
[1:39] who Christ was and some surmised he was
[1:41] different prophets a great man a great
[1:44] teacher and then when he ask the
[1:46] question very pointedly well who do you
[1:48] say that I am Peter in responding Thou
[1:50] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:53] and Jesus is pointing out that he says
[1:55] well Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this
[1:57] to you you didn't figure this out you
[1:59] didn't hear it from some somebody else
[2:00] we could even say that he didn't learn
[2:03] it even from demons as they were cast
[2:05] out who might have exclaimed oh you're
[2:07] the the Messiah or the Christ he this
[2:09] was not something he took away
[2:11] externally but something that had been
[2:13] quickened inside of him and the father
[2:15] had revealed it to him and Jesus's
[2:18] response to that Dynamic it's such an
[2:20] incredible statement he says and I say
[2:22] also unto thee that thou art Peter this
[2:25] and that's speaking of a rock that he
[2:27] himself was going to be a rock that by
[2:29] revelation he became a building material
[2:31] he became a part of a foundation and
[2:34] Upon This Rock which is revelation I
[2:36] will build my church and the Gates of
[2:38] Hell shall not Prevail against it there
[2:42] is nothing of of such prevailing power
[2:45] as Revelation not exclamation but
[2:48] Revelation there is nothing as much as
[2:51] prevailing power it's the most powerful
[2:52] thing there is is revelation it's what
[2:54] we ought to call upon the Lord for more
[2:56] than anything is revelation and so this
[2:59] is what Jesus is saying is everything I
[3:02] will build my church on Revelation so
[3:05] that tells us the foundation is the
[3:07] revelation of Jesus Christ and it's
[3:09] Jesus Christ that's doing the building
[3:11] so it's the building of Jesus Christ and
[3:13] he uses Revelation to lay the foundation
[3:16] and he's going to use Revelation to lift
[3:17] the structure up and all hell is against
[3:21] Revelation and all hell is against this
[3:24] Revelation he says I I build Upon This
[3:25] Rock I'll build my church and I'm going
[3:26] to give you the keys of the kingdom and
[3:29] so hell is against the knowledge to open
[3:32] up the power of the
[3:34] Kingdom that's what the devil wants to
[3:36] confuse and interrupt if he could just
[3:38] keep you from getting Revelation true
[3:40] Revelation which brother says the
[3:42] importance of true Revelation in a
[3:44] believer's life and I'm just kind of
[3:45] paraphrasing cannot be over
[3:47] overemphasized the importance of true
[3:49] Revelation in a believer's life that so
[3:52] it's something that's very very
[3:54] important to us and brother Bram writes
[3:57] that the true Revelation is God in
[3:59] interpreting his own word by vindicating
[4:02] what is Promised so there's a you can't
[4:05] say I got a revelation I got a
[4:06] revelation but it has to be God a true
[4:08] Revelation is God interpreting has to be
[4:10] the word interpreted by Vindication and
[4:13] the manifestation is the Vindication and
[4:16] you miss it without
[4:17] Revelation right you might be on a
[4:19] spiritual vacation which will be
[4:21] followed by a lot of lamentation if you
[4:24] don't get the Revelation and so true
[4:26] Revelation is God interpreting his word
[4:28] by vindicating what is promised and we
[4:31] read the statement from Satan's Eden and
[4:34] brother brandham says I heard brother
[4:35] Bram brother Neville say this morning
[4:37] someone might have been asking him why I
[4:40] why why didn't I preach on the Holy
[4:42] Ghost why didn't why didn't I do this he
[4:45] says here it is now it's when he says
[4:48] that it's interesting because he's
[4:49] acknowledging that he's not at least in
[4:52] the way I see this he's acknowledging
[4:54] that he doesn't preach on it like the
[4:55] person was asking other words why don't
[4:57] you preach on the Holy Ghost why don't
[4:58] you teach us how to do this and why
[5:00] don't you emphasize this and emphasize
[5:02] that a lot of times brother B said
[5:03] people wanted to be able to manifest the
[5:05] gifts and teach us how to do that and
[5:07] and and and work those things out and he
[5:09] say well how could I teach you that if
[5:10] you don't know your
[5:12] ABCs and so he says um here it is in
[5:15] other words okay I'll acknowledge that
[5:16] I'm not giving you what you think you
[5:18] want he says the Holy Ghost is the
[5:20] action in you amen it's a life not an
[5:23] emotion so maybe they were wanting these
[5:25] people were wanting to teach on the
[5:26] emotional side the physical side not
[5:28] some sort of Flesh evidence so maybe
[5:30] they wanted to see the gifts taught and
[5:32] and the gifts in manifestation but he's
[5:34] saying I don't emphasize that I
[5:36] emphasize the holy ghost in a person
[5:38] being an action called a life he says
[5:41] but it is a person Jesus Christ the word
[5:43] of God established in your heart to
[5:46] Quicken every word of this age that's
[5:49] what we want we want the Holy Ghost to
[5:51] Quicken every word of this age watch the
[5:54] Holy Ghost In Action not so much in
[5:57] demonstrations but in action what it
[5:59] does according to the word because
[6:02] that's true Revelation true Revelation
[6:04] is God interpreting the his own word by
[6:06] vindicating what is promised he
[6:08] interprets it by bringing it to pass he
[6:11] vindicates it by manifesting it and so
[6:13] we want the Holy Ghost In Action what
[6:16] does that mean the word coming to pass
[6:18] in my life life lived by the word is the
[6:21] word
[6:22] expressed and so Revelation is how God
[6:25] builds us into a Powerhouse you want to
[6:28] know how that we're built into a power
[6:29] Power House of God he does it by
[6:31] revelation we become the PowerHouse of
[6:33] his indwelling Spirit as Revelation
[6:35] establishes us upon a foundation and
[6:38] builds us up into the stature of Christ
[6:41] Peter said we are Lively stones and are
[6:44] built up a spiritual house a holy
[6:46] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[6:48] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[6:51] Christ so you are a living Stone you are
[6:54] a living element in the body of Christ
[6:56] and you are built up yourself as a
[6:58] spiritual house
[7:00] the Bible says you are the Temple of the
[7:02] Holy Ghost so that's where the kingdom
[7:05] is it's in the hearts of
[7:07] men now I hope this will be kind of a
[7:09] good transition to go forward we'll
[7:11] review quickly these scriptures we read
[7:13] in Proverbs Proverbs chap 24: 3 4 and 5
[7:18] it says through wisdom is a house
[7:20] builded so a house is built by wisdom by
[7:24] understanding it is established so if we
[7:26] could think in terms of the house is
[7:28] built by wisdom
[7:30] and then it's made firm and its
[7:31] longevity and its strength lies in
[7:35] understanding you following me can build
[7:38] a house but there's there's a way that
[7:39] you you build it in a way that it lasts
[7:41] or you preserve it you keep it so it
[7:44] last and by knowledge shall the chambers
[7:47] be filled with all precious and pleasant
[7:49] riches so there's a building of it
[7:51] there's a keeping of it and then there's
[7:52] a filling of it wisdom builds it
[7:56] understanding establishes it and then
[7:58] knowledge is is going to fill it with
[8:00] good things that's a template for our
[8:02] lives that's a template for a church
[8:04] that's a template for our homes that
[8:06] wisdom will build the house
[8:07] understanding will establish it and
[8:09] knowledge will fill it with all the
[8:10] right things a wise man is strong in
[8:12] other words knowledge is power a man of
[8:15] knowledge increases strength and this is
[8:18] looking at the structure something that
[8:20] is built we're looking at the the I the
[8:22] the thought of Kingdom
[8:24] Builders that wisdom is what builds
[8:27] understands what establishes knowledge
[8:28] is what FS it so we never want to
[8:30] downplay the importance of revelation we
[8:32] never want to stop seeking after wisdom
[8:34] we want to desire uh understanding and
[8:36] the knowledge of the word of God that's
[8:38] what Paul taught us on the fullness of
[8:40] these things and to desire these things
[8:41] and the prayer that he had for us it
[8:44] says in Proverbs Chapter n wisdom hath
[8:46] builded her
[8:48] house she hath heun out her Seven
[8:53] Pillars God's word we know is his power
[8:56] it is his
[8:57] wisdom and we looked into the scripture
[9:00] and we saw that how God by his wisdom
[9:01] created the heavens and the Earth and
[9:03] God by his power
[9:05] established and created and so the
[9:08] wisdom of God creates the power of God
[9:11] is something that orders it erects it
[9:13] builds this is something that God's word
[9:14] does he says my word will not return
[9:16] void so the word is effective the word
[9:19] does something it accomplishes something
[9:21] the word's just not something that's
[9:22] just there and go we'll eat the word the
[9:24] word the word the word manifest the word
[9:26] accomplishes the word does things don't
[9:29] let anyone lie to you and turn word only
[9:31] into nothing but letter but if we
[9:33] believe the word only that means there's
[9:35] power in it there's life in it there
[9:37] there's Resurrection in it there's
[9:38] healing in it there's salvation in it
[9:41] and so we believe in a word that has
[9:42] power we believe in a word that has life
[9:45] because the word of God is something
[9:46] that creates where there is nothing is
[9:48] something that preserves what is created
[9:50] when it had not been before and it will
[9:52] build and it erect and it'll establish
[9:54] and and it'll order by his wisdom so it
[9:58] says wisdom have built her house and
[10:01] this and heun out her Seven Pillars that
[10:04] word seven is to speak of completeness
[10:07] there's ways that you could type that to
[10:08] the the fruit of the spirit and a lot of
[10:10] different elements that kind of tie
[10:12] together but the pillars speak of
[10:14] something that is guiding and supporting
[10:15] something something sets upon a pillar
[10:18] it's raised something up so this is the
[10:21] it's she's he out Seven Pillars uh if we
[10:25] if you want to look at in terms of
[10:26] building a house uh these are things
[10:28] that are supporting the structure I'm
[10:31] going to preserve it against flood and
[10:33] earthquake and shifting of Sands and and
[10:36] and the and the water and rock and
[10:38] whatever might happen it's something to
[10:40] make it firm and establish it and so the
[10:42] pillars uh guide and support and build
[10:45] up and it and it says it's heun it out
[10:50] it's divided it it's cut it out and it's
[10:52] used in the sense of a Mason that cuts
[10:54] out a stone to be fit into a building so
[10:57] wisdom hath heed out the pillars shape
[11:00] them place them to hold things up to
[11:03] give the structure its support this is
[11:05] what wisdom does separates out it
[11:07] divides out it it crafts and it builds
[11:10] wisdom is a
[11:11] builder in 1st Samuel chap 2: 7 and8 now
[11:16] I think I just maybe have one more uh
[11:18] quote to use to kind of tie in from one
[11:21] of these prior services but this here is
[11:23] going to be a very important part uh for
[11:25] the remaining of our time together this
[11:26] morning and 1st Samuel chapter 2: 7 and
[11:29] 8 the Lord maketh I just want you to
[11:32] think of his his activity the Lord
[11:34] maketh poor and maketh Rich he bringeth
[11:38] low and lifteth up he raiseth up the
[11:41] poor Out of the Dust I like this says he
[11:43] makes the poor but then he lifts the
[11:45] poor Out of the Dust and lifteth up the
[11:48] beggar from the dung Hill to set them
[11:51] among
[11:52] princes and to make them inherit the
[11:55] Throne of Glory wow what a statement
[11:57] this is Hannah and Her prayer before the
[11:59] Lord when she's beseeching him with this
[12:02] painful desire for a son and for a child
[12:04] and being
[12:05] mocked and and desirous and pleading
[12:09] she's talking about God's character and
[12:11] what she's witnessed and the Lord makes
[12:13] the poor but then he raises the poor Out
[12:15] of the Dust he lifts the beggar from the
[12:16] dungill to set them the beggar the poor
[12:19] among princes to make them inherit the
[12:22] Throne of Glory what prophecy what great
[12:25] utterance and it says for The Pillars of
[12:28] the Earth are the Lords and Heath set
[12:31] the world upon
[12:33] them when it says wisdom hath builded
[12:35] her house and sheath heun out her Seven
[12:37] Pillars we could see that even the word
[12:39] the Earth is Anem is emblematic of this
[12:43] house that wisdom
[12:44] builds and that the the wisdom uh that
[12:48] builds is connected with creation and he
[12:51] says that the pillars of the Earth are
[12:53] the Lords so there's something in the
[12:56] earth that is the Lords that he's hun
[12:58] out that he's fashioned that he's framed
[13:00] in his wisdom and he sets the world upon
[13:02] those pillars that's what guides it
[13:04] that's what keeps it up that's what
[13:05] gives it purpose and meaning these
[13:07] pillars as she uses it in this word in
[13:09] the Hebrew this this molten column or
[13:12] support maybe there is something she's
[13:14] thinking about in the earth uh the
[13:17] support comes the molten lava the
[13:19] structure of the earth that is holding
[13:20] the crust up and keeping everything in
[13:22] it shape or its form he says that God's
[13:25] wisdom established the world on these
[13:27] firm pillars amen doesn't collapse in
[13:30] upon itself it's not just free flow and
[13:32] it's not chaotic but God has set this
[13:34] and
[13:35] established it on his by his wisdom on
[13:38] these pillars and remember the whole
[13:40] theme in this the Earth holds the
[13:42] mystery of Heaven this creation of the
[13:45] Earth this creation of the world holds
[13:47] the mystery of heaven and in the Earth
[13:50] was a hidden purpose there was a a
[13:52] supernatural purpose and a hidden glory
[13:54] in the earth though in creation we
[13:56] didn't see it but God is signaling it
[13:58] God is speaking of it and you're going
[14:00] to see even in the end something rise up
[14:02] out of the earth that was there by seed
[14:05] that God had visioned in the beginning
[14:06] God knew it was going to get there so
[14:08] it's been there from the very time that
[14:10] God created the Earth waiting for it to
[14:12] be revealed for that Eighth Day that's a
[14:16] remarkable a testimony that's a
[14:18] remarkable
[14:20] mystery and it's God's wisdom that
[14:23] created the Heaven and the Earth so it's
[14:26] God's wisdom that creates WID wisdom
[14:29] builds the
[14:30] house understanding establishes it
[14:32] knowledge fills it what those things
[14:35] those principles the whole Earth shall
[14:36] be full of the knowledge of God and
[14:37] we're using this as a template to look
[14:39] at ourselves this is what God does in
[14:42] me now in the sermon everpresent water
[14:46] from the rock this would be a good
[14:48] sermon maybe for some to go back and
[14:50] listen to if you feel
[14:52] inclined I'm just pulling from a few
[14:54] places in here that's just just so
[14:56] excellent he says we are now in Heavenly
[14:58] places
[14:59] we are now in the power of the
[15:01] Resurrection if there wasn't a law to
[15:03] that this is what I want you to see now
[15:05] as we've hopefully established just a
[15:07] few things in review
[15:09] there Sons and Daughters of God if there
[15:11] wasn't a law Sons and Daughters of God
[15:12] would create them a world out here and
[15:16] go live a private life on it and Sons
[15:18] and Daughters of God said
[15:20] amen right there wasn't a law we would
[15:23] create a
[15:25] world and live a private life on in
[15:27] other words he's saying you get away
[15:28] from here you have the power in you to
[15:32] do it amen and just to make the point he
[15:35] says if you got a shadow of the power of
[15:37] God in you you've got power to do it God
[15:39] is
[15:40] omnipotent see what I mean the power
[15:43] that's in you will make you could speak
[15:45] a world into existence and go live on it
[15:48] do we believe that the Chris it's nice
[15:51] to have you back didn't realize you'd be
[15:52] back so soon he was away in Ohio
[15:55] visiting being a grandpa I'm sure there
[15:58] there's
[15:59] there there's a power in a Believer now
[16:01] there's a power in us now to be able to
[16:04] speak speak and create another
[16:09] world now when we say create another
[16:11] world we might just think of another
[16:12] planet somewhere or an island somewhere
[16:14] in the tropics I don't know what you
[16:16] envision but it's the same creative
[16:19] power that God has is in you because
[16:22] he's related to the power of God so it's
[16:24] not your own power it's the power of God
[16:25] to create so you could create another
[16:28] world world and live a private life on
[16:30] it one that would seemingly be
[16:32] disconnected from any reality
[16:35] here and he he comes back to it in a a
[16:38] few statements later if you are a son of
[16:40] God you are a daughter of God that never
[16:43] leaves
[16:44] you so the power is there he says it's
[16:47] you with you all the time but your faith
[16:49] gets away from it but it's still there
[16:52] so there is a power in a born again son
[16:54] or daughter of God to create a world and
[16:57] live in it
[16:59] I says it's always there but our faith
[17:01] it's controlled by the law of faith and
[17:03] the reason why we can't create that
[17:05] world and that private life to live on
[17:07] is because it could only operate in
[17:09] faith you say Well then why can't I use
[17:10] it he says it's there you got to use it
[17:12] by faith amen Faith's resting place is
[17:15] the word of God Amen I hope today as we
[17:18] wrap this up I can give you a place for
[17:21] your faith to rest to create that
[17:24] world and now everybody's
[17:27] awake now we ministered a few subject
[17:30] services on Millennium
[17:33] preparation and how that the Earth is
[17:35] going to be purified for a millennium I
[17:37] hope this isn't too much of a hard turn
[17:40] here but the Earth is going to be
[17:42] purified for a millennium and brother BR
[17:44] saying the Earth renews herself so
[17:46] there's a baptism of fire that the whole
[17:48] Earth surface brother BR says that the
[17:50] Earth has changed and future home he
[17:51] really details that and that ushers in
[17:54] the Eighth Day the perfect Kingdom but
[17:57] before that before White Throne judgment
[17:59] after the first resurrection after
[18:01] tribulation there's a purging and a
[18:03] purifying the molten lava and the
[18:05] upheaval and the volcanics and the
[18:06] atomic bombs there's a purifying of the
[18:10] Earth and the Earth renews herself out
[18:14] then and and we're looking at that in in
[18:18] type for us as we can there's a
[18:20] purifying now that's taking place now
[18:23] there's a there's a purging there's a
[18:24] purifying then for the eighth day we
[18:27] know that God will change the World by
[18:29] fire to bring forth a new Heaven and a
[18:31] new Earth not a replacement but a
[18:33] regeneration a
[18:35] renewal now brother bam makes this
[18:37] statement in the future home of the
[18:38] Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[18:40] bride I've laid a foundation now
[18:44] hopefully we could just take a step into
[18:45] a very specific area here when he's
[18:48] talking about that purification and that
[18:51] renewal and the new Heaven and new earth
[18:53] coming forth for the eth day the future
[18:55] home he said it's only the atmospheres
[18:57] around it and the sin that's upon the
[18:59] Earth that'll be
[19:01] destroyed now the total Annihilation is
[19:03] of sin and death and all the wickedness
[19:05] and anything that would contaminate or
[19:07] pollute nothing can def nothing that can
[19:09] defile will be left we realize that the
[19:12] heaven Heavens means the atmospheres
[19:15] above what does it do if then these
[19:17] thistles and sickness and death and
[19:19] politics and sinful man and sinful woman
[19:21] and evil spirits will be gone away and
[19:24] annihilated think of all the pollution
[19:26] in the world right now say it has to be
[19:29] done that way because we're going to
[19:30] live right here those are the things
[19:33] that have to go not the original spoken
[19:34] word attribute of God not the things
[19:36] that have Redemption remember there's no
[19:38] Redemption for hell therefore it ceased
[19:40] to exist There's No Redemption for sin
[19:42] so it ceased to exist but there's
[19:44] Redemption for this Earth and part of
[19:46] its Redemption process is to get rid of
[19:48] anything that polluted it anything that
[19:50] contaminated anything that keeps it from
[19:52] being the
[19:54] original so he says we're going to live
[19:56] right here we'll prove that by the Bible
[19:58] right here is where we live now notice
[20:01] thistles germs all sickness and things
[20:02] will be completely taken away all this
[20:05] it's existence that's in the earth now
[20:08] oh hopefully you can just start grabbing
[20:09] a hold this man-made systems politics
[20:12] sin all kinds of evil spirits that the
[20:15] world is contaminated with and all the
[20:17] heavens above us is in here is
[20:19] contaminated with evil
[20:21] spirit right I know what's going to
[20:24] happen is most if not all of you going
[20:26] to get ahead of me and if you do you
[20:29] just amen me to the Finish Line you just
[20:31] drag me to where you already get and if
[20:33] you're getting there it's going to be
[20:34] exciting to see it he's saying now the
[20:37] world is contaminated with evil spirits
[20:39] politics man-made systems all kind of
[20:41] evil spirits now we're going to go deep
[20:43] and long in
[20:46] this I don't know we are but we're going
[20:48] to we're going to get into it he says
[20:50] all this exists in the heavens or
[20:52] atmospheres and the Earth which is
[20:55] now these things exist in the atmosphere
[20:59] sin politics evil spirits it's in the
[21:01] atmosphere it's around us it's in it's
[21:04] in these in these Realms around us the
[21:07] Earth holds these
[21:11] things but it wasn't made for that
[21:14] purpose and that's where he says and
[21:16] your bodies were laid in this earth
[21:18] right the Earth's purpose wasn't for sin
[21:20] it was to get a bride out of it says
[21:22] your bodies were all laiden here God's
[21:23] Building Material he's been Gathering
[21:25] that material is what he's saying here
[21:26] says the Earth holds those things but it
[21:28] wasn't made for that purpose it wasn't
[21:30] made to hold sin wasn't made to be
[21:32] contamined it wasn't made for politics
[21:33] it wasn't made for evil spirits sin
[21:35] caused it to be like that it was made by
[21:38] God the
[21:40] Creator so he's tying it back to
[21:42] something about God's nature to be a
[21:44] Creator and God made it in his wisdom
[21:47] and when he did he put pillars in it to
[21:49] hold it up so despite all the
[21:51] contamination nothing could collapse
[21:53] those pillars despite all the wickedness
[21:56] and sin and atomic bombs and everything
[21:58] that man can man could suck out all the
[22:00] oil out of it he could try to take all
[22:01] the water out of it he could try to mine
[22:03] all the minerals out of he could keep
[22:05] transforming its elements and building
[22:06] things out of it and using science and
[22:09] compositions to completely change all
[22:11] the elements in the earth and build
[22:13] something on the surface that changes
[22:15] what it originally looked like but God
[22:16] says nothing like that can change the
[22:19] Earth at its core in what its
[22:23] purposes and when God brings forth that
[22:26] Eighth Day brother B said it's the
[22:27] atmosph speres that are changed so God
[22:30] the
[22:31] creator creates a new
[22:34] atmosphere he said it's the atmospheres
[22:36] that take it's a total removal and
[22:38] annihilation of anything that
[22:39] contaminates it's bringing everything
[22:41] back to the original and this future
[22:43] home he's saying is connected with he
[22:45] points this out in more than just this
[22:46] one place it's connected with the
[22:48] perfect
[22:50] atmosphere now if I could just summarize
[22:52] a little bit on this subject of the
[22:54] Kingdom We Believe according to the word
[22:56] of the hour the kingdom is on on Earth
[22:59] today and is in Earth today and is in
[23:03] the hearts of his
[23:05] bride and this is part of Heaven's
[23:07] mystery the kingdom in Earth now and we
[23:10] mentioned I think the very first service
[23:12] first few Services how that we're
[23:13] inspired with the thought that there's
[23:15] this lie we call the the LIE of
[23:17] Catholicism that kind of divides and
[23:19] it's in nominal Christianity that
[23:21] divides eternity into hell in
[23:25] heaven and they say that hell is ET
[23:27] Eternal Heaven's Eternal in time in life
[23:31] that we exist in right now is merely is
[23:33] only a choosing place a to decide
[23:37] whether you'll spend eternity in Hell or
[23:39] eternity in heaven and with that kind of
[23:43] idea is kind of sets forth that well the
[23:46] the the heaven is the be all end all
[23:48] that's where you want to be and you want
[23:49] to avoid hell and kind of all we do on
[23:52] Earth is just make our choice and kind
[23:54] of guess wait till we get
[23:55] there and it when it divides eternity
[23:58] between two
[23:59] destinations I it it it adds with it the
[24:02] idea that Earth is going to be destroyed
[24:05] so here where we live right now is so
[24:07] temperat it's like ah this life it's a
[24:09] nothing right it's a nothing Burger it's
[24:13] going to be gone and you're going to end
[24:15] up in eternity and it's either going to
[24:17] be heaven or hell and kind in presenting
[24:19] that it really changes the reality of
[24:23] what this life is for and how important
[24:26] this life is and how one day we're going
[24:28] to come right back here and live again
[24:32] and we were hoping that we could bring
[24:34] some relevance considering what will be
[24:36] in eternity bring some relevance to what
[24:38] is now using this Plan of Redemption of
[24:41] the earth to see the Plan of Redemption
[24:42] our own lives make today more relevant
[24:45] to us and brother Bram says in Christ is
[24:48] the mystery God revealed we belong to a
[24:50] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[24:53] God made spirit and life in our own life
[24:56] amen
[24:58] that's the kingdom the word of God made
[25:00] spirit and life andal life bringing to
[25:02] pass every promise in this day as it did
[25:05] in that day when the word in God was
[25:08] one as it was in Christ so shall it be
[25:10] in US amen the way he was and the Word
[25:13] was one with him it's to be that way
[25:14] with the bride the kingdom is the word
[25:17] made spirit and life it is the Holy
[25:19] Ghost In Action in you not so much in
[25:22] demonstrations but fulfilling the word
[25:23] of God for this hour amen and the word
[25:26] and God is one in his church today
[25:29] making it the headship of the body that
[25:31] is redeemed to bring the message in the
[25:32] last day the kingdom is the
[25:35] unity the union of Heaven and Earth the
[25:39] unity of deity and flesh this is what we
[25:41] see embodied in the and in in the and
[25:44] the example of Christ Heaven and Earth
[25:46] embracing the bride is the Earth's Glory
[25:48] but she's the mystery of Heaven as she
[25:50] comes out of the earth as she's what God
[25:52] had hidden the Earth from the
[25:54] beginning God the creator has designed
[25:57] this
[25:59] God for that eighth day is going to
[26:01] create a perfect
[26:03] atmosphere and Genesis chapter 1 verses
[26:06] 1 2 and 3 in the beginning God created
[26:08] the Heaven and the Earth then in the end
[26:10] we see new Heaven and new Earth and the
[26:12] Earth was without form and void and
[26:14] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[26:17] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[26:19] face of the waters and God said let
[26:21] there be light and there was light in
[26:23] verse four we see that God he separates
[26:26] divides light from dark he separates
[26:29] this is what's transforming in the
[26:30] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[26:32] Earth and though there might have been
[26:33] this chaotic form this amalgamation of
[26:36] things and indiscernible and darkness
[26:39] upon the Earth it's the spirit of God
[26:41] that moves and light comes forth and
[26:44] distinction comes and God separates
[26:46] light from
[26:48] dark we tou we touched on how the
[26:50] brother Bram said the one who created
[26:51] the Heaven and the Earth expresses
[26:53] himself through his creation what he is
[26:56] in his program
[26:58] so God who creates the Heaven and Earth
[27:00] expresses himself in Heaven and Earth
[27:03] his program is expressed in these things
[27:05] in the beginning when God created the
[27:06] Heaven and Earth and then shows this in
[27:08] verse two shows it in verse three shows
[27:10] it in verse four and we could go on and
[27:11] on and on God is expressing himself in
[27:13] the creation the kingdom of God as
[27:16] brother said science achieves Looking
[27:18] Backward God achieves going this way
[27:20] going forward to the kingdom God
[27:23] achieves by his word by Revelation by
[27:25] creation and he's always been achieving
[27:27] to the kingdom science achieves downward
[27:30] to death God achieves towards the
[27:32] Kingdom so God is expressing the kingdom
[27:35] in Genesis one I know this is review for
[27:37] us but I just wanted to lay that back in
[27:39] there to tie this together because then
[27:41] brother brandham says in God's power to
[27:42] transform in Genesis 1 this is just
[27:45] another part of the review the world was
[27:47] without form and it was void Darkness
[27:50] was upon the Earth nothing but a
[27:52] complete chaos and when this world was
[27:54] in that condition the spirit of God
[27:56] moved upon on the face of the water and
[27:59] the entire picture was changed from a
[28:02] total chaos to a Garden of Eden think of
[28:05] how brother brand I'm talking about this
[28:06] world has man-made system politics sin
[28:09] all kinds of evil spirits contaminating
[28:11] the heavens the atmospheres think of
[28:12] that dimension of science that fourth
[28:14] dimension think of all these uh radio
[28:16] waves and all the sin and all the scars
[28:18] everything upon the Earth man-made
[28:20] creation and all the uh the the
[28:23] combustible engines and and all the
[28:25] electric cars and all the mechanic
[28:27] devices and all the screens think of all
[28:29] the things all the
[28:31] junkyards think of all the trash think
[28:34] of the ocean and all the litter and all
[28:36] the pollution and all the smog and
[28:37] everything that clings to the Earth all
[28:39] that is in it and brother Bram is saying
[28:42] here look at what God did to the Earth
[28:44] in its chaotic form in the entire
[28:46] picture was changed from Total Chaos to
[28:48] a Garden of Eden that's the transforming
[28:51] power of God that can take something
[28:54] that's nothing and make something
[28:56] wonderful out of of
[28:58] it that's the transforming power of God
[29:01] that can take something that's nothing
[29:02] and makees something wonderful out of it
[29:05] remember how we used that statement to
[29:06] show that in Peter Peter's talking about
[29:08] the world that was the world that became
[29:10] the world that was now showing us how
[29:12] After the flood these things change we
[29:13] can see that God transforms the world
[29:15] that then was in Genesis 1:2 to the
[29:18] Heaven and Earth which is which are now
[29:20] this transforming power bringing forth
[29:24] something
[29:25] new brother bham says is this or for
[29:29] some of you at least I can't say it's
[29:30] for everybody can you individually say
[29:31] all right I can see some pieces here
[29:34] this is moving along anybody feel that
[29:36] we got some pieces to work with here am
[29:39] he
[29:40] says brother says an attitude and who is
[29:44] God who is God the one that stood there
[29:47] and rolled Stars off his hands and rolls
[29:49] worlds out of his hands and made things
[29:51] which do not appear
[29:53] deity and deity himself lives in man
[29:58] amen the Creator that made heavens and
[30:01] earth lives in
[30:02] mankind the Bible said we are Sons and
[30:05] Daughters of God his offspring now then
[30:07] we're something like God was deity here
[30:09] with us deity in us this is what he's
[30:13] drawn from when he says that you could
[30:14] speak a world into existence and go live
[30:16] on it a private life on it why because
[30:18] deity is in you this one that creates
[30:21] this one that has power this one that
[30:23] has wisdom knowledge and understanding
[30:25] deity lives in man that's the king om
[30:27] God in you it is the spirit is the word
[30:30] of God made Spirit of life in our own
[30:32] life this is telling us that God the
[30:34] Eternal God the omnipotent God the
[30:37] omniscient lives in Me by the new birth
[30:40] lives in Me by the Holy Ghost I am a
[30:43] temple of God I am a temple of the Holy
[30:46] Ghost there's deity that lives in
[30:49] man and I know that we so often relate
[30:52] that only to Jesus Christ but he says
[30:54] it's to bring to pass every promise in
[30:56] this day as it did in the day when the
[30:57] word in God was one in other words as it
[30:59] was in Jesus Christ is to be in
[31:02] you now this this is just a small step
[31:05] but I'm taking a step forward hopefully
[31:07] you can follow me now in looking at the
[31:09] example of Jesus Christ he says but
[31:11] Jesus lived in a world that no one knew
[31:13] about he was an odd person now catch
[31:16] this because we're talking about Kingdom
[31:20] Builders and as we've been relating it
[31:22] to wisdom we wanted to connect that with
[31:23] God's power to create you could create a
[31:26] world and go live in it
[31:27] it's a power that lives in You Now by
[31:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[31:31] there
[31:32] is that this that's what the kingdom is
[31:34] is God living in you and God is a
[31:36] Creator and when God created in the very
[31:39] beginning he took total chaos and
[31:41] transformed it into something wonderful
[31:43] something that was nothing and made
[31:44] something wonderful out of it that God
[31:46] lives in
[31:47] you that's what I wanted you to see this
[31:49] idea of creation this idea of power
[31:52] lives in US Jesus lived a world that no
[31:54] one knew about he was an odd person he
[31:56] lived in a world of perfect faith in the
[31:59] perfect God in which he
[32:02] was are you connecting some things here
[32:05] you controlled by a law have the power
[32:08] to create a world and go live in it now
[32:11] he says that Jesus lived in a world of
[32:12] perfect faith in the perfect God which
[32:14] he was if we lived in a perfect faith of
[32:17] a Christian to what we are we'd be a
[32:20] Mystic to the world the people wouldn't
[32:23] understand you you'd walk in the spirit
[32:25] what the spirit said you would do what
[32:26] it forbid you would not do then the
[32:28] people would begin to say you'd be a
[32:30] Mystic to them that's the way it is to
[32:32] all believers they are a Mystic the
[32:35] people don't understand listen because
[32:37] they live in a world to
[32:40] themselves they live in a world to
[32:42] themselves Jesus lived in a world that
[32:45] nobody else could
[32:47] touch I want to bring it down to Kingdom
[32:50] Builders today that if we've got power
[32:53] inside of us to create another world and
[32:55] go live a private life on it then we
[32:58] have the power to build the kingdom and
[33:00] live in it if Jesus lived in a world of
[33:03] perfect faith and the outside world
[33:05] didn't understand it why he was here on
[33:07] Earth in a dark time surrounded by
[33:09] haters surrounded by sin surrounded by
[33:12] unbelief surrounded by threats of death
[33:14] he lived in a world that the world knew
[33:16] nothing about he didn't have to go to
[33:18] another world he lived in a world right
[33:20] here that the world knew nothing about
[33:22] we can build the kingdom and live in it
[33:25] today
[33:27] I want to say to you create a world and
[33:29] live in
[33:31] it create a kingdom and live in it
[33:34] instead of instead of getting the idea
[33:37] well I'm just going to languish until
[33:38] Christ comes well Christ has come into
[33:41] my heart I don't want to languish I want
[33:43] to conquer I don't want to survive I
[33:46] want to overcome and I'm not just going
[33:48] to sit here and watch this one Fade Away
[33:50] what that would Fade Away lose my health
[33:53] lose my wife lose my happiness lose my
[33:55] joy I'm not going to lose any of it I've
[33:58] been given a promise by the word of God
[34:00] and I want it to rise up within me and I
[34:02] want to live in a world of perfect
[34:05] faith I want to do it right
[34:11] now we live in Leo
[34:14] DEA I know that no big Revelation maybe
[34:18] for some it is but we call it Satan's
[34:21] Eden we could track it through so many
[34:23] different scriptures and sermons that
[34:25] brother Brandon preached it's a wicked
[34:27] age of darkness and sin it's the darkest
[34:29] of all
[34:30] ages brother Brandon being hopeful maybe
[34:33] gave a little bit of light when he drew
[34:34] out the church ages but when the Holy
[34:35] Spirit revealed it blacked
[34:38] out giving multiple Witnesses of it
[34:42] Christ has been kicked out of the church
[34:44] you live in the darkest age has ever
[34:46] been a a conglomeration of evil an
[34:49] accumulation of
[34:51] sin permeating mankind it's in that way
[34:54] I feel that anymore we can't use we
[34:57] can't necessarily use
[34:59] history as an accurate predictor because
[35:02] it just keeps getting
[35:04] worse it it changing it's getting even
[35:07] uh the way things work say oh well it's
[35:09] always been this way it's always been
[35:10] this way no it's it's it's never been
[35:13] this bad that's right maybe there's
[35:16] nothing new Under the Sun but the
[35:18] there's going to be a cup that fills up
[35:19] there there's going to be a fullness of
[35:21] even the wickedness and we're in that
[35:23] time where the morals and everything is
[35:25] just completely decayed yes and now I
[35:28] want to I want to read this statement
[35:31] I've been listening to uh what house
[35:33] will you build me and brother brandom
[35:35] and I just want you to think of that
[35:37] title what house will you build
[35:40] me and I'm I'm I'm reading it this
[35:42] morning because I a family from Tucson
[35:45] is out of town he says spiritual
[35:48] speaking over the city I don't know of
[35:50] any place that's any more spiritually
[35:52] dead or spiritual dead than in the City
[35:54] of Tucson and all the Phoenicians said
[35:57] amen that's right you can call yourself
[36:00] Jerusalem all you want
[36:02] to he say spiritually speaking I don't
[36:05] know of any place that's more spiritual
[36:07] dead than in the City of Tucson now what
[36:10] I'm about to read brother Bram says
[36:11] essentially the same things about
[36:13] Phoenix so we're just going to lump
[36:15] ourselves into here but I want us to
[36:16] think about the climate we live
[36:19] in spiritually speaking spiritually dead
[36:23] there's war between the churches there's
[36:25] fusses between the
[36:27] congregations Spirits don't die there's
[36:30] no Unity everyone grabbing and holding
[36:34] and squeezing trying to get this one and
[36:36] prelighting it is a desert spiritually
[36:39] speaking also this is the this is
[36:41] Brother diagnosis he says the same
[36:43] things about Maricopa County says the
[36:45] same things about Phoenix and Arizona it
[36:47] was a spirit that's on this area and
[36:49] it's existed for over 70 years 80 years
[36:51] you can go back to the 40s brother Brown
[36:53] was calling out a nature that still
[36:55] permeates and exist to
[36:57] today that's what we live inside of
[37:00] that's what we live
[37:02] around now this is I want this to become
[37:05] very real to us you know what I'm
[37:07] talking about let's not play dumb let's
[37:10] not play ignorant it exists it's the
[37:13] atmospheres that exist it's the
[37:15] attitudes that exist it's what tries to
[37:16] get on us and make us competitive tries
[37:19] to get on us and make us judgy and draw
[37:21] circles it's a spirit that we've got to
[37:23] defend against the spirit of the phoenix
[37:26] the spir Spirit of Arizona the spirit of
[37:28] Tucson we got to defend against the
[37:30] spirit of the
[37:33] desert the grabbing the holding the
[37:35] squeezing the
[37:38] prelighting I want you just allow your
[37:41] your thoughts to wonder for five seconds
[37:43] think about the condition of the world
[37:45] that we live in five four three two is
[37:50] it distracting if I'm counting think of
[37:52] it what we're living in think of all I
[37:54] want you to get inside your mind
[37:57] mind it's just it's it's aggravating
[38:01] right it's teeth
[38:04] clenching everything just grates eats at
[38:07] you and the world is just trying to find
[38:10] ways to trigger
[38:11] you right just just find just the right
[38:15] circumstance where it seems like
[38:16] everything's fine all a it's
[38:18] like no matter what it is that's what we
[38:22] it's an aggravated climate it's an
[38:24] agitated atmosphere it's a frenzy
[38:27] there's friction that it's
[38:29] tumultuous trying to get us on edge
[38:33] right it's neurotic it's tension high
[38:36] stress and everything and we don't even
[38:38] necessarily realize it things are
[38:40] building pressure is building it's what
[38:43] we live in and in the sermon everpresent
[38:45] water from the Rock brother Brown's
[38:47] talking about the desert and the
[38:48] spiritual condition of being a dry place
[38:49] and the cactus and the prickly and it
[38:51] gets really really dry and when it gets
[38:53] dry the grass dies and when you walk on
[38:55] the grass there's stickers and there's
[38:56] briers and you try to go on a a walk or
[38:58] a hike to enjoy it and there's
[38:59] rattlesnakes and there's jumping cactus
[39:01] and there's rocks and there's all sorts
[39:04] of things and there's just like a whole
[39:05] herd of dogs that have been there before
[39:07] you and if there's if it's not bagged
[39:09] it's just it's if it's bagged it's left
[39:11] it's a nightmare got doggy diapers
[39:14] everywhere and and and then you think
[39:16] it's everywhere it's a dry place it's an
[39:19] aggravating place it's a it's a place of
[39:22] tension spiritually speaking it's dead
[39:25] he says
[39:27] and brother BR says but that's where
[39:29] them who live in that place have to
[39:31] suffer with the conditions of that
[39:34] place you kind of wait till the weather
[39:36] gets like this before you read
[39:38] statements like
[39:40] this but those who live in that place
[39:42] have to suffer with the conditions of
[39:44] that place talk about the dry place the
[39:46] the cactus the
[39:47] pricklies and those who desire to live
[39:50] in that kind of an
[39:51] atmosphere not talking about the desert
[39:53] now but notice spiritually speaking
[39:55] those who desire live in that kind of an
[39:57] atmosphere where everything's just
[39:58] punching and fussing and quarreling and
[40:02] stewing like that well you'll just live
[40:04] under that atmosphere that's
[40:08] all but we don't have to live
[40:12] there hope you catch what I'm saying but
[40:15] we don't have to live there it's not
[40:17] necessary for us to stay
[40:20] there there are certain that we if we
[40:22] say well this is where I live this is
[40:24] where my job is this is where my family
[40:26] is this is I don't know where else to go
[40:28] I don't know what else to do and and
[40:29] this is where I was born and raised or
[40:31] this is where I I built a home whatever
[40:33] the reasons we find ourselves in Phoenix
[40:35] or Arizona I mean God forbid that you
[40:37] would just uproot and move all the way
[40:39] from Back East uh to Phoenix for no
[40:41] other reason than to start a church but
[40:42] for whatever reason you're here but
[40:45] you're here said well it's hot and the
[40:47] economy is bad and this is happening
[40:49] that's happening and it's fussing it's
[40:51] stewing it's a spiritual desert there's
[40:53] punching there's fussing there's quing
[40:54] Ste he says those who desire to live in
[40:57] that can but you don't have
[40:59] to you don't have to you might be
[41:01] thinking oh well yes there's a door for
[41:03] me to move but he saying it's not
[41:05] necessary for us to stay there and I
[41:07] want you to think about this because
[41:09] what we could say at the very least is
[41:11] well oh when we all get to heaven but
[41:13] that's not what he's saying he's not
[41:15] saying oh we don't have to live there
[41:17] when we all get to heaven no more
[41:19] fussing no more stewing no more
[41:21] quarreling no more fighting that's not
[41:23] what he's
[41:24] saying we don't have to live there
[41:27] though we live in a place that's
[41:29] spiritually speaking dead though we live
[41:31] in a desert though we live in a time of
[41:32] aggravation and agitation if you want to
[41:35] live there live there but if you don't
[41:37] want to live there you don't have to
[41:38] live
[41:40] there as we read in Acts chap 17: 28 and
[41:44] 29 brother brandom already touched on
[41:47] this he says for now the Bible says for
[41:50] in him in God we live we have life and
[41:53] move we have activity
[41:56] and have our
[41:58] existence that's our reality in him we
[42:01] live move and have our being in him not
[42:04] in Le DEA not in the world not in
[42:07] man-made politics not in sin not in the
[42:08] contaminated atmospheres it's in him and
[42:11] then he draw us from their own uh
[42:13] theology certain also of your own poets
[42:15] have said for we are also his
[42:17] offspring Paul then doesn't dispute that
[42:20] he affirms
[42:21] it first as much then as we are The
[42:25] Offspring of God
[42:27] now if God has an offspring it has to be
[42:30] deity we ought not to think that the
[42:33] godhead is liken to gold or silver or
[42:37] stone Graven by Art and man's
[42:42] devices the godhead
[42:44] godlikeness the headship of God the hood
[42:47] of God the kingdom of God we ought not
[42:50] to think of it as in the terms of gold
[42:51] or silver or stone Graven by Art in
[42:54] man's devices we can't think of the
[42:55] Kingdom in terms of the materials that
[42:57] man works with our weapons are not
[43:00] carnal right so in our spiritual warfare
[43:02] we have Supernatural weapons so he's
[43:04] saying if in him we live and move and
[43:05] have our being then we ought not to
[43:07] think of the Kingdom in terms of gold
[43:10] and silver and stone and things that are
[43:12] fashioned by man we can't look at the
[43:14] building we can't look externally we
[43:16] can't look at somebody who drives a nice
[43:18] car or somebody who builds a nice house
[43:19] or somebody has the finery in life and
[43:21] say oh they must be blessed of God and
[43:23] look at somebody who's destitute say oh
[43:24] God must hate them that's not the
[43:26] kingdom the kingdom is the Holy Ghost in
[43:28] you it's the word in action in you
[43:31] that's something that is measured by
[43:33] different tangibles that the world
[43:35] doesn't measure by in him we live and
[43:37] move and have our being so we ought not
[43:39] to think about the kingdom of God in
[43:42] terms of gold and silver and stone that
[43:45] art and man's imagination and creativity
[43:49] fashion but we ought to think of it in
[43:51] terms of Supernatural
[43:52] things and if if we are his offspring
[43:56] now brother bradam says this and this is
[43:58] I know this is again another step you
[44:00] might think man you really covered a lot
[44:02] of ground today says we are in an
[44:05] amateur way
[44:09] creators he says if we have zoic God's
[44:11] life in us we become sons of God and
[44:14] amateur
[44:16] creators now in saying amateurs we could
[44:18] say maybe we're not paid to do it or uh
[44:22] we we're not professional yet and um but
[44:25] there's he's trying to he's trying to
[44:26] distinguish in us being all God and
[44:30] being Godlike of being The Offspring and
[44:34] the one the the progenitor the one the
[44:36] the initial Creator so we are amateur
[44:39] creators because the Creator himself has
[44:41] brought us forth and birthed us of his
[44:43] own life therefore we have his nature we
[44:45] have his qualities and we as Sons then
[44:47] are little right little
[44:50] creators not the Creator and he uses the
[44:52] terminology to use express says and do
[44:54] you now believe each man that's born
[44:57] again with the spirit of God in him is a
[44:59] miniature creator that might shake you a
[45:01] little bit but that's the truth we are
[45:04] in the image of God God is a
[45:08] Creator if a man's born of the spirit of
[45:10] God he's an offspring of God and that
[45:12] part of God is in him and he believes
[45:14] every word that God says will
[45:17] materialize so that makes him part of
[45:19] God the holy spirit in the man makes him
[45:22] a part of
[45:23] God now have you you following my
[45:26] breadcrumbs and my steps today that if
[45:28] God is inside of you you are a
[45:32] creator that the power of God inside of
[45:34] you has given you power to
[45:37] create and though we live in a world
[45:39] that's chaotic God's given you power to
[45:42] create though you live in a world that's
[45:44] contaminated by sin God's given you
[45:47] power to create though you're surrounded
[45:50] by unbelief God's given you the power to
[45:53] create though you're surrounded by
[45:55] unbeliever
[45:56] God's given you the power to create
[45:58] though you're surrounded by Darkness
[46:00] God's giv you the power to create though
[46:02] you're surrounded by instability God's
[46:04] giving you the power to create though
[46:06] you're surrounded by Darkness God's giv
[46:08] you the power to
[46:10] create Bill said each one of you is a
[46:12] Creator did you know that each one of
[46:16] the people that's born again is a
[46:17] Creator he says we must create an
[46:22] atmosphere amen now I know this opens up
[46:25] a whole new room to
[46:27] explore he says we must create an
[46:29] atmosphere he says Us in so many
[46:31] different places that we could just
[46:33] spend volumes of time on
[46:35] it but remember in future home when
[46:39] God's going to bring forth the perfect
[46:41] Kingdom in the eth day brother BR said
[46:42] it's the atmospheres that are changed
[46:44] he's changing the
[46:46] atmospheres brother says and the things
[46:48] you think on the things that you do the
[46:51] actions the things you talk about
[46:53] creates an
[46:54] atmosphere so now begin to take some
[46:56] responsibility for what's around you
[46:59] amen you're a
[47:01] Creator yes the world's contaminated
[47:03] with sin and unbelief and fussing and
[47:05] stewing and quarreling and arguing it's
[47:06] all there it's going to find its way on
[47:07] your doorstep but your Creator and bass
[47:10] is the things you think on the things
[47:11] that you do the actions the things you
[47:13] talk about create an atmosphere so
[47:15] there's a possibility that you're
[47:17] agitated so you talk about agitated
[47:20] things you're aggravated so you talk
[47:22] about aggravating things and all the
[47:24] atmospheres that we live in are the
[47:25] things that we think on the things that
[47:27] we do and the actions and the things we
[47:29] talk about are now becoming the power of
[47:32] our of our words the power of activity
[47:34] the powers of our thinking and not only
[47:36] is it in the world but now it's in our
[47:38] doorstep and it's in our atmosphere and
[47:41] we're not living in a world of perfect
[47:43] faith and we're not a Mystic because the
[47:44] world says I'm angry just like
[47:46] you I'm pulling my hair out just like
[47:49] you in the same spot that's right I feel
[47:51] just like you do I with I get somebody
[47:54] hey yeah we know what's up in this time
[47:55] time it's a it's a stressful time and
[47:58] and we are the world is identifying with
[48:00] our frustrations with our aggravations
[48:02] with our blowups and our
[48:05] tensions he's saying the things we think
[48:07] about the things we do things we talk
[48:09] about create an atmosphere you are a
[48:13] Creator in the sermon is your life
[48:15] worthy of the Gospel is where he says
[48:16] that then he says this in Divine love
[48:19] and I'm I'm just I I got to wrap this up
[48:21] so I just want to put these things out
[48:24] there for us to hold on to and meditate
[48:26] on he says what type of atmosphere
[48:28] should we live
[48:29] in in a consoling soothing healing
[48:32] atmosphere we should live
[48:34] in that's it go ahead write it down I'll
[48:37] give you a chance five four Consulting
[48:40] soothing healing atmosphere this is the
[48:43] atmosphere we should live in it's
[48:45] consoling it's soothing it's healing
[48:48] doesn't that sound good a consoling
[48:50] soothing that's a nice word soothing
[48:52] just even the phonics of it are good
[48:56] the consoling sothing healing atmosphere
[48:59] that's that's where we should live with
[49:01] our hearts constantly in prayer with the
[49:03] deep love for every person we come in
[49:04] contact with amen talk about a
[49:08] revelation talk about supernatural you
[49:10] want to believe in miracles
[49:12] boom this is what he's saying we ought
[49:14] to live in Consulting soothing healing
[49:19] atmosphere that's the atmosphere you
[49:20] ought to live in now I just want to pose
[49:22] this whose responsibility is it to
[49:25] create
[49:26] it just want to ask you if that's the
[49:29] atmosphere we should live in God's a
[49:31] Creator God can do it if that's the
[49:33] atmosphere we live in and God has made
[49:35] you a Creator God has made you a
[49:37] miniature Creator amateur Creator God
[49:38] has put his own power inside of you
[49:40] you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost and
[49:42] this is the atmosphere we must live in
[49:44] and what we think on what we do what we
[49:46] acted on and what we say creates an
[49:48] atmosphere whose responsibility is it oh
[49:52] Hallelujah when brother Brandon preaches
[49:54] the revelation of Jesus Christ he
[49:56] preaches Revelation 4 part 2 he says
[49:58] about the creation the spirit of God
[50:00] moved upon the water and said let there
[50:01] be light notice what God does God
[50:05] separated them the land and the water
[50:06] which made the Earth but the whole earth
[50:08] was covered over now what he did he just
[50:12] threw the
[50:14] atmospheres he just atmospheres is
[50:16] filled with hydrogen and oxygen and so
[50:18] forth then he just lifted it up off the
[50:21] Earth and separated it Hallelujah now go
[50:24] back to the creation where God looked at
[50:27] the Earth in its chaotic form how did
[50:30] God bring forth these great things we
[50:32] know is the earth he separated
[50:34] atmospheres he lifted up off the Earth
[50:38] and separated it in all its
[50:39] conglomeration and all its darkness and
[50:41] all it's chaos and confusion the Creator
[50:44] the one with the wisdom the one with the
[50:46] Revelation with faith in his own word
[50:48] created and separated atmospheres
[50:51] separated light from Darkness oh
[50:53] Hallelujah think about the plan of red
[50:55] Redemption that God does to the earth
[50:57] and the Plan of Redemption that God does
[50:59] for us in the Millennium in the Eighth
[51:01] Day what God does for the Earth in
[51:03] Millennium what God does for the E the
[51:05] Earth in the eighth day this is what God
[51:07] wants to do for us now oh could it be
[51:10] that God is wanting an atmosphere to be
[51:12] changed for us
[51:14] now that this part of the earth can
[51:18] create the world I live in
[51:21] Amen in that Millennium the lion will
[51:24] lay down with a lamb
[51:26] and the Millennium nature will be set
[51:28] into order think of all those
[51:30] descriptions we read in the scripture
[51:31] just briefly in the last several
[51:33] Services about what that Millennium is
[51:35] going to be like before the final change
[51:37] right showing us that even before this
[51:40] body is changed there's benefits and
[51:43] attributes of the Kingdom Life and
[51:44] Kingdom order that we can participate
[51:47] in why because the god of that kingdom
[51:51] is here am he's living inside of man
[51:54] amen in the Millennium the lion will get
[51:56] along with man and the lamb brother
[51:59] bramman the sermon love says did not the
[52:00] lions come after Daniel and could not
[52:02] touch
[52:03] him the atmosphere was changed amen
[52:06] could the fire burn Shadrach mesach and
[52:08] Abednego the atmosphere was changed and
[52:12] the god of Daniel still lives tonight
[52:14] he's the same God and I ask you where is
[52:16] he right where's the same God that stop
[52:19] the mouths of the ls how did he stop the
[52:21] mouth of the ls he changed the
[52:23] atmosphere he didn't necessarily have to
[52:25] change the nature of the lion he just
[52:27] had to change the atmosphere you can't
[52:30] change the nature of everybody you may
[52:32] not be able to change certain things out
[52:34] there in the world today you can't turn
[52:36] Le to see it upside down but you can
[52:38] turn your world upside down you can
[52:40] change the
[52:43] atmosphere I know it might seem to be a
[52:46] large
[52:47] task but it's the
[52:51] truth we can build our own world and
[52:53] live in it amen
[52:55] we can live in an atmosphere of perfect
[52:57] faith we can live in an atmosphere
[52:59] that's soothing
[53:01] healing
[53:04] consoling
[53:06] now it would be wonderful to know better
[53:10] that we can do
[53:12] that so that we can have the confidence
[53:14] to believe that whenever I'm not there
[53:17] perhaps I've created the wrong
[53:19] atmosphere and I can just get back into
[53:21] the right
[53:22] one that I I I'm not GNA relinquish
[53:25] My Liberty to the devil to the world to
[53:29] sin to the flesh I'm going to say that
[53:32] as a Son of God there's power in me over
[53:34] all of it amen and if I find myself in
[53:37] the flesh if I find myself being tempted
[53:39] if I find myself in the wrong atmosphere
[53:41] then I just got to get out of
[53:43] it because I'm building a
[53:46] kingdom I want to use this example as I
[53:48] close it maybe I have the entirety of
[53:51] the statements before me and I I hope
[53:54] it's okay to do this but I want to read
[53:55] you an example I I think probably some
[53:57] of you are already in your minds
[53:58] thinking of these very things we reading
[54:00] so much from these sermons on love
[54:02] brother BR says that the atmosphere was
[54:05] changed with Daniel and the Lion's Den
[54:08] when those Hebrew children went into the
[54:09] fiery furnace he said the atmosphere was
[54:11] changed he says the same he's the same
[54:13] God
[54:15] today what he didn't do is take Hanah
[54:18] Azariah mishel and take him away from
[54:21] the fire that's right he changed the
[54:23] atmosphere in the fire he didn't even
[54:25] Vanquish the Flames he changed the
[54:27] atmosphere so the atmosphere around him
[54:30] maybe this is what the scientists would
[54:31] say well there just was enough they were
[54:33] just they had they were sweating they
[54:34] were so nervous and when they walked
[54:36] into this furnace just that little bit
[54:37] of evaporation of their sweat they were
[54:39] sweating profusely at this point it just
[54:41] kept the fire off of them so it's
[54:43] scientifically
[54:44] possible you know and there and I can't
[54:46] remember what that reaction is called to
[54:47] where people can handle very hot things
[54:49] and just that thin layer of moisture
[54:51] even upon a person don't try this at
[54:53] home can keep them from being blistered
[54:55] are burn and but it's the atmosphere
[54:57] that
[54:58] changed Daniel wasn't eaten by the Lions
[55:00] because the atmosphere changed that's
[55:02] the power of God inside of
[55:04] us brother Brown makes this statement in
[55:07] that same sermon love he said that's the
[55:08] way it is when a man becomes Born
[55:11] Again listen to this part there's
[55:14] something takes place within him that
[55:16] he's sick and tired of the
[55:19] world I think what happens is when we're
[55:21] born again we are and then we just learn
[55:24] to stop St
[55:26] it right we just learn to just gut it
[55:29] out kind of like what some of us do with
[55:31] the Summers right we just learn to deal
[55:34] with it now it's just the way and and
[55:36] maybe we shouldn't be learning to deal
[55:38] with it right I don't I don't think we
[55:41] should necessarily to become
[55:43] Vigilantes a and during the election
[55:46] season just pick up everybody's Biden
[55:48] sign and create a
[55:49] bonfire but there's something about us
[55:51] to where we we get sick and tired of the
[55:53] world so there's a Godly Spirit around
[55:56] him I said this is what happens that we
[55:58] ought to have this and so now he brings
[56:00] it to a personal example that I think we
[56:01] can all relate to he says my life has
[56:04] been dealing with spiritual things as
[56:05] you understand the meeting you walk up
[56:07] people sometime that try to impersonate
[56:09] some brother brandom I sure got faith in
[56:10] you and you know he's lying so now he's
[56:12] he's able to get past the
[56:14] surface he says that's a spirit there
[56:17] that speaks a lot louder than his lips
[56:19] speak it's the
[56:21] atmosphere so so here's somebody who's
[56:24] saying the right thing but he has an
[56:26] aura about him he's created an
[56:27] atmosphere around him where brother B
[56:28] says no you're lying and if you'll learn
[56:32] love and to be kind to everybody be
[56:33] gentle and have
[56:35] patience he's talkinging about
[56:36] atmosphere it'll even make your home
[56:38] life
[56:40] different it'll make your associations
[56:43] different God will honor you he says now
[56:46] I've tried it and I think you know
[56:48] exactly where we're going with this but
[56:50] I want you to recognize this it'll make
[56:51] your home life different when you
[56:53] exercise the power of the Kingdom the
[56:55] power of Revelation the power of wisdom
[56:56] and understanding applying the token is
[56:58] wisdom and understanding and Revelation
[57:00] there's a lot here we can do he said
[57:02] here's some time ago in my home you can
[57:03] imagine what kind of turmoil it is all
[57:05] the time I he kind of builds the picture
[57:08] what's happening he said one day the
[57:09] house is all completely tore up and he
[57:11] said the basement had been full with
[57:12] people then about dark everything
[57:14] quieted down and he thought everybody
[57:16] was gone away and he goes into the
[57:17] kitchen and he said there stood my
[57:19] little wife 37 years old gray-headed
[57:21] holding her hands crying Billy I'm just
[57:23] going to lose my mind the children
[57:25] haven't had a bite to eat all day begins
[57:27] to describe the events of the day and
[57:28] this person needing prayer and this
[57:29] coming and that happening just how the
[57:31] day got away from she says I don't know
[57:33] what to do there sat Becky and Sarah on
[57:36] the floor fussing over some little
[57:37] blocks Sarah screaming at the top of her
[57:39] voice daddy Becky's got my blocks daddy
[57:41] she took my pocketbook a while ago
[57:44] Joseph sat on the floor beating on
[57:46] something as hard as he could the little
[57:48] boy screaming at the top of his voice
[57:50] anybody anybody say that sounds like
[57:53] home now you talk about home sweet
[57:57] home well I looked around I thought now
[57:59] there's just one thing to do we've got
[58:02] to change the
[58:04] situation so brother brandham grabbed
[58:07] his coat and went
[58:10] fishing he went to the The Greens Mill
[58:13] he went to the cave he first class
[58:16] ticket to Tucson and went on a hike in
[58:17] sabinaa Canyon he says we got to change
[58:20] this
[58:21] situation now those people there through
[58:23] the day so many through the night
[58:25] it does disturb the
[58:27] children so I said to My Heart Lord I
[58:29] want you to help
[58:31] me I'm just letting down to talk to you
[58:33] from the bottom of my heart tonight of
[58:34] some things that you don't have to tell
[58:36] everybody and this is what he's sharing
[58:38] to the church I'm I'm sharing some
[58:40] things with you that you don't have to
[58:41] tell everybody but I'm sharing this with
[58:42] you so I think this is very personal
[58:43] that he shares Lord you help me now to
[58:45] get upon me the holy spirit in such a
[58:48] way that it'll change the
[58:50] situation so begins to describe how that
[58:52] as he's praying put his arms around his
[58:55] wife oh sweetheart I really feel sorry
[58:57] for you Billy I don't believe I can hold
[59:00] that any longer I'm just going to go to
[59:02] Pieces Just look at this house yes
[59:04] that's right honey that's exactly right
[59:06] notice he doesn't say I can fix it right
[59:08] that's our Instinct and he said put her
[59:10] AR arm around her I know sweetheart and
[59:13] he's saying Lord quieten her now that's
[59:15] true he says but you know honey the
[59:16] other day I was in Louisville I saw one
[59:18] of those pretty little blouses one of
[59:20] those prettiest dresses and where was it
[59:22] she said but Billy no time to talk about
[59:24] blouses I kept my hand on her honey I
[59:27] tell you you've never seen such a pretty
[59:29] blouse well look I tell you what Let's
[59:32] do let's get supper right quick what
[59:34] we'll do is I'll take you and show it to
[59:35] you and I'll buy it for you oh that's
[59:37] nice of you Billy but oh I couldn't look
[59:39] at a blouse tonight oh just look at me
[59:41] but look honey if you'd ever see it I
[59:43] believe you'd want to buy it and he's
[59:44] saying his heart Lord quiet her holding
[59:46] her by the hand I told you put me on
[59:48] your apron I let me help you get supper
[59:50] put on the apron begin to chop some
[59:52] carrots and things you know going on
[59:55] after a while she began crying she began
[59:56] to quit crying I thought thank you Lord
[59:59] oh honey Isn't the Lord wonderful he's
[1:00:00] just so good kept talking to her
[1:00:02] changing that
[1:00:04] atmosphere he said he says now the only
[1:00:07] thing you have to change the
[1:00:11] situation if that can be done in a home
[1:00:13] it can be done in a church he says it
[1:00:15] can be done in a nation can be done in
[1:00:17] the whole world Amen it's the atmosphere
[1:00:20] that counts amen by whom by you if it
[1:00:25] can be done in your home it can be done
[1:00:26] everywhere else he talks about how in
[1:00:28] the atmosphere is how life comes forth
[1:00:31] under some kind of heat he said it's the
[1:00:32] atmosphere that counts he says and you
[1:00:35] make up that atmosphere with what you
[1:00:37] are inside of
[1:00:38] you that doesn't it doesn't necessarily
[1:00:41] mean it's just organic in the sense that
[1:00:43] you just kind of
[1:00:44] go I'm just going to radiate you know
[1:00:46] you come home kick the door down
[1:00:50] like what are you doing Aaron I'm
[1:00:52] changing the atmosphere
[1:00:55] by what's inside of
[1:00:56] me but no there's something inside of
[1:00:59] you with wisdom and Revelation and
[1:01:01] understanding you're saying God you need
[1:01:02] to give me wisdom in this situation
[1:01:04] reading the room and understanding
[1:01:06] things that take place and things that
[1:01:07] happen and so brother Bram says in
[1:01:09] another place he says try this at your
[1:01:11] home referring to the very same
[1:01:13] situation he says you tried this and if
[1:01:15] there ever was a home that's confused
[1:01:16] and torp as much as ours people from
[1:01:19] everywhere all over the world coming all
[1:01:20] the time day and night all hours brother
[1:01:22] Mike and musicians you could come he
[1:01:23] doesn't say that here I'm saying it now
[1:01:26] musicians come and I've noticed here
[1:01:27] some time ago my lovely little wife at
[1:01:29] 37 years old completely gray she stood
[1:01:32] between me and the public there's any
[1:01:34] Praises given to the Brandon family give
[1:01:35] it to her the telephone will one you
[1:01:37] wild day and night the house has been
[1:01:38] full all day I went out my little
[1:01:40] children little Sarah and Rebecca were
[1:01:42] fighting over some play blocks little
[1:01:43] Joseph and the baby sitting on the floor
[1:01:45] screaming to the top of his voice wife
[1:01:46] in the kitchen with her face bared in
[1:01:48] her hands weeping when I finally got the
[1:01:50] house emptied some in this room some in
[1:01:52] that room some in the basement I walked
[1:01:53] in I thought oh what a
[1:01:56] confusion she put her arms around Billy
[1:01:58] I'm going crazy I hav't been able to get
[1:02:00] the children any dinner sometime raging
[1:02:02] Maniac saying in reverent saying it
[1:02:04] reverently a bunch of some some Fanatics
[1:02:06] running back and forth through the house
[1:02:08] saying the Lord said this the Lord said
[1:02:09] I your manager the Lord said this just
[1:02:11] think of what he had to deal
[1:02:14] with now if the Lord wouldn't talk to me
[1:02:16] about that if he had something to say
[1:02:19] but you can't help it it's just in the
[1:02:21] human
[1:02:22] line his wife says children haven't had
[1:02:24] anything to eat I don't know what to do
[1:02:26] well I thought there's just one thing to
[1:02:27] do now I'm tired but I'm going to do
[1:02:31] this now heavenly father in my heart you
[1:02:34] help me to be what you would have me to
[1:02:37] be on this scene to me this is key you
[1:02:41] have me to be what you would have me to
[1:02:43] be on this
[1:02:45] scene here I am my husband I'm a father
[1:02:49] confusion chaos tension Madness and he
[1:02:55] has the wisdom and this is what he
[1:02:56] shares with us let's try this in our hes
[1:02:58] this is what he shares with us he says
[1:02:59] if you could do it in your home you can
[1:03:00] do it in a church do it in a nation
[1:03:02] could do it in the world your world and
[1:03:05] it starts by saying well Lord you make
[1:03:07] me to be what you would have me to be on
[1:03:11] this scene he hasn't even asked for the
[1:03:14] scene to change he just says you make me
[1:03:18] be what I'm supposed to be in the scene
[1:03:21] and that'll change what I'm
[1:03:22] seeing if you can change if you can make
[1:03:25] me what I'm supposed to be in the scene
[1:03:27] the scene will become what it ought to
[1:03:29] be I'll see the scene for what it is
[1:03:30] maybe I can use the scene For Your Glory
[1:03:33] maybe I'm seeing the scene wrong but if
[1:03:34] you can make me what I'm supposed to be
[1:03:36] in the scene I'll know how to approach
[1:03:38] it I'll know how to accept it I'll know
[1:03:39] how to address it I thought not if I
[1:03:42] could just get her quiet Sweetheart
[1:03:43] would you rush out to dinner with me oh
[1:03:45] I'd have to clean up the children you
[1:03:47] could hardly hear yourself think little
[1:03:49] Joseph just beating on the floor as hard
[1:03:51] as he could so I slipped over got on an
[1:03:53] apron put it around me and begin to help
[1:03:56] her honey you know what I saw the
[1:03:58] prettiest dress the other day just
[1:04:00] wanted to get it for you and it was in a
[1:04:01] certain city here close by we'll go get
[1:04:02] it and all the time of my heart praying
[1:04:05] Heavenly Father quiet this dear little
[1:04:08] woman we ought to live in a consoling
[1:04:10] soothing healing atmosphere is what he
[1:04:12] said we should live in with our hearts
[1:04:13] constantly in prayer with a deep love
[1:04:15] for every person we come in contact with
[1:04:17] why don't we start at
[1:04:18] home why don't we start at home having a
[1:04:21] deep love for everyone we come in
[1:04:22] contact with in the home you come in
[1:04:24] contact with him in the morning in the
[1:04:26] kitchen deep love right healing
[1:04:29] consoling this is what we ought to
[1:04:32] have he says I just put my arm around
[1:04:36] her her not knowing what I was doing
[1:04:39] sometimes I noticed the big distinction
[1:04:42] here he put his arm around
[1:04:45] her right he didn't Adam stand up for
[1:04:48] just for a second if you
[1:04:50] could he here you're probably tall
[1:04:53] enough to where you in the whole screen
[1:04:54] already
[1:04:55] but I'm taller than that don't no no no
[1:04:58] no let's make everybody think I'm 6'2
[1:05:00] here he put his arm around it right but
[1:05:03] you know what sometimes our instinct is
[1:05:06] honey you need to calm down right we
[1:05:08] want to put hands on thank you for that
[1:05:10] right we want to lay hands on her right
[1:05:13] honey you're about to catch some hands
[1:05:15] if you don't chill
[1:05:16] out check yourself before you wreck
[1:05:19] yourself and he said no why don't you
[1:05:21] just put just put his arm around her
[1:05:25] and he
[1:05:27] says oh you know in it's heart oh quiet
[1:05:30] this
[1:05:31] woman her not knowing he says I was
[1:05:34] projecting creating a dis different
[1:05:37] atmosphere he was being what God wanted
[1:05:39] him to be in this
[1:05:41] scene I this may seem anti-climatic to
[1:05:43] you you might say oh man we built a
[1:05:45] whole Kingdom series up to this moment
[1:05:47] yes yes because this is where it
[1:05:50] matters listen if I can't find peace
[1:05:54] here what's it going to mean for me in
[1:05:56] the
[1:05:57] Millennium if I can't know his love here
[1:06:00] how am I going to know it in the
[1:06:01] Millennium this is where it
[1:06:03] counts this is really really pays off
[1:06:07] here this is what we were seeing in
[1:06:09] perfect love the payoff is
[1:06:12] here he says I was projecting created a
[1:06:15] different atmosphere and he says walk in
[1:06:16] the love of God had Fellowship in a few
[1:06:18] moments she got
[1:06:20] quiet and then when she got quiet Sarah
[1:06:23] and Becky divided up the play blocks
[1:06:25] Joseph got something to play with and
[1:06:28] there was peace in the
[1:06:32] home he said what was it projecting
[1:06:35] love now I'm going to read it to you the
[1:06:37] way that it's
[1:06:38] transcribed the way that it was
[1:06:40] originally transcribed I'm just going to
[1:06:41] read it this way if you want to go look
[1:06:43] it up but to me it strikes me when you
[1:06:46] listen to it and and you see what
[1:06:48] brother Bram was saying here he said
[1:06:49] Lord you make
[1:06:51] me what you want me to be
[1:06:54] you have me to be you help me to be what
[1:06:58] you would have me to be on this scene
[1:07:01] and knows how brother B describes this
[1:07:03] he says they were
[1:07:06] mine now notice what he's taking
[1:07:08] ownership of he said they were
[1:07:11] mine my children my
[1:07:14] wife they were
[1:07:16] mine that's my
[1:07:19] home you gave it to me it's not just a
[1:07:22] house it's not the structure the house
[1:07:24] is one thing the home is what we make of
[1:07:27] it that's my
[1:07:29] home that's my children that's my wife
[1:07:34] he says and I was
[1:07:36] God hallelujah think of what he's trying
[1:07:40] to say you help me to be what you would
[1:07:43] have me to be I am your hands on Earth I
[1:07:47] am your eyes on Earth I am your voice on
[1:07:50] Earth as you are a God in heaven I can
[1:07:52] be the god in the whole
[1:07:54] as you are the God and the invisible I
[1:07:56] can be the God made visible they were
[1:07:59] mine my children my wife my home I'm god
[1:08:04] with the power to change the atmosphere
[1:08:07] if God will change the atmospheres for
[1:08:09] the eth day if you'll Purge the world
[1:08:11] for the Millennium then can I create a
[1:08:14] world create an atmosphere that I can
[1:08:17] live
[1:08:19] in and God he
[1:08:22] says and and maybe some other
[1:08:25] transcription says and I was
[1:08:27] God's speaking of
[1:08:29] ownership but I think you could see it
[1:08:31] in any any of these lights how brother
[1:08:33] brah was
[1:08:34] becoming what he was supposed to be in
[1:08:36] that
[1:08:37] scene he says then God given his spirit
[1:08:39] and through that spirit with love to my
[1:08:43] family Sol and Grace come in and quied
[1:08:46] the family it'll do
[1:08:49] it I know it
[1:08:51] will amen we might might have to dig
[1:08:54] past our own human
[1:08:57] nature we might have to do it but I pray
[1:09:00] to God you start feeling that impulse
[1:09:02] amen that creative
[1:09:04] impulse that power to create a world and
[1:09:07] live on it I hope it begins to pulsate
[1:09:10] and beat so the next time that fussing
[1:09:12] and stewing and arguing and agitation
[1:09:15] and all the things that cloud the
[1:09:16] atmosphere start coming around and
[1:09:18] you're like oh you oh oh okay you want
[1:09:21] to fight let's do this right and
[1:09:23] whatever it might be that you start to
[1:09:25] get your Gander up a little bit you get
[1:09:26] triggered in whatever situation it is
[1:09:28] you begin to feel you feel that pulse of
[1:09:30] creativity rise up within you and say no
[1:09:32] no no no no no no no I'm going to create
[1:09:35] an
[1:09:35] atmosphere a and listen my advice would
[1:09:38] be to do what brother Bram did begin to
[1:09:40] pray quietly in your spirit Lord help me
[1:09:42] to be in this scene what you want me to
[1:09:44] be and not get religious Satan I rebuke
[1:09:49] you look at me when I'm talking to you
[1:09:50] woman Satan I rebuke you no it's
[1:09:54] atmosphere changing that's just going to
[1:09:55] make it
[1:09:56] worse it's atmosphere changing you don't
[1:09:59] even have to verbalize it but there's
[1:10:02] something emanating from you God given a
[1:10:05] spirit through that spirit with love for
[1:10:07] the family Sovereign Grace can come in
[1:10:10] and change the atmosphere the mouths of
[1:10:13] lions were stopped because the
[1:10:15] atmosphere changed the fire of the
[1:10:17] Furnace could not burn because the
[1:10:18] atmosphere changed listen Leo DEA is
[1:10:21] going to keep marching on but we can
[1:10:24] change the atmosphere we live in we can
[1:10:26] live in a bright age Kingdom we can live
[1:10:29] in the atmosphere of faith we can live
[1:10:31] in the atmosphere of deliverance we can
[1:10:33] live in the atmosphere of Supernatural
[1:10:36] expectation we can live in a world of
[1:10:38] perfect
[1:10:40] Faith because as Jesus Christ was able
[1:10:44] to it's what he
[1:10:46] was that's what we are and we can live
[1:10:49] in it I I I want you to go just be
[1:10:52] Kingdom Builders the right
[1:10:55] kind and live deliberately with purpose
[1:10:59] in your own homes starting there in your
[1:11:01] own individual lives to challenge
[1:11:03] yourself the next time an atmosphere is
[1:11:05] created even if you live by yourself the
[1:11:06] next time an atmosphere is being
[1:11:08] created sense that Kingdom Life inside
[1:11:11] of you that tells you and you say Lord
[1:11:14] help me to
[1:11:15] be what you would have me to be in this
[1:11:20] scene stand with me
[1:11:22] today
