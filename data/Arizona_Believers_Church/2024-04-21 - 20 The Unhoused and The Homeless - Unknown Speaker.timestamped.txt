[0:00] we are just advancing further in the
[0:02] subject of the house of the Lord and
[0:06] some of these things that God expresses
[0:08] here in these verses 7- 15 are just so
[0:10] beautiful how that he will build them a
[0:13] house and they'll be settled and they'll
[0:15] be at peace and just some really
[0:17] beautiful principles expressed there but
[0:20] my my title today and I'm really going
[0:22] to need your help as we speak on this is
[0:24] the unhoused and the homeless and even
[0:28] the image that we have here to me is
[0:30] conveying something and expressing
[0:32] something and if you kind of looked at
[0:34] it and tried to process it even analyze
[0:35] it as a work of art uh you might begin
[0:38] to identify maybe even some of the
[0:40] emphasis that I want to use today but as
[0:43] you consider this this phrasing the
[0:46] unhoused and the homeless I will just
[0:48] kind of take you on a sociology lesson
[0:50] maybe just for a few minutes this might
[0:52] seem to be uh uh you know maybe some
[0:55] political buzzwords uh but I want to
[0:57] draw on any knowledge and experience you
[0:59] might have with these terms just to
[1:00] teach something uh that I think will be
[1:03] a blessing and benefit to you but the
[1:05] how many have heard the term
[1:07] unhoused a few hands some nods all right
[1:10] then you're not you're not uh using CNN
[1:13] as your news source if you haven't heard
[1:15] it but the terms unhoused and how many
[1:17] have heard the term homeless right some
[1:19] of you might feel that way at times but
[1:21] these are uh two terms that I would say
[1:24] together taken together separately are
[1:25] the subject of some debate and we might
[1:28] associate the term unhoused as being uh
[1:31] kind of a the Progressive Movement or
[1:33] just kind of a a woke thing but they the
[1:36] term unhoused is simply used to uh
[1:39] Define for uh someone who lacks physical
[1:42] shelter so if they're unhoused they
[1:44] don't have maybe a uh a permanent place
[1:47] of residence a traditional fixed Abode
[1:50] and the this is just where I'm getting
[1:52] in some of the background and I'm doing
[1:54] this just to help us all be on the same
[1:55] page when I use these terms uh the to
[1:58] use the term unhoused the reason why
[2:00] some have began to use this phrase
[2:03] hasn't necessarily made it into our laws
[2:05] and into government programs but there's
[2:07] this movement and uh those who provide
[2:09] certain assistance and things uh those
[2:11] who are activists in this area of
[2:13] homelessness they use the term unhoused
[2:15] because they want to remove the stigma
[2:17] that's associated with the term homeless
[2:20] and if anyone has ever been unhoused or
[2:23] homeless you know understand kind of the
[2:25] ideas that people may have when they say
[2:27] oh I'm homeless I'm living on the street
[2:28] or I'm living out of my car
[2:30] and many times when people use the term
[2:32] homeless it conjures up these ideas of
[2:34] some sort of personal failures or
[2:35] weaknesses uh maybe bad choices or
[2:38] addictions things along that line and
[2:41] when the reason that someone doesn't
[2:42] have a house is simply because there's a
[2:44] lack of affordable housing and everyone
[2:46] that lived in Phoenix said
[2:48] amen or there's just there's certain
[2:50] circumstances beyond their control and
[2:52] it's not just associated with some sort
[2:53] of individual wrong and so they use the
[2:56] term unhoused just to remove everything
[2:58] else from the picture and only say this
[3:00] is someone who doesn't have a house
[3:02] instead of maybe saying homeless that
[3:04] might bring together some ideas of of
[3:08] these personal failures now when we use
[3:10] the term homeless it was tra
[3:12] traditionally meant to convey the same
[3:14] thing that someone didn't have a uh
[3:16] traditional housing they didn't have a
[3:17] fixed place of permanent residence an
[3:19] address that they could call home or
[3:21] that they could return to but kind of in
[3:23] the modern Evolution the term homeless
[3:26] kind of brings in this bigger picture of
[3:28] a a person's mental state of the choices
[3:31] they've made in Life or their character
[3:33] and and and again if you say well we
[3:35] have a homelessness problem or we have
[3:37] that's a homeless person you think of a
[3:39] maybe someone P panhandling on the
[3:41] street corner somebody who's not dressed
[3:43] properly and looks dirty and unshaven
[3:45] maybe a lot of things someone maybe who
[3:46] has a mental illness there might be a
[3:48] lot of things that we begin to think
[3:49] about and so it kind of supposes a
[3:51] personal weakness like I said maybe
[3:53] addiction or again a mental health issue
[3:56] but in the two uh maybe voices some that
[4:00] wanted to say well what's the why do we
[4:01] have to say unhoused or say homeless but
[4:04] really there's an agreement a general
[4:06] agreement among the people who debate
[4:08] this that someone can be unhoused but
[4:11] not necessarily homeless and this is
[4:13] where I start trying to you're I know
[4:14] you maybe in your mind you're already
[4:15] thinking where's this going did brother
[4:17] Aaron get kicked out of his house um but
[4:21] uh pray for me we are on a month-to
[4:23] month now so you never know what these
[4:24] landlords can do but there's a there's
[4:27] this General agreement that one could be
[4:29] unhoused in other words not have some
[4:30] sort of traditional place to live but
[4:32] yet not necessarily be considered
[4:33] homeless so they don't have an apartment
[4:36] they don't have a suite that they're
[4:37] renting they don't have a home or just
[4:39] renting or even owning but they they
[4:42] realize that they may have what one
[4:43] would call a home and I'm gathering this
[4:46] from the academics and from the activist
[4:49] and those who are very concerned about
[4:51] this space and dealing with these kind
[4:53] of issues and one of the original people
[4:57] I think was in Seattle that really began
[4:58] to use this term and it began to enter
[5:00] into the vernacular a little bit uh they
[5:02] were in this meeting at some sort of
[5:04] conference and they use the phrase uh
[5:06] these people are just unhoused because
[5:08] they have a home Seattle's their home
[5:11] and and they were looking at the sense
[5:13] of Seattle's where they belong this is
[5:15] their home they just don't have a place
[5:16] to live and so there's this idea that
[5:19] they may belong to or feel a part of a
[5:21] community they might have uh um sense of
[5:25] belonging uh Beyond just physical
[5:27] possessions and an address on a driver's
[5:29] license
[5:30] wherein uh they have a home because they
[5:32] have access to certain relationships and
[5:34] they have access to certain resources uh
[5:37] that make it more like home and provide
[5:39] the things that home should be providing
[5:41] so they kind of separated out the the
[5:43] physical structure of a house and all
[5:45] these other things that a person may
[5:46] need in their lives to feel important or
[5:49] or to make it through life or to succeed
[5:51] and they've divided that out that you
[5:53] could not have a house but still have a
[5:56] home now how many are really enjoying
[5:58] this riddle today
[6:00] and I feel like once I get into this
[6:01] next part uh when I I tried to explain
[6:04] it to my wife in 30 seconds without
[6:06] giving it all the way she was just like
[6:07] I'm I'm just really confused and I was
[6:10] like it's just too late to go back and
[6:12] try to figure this out again and so if
[6:15] you feel confused you know you're not
[6:17] alone and hopefully at least one other
[6:20] person tells you sister Elizabeth that
[6:21] they likewise are confused so you don't
[6:23] feel alone like if everybody's just amen
[6:25] and it's saying yes we get this and you
[6:26] start
[6:28] going don't do that
[6:30] maybe I will just make it a little
[6:32] convoluted but to use this term that you
[6:35] could be unhoused but not
[6:37] homeless if that could if that could be
[6:39] so it kind of suggests that there may be
[6:41] four potential states that someone could
[6:43] be in with respect to these things now
[6:45] I'll say this right now my the way God
[6:48] has inspired this began with the idea of
[6:50] uh maybe initially the idea of Truth and
[6:54] and when some people because we've been
[6:55] dealing with foundations that when
[6:57] someone begins to doubt truth that truth
[6:59] what if it was a personal truth a
[7:01] personal Viewpoint when you begin to
[7:02] doubt that truth your foundation begins
[7:04] to get shaken a little bit and when you
[7:06] start to have doubts you start to get
[7:08] uncertain about everything that's been
[7:09] built around that truth or that
[7:11] Foundation or that Viewpoint and I I've
[7:14] I've been thinking about those things
[7:16] and studying those things and it kind of
[7:18] was looking at the sense of having a
[7:19] vision a a and being forward-looking and
[7:22] proactive these are some ideas that have
[7:23] been in view so I want to my goal in
[7:26] looking at this and maybe this is just
[7:28] foundational uh and part one is to
[7:31] provoke a vision in your own life a a
[7:34] vision for your home and for your life
[7:36] that you would begin to seek after
[7:39] wisdom and desire better understanding
[7:42] of the word of God God's purpose for
[7:43] your life just uh begin to kind of roll
[7:46] up your sleeves a little bit and get
[7:47] serious uh not just about the word
[7:50] because in some ways we might kind of
[7:51] get theological that but get serious
[7:53] about life get serious about living get
[7:56] serious about your relationships and the
[7:58] things that you interact with the people
[7:59] that you have relationships with uh
[8:01] because there's uh we're we're living to
[8:04] leave and our leaving is going to be
[8:07] tied to that living and so we've got to
[8:08] take these things very seriously so I'll
[8:10] share these potential States and I was
[8:13] doing the math quite a bit last night
[8:15] just to make sure I wasn't just mixing
[8:16] up my A and B but if there's four
[8:19] potential States if you could be
[8:20] unhoused and homeless then let's just
[8:22] say that you could have house and home
[8:25] and that's uh you could be in that
[8:27] condition where you have the physical
[8:28] structure you have the Community you
[8:29] have the relationships or you can be
[8:32] unhoused and homeless as we've been
[8:34] saying the H the unhoused and the
[8:36] homeless where you have no house you
[8:37] have no home uh it's it maybe would be
[8:40] the worst so the best would be to have
[8:41] house and home the worst would be to be
[8:43] unhoused and homeless but just
[8:46] using and again I I'll acknowledge that
[8:48] maybe it could just be academic or or
[8:50] just semantics that if you could be uh
[8:53] unhoused but not
[8:55] homeless then it's uh then you could you
[8:58] could be in that situation where you can
[9:01] be without a house but still have a home
[9:03] then I want to propose or say it this
[9:05] way then you could have a house or you
[9:08] could have be homeless but not
[9:10] unhoused right in other words this and
[9:14] this has been what I've been proposing
[9:15] all along right you can have a house but
[9:17] not a home you could be homeless but
[9:20] have a house uh a place that you return
[9:24] to and a a place that you have an
[9:25] address and a place that you feel that
[9:27] you say that you belong but really when
[9:29] you begin to strip away uh or try to
[9:31] identify the things that really make
[9:32] something home you'd say oh well this is
[9:34] just a house it's never been put and
[9:36] embroidered and hung up in someone's
[9:38] house house sweet house right it's home
[9:42] sweet home it's not apartment sweet
[9:45] apartment it's not basement sweet sweet
[9:48] sweet basement site right it's it's uh
[9:51] it's a it's an idea that home is a place
[9:54] that has is beyond an address Beyond a
[9:58] physical structure
[9:59] and so if you could have house and home
[10:01] that would be ideal you could have be
[10:03] unhoused and homeless you could be
[10:06] unhoused and not homeless as the maybe
[10:07] the academic suggests and if that's true
[10:09] then I believe that you could have a
[10:11] house but not have a
[10:13] home in 2 Corinthians chap 5: 1 to6 I'm
[10:17] use this just to kind of refer to the
[10:18] idea of house and home and these
[10:21] different states that might exist and
[10:23] you may be in a state where you have
[10:24] house and home but yet there's a more
[10:26] perfect uh place that you desire and
[10:29] there's this transition out of house and
[10:31] home into another house and home says
[10:34] for we know that if our Earthly House of
[10:35] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[10:37] building of God so we have an Earthly
[10:39] house but then he says we have a house
[10:42] of God a house not made with hands
[10:44] Eternal in the heavens so you have a
[10:47] house on Earth you have a house in
[10:48] heaven and then he describes it this way
[10:51] for in this we groan earnestly Desiring
[10:53] to be clothed upon with our house which
[10:55] is from Heaven if so be that being
[10:58] clothed we shall not be found naked for
[11:00] we that are in this Tabernacle do grown
[11:02] being burdened not for that we would be
[11:04] unclothed or unhoused but clothed upon
[11:07] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[11:09] life now he that had wrought us the
[11:12] selfsame thing as God who also hath
[11:14] given unto us the earnest of the spirit
[11:17] therefore we are always confident
[11:19] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[11:21] the body we are absent from the Lord so
[11:24] it says we are at home in the body it it
[11:26] it's still kind of drawing of this idea
[11:28] of a house this of a house but now he's
[11:31] saying that we who are in this body do
[11:34] grown to not be here but not that we
[11:37] would be un our soul would leave and be
[11:39] unhoused and the Soul find its home in
[11:42] heaven but not have a house and say no
[11:45] it wants to also have a new body a
[11:47] glorified body because and now he says
[11:50] while we're at home in the body in other
[11:51] words our soul has is at home in this
[11:55] house now but yet it still is not at
[11:59] home with the Lord in heaven so it's I
[12:03] think in this scripture it says that you
[12:04] can have the soul is at home in the body
[12:08] the body is just a house and that when
[12:10] it the soul leaves that house though
[12:13] it's at home and belongs here now it
[12:15] groans and desires to be in its Heavenly
[12:18] home and when it makes it to its
[12:19] Heavenly home it's not going to be
[12:21] unhoused it's going to be housed in
[12:23] clothe the pond it's can have a new
[12:24] Tabernacle a new body that is a glorious
[12:27] body a glorified body liken unto the
[12:29] Lords so there is a body for the soul
[12:32] now and it's at home in this world but
[12:35] yet longs to be at home with the Lord
[12:37] because it says but now we are absent
[12:39] from the Lord because we're going to our
[12:41] Heavenly Eternal home and that would be
[12:44] to me this idea an expression of having
[12:47] house and home that if we are if when we
[12:51] die and our bodies um go into the ground
[12:55] then we are waiting we are at home but
[12:58] yet unhoused in that in that theophany
[13:00] waiting to be clothed upon to have that
[13:03] glorified body raised up so you can see
[13:05] this idea that there's these states that
[13:06] one can be in that is not a death
[13:10] sentence or something's wrong but like
[13:12] you we want to ultimately have that
[13:14] permanent fixed unchangeable House of a
[13:17] glorified body but now as we live in
[13:19] this world uh we're not necessarily
[13:22] uncomfortable in our skin and we're not
[13:24] say and we're not just wanting to die so
[13:27] that this body dissolves but we say
[13:28] while I'm here in this world my soul has
[13:30] a home in this body and I'm housed the
[13:33] Lord has given me flesh he's clothed me
[13:35] but one day I'm going to move I'm going
[13:37] to I move to a new house and I'll be at
[13:40] home there
[13:41] too so there's an idea of the house and
[13:44] home working together so then there's as
[13:47] I said you could be you could have no
[13:49] house and no home and that would be a um
[13:52] it' be if I could say this it' be the
[13:53] state of one who's
[13:55] lost and if you have no house and you
[13:57] have no home that would be the worst
[13:58] possible POS scenario but let me let me
[14:01] just look at this idea of being unhoused
[14:05] but not homeless as that's kind of what
[14:07] the the uh activist might say is that
[14:11] let's not call him homeless if we're
[14:12] going to call him homeless call him a
[14:13] homeless person so we think of their
[14:15] humanity and and that they're an
[14:16] individual but unhoused it's like well
[14:18] they just don't have a place that they
[14:19] live but yet they have a community they
[14:21] have a sense of beling and purpose so as
[14:24] we look at 1 Chronicles chapter 17
[14:27] verses 1 to6 and let me just say this
[14:29] stick with me I Believe by God's grace
[14:31] the gift Will Make Way for itself and
[14:34] get and get to something for you today
[14:36] in first Chronicles 17: 1-6 says now it
[14:40] came to pass as David sat in his
[14:43] house that David said to Nathan the
[14:46] prophet lo I dwell in a house of Cedars
[14:48] this is a uh this is not just a tent
[14:51] this is not something you take the
[14:52] stakes down and roll up and move to the
[14:54] next lot this is something that is
[14:56] permanent it has
[14:57] foundations and he brings this contrast
[14:59] but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[15:02] where the Lord promised to meet and
[15:03] where his presence was remaineth under
[15:05] curtains so it I live in a house this is
[15:08] living he lives in a tent now if that
[15:11] doesn't kind of conjur up the image of a
[15:13] a homeless encampment or a a homeless
[15:15] shelter or unhoused circumstance here's
[15:18] David living in a house and the Lord
[15:21] unhoused but then Nathan said unto David
[15:24] do all that is in thine heart for God is
[15:25] with thee and it came to pass the same
[15:28] night that the word of the Lord came to
[15:29] Nathan saying now think think of how God
[15:31] characterizes himself go and tell David
[15:34] my servant thus sayith the Lord Thou
[15:36] shalt not build me a house to dwell in
[15:39] so David you're not going to build me a
[15:40] house now that would have come as some
[15:42] maybe hurt to David and that's why he
[15:44] begins to encourage him and speak to him
[15:47] kindly he says then he says for I have
[15:50] not dwelt in a house since the day that
[15:52] I brought up Israel unto this day and he
[15:55] acknowledges but I have gone from tent
[15:58] to tent
[15:59] and from one Tabernacle to another when
[16:02] it says tent to tent and Tabernacle to
[16:04] Tabernacle it says I've gone um from
[16:06] place to place I've moved ever since
[16:09] we've come out of e Egypt I've moved but
[16:11] then he says wheresoever I have walked
[16:14] with all Israel so I've been with you
[16:16] I've been among you and I've been living
[16:18] in a tent but I haven't had a house
[16:22] spake i a word and now and what he's
[16:24] saying is as long as I went from tent to
[16:26] tent and from Tabernacle to Tabernacle
[16:28] and was walking with you did I ever at
[16:30] any one time say to any of the tribes of
[16:33] Israel it says judges but it's speaking
[16:34] of this idea of tribes whom I commanded
[16:36] to Feed My People saying why have you
[16:38] not built me a house of
[16:41] Cedars God lived in a
[16:44] tent he was traveling from one place to
[16:47] another but he never asked for a house
[16:51] and this is in God's own language David
[16:53] says I live in a house God doesn't live
[16:54] in a house but you'd say well he's
[16:56] amongst them he's with them' but yet it
[16:59] wasn't considered a house as he said in
[17:02] Exodus 25:8 let them make me a sanctuary
[17:06] that I may dwell among them so despite
[17:09] the fact that God did not have a house
[17:11] or what David called This House of
[17:13] Cedars and this permanent Dwelling Place
[17:16] it was he was not
[17:18] homeless he walked amongst Israel he was
[17:22] dwelling in a
[17:24] tent and as we could say this the
[17:26] unhoused have no traditional fixed Abode
[17:29] they have no fixed resident it's not
[17:31] permanent that's not a it's not a place
[17:33] where they reside where you know you
[17:35] could send a a package to it and you
[17:37] could send them mail they don't
[17:39] necessarily have that and God could say
[17:41] the same thing that you never knew when
[17:42] it would move you never knew when it
[17:44] would transition it could at any moment
[17:46] be uprooted and change
[17:47] locations and so the unhoused they don't
[17:51] have the house that God's talking about
[17:53] but they may have God belonged among
[17:57] Israel and he said make me a sanctuary
[18:00] maybe it's not a house but it was a tent
[18:02] where he dwelt among them and this was
[18:05] his family this was a kingdom of uh
[18:07] Kings and Priests and this is this is
[18:09] who he dwelt amongst let me let me
[18:12] emphasize this because this is where the
[18:15] real uh maybe heart of what I'm trying
[18:17] to express to be homeless it means you
[18:20] have no sense of
[18:22] belonging uh it it's this lack of social
[18:25] connections the lack of emotional
[18:26] connections and and that's in this uh
[18:30] I'm trying to think of it's you know the
[18:31] social economic sense or
[18:34] sociology and the psychology of it that
[18:36] if someone's homeless it conveys the
[18:38] idea that they don't have relationships
[18:40] they can depend upon they don't have
[18:42] these emotional connections that maybe
[18:44] human beings thrive on and they need to
[18:46] function properly and that couldn't be
[18:48] said of God he wasn't
[18:49] homeless uh but yet he didn't have a
[18:52] house and so when David desired to build
[18:55] the Lord a house he wasn't having pity
[18:58] on someone that was homeless or God
[19:00] without a position and God without a
[19:01] belonging but the temple was to be his
[19:03] house and his home it was the house of
[19:06] the Lord it was the home of the Lord
[19:08] because it was now going to find its
[19:10] place where it belonged on that that uh
[19:14] uh that rock the foundation stone the
[19:17] threshing floor of Ora it was going to
[19:19] find its permanent fixed above the place
[19:21] that God had envisioned all along the
[19:23] place that God was working to cuz now he
[19:25] wouldn't just be in the wilderness he
[19:26] just wouldn't be in some place but he
[19:28] would be in Palestine with his people in
[19:31] other words you could have built him a
[19:33] house in in Jerusalem on Mount Zion
[19:35] while the people remained in Egypt and
[19:37] he could have never called that a
[19:39] home even though it could have been a
[19:41] house but now is the time where he could
[19:43] have house and
[19:45] home so God had a house or God didn't
[19:49] have a house to prior to this point but
[19:51] he still had a
[19:53] home now if you could uh just by use of
[19:57] eyebrows or whatever you know subtle
[20:00] ways you want to say does that make
[20:01] sense enough to keep
[20:03] going okay good
[20:06] balcony okay all right it's just harder
[20:08] to hear
[20:09] you may maybe I should start doing on
[20:12] camera like this
[20:19] balcony now let's use the example this
[20:22] is now this is where it gets into just
[20:25] exactly where I hoping this could uh be
[20:27] some teaching for you let's look at the
[20:29] example of a local church what we call
[20:32] the house of the Lord a house of worship
[20:34] local church and then our act or are
[20:37] going to a church now this is not just
[20:40] in the sense of Any Given Sunday you use
[20:42] a randomizer and you just attend a
[20:44] church but this is the idea of there
[20:48] being a local church and that's the
[20:50] church you go to and so we're doing this
[20:52] to understand what it means to have
[20:54] house and home or to be un the unhoused
[20:56] and the homeless
[20:58] if I say this I'll say this if you stay
[21:01] at home and don't go to church then you
[21:02] are an unhoused
[21:04] Christian at the very least you're are
[21:06] an unhoused as a Christian brother
[21:08] brandham said it is wrong to stay home
[21:11] from
[21:13] church now you can try to have church in
[21:16] your
[21:16] home right but brother Bram says it's
[21:19] wrong to stay home from church it
[21:21] conveys this idea that there's a place
[21:23] that you go and if you don't have a
[21:26] place that you go you're unhoused as a
[21:28] Christian
[21:29] brother Bram says in the sermon God
[21:31] hidden himself in Simplicity a real
[21:32] mother wants to take her baby to church
[21:35] and that's the thing you should do well
[21:36] that's a good one to use right a real
[21:39] mother wants to see her children in
[21:41] church and she will take them to church
[21:45] and he said that's the thing that you
[21:46] should do this is what the messenger
[21:48] teaches about this church this phenomena
[21:51] of an actual structure with an address
[21:53] and a four walls and and a place where
[21:55] people meet it Con conveys this idea of
[21:57] some phys structure or meeting place you
[22:00] ought to go to church brother BR says
[22:02] then how can you stay home and be just
[22:05] as good as Christian as you would be a
[22:06] church you can't do it in other words he
[22:10] teaches and says it repeatedly if you
[22:12] think you could not have a church that
[22:14] you go to and be just as good as
[22:16] Christian as those that go to church
[22:17] you're wrong in other words those that
[22:20] go to church are by default better
[22:24] Christians than those that stay at
[22:27] home maybe be regardless of what you
[22:29] believe at home you can't be a good as
[22:32] Christian as those that at least go to
[22:39] church I wonder how many streamers we
[22:42] just
[22:43] lost that probably happened when I
[22:45] called out Lucas's
[22:47] outfit and brother bam is talking to
[22:50] somebody and he says the fellow said I
[22:51] can be a Christian and stay home just as
[22:53] well he says no you can't no you've got
[22:56] to meet together with the rest of of the
[23:00] body says in another place people say I
[23:02] can stay at home be just as good as
[23:04] Christian as I can at church you can't
[23:08] right yes understanding better what it
[23:11] means to press play and
[23:14] Obey I can stay at home and be just as
[23:16] good good as a Christian as I can at
[23:18] church he says you can't brother random
[23:20] often refers to Hebrews chapter 10: 25
[23:22] not forsaken the assembling of ourselves
[23:24] together as the manner of some is so
[23:28] even in Paul's day even in the early
[23:30] Genesis of the church there were those
[23:32] who did not go to church and he's kind
[23:34] of calling them out that there's some
[23:36] that don't assemble they have their own
[23:37] ideas their own Traditions they have
[23:39] things that they do but they don't go to
[23:40] church he says but we should not forsake
[23:43] the Gathering Together the meeting
[23:44] together as a church as some might
[23:46] forsake he says but we come together to
[23:49] exhort but exhorting one another as so
[23:51] much the more as you see the day of
[23:53] approaching it it carries with it this
[23:56] idea that church is not just a matter of
[23:58] attend end in but it's a matter that my
[24:00] presence is a part of exhortation that
[24:03] when I go to church I am a source of
[24:05] encouragement and virtue to somebody
[24:06] else and that cannot be provided when I
[24:09] stay at home and so if you've got to
[24:11] look at it this way that you're so
[24:13] important that we all need you okay be
[24:16] here come but then also if you invert it
[24:20] you realize that if I stay at home I'm
[24:23] missing out on a scriptural Avenue of
[24:26] exhortation that's to encourage me and
[24:28] strengthen me and that's why I can't be
[24:30] a good as Christian as those that go to
[24:32] church cuz I'm missing a scriptural
[24:34] source of my
[24:37] encouragement I'm missing a scriptural
[24:39] source of being provoked to loving good
[24:41] works as he continues to speak in verse
[24:44] 26 brother brandham says in what Visions
[24:47] are he says we feel that every person is
[24:50] Duty bound to attend some church and
[24:52] belong to some church as a
[24:55] Christian many people say oh I stay home
[24:57] and read my Bible I'm just as well off I
[24:59] stay at home and listen to mp3s or tapes
[25:02] he says and that was me sorry that was
[25:04] just me he says oh I stay at home read
[25:06] my Bible I'm just as well off no the
[25:08] Bible said we shouldn't forsake to
[25:10] assemble ourselves together he says in
[25:13] the voice of the sign after the seals he
[25:15] says we believe that every Christian
[25:17] ought to have a home church that they go
[25:19] to every Christian ought to meet
[25:21] somewhere with Believers and wherever
[25:23] you meet that's the church so it can't
[25:26] be church if it's not a meeting place
[25:30] okay so let me say this there could be
[25:31] some churches that meet in a
[25:33] house and if it's Believers gathered
[25:36] together scripturally around the word of
[25:38] God and the way that it's uh set up and
[25:40] identified in the scripture that's where
[25:41] the original churches were meeting in
[25:44] the New Testament Church but he says we
[25:45] ought to have a home church so we don't
[25:48] judge a gathering just because it
[25:49] doesn't have a traditional Church
[25:51] structure say oh well they're just
[25:52] meeting in a trip Center are they oh
[25:54] they're they're written in Old Catholic
[25:56] Church they're in AEL hotel room who
[25:59] does that right or okay a hotel
[26:01] conference room that might make more
[26:03] sense right so is it a queen Suite um
[26:07] but they get wherever they gather
[26:08] brother Bram identifies this this is the
[26:10] this is the meeting place this is what
[26:11] makes it a church he says and trying to
[26:13] do God of service without it being his
[26:15] will God's will he says I'm so
[26:17] misunderstood and I don't know why this
[26:19] is going to be really important here in
[26:20] a moment when we get to question and
[26:21] answers he says I'm so misunderstood and
[26:23] I don't know why people think I don't
[26:25] even believe in go people going to
[26:27] church that's a million miles from the
[26:30] truth it was a million miles from the
[26:32] truth November 27th 1965 and it's just
[26:35] the same today it's a million miles from
[26:38] the truth if people believe that brother
[26:40] bandam taught you should stay
[26:43] home he said in one place and those who
[26:46] do not go to church were trying to get
[26:47] them to go to
[26:50] church there was nothing in brother
[26:52] brenham's message that should cause a
[26:55] light bulb to go on and say oh I I I can
[26:57] stay at home
[26:58] now so if I could summarize that portion
[27:01] with this a Christian should have a
[27:04] house of
[27:06] worship they should have a church
[27:08] house the place where they go to church
[27:10] someone says where do you go to church
[27:12] like oh well it just depends you know
[27:14] just kind of whatever I feel but there
[27:16] should be a place that said this is
[27:18] where this is where I go to church in
[27:20] question and answers part one brother
[27:22] bandam has asked this question I think
[27:23] it's the very next week he's asked a
[27:25] very similar question and uh in answers
[27:28] in a very similar way but just was
[27:29] running out of of space brother brandham
[27:32] should we go to other churches even when
[27:34] they disagree with
[27:36] you who wants to answer this for him
[27:39] sure
[27:43] yep should we go to other churches even
[27:45] when they disagree with you brother
[27:47] brandom is asked by women or sisters
[27:50] whose husbands go to different churches
[27:52] that disagree with brother brandham and
[27:54] he says should I go to church with my
[27:55] husband he's like yeah
[27:58] I don't think he says it that way but he
[28:00] essentially says yes right yes you
[28:03] should go what do you have to worry
[28:05] about sister you can't be deceived go
[28:07] support your do what a wife should do do
[28:09] what a Christian lady would
[28:10] do and so here he says sure yep Jesus
[28:14] did when they disagreed with him go
[28:16] ahead he says we notice here should we
[28:18] go to other churches and disagree with
[28:19] you sure says I'm not only the only
[28:22] Pebble on the beach you know there's
[28:24] just other Godly men everywhere I hope
[28:26] I'm one of them and I think he means
[28:28] this this isn't false humility and yet
[28:31] we could not argueing or disagree with
[28:33] brother Ram was like yeah you're not
[28:35] you're not the only PEB on the beach but
[28:37] you're the only Prophet who showed up to
[28:40] this generation right this is we
[28:42] wouldn't belittle his ministry then he
[28:45] identifies something very interesting I
[28:47] was called in on something like this the
[28:49] other day a group in Arizona called my
[28:51] attention to that and it's listen if you
[28:53] study the message on the spirit that
[28:55] exists in Tucson and Phoenix and Arizona
[28:57] you'll find there was a very particular
[28:59] Spirit amongst the pastors and the
[29:01] churches and it had a lot to do with who
[29:03] goes to church and who goes where and
[29:05] whether or not people would leave and uh
[29:07] and it's a spirit that still exists
[29:08] today he says a ministerial group said
[29:11] the only thing that we have against you
[29:12] brother brandham he says is one of the
[29:15] things so if you've created some
[29:18] narrative in your mind that when brother
[29:20] Brandon was here preaching that no one
[29:21] disagreed with them and nobody took
[29:23] fault with what he taught and and the
[29:25] people who are doing it today have lost
[29:27] or you know it's too late they did it
[29:28] then don't hide behind some idea
[29:30] thinking that he was with that nobody
[29:32] accused him of anything everyone agreed
[29:33] with him nobody withstood him they
[29:34] questioned him then and so it doesn't
[29:36] stumble us to find that there's people
[29:38] who are disagreeing with them even then
[29:40] because then you realize oh these
[29:41] Spirits are always the same it's not
[29:43] something new he said one of the things
[29:45] they disagreed with him on is the people
[29:46] that comes out here with you we can't
[29:49] get them to go to church
[29:52] anywhere they got children and
[29:54] everything and they won't go to
[29:56] church this is this is I I this
[29:58] ministerial group was not being shallow
[30:01] they had a legitimate concern that
[30:03] people who are following a very Dynamic
[30:05] scriptural Ministry but yet they could
[30:07] identify a very unscriptural Trope in
[30:10] their lives something they're doing
[30:12] where they don't go to church even when
[30:14] they have kids it's like what do they
[30:17] why do they expect to happen to their
[30:19] children if you just think of how God
[30:22] used church used organizations and used
[30:25] certain things through the church ages
[30:26] and even in the evolution up to the word
[30:28] coming forth and a prophet coming on the
[30:29] scene where was he preaching in churches
[30:32] and where did they hear this truth in
[30:34] churches and and through these
[30:36] traditional structures in these houses
[30:38] and that's how they came to the Lord and
[30:39] now they want to have this idea that
[30:41] once they've heard the prophet's voice
[30:43] they're going to stay at home but yet
[30:45] not provide the same framework that God
[30:48] used to get to their
[30:50] hearts and somehow just by some magic
[30:52] message Seance that they call the token
[30:55] and it's more like the toen that they're
[30:57] trying a wave over people it's just a
[30:59] fiction thinking that they're going to
[31:01] get saved by
[31:07] osmosis and said well we told them they
[31:10] were welcome to come to our church and
[31:13] then brother bam acknowledges something
[31:14] here I think it's very fantastic he says
[31:17] I know they put a pressure on you and
[31:18] want you to join so brother B's looking
[31:21] at it even in the sense of denominations
[31:23] and and the way churches can be they can
[31:24] be real churchy and pushy and there
[31:26] could be you know you need to make your
[31:27] decision that this is your church right
[31:29] it could be could be a lot of pressure
[31:31] so only put pressure on you want you to
[31:32] join and even for a denomination that's
[31:34] a little bit more uh you know you have
[31:36] to sign things or maybe you have to work
[31:38] within certain parameters he says but
[31:40] you don't have to
[31:42] join but put them kids in Sunday school
[31:46] somewhere and you go to church don't set
[31:50] it home go fishing and
[31:53] hunting wait did he say that don't he
[31:57] means don't set at home don't go fishing
[32:00] don't go hunting but it says go fishing
[32:03] and
[32:05] hunting says don't sit at home go
[32:07] fishing and hunting and things like that
[32:08] on Sunday you say well I'm not a
[32:10] legalist mm if is that not the spirit
[32:14] well we're not going to be legalists
[32:16] brother Aaron we're more message
[32:17] hipsters we're not going to cram it down
[32:20] our children's throat that's what
[32:21] happened to us right I'm not a legalist
[32:23] well you better be in that manner for a
[32:25] while dishonoring the resurrection of
[32:27] Christ
[32:28] you go to church somewhere so he's
[32:30] saying if you're going to be a legalist
[32:31] at least be a legalist about going to
[32:33] church you might feel like you're just
[32:35] living in Liberty and this is freedom
[32:37] now and I don't have to go to church
[32:39] he's saying oh my goodness if anything
[32:41] be a legalist about that going to church
[32:44] somewhere now if we take away from this
[32:47] what he's expressing even if you're not
[32:49] fully aligned with the church and I know
[32:51] this is this is hard stuff to chew on
[32:53] there's a lot to consider in this but
[32:55] this is the idea of not being
[32:59] unhoused that you may not be fully
[33:03] agreeable to the church you may not be
[33:04] in harmony with the leadership it you
[33:06] may not fully engage he says don't join
[33:09] but yet you go you attend and in Any
[33:11] Given Sunday or even maybe in that
[33:13] midweek you find yourself at this church
[33:15] and you find yourself there but you say
[33:17] well we had we don't baptize that same
[33:20] way or they don't really serve a full
[33:21] Loa whatever it might be and you might
[33:24] have uh disagreements and there may just
[33:26] be like we're never going to full
[33:28] integrate there might even be a feeling
[33:29] in your heart that this isn't these
[33:31] aren't people that I want my children to
[33:33] intermar with uh and so there's this
[33:36] realization and again I realize that I'm
[33:37] kind of cracking open a door on a very
[33:40] complex issue but yet brother brandom's
[33:43] approach it from the standpoint of man
[33:44] you've got to honor the word of the Lord
[33:46] don't stay at home that it's a bigger
[33:48] danger ground to stay at home this is
[33:51] hard for me to say it's bigger danger to
[33:54] stay at home than it would be to go to a
[33:55] church that you don't fully agree with
[34:01] wow and I I trust that you have enough
[34:05] of a foundation in the word of God to
[34:07] where that's you're not taking that the
[34:09] wrong way so he he continues in
[34:12] answering this he says if you can't come
[34:13] here at the Tabernacle get some church
[34:16] somewhere go to
[34:18] it if you don't have to take you don't
[34:21] have to take all they do so it's this
[34:23] understanding that yeah we may not agree
[34:25] with everything they do they may baptize
[34:26] this way they may teach this I don't
[34:28] necessarily agree with their teaching on
[34:29] this I don't necessarily agree with
[34:30] their understanding of that he says you
[34:32] don't have to take all they do what part
[34:34] of the bread they're serving you serve
[34:37] the bread when they got the garlic why
[34:39] you just leave it alone I know some
[34:41] people are thinking garlic I'll take it
[34:44] right with some of us like
[34:46] garlic he said that's right sure you go
[34:48] to church but again what ises he
[34:49] conveying if you can't get a full loaf
[34:51] get a get a slice if you go to a church
[34:53] and they're serving something that you
[34:56] don't want to partake in then then he
[34:58] just spit the seed out you don't have to
[35:00] partake on that and I know that that
[35:01] lends itself to this Dynamic where you
[35:04] better have a strong home life to when
[35:06] you come home with your children say I
[35:08] know they're teaching this and I know
[35:09] they're teaching that and we respect the
[35:11] man of God and we respect their
[35:12] understanding and God shows people what
[35:14] they can they got to stay true to their
[35:15] calling if that's the way the Lord LED
[35:17] them let's stay true let's not be
[35:18] critical let's not run things down but
[35:20] as for me in my house this is what we
[35:21] see in the word and this isn't maybe the
[35:24] church we want to be in but we need to
[35:27] be in church
[35:29] church and he's saying this is
[35:31] especially important to young children
[35:33] that's why I admire these young families
[35:36] that sacrificed to bring their children
[35:38] to church even on Wednesday nights when
[35:41] these kids need to be in bed right about
[35:42] the time the song service is ending and
[35:45] somebody got a peek of the slideshow and
[35:47] realized brother brother Aaron has 120
[35:49] slides in his deck they're thinking when
[35:51] are we going to get out of here right
[35:53] but they still do it and then the core
[35:55] of it in their heart is I want my child
[35:57] even though he may only be 2 years old
[35:59] or maybe my my daughters may be at a
[36:01] young age I want them to know that this
[36:02] is important this is something we do and
[36:05] there's a benefit in doing it kids eat
[36:09] free he says that's right sure go to
[36:12] church wherever the church door opens
[36:14] you take off as hard as you can
[36:16] go if they don't believe well you don't
[36:19] have to
[36:20] partake and again he says don't join
[36:23] them don't join any of them churches but
[36:25] go to them I hope you understand there's
[36:28] this difference of just attending a
[36:29] church and going to the church but they
[36:31] saying there's not there's not a joining
[36:33] that takes place there's this not this
[36:34] connection or this harmony but go to
[36:36] them fellowship with them so there's a
[36:38] difference in fellowshipping and joining
[36:40] and in you this Union how do you know
[36:42] that it's not the
[36:43] Lord he said he'd make everything work
[36:46] together for the
[36:48] good it may only be a church house but
[36:52] you need one you listening you're
[36:54] following me you may it may only be just
[36:57] a church house but he's saying you've
[36:59] got to have
[37:02] one one can have a House Church but not
[37:05] a church
[37:07] home one could have this church house
[37:10] experience but not a church home and
[37:12] this is where I I think I've dealt with
[37:14] the one side now let's look at this
[37:16] other side because brother R is saying
[37:17] go go you ought to go to church just
[37:20] because you haven't found the perfect
[37:21] church does not justify you to stay
[37:26] home but now I want to identify this
[37:29] attitude that how some people L
[37:31] themselves to sleep by thinking it's
[37:33] just enough to be
[37:36] housed as I've been studying the the the
[37:39] etymology or as brother Andrew would say
[37:42] the Endocrinology or something like that
[37:45] of the word homeless it's very
[37:47] fascinating Shakespeare even uses the
[37:49] term unhoused in aell am I getting that
[37:53] right and and and so there's this uh the
[37:56] term unhoused May even not
[37:58] unfamiliar and even the the term of
[38:01] homelessness or homeless for the in the
[38:03] United States has a lot to do with the
[38:06] Industrial
[38:07] Revolution and and the onset of
[38:09] non-agrarian communities and things like
[38:11] that to where the concept and idea of
[38:13] maybe cities and this gather of a lot of
[38:15] different cultures and things was not
[38:16] broadly uh uh pervasive and so it began
[38:20] to really take shape in the United
[38:22] States this is in our vernacular and
[38:24] since I'm speaking uh in America we'll
[38:26] use this that kind of after the Civil
[38:27] War a homeless was used to describe
[38:30] these itinerant Tramps and that term
[38:33] is maybe a word that was used who
[38:34] were traveling around seeking work and
[38:38] so they would just kind of hop on trains
[38:39] they travel around the carpet baggers or
[38:41] whatever they might have called them
[38:42] they would just move around looking for
[38:44] work so they wouldn't have a base or a
[38:47] home and they were seeking work but the
[38:50] issue why they called them Tramps and
[38:53] itinerant the issue was not I hope you
[38:55] catch this the issue is not the fact
[38:57] that they they didn't have a farm or a
[39:00] house or a place you could send a letter
[39:02] the initial emphasis was on this and
[39:04] this was written uh uh in a book I was
[39:06] reading the loss it was the emphasis was
[39:08] on the loss of character and a perceived
[39:12] emerging moral crisis that threatened
[39:15] long-held ideas of home life rather than
[39:17] on the lack of a permanent
[39:21] home in other words they weren't
[39:24] judging these men because they didn't
[39:27] have a house they were judging them
[39:29] because they were forsaking the home
[39:31] life they weren't judging them because
[39:33] they didn't have a ranch and they didn't
[39:35] have a picket fence and they didn't have
[39:36] a permanent address it was more of a a
[39:39] lack of character and it was a moral
[39:42] issue where they had kind of become uh
[39:45] untethered from
[39:47] responsibility and could just live foot
[39:49] loose and fancy free and just get enough
[39:51] money and get enough work for the time
[39:53] and then move on to the next place and
[39:54] there was no real accountability there's
[39:56] no real uh uh um
[39:58] responsibility and so the concern this
[40:01] is I hope this starts to get kind of
[40:02] heavy hitting journalism now the concern
[40:05] wasn't the lack of a house but the
[40:07] concern was what was in the person's
[40:08] heart the concern was the motive and
[40:11] objective the lack of relationships the
[40:13] lack of accountability the lack of
[40:15] responsibility the lack of uh teaching
[40:17] in their life or the lack of being a
[40:18] teacher as they ought to be the issue
[40:20] wasn't the lack of a house the issue is
[40:22] a lack of a vision and purpose right
[40:25] amen now when this this to me this will
[40:27] be the part that hopefully becomes this
[40:30] this turn of momentum and things start
[40:31] to click today our solution for
[40:34] homelessness is to provide
[40:38] housing you you following me today when
[40:41] we begin to identify the problem of
[40:42] homelessness we begin to think we need
[40:45] to find them a house we need to build
[40:48] affordable housing we need to provide
[40:50] structures where they can live we need
[40:51] to give them a place that they can call
[40:53] their own but in the 19th century in the
[40:55] early 20th century when this become kind
[40:57] of an epidemic the answer was not
[41:00] providing them a place to live the
[41:01] answer was PR providing them a job and
[41:03] cultivating a work ethic the idea was to
[41:07] give them some sense of ownership over
[41:09] some sort of idea this is what I do this
[41:11] is who I am this is how I can make a
[41:14] living you didn't just give a guy a
[41:16] house you gave him a
[41:19] job the idea of creating a
[41:22] purpose given a basis for a vision for
[41:26] tomorrow
[41:27] if I just hop on a train and go work for
[41:29] some guy picking weeds in his field or
[41:31] doing something then is when that job's
[41:33] done I begin to think well I don't know
[41:34] exactly where I'm going to be tomorrow
[41:35] maybe I'll talk to another another
[41:37] itinerate worker I'll talk to one of
[41:39] these guys and we'll figure out where we
[41:41] go to next and there was this idea and
[41:43] this concept has been very fascinating
[41:44] for me to read about it of this new kind
[41:47] of masculinity and this
[41:49] manliness of of this worker and this
[41:51] traveling where he could just be this
[41:53] Maverick and go around anywhere he
[41:55] wanted to and there was this grave
[41:58] concern over this attitude because
[42:01] though they might have been
[42:03] working some would say oh we we need to
[42:06] give them a house they didn't have a
[42:09] vision they didn't have a commitment
[42:12] they weren't willing to stick things out
[42:14] and make things work and build a
[42:16] testimony just well this whole boo came
[42:17] over and did this and he's
[42:19] gone so the idea was give them a vision
[42:22] give them a purpose homelessness was
[42:24] viewed as a crisis of men reading this
[42:27] verbatim from this religious group at
[42:29] the time a crisis of men let loose from
[42:32] all the habits of domestic life
[42:34] wandering without aim or
[42:39] home
[42:40] wow men let loose from all the habits of
[42:43] domestic life there's a brand of
[42:45] so-called Christianity Christianity
[42:47] Today that wants to put the entire
[42:49] responsibility domestic life on the
[42:53] wife no responsibility at all a crisis
[42:57] of men let loose from all the habits of
[42:59] domestic life wandering without aim or
[43:02] home oh they might have jobs they might
[43:05] be working they might be making a living
[43:06] they might be surviving but they've lost
[43:08] the vision they don't have aim they
[43:10] don't have Direction they don't have a
[43:12] place that they come back to they don't
[43:14] have a sense of home so to them the idea
[43:17] when they begin to look at this problem
[43:18] in the late 19th century early 20th
[43:20] century that's the 1800 and the early
[43:22] 1900s when they begin look at this
[43:24] phenomena they weren't like oh no they
[43:26] need a house they were oh no the these
[43:29] guys need a
[43:31] vision the critical Factor then that I'm
[43:33] identifying in being unhoused or
[43:35] homeless or both is the lack of a vision
[43:38] the lack of
[43:40] purpose to be homeless is to have no
[43:42] place no position no purpose there's no
[43:45] sense of belonging there's no
[43:48] worth and so you could the let's not
[43:51] think so much of the issue is the house
[43:53] the issue is the
[43:55] home a Christian may choose to stay home
[43:59] and I think we've read enough statements
[44:00] today and I didn't even read all of them
[44:03] I'm not going to say are you proud of me
[44:04] I would say isn't that amazing that
[44:06] there's
[44:07] more Christians may stay at home and
[44:10] choose to be unhoused message Believers
[44:13] may choose to stay at home and not have
[44:16] a church house they go to that is
[44:19] wrong that is
[44:22] wrong but churches May provide a house
[44:24] for some Christians but not provide a
[44:31] home and there's a real danger when we
[44:33] focus on just being
[44:36] housed because religion is no substitute
[44:39] for
[44:41] relationship being able to have a house
[44:43] is not
[44:44] enough so we say oh well they're
[44:46] unhoused I have a house it's not enough
[44:49] to just have a house because again the
[44:52] epidemic and the problem wasn't the lack
[44:54] of structure it was a lack of vision
[44:56] like of understanding of what this is
[44:58] for brother Brandon begins to identify
[45:00] us to us some of the importance of the
[45:01] house that you are in because he says
[45:03] don't join them don't don't get in
[45:05] League with them be understanding of
[45:07] where you're going and where you're
[45:08] visiting where you feel that you're a
[45:09] part of you call that your church but
[45:11] realize if it's not exactly what you
[45:13] believe and what you should be a part of
[45:15] you're never actually get fully
[45:17] comfortable right put your feet up treat
[45:19] act you know my house your house be like
[45:21] ah I don't know about that cuz if it was
[45:24] my house we wouldn't be serving that
[45:27] right what happens when you visit
[45:28] someone's house when they serve
[45:29] something like oh I do not like oysters
[45:30] but here we go right cuz you show that
[45:34] respect and so there's something about
[45:36] realizing I'm not in my own home but yet
[45:39] you have this house as a church so we
[45:41] cannot substitute being
[45:43] housed for finding
[45:46] home religion is no substitute for
[45:48] relationship and the sermon discernment
[45:50] of spirit I think we've read this before
[45:52] maybe a couple times we might read it
[45:54] every Sunday and I just forget says you
[45:55] ought to have a place not just to float
[45:58] about from Pillar To Post now I want to
[46:00] come back to that phrase here in a
[46:01] little bit from Pillar To
[46:04] Post but have somewhere where you go to
[46:07] church and you call it your church
[46:10] somewhere where you pay ties and
[46:13] somewhere that you help support the
[46:16] cause that's more I think it's more than
[46:18] having a
[46:19] house take your choice but then don't
[46:22] ever disfellowship the other man because
[46:24] he doesn't belong with your group
[46:27] so it's this idea where now you identify
[46:29] with it I've chosen this church house
[46:32] but I support their cause I pay my ties
[46:35] I'm not this is somewhere where I call
[46:38] it my
[46:40] church you've I'm sure we've met
[46:41] somebody or maybe we've been that person
[46:43] before we say well um where where do you
[46:46] go to church and say well I go to such
[46:48] and such church but it's not really my
[46:49] church but that's where I go that's not
[46:52] a foreign
[46:53] concept now let me just interject this
[46:56] draw a pair parallel to your home
[46:58] life and think of how that you might
[47:01] have all the trappings of a traditional
[47:03] life a wife children or spouse and
[47:06] children you have a mortgage you have a
[47:08] rent you have a place you live you have
[47:09] an address you have a home life but
[47:12] really when you begin to look at it's
[47:13] really just a house life you may Simply
[47:16] Be housed together and not a
[47:20] family you may be sharing the same
[47:22] address and sharing the same milk and
[47:24] cereal and and and you might all say
[47:26] well this is this is my family this is
[47:28] my house but yet it's not really a home
[47:31] I know this has just been a real simple
[47:32] theme that we've been carrying for quite
[47:34] some time in our church but I'm wanting
[47:36] to present it in a language we
[47:37] understand we could have the
[47:39] pretense and it's just a house so we
[47:43] don't have the stigma of being unhoused
[47:45] but really when you begin to dig down
[47:46] into it this person has a house but
[47:49] they're homeless but John give me that
[47:51] title slide again and and maybe they
[47:53] could begin to look at it this way
[47:57] this is what some people are in their
[48:00] Church they've got pewes they've got
[48:02] Pulpit they've got four walls they've
[48:03] got song leading they got song service
[48:06] but that's what they are they're curled
[48:08] up on the floor homeless they're a
[48:11] beggar in their church house cuz they're
[48:14] not getting bread and all that's served
[48:15] is garlic they become a beggar in church
[48:19] they become homeless in the church
[48:23] house I wish I was a preacher
[48:28] now in the sermon Christ is a mystery
[48:29] God revealed thank you brother John now
[48:31] think of the the feeling that is being
[48:34] conveyed in this statement when brother
[48:36] bram's given a word to the church to the
[48:37] Tabernacle the enemy will come and when
[48:40] he does just cling that much closer
[48:43] together and the one that the devil is
[48:46] using for an enemy will either get out
[48:48] or come in and be one of
[48:50] you I think of it think of it this way
[48:53] what if you're the
[48:54] one that is going to the church
[48:57] that you don't quite agree with the
[48:59] devil may want to use you to be an
[49:04] enemy and you don't ever want to be the
[49:06] tool of the
[49:07] devil and so there's this this
[49:10] interesting Dynamic where he says you
[49:12] don't do that where where there's a
[49:14] where there's the dynamic of this
[49:16] opposition he's saying to a church come
[49:18] cling together and that one that's
[49:20] trying to divide you he'll either
[49:22] eventually become a part recognize the
[49:24] air of his ways believe or it'll be a
[49:26] means that where they
[49:27] leave I I I know I'm just it's a tight
[49:30] rope for me may God help me may you give
[49:31] me just have some Grace for me if my
[49:33] wording uh has been a little bit sloppy
[49:36] I just pray that God uh doesn't allow
[49:38] the devil to misuse some of these things
[49:41] he says don't never Clan among one or
[49:44] talk and make yourself clannish we are
[49:46] one so don't let the the body be
[49:49] bifurcated and separated he said I
[49:51] couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you
[49:52] I'm going to take you away cuz you're
[49:53] not a right hand he's my left hand I
[49:56] want him to stay there even the little
[49:59] tip of my finger I want to stay right
[50:02] there every little part of my body stay
[50:04] right there and God wants us as a body
[50:07] of Believers to stay right exactly with
[50:09] one another right at with one another
[50:12] what he's conveying to those at brandom
[50:14] Tabernacle is not this idea that we're
[50:17] the closest church I know this is just
[50:19] convenient I know that you're all a
[50:20] bunch of Methodist that don't want to
[50:21] cross the bridge to go into Louisville
[50:23] and no it was this idea that we're in
[50:25] this together we see things the same way
[50:27] there's a there's a nurturing and a
[50:28] cultivating relations amongst another
[50:30] and I know you've got the tapes on that
[50:32] you got tapes on what we believe and the
[50:35] tapes say go to church you got tapes on
[50:38] discipline in the church how we behave
[50:40] ourselves in the Church of God how we
[50:42] got to come here together and sit
[50:43] together in Heavenly places don't stay
[50:49] home if God is in your heart you can't
[50:51] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[50:53] yonder and to get in here to fellowship
[50:54] with your brothers I believe it was
[50:57] brother Bernie Garcia that used this was
[50:59] used this in his teaching he used this
[51:02] to is very very good brother Christian
[51:04] was fing with me on this very good
[51:05] teaching because if you study half hour
[51:07] to church and where did Brother BR nail
[51:09] this down so much where you have this
[51:10] idea well brother Bernie had a very
[51:12] excellent way of teaching this he said
[51:14] he talks about being a half hour early
[51:16] and the and he talks about the doors
[51:17] opening a half hour early that that's
[51:19] Church order doors open a half hour
[51:21] early and he says as soon as the doors
[51:22] open what does he say you want to get
[51:25] there I think that's good I think that's
[51:27] good teaching he says if you don't feel
[51:30] that way I tell you it's time you got to
[51:32] pray
[51:33] in cuz we're in the last days where the
[51:36] Bible exhorted us much more as we see
[51:37] the day
[51:39] approaching okay so you understand now
[51:41] that this that this and again maybe just
[51:43] hearkening back to the way brother
[51:45] Garcia taught it is that if the doors
[51:47] open a half hour early if you love the
[51:50] Lord and God is in your heart when the
[51:52] doors open you want to be there so we
[51:54] should we have this idea and this desire
[51:56] I want to be there when the door is open
[51:58] and there's a great benefit and blessing
[51:59] from that 30 minutes brother B even
[52:01] teaches us how that that pre-service
[52:03] ought to be and so he says that this is
[52:06] what we ought we ought to long to come
[52:07] together and now listen to the language
[52:08] he's using as much more as we see the
[52:11] day approaching to love one another with
[52:13] Christian love and divine Love This Is
[52:15] Not Mere Association this is not just
[52:17] being
[52:18] housed to assemble ourselves together in
[52:20] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love
[52:22] one another this will all men know that
[52:24] you are my disciples when you have loved
[52:26] one for the other that's right stay
[52:28] right together if the brother you think
[52:30] he's a little wrong or sister say Lord
[52:32] don't let me never have the root of bit
[52:34] spring up because it'll affect him and
[52:37] it'll take the Christ right out of my
[52:39] life that poison acids of malice and
[52:41] jealousy and hat that'll just take the
[52:43] Holy Spirit right away from you it'll
[52:45] run him from the Tabernacle here here
[52:48] it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it
[52:50] away from here hurt your pastor it'll do
[52:52] everything don't you do
[52:54] that listen don't be worried about
[52:56] hurting me don't be worried about
[52:59] offending the holy spirit because here
[53:01] I'll say this what ought to hurt the
[53:04] pastors when the spirit of the Lord is
[53:05] driven away not when you offend his
[53:07] sensibilities or his opinions or have a
[53:10] disagreement with him when we act in a
[53:12] way that offends the Holy Spirit and he
[53:14] goes away that's when a pastor should be
[53:16] hurt not just because someone disagrees
[53:18] with what he preaches I've had people
[53:20] that I admire and love very much tell me
[53:22] I don't agree with everything that you
[53:24] preach but yet they still are inow ship
[53:27] and there's still and you're all
[53:27] thinking isn't everybody that way about
[53:29] him but there's you don't always have to
[53:32] see eye to eye and that shouldn't hurt
[53:33] the pastor just because you see
[53:35] something a little bit different but
[53:36] when we act in a way that drives the
[53:38] Holy Spirit
[53:39] Away oh my that's what hurts the pastor
[53:44] don't you do that just wax that much
[53:45] closer together take the Buckle as the
[53:47] brother testified a minister here the
[53:48] other night having the Buckle seeing it
[53:50] in a vision that buckles on the whole
[53:51] armor of God just pull her on tighten up
[53:53] move right up close to one another love
[53:55] one another
[53:57] talk nice about one another talk nice
[53:59] about one another talk nice about one
[54:02] another so the tape is skipping talk
[54:03] nice about one
[54:05] another love one another anyhow talk
[54:07] nice about one another say nice things
[54:09] about one another and then God will
[54:11] bless you you want to know why you're
[54:13] missing out on some blessings because
[54:15] you don't say nice things about
[54:19] others then the sermon blind bottom
[54:22] is oh there's just now listen this all
[54:25] right let me I'm going too
[54:29] fast he's describing something totally
[54:32] different in Christ as the mystery God
[54:34] revealed than really what he's
[54:35] describing in question and answers the
[54:37] next summer would you agree this idea
[54:40] that someone's going to church and yet
[54:42] it's not they don't completely feel a
[54:44] part of it that's the kind of church if
[54:46] all of a sudden there was a problem and
[54:48] things begin to get heated and there was
[54:49] sin and brothers are doing it'd be a
[54:51] situation where like we need to find a
[54:52] new church like this isn't I I can't
[54:55] fight these battles
[54:56] that there's this teaching that goes
[54:58] against the word of God and we've been
[54:59] here we've been a part of it and all of
[55:00] a sudden think this isn't where you go
[55:02] well I guess we better kind of join up
[55:03] together with it that might be a sign
[55:05] that something needs to change but here
[55:07] it's a different sense it's a different
[55:09] feeling like no this is what I'm a part
[55:10] of that the enemy is attacking this we
[55:12] need to kind of draw close together we
[55:14] need to buckle up this is a time of War
[55:16] this is a time of battle so brother
[55:18] Brandon makes this statement in 1955
[55:20] there's just plenty of good churches
[55:21] around through here you can go to so be
[55:23] sure of all the fine churches you ought
[55:25] to find one one is somewhere and you
[55:28] find a church
[55:31] home and go in and tell them that you
[55:33] want to become a member of their body of
[55:36] Believers now the language he's using
[55:38] prior that we' read even though he's
[55:40] using it later in his ministry it's this
[55:42] idea of go but don't join you're not
[55:43] really going to become a member you're
[55:44] not going to be fully
[55:46] invested but he's saying now you should
[55:48] find there's plenty of churches to go to
[55:50] but find one that you can call home find
[55:53] one that you can call a church home tell
[55:55] them you want to support it you want to
[55:56] be there and if I could draw the
[55:59] parallel for home life for brother says
[56:00] you got to make your home Happy Where
[56:02] Your Children want to be there and where
[56:04] they would be happy to bring their
[56:05] friends and Associates too there so it's
[56:07] turning a house into a home where even
[56:09] your children like hey I want to bring
[56:10] my friends over is it okay if I have my
[56:12] friends over why they're proud of it and
[56:15] so church should be a home where you're
[56:17] happy to bring
[56:19] others if you are going to a church
[56:22] where you're not happy to bring others
[56:24] if you attend a church where you
[56:25] wouldn't invite or send others then you
[56:28] have a church house not a church home
[56:30] and let me applaud you and I I'm looking
[56:33] at at a church full of people who
[56:34] consider this their Church home but let
[56:36] me just speak to the spirit I applaud
[56:38] someone who has a house but I encourage
[56:39] you to know you can have more than a
[56:41] house you can have a home because if
[56:42] you're going to a church that you're not
[56:44] willing to welcome people to and invite
[56:46] people to and tell them about it and if
[56:48] you're not going to be there you should
[56:49] go anyways I'm going to be out of town
[56:50] but you should be in church you should
[56:52] be there you should be there you should
[56:54] take a step back and realize I may not
[56:56] be unhoused but I'm still
[57:03] homeless so
[57:05] now well I mean if I stopped here I'd
[57:07] have plenty for Wednesday night too and
[57:09] I wouldn't I could go fishing maybe
[57:11] Wednesday I don't
[57:14] know so let me say this from tent to
[57:16] tent as the Lord said of
[57:18] himself is different than what brother
[57:21] Ram said from Pillar To
[57:24] Post I want you to think about that
[57:27] because I think it's important to kind
[57:28] of identify these these a theme that
[57:32] what really what's issue if we get very
[57:34] legalistic we just say well they need to
[57:36] find a church and they just need to
[57:38] stick there and they just need to
[57:38] support it they just need need quit
[57:40] moving right and they're legalistic
[57:42] about it and they're more legalistic
[57:44] about the structure right than they are
[57:47] about God's vision and plan and purpose
[57:49] of a house of
[57:50] worship so there's a difference in going
[57:53] from tent to tent
[57:56] and and going from Pillar To
[57:58] Post if you want to look at 2 Chronicles
[58:02] 16:9 this is a good aspect ra show
[58:05] here it says for the eyes of the Lord
[58:08] run to and
[58:10] fro throughout the whole earth in other
[58:12] words the eyes of the Lord roam the Lord
[58:14] roams throughout the whole earth and he
[58:16] does it to show himself strong in the
[58:19] behalf of them whose heart is perfect
[58:21] toward him so this is this
[58:23] characteristic of the Lord his eyes roam
[58:25] he's roaming to and fro throughout the
[58:27] whole
[58:28] earth this you could characterize God as
[58:31] roaming the Lord roams throughout the
[58:33] Earth but he shows himself strong he's
[58:35] doing this to show himself strong on
[58:37] behalf of them whose heart is perfect
[58:38] toward him now as it's already been
[58:40] expressed in Chronicles the Lord was
[58:42] unhoused but he had this work and this
[58:45] Vision to bring Israel to the promised
[58:47] land and then as we read in those
[58:49] subsequent verses not just to give them
[58:50] a place that they could call their land
[58:53] but to place them in it so they could
[58:55] dwell comfortably and be free from their
[58:58] enemies and call it their own this is
[59:00] we're not just living within the borders
[59:02] but this has become our home so he was
[59:05] roaming and traveling tent to tent but
[59:07] he had intent the whole time to bring
[59:10] them to a perfect position and placing
[59:13] to establish themselves permanently in
[59:15] the promised
[59:16] land if I could borrow a phrase this
[59:19] might be from tolken not all who Wonder
[59:21] are
[59:23] lost and the idea that is expressed in
[59:26] that is just because you see somebody
[59:27] moving
[59:29] about doesn't mean and it may seem that
[59:31] they're roaming doesn't mean they're
[59:33] lost doesn't mean they don't have a plan
[59:36] doesn't mean there's not a purpose in
[59:37] what they're doing that there they you
[59:40] could all of a sudden you see a Shepherd
[59:42] wandering off like there's your sheep
[59:44] why does he keep wandering off he's
[59:46] going to find the one right there's
[59:48] different things that that may be happen
[59:50] in this Viewpoint and and I'll say this
[59:53] and and I say this as a caution to some
[59:57] of our our legalism because we're
[59:59] legalist about going to church but we
[1:00:01] shouldn't be legalist just about going
[1:00:02] to this
[1:00:04] church and and so just because you see a
[1:00:09] circumstance or
[1:00:11] situation where someone has moved either
[1:00:13] they Chang churches multiple times or
[1:00:14] maybe they move locations it doesn't
[1:00:17] mean that they're it doesn't mean that
[1:00:19] they are
[1:00:20] lost does well they're just
[1:00:24] homeless and and well they're unhoused
[1:00:27] or they're homeless and we start to use
[1:00:28] these just as phrases to try to define a
[1:00:29] certain person's characteristic no God
[1:00:33] was unhoused in
[1:00:35] roaming God was unhoused in traveling
[1:00:39] but he was doing it with a
[1:00:41] vision proverb 29:18 where there is no
[1:00:44] vision the people perish but he that
[1:00:46] keepeth the law happy is he the vision
[1:00:49] is a revelation from God it's to know
[1:00:50] his will it's that I'm following his
[1:00:52] will if we come up with some sort of
[1:00:54] metric that just choose a church and
[1:00:55] stay there then God's will may be for
[1:00:57] someone to change a church or to move
[1:00:59] somewhere else and we've immediately
[1:01:01] created a framework that binds people to
[1:01:03] the
[1:01:04] house and not in the leadership of the
[1:01:06] Holy Spirit right we have to have a
[1:01:09] vision without the vision the people
[1:01:10] scatter without a vision that people
[1:01:12] live undisciplined unrestrained lives so
[1:01:15] listen the problem with someone going
[1:01:17] from tent to tent is when it's from
[1:01:19] Pillar To Post in when it's without a
[1:01:21] vision it's not in the perfect will of
[1:01:23] God and without that Vision they're just
[1:01:25] constantly making mistakes and they're
[1:01:26] undisciplined and
[1:01:28] unrestrained what I'm what I my heart is
[1:01:30] inditing in all this is that we must
[1:01:32] have a vision as men we ought to have a
[1:01:34] vision that as husbands we ought to have
[1:01:36] visions as families we ought to have
[1:01:38] visions for our lives individually all
[1:01:39] of you male and female you ought to have
[1:01:41] a vision for your life you got to have
[1:01:42] purpose we have the vision for our
[1:01:45] family where we have a revelation that
[1:01:47] is purposeful and forward-looking not a
[1:01:51] revelation that looks back to historical
[1:01:54] facts of fulfillment of scriptures or
[1:01:56] looks back to Vindication but a
[1:01:57] revelation that looks forward to Destiny
[1:02:00] a forward that looks I missed an is a
[1:02:03] destination we're looking forward by
[1:02:05] Revelation it gives us purpose it gives
[1:02:07] us a vision to walk
[1:02:10] in otherwise without a vision you may be
[1:02:13] unhoused and you may be homeless you may
[1:02:15] be
[1:02:16] both because it says he that keepeth the
[1:02:19] law through that Divine Oracle and
[1:02:22] Revelation he's
[1:02:23] happy so if you do not have a Vision you
[1:02:26] may have a house but you're still
[1:02:27] homeless you're not happy it's not a
[1:02:29] happy
[1:02:32] home you're unhappy
[1:02:34] unsuccessful without Vision that's when
[1:02:37] you're lost in
[1:02:39] wondering even if you manage to plant
[1:02:41] yourself in one
[1:02:51] place I'm I'm going to keep pushing
[1:02:54] further here because I really feel that
[1:02:56] this needs to be emphasized
[1:02:59] together this difference between from
[1:03:01] tent to tent I'm I'm wanting to
[1:03:03] acknowledge that God can lead a person
[1:03:05] in a way that to you looks like they're
[1:03:07] Meandering but as long as they're
[1:03:08] following in God's perfect will who are
[1:03:11] we to say and sometimes we get that
[1:03:15] attitude and somebody ends up in a spot
[1:03:18] and you just see him moving around you
[1:03:19] say man you just need to sit down you
[1:03:20] just need to settle down you just need
[1:03:21] to stay here what if it was Disobedience
[1:03:23] that got them where they are
[1:03:26] and because you don't properly equip
[1:03:28] them you just build them a house just
[1:03:30] house them we you need to stop being on
[1:03:33] house give them a house but it's like no
[1:03:34] the issue wasn't the house the issue is
[1:03:37] the vision the
[1:03:40] character the the the the this moral
[1:03:44] crisis so I that's a that's I hope you
[1:03:47] can see that that uh there's this Nuance
[1:03:51] there that we need to be very sensitive
[1:03:52] to because what's most important is
[1:03:54] following the leadership of the Lord
[1:03:57] in job chap 1:7 the Lord said unto Satan
[1:03:59] whence comest thou and the and then
[1:04:01] Satan answered the Lord and said from
[1:04:03] going to and fro in the earth and from
[1:04:05] walking up and down it in it in other
[1:04:08] words he says I'm
[1:04:10] roaming the eyes of the Lord roam to and
[1:04:12] fro the eyes of the Lord is roaming now
[1:04:15] Satan himself is roaming but he's
[1:04:17] roaming seeking whom he may destroy he's
[1:04:20] roaming with the purpose of corruption
[1:04:21] he doesn't have a higher purpose his
[1:04:24] purpose is merely selfish
[1:04:27] his idea isn't to build up his idea is
[1:04:30] is not what is best what promotes what
[1:04:33] cultivates what would further the will
[1:04:34] of God he's going from Pillar To Post
[1:04:37] and when brother benam says that you
[1:04:39] just float about from Pillar To Post and
[1:04:41] he says many statements about this
[1:04:42] wandering and straying and going about
[1:04:45] it's it conjures up this idea of those
[1:04:47] that move repeatedly from one place or
[1:04:50] position to another usually in a hurried
[1:04:52] or disorganized way which results in
[1:04:55] suffering or at least
[1:04:58] inconvenience to be go from Pillar To
[1:05:00] Post conveys the idea of being tossed
[1:05:02] around without a clear purpose so
[1:05:05] someone could be going from place to
[1:05:08] place but they're not tossed they're
[1:05:10] moved they go from tent to tent but this
[1:05:13] is not uh without Vision this is not
[1:05:15] without purpose this is not selfishness
[1:05:18] this isn't just chasing a carrot this is
[1:05:20] the very deliberate move of God this is
[1:05:22] God working in their lives and God being
[1:05:23] Sovereign in everyone's lives but there
[1:05:25] is a habit and there is a way of living
[1:05:27] and there's even this we talk about
[1:05:29] Wonder lust where there's just this
[1:05:30] untethered from responsibility and from
[1:05:33] home life and accountability and they
[1:05:35] just always moving around a person
[1:05:37] always just going around it's hurried
[1:05:39] it's disorganized it's not with
[1:05:41] vision brother Bram says and many of the
[1:05:44] poor people wondering straying children
[1:05:46] straying around the world tonight
[1:05:49] without a church
[1:05:51] home Grant Lord that they'll see their
[1:05:53] air and come to the house of the Living
[1:05:55] God
[1:05:57] I'd like to just add uh my emphasis
[1:06:01] today that we see people straying even
[1:06:04] when they have a house because their
[1:06:07] Spirits aren't at
[1:06:08] home their lives Meander and they stray
[1:06:11] they might come always come back to the
[1:06:12] house their church but their lives do
[1:06:15] not have the trajectory of the Holy
[1:06:17] Spirit it it's that cycle of deep
[1:06:19] valleys and and maybe moments of of
[1:06:22] Revival based upon certain circumstances
[1:06:24] or even the calendar but they don't have
[1:06:26] that real overcoming and that real
[1:06:28] exhortation and virtue that they ought
[1:06:30] to have in their life he's saying Lord
[1:06:31] may they find those that are poor and
[1:06:33] wondering and strain
[1:06:35] children find a church home and see the
[1:06:39] air see what's lacking see what's
[1:06:41] missing and come to the house of the
[1:06:43] Living God he says in the sermon
[1:06:45] expectation Save The Lost bring back the
[1:06:47] wandering sheep that's gone astray
[1:06:49] strain around over the country no church
[1:06:51] home no place to go like wanding stars
[1:06:55] know they ought to be in their father's
[1:06:57] house feasting and dying on the good
[1:07:01] things of
[1:07:02] God not
[1:07:04] picking not being
[1:07:06] selective right could you imagine the
[1:07:08] toll it takes on a family when you go to
[1:07:11] church day or Wednesday and Sunday with
[1:07:13] the idea of I don't know how much I'm
[1:07:15] going to be able to
[1:07:18] eat therefore we ought not to have this
[1:07:20] shallow idea but brother brandham said
[1:07:22] just be a legalist about going to church
[1:07:24] just have a house and if you can't get a
[1:07:26] whole loaf just get a slice listen
[1:07:28] that's a dynamic for bitterness it's a
[1:07:30] dynamic for or disappointment and stress
[1:07:33] and strain on a person's spirit because
[1:07:35] a person ought to have a house where
[1:07:38] they're feasting and dining on the good
[1:07:40] things of
[1:07:41] God not wondering sheep straining over
[1:07:44] the country no church home in Ephesians
[1:07:47] chap 4:14 then that we henceforth be no
[1:07:50] more children tossed to and fro and
[1:07:53] carried about with every wind of do by
[1:07:55] the slide of men and cunning craftiness
[1:07:57] whereby they lie in wait to
[1:08:00] deceive this characterization of
[1:08:02] children is that they're just kind of H
[1:08:04] uh uh
[1:08:07] impatient if you even look at in this
[1:08:09] sense children don't have to labor for
[1:08:11] the benefit of themselves or others
[1:08:13] there's laws against that but children
[1:08:16] are not expected to work or have a
[1:08:18] job children do not have a
[1:08:22] vision they do not have a determined
[1:08:24] course to stay on and sense uh there's a
[1:08:26] vision that a parent is trying to lay
[1:08:28] out and it takes discipline to get them
[1:08:29] to stay that course train up a child in
[1:08:31] the way that they should go but the
[1:08:32] child himself does not articulate and
[1:08:34] formulate a vision children are more
[1:08:36] moved by Pleasure uh the immature more
[1:08:39] moved by the dictates of the Flesh and
[1:08:41] the the momentary feeling that they're
[1:08:43] having so if I can say this that we
[1:08:44] henceforth be not immature tossed to and
[1:08:48] fro going from pillar to pulse roaming
[1:08:50] carried about even if it's just a wind
[1:08:52] of Doctrine or the slide of men or some
[1:08:54] sort of craftiness the immature
[1:08:56] are moved around as circumstances
[1:08:58] dictate right they don't bind themselves
[1:09:01] closer together they don't stick it
[1:09:03] out because they have no sense of
[1:09:05] belonging or
[1:09:11] home if we are only I I I I want to
[1:09:15] close I definitely want to close if
[1:09:17] we're only dictated by being housed we
[1:09:19] may forever be
[1:09:21] homeless if our only idea is I just want
[1:09:23] to have a place to go I just want to
[1:09:25] have a place then you can find houses
[1:09:27] all the time you can find jobs all the
[1:09:29] time you you you you'll just follow
[1:09:31] where that is there there's there
[1:09:33] sometimes maybe PE people may fleece the
[1:09:35] Lord and say well if I can sell my house
[1:09:37] and buy one there I know it's the Lord's
[1:09:39] will but you know sometimes there's
[1:09:40] markets that are such a case to where do
[1:09:42] that anywhere man just get a job if you
[1:09:45] can just find a job well I mean jobs can
[1:09:47] be had right so we realize there's got
[1:09:50] to be more to this than just being
[1:09:53] housed
[1:09:55] be we don't want to be iate tramped
[1:09:57] spiritually or even
[1:10:01] literally because life in Luke 12:23 the
[1:10:03] life is more than meat and the body is
[1:10:05] more than
[1:10:06] rainment God's kingdom is more than just
[1:10:09] finding food amen God's kingdom is more
[1:10:11] than just finding clothing God's kingdom
[1:10:13] is more than just finding
[1:10:16] work brother Brandman the sermon a time
[1:10:19] of decision he says sometimes today you
[1:10:22] want to find a place to put your
[1:10:23] membership someplace you want to go to
[1:10:27] church now listen and there's plenty of
[1:10:30] churches to go to there's plenty of
[1:10:32] forms of religion to go
[1:10:35] to sometimes I believe we even make the
[1:10:37] mistake of just kind of throwing a dart
[1:10:39] on a map in a sense and saying is there
[1:10:42] a message Church there good I'll have a
[1:10:46] house right come on let's be honest
[1:10:50] sometimes we're only we just want to
[1:10:51] make sure there's a message Church there
[1:10:53] and it's not is this is is this God's
[1:10:56] will right I I can remember this I I
[1:10:59] don't know if I've ever shared this
[1:11:02] testimony in this way but God in a very
[1:11:06] very Supernatural way he visited
[1:11:09] Elizabeth and I had breakfast and in I
[1:11:12] believe it was April in
[1:11:16] 2020 and we began to weep in the
[1:11:18] presence of the Lord and our hearts said
[1:11:23] basically God's calling us to Phoenix
[1:11:26] just completely independent of any kind
[1:11:27] of prompting it just happens and at that
[1:11:30] very moment is it okay if I say this
[1:11:33] Brother Scott Walker I we hadn't talked
[1:11:35] to communicated in a few years that very
[1:11:37] moment he texts me and he says I'm
[1:11:39] moving to Phoenix and I'll just
[1:11:41] summarize it and I kind of want your
[1:11:42] feedback on
[1:11:44] churches and I I remember that night
[1:11:47] when we got on the phone and we were
[1:11:48] talking he was sharing with me with just
[1:11:50] how supernaturally the Lord had opened a
[1:11:52] door for him to go to Phoenix I's like I
[1:11:54] know this is is God and without me
[1:11:56] telling him anything I just said well
[1:11:57] then you know God will
[1:11:59] provide right it's not just a matter of
[1:12:02] making sure you're housed but it's
[1:12:04] making sure you're not
[1:12:06] homeless it's knowing that a house is
[1:12:08] important but what's most important is
[1:12:10] that I'm in God's will what's most
[1:12:13] important is I have a vision that I know
[1:12:15] I'm know I'm going no know I'm doing
[1:12:17] God's Will and knowing that if I went
[1:12:19] and there's no church then that that
[1:12:21] should cause me to be concerned and I
[1:12:23] don't just want to go and be a part of
[1:12:24] just anything thing I want to have a
[1:12:26] place I can have a call it a
[1:12:28] home we talked for maybe 20 minutes and
[1:12:30] then I told him at the very end I said I
[1:12:31] don't know where this is going brother
[1:12:32] Scott said I believe God may be calling
[1:12:34] me he just gave we just talked as
[1:12:36] friends and shared some things and I
[1:12:37] said you know just follow the lord be
[1:12:39] prayerful God will provide and that the
[1:12:41] very I said I don't know where this is
[1:12:42] going but God may be called me to start
[1:12:43] a church in Phoenix he's like well all
[1:12:45] right then kind of like why didn't you
[1:12:46] just say that at the beginning I could
[1:12:48] have had my dinner
[1:12:50] already but even then I
[1:12:52] knew that it was no guarantee that if we
[1:12:55] started a church Brother Scott would be
[1:12:56] a part of it just because I was going to
[1:12:57] be here because I knew at the end of the
[1:12:59] day what was most important is that you
[1:13:01] follow God's will for your
[1:13:05] life that we don't have some
[1:13:08] loyalty to a
[1:13:21] house if I can say this Force housing is
[1:13:23] bondage yes
[1:13:27] it's a
[1:13:28] prison where there's a lack of agreement
[1:13:30] and Harmony and continuity and support
[1:13:32] where brother B says you ought to go
[1:13:33] somewhere you can support it if you're
[1:13:36] somewhere where you can't support it and
[1:13:38] you're obligated to it that's that's
[1:13:40] like that's forced labor that's bondage
[1:13:42] that's a
[1:13:43] prison your spirits aren't free in that
[1:13:46] situation but it says you've got to make
[1:13:48] a choice there's many plenty of forms of
[1:13:50] religion to go to but you've got to make
[1:13:52] a choice whether you're going to submit
[1:13:54] yourself to a spiritual church or formal
[1:13:57] Church
[1:13:59] woo people who submit themselves to a
[1:14:01] formal Church find a house but people
[1:14:04] who find a place that they can be a part
[1:14:06] of and will submit to it find themselves
[1:14:08] a
[1:14:09] home the sermon choosing of a bride I'm
[1:14:12] just going to have to read these and
[1:14:13] then and call it quits he's talking
[1:14:16] about choosing a bride and being
[1:14:17] prayerful pray for Revelation he said
[1:14:19] the same applies to choosing a church
[1:14:21] now you must pray over the church that
[1:14:24] you're fellowshipping in
[1:14:25] I know it's getting I know it's getting
[1:14:27] late in the the morning we're almost
[1:14:28] into the noon hour and I know you're
[1:14:30] tired I know some of you are drifting
[1:14:32] off but this this to me carries with it
[1:14:34] some weight that really needs to be
[1:14:36] heard because it's is an important
[1:14:37] principle brother Brandon says we've got
[1:14:39] to be housed but you just don't want to
[1:14:41] have a house you want to have a home
[1:14:43] this is so important listen you may want
[1:14:45] to you may there may be a part of you
[1:14:47] that wishes you weren't here today but
[1:14:49] this is going to be very plain and
[1:14:50] direct from the prophet he says You must
[1:14:52] pray over the church that you're
[1:14:54] fellowshipping in remember churches
[1:14:56] carry a spirit I don't want to be
[1:14:58] critical I realize that I'm an old man
[1:15:01] and I got to leave here one of these
[1:15:02] days I got to answer at the day of
[1:15:04] judgment for what I say tonight or any
[1:15:06] other time and I therefore got to be
[1:15:09] dead Earnest and truly convicted but you
[1:15:11] go into church and you'll watch the
[1:15:13] behavior of that church and you just
[1:15:14] watch the pastor a while and you'll find
[1:15:17] usually that the church acts like the
[1:15:19] pastor sometimes I wonder if we don't
[1:15:21] just get one another's Spirit instead of
[1:15:23] the Holy Spirit that's what makes a
[1:15:26] house but it certainly doesn't make it a
[1:15:27] home you get a place where a pastor is
[1:15:29] real radical and carrying on you'll find
[1:15:31] out the congregation is the same way
[1:15:34] listen to this I'll bring you to a
[1:15:36] church where I see the pastor stand jerk
[1:15:38] their heads back and forth you watch the
[1:15:39] congregation they do the same
[1:15:42] thing you take a pastor just gulp down
[1:15:46] anything usually the church will do the
[1:15:49] same
[1:15:50] thing notice this
[1:15:53] Dynamic just believe any myth or lie Gul
[1:15:56] down anything swallow anything preach
[1:15:58] anything swallow the people get in the
[1:16:00] same Rhythm and it's house their house
[1:16:04] but it's not what God's ordained it's
[1:16:06] not the way that it ought to be he's
[1:16:07] saying you you ought to be very
[1:16:09] Discerning about where you call what you
[1:16:11] call your
[1:16:12] house because if you're in a house where
[1:16:14] it's just the spirit of a man that can
[1:16:17] be a house all right but it's not the
[1:16:18] home that God
[1:16:20] ordained he says so if I was choosing a
[1:16:22] church I'd choose a genuine fundamental
[1:16:24] Full Gospel Bible church I was choosing
[1:16:26] one to put my family
[1:16:29] in so he said it's not just he said
[1:16:31] there's plenty of churches to go
[1:16:33] to but you should pray to find the right
[1:16:35] one that you belong
[1:16:37] in so that you're not just legalist in
[1:16:40] the sense that you're you can say I'm
[1:16:41] not
[1:16:43] unhoused right yes I'm not unhoused but
[1:16:47] really you're spiritually homeless
[1:16:49] yes because the solution to homelessness
[1:16:52] in the beginning was not just giving
[1:16:53] someone a house but it was given a a
[1:16:56] vision Brothers if you could come to
[1:16:58] your instruments in the balm of Gilead
[1:17:00] brother Bram says just the prayer before
[1:17:02] prayer for the sick I'd like to make
[1:17:03] just one little
[1:17:05] statement and I wish this above all
[1:17:07] things that you here tonight that who
[1:17:10] believes in your heart that you love the
[1:17:12] Lord and Something's Happened to you
[1:17:14] promise me that you'll find a good
[1:17:17] gospel church
[1:17:19] somewhere a church that teaches the Full
[1:17:21] Gospel the power of God his resurrection
[1:17:25] he says join up with those people and
[1:17:28] make yourself a church
[1:17:31] home when fa with the decision to stay
[1:17:34] home and not go to church brother B says
[1:17:36] that's wrong that's wrong go to church
[1:17:39] amen he acknowledges the difficulty in
[1:17:42] doing that he realizes there'll be
[1:17:44] certain challenges and ones that maybe
[1:17:46] we can't just thresh out in a single
[1:17:48] service like this but he's saying be a
[1:17:50] legalist about going to church you've
[1:17:52] got to do that you've got to be in
[1:17:53] church
[1:17:55] but have a
[1:17:56] vision have a vision that there's more
[1:17:59] and if there's more I want to be where
[1:18:01] there is more and I don't ever want to
[1:18:03] settle
[1:18:04] down I don't want to lose this
[1:18:07] proactivity in my life to I realize yes
[1:18:09] I've got to do this I've got to be
[1:18:11] housed but really God promised me a home
[1:18:12] not just a
[1:18:14] house so that we could say well I go to
[1:18:16] a church I go to a church and really
[1:18:18] we're not we're housed we may not be
[1:18:20] unhoused but really we're
[1:18:22] homeless and say Lord I don't want to
[1:18:24] just be
[1:18:25] housed I want to be
[1:18:28] homed I don't want to just
[1:18:32] be in
[1:18:35] bondage to a house and to be loyal to a
[1:18:38] structure I'll say it because brother
[1:18:40] Harold Becket said it God doesn't want
[1:18:42] you to be James Bond he wants you to be
[1:18:44] James
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:46] free and many of us have bound ourselves
[1:18:49] to things and we're housed but at what
[1:18:53] cost at what
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] price he says join up with those people
[1:19:00] make yourself a church
[1:19:03] home I want to have a
[1:19:05] home don't just stray around loose on
[1:19:08] the streets go get a good church
[1:19:11] somewhere of your
[1:19:13] choice how do you make that choice
[1:19:15] through prayer Lord lead me Lord guide
[1:19:17] me Lord where there's no vision I'm
[1:19:19] going to perish where there's no vision
[1:19:21] my family's going to perish I don't just
[1:19:22] want to be in a position where well
[1:19:24] we've got to go to church so we're
[1:19:25] housed no if you don't have a vision for
[1:19:28] where you're housed you suffer the
[1:19:30] damages of the spirit on that
[1:19:34] house you could just be gulping down
[1:19:37] anything you could just be radical and
[1:19:39] carrying
[1:19:41] on you've got to be so Discerning and
[1:19:43] prayerful Lord I want to have a place I
[1:19:45] know that I can go he says don't just
[1:19:48] stray around loose on the streets don't
[1:19:50] be
[1:19:52] homeless and I said don't just be
[1:19:55] housed get a good church somewhere of
[1:19:57] your choice where the gospel and the
[1:19:59] power of God is made known and the signs
[1:20:00] of eternal life is in there the signs
[1:20:02] that we in
[1:20:04] Christ can I be very
[1:20:07] direct he says in this place and may
[1:20:09] they find a good church home here in
[1:20:12] Phoenix
[1:20:14] somewhere or wherever they're
[1:20:17] from why because they may be here but
[1:20:20] it's not where they
[1:20:21] belong so it's not about creating a
[1:20:24] Mecca it's not about having a place
[1:20:25] where everyone can go and be housed
[1:20:27] listen this is not communism where we've
[1:20:30] established government housing where
[1:20:32] everyone lives in one
[1:20:34] structure and we're all just trying to
[1:20:36] have everything in common through
[1:20:37] legalism we we value the leadership of
[1:20:40] the holy spirit in individual's lives we
[1:20:43] want to promote that we want to
[1:20:44] cultivate that provide resources to
[1:20:46] where a man can stand in his home and
[1:20:48] even if it's in in a situation where
[1:20:50] he's finding himself H uh being bucked
[1:20:53] up a little bit and and has to just take
[1:20:54] make a stand and say honey I've got to
[1:20:56] be obedient to God's perfect will I've
[1:20:59] got to honor him in all that we do and
[1:21:01] this is God's will for our
[1:21:04] lives it may be difficult it may be hard
[1:21:07] we may feel that we're unhoused but as
[1:21:10] long as we're in God's perfect will we
[1:21:12] at
[1:21:14] home find a good church home here in
[1:21:18] Phoenix I I'm I'm I'm happy to say I I
[1:21:22] just feel such a liberty in my spirit to
[1:21:24] know that what's the ultimate is is is
[1:21:27] in the is in your own individual life
[1:21:29] this isn't a group move yes this is not
[1:21:32] a group move God is not dealing with us
[1:21:34] because we have a a
[1:21:36] quorum God is not honoring us because we
[1:21:40] gathered together as a group listen if
[1:21:43] there was only one elect person in here
[1:21:45] this morning God's presence is here to
[1:21:48] vindicate them to nourish them to
[1:21:51] encourage them to provide them a vision
[1:21:53] to feed them get them further down the
[1:21:55] road and he just used this whole dynamic
[1:21:58] to watch out after them and strengthen
[1:22:00] them who are perfect toward
[1:22:02] him to give them a vision so they don't
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:08] perish and if I could say
[1:22:10] this if these principles are
[1:22:14] true look well the the idea the unhoused
[1:22:18] and the
[1:22:19] homeless some are unhoused and
[1:22:23] homeless some are are housed and
[1:22:26] homeless some may have a home and they
[1:22:29] need to find a
[1:22:30] house there's different ways of looking
[1:22:32] at this I
[1:22:34] realize but if we as we looked at this
[1:22:36] particular
[1:22:39] Dynamic of there being a church which we
[1:22:42] call a
[1:22:44] house and us who come and go to that
[1:22:47] church where we become a part of it or
[1:22:50] that's where we have a house and that
[1:22:52] there's this idea that we could be going
[1:22:54] going to church but not be at home is
[1:22:56] this summarizing enough for you and that
[1:23:00] what God want that that we have to do
[1:23:01] that we need to go to church but God has
[1:23:04] not structured it to where we merely
[1:23:06] want to be legalist to say that we have
[1:23:08] a house but God has promised us he would
[1:23:11] feed us he would lead you to your own
[1:23:14] fold he would give you a family
[1:23:17] something you could support and be a
[1:23:18] part of and so there's this prayer that
[1:23:22] we need to undertake in our lives to
[1:23:24] where we know that at the moment and at
[1:23:27] this time we're in God's perfect will
[1:23:29] even if that may not have been the case
[1:23:31] before and even if it may not be the
[1:23:33] case later for now I'm walking in the
[1:23:36] vision because the solution to
[1:23:39] homelessness is not just to have a house
[1:23:43] but it's the development of real
[1:23:45] character it's to have a vision it's to
[1:23:48] hear from God it's to know I'm in his
[1:23:49] will it's to feed on the word of God and
[1:23:51] be benefited by it it's to grow it's to
[1:23:52] be exhorted it's to be cultivated do you
[1:23:54] understand what I'm trying to say and so
[1:23:57] we're prayerful about where we choose to
[1:24:00] house ourselves because we know that we
[1:24:02] want that house to be a home and now if
[1:24:06] that's true about going to church how
[1:24:09] much more true should it be about the
[1:24:10] rest of your
[1:24:13] life if it's true about the Sunday
[1:24:16] mornings and the Wednesday nights how
[1:24:18] much truer is it about the place you
[1:24:21] return to this afternoon and the place
[1:24:23] you leave from from Wednesday
[1:24:26] afternoon how much TR more true is it in
[1:24:30] all these other areas in our lives where
[1:24:31] we're strictly hung up on the legalism
[1:24:34] of
[1:24:35] housed but we're still
[1:24:40] homeless let us not be spiritually
[1:24:43] unhoused we should not be emotionally
[1:24:48] unhoused nor should we be spiritually
[1:24:50] and emotionally
[1:24:52] homeless my desire desire for for for my
[1:24:56] life is to be at
[1:25:00] home I think it's even
[1:25:03] in Philippians maybe where he's talking
[1:25:06] about this I'm I'm
[1:25:08] caught I I'm I'm between two
[1:25:11] desires to be here with you and to be at
[1:25:15] home with the
[1:25:17] Lord I say it's okay to feel that
[1:25:20] way as long as you don't become homeless
[1:25:23] here
[1:25:25] and lose your vision here we've got to
[1:25:28] have that's my thing we've got to have
[1:25:32] Vision amen I'm finished
[1:25:35] today you can let go of your seats in
[1:25:39] other words you can stand
