TRANSCRIPT
========================================
john chapter 5 verses 30 to 40. i have uh i think i accidentally noted just to verse 39 on the slides and then even later i might actually just have it noted to verse 39 but it is going to be um john chapter 5 verses 30 to verse 40. and i make i'll make some comments now um before we've been reading my title is i am an open book and as you pondered that phrase as you pondered that title there is a clear indication speaking about the i am and then also i want you to think about who you are john chapter 5 verse 30 i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not my own will but the will of the father which hath sent me if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that beareth with witness of me and i know that that that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true he sent unto john and he bear witness under the truth but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved he was a burning and shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but i have a greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which has sent me hath born witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time they're seen as shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom you he hath set him you believe not search the scriptures from them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life god bless you you can be seated consider this title i am in laying some foundational things i am an open book if you turn with me to exodus chapter 3 this is where i'd like to start this morning exodus chapter 3 verse 14. this is god speaking unto moses and it says and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am have sent me unto you i know that we're all familiar with this phrase and i know that in touching on these things in the outset it's things that we're already very conscious of very aware of so it's not breaking new territory but i do want you to ponder this phrase i am that i am and then he says to let the children of israel know i am hath sent me unto you in our english language that might seem to be a very peculiar phrase this has very very deep meaning and significance to a hebrew and to say i am that i am i just want to take some time to kind of amplify that phrase i am who i am i will be who i want to be he's saying i am that i am this is the person of god this is the self-existing one the i am that i am is the being of beings and when god says this and he uses this language to describe himself i am that i am and tell the children of israel that i am i am hath sent me unto you it's god declaring himself as eternal is god declaring himself as immutable god declaring himself to has existed at all times and will to never cease to exist to say i am that i am i am who i am it's to say i am past present and future i am what i am presently but i am what i have been and i am what i shall be and i shall be what i am that's what he's declaring i am what i am presently i have been what i have been i will but will i shall be and i shall be what i am i'm unchanging i will be brother abraham says from i am he was the i am and i am is everlasting it's eternal not i was i will be but i am present tense all ages the same yesterday today and forever i am and for him to say i am what i shall be and i shall be what i am this is what's represented in this phrase i am that i am the the word m in the hebrew is hayah which means to be or to become it means to come to pass or to exist or to happen so we say i am it's in the same sense it's a condition i am it's to be i exist i've come to pass to become known and it's from this phrase that they get jehovah the word i think we've touched on this in the past it comes from this word which means he is the eternal self-existing one who will become what he is he's the becoming god i am so this is what i am i'm something i'm essential to my character there's something about me there's attributes but it's i am not i was not even what i will be but i am because i will be what i am that will never change and and this is connected with jehovah because in the next verse exodus chapter 3 verse 15 it says and god said moreover unto moses thou shalt thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my moral unto all generations the lord jehovah god elohim jehovah elohim this is the i am this is what god is expressing to moses i am that i am this is the lord god jehovah elohim and so we know who the i am is it's god himself it is the one that existed before time in john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and we know that that word is god that god is his word this is who the i am is now that's uh that i think it kind of helps preface we're breaking down maybe just the title i realize now uh this is probably a way just to kind of uh put this that is the i am in the i am an open book now let's ponder this this idea of an open book in first corinthians chapter 13 verse 12 paul says for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known now there's a now we see through a glass darkly now i know in part and then those are companion phrases but then face to face then shall i know even as also i am known this is i've been pondering this scripture and have many things to share from it but i want to just take a very uh narrow thought right now is how he says for now we see through a glass darkly to see through a glass the word that is represented there the image that is represented would be a mirror now we see in a mirror but ancient mirrors were made of polished metals and so you wouldn't get an exact perfect reflection now i'm seeing through a gla through a mirror and this mirror is a partial reflection because he says now i know in part i'm seeing impart i'm not seeing the full complete picture and he's and he uses this phrase to describe what he's looking at in the glass so he's not questioning the reality of what he's looking at he's not questioning the truth of what he's looking at or the existence of it but he's just recognizing that in this glass he says it's darkly and it literally means in enigma we're looking and that's the word that is used and exactly what it means an enigma is a person or thing that is mysterious an enigma is something that is a puzzling or difficult to understand you ever heard of what an enigma is and so an enigma is a statement which conceals a hidden meaning or a statement or something that conceals something that's known uh that conceals something that's a known thing uh that is hidden under obscure words or or some other form that's what it means for something to be enigma paul said right now i see through a glass darkly what i'm looking at i know it's there but i'm i don't fully understand it there's things that are hidden there's things that are concealed and it's obscured under certain forms so to say that i see through a glass darkly i see even an enigma it's an obscure thing it's a riddle even in the the greek it says an enigma a riddle this is a riddle to me uh where i'm still trying to understand the full meaning and rep what it represents so to contrast that now i'm seeing an image and it's a riddle to me it's obscure it's not perfectly clear it says but then face to face then shall i know even also i am known face to face means with clarity then if on one hand it's darkly to say that he sees face to face is to recognize distinctly and and we can immediately begin to just think in the natural when you see something face to face you come face to face with something it's in its reality form you you can it's not just an image or a reflection and paul is certainly he's wanting us to consider that that now i'm seeing in a mirror darkly it's an enigma it's a puzzle but then it's going to be clear and when he says face to face and i shall know even also as i am known it's in the sense of removing the mystery to be able to look at something and appreciate it and know it and see it for what it is and now not to trigger people who hated their uh english classes or literature classes in high school or college i wanted to quote from romeo and juliet brother shakespeare uh in in this it's uh uh juliet's mother that makes this statement but it to me it just uh and i had to kind of stop reading it because like wow you could start bringing out a lot of types here but i only i just wanted to express this one aspect of seeing something face to face and notice this is a common uh this would be a common thing and maybe it seems to be an odd reference to trying to make this point but i it's to get this concept of reading something looking into something and seeing something and so juliet's mother lady capulet says read or the volume which is a book read the book read the volume of young paris's face and find a light writ there with beauty's pen examine every married liniment and see how one another lends content and they talk about the lines of someone's face where lines are joined the the car the uh the visage the image the countenance of this one and it says and what obscured in this fair volume lies find written in the margin of his eyes it's described in a book look into the volume or the book of his face and and look at the lines how they laid and then what seems to be obscure or hidden or there's enigma in this book find it written in the margin it's alluding to something that would be explained it's there you you read something i don't know what that means but there's a footnote there's something written today it would be a footnote but even then they wrote explanatory phrases in the margin saying read the book look into the book of this one and you'll learn who he is and you'll recognize the beauty or the character and this is just being used in a very in literature and shakespeare just being the incredible writer that he was or maybe they believe it was a team of writers whatever the mythology is today basically she's saying to her daughter read him like a book and this is what paul is alluding to says right now we see in a glass darkly but then face to face you'll see it clearly you'll be able to see it as a the true person who they are and we even have this phrase to read someone like a book or if someone else is an open book you say we read someone like a like a book is to discern someone's thoughts you can read them like a book you know what they're thinking you know what they're feeling you know their character and as paul says then shall i know even also as also i am known in psalms 139 verses 1 and 2 it says oh lord thou hast searched me and known me thou knowest my down sinning and my uprising thou understandeth my thought afar off there's a few translations that literally render this to i am an open book to you you know me you can read me you can read my mind you know my thoughts you know what i'm going to do you know my beginning you know my end you can flip back and forth through me i am you've read me like a book you know everything about me i you know the sum and substance beginning middle and end you know my origin you know my back story you know my motive you know the plot you know everything about my life you have searched me and known me you've read me you know my downswing my uprising you know my thoughts from afar off you know me like an open book it says revelations chapter 20 verse 12 and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works paul refers to this time as the day when god shall judge the secrets of men these books are being opened and these books contain the works of man and they're judged according to their works and so it's in the opening of the book that a man is judged it's in the open of that book that you know the character the thoughts the motives and the objectives of that person paul is expressing this now we see in a glass darkly it's an enigma it's a puzzle but then face to face and then i shall be opened up and i shall know even also as i am known there's going to be things disclosed and things revealed even pogba says i'm going to be read like a volume and so an open book pondered this phrase with me together an open book is a person or thing that is easily understood or thoroughly understood or easily interpreted it to say that a something is an open book it's you can understand it and and you can read it and you can recognize it a person or thing that is easily or thoroughly understood or easily interpreted that some it's not cryptic it's not an enigma it's not a puzzle to say that a person's life or a character is an open book it means you can find out everything about them because nothing's kept secret you say that that person's an open book they tell you what they're thinking they're telling what you're what they're feeling they're not mysterious to you to be an open book it's something that is easy to understand or to figure out if someone is an open book it's one who acts honestly and not secretive and not hypocritical that they there's some integrity the way that they're acting they say oh well so-and-so told me that they wanted me to be successful and they'd say well that person that they were being honest they just weren't making that up something or someone that can be readily examined or understood that's what's meant behind an open book this idea this concept of an open book it can be examined it can be understood david said search me you've searched me and known me you've poured through my pages you know my volume it's someone or something that can be examined searched and understood that's an open book kind of understand what i'm looking at in terms of an open book now okay maybe we should start with the what the literal thing would be this is a closed book this would be an open book right that's the first part now we're looking at more of a figurative sense and what it looks at and what it represents and those are important because these phrases are used in a very figurative way and sometimes we get in our minds that these things are very literal so we're we're imagining right now that there is a literal uh chair in heaven that says mercy on it right because we think we take things very literally and it's not always intended to be literal so there's on the one hand the open book now on the other hand even what paul is describing for now we see through a glass darkly now i know in part it's not all available it's not all opened up it's not complete and so that would be described in a closed book someone who is a closed book or something that is a closed book it's someone or something that's difficult to know or difficult to understand if something is a closed book it is a secret is a mystery it is a puzzle paul said that this now it is an enigma to me it is a puzzle it is secretive it is not fully fully available to me so it's an illusion the information that one can't obtain and say well i can't get that information that's a closed book to me i don't have access to that if something is a closed book is something you can't comprehend or something you can't obtain you don't have access to it just a couple scriptural examples in isaiah chapter 29 verses 11 and 12 it says in the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed the vision of all things the understanding of all things the knowledge of all things he's saying it's a book that's closed it's a book that is sealed which men delivered to one that has learned saying read this i prayed then he saith i cannot for it is sealed it's a closed book to me it is a puzzle it is mysterious i cannot understand it i cannot read it and then it says and the book is delivered to him that has not learned saying read this i pray they said i am not learned that means the vision of all this understanding this knowledge remains sealed up it remains mysterious it remains an enigma puzzle that people can guess at and wonder at its contents and so there's a uh uh this is what a closed book means in daniel chapter 12 verses eight and nine he says and i heard but i understood not so daniel here's but he does not understand he says it's a there's a understand comprehension is lacking and being able to fully grasp it is not there maybe i know in part and i see a little bit and i know it's truth or i heard something i see something but it's not fully understood then said i oh my lord what shall be the end of what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end god then is speaking to daniel's question i want to understand i don't understand these things tell me what these things are open up to me the understanding i i know there's something here that i i want to grasp i want to understand i want to be able to uh apprehend myself and then articulate and god says it's closed this book is closed this is something that's difficult to know and to understand because you're not going to be able to readily obtain its understanding i'll be able to grasp it because it's a secret it's a mystery it is a puzzle this is what i i want you to ponder an open book and a closed book so our title is i am an open book the subject that we're exploring and just beginning to look at i am an open book but i ask the question is it an open book or a closed book i am i thought about just putting the question mark i am an open book or is it a closed book which is he job chapter 37 verse 5 it says god thundereth marvelously with his voice that means difficult it's marvelous it's hard he thundered marvelously with his voice great things do with he which we cannot comprehend these things are mysterious to not be able to comprehend something it means that you can recognize its existence you can see that it is and you can you can understand that it has some being it has some purpose it has some attributes and characteristics but when you can't comprehend somebody uh let's just look at it this way there's times that we see somebody do something and we're not arguing about why they the fact that they did it we're having a hard time comprehending why hey like there's no doubt this was done it's very clear to me that you just did what you just did but what we can't comprehend is mode of objective purpose intent like what were you thinking why did you do that and there's this you're wrestling with it he said god does marvel he thunders marvelously difficult hard with his voice and the voice can be heard and he does great things but we cannot comprehend them we cannot fully know them he's saying it's mysterious to us in his even his motive and his intent and his purpose is hid to us it's not revealed and that's what a mystery is a mystery is something difficult to understand and so god is a puzzle to mankind god can speak i heard what he said but it can still be mysterious marvelous god can speak god can act god can even provide things and they can be very tangible but yet to fully comprehend them it would seem to be unsolvable in isaiah chapter 45 verse 15 verily thou art a god that hides thyself o god of israel the savior this is speaking to the an attribute of god a quality and a character of god thou art a god that hideth thyself it means to hide carefully to be concealed you are a god who is secretive you are a god that uh remains mysterious to man though we see your handiwork and though you may act in a way and even the god of israel the savior and even though he had spoken to them so often they say you are a god that hides yourself because you can't just clearly be explained you cannot fully be grasped and i want to point this out that it says verily thou art a god that hideth thyself that it is in his nature to hide himself it's a god who is hidden he hides himself even in simplicity but it's his intent to hide psalm 77 19 says it this way thy way is in the sea and thy path and the great waters there's whenever a boat passes through the sea you can't go back later and find its tracks the waters return and cover it up it covers the path that covers the way the way thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known as a a ship passing through the sea or as a boat through the waters thy way is in the sea thy path of the great thy footsteps are not known you can see the impact of the presence something could have been there but the tracks are undiscoverable it's a very very rich scripture just to ponder as job is saying it and in isaiah god you're a god that hides yourself and your footsteps are not known but yeah we know that you've been here we know you've passed this way but to go back and figure it all out and see your imprints and your your steps and default solve them and follow them they're they're too hard for us in romans chapter 11 verses 33 and 34 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable you want to know the definition of unsearchable you can't search it how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who have been his counselor this phrasing and realize that paul is drawing from job as he makes these statements in other places and we see a similar thoughts expressed even in the psalms his unsearchable judgments his ways that cannot be found out his his judgments cannot be searched out you know google may be very very good at this but it cannot search it and it's unsearchable judgments his ways past finding out a diligent examination cannot uncover them you can say oh well i haven't tried hard enough let give me more time i can figure this out i i'm very good at research let's put a team on this i just need the right search string i just need a more robust search engine he's saying his judgments are unsearchable his ways are past finding out even diligent examination isn't going to achieve the result of finding them out why is the scripture says in isaiah chapter 55 verses 8 to 9 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord and this is this is not merely to point out a difference because as human beings uh we know mankind and we understand and appreciate one another because we're possessed with the same human spirit and we have though there may be a vast difference in how we have experienced things and even the things we've experienced and how we appreciate and interpret our experiences can be very different on some level what's beautiful about being a human is we at least ought to be able to uh sympathize with somebody else saying i can relate to pain that may not hurt me but i can relate to pain and i don't like that food but i know what it's like to like food that people don't like and i may not ever want to go there but there's places i want to go that people don't like and we begin to appreciate that we have differences but that's not what god is saying he's not saying you like thai food i like mexican food and you like to hunt and i like to fish no he's saying my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts they are completely and totally different on different planes not just differences of opinions but if even i can say it this way god doesn't have opinions right we have opinions we have assessments we have takes on things and and we have feelings and and and we can change god just is immutable and everything's fact everything's truth and so he says it this way for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts he's wanting to create the greatest difference and distinction between thoughts and ways from ours and here so that we can realize it's not like if we just try hard enough we'll get it why because god is mysterious to us he's a god that thundereth marvelously and he speaks but yet it's still difficult to understand god speaks and one man hears a voice and another man hears a thunder imagine that god speaks and one person says that's that's nothing but the truth and somebody else says that's a lie this is the puzzle this is the enigma this is how god is he's a god that hides himself he's a god that passes through in his footsteps are not known his judgment's unsearchable his ways past finding out who can know the mind of the lord who can sympathize let alone empathize who can even begin to grasp and comprehend because these things are so beyond ourselves is god an open book or a closed book in matthew chapter 11 verse 27 he says all things are delivered unto me of my father jesus speaking so now all things are delivered to him the father has given him placed in his care given him this understanding and possession of all things and no man knoweth the son but the father now this trying to put ourselves in the shoes of those who'd walked with him and had following him as master and then they're told that no man knows the son but the father he's using a language that would cause them to ponder and consider well we thought we were getting to know you we thought we knew you he's referencing something that maybe begins to take it out of this realm of well we know jesus who his mother was we know his brother we know his sister we know his father his mother we know these things about we've been with him through this time but now he's saying no man knows the son but the father so it's saying nobody knows me but god and and we could say well that certainly we could appreciate that who knew the son who understood him as he's trying to plainly declare hey guys i'm going to need to die and they're like no you're not we're going to fight for you we'll die for you he wasn't understood he wasn't appreciated he wasn't felt and uh uh and and known except by the father and then reverses it neither knoweth any man the father saved the son now this means there's only one person that knows the son and only one person that knows the father and that's it this is a very exclusive club all right there's the father and the son it's the father and son club and if you ain't the father and you ain't the son you ain't getting in because only one person knows me and that's my dad and only one person knows my dad and that's me and everybody else is like who you talking about who's the father who's the son we know who you're talking about some people sometimes say uh brother aaron whatever you do please don't share them you'll say what and then they start saying it yeah i don't know what you're talking about and then they just want to keep explaining it to you it's like in other words i'm not going to tell anybody it's like oh i thought maybe you really didn't know but this case no man knows the son no man knows the father except one another and then he says and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him this is an exclusive club and the only way you can get in is by revelation and and you have to come by way of the son so you cannot know god just by finding him in his creation you cannot know god truly no god to appreciate god just by recognizing that there has to be one who is above it all controlling the affairs of man it has to be through a revelation of jesus christ you cannot know god outside of christ revealing the person of god to you and so this is maybe maybe we've arrived at a point to where you start to understand yeah he can be a closed book and he can be an open book because this god who is marvelous and he's wondrous and he cannot be comprehended and he hides himself and his footsteps are not known and his judgment's unsearchable his ways past finding out because they're higher and thoughts are higher his ways are higher and at some and it's only known by the sun and only the son is known by the father but by revelation he can become known to you this is the i am john chapter 8 verses 52 to 59 i appreciate just your attentiveness this morning and your your diligence just to listen and to ponder these things and think about these things and john chapter 8 verses 52 to 59 then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast the devil abraham is dead in the prophets and thou sayeth if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death and so when he said and you can even go back to a lot of things he's saying in john chapter 6 just to kind of see how this is building this is building and he's really just getting getting them really hot under their sports collar and he's saying if you said that if a man will keep your sayings and he said in john if you eat this you'll never die if a man will keep your saying he's never going to taste to death and abraham and all the prophets are dead now we know you have a devil art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead who maketh thou thyself who maketh thou thyself and jesus answered if i honor myself my honor is nothing it is my father that honoreth me of whom you say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but i know him it's almost like nah but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying these are these are hard things your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad this is if we could again just think about this jesus says hey if you keep my sayings you're never going to die like all right we know you've got a devil now you know i got a devil because abraham's dead the prophets are dead and you say if anybody will keep your words they're going to never die are you greater than abraham are you greater than all the prophets who do you think you are he says hey if i honor myself it's nothing but my father honors me and my father is god even the one you claim is your god but you don't really know but i do and if i said i didn't know them and then i'd be a liar like you right why are they liars because they say they know him but they don't and he's saying but i know him and i keep his saying your father abraham this to me is really the meat your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it now this i know we touched on i believe in the the subject of the supreme faith of abraham supreme faith revealed in abraham and how what what this would mean and what it would represent but he was he was long too and he rejoiced to see and was excited to see my day and he saw it and was glad there's something this is just really in their face and this is their response then said the jews unto him thou art not yet 50 years old and hast thou s seen abraham i would say based upon what jesus did to them this is a very weak reply but they just they're they're uh they're uh they're non-plus they're shocked they don't know what to say and you are you're a man who's not yet 50 not even 50 years old and you say you've seen abraham jesus said unto them catch this verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am now you catch how remarkable that statement is hey before abraham was i am and this is it's very clear the jews caught what he intended because now notice what they say what they do then they took up stones to cast him but jesus hid himself and went out to the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by he still he still blended in he hid himself from them and passed it passed through before abraham was i am it's a phrase that to us in english ought to catch us that when you're referring to something in the past tense you would not want you you could not use a language to say if you want to say where you were yesterday you would use past tense and says before friday it was thursday you wouldn't say before friday it is thursday you're you're looking backwards you're looking in a sense that things change and things evolve and conditions and states but he says before abraham was i am before abraham was brought into being i am i there i had an existence before abraham had existence and like i said the jews know exactly what he meant he was already kind of needling a little bit i mean hey if i said i didn't know god i'd be a liar just like you and you claim to know god but you don't but i know i mean it's it's already getting to the boiling point but if there was something that was going to tip them over it was this phrase to say i am before abraham was i am because this is the very one that declared himself when he began to fully vindicate and affirm the promise that was given to abraham even as he said that unto your father abraham was i not known as this in other words i have made promises that he had not yet seen fulfilled but now the i am is here fulfilling to the children of israel the promise that i made to abraham and for him to say before abraham was i am it upset everything they believed why because there was only one before abraham and that is the i am because their religion their faith everything began with abraham they don't go before that they don't deal with nimrod they don't deal with cain they're not they're not relating themselves they find their faith embodied in abraham for him to use the language not before abraham was i was or before abraham he uses it so purposely i am it's then that they took up stones to stone them in john 5 18 he says therefore the jews sought the mort to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath this happened prior but all said also that god was his father making himself equal with god so what prompted them what was burning in their hearts to make them want to stone him in john chapter 8 because he said i am he identified himself with the i am he identifies himself with the father not so much to a father-son relationship but now the embodiment the expression of he identifies himself with the i am and then there's this is exactly what angered them in john chapter 5 he said that god was his father and it makes himself equal with god so for jesus say before abraham was i am jesus is connecting his life with that of god himself and i it's very important that we that we pray for revelation and that we seek to have an understanding of the godhead and the person of god and the expression the manifestation of jesus christ because we don't we know that we're not trinitarians right and you know the number one mark of a cult is they deny the trinity i i think it's number one in larsen's book of cults is if you don't if you deny the truth of the trinity they just put you in that bucket so uh you you know you know who's writing the book now right now we know that you're a devil because you believe in the trinity now there's a uh that there's a we need to have a greater appreciation than just to deny the trinity and then wholesale swallow a upc idea of oneness we can't do that either it's a revelation of the godhead it's a revelation of god himself and so there's a when he says before abraham was i am he's making this connection and if i can say it this way jesus christ was the manifestation of the i am the one that met moses and was making himself known oh if i could just see you and he allowed that uh his backside to pass over he hit him in the cleft of the rock and passed by him jesus christ is making himself akin to that and identifying himself with that he says i i am that's making christ a part of this puzzle this one who his way he thunders marvelously whose ways are are unsearchable and unable to find out and thoughts are higher ways are high this one god that we cannot comprehend now this god is expressed in this person that's standing before him he is that sealed secret he is this hidden mystery this god we cannot comprehend the bible puts it this way in john chapter 1 verse 18 no man have seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him the only begotten son this one who is at the heart of god he declares the father no man has seen god at any time but the father is declared by the son it it's meant to express that no man had seen god at any time but the son has unfolded this one to us that we may see him john chapter 14 verses 5 to 9 if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him that i i in pondering it now that we could slow down just on this statement alone but i see time is moving rather quickly if you know me if you had known me you know the father and then he says and from now on you know him and have seen him now philip and if you want to go back and read the a larger portion of this prior to this and then afterwards very key statements relating to the end time in john chapter 14 it's philip catches this lord show us the father and it sufficeth us just show us the father will be satisfied it is enough that we would see the father and in that and we've expressed this to you before we might read them like oh silly philip but in this philip is catching the tr the purpose of christ he's realizing this is what you're for that he's starting to burn within him and he's starting to get it yes god god sent his son that we might know him he he's sending his son to so that we could see him and feel him and touch him and handle him and this is this is the introduction this is the messenger this is gonna be the only way we're ever gonna see jehovah elohim so he says just show us to him show him to show him to us and it'll satisfy everything and then but jesus kind of catches maybe this element that's missing because philip is getting very very close to the truth but maybe just the parts missing have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip didn't he asked to see the father but jesus said you don't know me he that hath seen the father or excuse me he that have seen me hath seen the father this is the this is the force with which he wanted to get philip's attention this longing this passion this desire this hunger i will be satisfied my heart will be full i i will no longer weep and grieve i will no longer feel bankrupt i would no longer feel hopeless this agonizing pain that we have as jews to see jehovah elohim to see his person this one we couldn't even touch the mountain he was on no man could see him and live and you're bringing me so near him jesus just let me see him jesus wanted to meet him with this forest and say philip when you've seen me you have seen him oh what a what a revelation that could have been in that very moment he says then how can you say show us the father when you're looking at jesus christ you are seeing the father and brother branham and the message god's chosen place of worship he says when he met moses he had not a name yet and he told moses i am that i am. and when we see jesus on earth speaking saint john the eighth chapter he said i am that i am. he said oh no i thought he said i am well they said why you're a man not over 50 years old and say you seen abraham he said before abraham was i am this is what and just a very in two very very small words three letters i am could you what is what what could we say in three letters that would want people to kill us right i am was enough for them to take up stones why because there's such a revelation represented in this i am that i am he says and i am was the one the burning bush the pillar fire that was in the burning bush back in the days of moses the i am the i am i am who i am i am the being of beings i am the self-existing one i am this this i am the lord god i am the jehovah elohim in question and answers part three and at the end of august in 64 brother rams asked the question has the name of the lord changed in the different dispensations he says yes yes he was called the i am as he said in exodus 3 15 this is he says i am that i am and he says this is my name forever the lord god he says he begins with he was called the i am he was called jehovah he's changed many times the last time it was changed was when god became flesh and took a human name jehovah i am and all those are titles to a name if you were baptized in the name of jehovah it have to be the name of jesus christ if you were baptized in the name of jehovah rapha jehovah manasseh jehovah jiren all those it have to be jesus christ the i am is jesus christ jesus said he came in his father's name he said the i am is jesus christ remember standing there that day and he said you say you eat man in the wilderness our fathers eat manna and are dead and he said and he's taken even from john 6 john 8 and they said well we know that you're crazy because you're just a man not over 50 years old and you say you've seen abraham he said before abraham was i am he was the i am and all the titles and names that ever belonged to god was made one human name the lord jesus christ that's a that's a remarkable climax would you not say that this mysterious god who dwelt in a realm all by himself unknowable unapproachable he was all that there was and no man knows him sees them but then now one day one comes and says he's the son of god and and says that when you see me you see this mysterious one could we just put aside maybe our christianity just from now don't go crazy with that pus just push aside the idea that we've accepted this just it's in our hearts we believe that we're made to believe it and just kind of try to get that you know what that would even mean that we're just kind of going along right we're just kind of living our lives and all somebody somebody shows up and it's like i'm the son of god i'm it this is me i'm the son of god i have come from god before abraham was i am this is strange right this would be very very strange i know we have the benefit of doubt being a couple thousand years later and not having to really wrestle with the idea of who's this guy right but think of the process think of the principle and i'm i've been reading i've been reading a book and trying to think of a way just to succinctly put it but i'm reading of the dozens and dozens of false messiahs that have existed throughout time and their histories and their stories and there's even ones that the jews say you know what this guy was more like the messiah than jesus was and so depending on which book you're reading jesus is just in the list of crazies right and they have and there's and when you start thinking about that way and and i want to i'll say this as i'm thinking about it because it's it said when you think about it that way it sounds just to us to some people it's exactly what it sounded like when brother brown said and the seals were open to us the other day in jeffersonville like who's this guy right what are you talking about this is this can't be this is what's happening to the the jews in that day when he says i am in john chapter 5 this is what we took our text in i'm just going to start with verse 37 i would like to read to verse 40 even though i think i indicated only verse 39 on the slide making mistakes in john chapter 5 verses 37 to 40 and the father himself which hath sent me hath born witness of me just think of all these different places where jesus is jesus and the father just kind of have this they're woven together no man had seen god or the father at any time but the only begotten son he who was in the bosom of the father he's declared him show us the father when you've seen me you've seen the father you claim to believe in my father whom you say is your god but you don't know him but i do and if i said i didn't know god who is my father then i'd be a liar like you who claim him to be your god and abraham to be your father there's this this emphasis no man knows the son but the father no man knows the father but the son and if you want to know the father you've got to come by me and so he says this and the father himself which hath sent me had borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time neither seen his shape now in john chapter 5 he's looking at it and i'll say this and maybe catch this as a principle you could read this and say what jesus said they had never seen the father and never seen his shape so jesus you've never heard his voice or see the same so then jesus couldn't have been his voice and he couldn't have been in shape right couldn't we do that just try to nail pin jesus down on his words but you have to catch what he's what he's expressing to them the father himself which hath sent me hath born witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he have sent him you believe not now this would apply not just to jesus but to john this would apply to to many others that he's been sent now this is kind of the thrust of what i've been studying and i just want to introduce it i'll come back to it in the future search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and there they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life there's the symmetry that he has just made here is christ standing there speaking but you're not hearing his voice or seeing his shape you haven't seen it any time and because you have not received me you have him not abiding in you so he says search the scriptures search the scrolls search the written word search the old testament search your torah search your search what is your scrolls the the words of the prophets that which has been transcribed and say search the scriptures it's a reference to these things which have been written down he says search them because in these you think you have eternal life it's in this that you have this representation of life but this these writ this written word is what testifies of me he says but you will not come to me that you might have life and he's saying that here's the written book here's the book that was delivered to you here are the scriptures made available to you he says and you think there's life in them but whatever life is in this you have to come to me to get the life that the book speaks of jesus christ was the living word making god present amongst them he was the written word he says search the scriptures diligently examine them go through them probe them you think you have eternal life in them it's the written word that testifies of me he was the written word made flesh he was the fulfillment of what moses prophesied jesus christ was then the tangible manifestation of the promise this god who was mysterious who weighs you could not figure out the one who dealt with the people in sundry times through prophets and signs and wonders and they could see the hand of god they could see the presence of god they could see the prophets who speak on behalf of god but now one is standing there saying i am i am an expression of a god who is invisible to you in the message man that can turn on the light if you could just steady yourself and be very deliberate in in listening to this and these remaining things that i'd like to share because i'm just going to kind of come to an abrupt stop and i not that i want you to stop with me i want you to have enough momentum that when i stop you can you could just take off you say i that you're you're you're you're kind of in the momentum of it and if i have to stop the the spirit doesn't stop working in your heart and the lord can continue to express these things to you so in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light so life is only by the word of god made manifest the only way that there's life but the word of god made manifest he says it search the scriptures and then you think you have eternal life those scriptures testify of me and you have to come to me to have life so brother ram says so life is only by the word of god made manifest if christ wasn't the word of god made manifest they could not come to him to have life then he says life comes only by the word of god made manifest i love the emphasis the repetition this is the part i want you just to let it kind of strike you a little bit as long as it's just in the book like this it can still it still can be questioned as long as it only exists in written form as long as it is only the product of the human writer as long as it is on the indian paper and the leather binding as long as it only exists in the book and he's actually re pointing to the bible and you might think oh my we know the reverence that brother branham had for that book and he wouldn't place other things on it and we know the confidence he instilled us to believe that this is the word of god and that this is jesus christ in written form and that this this bible declares the person of god but he's saying as long as it is just in the book like this he gives some validity to questioning it as long as it's just written on paper it can still be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested when it says one thing when the scriptures testify of a jesus christ and then the jesus christ comes when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it what it spoke of being manifested when you see the manifestation then that is light on the word you can have the word in written form you can have the word in paper form you can have the word in scripture form he says but when this translates the flesh he says that light on the word it's not just merely an understanding it's just not this mental acuity to grasp something and be able to parse things out and type things and and just run the concordance and read every scripture about something or just print quotes out and start reading things there's got to be a manifestation and when it's expressed with life and breadth behind it then that's light on the word said the word said so and then when it comes to past that is life in light light bringing life now i hope that you're able to kind of take this thought and there's a lot more that he uses in shalom in this sermon in particular about the light on the word bringing manifestation and the manifestation and vindication let's look at a scripture that expresses the same thing john chapter 1 verses 4 to 11 in him was life and the life was the light of men you do not come to me that you might have life and he uses a language to express that they're stumbling in darkness and they have not come to the life they have not come to the light but yet light has sprung up in him as the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not still a puzzle still mysterious it doesn't mean the light wasn't shining right let me consider this jesus is standing there saying when you've seen me you've seen the father but they didn't see the father does that mean they didn't see him does that mean he didn't exist does that mean jesus was lying the darkness comprehended it not the light was shining but darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god now the symmetry to even what jesus is saying about john that we read in our text it's it's just picking up this this expression he was a burning and shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light he said but i have a greater witness than that of john a greater witness is that not what he expressed to the disciples of john greater things shall you see and there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light scripture wants to be very diligent and purposeful to delineate between the one who perceives the one that foreruns and the one that speaks and testifies who himself is a great shining light but is not that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world and this is speaking of christ the one that we could come to later says that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us it says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not this is speaking of christ and i know it's a tremendous paradox these things he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not that's amazing so if i could think of it this way you have a book the scripture search the scriptures brother man says as long as it's in the book like this it can be questioned so in this form it can be questioned in this form it's probed at its guest at it's mysterious it's an enigma it's a puzzle but then when this is opened and it's made manifest it's not that all of a sudden everyone goes yes of course that's it because the light comes in the world and instead of the darkness dissipating the world rejoicing instead of his own receiving him he's rejected as long as it's in the written form it's still close it can it's still closed all right so let let me come back to just even this image as long as it stays like this it's an enigma when this happens it may still be an enigma but now it can be solved but if it never becomes this all we do is talk about it as long as it's a closed book we can just talk brother what are you thinking and honey what do you think about this and what do you think about that and we just talk about it we guess and we probe but once it becomes this it's only after it opens up it's only after the light comes on the word then he can be known but as long as it stays shut it's still a puzzle we're still just talking about it we're still just guessing about it but then once once it's once it's opened up this so then he says search the scriptures and i've got a i've got to close so i don't want to i'll just have to express this into greater detail later so then he says search the scriptures they had the written word but as long as it just remained written it remained closed but now he's saying search the scriptures because they testify of me that if there was a way that they could go back to what had once been closed and searched them then it would begin the process to recognize this is now open to us we can now see and thank god there were those that saw the book opened in that day let me bring it to this i want you to think very deeply about today then and it is very important and i feel a tremendous burden to be very zealous to def to to lift up and to preach jesus christ and and to preach the truth of the son of god to preach the deity of jesus christ to to reaffirm and acknowledge and lift up that there's christ in him crucified there is not another way of salvation there is not another blood there is not another birth that we've got to come by the way of the scripture and and he's been so obscured and so muddied and so mixed up with theology and christianity has has even against their their desire made a christ a mystery all over again but i also want you to think about today is the i am an open book or is he a closed book think deeply about today brother branham says now over in the book he's referring to the bible he says we find that the book was closed and shut up and sealed into the end of time this is the book tells us right we read it in daniel we can read it in revelation that the book is sealed the book tells us that the book is sealed now in this sermon god's power to transform i just want you to think about this but since the opening of those seven seals of them angels just behind the mountain yonder this has become a new book this has become a new book now what does it mean that the bible's become a new book what does it mean to say that we have an open book or we're the people of the open book what does it mean to express these principles and allude to these things i'm ending with this these of course i have one more statement to read you but this is what i want you to think about when you leave here today there may be two classes of people maybe three that would respond to these maybe those that would just outright reject it and then there's a class that might say well it's not opened and maybe there's a class that says it is opened different opinions and different takes on this but let's just take it for what he says since the open of those seven seals this has become a new book what does that mean and when i say what does it mean i am not asking i guess i'm not asking for it in just its meaning that well what it means when the book is open is that this happened and that happened and this transpired and this transpired no that's that that that's not what i mean when i say what does it mean what i mean is what's the implication when something happens and we can say well that happens well what does that mean you say well it means that it means this that this that and the other and the question no what i what i was intending by the inquiry is what do we do now what what impact does this have is i heard the testimony last week of the uh the brother and his wife and kiev that the bombs start falling they're woken at four o'clock in the morning with the bombs falling upon their city and they immediately begin to pack because they know what it means like honey what does that mean well that means that somebody manufactured a bomb with an explosive in it and it's kind of no no no no no no you missed my point what do we do now what what's the what are the consequences of this and and if i can say this with respect it is it is very important that we fully understand and appreciate what brother branham meant when he said the bible has become a new book it is very important for us to understand what he meant when he said the seals are open but then once we get that and we know what it is it is even more important that we get the consequences like we say oh that's what he meant then there has to be something that reverberates there has to be something that comes from there has to be a response to every action there's an equal and opposite reaction if this bible became a new book then what does that do to me what does that mean for me i know what it means that the bible became a new book i can accept that but what what's the consequence for me what what does that mean for my life and consider this as we close in souls that are in prison now when these seven seals were opened that opened up the entire bible i i again i i know i'm provided in slide form those that are streaming the service are unable to see it but you have access to the message these aren't my words that opened up the entire bible it's a new book now they may got a new translation nope he said the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in these seven seals held the entire mystery of it and this is the part you have to like i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm doing a handoff if this is a run pass option you're getting the ball all right i'm handing the ball to you and it was the book of redemption new testament not the old it only proclaimed for the new testament now think about that the standard with our heads bowed let us pray express your desires to the lord present with us he's with us now express your desires to him heavenly father as we are standing in your presence this morning we come before you deliberately lord with great purpose [Music] and we offer thanksgiving in our hearts for health for protection lord even when we have had financial difficulty you've met us in that need when we've had

the changes whether it be through a move or health whatever it might be and just how quickly we may seem to be overwhelmed we call out to the god who is invisible and we say oh god may your light

word in my life and may i experience healing or deliverance satisfaction of peace [Music] lord could you now come and pull back a veil [Music] so that we can see what we're fighting against am i fighting against your will am i fighting against my own will am i wrestling with my past am i unwilling to humble myself if i am i afraid to go forward to step forward lord whatever it is we need you right now and i pray that you bless your people for their attentiveness for their uh been very purposeful lord and they're listening and you know lord i pray as it was expressed at the beginning that lord may i not only just deliver this burden but may you now personalize it very deeply to each person's hearts lord i would that each of my children catch something in this i would that my wife have something very special that would even be if it's not obvious to me i know my family i know our needs i know what we're going through i know the trouble we're facing but lord may you do something so deep so personal that it's only you that knows these things so that we could say lord you read me like a book today granted i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
