TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just to mention that to you ephesians chapter 4 verses 22 to 24 it says that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness amen you may be seated we've been uh we're looking at uh who is that who is my neighbor we're asking ourselves that question not necessarily trying to determine who your neighbor is but rather who our own personal neighbor is and we've had several services on it to date and i want to just pick up in luke chapter 10 again if you could turn there and i want to read just a couple verses verses 33 and 34 and so we're we're jumping right into this subject and we'll capture a few things we mentioned last time uh in order to connect it uh further it says in luke chapter 10 verses 33 and 34 in answering the question of the the lawyer well who is my neighbor then why you know who who do i have to be good to who do i have to love uh as myself jesus uses this parable and comes to this one whom even the lawyer acknowledges well the one who showed mercy he was neighbor to him who fell among thieves and it says this but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him it's important to note and we'll expand upon this later it says a certain samaritan so it's not just some random samaritan it implies election or some quality to where he was a certain samaritan and he came to where this man was in verse 34 it says and he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him and these words are describing what is commonly referred to as the good samaritan and jesus is contrasting the lawyer's attitude and that attitude and actions of the priest and the levite with the conduct and attitude of the samaritan and this had to be an incredible rebuke to jews that he would use a samaritan as being the one who's fulfilling the law fulfilling the commandment in the law to be neighborly to this one who fell among thieves but jesus is wanting to take the samaritan's conduct and his ministering to this one who is in need and use it as a rebuke and instruction to this lawyer and last time we looked at different social dynamics that influence our behavior and and we were identifying uh things we called them maybe devices we use the scripture devices in our hearts there's many devices in our thinking and our psychology and our instincts and our attitudes but we're looking at these different social dynamics that influence our behavior and looking at even how in romans it speaks of a conforming power of the world that means there's a mold the world wants you to be in and there's a pressure that it can exert upon you to put you in that mold and we looked at the power of the crowd and how that we in our we have these instincts and these desires to conform uh we uh much rather mimic somebody else than be the oddball or mimic a group and do what the group is doing uh if we if you had fallen asleep right now and you woke up and you saw everyone standing you would stand up with everyone else regardless of what prompted them to do so you wouldn't want to be the one uh who is left understanding you would just mimic the group thinking well they must all be standing for good reason a good purpose and so you would just mimic instinctively and so we have these devices in our hearts we looked at them as biases and prejudice and different things from a social economic standpoint these ways that work within our psychology and these devices in our hearts sway our thinking if it can influence our thinking it can influence our acting and we mentioned the the group experiment and i want to show you that slide again of this group experiment where in they had a they had a room of six people and the of the six people and it was a study that was conducted and of the six people five were actors and one was a participant now there's the subject of the study and the question was very simple which line on the right is the same length as the line on the left and so that seems like a very simple question we would all say that c is the right is the right answer c is the same length as the line on the left and the uh what happened is the five actors all gave the wrong answer they may have said a and b they may have all joined in saying a and then they all or they all joined in saying b and by the time the participant had to give his answer in the presence of these five actors who were all given the wrong kind of information he would have to answer and they found that 75 percent of the time the non-actor the subject the one who was not in on the game he joined with the rest in giving the wrong answer in one study 97 conformed to the wrong answer and so it just showed the power of the crowd and how that we we experience pressure to conform that if everybody else is doing it then we want to do it and it's a it's a peer pressure that works within age groups it works within certain classes certain professions in certain ways that we identify with others and if they're doing it we feel the pressure to do it and it's remarkable to think that someone could absolutely know the right answer absolutely no that sees the correct answer but when five people give the wrong one you experience this pressure and and you say well it's a knowing better knowing that your eyes aren't full on you maybe some even begin to wrestle well i do have bad eyes maybe i'm on the wrong side of the slide whatever it might be but instead of sticking to your conviction that the answer seems very clear sees the right answer in a situation where there's no consequence they would just join in giving the wrong answer think about that there's no consequence in giving the right answer and so they would join like they would have said i think it's c and who cares if these other five guys uh think it's uh a i i know that it's c and it's not like they're going to take you out in the hallway and beat you up i mean it'd just be five people you don't know that you disagree with but it just goes to show in a situation like that how powerful the crowd can be and if it can be powerful in that kind of dynamic how much more powerful can it be when those five other people are in your family or your youth group or people you love or you're close to or people that you share camaraderie with or you associate with or professionally work with it creates this pressure upon the individual to join in something that they otherwise would not do and it's a pressure to conform and so we were looking at now i wanted to use that example because i want to come back to it in the end we're looking at how that our minds are the product of a fallen nature and then also the nurture of a world and a devil who is the god of this evil age who's the prince of the power of the air so our minds our thinking this circuitry all these ways that we process information is the product of a fallen nature and then also a worldly nurture and therefore we're subject to carnal influence if you want to know what qualifies you to be subject to carnal influence it's just have a breath just be breathing just be the product of a man and a woman a man born of a woman is subject to a woman born of a woman is subject to these carnal influences and we looked at first john chapter 2 verse 16 where it says for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life in these avenues of temptation these weaknesses we could say within human nature it exists within all human beings and it says all that is in the world all that is in our worldly nature all that a man could be tempted to is the lust of the flesh to the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and it stands contrary to the father's nature stands contrary to the word and if we were if we replace it in this way we're all born with the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life inside of us it would beg the question well then what would it take to overcome this and he said you must be born again there has to be some other source some other power some other influence on the inside and then we could we could put it in this context and how how can i overcome these instincts even as a born-again believer and you're going to find the word is the answer to all of it and so the answer we found in being transformed changed into another form by the word by the word itself renewing our minds it and bringing our minds subject to the word of god at changing our thinking changing our instincts you have an instinct a base instinct in the first nature by your first birth and it's the very first thing you do and we can even find that even in innocent things that when you're sick the very first thing you're going to do have a headache go get an advil if you have a pain or something that's creeping up on you you go to the doctor i need to get that looked at that's just first nature and and and that's just what we do humanly that's our experience that's we know to do brother branham says when you're sick your first duty is to go to your doctor but we know that there's another instinct to commit things to the lord to pray to ponder things to to to even lay hands on the sick and they shall recover there's other things that don't come with the first nature that don't come instinctively by our first birth and those are the things that we want to be energized to be fed to come to the surface kind of rise to the top in our lives until we begin to act upon his word with that with the spirit of god instead of our human nature we read it a couple places in the church age book where brother brown says but jesus overcame by the word and he says and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you're overcoming because that word cannot fail so you can only overcome by the word so the only way that you can be an overcomer is by the word and the only way that you can know if you're overcoming is by the word the word is our measuring stick as to whether or not we're overcoming not are you successful are you on top do people preserve uh perceive you as being a a powerful person and perceive you as being popular perceive you as being successful it's not a question of whether or not we ourselves are successful by worldly metrics but rather are we doing what the word says that we ought to do and if we are following in the pattern of the word and we're looking to the word and we're lining up with the word then we can say we are overcoming because i've looked to the word and the word says that i ought to be doing this and i'm doing it then we know we're overcoming and that's the only way that you can overcome is by the word and then brother branham says in his own personal life speaking of jesus contending with himself now if you could just think very uh uh just in an expansive way about this this phrase in his own personal life so this is him as a person and we realize that jesus was a person he was one that had a will he had a desire uh he was he was tempted in every point and manner that a man would be tempted so he had to have this individuality he had this part of him where he had a will he had a desire and then this man had a communion with the father and made his will subject to the father's will in his own personal life says contending with himself so there was things that jesus would have thought of and things that would have been presented to him things that he would have had to overcome and the bible says by obedience he by through the things which he suffered learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and he became perfect through that what was this it was contending with himself he says he overcame by obedience to the word in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word so if you're contending with yourself which we all do our worst enemy is our self and i know there's that one person that is a really close second but our our worst enemy is ourselves and that's the only uh that's the only only way that we can truly begin to overcome is when you recognize that you're part of your uh enemy so he says contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word now i'm going to take a quote from how can i overcome and i'm going to break it up into three different statements and kind of separate them out so that we can i just study this in a little bit more detail not a lot of detail but just a few more aspects because he's speaking about overcoming by the word and i'm doing this in the context of us recognizing that there's uh there's powers that influence a group there's powers that influence the individuals in that group i'm speaking to you as a church speaking to you as a body of believers that god has called together supernaturally has called together is bringing together to be a local body and so we we have this opportunity at the genesis of something to think about how god wants to shape us and to begin to let the word have the preeminence not politics not pretense not popularity but let the word have the preeminence so that we have a pattern within our own uh our own dna of how we ought to act and how we ought to think and how that we ought to treat others and be motivated to be a light to others be motivated to to do more than just come to church but be empowered through these gatherings through our fellowship with one another to be overcomers in our personal life and so in this uh and we're using this parable of who is my neighbor to challenge ourselves uh to have the right kind of attitude and obey the word so how can we overcome these negative influences that are even ingrained in our our human psyche ingrained in our human behavior how can we overcome it by the word now brother branham says and how can overcome overcome means to stand the test you've heard it said before we all want a testimony but we don't want to test can't get a testimony without a test and so to overcome means to stand the test in ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 it says put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil so you're going to be tested not just in an innocent way but you're going to be tested by the devil we realize this whole evil age is to prove that you're not like eve that you're not that type of a woman so you as an individual are going to come in contact with the temptation of the enemy you're going to have to contend with yourself which is your worst enemy you're going to have to wrestle out your own salvation with fear and trembling there's things that you're going to be tested on things are going to need to be made firm and made sure so it says put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles the cunning arts the deceit the craft or the trickery of the devil so the devil's just not you know just sitting there waving his right hand saying here i'm coming with a with a right hook and so you know what's coming but he's going to try to be deceitful he's going to try to be crafty or trick you it's his cunning arts so we what we need the whole armor of god to be able to stand we need the whole arm of god in order to overcome because overcome means to stand the test and brother man said he fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word so the whole armor of god is the word of god and we need to use the word in order to stand against the personal temptation of satan satan will tempt us personally in order to stand against it we must use the word to stand against it in james chapter 1 verse 14 it says but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed so there's the test we need to overcome means to stand the test it doesn't mean you're going to be without temptation doesn't mean you're not going to be without something coming to buffet you to challenge you to get you cause you to begin to think well am i right am i wrong do i really believe do i really have the holy ghost those those are challenges that we all face and not we don't always face them all the time but we've all at some point or another been challenged in certain areas and when we pass the test then there's it's a way of making that firm so that when the devil comes around and tries to pick her on that you say no sorry pass that test and so there's a way that the devil comes to us and he tempts us different avenues different weaknesses different levels of temptation and each one of us have a personal temptation and personal temptations and if we have if we could as a church collective as a body a local church collectively be tempted there's ways that we can all be tempted together but it says every man is tempted when he's drawn away from his own lust and enticed now james continues to expound upon this how that once it's conceived then you when lust is conceived then it brings forth uh sin but we're just looking at the dynamics of you now under personal temptation being confronted with something and we're recognizing that the dynamics how that you would come to a place where lust can be deceived you have to first be drawn away of your own lust and there has to be an enticement not just the temptation but an enticement not just saying would you do you want to do this or you should do that or you should be feeling this way or you should go do this but rather the enticement where it seems to hook you and i want you to when we read this when every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed think about your instinct as a human think about your base nature and not tempted to sin like the thieves not tempted to lust attempted to do drugs and tempted to steal from your neighbor and i'm not i'm those this is applicable to those temptations and temptation to to do things that defile your body but rather just think now about the priest and the levite think about your base nature your base instinct in other ways whether it be social ways or personal opinions of others and different things what leads you to act critically what would lead you to treating someone harshly what would cause you to to judge with prejudice or to do something that would be unkind it's it's all within this same temptation it's not that there's a category of of sins that are deal with lust and perversion and fornication and that's when a man is tempted and that's when a man is enticed to do anything contrary to the word operates according to the same the same rules you're drawn away from the word of god you're enticed to have an attitude towards someone that's not pleasing to the lord you're enticed to judge someone incorrectly that's unfair it's all according to the same dynamics so we're not thinking about being tempted like a thief would be to rob somebody but rather how the priest and the levite would see man in need and would pass by him and i said how am i tempted to mistreat someone how do i treat somebody how how can i be neighbor to the less fortunate and in doing so recognize these impulses these instincts or the enticements or my own lust my innocent uh the innocent biases that dwell within my thought process by a natural birth and so we we're standing this personal temptation we're contending with ourselves overcome means to stand the test overcome means to recognize when i'm being drawn away by my own lust my own desires my own opinions my own draw something and then we recognize that oh wait a minute something's happening here and then you fire something towards it say wait a minute hold on stop i i'm becoming more and more conscious of it and i i i think it's something that if as you become more conscious you might say well this is really discouraging i'm beginning to think my first thoughts aren't very good that's great because before you never thought about it but now you're thinking about it man my first thought is to assume the worst and my first thought is to think this and my first thought when i see that is these instincts well if you're gonna be that way i'm gonna be this way but now i'm starting to realize whoa wait a minute and it's okay that first thought it's you have it but the challenge is saying wait a minute hold on let me run that through the word filter let me check whether or not this is pleasing to the lord is this something that's going to bring god glory is this for that person's benefit is this for my his edification for my growth and my benefit it's pausing now you're all familiar with these statements and they're all reside together within one paragraph but the man says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks so overcome means to stand the test that's one part of it and it means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks so you cannot overcome unless you have recognized a trick of the enemy you've recognized which means to know or to recall to mind to recover knowledge it means you remember i recognize this i remember this this is the test i've been here before i've done that or i've been told before i've been warned beforehand this is how the devil operates this is how he works overcomes to means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks if there's anything you could take away from this it's that the word of god says that you can and have the ability to recognize every single one of his tricks devil there's not one scheme you can pull on us that god can't expose there's not one trap there's not one weakness there's not one lie there's not anything that you've been scheming to do for 6 000 years that i have not been commanded by the word to recognize brother john and i were fellowshipping a couple weeks ago on the way to church and how that you if you're required to do something and you have a responsibility what good is the responsibility if you haven't been given the power to fulfill it if you haven't been authorized with the authority to to to meet the responsibility it's your responsibility to to sweep this floor but you don't have the authority to go get the broom you don't have the authority to come in the room and sweep the floor what what is the responsibility without the authority to fulfill the responsibility god has not given you the responsibility to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks without giving you the authority to do so without authorizing you and given you the authority to recognize these tricks and so this is part of our overcoming to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks in second corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 paul says lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices and let me phrase it this way because we are not ignorant of his devices we don't let satan take advantage of us because we recognize the devil and his tricks i don't put myself in a position to be taken advantage of so you don't even have to know and see the trap you just have to know that's a trap he lays i know that if i do this i know i'm putting myself in a ground to compromise i know that if i do this this is where this say this is where satan take advantage of me so we when we overcome it's to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and because we are not ignorant of his devices it means even his mental perceptions thought process and even his purpose so it's his ambition we're not ignorant of his ambition and we're not ignorant of his imprint on the human thinking his imprint on the human thought process his imprint in his programming brother bam teaches us that he has designed the modern woman well not only has he designed the modern woman but he's designed our modern thinking to to be manipulated and be controlled by human things so we're subject to these temptations we're subject to biases we're subject to weaknesses i want to conform i want to fit in i i want to i want to achieve i want to be successful he says because we're not ignorant of his devices we do not let satan get take advantage of us and in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 he's specifically referring to how a lack of forgiveness by a body by a church can give satan an exploitable advantage so i want you to think about this the context of verse 11 is him of him saying that we're not ignorant of his devices and because we're not ignorant of his devices we'll conduct ourselves in a certain way so that we do not let satan get the advantage of us and notice what verse 10 says says to whom you forgive anything i forgive also for if i forgave anything to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgive i it in the person of christ so paul is saying if you have a body as a body have forgiven him then i also forgive him unless this perception that i have not forgiven him becomes an exploitable weakness in this person's mind and in his heart so paul is willing to humble himself and join with others who have forgiven this one who committed a horrible sin anybody read it and know what it is in first corinthians it's it was an awful you know what we could say at a very fornication like oh yeah that's bad but it was really bad i mean if you have degrees and levels of it it was something like how could you let this happen how could this be going on the church and paul rebukes them and he exposes it you know what the church did they did what they were supposed to do and he said i find that you have made this right and the one that had done it repented and made things right he says as you have forgiven him i forgive him also so that lest satan should get an advantage of us we're not ignorant of his devices i realize that and if i could put it in this way he says he's referring to how a lack of forgiveness can create an advantage that satan would want to exploit he's specifically saying that satan exploits our treatment of others to that person and our own detriment the way we treat someone satan can exploit it the words we say how many times has he just taken the things we've said and we haven't really given much thought and it didn't come out the right way and it's like man satan just seems to grab a hold of it and just it makes it makes it hit with a lot more punch than we meant to we might have meant to cause a little bit of hurt but man he just takes it and he ramps it up and it causes a lot more hurt and then when we go to apologize like man i didn't know you were that sensitive i mean get some thicker skin paul realizes no we the way we treat others creates an ex something a scenario a thought process a feeling a a complex that satan can exploit so within the context of forgiveness as the body has forgiven paul also wanted to forgive because he realized that satan can take advantage of the way one is feeling so he took the responsibility himself to be sure that nothing he said or did gave put put a weakness in that person's spirit for satan to take advantage of it and he also says that lest he would take advantage of us paul realized that even his attitude and his behavior could leave a weakness within the body within himself so he was wanted to forgive with the others unless satan would take advantage of him he says because we're not ignorant of his devices he's like this is something satan would love to get a hold of loves to find something like this and just wear somebody out with it make him feel small make him feel weak make him feel like an outcast make him feel reluctant to not serve and reluctant to not go to church oh he really loves to work that in so we are we overcome by standing the test we overcome by recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks and then the next part and this is a necessary component now to overcoming to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is and everybody says it as i've kind of parsed this out in a way to where we just weren't reading the statement at the same time that you recognize that he's a devil that's always at the same time that you recognize he's a devil and he wants you and he's after you you have to also recognize at the same time that the god that is in you is greater and mightier than the devil and that the one that's in you has already overcome him do you realize how horribly overwhelming it would be for you to truly recognize the devil in every one of his tricks i know a lot of us are arrogant just because we know how to play chess we think we can just beat anybody in chess and then you finally play somebody in chess you're like well i don't think i've ever played chess before and because you realize man there's so many more moves and there's i mean there's so many other this guy's thinking a million miles ahead of me and if you if you really could see how satan plays chess no matter how many years i've got in this game he's got thousands more than me no matter how strong i think i am he's craftier than i am a man who thinks he standeth beware lest he fall i'm not standing on my own i'm standing because he stood i'm standing in a firm foundation i'm staying on something solid because he's placed me there he set me there so you can't you don't want to just merely recognize the devil in every one of his tricks because if you're honest with yourself you're like how in the world could i ever overcome any one of these tricks it's just like the sleight of hand and a magic trick you know what's coming and you know there's not real sorcery that they actually made it disappear though some people actually think that pin and teller can catch a bullet in their teeth you know you know there's more to this right you know this is slightly hand there's there's some trickery going on but you couldn't figure it out you couldn't do it and if you i'm gonna i'm gonna catch it this time i'm gonna catch it this time there it goes again you can't catch it so then you realize it's not just there's got to be something greater there's got to be a discernment there's got to be a power and so listen if you thought oh i can recognize every one of his tricks oh i know what you're doing devil i'm going to get you i knew of a young man who said one time he testified that he said one time about the devil he said that devil he goes i got the devil's number just says this arrogantly in a group of young people and as far as i know to this day he has not been able to recover from homosexuality makes a comment like that i got the devil's number in a very arrogant way and i'm not saying it was that statement alone that was his own demise but we can't have that kind of arrogance when we look i can recognize the devil and every one of his tricks bring it devil come on no at the same time you've got to recognize that through christ you're more than a match for the devil and that you can overcome him because he that is in you has already done it i have this precedent i have the overcomer inside of me that's the basis upon which i can overcome and so in first john chapter four verse four and you'll notice there's this uh continuity with first john and james on some of these things as we've read already first john chapter two and james chapter one here in first john chapter four verse four year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you've overcome the antichrist in the world you've overcome the worldliness you've overcome these things why because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world this is why we overcome and when we're bowed down when we recognize just how weak we are when we've made a mistake and we're and we're made very conscious and self-aware of how weak we are and i keep making the same mistake we want to say i'm so stupid i'm so foolish how come i keep doing this realize in that moment that that's a product of your own weakness and that you don't overcome because you're strong you overcome because he already overcame him and greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world if you failed then realize it's not him that failed it was you that failed and that all you've got to do is yield to him and there'll be no failure amen do not lose hope that he's not able we do not lose hope that he has not promised we realize that if i have if i have fallen it's not him that has fallen it is i that have fallen and is he that will pick me up and is he that will overcome when this test comes again because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world so now there's a component of recognizing human weakness recognizing our own human tendencies and then even recognizing satan and his schemes we in our own personal life continuing with ourselves we realize overcoming means to stand the test i need to put on the whole armor of god i need to overcome these personal temptations but then i also have to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks his evil schemes his plans his trickeries so i recognize my human weaknesses i recognize group dynamics i recognize these different heuristics and biases and these tendencies in my own life even family strains this is the weakness in the family we've got all these things but that's only a part of overcoming you could actually identify every single genetic weakness in your family identify every single predispo predisposition you have by worldly nature and worldly nurture i know all my weaknesses i know all my sinful tendencies i know i've got a temper i know i have this problem i know i have that problem i know the devil i know what he's doing he's around the corner right now he's about to ambush me you could know all those things and if you don't recognize greater is he even though i guess it was gi joe that said and knowing is half the battle that's only half the battle amen we must recognize there's a greater power in us a transforming power a power to bring things subject i cannot within myself of my own humanity see humanity get under my humanity i need something greater i need divinity i need deity on this inside of me i need the spirit of christ that says to sit down i keep under my body by the spirit of christ i bring it under subjection paul even uses the language says i beat my body up i punch it i buffer it i keep it under subjection i make it hurt why because it's by the power of christ which is inside of us it's a transforming power that's the power that i've got to recognize is greater than any weakness in my flesh any tendency that's been in my family any power of economics or social uh social things in the world today greater is he that is in me than all that is in the world all the politics all the economics it's greater than all the political ads greater than all the polls greater than everything now james chapter 4 verse 7 this is a very familiar scripture but unfortunately the part that's most familiar is resist the devil he'll flee from you and we use that just resist the devil brother resist the devil sister he'll flee and we miss the most important part submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you you probably some of you may be familiar with the phrase resistance is futile its resistance without submission is futile that's exactly what the bible's saying resist all you want but if you have not submitted it's futile resistance is futile if you have not submitted so the bible's saying you must first yield to the word of god you must first submit yourself to god and only by first submitting to god have you been put in a position of proper resistance to cause the devil to flee that's why it hasn't worked you say well i resisted the devil i said i rebuked you satan and i did this and i did that but if you have not first submitted yourself to god there really is no shove there really is no push the devil's like seriously you you think you're resisting me this is just you talking this is just you spouting words this is just you trying to make something happen and then all it plays for the devil thing is oh yeah i got him now i'm going to come after him then you realize oh wait a minute lord i submit myself to you i stand i stand in my place i make things right i repent lord i submit myself to you and the satan comes and says i rebuke you satan i resist you and it's through the submission that you channel the supernatural power of god to resist the devil and to cause him to flee the devil flees from your submission more than it is your resistance submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will he will flee from you there's no he may he might he's going to consider it he's going to run the the metrics on it and the algorithm and going to see if this is the time to flee now if you have submitted yourselves to god and you resist the devil he will flee and so this scripture here in ephesians chapter 4 verses 22 to 24 i felt like it just really captured we'd used it last time but i felt it really captured these things that were were pondering in this overcoming and these personal temptations and these weaknesses in our flesh and in our mind paul writing ephesians chapter 4 verses 22 to 24 as he's talking about he's taught us not to walk as gentile walks who walk in the vanity of their mind their understanding is darkened and he just talks about how they're corrupt according to deceitful lust and so we could we could have read all that just to say that there's this idea that we have by our first birth we're all gentiles any jews present make you declare yourself but he's talking about the gentiles and the vanity of their mind they walk a certain way they have no promise they are not heirs and so they're disconnected from god and his promises they're disconnected from a promise of a messiah so they only live to their by their base instincts just need to eat i need to drink i need to be clothed i need to have a place to live i need i i need bartering uh a power the all these things he said we ought not to live that way and he brings it down that we then ought to says that ye put off concerning the formal conversation the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust these are the lusts that james talked about that were drawn away by these are the devices in our hearts these are the tendencies this is what you contend with yourself in this life that we once lived the former conversation the former way of life he said we ought to put off this because it was a corrupt according to the deceitful lust he describes it as the old man put off he says the old man that means lay aside or cast away your old way of thinking your old way of acting your old manner of life it would be nice just to do an audit sometime of the habits and the ideas the sayings the the the whatever it might be the the recreations however you want to describe it and just say what let me take inventory what's here what's residual from the old man what are the things i say and do that's just really the product of this old man and his deceitful lust and not be afraid to do some house cleaning you know what i don't really need that around i don't really need that instinct i don't need that habit i don't need that catchphrase i don't need to be doing those things and so he said lay it aside cast it away put off the the old man and verse 23 says and be renewed in the spirit of your mind there's the transforming power be renewed in the spirit of your mind so the renewing it's going to be a changing of your mind humans think this way this is the way i thought as a migiri this is the way i thought as a texan this is the way i thought as an american this is the way i thought as a republican this is the way i thought as a lawyer this is the way that i thought this is the way that this person thought by all natural influence in nature that he was born with but now i want to renew my mind i want the mind of christ i have the premise i actually want my character to be changed i want this the spirit of me to be perfected do we not believe in a perfection that to where it's not just a perfect soul and one day a perfect body could you imagine that sandwich in the millennium got a perfect body and a perfect soul and an imperfect spirit as the meat in there somewhere no you're gonna have your god is perfecting character now god is perfecting your spirits now that's the beauty of this life that we're living it's not that man once i'm sealed by the holy ghost well if everybody else would just catch up no i'm i'm i'm in the i'm in the trenches now i need to grow to maturity i need to be perfected god perfect my spirit renew the spirit of my mind change my way of thinking and then verse 24 that ye put on the new man which after god which like god is created in righteousness and true holiness this phrase put on the new man it means be endued endued with the new man be arrayed in the new man and the idea is he says put off the former conversation put on the new man put off the old man put on the new man it's speaking of a garment or clothing and the phrase actually speaks of sinking into clothing you just sink into it you yield to his life that is in you i'm going to sink into his image i'm going to fall into his likeness i'm going to come into this new man i'm going to get myself out of the way the new man actually means unprecedented unheard of uncommon you can say well that's just the way the word is used in other places okay i'll i'll accept that but if you really do put on the new man he's unheard of he's certainly not common we could we not all except at least in our own lives it was unprecedented because he hadn't been there yet until we were born again but this man this daughter of god this son of god his nature's unprecedented when it comes to human behavior it's unheard of when it comes to human thinking it's uncommon when it comes to human acting it's something opposite to the expected norm so you have these this former life this former manner of living which was corrupted by deceitful lies paul's saying stop acting that way have your mind renewed and put on the new man because that old way that's a common way that's the human way everyone does it that way but you need to put on the sinking to the new man which is unprecedented which is unheard of which is uncommon something opposite to what is expected by people in your station by people in your str your strat of life and your social economic status the people in your position this is unheard of people like you typically act this way you're waspy white anglo-saxon protestant you should be thinking this way you should be acting that way but no no no i've been born again i'm a new creature in christ jesus i don't act waspy i act christ-liked listen we ought to not become so oh i better be careful i'm a pause i'm going to think about this we ought not become so aligned with our politics we adopt the manners and the beliefs and the ideas of a political party just carte blanche whatever it is yeah i just checked the box you know just vote but just vote by you realize just how opposite the people of the world are in any political party did brother branham not say they're both corrupt so let's try to whitewash one of them and make them out to be messiahs and make them out to be the you know the bastions of truth and oh my what we need is we need to put a you know this party in every office and then we'll see god have his way again with america america's rejected god so if you think god is animating right now joe biden and god is animating uh donald trump you've lost it you don't even believe the message anymore and so we're not identified and i i encourage you to vote do your civic duty but know exactly what arena you're dealing in and realize that at the end of the day satan is in charge of all these kingdoms and god will use satan's ambition to fulfill his word so what we need is the word that makes all these modern events made clear to us understand the prophecies that's been given and not get caught up in the atmosphere and the politics of it and be uncommon and unheard of actually be by the spirit of christ that person who could not get the rancor and the vitriol of all the people who are so political riled up to where we could talk to a democrat we could talk to republican we can have conversations and not be the one instigating and provoking and meeting and ferocity and spitting at one another and getting all mad and leaving coffee and key in the car of the person who's got the biden sticker he's unheard of it's uncommon and you know it's it's a challenge to act the opposite way to what is naturally instinctive it's a challenge this new man unprecedented unheard of uncommon the opposite of what you would expect to someone it's a challenge to act opposite to that many times it's not even socially acceptable you're expected to act a certain way you're expected to conform this is the way we ought to think this is the way we ought to act this is what we ought to do and it might have been expected of a priest to pass on by it might have been expected the levite to pass on by but jesus is specifically implying that they should have stopped and helped because they were required to buy the word they would have done something which would have been unprecedented can you believe it that priest was on the schedule to ogre for sacrifice yet tomorrow but he stopped and he helped this man who was half dead and now he's gonna he's gonna purge himself he's not gonna offer soccer he's gonna take seven days off like that's unheard of to take that risk can you believe it but that's what they ought to have done and the way it strikes me in all these things really is that overcoming is doing the opposite of what you're being pressured to do doing the opposite of what the world would want you to do doing the opposite of what satan wants you to do you're you're you're going the different going a different way and these are three questions that brother branham's asked and i failed to write it down because i just to piece these out as separate questions i don't have the slides for these because i want to go through them uh without necessarily just projecting a slide and focusing on the slide but he's asked these questions in question and answers and i want to go through three of them and i want to read his answer this is the person's questions questions three question 389 and i believe these are all from when he was answering questions in the summer of 64. he says when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this should it be if he was the only child should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early youth so if a person has a complex and inferiority complex whatever complex then how can he overcome it and he says in the context of maybe being an only child so you think it's only child it doesn't know how to get along with others selfish you know you know difficult playing by the rules or whatever it might be brother answers this question of how you can overcome a complex or an inferiority complex or the nature that maybe someone would have if they were only child early on in the youth he says take exactly the opposite now i remember reading these one time and i tried to take it from the standpoint of a person asking these questions who didn't have the holy ghost i thought man i would be terribly frustrated with his answer he says just take exactly the opposite it's almost as if yeah easy take exactly the opposite next question but he says take exactly the opposite if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way so he's talking to i'm not pointing to any of you but he said you this this brat that only wants to you that always wants to have your way turn right back around and get everything you got the other way he has to be speaking to something greater in the brat because if the brat tells the brat you know to give everything away the brat's going to say uh uh right so this isn't psychology with the brat he's actually telling this person it has the holy ghost you want to overcome something you have an inferiority complex you you're selfish because of the way that you're raised you take exactly the opposite dig deep and find there's something inside of you that says when i want to be selfish i'm going to be giving when i'm only concerned about myself i'm going to be concerned about others is if you only want your way and your little breath that always wants to have everything your way turn right back around and give everything you got the other way if you want it to be this way then you step back and make sure it's another way it could be that way with just how everybody sits at a table at a restaurant um so let's see you sit here you sit there you sit there and you say here this is the way it needs to be oh no no don't mess this up this is perfect just take a step back and let everybody sit where they want to sit and you might be going the whole time greater is he that is in me greater is he and you what you'll be an overcomer pf changs there's a plug for mr fleming so he says turn everything and give everything you've got the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got doesn't that just i love how the word isn't going to kind of dance around it like some kind of psychology well what you need to do no he just says you're selfish give stuff away i i don't even need to enroll i don't need to listen to an audio book i don't need to i don't need to be hypnotized and so begin to think about when you first begin to have this problem you're getting very sleepy no i just do the opposite i'm a christian i'm a born-again believer i'm selfish i'm stingy just do the opposite do you realize how much you deny yourself when you live selfishly yeah let me just use a very uh innocent example if you don't want someone eating your food you'll never ask to eat somebody else's do you really realize how many bites you've missed out on if you're just open hey can i try that go for it can i try yours go for it but since you're selfish you would never think to ask to borrow right unless you're the worst kind of narcissist you know that you do have those i would never let you borrow my shovel can i have your rake we're just talking about how much you can deny yourself because you're selfish you think this way i would never ask somebody for that because i would never i would never want them to ask me that right and there's a way that brother brown was like breaking these ideas and these molds and these character thought processes say look if you have a tendency do the opposite that's his advice this is godly counsel if you're selfish you want to hold on to everything then start giving away what you got he says just go the vice versa i'm selfish i have a hard time i don't like to i don't like to give things away give things away start you realize how good it feels to not be selfish it really is how bound up and even how physically sick someone can be when they're so selfish then start giving away and their spirit begins to relax and their health begins to come back just go the vice versa that's the way to overcome anything is the antidote the antidote means the antidote the remedy against the poison what's the poison in my thought process what's the poison in my thinking what's the poison the way that i view others what would i instinctively do by the old man to somebody who's backslid what would i instinctively do to the old man to somebody who's left my church what would i instinctively do to somebody who's hurt me or harm me and what's the new way that ought to be thinking so that a root of bitterness does not come up so i'm not prejudiced so i don't close the door so that i'm not the one that pushes somebody away when they're just begging for somebody to bring them back and call them back the antidote is the remedy against the poison the vice versa so he says take exactly the opposite i think this is profound i just weighed in with my opinion on it i think it's profound if you have an inferiority complex some sort of complex a selfishness a stinginess take the opposite do something uncommon do something unprecedented that brother he's selfish he's boy he's stingy and he gives something away unprecedented uncommon but you know what overcoming so brother branham's asked this question it's question 405 brother branham when someone gets on me or steps on my toes as the old saying is my temper rises natural correct say that natural instinct otherwise you just don't have feeling maybe how can i overcome this thing i know the lord's will would have to do it the lord will have the lord will have to do excuse me i know the lord will have to do it but what can i do in my heart i don't want this thing beautiful acknowledges that it's going to take something from the lord but then take some responsibility to themselves how can i overcome my temper brother graham says sweeten your temper with prayer so if you have a temper sweeten it with prayer there's something you can do prayer sweetens our emotions tempers them tampers them down takes them and if they're out of 11 brings them down a notch because they take them down down further and further and further sweeten your temper with prayer he says then make up your mind pray then make up your mind there's actually a resolve where you say you know what i'm not gonna get angry i'm not going to let this bother me i'm going to die to it if we could learn the that we have the power to die to things oh my goodness can i just testify for a moment i'd love to have an organ right now just really working it over because i just want to testify when i learned that i could die to things i was liberated i could become free that's horrible that's awful oh that just really really bothers me you know what i'm just gonna die to it you know what i'm fine i'm gonna pray for that situation i hope the lord gets his way in that i'm gonna be glorified somehow how can i help i'm not bothered by this i'm dead to it the ability to die to things that one time just eat at you and bother you and you're not you're not the problem you're not part of the solution what are you what are you worried about it for die to it the ability to just make up your mind i'm not gonna let that bother me you actually have power over it to just make that decision no this passive aggressiveness this narcissistic behavior this this needling me this picking on me all these dif i'm not gonna let it bother me we have to see ourselves as the eagles sitting there out in that field while that squirrel is just chirping away let them chirp all they want let them say what they want about you about where you fellowship about what you believe let them chirp all day long all you gotta do just lift right above it you're not squirrels you don't have a squirrel mentality as an eagle you could create a squirrel don't let him bother you he says then make up your mind he says i don't guess there's too many people in this building that have ever had any more temper than i did to begin with oh i had a mouth mashed all the time and i'd taken a lot of my meals out of a straw he's getting into fights why through a fence you offend me you pick on me you say something about me we're going to fight them fighting words all right you're going to go ahead and start swinging now it's important to note that as brother badam walks through this he's going to identify that this nature to fight died when he was born again and when you see a brawler there's a question mark there's a question mark on a brawler's experience because there's got to be when someone's quick to fight and when i say fight not just pick a argument but will actually physically assault somebody that's problematic and so what you that person would need to do if you are born again you must realize greater is he that is in you but if someone is characterized as a brother one that you know could physically punch you physically lay their hands on you physically assault you but everyone's identified there's something wrong with this attitude so if you have a temper you as a born-again believer sweeten your life with prayer your temper with prayer then make up your mind he says i used to have a mashed mouth all the time i'd taken a lot of meals out of a straw in other words he got mad at somebody because they offended him he got in a fight and he could no longer chew my mother's you know was a half indian and my father was an irishman a kentucky irish at that and both of them had enough temper to fight a buzz saw and all the time my mouth was mashed i was little to begin with and they'd just pick me up and knock me down and i'd get up again they'd knock me down again so i just got too unable to get up anymore that's always and then when i got able to get up i got up again they knocked me down again so that's just the way i had it i thought i can never be a christian but when the holy spirit came into my life that done it no more greater is he that is in you now this is an answer now i don't believe that what brother branham is trying to imply is this person who has a temper doesn't have the holy ghost but he's certainly making the point if you don't have it you're probably always going to be subject to that alone there's no nothing else to bring a subject when the holy spirit came to might that done it no more i had a woman one time i went to have the to cut the lights off and that day i had hair on top of my head at and he says and that day i had hair on top of my head she said you little kinky-headed idiot i told her said woman you ought to curse like that oh don't you fear god she said you little kinky-headed idiot if i wanted somebody to talk to me about those things i wouldn't get a halfwit like you whoo then she called me a blankety blank name oh my it had been a year farther i always said a man that strike a woman wasn't man enough to strike a man but i might have broke that at that time calling my mother a bad name like that he found the exception so this woman really pushed his buttons he said if it had just been a year earlier he would have said i've always had this rule that a man will hit a woman is not man enough to hit a man but i found my exception you know this world up and let her have he says but i might have broke it for that time calling my mother a bad name like that but you know what it never even phased me i said i'll pray for you never bothered i knowed right then something had happened to me i thank god that we have those things in our lives we realize something's happened to us this use this would have bothered me before something's transformed something's changed whether it be by virtue of the new birth or the maturing of your character and your spirit say that doesn't bother me anymore we're grateful to god when you say something happened i said if you have a temper sweeten your temper with prayer then make up your mind instead of fighting do the opposite of what the instinct is fight back say something back well if you don't say something back or you're going to do something no not my battle battle's the lords question 330. he said brother branham this is the question how am i supposed to show my wife that i really care for her and yet stay with the word but still have a question like this said why don't you practice what you preach or believe okay this is interesting how can i show my wife love and stay with the word when she's always saying why don't you practice what you preach or believe so he's acknowledging that within the context of a marriage and it could be assumed that he does love his wife and they're together but yet she doesn't believe what he believes so whenever he does something that's not he does something she uses what he believes against her against him and he's like this is a low blow this is cheap how can i keep loving my wife that's always throwing what i believe in my face how can i stay with the word and i don't know what word he might have been thinking about you know how can i stay with the word and you know i always had this word a man that hits a woman's not man enough to strike another man how can i stay with that when she sits there and throws this in my face why don't you practice what you preach or believe listen to his answer well then if the wife is saying this to you when she has a right to say it you better get right i love how the word deals with the one who professes the word somebody has an unbelieving spouse and the count the counsel doesn't go to the unbelieving spouse it goes to the believing spouse that this is what you can do this is what you're empowered to do you have a power you have a grace you have you can have a resolve and it's a word that's given to this man hey i'm in a bad situation here what can i do says well if he if she's thrown in your face and has a right to do it then you better get right since then if she's saying it just to be evil remember the bible said it was better than a millstone was hanging around your neck and drown in the depths of the sea then even defend the least of these my little ones now then that puts the this idea on the believing spouse's heart to realize oh my this isn't trivial the way they're treating me is an offense to god they're not just abusing you emotionally they're just not verbally abusing you they're just not manipulative or controlling of you they're actually doing this to a son or daughter of god brother i said hey if they're doing that to be evil just remember that if they do something like this to a little one of god a child of god it'd be better that a meal still be hung around their neck that's to provoke care or concern then for the other person not be like ha ha i forgot about that thanks brother branham next time she says son how's that millstone hanging huh i mean it's to provoke concern or care like oh my i don't want that to be i love her he goes now just that's just your question he says and maybe that this wife is not that type of person maybe she's not an evil person maybe she's not doing it maliciously maybe she's different maybe she's a good person maybe she's just testing you to see what you do so he says now stay in love with her and let her see jesus in you you do that he says so brother just be salty so brother just be salty she'll get thirsty if there's anything in her to thirst for do the opposite of what's instinctive because i realize that in your instinct you'd wanna you you wanna fight back that your instinct is maybe not to love your instinct is withdraw yourself he's saying you be salty stay in love with her he says how can i how am i supposed to show my wife that i care for her when she's always throwing this in my face don't let it affect you do the opposite of what someone would normally do in this situation meet the the criticism with the same intensity oh yeah well you're not a christian yourself and just fireworks back and forth guns are blazing why don't you practice what you preach or believe he's saying just stay in love with her let her see jesus in you just be salty he says because she could be testing you in each one of these questions i i felt to kind of walk through these because and i realized maybe i didn't do them justice and because of the timing and getting time getting away from us and you could have dealt more specifically with some of the nuances of each one of these scenarios but the counsel that brother branham's given giving it's opposite to what you would instinctively want to do in each situation we acknowledge this is good godly counsel take the opposite sweeten your temp with prayer and make up your mind and and let the holy ghost change you and just stay salty just stay in love with her it's really challenging the believer and this these could only be questions answered this way to someone who already has the holy ghost otherwise you'd say well you guys need counseling for sure because you're both going to have to moderate your behavior and your thinking to get on the same page and not that counseling is wrong in the context of holy spirit believers but he's actually in that with in the absence of counseling recognizing a solution as brother harold beckham said divorce is is too selfish people living under the same roof in other words if one person will be self-sacrificial if one person would be willing to say you know what i'll sacrifice myself i'll humble myself i'll be salty i'll get beneath him he said that's enough to turn the thing turn things around and i want to bring it to a close with this as we're looking at putting on the new man taking off the old man and doing the opposite the samaritan represents the rule breaker he did what was unprecedented he did what was uncommon or unexpected he was the outlier all these data points would all be lumped together the priests the levite and even maybe the samaritans they all would have passed on by they all would have been found within this particular segment but then a certain samaritan the bible just doesn't say any samaritan a certain samaritan this was one that was an outlier this wasn't one that was maybe even like all other samaritans certainly wasn't like the priest or the levite he wasn't like every other man that walked by that way he was an outlier they had been taking a poll and by the polls that have been taken they would say that the group of thieves and the priests and the levite they'd say that you know so far three out of three don't like this guy and then finally one comes along and you have this outlier it doesn't fit within the data set doesn't fit with the trend doesn't fit with the norm he's way outside the what would be expected he didn't even conform to the stereotypes of the three of the two that passed by the priest and levi they would have been expected to stop the samaritan may have been given a pass well i mean these guys don't really get along anyways when it came time when jesus met the woman at the well in john chapter 4 verse 9 said woman give me a drink this is her first instinct then saith the woman of samara unto him how is it that thou being a jew asked asketh drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans she's immediately recognizing that this is not normal for a jew to ask a samaritan for a drink of water it would not be expected for one of us to ask the other for something nor would it be expected that the other would acquiesce and grant what was what requested she said this is bizarre you're a jew i'm a samaria samaritan i'm a samarian i'm not somebody you would normally talk to let alone ask a question of ask for a drink by our social norms and what's socially accepted i could say forget you i'm not getting you a drink get your own jew but this is this is this is just drawing attention to the fact that the samaritan didn't conform to what would have been socially acceptable at the time what he would have been given a pass if he had walked on by it example it is an example to me this amplifies john 4 9 amplifies his willingness to do the right thing and then if you look at luke chapter 10 verse 35 i know we didn't read it tonight but we'll read it now his willingness to do the right thing then influenced others because he he acted alone but for him acting this man probably would have died and but for him acting no one else would have been given an opportunity such as this host to likewise help and i want to phrase it this way though i don't think it's apparent in the text and if i'm taking some liberty please forgive me if it's too much and on the morrow when he departed because he went and went to an end took him to an end had the man stay with him and on the moral he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend this more when i come again i will repay thee and i'm assuming this but i believe it's implied by the text that the host of this inn took the two pence and this man who was beaten and wounded and was willing to take the two pence and use it for his care and then spend of his own in trust that this man would return and pay him back and this inspired then the host to do something that would be going above and beyond what an innkeeper would normally do this this inspires now the host sees this and maybe he recognized this man who's beaten and he recognized this is a man this is a man this is the jew that stayed with me before i recognize this man and a samaritan brings him in maybe he knew the path to know well enough who had passed by that day also i saw a priest go by and he didn't bring this guy in i saw levite go in i i just gave a room to a levite he didn't stop and help this guy and a samaritan does and if this man may have if he had crawled up to this inn half naked half dead or naked and half dead the innkeeper said sorry this ain't a hospital but the samaritan because he acted in an uncommon way in an unprecedented way another was willing to do the same and again let's look at this slide for this group experiment remember this which line on the right is the same length as the line on the left does anyone know can we all just say it together c see c is now i'm not tricking you i'm all of a sudden going to put a ruler over here and it's a and you're like oh no need to reevaluate everything i've been thinking oh that's the right answer and so when they did this study one time they thought they they figured let's just do it a little bit differently you have five actors and one participant in the prior experi experiments five of them gave the wrong answer 97 percent of the time 75 percent of time i think another time is 67 of time the the participant the subject of the study joined the five and given the wrong answer then they redid the experiment and had four give the wrong answer and one give the right answer and they found that one actor all it took was one actor to give a different answer than the majority just one person tell the truth and conformity to the group was reduced to 36 percent from 97 in one study all they needed was one dissenter one outlier in the group a a a a c c that's all it took so they could have said 97 percent of time in this study the subject the participant gives the wrong answer when five people give the wrong answer and so it would have been expected a a a and then all you would say well this one would probably say a and maybe they begin to change their answer and they begin to purpose i'm going to say a but then all of a sudden someone says see and they're inspired to tell the truth they're inspired to do the right thing and this is what one of the studies concluded the present of a dissenter the presence rather the presence of a dissenter made it possible to deviate from the majority and give the right answer the dissenter and some of these studies were called blockers or objectors someone willing to say the truth someone willing to do what's right even when everyone else isn't doing it and i know it's easy for us just to put blinders on and think about the the ramifications of this with respect to the study but let's just think about our lives how people are treated politics and churches and and group dynamics and even in our neighborhoods and our families thanksgiving's coming up this is all really good teaching for family dynamics and during the holiday season right think about how we ought to be thinking differently acting differently not going along with the flow not allowing the crowd to influence us and it says all it took was for one to act differently than the rest and it empowered the next person to do the same you realize in the book of daniel daniel's the one that said hey you know what i don't want to eat the king's meat i don't want to drink the king's wine just give me vegetables one man said no and three others joined just one man that's the power of the dissenter that's the power of the blocker i'm so glad that in laodicea when the whole church world was going one way a little a little kentuckian named william branham stood up as an objector stood up as a dissenter stood up as a blocker and here you are and this is the part to me that is so remarkable oh my getting late we'll sing fewer songs the dissenter doesn't need to be popular the dissenter doesn't need to be charismatic or gifted or or one that would have a better view of the screen as it were they just had to be willing to stand and so they tested this they wanted to there's if you do a study and that's why if someone says well they did a study and they said that all these people you know um did this and did that you got it what kind of study was it was there proper controls in place what was the size of the group that they studied i mean it was only three people all three people got a sunburn when they were out in the sun so anybody who stands out in the sun is going to get a sunburn you want to you want to study a little bit more expansive than that and so they're trying to control for the whether or not what was actually a bias what was actually moving inside these people they controlled for it this way or actually presented the study differently this way and les the person who is objecting something about that person was the influencing factor on the the participant they took somebody and they put him in the room beforehand and i know i'm getting bogged down in the details of this but i hope it just strikes you with with some encouragement they took the participant and they put them in room in the room with the actor who would give the right answer and he had coke bottle glasses on and they put him in the room and they said you have to fill out this form and so this guy with the coke bottle glasses went in there and he said could you fill this out for me i can't see a thing or it might have been you have to write what's on this board down on this piece of paper you say hey i'm practically blind with these glasses on could you do this for me and so the participant was like man this guy's blind with glasses that thick you'd think he'd be able to magnify things you know all right fine fills it out they go into the room and lo and behold the question is asked you could put those lines up which line on the right is the same as the line on the left and all the well sighted people said a a a a a and then all of a sudden the blind guy goes see and that was enough to empower the participant to say see also because they weren't relying on that person's ability it wasn't that whether charismatic whether gifted didn't matter if the if the the everything was beautiful and well placed it was oh this is a fancy place or whatever it might be just the truth was lifted up all it took was one willing to stand they didn't have to be the best they didn't have to be the most popular didn't have to be the most gifted they just had to be one who could speak truth and that would empower the other one to say i stand for truth also and let me let me close with this and and i and i i not certain just how far the lord will continue to explore this subject to who is my neighbor and i want i've been inspired by certain things about the samaritan that i want to share with you but let me just maybe seal this part as we before we go deeply into who the samaritan is what i'm talking about now is this samaritan was willing to take a risk and i want you to see yourself as the samaritan in a world that's gone insane as a world that's gone crazy you are the gentile bride you're not the priest you're not the levi you're a spiritual king spiritual priest raised up as gentiles in this last day to be god's army to be god's bride and we also like whether it be this participant in this study or this dissenter we must like this outlier samaritan who is a rule breaker we must be willing to take the risk to endure the criticism to suffer rejection you have to be willing to take the risk and let me say this i'm looking at a people who are willing to do that the people who are here tonight are people who've walked this path willing to follow the leadership of the lord regardless of what the costs are and the things that god can do with people who are willing to risk popularity willing to risk social acceptance willing to break out of their comfort zone and what's normal to them willing to do things that they know is not the normal path willing to be do something unprecedented or unheard of willing to endure the pain for the moment knowing that there's glory that comes from pain willing to do the opposite that's what we must be willing to do and as a church we must be willing to do that i've been pondering this and it's just been really uh inspiring me and challenging me spiritual inertia is the death of a church and of our our personal joy you say spiritual inertia what kind of classes are you taking inertia it's just basically the principle that however something is it's going to remain that way the tendency to do nothing or to remain unchanged and that's that's that would be the death to a church that's the death of our spiritual joy that's the death of our spirituality when we're so inert we just remain as we are oh i've been this way for 40 years really i'm sure there's a lot of upsides to it a lot of positives but that's not the gospel we're walking in the light is always moving it doesn't say if we stand in the light as the light is always standing still we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us all our unrighteousness says if you walk in the light as he is in the light so you have to be walking in the light this inertia this just remaining unchanged remaining as they are the tendency to do nothing that's going to be the death of your spirituality and a certain samaritan walked by and did what every other samaritan every other jew would not have done and they did something uncommon did something unheard of and it made the difference in a person's life and i want you to likewise be challenged to break the spiritual inertia be willing to take the risk willing to be rejected willing to endure pain to see that christ is glorified and to do what is the hardest thing to do and that's change can you be willing to change let's stand to our feet guessing in the key of g creating me a clean heart let's make that our prayer tonight if you have a need you have that liberty a son or daughter of god to make your needs known to him whether you lift your hands to him or pour the words out from your lips come forward for prayer whatever it might be you have that you follow the leadership of the lord in your heart this is the prayer that i i want to bring together as a body lord i'm willing to change i'm willing to do things that are unprecedented i'm willing to do that which is uncommon you say lord create in me lord say tonight lord i'm putting on a new man i know it's challenging i know there's life circumstances that are very difficult i even realize that it's easy for someone to hear these things and create a general rule that we want to impose upon everybody and you know just like we're just trying to beat something into submission no that's not it but it's allowing ourselves to come under god's microscope say lord search my heart see if there be with our heads bowed i'd like to pray for god to change us our gracious heavenly father tonight lord as we stand in your divine presence we take fully lord this instruction from your prophet to do the opposite to sweeten our temper with prayer and to make up our minds to be salty to get right whatever it might be lord we realize that his advice is uncommon we realize the direction he's pointing it is against the grain and so lord as we accept these truths we ask that you would change us let me not remain as i am but change me o god lord i i am not despising what i am because i'm not what i used to be but lord i'm not what i want to be so change me and i pray lord that as you have begun a good work in us we know that you will finish it and as a church lord you've led a number of people many people lord in a very unique uncommon way to come and gather and be part of a church and lord i see the sacrifices that are made the losses that have been experienced the treachery that faces some and the intimidation the threats of being ostracized lord the feeling that they could immediately be put out of a circle lord but yet they're willing to take a risk to be an outlier to do what's uncommon or unprecedented lord not by joining a church but by following the leadership of the holy spirit and i pray that as you have led your people not just to a new church that's starting but lord as you have led them throughout their lives may they never despise it may they never belittle it may they never get far from it father may you continue to lead them and tonight lord we humble ourselves before you and say change my heart oh god continue lord to do what in me what i am unable to do lord i identify with the one that said lord i i need god to do it if he will do it but lord what can i do in my heart to change changes we pray commit the people to you specifically tonight desire and that there's something imparted something done something begun super something supernatural put an emotion tonight for us that we could see a change and a benefit by it lord may we all who have heard tonight leave and be the objector be the dissenter be the blocker contrary to the statistics contrary to the prevailing flow may we stand against the tide go the opposite way and lord because we're willing to do so may our son follow us may our daughter follow us may our loved ones follow us may they find that we've stood for truth we're following the light and may it inspire others to live for you to leave sin to walk in a plain path commit your people tonight to you as you have cared for them may they sink into that care and yield to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
