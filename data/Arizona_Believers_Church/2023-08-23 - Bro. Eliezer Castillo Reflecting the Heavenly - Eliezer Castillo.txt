TRANSCRIPT
========================================
First Corinthians 15 47-49 it says the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy as is as is the Heavenly such are they that are also heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy so so today we bear that image of the earthy I think we could all testify of that with our getting old um tempers rise sometimes we get frustrated we get tired it's just normal human life things we bear the image of the earthy but we shall also bear the image of the heavenly and my message today is reflecting the heavenly so let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord first of all we just want to give you the things like always Lord thank you for everything that you have done for us and allowing us to be here whether either one of us whoever had a rough day had a good day we just thank you that you brought us through Lord Jesus and now we're in your presence and we just ask that you take control of this service father Lord we ask that you take the preeminence and allow your word to flow out that it may strengthen the believer and and help those that need encouragement father we thank you Jesus we give it all to your hands the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated so it says that we have borne the image of the earthy but we will bear the image of the Heavenly and we notice in Genesis 1 26 how it says let us make man in our image we realize that a man has a dual something some two things are happening in a man he is he's bearing the image of the earthy which is our flesh which is the ground but when God created a man he created the spirit man first right and so he created that man and he said let him be in my image let him be in my likeness so when he says let him be in my image he's saying let him look like me let him reflect like me let him hit my son look like Dad right but then on Earth he Bears the image of the earthy which we can all like I said testify that's where our weakness comes from comes from that's where our our problems come from that's where all these things come from because we're tied to the Earth and God that's the way God made it God made it that way because God his purpose is to use man for Dominion he he's using man so that he could work on Earth through man because when God said let us create man in our image and in our likeness let us create them he said let them also have dominion he didn't say let me have dominion see brother Branham said that he was the god of the universe but man is the god of the Earth so so he gave this Spirit man the the opportunity the authority to rule over the Earth each and every man he gave him that opportunity that Authority but he gave it to the spirit man where the Earth is earthy the Earth is is full of calcium uh like brother Benham says potash atoms and all these things that's how the Earth is created so in order for man to have dominion on the earth he had to in Genesis 2 create the man out of the Earth so that the man could be in fellowship with God and he could be in contact with God yet he could go and he could touch the ground he could be that image or that representation of God to the ground to the Earth and that's the way God made men so that they could be that reflection of God to the Earth and we know that it's a very simple story we've heard it many times we know that Satan had his way Satan had his way and he he took the fellowship away from man and God to where what happened was the spirit and the flesh were separated so so the only way man what I realized in Genesis 1 26 is the only way man can have dominion is that he needs the spirit of God because he didn't tell the flesh man to have dominion he told the spirit have dominion that that he told that Spirit man you are going to rule you are going to have multiplication it's going to be you but whenever man sin whenever Satan uh put on put a breach between them he separated the man from the spirit so now you have this man without the spirit of God and and God that's the way he deals with man man is the vehicle of God man brother Branham said in the message Shalom he said you only have never seen me before I've never seen you you only see what's representing me and this this body right here but he says you've never seen me because we are a spirit the real you is not the the person struggling out there the real you is not the one that's having ups and downs and all of that the real you is settled in that Shekinah Glory no matter if the spirit sometimes is weak sometimes we have good days and we have bad days brother Branham says that we are a Triune being or he said that we are like the temple to where you have the outer courts the holies and then the holy of holies and the outer courts you're always going to have rain shine good days and bad days that's this this guy right here that's this flesh sometimes your emotions are going to go up and sometimes your emotions are going to go down that's your spirit that's that's the inner man but then there is the inside of the inside that will never fail it'll never fall because that that's where the real you is at that is the spirit man God says you're going to have the Dominion you're going to have that but but whenever they sinned God took away his Spirit from them to where they became brother Brown says man are animalistic now man it's a dog eat dog world now to where where people uh fight there's Wars and people kill and people hate and there's just so much going on and that's what happened but it's sadly that's normal to us now right we see that in the news we see that everywhere that's just how life is but that's not the way God intended it to be it's just sin separated and man began to be governed by the flesh and they tried to dominate or have dominion with the flesh and and then you see towers of Babel go up then you see these great kingdoms go up because they are being governed by their flesh or if you like to say by another spirit because the Bible says that we are temples of the Holy Ghost the Bible says that we are Earthen vessels holding treasure in our heart so so we are vessels not meant to be empty we're meant to be filled we're meant to to have a spirit guiding us every step of the way and and for for the bride that has reconnected to God reconnected with her husband she's governed by that spirit she's governed by the Holy Spirit wherever she goes that she's she's having dominion over the Earth again that was God's intended purpose and and that's we were just made that way our flesh was made that way um I I found this amazing study that um that of course we're all made up of atoms and and um and we have and in that atom the way it's formed is is there's a nucleus in in the middle right now I'm not gonna act like I know everything okay I'm just reading off of this if you ask me questions about this oh man I don't know well we're gonna have to Google it or something but atoms the way they're built is by a nucleus and around that nucleus there's electrons orbiting the nucleus okay and um the nucleus is about a hundred times smaller than the orbit of the electrons okay so if you imagine the nucleus as the head of a pin or or a pin head whatever you want to call it um the electrons orbit would be as far as a football field so so that's how much space from the nucleus to the uh the electron there is and this is just an atom okay but the the nucleus is so small and it's so far away from the electron that if you had a little Pinhead put it in between or inside of a football field it would be the space of a football field so it's got a lot of space okay the difference of atoms um the difference that makes atoms they're mostly empty space okay now atoms everything is made up of atoms okay you see this this is made up of atoms you see me I'm made up of atoms nobody can say this this isn't really real this isn't really here because you could see it I could touch it you could hear it but it's made up of these atoms that are mostly empty they're empty space okay and um it says that that in fact that there are about quintillion times more empty space than actual stuff in atoms that's how empty an atom is I started to realize that I realized how empty an atom is and how empty we are I say man we are meant to be dwelt in we are meant to be uh vessels of something and then I started to realize that a man is made up of of soul body and spirit you have two-thirds already that is Spirit so you're mostly made up of spirit your spirit and your soul and and then you have your body so so what governs or what what has no Dominion or what has the the preeminence is the spirit your body your body is just the fruits of what's inside right so so when when we feel when our body doesn't feel so good remember that's not you remember when things are are going on there's times of Life whatever is going on remember that's not you the real you has been bought with the price the real you has been tooken out of God that's the real you this body is going to fall it's going to get back up it's gonna hurt the spirit is going to be happy it's going to be sad but the real you is the peace of God inside of you and I realize that everything is empty space that makes me realize that there is a greater reality out there also that that that if somebody told me now this isn't really real or this isn't really there they would be more right than I would be just because of the empty space in the atoms and all all I'm feeling is electrical charges and and and that's what I'm feeling but in reality this is more empty than it's physical and that there is a greater reality outside of our dimension of thinking our dimension of the world our our everything our seat tastes feel smelling here so so of course the the devil he he separated man from God simple we know this story man brother Branham says they became Wanderers they became and what happened is is at like Abraham he began to find or try to look for a city whose Builder and maker was God he was trying to find back that image or that heaven he was trying to find back what he lost in the beginning and and and when the natural man the man that wasn't uh called by God when he was separated from his creator what he began to do was create idols because he was trying to find images to reflect a god they were trying to find something that would reflect something that they knew was there brother Branham says when the pilgrims came to to America they found that the Native Americans they were worshiped worshiping the sun god because they knew that that for some reason maybe that represented all of of creation the Creator so they would begin to worship the creation they would build up caps and they would do all these things so that they could say oh this is the image of God but in the reality man and women were meant to be the image of God we were supposed to be the likeness of God but they lost that and they tried to find God they tried to find an image of God a representation on Earth that reflected heaven but they couldn't find it anywhere so they started to build all these things and and even when God gave the forefathers when he gave the children of Israel the word it was still brother brown or the Bible says it was a shadow so it was the law but it was still a shadow or a shadow of of a reality out there it was a reflection of something else so even then they they had something that was quite not it and then they could not grasp it the way they wanted to grasp it because it was just a shadow but even though man and God were separated God was still there the Bible says that that God when he spoke or what brother Brandon said when he spoke the logos came out and when the logos came out that was the word that was the theophany or that was the spirit of God that was Christ and that that word cannot return to him void it did not return to him it began to work on the earth and it began to hide it himself in types Shadows it would hide itself in people you see Moses standing in the breach for his people what was he doing he was reflecting the image of Christ whenever God says I'm going to destroy all of Sodom and Gomorrah Abraham begin to intervene for the people what was it it was a shadow of an image it was a shadow of God and there was God hiding himself there was the logos there hiding himself creating images to show the people that there was a greater thing that was going to come brother Branham says the perfect image was Jesus Christ he was the god man and he finally came and it was God and morphe brother Branham says it was changed from the supernatural to the Natural or and he says he had or here in the Masterpiece he says the Perfect Image the God man God in morphe had changed from the supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that Supernatural could taste the feeling of death that's amazing that's amazing to where where the reflection whatever reflects Heaven whenever God uses man then you are his hands when he when you breathe air when you smell the flowers it's him when you cry when you cry for somebody it's him intervening for somebody and when Jesus came down he was that Perfect Image to where God says this image is going to die and Supernatural is going to be able to taste death that was God in his Tabernacle brother Branham says in things that are to be he says now now remember but these things are only temporal gifts in type we know that Moses in a building in the Tabernacle in the wilderness or preparing it he said he made all things in the order of what he saw in heaven see so the earthy things Earthly things only express the Eternal Things Are so everything on Earth brother random says that that everything on Earth reflects heaven the trees they reflect brother Brown says reflect the Tree of Life when you see the rock it was the rock smitten when you see everything on Earth reflects heavenly and he said if this Earth that we live in today being so great and we love it and we love to live and breathe air and see Flowers and Things if that if this is here is the expression of one that's dying is only expression of one that's eternal and when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that so so we see that that Moses when he created the Tabernacle it reflected everything that was in heaven so so what I love about that is anything they did any purpose that was made in the Tabernacle where where um lamb was slain where there had to be a sacrifice that sacrifice was representing something in heaven and it allowed them to be covered by that sacrifice because whatever was being done on that place was being done in heaven the Bible says whatever you loose on Earth is loosed in heaven whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven also Jesus prayed Let It Be or he says thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so everything that is on Earth and and everything that happened in that Tabernacle was happening in heaven it was a reflection but when Jesus died he was that Perfect Image yes brother Branham says that he was a diamond he was a diamond that was tooken out of the Earth he was it's the same thing that was Adam that second Adam had to do the same thing he he had the full spirit of God yet he had to come from the dirt and then brother Branham says that heaven and earth embraced them so there had to be an embracing once more and brother Branham typed him to a diamond that that diamond was tooken out of that ground and when that diamond that diamond began to be cut and what happens when a diamond is cut it begins to reflect pictures we begin to reflect colors and so every time that diamond was cut the colors started to come out brother Branham says that the seven spirits of God was in heaven he was holding the Seven Stars in his hand and he said those Seven Stars reflected the seven Messengers there were seven spirits there were seven Church ages and so there was they were there in the seven Church ages and whenever the great big diamond began to be cut it began to produce the bride there will begin to be a reflection the Eternal Light began to shoot right through him and as he cried out in in Calvary he began to shoot out those seven colors which was the Bride of Jesus Christ and that bride she is the reflection of Jesus Christ so every beating and every bruise that diamond took the bride was being formed and in Revelations 5 if you want to take it it's that's where it says that the throne preceding Lightnings and thunderings and voices there were seven lamps of burning fire Before the Throne which were the seven spirits of God brother Branham says in Revelations chapter 4 the part three he says where's the Holy Spirit here at the throne shining out in every in each age this church age is reflecting back this way the voices voices of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever see seven there was voices seven lamps on fire seven spirits which are the seven spirits of God the seven Church ages begin to reflect and and of course we see that on Earth that Jesus died but In Heaven There was that reflection going on in heaven that's why when John he saw the line of Judah what was it it was the lamb slain and that Lamb slain that Lamb slain was holding the spirits of God so everything that was in heaven now is reflecting to the bride and we're reflecting everything that is in heaven now um there's this there's a study now here's another um thing that is above my pay range but I'm gonna talk about it because I understand that everything that is true science has to reflect the word not something that tries to contradict the word true science true mathematics will always reflect God and I started to think about quantum physics and quantum physics is a type that helps us understand the very small building blocks of our world like atoms particles and even tinier than atoms and it introduces some strange ideas so there's an A A Thing Called quantum entanglement where they begin to to realize well I'm just gonna I'm gonna simplify it for me okay but it's he it says think of two gloves okay you put one in one box and the other one far away in another box and whatever you do to one glove instantly affects the other no matter how far apart they are the and and the particles can become linked in a similar mysterious way so these particles that are tinier than atoms that you that see there's there's a point in in in smallness if you'd like to say where you can cut in half and cut in half and cut in half but there's a point where you can't cut in half anymore and it becomes it's it's it loses its locality and so what happens is is there begins to be two particles or two things that begin to mimic one another and this great thought of that that the scientists have found now you see the movies trying to replicate it right you see all these Multiverse movies and all of that where one person's living a life here and then they're living another life over here and all they're they're doing is is they're mimicking what science has found that that that there is the scientists are saying maybe there's an alternate reality there's another use somewhere and what they think is there's another you in another reality doing something else living another life and maybe they're they're doing something that made it they made a different decision than you made in the past so they're living another life and you're over here living your life and the scientists are realizing hey this looks very plausible because of how these two particles they're acting in sync but what what I understand is that these particles they're acting in sync they're not living other lives and brother Branham he says this he says what what you are as I said in the beginning what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here see scientists are saying you're living another life but brother Branham says is whatever you are over there you're reflecting it here so we're reflecting something else we're a reflection and we're not we're not living separate lives but we're reflecting he says what you are what's your Celestial Celestial or terrestrial body is up yonder what your Celestial body is somewhere else is what you're reflecting back here he says the in in prisoner he says the physical has to die but if you are reflecting by your mortal life the light of heaven then you're reflecting eternal life God so so no matter what we're gonna have to die because we were made from the dust and the dust was cursed God cursed the snake God of course it wasn't a snake we're not going to go into that right now but God cursed the serpent God cursed Eve but we're like God didn't curse Adam he did the worst thing God cursed the ground and we are all made of the ground that was the greatest cursor when he said curse it be the ground all of Earth fell and we are part of that curse down we are part of those calciums we are getting old we're getting tired what we're living in a curse and our mortal body has to die but whenever you receive that eternal life in you you begin to he says reflect the Heavenly reflect or that you're reflecting eternal life you're reflecting God now okay he says then then he says something else that really caught my attention here he says when you die you can no more go to that lie because that's what you've reflected if you are of the Dark World you reflect that you can do um go no other way but to reflect Darkness see so we are in a reflection so we see that as sure as the Holy Spirit reflects light and life so does death and dark Death reflect Darkness so so no matter what the world those that reflect or that reject the word they're reflecting something else the the bride she's reflecting something else in heaven he says eternal life God you're reflecting another reality that's why that brother that we're living in a shadow if you want to call it we're living in a hologram why because atoms they're more empty than full so so and and the Bible says that the things that are seen were created from the things that were unseen brother Brown says the Unseen Supernatural he says so there's a greater reality out there greater so we see each other and we think this is all it this is life this is reality but there is a greater reality that created this hologram this this thing that we think is a physical life that we think oh man this is everything no that's why for the bride you start thinking of worldly Ambitions and it's good to to you know to love what you do and all these things but the bride realizes there's a greater reality out there and and not not that we're just supposed to leave but we're supposed to reflect it in this this life that we think is is uh is so real we're supposed to reflect the real reality because he says have dominion multiply and and when Jesus died that's what he did he says unless the corn of wheat fall or uh in the ground it has to fall so that it can multiply and that's all we're doing we're multipliers that that's what brother Branham says that that we are a womb and when the spirit of God comes then we multiply that's that's all a human being is is a multiplier so we're reflecting something greater and and those that are in the world in another place they're reflecting something else brother Branham talked about one time he was in JCPenney and he started walking and he sees an image that scared him he saw two Hispanic women with with uh makeup all over that wasn't the scary part where she says sometimes it you know it would scare him but that wasn't the scary part the scary part is it brought him back to when he was a child and whenever he went to hell he saw those same women now you're talking about years and years and years after he sees those same women in the JCPenney mall but when he was a kid he sees them and he sees those great green things under their eyes he said that wasn't makeup he says those were cankers and sores but now in their life they put it on because they they want to look pretty not knowing they're reflecting what he saw over there in the Dark World right so so there's a reflection going on here and our life is just bearing the fruits bearing the fruits of what's out there that's why I praise God because Jesus Christ died for specific people he died for the whole world but there was only one person that was going to be able to bear that image of Jesus Christ and that was the Bride of Jesus Christ and the amazing thing is that call is for anybody but there's just a few that are going to answer that call brother Brown says he in in who is this Melchizedek he says you bypass the theophany and became flesh man so we bypass that Heavenly bearing that heavenly to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle the shadow this reflection be dissolved we have already we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies but look see this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you and it throws this body subjection to God so when you receive the Holy Ghost what happens maybe we begin we were burying the the fruit or the the image of the earthy we were going out to the world we were doing all these things but whenever you receive the spirit of God it throws this body into subjection see our bodies are Vehicles is God's license on Earth the way God moves is through you the way God if he needs to touch somebody it's through you one of the greatest things that brother Branham said I think it was a spoken word is in the Original Seed he said that that Paul he saw the pillar of Fire now imagine that we're privileged to have a picture of it now now for me I started to think how amazing that is because we see a picture and that's amazing but once you start getting into really that picture that picture is From Another Dimension that picture is is from a greater reality and he he was able to show himself for a second but then here see Paul sees that Pillar of Fire and that pillar he said who are you Lord and of course he said I'm Jesus I'm the one that you've been persecuting now this is Jesus Christ himself imagine that face to face with Paul I say praise God Paul man that man was something else where God himself in the pillar of fire would say hey I got a message for you man I gotta talk to you yeah I died I rose up again but I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna talk to you in the form that I want to talk to you in there was a reason why he he talked to him that way because Paul knew the pillar of Fire Paul recognized it he knew that was the angel of the Covenant he knew that was God leading the children out of Egypt so when he saw him automatically the scriptures begin to come and that revelation hit and he said Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus the one who you persecute now Jesus could have gave him everything that he needed right there because it was Jesus he is the source of life he is everything and Paul he needed some stuff first he needed to be healed he needed to be prayed for he needed the Holy Ghost he needed a lot of things he needed a conversion in his life because he he wanted to destroy the Christians he could have got that from the source itself but God uses bodies God uses you and I so God could have said here this is everything you need and also here you're you're healed no he said go to a man named ananias go to that man and he will lay his hands on you and you'll receive everything that you need brother Branham also recounts the story of of the eunuch and Philip how brother Branham says that Philip had been with the with all the doctors the DDS and the pH whatever he's been with all of them that means that he was given theology he was given all the the knowledge that he needed yet he lacked the revelation he needed something else and and the Bible says brother Branham says in the spoken word he says that an angel led him to go there brother said he couldn't use that angel though because the the The Germ has to come from the body that eternal life has to come through you and I so he could have used an angel could have spoke to him but he needed a reflection on Earth uh to have dominion once more to be Kings and Priests over the Earth so then he used this man and there even though he already talked to people those people didn't have the germ he already talked to the the DDS and whatever brother Branham said all these these these men but they didn't have that germ of life to give to the eunuch until Philip came so we are that reflection you have that Earnest of your Resurrection right now you you have an Earnest you have a reflection of what you already are in heaven brother Branham says that that that that when this body be dissolved we already have one waiting he says you have the earnest of your Resurrection you have an Earnest of your theophany brothers that means there's another use somewhere else think about it it's another you and that you is perfect that you is in the Throne of God right now and whenever we're stoop shouldered and we're kicking ourselves where that you is perfect in the image of God that that's why I love that the Bible says there is no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus there is you cannot impute sin to them no more see there's a difference between a great sin or this sin the sin and sins brother we we fall we sin we do something wrong and man we just know how to beat ourselves up and send ourselves right back to hell we know how to do that no nobody else has to do that we'll send ourselves right back into condemnation oh man I'm unworthy oh man I I'm nothing but God isn't looking at your flesh brother Brown says you're you're not you've never seen me in your life I remember whenever Samuel was supposed to uh find another king Samuel said okay let's look for another big guy let's look for another great warrior let's what was he doing he was looking at the flesh man he was looking at the body and God says hey just give you a little secret I look at the heart I look at what's inside a person and that's what God is looking at today and and so whenever we fall whenever we do all those things remember God isn't looking at the image bearing the Earth he's looking at the heavenly he's looking at the perfection amen so brother Branham he says so the earthy only expresses what the Eternal Things Are he says and if this Earth that we live in today be so great okay I already read this let's see amen this this study man it made me so happy you know because sometimes you you you see yourself in the mirror and you see that reflection you say oh my goodness but then you realize that God he he paid that price before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and you were there praising the Lord God says who where were you job why were they worshiping why were they praising the Lord the lamb was slain that that image or the that bearing that image of heavenly were was already there okay so so we are just living a shadow of life now now I I don't have much left but we're just living that shadow and the bride she is living the shadow of Christ and brother Branham he said that whenever Christ died the spirit went down and preached to the souls that were in prison and that body stayed there on the Earth but he said whenever that the spirit began to go up the body began to rise to meet it he says he says this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he preaches a lot about the head coming back to the body and he said that the body was there and and the spirit was the type or was the head he said and the spirit was coming back to the body and he said that was a type of the seven Church ages the bride in the seven churches coming back to the Head and that in every Church Age We they were just looking at a far shadow the body would begin to rise up from the feet and and there was a far Shadow and whenever you see a shadow from afar you'll start seeing almost three shadows it's blurry you don't know what it is and that's what was going on the word wasn't revealed fully but as as the ages went on the word unfolded a little bit more and you saw a little bit of the image and then the word was unfolded a little bit more and you saw more of that image the word was completely unfolded to our day that we're not living in a partial realization anymore brother Brown says we're not living in a time where where it's a reformer age or all these things we're living in the full revelation of God brother Branham he says he says you take a shade farther away from the shade the least reflection you get from the shade after a while the shade gets closer and closer till the tree and the shade become the same thing now the spirit of God has worked under justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here today in the last day performing and doing the very same thing that that um that it did when Christ when that was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one it's not becoming one we're not we're not waiting for something else it has become one with this word this word has everything to change sickness to health this word has everything to change from Death To Life this word has re is restoring us back to Eden back to the reflection of God that's what this word is he says in the lady you'll see a church age he says partial realization we have been made perfect realization complete realization Hallelujah we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but to soon it will be right in the glory and His glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him Jesus our savior Divine isn't that wonderful we are complete in him that is true we would not lie he would not lie to us about this about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms so in this that you see one day is going to be changed one day we're going to be changed and we will put on immortality we will be swallowed up in life then we will realize realization if you'd like to stand with me Philip asked Jesus one time he said Lord show us the father show us the father and it'll satisfy us amen Jesus had to rebuke him he said haven't I been with you so long imagine that they're trying to look for this great God this this great omnipotence and they see this little stupid shouldered man and he says haven't I been with you for so long that you haven't realized that I've been with you many people say where is God many people say God has forsaken this place you guys can say haven't I been here haven't I been here for so long what are you doing your reflection reflecting the image of God and whenever God needs to touch somebody when God needs to bless your family you are that reflection God bless you brother it's been contacted did you touch it God bless you brother he he's part of God he's that reflection God bless you brother the supernatural has contacted the natural every time we talk to one another every time we Fellowship every time you go and you pray for somebody what is it God intervening through his people you are that reflection of God if the brother would like to come up let us bow our heads [Music] Heavenly Father Lord I just asked father that you give us that Revelation father I know it's there but whenever we're going through our hardest times Lord that's when that Revelation needs to sink in father whenever maybe when somebody doesn't feel like they're Worthy that you may show them Lord that that you are with them Father that you are reflecting your life through them and that no matter how battered and how scarred our lives and bodies and spirit is we're reflecting something that is perfect that can never fall that can never fall out of Grace that can never sin their way away from God Lord I ask that you just be with each and every person and we want to give you the glory Lord the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you [Music]
