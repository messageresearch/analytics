TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to be on the subject of the house of the Lord I don't know just exactly how much time we may spend on this as I was studying last week and preparing I just felt like well maybe maybe it's just a couple and uh we won't get enough distance out of this nice graphic that I put together but if we're just wanting to look at the subject of the house of the Lord I find myself uh looking at a lot of different types and shadows a lot of things that we've already ministered from here a lot of things that we already know from being well taught and instead of just maybe digging in deep on these different things uh and just set laying a foundation of a lot of services on the house of the Lord I kind of want to just look at the house of the Lord and then look at how we would look at it today and what it means to us today and so that it's more applicable and re relevant to us I find as I'm looking at these things that there's a kind of a this is a continuation of the Kingdom series uh some of those same principles and Concepts we'll be revisiting them and I find that the the word has been preached so anything that you preach you're revisiting it and I don't want to have too much of a complex where I feel that I'm just repeating myself uh but I do think there's a lot of things that we repeat for the sake of emphasis uh to highlight something to underline it and say this is something that was ministered quite frequently in the message of the hour this is a constant theme we see in the scripture and so it's something that we would even have a duty to emphasize ourselves so there's a lot of things in this that you'll find familiar but I'm trusting that it really speaks to you in a personal way and my title today is the place to seek him I I think originally I had it as a place to seek him and then I realized oh well I don't want to imply that there's just a bunch of ways you can find him but there's a place that you can find him and it's the place to seek him and that's what we want to focus on today now as you look at Psalms chapter 27:4 and we focused on this Wednesday night and we preached on one thing desired he says one thing that I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple so this is that phrase the house of the Lord now he's already made references to it in the way what we've read about already using different words and terminologies for it but when we use the house of the Lord It's referring to this place that David is thinking about and for David this was a very precise and specific place it wasn't when he said it everyone didn't kind of conjure up in their idea oh I have my house you have your house and there's these many different houses of the Lord when David said the house of the Lord he's thinking of a very specific place and he calls it his Temple so it's the Lord's Temple it's the palace where God is King it's a sanctuary a place that's dedicated it's a holy place in Psalms 268 it says Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house the dwelling what it is what it represents and the the place where thine honor dwelleth so David talks about his Temple the house of the Lord and his Tabernacle it's the place where the shakina glory rests you're not going to find the shakina glory just anywhere is what he he knew he's not going to be manifesting himself just anywhere but it was a place where God it pleased God to make himself known and we could find a lot of things in the scripture and the message of the hour to bring that out but if we look in first Kings chapter 8 we'll find that what happened in the Tabernacle the one in of the Wilderness the one that traveled the one that was the sole place where they would sacrifice and meet God that when a temple was built and Solomon is dedicating this Temple and all the priests are performing their service it says in First Kings 8: 10 and 11 and it came to pass when the priest were come out of the Holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord this is what makes this place so significant is you weren't finding this anywhere else it was within this structure within this Arrangement this Arrangement that God had detailed and God had expressed to them that this is where the glory of the Lord fills the it fills up the room and so this is called the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord fills it up you can't just put up a box and call it the house of the Lord if God doesn't come visit it if God's not identified with it so the glory of the Lord filled it and that's how it became to be known the house of the Lord God Vindicated it his presence was there and David's attitude towards this is so great that he says in verse 5 of Psalm 27 for in the time of trouble now I trust that God will give me the grace to minister all the things that I have in front of me today uh that we've put together for this service and this idea of being in trouble being in need comes out quite a bit in some of the things we're going to be reading for in the time of trouble he shall hide me now this is a a remark able note here he says to hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock David is being very poetic very descriptive in the time of trouble he's going to hide me in his Pavilion and then he says it's in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall set me up upon a rock all these terminologies are describing the house of the Lord he shall hide me in his Pavilion it's also translated to Tabernacle in other places it speaks of a den or a booth a covert a place of protection he shall hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle that word is translated to tent because it refers to a dwelling a home or a habitation this these are the things that the language that's being used this Den this booth this Co covering this dwelling this habitation and he calls it a secret because he going to be hid that's a covering a shelter a hiding place protection it means to be concealed or hidden uh to hide carefully so David knows that in the house of the Lord there's protection he knows in the house of the Lord there's covering and we we say he says in the secret of his Tabernacle it's it wouldn't necessarily imply that nobody knows where the Tabernacle is or knows what the Tabernacle does and wouldn't know that he's in it but there's something about it where he's hid he's safe there's a protection to it and it calls it here as we read that I want to inquire to seek the Lord in verse four he tells us that it's going to be I want to behold the beauty of the Lord so the temple the house of the Lord is a place of God's Beauty his kindness his pleasantness it's a place of his favor it speaks of it means to be beautiful to be sweet to be lovely that's what the house of the Lord is it's lovely it's sweet it's beautiful and he says that that I may inquire in his Temple so it's a place of inquiry it's a place to inquire a place to seek it means to consider reflect or as we like to say here Ponder and this is that place that's describing this is the way to describe the house of the Lord it's a it's a pavilion it's a it's a tabernacle it's a place of God's Beauty it's a place to reflect it's a place to consider it's the place to seek him to inquire in his Temple so when you're there in this place it's a place to seek him to ponder yourself to reflect on things to think about the future and there's a lot of other ways that we could describe this but these are defining characteristics of the house of the Lord and this is the place that David sought above all else it was the one thing desired for him and all the things that go with it it was the habitation he says that he loved it was a place of God's presence it's the place of God's protection as David is saying it's a place of God's provision because you inquired to receive so these are the things that describe the house of the Lord now I had still wrestling even up to the moment that we left to come to church today on just where to stop and I'm not thinking about stopping right here unless I get a lot of encouragement to do so uh a lot of bribes or something all oh man maybe we should open up the floor we get just start auctioning off the stop time uh set up a gofund me someone real quick I'm just not sure which direction to go and I'd already took out just a bunch of notes here already so I'm going to be skipping brother John a little bit uh to 2 Chronicles but this house that David desired I want to approach it from this angle for just a little bit it was not in heaven it's located in Jerusalem and know for some of you you're probably thinking well I don't know that that needed to be stated but I think it's good to recognize David's attitude towards something and how that its location was in Jerusalem one thing have I desired of the Lord and David's attitude in the midst of trials in the midst of difficulties he says I want to be there now this is I think this is a good point because we kind of have this and I want to be very careful kind of walking this tight tight rope and this is how I feel like I can call back back to the series on the kingdom we know we want to get out of this world but we're coming back to this world and we know that we want to leave uh uh uh because we want to go meet the Lord in the air but that's because it's according to a promise and a prophecy that's what's next and yet David here with the next promise he had of a messiah coming is not saying oh my enemies are about me my Kingdom's in danger I just want to go home I just want to die I've had enough that wasn't David's attitude I David's attitude is I I this is the place that I desire this is the place that I long to be it says in 2 Chronicles chapter 3 verse one I want to nail this down very clearly that David is not referring to a place in heaven that he wants to be we can't say well David wanted to be at that temple in heaven he wanted to be in that Tabernacle in heaven he's talking about the temple in Jerusalem says then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah where the Lord appeared unto David his father in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of Orin the jebusite the word Mariah means chosen by Jehovah there's a very special place it's the place where that God led Abraham to or showed Abraham when he offered up Isaac in Genesis 22 this was a special Mountain this has special significance to the people of Israel special significance to these Jews and this house that David desired the house of the Lord was built at Jerusalem in Mount this very specific location so when David says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life he's talking about on Mount Mariah there was an address there was a zip code you could use directions to get there it was a it was a physical structure but it's in a very special place in Genesis 22:14 this Mount Mariah Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall shall be seen in other words he sees it's Jehovah Gyra we say my provider but it it's it means Jehovah sees and in other words God knows your need God sees exactly what you're going through and he will provide according to that need and as d as Abraham is saying as he's provided for me so will he provide for all those who trust in him in other words I'm going to name this place Jehovah Gyra mount in Mount Mariah this is Jehovah Gyra God sees that God will see the Lord will appear in all ages at all times in all difficulties in all circumstances in your distress and in your need no don't despair God sees and he will respond and that's what Mount Mariah signified and when they build the temple it is said that if my people when they're in trouble anywhere in the world if they'll look to this place here they'll know and they offer up their supplication and turn their hearts I will see and I will hear and I will answer in Jewish Traditions they believe that this Temple Mount is the focal point of creation they even believe that there's a stone upon which Isaac was offered by Abraham that's called the foundation stone is the very beginning of the creation of the world it's there that Adam came into be and there where Abraham Isaac and Jacob served God there in this spot is where the first temple was built where the second temple was built the ark of the covenant they say is even laid upon that foundation stone and they look at this area this place this singular Place Temple Mount is what it's summarized as there's so many other scriptures in the Bible that describe it but Jerusalem was chosen by God as the dwelling place of his shikina glory one place in all the world it would be right there it says in Malachi excuse me in Micah 4: 1-5 he says but in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord so this is Mount Mariah shall be establish estblished in the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall flow unto it what incredible language remarkable to think about it in light of the fact that there is going to be a new heavens and new earth and a New Jerusalem and here it's going to describe symbolically even of a millennium and many nations shall come and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the god of Jacob and he will teach us his ways and we will walk in his paths this is what the house of the Lord represented the place where God reigned a place of teaching a place of instruction to walk correctly for the law shall go forth of Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem from where the house of the Lord and he shall judge from where from the house of the Lord among many people and rebuke strong Nations a far off and they shall beat their swords into plow shares and their Spears into pruning hooks Nations shall not lift up a sword against Nation neither shall they learn War anymore but they shall set every man under his Vine under his fig tree and None Shall make them afraid for the mouth of the lord of the host hath spoken it for all people will walk everyone in the name of his God and we will walk in the name of the Lord Our God forever and ever now notice how the prophet is writing about a time of perfect peace and Tranquility everyone getting along in the house of the god of Jacob being established in the mountain of the house of the Lord being established in the top of the mountains they did not seek a place called in heaven something I want I I know I emphasize this quite a bit in this the kingdom series but it just seems to be a refrain that I want to keep repeating it wasn't this longing to be out of this Earth and into heaven a lot of that's built around um the U even Catholicism as we mentioned before that there's this dichotomy Between Heaven and Hell and all we're doing here is making our decision to go to heaven if you don't light enough candles and pay enough money you're going to end spend the rest of your life in Hell or Purgatory but there's a way to get out of that so that you could be in heaven and this Earth kind of is an afterthought but if we look at it from the standpoint of the Old Testament they're not asking to go to heaven they're not asking to go to an invisible habitation of God beyond what they could see he's actually saying this house of the Lord that I love it is the habitation of your house it is where you dwell I I love the habitation of thy house and the place where thy honor dwelleth that's where I want to be not in heaven I want to be where you are and I don't want to just leave this earth and I just want to die so I can go be with my Lord to the Jews there was a different promise that the Lord himself would come and be resident among men on Earth David sought Heaven on Earth David as a as a Jew knew that there was a place that God could be seen a place that God was present now instead of taking more time to amplify the house of the Lord and what it would mean to a Jew I could just fast forward a little bit here and ask the question where where is the house of the Lord today and we may say instinctively well this is the house of the Lord and we could be accurate in one sense except that you would be wrong to think that this was the only house of the Lord so was a way that we could say the house of the Lord that would reply imply some characteristics or some attributes that could be shared of other places but I I'm asking the question and I don't I I've even intentionally just left a lot of things out to where I'm not going to answer it overtly but where is it we can find him now where is it do we go when we need his help Amen in Isaiah chapter 66 ver1 it says thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol we think that's that's right he's basically saying what who can contain the fullness of my beauty and my glory that heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol there's a lot of imagery established in that goes where where is the house where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest where is it I'm going to dwell where is it I'm going to be made known where is the house of the Lord where God is King Where is My Sanctuary where is the place that the shikina glory rests a place of God's Beauty his kindness his pleasantness his loveliness a place where we can be taught his ways according to Micah a place to be judged but yet a place of Peace a place to chire which means a place where I can seek the face of the Lord a place where I can seek counsel when I have questions a place where I can seek protection when I'm in trouble I guess it would maybe beg the question can this be found on Earth today if there was a physical Temple Physical place of worship that you could run into and as long as you're there you couldn't be taxed that place would be packed right there's a place you could run where you wouldn't get covid right that place would be packed you wouldn't have to wear a mask think of that no no uh no distancing I think it's funny is all the stickers are still up right all the markings you know maintain uh uh 3ot distance from here and and everywhere they got all these things up wear mask and even in some places where nobody will be served unless they're wearing a mask and you're tempted just to go in there and only a mask right just to see how serious they are about it but that nobody's doing it anymore they they've moved on from it but could you imagine when it was like that a place where you knew you were absolutely safe a city of ref refuges we could say perhaps can this be found on Earth today do you have a place like that is there a place that we can go to inquire when we have questions and we need answers and I know you're all thinking that's right Bing that's what we do we just Bing it and we use Bing Ai and we ask the questions and we get the answers we need but I'm actually challenged that challenging that instinct because a lot of times that when we have questions we're we're seeking counsel and we're looking for help and we're looking for protection and we're looking looking for contingencies and so I'm asking you where is the place of your rest amen now this is going to escalate quickly in 2 Kings chapter 1 veres 1 to3 it says then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab and haaiah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick and he sent Messengers and said unto them go inquire of belzebub the god of ekron whether I shall recover of this disease now think of this just how terrible this is that this king is now wanting to go inquire Beelzebub the god of ekron whether or not he's going to recover of his disease he the the scripture implies as we'll continue to read that he had heard enough and seen enough to know that there was a place that you could go right that there was there was a a go in Israel who knew the very things that were happening behind closed doors there was a God who looked out after a God who was Vindicated he says go inquire go seek find out whether or not I'm going to recover from this disease but the angel the Lord said to Elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them is it not because there's not a God in Israel that you go to inquire of elub the god of ekron now if you could think of that for a little bit that God thought enough of this situation to where he wanted to rebuke his instinct to go seek an answer from somewhere else other than the Lord amen that when he was sick and he wasn't sure how long he would live and wasn't sure of his prognosis his Instinct wasn't just to trust the Lord or go to a source where he knew someone was speaking and I know in those days there was maybe just a lot of reading of the tea leaves and a lot of black magic and witchery and those different things that still exist today trust me hold this and there's a lot of things that uh is used uh that we would call today quackery and maybe then without the the benefits of research and Google and things or oh well he was just trying to get the best information he could but something in this implies that he knew better and the question is is it not because there's not a God in Israel that you would go inquiring I'm just piggybacking off of those terms that David says one thing have I desired that I may inquire in his Temple that when I'm in trouble I'll go there when I'm in need I'll go there when I don't have answers to my questions I'll go there my first instinct will I'll be there and there I'll seek and there I'll consider and there I'll pray and it's there within that context and within that place I know that whatever answers I get can be the right ones and it was the king's selfishness and stubbornness that kept him from seeking the Lord he had a hard heart he was rebellious he was stubborn and and as I was reading in all the places I could find where brother bam addressed this and I just started coming up with quite a list of statements to use and was able to pair it down quite a bit brother BR talks about his selfishness his stubbornness and even the commentators about it talk about his stubborn will and and and to imply that shows that maybe there was some check in his conscience that he thought I should probably go to Elijah they said no I won't do it I I'm not going to do it I'm going to inquire of the god of ekron and brother B said oh there was a god there was a prophet but it was the king's own stubbornness he didn't want to line up with God and His Prophet let's just kind of rake this into ourselves today let's just think of how this can be applicable and that was the reason that the King was seeking the easiest way out of these things amen I know that there's a there's a stain that's put on Christianity where it said that faith is just a weakness and it's a weakness of the mind and to trust in God is just lazy but really to go externally for your help is an easier way than to trust in the Lord yes sir he says he was wanting the easy way out of these things he says that's the reason of it he says it was his own stubbornness he didn't want to line up with the word of God he wanted the easy way out now hopefully this can challenge a little bit we could have just called these last several Services challenges challenges part 1 2 3 4 5 wherever we're at now in these challenging things but to ask ourselves do I seek the easy way out or am I willing to line up with the word of God Amen the answer the answer we know and I believe that I'm speaking to people that know the ANW is in the word of God but we kind of look at that route and we think oh my to get there that's tough and we're stubborn about it and we try to find a shortcut through a god of ekron says in another place and that's what's the matter with Nations today in the world it's not because we haven't got a God but science is trying to rule him out of the picture so outstanding science is trying to rule him out of the picture and the people are too stubborn to stand up on the principles of God's word what he says here is so relevant today it I would not be surprised at all if he was looking at 2024 when he said it come on that science is getting it's so pushed and it leads with such a Forefront and it leads with a lot of facts that are accurate and a lot of things that are correct and a lot of dots are being connected but they're trying to use that to paint a picture that keeps God out and we need to be uh we need to be stubborn in this sense that we're not willing to move from what the word of God says regardless of what science says said now I'm not disputing your facts but you you can't arrange those facts to rule God out of the picture we got to keep working with the facts until we see him we we've got to keep working with what you have that's great I'm not disagreeing but how is it your truth can finally click to see the truth which is Christ but we got to recognize the atmosphere and the environment that we're living in today that science and even our own selfishness is trying to rule God out of the picture and we get too stubborn to stand on the principles of the word of God maybe we get a little bit too worried about peer pressure social clout and different things we're not willing to stand on the word of the god word of God and as this King as he defaulted to is what brother B called the easiest path why do we seek Comfort anywhere else outside of Christ on I know that that would I mean I guess it's my mind that the way that it works I know immediately what uh my maybe my objection would be if I was just going to have a counterargument and so even in response anticipating uh the rebuttal that seeking to seek Christ to be in the will of Christ to to go to Christ is not to do nothing else right but it's that whatever you do is with his under his leadership everything you do is with confidence in God that he's the one that's leading if God heals by medicine you can't say well I mean I don't know if God's A Healer but I know he heals by medicine so I'm just going to run off to the doctor but it's knowing that God's my healer that my Help Cometh From The Lord and I'm going to get help from somebody else I'm going to get help through this situation I'm going to get help through medicine through rest and these things it's recognizing that at the end of the day your faith and confidence isn't in the bottle but in the God who knows your need the God who sees and so why do we seek Beauty in places where Christ is not why do we seek peace and favor anywhere else that Christ is does not have preeminence Amen brother bman multiple sermons where he's preaching the sermon why and he's taking it from Jeremiah chapter 8 and also uh from this uh from this place here is there not a God in Israel he says why do we he says I wonder and I wonder why this is in the sermon why why don't they come they're looking for pleasure they're looking for peace they're subst substituting they're looking for pleasure they're looking for peace and he says they're substituting I would argue that what brother Brown is saying is that the pleasure and peace that people are looking for can be found in him and their substitute he says the devil substituting such Rowdy things as that to take the place of a real good Spirit-filled experience where the joy of the Lord could come upon them and give them peace and rest can you testify that that's true I I I know what it's like to be in the world seeking something that will plate anxiety and fear I know what it's like to try to find a good time out there in the world but there's nothing out there you may have fun for a moment but there's nothing out there that satisfies like Christ when you know him and the Forgiveness of sins and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that that is real Joy that's the peace and the rest that mankind craves he says they love the pleasure of the world more than they love the kingdom of God their life proves it it's exactly what they live shows it amen the things we say the things we think about the things we talk about the things we do the things we pursue talk about what we desire or what we expect to get from what we think we desire what we pursue tells us what we think what our desires are supposed to achieve brother R says in one place it's the people's own stubborn way they don't want to bow down good why is it we won't humble ourselves to God's provided way brother B uses this quite a bit in Jeremiah chapter 8: 18-22 he uses this a lot in in these sermons why in these different places that I was studying but the prophet is chastising Israel for their stubbornness and so you can see that when brother talks about the stubbornness it it comes from how God was rebuking them and God's rebuke is prophesying Calamity and judgment and death to the kingdom and it's very for boing and very uh judge the judgments are coming it's a damnation to Israel and so Jeremiah the prophet the weeping prophet the lamenting Prophet it says in verse 18 when I would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in me this is after these judgments have come and these words of what's going to happen and the death HH uh and people being Scattered Graves being opened up and Bones being scattered not resurrected but things such an affront to Israel says behold the voice of the Cry of the daughter of my people people because of them that dwell in a far country because now they're being taken out of their homes they strangers in forward lands voice of the bridegroom the voice of the Bride is no longer heard just weeping is found and he says and they've been taken into a far country is not the Lord in Zion what a question isn't this where he said he would be is not her King in her why is it that this is happening isn't isn't God supposed to be here isn't he supposed to be available hasn't he made me a promise isn't his word true why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with their strange vanities the Harvest has passed the summer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black astonishment have taken hold on me is there no Bal and Gilead is there no physician there and it's it's an expression of well there should be cuz is not the Lord in Zion is not her King in her cuz then he says that he it anticipates this rhetorical question suggests that the answer would be like well yes but he says why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered if he's here if he's available if the word is here if the king is in her if the Lord is in Zion then why is the health of the daughter of my people not recovered why is the question that brother brandham is asking I've asked the question why would we seek anything else why would we seek a of erron why why would we be stubborn in our own ways and stick to our own ways when we see that things aren't working out and not do the things that we know that we ought to do and it's in Jeremiah chapter 7 that you find the answer to Jeremiah's question here in Jeremiah 8 is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there brother Brandon would say or we could read from these it's not that there wasn't a god oh there was a god there was a prophet here we could say that oh there there's the Lord that's his favor in Zion this is the the place that God's chosen but this is what is said in the chapter preceding Jeremiah 7: 1-1 I I might skip a little bit here and touch on some things but we'll read through verse 11 the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying stand in the gate of the Lord's House and Proclaim there this word and say hear the word of the Lord all ye of Judah that enter in at these gates To Worship the Lord thus sayith the Lord of host the god of Israel amend your ways and your doings and I will cause you to dwell in this place trust not in line words saying the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord are these now the repetition is for a reason there a lot of things you could look at to uh describe why there was repetition perhaps the repetition is because the Temple of the lord of the outer courts the Temple of the Lord to the inner Court the Temple of the Lord to the holy of holies and in that three p repetition it embodies the house of God the house of the Lord it could be that it was those three times a year that there to appear before the Lord in Jerusalem at Passover Pentecost and Feast of Tabernacles the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord there's a way that this repetition is done to call to mind certain aspects of this place that we come this three-fold place of porch inner Court holy of holies this place that we come for Passover Pentecost Feast of booze this place that we come there's where our justification lies that's good it's well the temple of the Lord because he says trust not in lying words that say well the temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord because Israel was being hypocritical in their worship they didn't think that God would destroy or allowed to be destroyed the temple right they thought oh well God identified himself here God this is the place that God dwells God will always protect it and they forgot his word that said letest you do these things you have to honor the word of God you have to obey the word of God so God didn't say well no matter what you do no matter what you say the temple is going to be preserved in Micah 3:1 it says the heads thereof judge for reward now notice this condemnation of the house of the Lord says the heads there have judged for reward and the priests there have Teach For Hire and the prophets there have Divine for money it ought not to be that way this was a place where you there would be judging there'd be teaching there would be knowledge things that would come forth but not for reward or for higher for money and it says yet will they lean upon the Lord and say is not the Lord among us none evil can come Among Us now I know the application of this uh you can be very strict in your application but I hope that you can be a little bit more broad or specific for your case however the Lord May deal with you but there was a certain idea that they believed that their ceremony and their tradition was more important than obedience that traditionally this is where this is the house of the Lord and this is where the shikina glory comes down and this is all the things that God said about it and so they could do whatever they want judge for reward Teach For Hire Divine for money and then just say was not the Lord among us is he not doing what he said he would do do we not have signs uh do we not have this do we not have that do not the priest go in and offer is this kind of Glory not there wow but because they were no longer keeping in harmony with the word of God and doing these things this is what leads Jeremiah to say is there no bombing Gilead there's no physician there's this this not the house of the Lord is God not in Zion and the question going to be like yes but yes well then why isn't the the health of my daughter recovered brother brandham says this in the sermon why he said he's and in some of these larger statements he's identifying kind of this worldliness and this looseness this lack of uh circumspect us a lack of Holiness in people's lives and forward progress maybe a lot of ways we could describe it but then he says because there's no joy in the house the Lord what makes a person want to drink and run around and act like that is it because we don't have any god wow is it because there's no joy in the house of the Lord anymore and here brother Bram is specifically talking about church and I I I want to use this just so we can challenge ourselves about uh the atmosphere that we're creating the attitude that we have towards this Gathering is it because the Holy Spirit isn't ready to bless all of us is there anything wrong with it and I would say the Holy Spirit wants to bless us there's nothing wrong with coming to church there was certainly nothing wrong with judging and teaching and divining but when it's done for reward and done for hire and done for money when it's not done for the right objective and the right way and to have this attitude was the Lord not among us even maybe a Cavalier attitude towards church or Cavalier attitude towards certain things it's like well God's with me what does all these other things matter on he says but because that we do it that's the reason we're cursed he's doing these other things that's the reason God putting this thing upon the church this cold and dampness that's quite a statement a cold and dampness what a day to read it and the reason why it's happening he says we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure we find it too easy to make time for other things instead of God we find it too easy to recreate and go out and do things for pleasure and do things to enjoy and the one thing desired is actually being told with in our own actions that no you can say you desire him but really you're being selfish really you only desire to satisfy your own desires your own flesh your own popularity your own power cuz he's saying we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure now you might say I got to go to church to be entertained or go to church for pleasure I'm I'm not trying to answer the question where's the house of the Lord but I do believe he is in some place there is a place you can find him and are we going there because we desire it or do we go to other places the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord amen there was a time when believing families listened to the message of the hour as a means of evening entertainment not because it was frivolous and it was some sort of a a jolly good time but it was something they look forward to and something they valued he says the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord amen the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people he's concerned about your joy he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied give him praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God he wants you to do that but it's not going to be your inheritance if you're going you're looking for pleasure in places you shouldn't be looking for pleasure because you can do exactly what they were doing here if they were challenged it wasn't that you found them at home not doing anything they right there in the house of the Lord they're right there coming to the door to hear Jeremiah prophesy against them they're there in the house but it's not what they're doing in the house that's keeping their services where they are it's what they're doing outside of that place of worship that was causing the cold and dampness to come upon the house of the Lord because this is how Jeremiah picks it up Jeremiah chapter 7 verse 5 he says for if ye thoroughly fruy amend your ways and your doings if you thly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor that means you're going to get it right if you oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the Widow and shed Not Innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt then will I cause you to dwell in this place in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever now that's cause us to recognize there's a certain character of the people that's not matching the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord even it says is not God Among Us no evil can come upon us because all of it has been put into the Vindication of the Prophet all of it's put into the sanctity of the church all of it's been put into these the semantics and the arrangement and all the logistics and there's this idea oh well it doesn't matter what I do come on then will I cause you to dwell in this place if you execute judgment you oppress not you shed not and now it speaks more to their character again here in verse eight behold you trust in ly words that cannot profit this is where we get our deficit we're trusting in line Words that cannot profit we're putting our confidence in and our trust in things that cannot give us gain will you steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense unto bail and walk after other gods whom you know not he says these things because they were doing these things the word was very clear even in these 10 commandments that they were given there's these the law was given they knew the law but they're acting against the law they're acting against their conscience standing in the temple Lord saying God is Among Us the Lord is in Zion no harm will come among us and then when bad things start happening like but wait a minute God's not going to allow the temple to be torn let's just all gather here let's gather in Jerusalem surely God's not going to let these walls be torn down God's not going to let his house be forsaken but it's you that caused it to be forsaken amen stealing murdering adultery swearing falsely burning incense to other gods walking after other gods he says and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these Abominations is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even I have seen it sayith the Lord maybe there was another side to Jehovah Gyra they didn't think about good in this place God sees and that's why we come to it good amen but know that he sees he truly does see and the common theme when brother brandham addresses this is we know there's a God I wish now that maybe I would have brought more of these statements because it's just over and over again it's not because there's not a god it's not because the word's not true it's not because God hasn't Vindicated this and God hasn't made his presence known there is a God there is a God who made a promise there's a God that's present but he says but because of your own actions he says you've made even as Jesus borrows from this you've made the house of my father a dent of Thieves right a house of robbers the Lord has seen it they were going through the SE ceremony they were going through the tradition but they weren't seeking him and the contrast between David's desire in what it becomes is so remarkable because David like one thing have I desired of the Lord not that I would make money in the house of God not that I could oh that's a place where I could be hired to teach that's a place where I could Divine for money that's a place where I can I I can uh uh uh judge for reward like him that's who I want think of what we ought to be looking for when we come to church not the pretense of things what are the things we ought to be weighing when we think about where to go to church not the pretense of things there ought to be one thing desired when it comes to the house of the Lord when it referred to church it should be the word of God it should be Christ is he lifted up am I hearing things of Christ is it a place that God has pleased to manifest himself not in logistics of worship but in his word think of that it's not song service it's not even gifts and things of that but God is known by his word God is in his word that's what ought to matter more than anything beauti and I say this as I tried to enter maybe this last phase for this for a close today that do you believe you have a responsibility to seek Him the attitude was is not the Lord among us no evil can come upon us but they were no longer seeking him the attitude was the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord he's not going to cause this to fall he's not going to cause this to stumble surely we're not going to be dragged into captivity but do we have a responsibility to find the place to seek Him in light of the king of Samaria in light of these priests and teachers in light of the questions of Jeremiah and Elijah are we seeking him as we ought to in Psalms 27 the contrast between the David saying my heart shall not fear I will not be afraid to the next part to Me Maybe I'm going to start using a new word remarkable Ponder how remarkable it is that a that's a twofer is that some sort of parlay for somebody there is what he says in the beginning of what my my heart is going to be confident one thing I've desired now pay attention to the language it begins to use in this next part and and ultimately I think this is what really settled in my heart just to continue to take this direction because it seemed to be a lot of pieces and I I was so torn I want it to be encouraged and I want it to help I believe we have a positive gospel and and and and to share some of these scriptures sometimes I know that they've been used as as a bully thing and a three-pointed club to tear us down but we still have to hear these things we have to be challenged with these things uh if we could just keep it in the spirit that the messenger intended it keep it in the spirit of Christ it's needful for us amen and so I I took great comfort in recognizing that David first acknowledged the temple the house of the Lord his presence there and and then the next part is his plea so it it it it show it followed that pattern of We Know Better it show the pattern of it's not that we're ignorant and and we don't know but there's a it's settled it's established but now we're being given a template of what we ought to do to find what is expressed in those first seven verses verse eight when thou sest seek ye my face now the Lord said seek my face now we ought to think about just how outstanding that is for a God who said no man can see my face and now he says seek it well that's a game of hideand-seek that I'm never going to be able to win but he said seek it he said well we can't find it seek it you said we can't see it seek it am that's what he said seek it my heart said unto thee I love this thy face Lord will I seek Hallelujah when the word says something your mind might have a lot of things it starts Computing but does your heart say yes Lord when he says seek my face your mind says well you said that we can't see it and I don't know where it is no man can see it and live but does your heart say then I your face I will seek and I love how instinctive that is God says seek my face and the heart says thy face Lord will I seek no objection no say but you said well where is it how long what will it look like just says then I'll seek it so then he starts saying hide not thy face far from me huah put not thy servant away in anger in other words don't hide your face from me thou Hast been my help Leave Me Not Alone neither forsake me oh god of my salvation now comes the honesty now comes the recognition oh here's the enemies here's the promise here I am here's the problem here's the trouble here's the promise in the time of trouble he'll hide me now here's me and my Humanity oh don't forsake me don't leave me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up now he starts confessing the positive teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over under the will of my enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty notice David does not make the mistake of saying well I'm in the temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord is God not among us there's no way that evil could come upon us he had the attitude teach me your way lead me because of those that are out there deliver me not over to them and all these lies that are risen up against me that breathe out cruelty Lord help me I would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living faith is what sustained him he says wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart am amen by saying this David has told us his supplications are successful because this is what's happening he says seek my face in other words he doesn't say see my face right he says seek my face so David's heart says then your face I'll seek and as he starts seeking he says don't hide it from me Lord amen don't put don't turn away from me in anger you've been my help don't leave me you are my salvation don't forsake me notice the language begins to use to compel God no it's a pleading it's and the crying out to the heart of God teach me your way way Deliver Me Not Over lead me in a plain path what is this this is the waiting this is the seeking one thing have I desired that will I seek after what did he desire him what he desire the place of beauty and he said then my actions are going to match what I said when we talked about one thing desired we talked about the matching of what we do and here David saying I'm going to do I'm going to seek your face and then he says it wait on the Lord give good courage he shall strengthen thy heart wait I I say on the Lord why because he made the promise for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set me upon a rock that's a statement this my this is maybe it might be childish to say it but that's my favorite Bible verse Psalms 27:5 my absolute favorite Bible verse such a beautiful end time prophecy it's what we're living in right now the Fulfillment of but David we know when he says this in the time of trouble he's going to hide me in his Pavilion his dwelling in the secret of his habitation his tent shall he hide me there I'll see you yes amen David sought the secret place where God would show his face amen that's what he wanted and when he says this he does something that's it just the way that God does these things are you you feeling a little warm don't worry it's going to be chilly out there I think we finally got the rain to stop under the awning rains in Phoenix it rains under the roof I woke up and thought I was in a nightmare I thought I woke up in Texas but the language that David is using he's hearkening back to the language of Moses in the Exodus and he he's using these specifics because the the kind of the theme as we come to the Crux there in verse eight seek my face and David says well your face I'll seek and to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple it it implies this presence this face to face togetherness this loveliness and David is said in the time of trouble he will hide me his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle he shall set me up upon a rock David is used in a prophetic language to go back to the Exodus and in Exodus 33: 18 to 23 I'm going to skip a little bit but in the verses prior to this there a conversation going on between Moses and God and Moses is going well if you don't go with us don't send me and and how can we go forward and how are we going to be different and there's a lot of worries and concerns on Moses's part but once God has confirmed that he's with them and he'll go with them then Moses had one thing he desired that Moses this is what's so amazing this is Exodus 33 I don't know why I have a period after Exodus glory amen um there's the reason why that this is so remarkable to me is that there's something to to consider that his life for Moses it's Exodus 33 not three this is after God has appeared to him on a mountain this is after the tablets were written upon this is after he saw the plagues this is after God let him out by Mighty hand this is after striking the rock this is after there's no question of God greatness he's seen him in a pillar fire he's seen him in a A Cloud by day he knows who he's heard his voice the glory of God was seen on his face but now notice what he says at the end I beseech thee show me thy Glory what a hunger Moses wasn't satisfied to say well back then this and back then that and back in Pentecost and when I was a kid and when I was a preacher when this no he said now today right now in light of where you're taking me and where I'm going knowing that there's more show me thy [Music] Glory God says and he I will make all my goodness pass before thee all my beauty all my comeliness all my loveliness and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou cannot see my face for there shall no man see me and live now that notice the contrast stands to David now right behold there's a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock now you know what David was talking about you know the place that David was looking for when he said if for in a time of trouble you'll hide me you shall set me up upon a rock it brings it back to the language that God said David knew there was a place by him and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passees by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by oh now think of the language of the Psalms a a and this beautiful picture that's being painted in this Exodus scene and I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen right but now this is in The Exodus but now David in Psalms 27 is prophesying of a command to seek my face David is using a totally different language seek my face and my heart said oh Lord thy face will I seek there is a place by me and there will be a way consecrated and there will be a price paid where you can look me in the face and know me and see me and not tremble and faint at the gravity of it but being Washed by the blood of the Lamb being justified forever we can see the truth of God's word we could see the plainness of God's word we can see the whole plan of God open up and we're not struck with fear and faint and die but we see ourselves in a mirror as it were and we're confident that he thought of us and he knew of us and the whole plan was to bring me to him he says there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon on a rock and David says I want to be in that place that place I want to be in that place by him the Bible says in Isaiah 32: 1 and 2 Behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert that's the same word a tabernacle used in Psalms 27 and a covert a secret place of protection from The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land where is this place today David could come here's God in a very specific local very specific conversation God and Moses having this intimate conversation Moses's heart is what moved God show me thy Glory God says okay there's a place by me and I'm going to set you you up upon a rock and in that time and in that moment I'm going to allow myself to pass by and I'm going to as I pass by I'm going to let you see my backside but you can't see my face but now there's this this knowledge that there's a place by him and it's upon a rock and whatever limitations existed at that time David begins to speak of a language that I want to be in that place by you in a time of trouble I'm going to be in that place that secret place that place you spoke about to Moses I want to be in that place by you that place to seek you and in that place you say Seek my face and the Bible says a man is going to be a rock a hiding place a covert in Psalm 61: 1 to4 Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth will I cry unto you I'm asking you where is this rock where we can see him amen do we do it the king of Samaria do we do we try to read the tea leaves do we look for a dier in the world are we chasing after all these other things but do we first find the place by him do we first come to the rock is there a place that we come first and we sat down and I'm here to inquire and the Lord says what's your need well I've got this rash I've got this problem I've got this relationship issue and we begin to pour our hearts out to him and he might say well you know what you need to do you need to do this and you need to do that and we might end up going to the very places we would have sought before but now we know we're in the place by him and it's not just the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the lord it's not well God's with us he's not going to destroy us but you've come back to the one thing desired amen amen so he says when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I lead me to the place to seek Him am Brothers you can come to your instruments for thou Hast been a shelter for me and a strong power from the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the cover of thy Wings amen say it's so beautiful thou has been a shelter for me a strong tower and he uses the language lead me to the Rock and the rock is where the Tabernacle the rock is where the temple the rock is where the house of the Lord amen and that's where we trust the language now the cover of his wings it even brings into view The Mercy Seat there's so much visual things that we could start looking at the Tabernacle the Wilderness the temple all the elements all the symbols everything it's God pointing a large thought that I had pulled out of this is just how that God was using the Tabernacle using the temple as a means of expressing something to us that we could look at that and then begin to understand this is what it represented this what it represented and so I'm asking you where is it today if we believed that that place today was in Jerusalem we should be there right there's some people today that believe it's in Jeffersonville and that's why they're there and got to be careful how you judge people because many are just acting upon what they've been taught and what they believe very deeply and very strongly and so I'm not preaching to them none of them are streaming this that's a play they don't push but I'm asking you who are here where is this place by him today I'm asking you this I'm I can't tell you I I it can say well it's here and I could even tell you what I think it is but still I would be using a language that could mean nothing to you unless you knew where that place was for you oh it's right here Arizona Believers Church if you're not here you're not getting it well that's a lie that's just another the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord the Temple of the Lord just another lie you're trusting in in false words lying words we'd be no better off than them in Jeremiah 7 no better than the king uh Samaria that went after the god of erron that that there's nothing in that but we got to find him where's the place that you seek him maybe I could ask it that way where's the place you seek him where is the place you find him sometimes we need to stop and recognize I've left him and go back to the place that we left them and I promise that's where you'll find them every time amen because there is a God because the message is true amen it is real there is a God and he loves you your salvation is real your healing is real all these things are true they're real then why do these things befall us because we're not at the place to seek him unless there be any inaccurate picture painted if the place to seek him so there's just no magic in being there you got to wait David as he begins to plead hide not thy face from me even as Moses came came to that rock that was by him he said now I'm going to do something you're going to come to this place that is by me what beautiful language and thou shalt stand upon a rock and then as my glory passes by I'm going to put you in the Cliff of a rock and I'll cover thee with my hand while I pass by you notice that there'll be a time that he's passing by that you don't actually know it quite yet right he's there he's passing by but then he says and I'll take away away my hand at just the right moment I'll take away my hand and so he says just wait wait wait we're pleading we're pleading keep pleading keep waiting wait on the Lord just wait wait be of good courage he'll strengthen your heart wait and what was the heart the strength in the heart it matches his heart's desire thy face will I seek seek my face my heart says your face will I seek he'll strengthen your heart by giving your heart's desire amen but you got to stay in that place don't come off the rock don't climb away stay and wait because at the time that he'll remove his hand it won't be his backside you see it'll be his face and sometimes we're just too eager we're trying to we we we don't get patient enough and we don't wait to where his face is revealed amen help us Lord God Bless you that's we're just finished for this morning if you could just stand with me while we pray
