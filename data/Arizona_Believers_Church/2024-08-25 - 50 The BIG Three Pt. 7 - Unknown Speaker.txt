TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to continue on the subject of the big three and just review a few things very quickly from the last uh from Wednesday night and kind of touches on a little bit from last Sunday but we were looking at the big three the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life those have been the few things we've been covering in this series on the big three and how that they are run in Tangent with the uh Temptation Of Money women and popularity and most recently we've been looking at the lust of the eyes and that connection with women as brother B says those Temptations are money women and popularity and how that Samson represents not just the temptation to women but that's associated with the lust of the eyes and how that Samson's life demonstrates in the scripture that he was seduced and deceived LED astray by women not just one time but he found himself being tempted and always put in a compromising situation uh wherein the woman was to blame or at least the the factor in enticing him and as it says in first John that all that is in the world is the lust of the eye the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life we're saying that these big three are all that is in the world as Satan has designed it has the intent to deceive uh and to distract us if he can't deceive us he certainly wants to distract Us by it wouldn't it be something that if the devil sets something up to deceive and in seeing it and it's deceptive to us and we realize it's deception but all we did is spend our time railing against against it it's just as successful because it's now worked as a distraction and so the lust of the flesh we we identified how that relates to the body and how that we have see taste feel smell and hear and that it's through those channels that we might give some bodily thirst or human needs preeminence and the lust of the flesh drives us we saw that in the garden when the woman saw that it was good for food we see it in the wilderness when Christ was tempted that he was tempted to turn stones to bread and that's the temp ation of the lust of the Flesh and with the lust of the eyes it relates to the the mind of the person the spirit where you have this imagination conscience memory reason and affection and it's in there that you're both emotional and intellectual so we they're they're both guilty together and when one is implicated the other's implicated so if brother brandom's saying something against emotionalism don't desire to be intellectual brother brother BR saying something that kind of tampered down just while enthusiasm without truth he's not just saying that so that we just become intellectual when one is guilty the other is handcuffed to it and the other one is just as guilty because they're both these states of being wherein we are not in the balance of the word of God but we're either distracted or deceived and we're in these fringes so both are guilty and implicated because the spirit of a man can be both emotional and intellectual and at the same time and or they can lean to one or the other in the emphasis of either one at the expense of the truth is just as wrong and as we looked uh on Wednesday I think we spent a lot of time on this looking into the word of God how that Satan has uh manipulated uh humanity and even designed the genders and worked on them in a way to seduce to Blind and then to bind we saw that in Samson where first he's enticed uh and he loses his strength and then he's bound and then he's blinded he loses his insight and this is so both naturally and spirit spiritually how that we can be tempted to lust in the physical but then there's also a spiritual application where there's some unfaithfulness to the word of God and remember always that Satan is the author of The Big Three he's the one that has perverted money he's perverted uh the uh women and he's perverted Fame because we can say well just because someone is known doesn't necessarily mean they're evil uh just because we uh you're a woman doesn't mean you're inherently evil and just because you might have money doesn't mean you're inherently lost but he's perverted those different things so that they can be a distraction or stumbling block or deception and he's the one that does that God is the author of all things pure and righteous he's a giver of good things and we can receive things and know that they're from the hand of the Lord but then Satan wants to twist and pervert and manipulate so that the outcome or the effect of the blessing is not there but some sort of deception or binding and ultimately a blinding I was thinking about this last week and step fellowshipping with my wife and I wanted to and it just was coming to my heart just to point this out as we've been speaking on the house of the Lord and that's the temple or the Tabernacle and we've been making this uh and we spent a lot of time in that area and then we begin to look at the big three and what we've been doing and looking at these Temptations is applying those Temptations of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life to you as an individual which is your heart is to be a house of the Lord and to us as a family uh in your own family or your home life and then to the church so as you would have personal Temptations uh that may be money women or popularity personal Temptations in the flesh and the eyes and the pride of life that would relate to you as an individual and how that God desires to have preeminence or to possess you wholly and how that these three things are trying to uh interrupt God's program for your life we could see that in your personal Temptations and within a family it can relate to a family standard and what you emphasize within your home and what you lift up and what has preeminence and then as a church again it just it comes down to what's the character of the church what is its emphasis uh what is its attraction and I think those things work the same way what are you attracted to In the Flesh what does a family lift up as the attraction and so looking at these different things is associated with those themes that we've been identifying in the house of the Lord now right here is where I want to pick up we were on this this Wednesday night the lust of the eyes as we are have we linked it to women and this temptation of women and how Satan uses women it's not just to be tempted to lust after a female or to even as a woman would be tempted to lust after a man that's not just it but it is Beauty and vanity in whatever form Satan's trying to use it in and we see that a woman in scripture represents a church and that woman being representative a church it represents organization represents denominationalism uh denominational Spirits Cult of Personality of movements anything that is uh that Satan is driving anything that he's using to try to keep you from truth in The Sermon Just Once More Lord where brother bradam is using the example of Samson he's talking about the Pentecostal move or the Pentecostal age he says just even take 10 or 15 years back look how it's declined since then look how it's went down down down it's got so it's almost a shame a fella feels embarrassed almost to talk about Divine Healing there's been so much reproach brought upon it he says talk about the Holy Ghost when so much reproach has been brought upon it now these are two tenants that we could say of the restoration of their gifts Divine Healing uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's saying that there's been so much nonsense taking place within the Pentecostal movement that even though you would believe in it if you were to say something about Divine Healing there'd be this association with this Pentecostal movement you were to talk about the Holy Ghost it'd be assoc assciated with the Pentecostal movement and brother Bram is not saying he's ashamed to be identified as a Holy Roller he's not saying that he's ashamed to be identified with Divine Healing or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the manifestation of the spirit in the gifts but he's saying those associated with those things are bringing a reproach on the gospel he said it's not God it's not God it's not God's fault he says it's Samson that has left off the principles of God's word and has substituted something else and let the organization shave him down woo him into it so the Temptation is the organization Samson was tempted by delilo ultimately that was his uh near down complete downfall we know God restored him in the end but there's a substitute and the organization shaves you down and Woos you into the substitute so I encourage you to catch the principle so that you can always make present day application if we're drawing from uh things in the scripture and we say well they didn't have to worry about cell phones then and they didn't have to worry about this and you get real rigid with what God's trying to teach in terms of the principle and you leave it in history and you leave it only in that context you can't catch the thought that God's trying to bring out of it you can get entangled with modern-day applications that you have no the word isn't available to you to defend against it so we want to catch the principle uh for application if it is applicable then the sermon turn on the light he says we've passed around 60 years the the Pentecostals have organized we are this we are that so again this organization is what I'm want you to look at that's that female or the the woman this temptation and it's not uh it's not putting a spotlight on the gender but the church we are this we are that and God has walked right away from it out in Yonder and bringing forth a bride an elect out of that group so God's walked away from this Pentecostal organization or or the temptation of the Pentecostalism to organize and he says God's not working in that anymore he's going to call you out of that he said there'll never be another church age the Philadelphian Church age was Wesley and the Le in church age is the Pentecostal organization which all goes right straight into the mark of the beast that's the Bible as brother was saying a few moments ago now this I'm I'm reading these things to build to this momentous statement they are all them organizations because so now we're getting the definition of what it means to be an organization they're all organizations because they refuse to walk in further light they organize themselves saying we believe this when he says they refuse to walk in further light they may see it but they resist following it they may recognize it to be light but they don't really follow it or to yield themselves to it and submit to it and this is you you can determine this by the way they live the way they act what they emphasize so they are all organizations and you become an organization if you refuse to walk in further light I think of the context of this that you are going to be uh maybe I'm just trying to think of a way to say this and I I'm hoping to expound upon this in a greater way because I believe according to the message of the hour that we should all be Capital K's P Pentecostal we that's what we should be we should be Pentecostal but there's a lot of ideas attached to it that people want to capitalize right and that really in what some ways is what brother bandam called Pentecostalism so there is a genuine Pentecost is a Pentecostal experience that every person must have if you're going to be a part of the body of Christ there's a true Pentecost there's a true restoration of Pentecost and then there's all those things that's associated with it that people want to say is indeed Pentecost but really those things aren't necessarily the Pentecostal experience or what is Pentecost and what happens is they get organized around these other things related to it and as soon as you organ and refuse to walk further in light that is what becomes Pentecostalism was when you refuse to walk further in light said they organized themselves saying we believe this and what is he emphasizing period put a period on it go no further or you just emphasizing some partial truth as we saw in the spirit of balum he could repeat one thing God said but he didn't want to repeat the other because it didn't serve his ends it didn't meet his means and so in failing to walk further in the light we can look at the sense of there's there's no growth there's no maturity they just kind of stay very uh set in their ways and and they're not they're not growing in the word of God so the lure of the eyes the lust of the eyes and as it's typified with this temptation of women I want to say this it'll either hold you back or drag you back the lust of the eyes will either keep you from going forward or make you go backwards this is the Temptation in the wilderness and why so many perished after The Exodus from Egypt is they didn't want to go further into the promised land and some wanted to go back into Egypt and so the lust of the eyes will either keep you from going forward or it'll drag you right back to some other age or some other time and it'll do so by manipulating the mind to intellect or manipulating the mind to emotionalism now in Jude verse 8 well start with verse 8 and we'll read about these that are uh that are being re compared to or the spirit that's being compared to how one was once LED out of but then destroyed because they don't go all the way because of a lack of faith or how that some had first uh habitation but then they fall away and they're going to be facing judgment he says likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh this is you got to think uh in terms of those who have come amongst the Church of God using religion and some sort of spin uh trying to bring people back into bondage they're they're Antichrist though they speak speak of Christ he says they despise dominion and speak evil of dignities now there's a certain personality trait here some kind of outstanding characteristic about the way they talk and what they emphasize he says even Michael when he was disputing with Satan didn't bring railing accusations but just said the Lord rebuke thee so there was not uh there's something in the manner which is betraying what they're saying he says but these speak evil of things which they know not is it this A A like a lot of people where they see something and they just speak against it speak evil of it not even knowing anything about it they speak evil H H uh the spirit of God can move and manifest in a certain way oh that's just a bunch of nonsense God doesn't do that anymore there's no such thing as speaking in tongues there's no such thing is being emotional that's and they just speak EV knowing nothing about it and on the other foot sometimes they see something and it doesn't look the way they want it they just be that's just dead that's cold that's formal God's not in it and they're speaking of things that they don't don't know because if someone's never experienced the Holy Ghost and wept or shouted or felt good because the power of God's moving upon them they can speak evil of it not knowing about it someone's never experienced the depths of the revelation of God's word and how it can just hold you Spellbound when the word is going forth they can speak evil about it not knowing anything about it but they know naturally what they know naturally as brute beast in those things they corrupt themselves we will corrupt ourselves in those things that we can only apprehend naturally naturen whether it be the things of the Mind the lust of the eyes those things which we can know by the body or the flesh we will corrupt ourselves in no matter how we try to phrase them in a way to make it seem spiritual or righteous or good we will corrupt ourselves in those things that we know naturally but it's only in those things that we know by Revelation that are Incorruptible just as there is no amount of gold that you can add to real gold to turn into Fool's Gold there's no amount of word that you can add to Faith to ever make your faith intellectual Faith or a false Faith wo unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain I'm reading all these things to focus on this first indictment they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the heir of balam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of Kora the heir of balam for reward there's your temptation to money there's the lust of the flesh the gain saying of Kora is rooted in the pride of life I think we're going to pick up on that maybe Wednesday next Sunday those things are uh related to The Big Three and I'm just putting it in this way so that we can apprehend it I'm not making that a Doctrine if you don't necessarily see that you're you're out and you're disagreeing with something you don't know of but we're just using it as a way for the scripture to come alive to you and comprehend it they've gone in the way of Cain ran greedily after the heir of balum for reward and perished in the gain saying of Kora as we've examined Samson let's look at the way of Cain in Judas we we've already read from verse four we see that he's associated with the spirit of Seduction these filthy dreamers they defile the flesh he's associated with uh rebellion and Disobedience we know that Cain was a murderer who envied the simple worship of his brother Abel and we could even say this that Cain really at the core was a son of the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life he was the product of that Temptation and those three aspects of it in the beginning and as a matter of fact we say all that is in the world the less of the flesh the less of the eyes and the pride of life produced Cain and he's the reason why we have the big three because it it all comes from that tree in the sermon the mark of the beast and the Seal of God part two I think we read some of this on Wednesday but we we're going to read just back up a couple sentences brother B's talking about these signs shall follow them that believe and how that that's a scriptural principle that you can't reject you can't do away with and and having spent some time looking at those things and what man can make of it and what those signs are that follow the believer and that God's the one that will do it and it's a promise and we believe that he does he he's using that as a truth and emphasizing how some people might want to water that down or get away from and he says you can't get out of the Scripture it brings itself right back and balances itself up each time that's what scripture does it's only when you get out of scripture that you get imbalanced but if you stay in scripture if there's one scripture there's another scripture and it all brings this great balance he says but Cain he wanted something beautiful Beauty that's the attraction of the eye the Catholic Church learned that long ago that through the eye is the gate to the soul to make Beauty and so forth and the people fall for that when you travel not so much in in America but in South America Central America and even around the world sometimes the most beautiful places and the greatest tourist attractions are Cathedrals and they're orn and they're dramatic and they were the tallest buildings in the world at their time and existed for sometimes centuries as the tallest structure because as we look at it here if we put it in this context they learned that if the eye can be enamored with it if you can catch the eye you can catch the heart if you can get somebody through the visual if you can get someone in the mind if you can win somebody's passions uh then you've gained their commitment you've gained their faith and that's how that he says uh Hollywood learned that a long time ago the devil knew it before you did that's exactly right that's the technique he works on the same thing he set himself a more beautiful kingdom it's always been beautiful so this is Satan's method of operation he worked solely in Beauty again you can't take the opposite of that and say oh where it's ugly it's God that's not what's meant but Satan Works only in Beauty so that it's a Whited supper but inside is death uh it it's it's presenting itself one way in reality it's hypocrisy uh and it's it's not what it is purported to be so there's a Satan Works in Beauty he works through the eye the attraction of the eye and that's what was working on Cain this is what works in the way of Cain brother bam continues don't look at Beauty look at truth not Beauty that's what's the matter with the church today it's jumping for beauty and dying that's right because it gets death so it's jumping for for beauty now there is a going back to the house of the Lord this may seem real directed towards church uh in US as Believers and the spirits that exist in the age today to defile our thoughts or distract us or deceive us and that's certainly true but make application to Family Life make application to your individual life how that we could be jumping for beauty in its corrupting we find that Cain went from God and took himself a wife out of another group in the land of nod that's exactly what the man does that will not come up and worship God in spirit and Truth Listen a man that wants worship God in spirit and Truth he goes off and gets him a church that will satisfy him now gets him a church that'll satisfy him where in the soul in the faith in the word or satisfy him outwardly in a way that he wants to be tickled in the way that he wants to be itched in the sermon the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said says Cain was justified if God only required that an altar or worship said but God rejected him because his Spirit only looked to a thing temporal I'm wanting to show you according to the word of God what the lust of the eye is related to what this temptation to women is related to the way of Cain which looks for beauty jumps at be Beauty and only looks at something temporal the things that will fade the things that have to constantly be uh followed up on I think one of the things that comes up in uh some news reporting now in some studies is what are the long-term ramifications of Botox right and they're saying well this stuff was supposed to be gone years ago and it stays in people's system and who knows what's going to happen they might start birthing plastic children but there's uh there these things are temporal they they they fade away they go away and and Mankind is only interested in certain things that only last temporarily in the mind in the body that will ultimately die that man can destroy that can be healed in a Fantastical way in a miraculous way but only to get sick again a body that can uh praise God and shout and be happy and turn right around and sin and defile it so there's it's this interest in temporal things he says he was the nature of his daddy his daddy wanted a great big beautiful Church in heaven better than Michael he got kicked out of heaven for there so hears his nature down here beautifying The Altar and here it is yet today they make a big fine churches and he says you Pentecostal people are just as bad off as the rest of them that's the attention to temporal details and not Eternal things and the sermon marriage and divorce brother Bram says Satan is the one who features that kind of beauty if we'll notice he was the most beautiful of all the angels in heaven and he Des to make Heaven a more beautiful place than the kingdom of Michael if we could say this that heaven was created by or formed or manifested by the word of God the word is enough I but Satan felt like well if we could just add a few things to this then uh we can make it better but God's word is enough whatever it is whatever it looks like whatever it holds these signs shall follow them that believe it doesn't matter if you think that's radical or ugly B being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ full immersion that seems ridiculous it's the word it's beautiful in itself it's perfect in itself you don't have to add to it but there's this way of Cain that doesn't want to just look at Faith or Revelation but says I can improve that I make I can make that better said also to show that Cain was his son the son of that Spirit the son of that ideology he offered a more beautiful worship decorated his altars with fruits and flowers and so forth beautiful sin is beautiful what we call today sin is deceiving by Beauty says you'll never you'd never look at a woman going down the street and tell her what's in her heart but I wanted to say these things that you can see see why that Satan is her designer and think the way he's saying is you would never just walk up to a woman and say you may be beautiful but spiritually you're ugly right he's not wanting to do that but he's saying I wanted to say these things so you could see how Satan is her designer he said that's exactly right his own son proved it came I know that's maybe heavy language but Cain then being the the son of that Spirit birth through the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life was in his nature that when he went to worship and build an altar that what he built was something beautiful and without much consideration as to whether or not it's accepted now we could say well what why blame him he's born that way right he's born that way he this is all that he knew and even brother says as he was taught by his parents in the garden so maybe there was a way that Adam and the woman were koi a little bit and didn't exactly tell him and so he just kind of goes with what he knows and he tries to offer it in such a way to where H HH he's being sincere and brother brandom even says he wasn't being a smart alec he was being sincere he worshiped he was sincere in every way that Abel was but the way of Cain when it says way it's a way of thinking feeling and acting a way is the way you think the way you feel the way you act if you feel a certain way you'll act according to those feels if you think a certain way you'll act way so whether you're emotional or intellectual ultimately your way is way of thinking feeling and acting and the way of Cain it's a very interesting word as I was studying trying to study it out in the Hebrew and there's a lot of a lot of Rich scholarship and I won't uh wow you with slides on the Hebrew but it comes from even the when Eve said I have gotten a man from the Lord that it's uh she has Acquired and so he's named Cain and it seems the the verb acquired or got the connect in the in the Hebrew that the name is uh closely associated with that which means we we translate to buyer or acquire but it also is associated with and means to make or fabricate and it's to forge to fit together so Kane is a maker he's a fabricator one that fits together and he forges so this is at his heart this is in his nature but now as after he has offered up spiritual sacrif or he's offered up a sacrifice to the Lord and God has respect to Abel's sacrifice at that moment in his sincerity he could have said Abel that was amazing how did that happen yours was the smelliest ugliest scariest thing I've ever seen in my life over there whacking at a lamb and it's bleeding and it's blood everywhere and it's crazy and I'm over here with Cales and everything's very beautiful and you can eat it afterwards and everything's great and God respected yours but not mine let's let's what what happened but he gets jealous and in his jealousy and rage God comes to him and says hey if you just do right you'll be accepted and the way of Cain manifest itself because Cain doesn't say all right I'll go talk to Abel and we'll I'll I'll find out what I can do I I I want to be right he goes to Abel and murders him he kills him and then after he kills his brother God curses him and at that point surely Cain is not just Bound By Nature and nurture surely at that point he has seen enough externally and supernaturally to provoke some good in his heart somewhere to say oh my goodness what has happened to me I've become murderous in my my mistakes even I was sincere and I was corrected but I'm not and surely at that moment so let's see what the way of Cain is God said I'm going to put a mark on you or or he says I'm going to banish you and send you out and he goes here's the way of Cain Genesis 4: 13- 14 and Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear yeah what about Abel's punishment right and he's he's the victim my I'm being persecuted My Punishment is greater than I could bear I I I've worshiped I've praised you I've done what you've asked behold thou Hast driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from th thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me what you will not find in this is any repentance any hint whatsoever about the fact that his own half brother was just murdered nothing about the fact that he just robbed life as the first murderer he's only worried about what his image and his flesh he's only worried about what people think about him and what will happen to him he has nothing offered in any way whatsoever to say I'm sorry what can I do how how can we fix this he you know what he could have said my punishment is greater than I can bear but I've earned every bit of it my punishment is greater than I can bear I'll be a fugitive I'll be a vagabond people seek to slay me but I've brought this upon myself nothing of that in other words he's pleading to God hey could you kind of protect me a little bit here and then you'll find that Cain's ways manifested in his family in the civilization they form this is at the heart of the way of Cain the pretense the Optics the the image the the flesh do you realize what it would have meant for him to Humble himself to Abel and say you were right I was wrong and instead of doing that he postured and became murderous we know today that all it takes is to speak against someone wrongfully and murder their character to be of The Same Spirit Cain's way is manifested then in the sons that he begins to Bear the civilization they begin to form they built cities they made instruments musical instruments they forged weapons and armor they were Smiths any Smiths here today that the name Smith it's in tuban it speaks of someone like a gold smith or a blacksmith they were they were uh they had they were Tradesmen who formed things and fabricated things literally Cain is and some say literally A Smith this is in the nature of Cain the way of Cain is to build something to look good he built the city they built instruments they built weapons and armor they they they forg themselves a mighty image and the way of Cain we know scripturally leads to Vain worship Rebellion without consequence works with no heart worship without truth there are a number of ways that we could begin to emphasize what the way of Cain is and it's the way of Cain that spreads through all the face of the Earth so look at Genesis 6: 1 to 8 Genesis 6: 1-8 I'm wanting you to ident see here the way of Cain and it came to pass when men be to multiply in the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wise of all which they chose now do you recognize what just happened the sons of Cain were having do and their daughters and the sons of Seth saw them that they were beautiful and married them chose them so this is where there's this mixing there's this intermingling these beautiful daughters of Cain this is where you can see then the way of Cain through Beauty through seduction through the woman and the sons of God see them begin to marry and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with men for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them and the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of renown this is the way of Cain as That civilization begin to mix with those that called upon the name of the Lord those humble sons and civil family of Seth uh uh through Adam and the woman through Adam and Eve as they begin to marry into that family they begin to take on the identity of the way of Cain and they were caught up in the beauty became men of renown less humble less seeking of God to where verse 5 and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fouls of the air for it repenteth me that I've made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord he was one who had resisted this beauty this way of Cain we see here in Genesis 6 that the daughters of Cain lured the sons of Seth through Beauty through seduction and lust and the product was Men of renown uh Giants and great Beauty and brother bradam looking at Cain in the way of Cain he says oh those reprobates are religious they're smart they are the Cain line the serpent seed now before we start looking around for literal serpents in here if you're born of a woman you're hybrid he said they build their battles they babbles they build their cities they build their Empires and all the while calling on God it's religious cults right they build their cities their Empires Their Kingdoms their Cults all the while calling on God over and over again brother Bram identifies the way of Cain or Cain with false religion false Vine falsely anointed false Union false uh wife false church over and over and over again he said there's a false Holy Ghost baptism a false Holy Spirit baptism he said the devil is impersonated because he's religious Cain his father was religious so there's even a false Holy Spirit baptism in the way of Cain now I have several quotations I want to read to you here uh to emphasize this to the message of the hour on this lust of the eye capitalizing how it can work on you as an individual and I think you can you can think in terms of lust how the world is trying to find some way to get in your mind to lust and to act upon that lust in a physical sense in that real visceral fleshly sense but then there's also these temptations that we can have on a family level uh where we're drawn to certain things lust of the eye then there's this spiritual application that I'm looking at right now but it has brought application we'll try to move through this rather quickly I'm taking these from all sermons once more just once more and different places where brother brandham is ministering on the example of Samson he said and here he stands Samson the last organization of the church Pentecost was just as defeated as Samson was so here he stands and then he says Pentecost this afternoon was just as defeated as Samson was you might not believe that but you'll just open your mind to the word you'll see it's the truth they had him doing tricks for entertainment I I want you to think very deeply about this lust of the flesh lust of the eye he said what's the matter with this diluted Church the world has punctured its eyes don't you know Jesus said this would happen and when the sleeping virgin come to buy oil she never got it there's the sleeping virgin Lutheran method Methodist Presbyterian they're not getting it they might speak with tongues and jump but that don't mean anything I've seen heathens do the same thing devil worshippers speak in tongues jump Sing and Shout drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil and speak in tongues don't you rely on Sensations it's the word of God that don't come it's the word of God that don't pass there she is defeated just as much as Samson Was Defeated doing tricks now how Satan stands up and laughs at them saying look they claim they believe the Bible look now some could probably take this say don't rely on Sensations and try to drive that down to say Sensations are of the devil but guess what Sensations are Sensations are of the human right Sensations are of the living and the holy spirit moves and it's just human to respond to it but the caution is don't cabbage down on a physiological response to a supernatural thing and tell yourself that because you could say yes to it or you could feel it that that's enough so it's it's he's not trying to become uh one-sided here but he's saying you might speak with tongues you might jump you might dance you might shout but if you're only doing that you're doing tricks for entertainment if that's the emphasis if that's the must if that's the have to if that's what makes us the bride's Revival as we do that that's easy if that we'll just take we'll just have dance lessons well we'll get a vocal coach that can teach us how to shout and not lose our voice this that would be the easiest bar to be a bride is if we could just make it magic to learn to do tricks little smoking mirrors and make people think God's moving says don't rely on Sensations it's the word that'll never pass away he says they're defeated Delilah has punctured their eyes so they can't see the truth says another thing about a lot of this modern evangelism today all the way from Pentecost all the way back it's a bunch of Hollywood Showmanship ship he says I see the spirit of Hollywood I see the spirit of world I see the spirit of Glamour go right on through I've been 15 years preaching against it just worsening all the time I can see it I can see the spirit there but where is the spirit of God that can grasp God that can recognize the word itself when it's made manifest can recognize truth notice this Jun Theos of the word of God being made manifest and revealed and somebody saying I that it's revealed to them that's truth not what they know as Man by their corrupt desires and by their fleshly desires but something that they can only know by Revelation he says where is the spirit of God that can recognize the word recognize truth not just the visual things he said only the spirit of God can do that you take you can take glitter polish Showmanship Samson had just a big a body as he ever had but his strength was taken from him the church Pentecost today stands have they swapped the truth for glitter for poers for Showmanship do we do the same in our individual lives do we do it as a family where we're we're we're postering to look good and to fit in to have the Instagram life are we doing things so that we can look like we have everything put together you can take glitter polish and Showmanship he says but this Pentecostal modern evangelism today is a bunch of Hollywood Showmanship it's platform posturing it it it's it's all about the show he said what a condition it is an air he says if we could only stop like Samson did and just think a moment of what we're supposed to be by God's Bible not a great big something not going keeping up with the Joneses but a humble reverent Spirit-filled little group of people not shining glowing Hollywood shines the gospel glows we want something shiny the biggest churches we've ever had we'd be better off if we stood down at the valley in the alley in a store room and have the spirit of God back on us again again the way of Cain big beautiful flashy Showmanship doing things for show he knew Samson knew there was a possibility but the thing of it today is the people don't seem to have have come conscious that there is a possibility they're satisfied to go right on down the old Trend they're going don't do that believe God have faith in him now they say oh they we sit tight that's right we'll clap our hands and everything and Shout but you were all sails and no anchor how can you clap your hands and shout and deny the word being the truth how can you clap your hands and shout and the Holy Spirit will walk among you and then you say oh it's telepathy it's something that's just not worth it think of what he's trying to call out again make this catch the concept and the principle so the spirit can make application we have Great Gatherings glitter worldly tinsil great meetings and what do we get more members the Pentecostal Church three years ago put more members in it than all the rest of the churches together all kinds of scholarship men learned to talk in schools and say their speeches intellectual Hollywood showmen pardon the expression preaching to a bunch of so-called Pentecostal grandchildren this is what Samson represents Hollywood showman Hollywood Showmanship Hollywood shining tinsel glitter Polish people who have learned to talk maybe it does manifest itself in cold intellectualism where there's just inspired preaches uh preachers just teaching things and the congregation just doing its best to try to absorb it as brother Brandon called out and and that's one ditch that's one side that's one lust of the eye and the lust of the flesh but on the other side too when we implicate the intellectual when we implicate the emotional they're both joined together guilty Hollywood Showman and brother Bram says this and just once more Lord and I believe these are from shreport if you look at uh brother Jack Moore that Pentecostal faith that he had so where voice of healing began and started and Noti the things brother Bram says they call for Revival Revival Revival reval but they haven't recognized The Awakening of the Bride they can feel the pull of the hour there's a way that they can express themselves in worship and praise and the gifts but they miss the truth now anybody could say well we're not rejecting truth but by their fruits you'll know them when they say well we've received the full word of God but you don't have to do this you have to do that and this doesn't matter but this matters and they begin to say this is what we believe and put a period on it and they won't walk further in the light they can say well we believe the light well then come on into it they are they that are categorized as borderline believers they have entered into the promised land with the bride and fought for a season but they wanted their inheritance on the wrong WR side of Jordan and they've gone back on the other side of Jordan to settle down and erect a very large altar in a large Church to intimidate and to threaten those who've settled in their Promised Land he says something has stripped her talking about the church the same thing that stripped Samson all caused by listening to a woman that took him in and what stripped the church is listening to that organized woman situation I like the way he just phrased that the organized women woman situation words it doesn't have to be an officialorg doesn't have to be an actual denomination it just has to be an organized woman situation and O WS they have a little code now oh and he says and what stripped the church is listening to the organized woman situation that old Jezebel the very thing that Samson had been raised up to defeat had defeated him and the Pentecostal Church stands in those same tracks tonight the very thing they were called out of the very thing that the restoration of the gifts the very thing that the move of God in the last age was to call them out of was an organized Philadelphia age an organization they've gone right back into it the very thing she was raised up to defeat denominationalism she's grouped herself back into it again and her power is gone the power of the Lord left her by what organizing he says denominationalism he says how Samson had failed him the very nation that Samson was raised up to destroy had bound him and the very thing that God raised Pentecost to do has them bound stripped of Fellowship stripped of power fussing stewing lukewarm members that's the that's the mark that you read it in Jude the very thing that Pentecost represented unorganized non-denominational they begin to organize around what doctrinal their own doctrines their own Creeds evidences they begin to try divide lines and split up it's the spirit of denominationalism to put a period to emphasize One Truth at the expense of others and he says what caused it it was not exactly his natural eyes put out but it was his spiritual sight put out that he let Delila wo him into it so it's not the natural sight Lost first it's spiritual and that's what's hindered the church today is the spiritual Insight of the word of God has been swapped for a bunch of Creeds remember the deed the doctrine and death maybe something happens but then you make it a standard the unbending way you make it a Creed that's the eye the devil has first thing could do is put your eyes out and tell you it's a bunch of Holy Rollers it's this it's that or the other or some Devil's mood move or Al telepathy or something on that order if you could punch your eyes out you're in darkness like well you're spending a lot of time emphasizing emotionalism and shouting and dancing well I'm doing it as brother brandham says it trying to keep with what he said and guess what if he's given a a rebuke to those who emphasize emotions he rebukes those who criticize it say it's nothing but a bunch of holy rollers and Devil's move and mental telepathy and some emotional workup I spent my time last week reading over statements where brother bam was calling out that spirit that criticized IES a genuine move of God that can manifest itself on human beings what else are they supposed to do right spirit of God can move in an audience and people cry and people dance and there's a shout that goes up and there's an order to it and there's times where brother the most powerful anointing you're Spellbound you're quiet you're sober he tells you to sober up when he's teaching onc in one place he says you need to qu we need to quiet ourselves down so we can catch this back in Genesis and what is he trying to do is to keep us out of some modality or some uh H uh tradition that we rest in saying we've got to and see the truth of the word of God and accept it and embrace it and let it do its thing so yes there's a finger pointed at the intellectuals the cult the formal the word rejectors who say well we believe the word of God we believe the revelation we believe the open of the word but then call something that is of god Unholy and the same goes to those who say we're not word rejectors we believe the word but then right out of their own mouth they deemphasize truth Genesis 4:3 says in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord Brother bam says Cain built an altar and he says an altar is a church a place of worship so what he wanted to be and being like God was something different than God so what he wanted to be and being like God was something different than God is there is equality there because you realize there's some that Satan is an impersonator so he wanted to be like God he wanted to be like the most high when your eyes are open you'll become as Gods there was something in his gospel that's not too far off maybe in the fundamental structure of what God wants in a wife or in his bride but the difference is what God is the difference is in who he really is in his character and so some people have the conception that Jesus is a John Wayne he's a Rambo he's a Donald Trump and so that's what they think the word is and that's what they want to become and it's not wrong to be like Christ but when your Christ is Antichrist it's wrong it's not wrong to be like your heavenly Father which is perfect but when you've perverted the character of your heavenly father that's imperfect Satan drew his own conception said he's a good god he's overall nature I'll get the beans and potatoes too much starch too much lectin too many carbs he says and I'll get the flowers and I'll make him a real pretty altar brother said that's a church K's way is religious remember it's Rebellion without consequence Works without heart Spirit without truth worship without truth because then you just all you have to do is just say well you know did did really did Cain do anything wrong don't you think if he's talking to God and he really was wrong he would have said I'm you're right I'm wrong but look he was the victim Genesis 4:16 Cain went out from the presence of the Lord dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden on the East of Eden indicates a religious way a religious move brother B said see how religious it was the east side it's just like lot this was the way of Cain is inherently religious the way of Cain is inherently the lust of the eye not in a way to where the devil I had some statements here I don't know if I have them in here maybe I do I just forgot that I have a lot more things to read but he talks about seeing uh prostitutes in France I think it was he said if you thought you were going to see something vulgar and filthy in terms of something ugly and downtrodden and Drug addled or something he's like that's not the way it happened Satan tries to present it in a very very beautiful way and just once more Lord again continuing on to Life Tabernacle he says the church could only knew that there was a possibility but the people don't seem to to catch the vision yet they don't seem to catch it there's a little possibility it doesn't come through you can shout a little more Pat your hands a little more or dance a little more that isn't it no it's back to the word there is a possibility of coming back and getting the word on the inside again you bypassed it there notice they sit tight oh sure they clap their hands yes sir but you see that's all SS without any anchor I've seen the heathens clap their hands and do dance speak in tongues and do all those things an interpret it but they were African heathens sure I've seen them lay a pencil down and watch a witch doctor stood there and made the pencil stand up run up and down in place up there and come back and play like and shave a hair cut two bits draw it out on an unknown tongue and wrote it out and one of them stood there interpreting it you can't rely on that many of them speak in tongues and they deny the very principles of Jesus Christ I took my Bible laid it right out to a man him standing there speaking in tongue says brother this is exactly I don't even want see it glory to God I know Jesus said I don't care about the rest Hallelujah glory to God like that why a man that would turn his back upon truth and actually put on a shind dig like that to keep from seeing the truth that's hypocrisy in the heights of it listen using that against the word well I don't I don't care what the brother said I don't care what Jesus said I don't care about the glory to God hallelujah and he says put on a dick to to reject the word that's the heights of hypocrisy just because he would have to give up his Fellowship card if he accepted what was truth in other words when you when you get in the premium group right to stand for the full word of God might get you kicked out he said that's worse than Samson why is it worse than Samson those locks will never grow back she'll keep his head shaved doing tricks remember brother B said That's what Satan had been or Samson had been reduced to diluted doing tricks Showmanship entertainment he says the thing of it is that people have gotten so wound up into the world and the world and them till they have just just enough religion to make them miserable not enough to really turn loose to God and give your whole heart into him but enough yeah I go to church certainly I enjoy good singing and clapping hands yeah I love that are you listening I'm almost done almost almost done but when it comes right down to putting what you say you believe into practice and willing to confess the wrong they don't do it it just isn't there they don't have it well that's real conviction that's what we need we've left that a long time ago and swapped it what have we what have we left and swapped prayer and con con confession and conviction we've swapped it for emotion shaking jerking or jumping up and down it's true today because we've created an environment where people who have no respect for headship no desire for Holiness and unsanctified lives can Pat themselves on the back and feel good because they've got emotional shook jerk or jumped up and down and what have they swapped prayer confession conviction that's the reason it's holding tight they're holding tight because there's nothing there to hold them until you come upon the basis of God's word god sorrow ready to repent make everything right and do what's right ready to live like right I don't care what the people say or anything else you live for Jesus Christ and what he said then you take a church like that coming back there is a possibility of it coming but they're not willing to do iten sister Rebecca if you could come to the Piano Brothers to your instruments I want to close with this statement as we before we pray put yourself in Samson's shoes I don't know where balum will be in the final analysis he was a prophet who became a soothsayer and ultimately he rejects God Cain doesn't have very good standing Kora doesn't as we looked at money balum is type of that Samson tempted with women Saul the pride of life we know in Saul as we're going to get into that maybe Wednesday and Sunday there's a the prophet Saul seeks The Witch of indor that said maybe a lot about Saul but he has this sees Samuel and Samuel says you'll be with me and so there there is a Salvation for Saul so just because you're there's a Temptation in these things doesn't mean you're eternally lost and that's the beauty of I could say of Samson's testimony we've read a lot over the last few services on Samson but where he ends up in the end he kills more in death than he did in life and there was Redemption that's why brother says just once more he tells Life Tabernacle run for your life run for your life so there's a lesson in Samson that you've got to rec recogniz the possibility and be willing to follow no matter what it takes brother Brown makes this statement I just want to end on this and go to prayer he says You must die with your enemy you must die to the enemy that's got you in this condition L the flesh less the eyes and the pride of life money women or popularity whatever it might be you must die with it Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back on him again he saw what he was raised up to do not be a showman listen that's that's why these if there's any rebuke at all uh for any of us whether it be me as a pastor with my emphasis well he seems to be too intellectual or he seems to be anti- this or or he seems to be Pro this and anti whatever it might be here's your opportunity to recognize what you're called to do what you're called to be not a showman not emotional or intellectual but a servant to have himself so that the power of God could flow through him and there's our Redemption is when we could just say you know what I need to die to the enemy that's got me in this condition my the worst enemy the the big three the money women popularity Lusty eye lust of the flesh The Pride life I don't want them to entice me I don't want them to delude me I don't want them to seduce me I don't want to be bound I certainly don't want to be blind oh God I die to those things I don't want to be in it for show but I want to be in it f show I want to be in it all the way I want to be I want to be fully committed to the word of God a servant so this power can flow through me let us not be those that through our own complexes as I've studied this I realized especially with the example of Saul he was just a prisoner to his own perception of himself and how Pride worked in him in such a subtle way what we can find is through our complexes we build up all these complexes and all you're doing is you're boxing yourself in all you've done is you forced yourself into some image or some way or something that uh uh you've got to do and you're going to always be guilty because you're going to condemn yourself and you're going to measure Yourself by other people and other things and you're never going to quite match up to it so break the chains that binds you whether it be of the flesh or the eyes or the pride of life break the chains that bind you whether it be money or popularity or women let those chains dissolve in the power of God's word and just be who he called you to be it's a shame that you'd miss out on so much as an individual because you're trying to fit some other image for your life instead of the one that God has for you be what God called you to be the same would go for a family trying to keep up with the Joneses trying to match this and match that could you imagine telling somebody that you ate at some taco joint and just to keep up with you they go twice in one day what kind of life is that I'm just kidding brother Michael I know you did that but this a this this I kind of feel bad now he's going to think man is this his opportunity to finally get me you got to have someone you take it out on otherwise you hurt the innocent but there's so many things we could do as a family to drag people around and and try to make things work and fit in the best thing you could do is follow God for your life for your family do what's right in in your heart as you sincerely follow the lord and I trust that if you're sincere God will show up just like he has in times past and say that wasn't good but if you do well I'll bless it and you won't go in the way of Kane you say you corrected me thank you and I trust that we can always have that heart as spiritual Believers as members of this church and as we Embrace those who are part of what we say the message Community or the Christian Community around us that we always have the right heart not in the way of Cain not in bringing railing accusations but we keep our heart right amen and we don't do it for show cuz there are people that need God more than ever thirsty for it hungry for it and that's the reason why God put us here you say why are we still here cuz there's somebody out there that needs this that's part of it there's somebody in in whether it be in Prescot whether it be in Tucson or Maricopa County there's somebody that needs Christ and if all you present is the big three they've had all of that they want and that's not what they're after amen let's Stand Together
