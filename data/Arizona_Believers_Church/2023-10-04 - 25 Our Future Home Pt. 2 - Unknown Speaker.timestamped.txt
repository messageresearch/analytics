[0:00] I'd appreciate your help this evening as
[0:01] we Minister and continue on the subject
[0:04] of our future home and it's always such
[0:06] a wonderful privilege to be able to
[0:08] minister to you and I know you'll do a
[0:09] tremendous job in just getting behind me
[0:11] and kind of pushing me through this got
[0:13] a lot on my heart I like to share but a
[0:14] lot of it's review and maybe I overthink
[0:17] it a little bit uh in doing that that it
[0:19] might weary some but just if you could
[0:21] just stick with me here at the outset I
[0:23] want to cover a few things from Sunday
[0:24] morning and just go a step further in
[0:26] the um the subject of our future home
[0:29] again remember that we're looking at
[0:30] Redemption as a subject in this uh
[0:32] that's such a pervasive powerful subject
[0:35] throughout the entire scripture uh God's
[0:37] plan in the beginning was a Plan of
[0:38] Redemption and what's remarkable about
[0:41] that plan is he knew that through a
[0:43] process in Plan of Redemption he could
[0:44] display every single one of his
[0:45] attributes and so that's the reason why
[0:47] God has this process of redemption this
[0:50] Plan of Redemption in the scripture so
[0:52] that he can make himself known and he
[0:54] knowing all things uh in his great
[0:56] wisdom saw that through Redemption he
[0:58] could declare himself and so as we
[1:00] review some from Sunday going to pick up
[1:03] we're kind of right in the middle of the
[1:04] service on Sunday morning we mentioned
[1:05] how the in the sermon the future home of
[1:08] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:10] bride that brother B outlines God's Plan
[1:12] of Redemption for the bride and the
[1:15] world and he kind of runs them in
[1:16] parallel and he's he's showing how that
[1:19] what God does to the individual or what
[1:21] he's done for the bride to redeem us he
[1:23] is also going to do to the Earth and
[1:25] what we're wanting to express in that
[1:28] and I think kind of where we ended on
[1:29] Sunday and I want this to be very
[1:30] pronounced in your thoughts tonight is
[1:33] that when we look to the new Heaven and
[1:34] new earth in the end we see it's perfect
[1:37] absolutely perfect through God's process
[1:38] of redemption here it is in all its
[1:40] glory and Splendor and beauty and
[1:42] majesty and brother brandom is saying
[1:44] that's what God's going to do to the
[1:45] Earth and what he's saying is and that's
[1:47] what God has already done for you and so
[1:50] in that it's kind of a paradigm sh to go
[1:52] wait what huh oh and instead of us kind
[1:55] of putting things off way down the
[1:56] future in terms of what God's going to
[1:58] do we realize man there's something
[2:00] embodied in me and I'm manifesting
[2:02] something now as his bride that is the
[2:05] first revelation and the first Peak at
[2:07] what his future home is going to be like
[2:09] Revelations 21: 1-3 John says and I saw
[2:12] a new Heaven and a new Earth and the
[2:14] first Heaven and the first Earth were
[2:16] passed away there was no more sea so
[2:19] that process of the earth passing away
[2:24] uh brings forth a a new Heaven and new
[2:26] earth and there's no more sea and this
[2:28] is a renewed Earth this is a renovated
[2:31] Earth it's trans a transformed world the
[2:33] world was in a condition it goes through
[2:36] birth pains and it it's delivered as a
[2:38] changed Earth it's born a new and so our
[2:42] future home will be a redeemed world so
[2:47] when the Bible says new Heaven and new
[2:49] earth it's this is a redeemed heaven and
[2:51] a redeemed Earth as we read in second
[2:54] Peter chapter 3 it's saying that the
[2:56] it's telling us how this is going to
[2:58] happen this is what brother Brown kind
[2:59] of highlight in future home how that
[3:01] Peter tell John tells us it's new Peter
[3:04] tells us how he gets there and he's
[3:05] pointing to it's this fire baptism that
[3:08] changes it from one state to another and
[3:12] it's not all dissolved and completely
[3:14] disappears and God creates a new one but
[3:16] something through that transforming
[3:18] power renders it new renders it redeemed
[3:21] is how I think is a great way of looking
[3:23] at it so Peter is telling us how God
[3:26] achieves the new Heaven and a new Earth
[3:28] through that fiery baptism that
[3:30] dissolving of atmospheres and elements
[3:32] and everything that's made up of
[3:34] mankind sister Elizabeth and I were
[3:36] fellowshipping on it this week and is
[3:38] even there was just something and we're
[3:40] talking about I said even all those
[3:41] satellites and all those web telescopes
[3:43] have been launched out into the
[3:44] atmospheres something's got to catch up
[3:46] with it and dissolve it something's got
[3:49] to something's got to burn it all up and
[3:51] I even thought of what you sent me
[3:52] brother Lucas how the all the God just
[3:54] has to shift one planet and all a sudden
[3:56] things can start happening moving around
[3:58] and taking care of a lot of things out
[3:59] there uh to achieve this renovation and
[4:03] this renewal of the earth so now with
[4:05] the new Heaven and new earth and the
[4:08] first heaven and first Earth passed away
[4:11] that is to change from one state to
[4:13] another he says in in verse two and I
[4:15] saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming
[4:17] down from God out of Heaven prepared as
[4:20] a bride for a husband I I feel that you
[4:22] could preach endlessly on Revelations 21
[4:26] all these things that are being
[4:27] represented now New Jerusalem is
[4:28] represented as a then when he sees the
[4:30] bride she's represented the New
[4:31] Jerusalem so all these types and shadows
[4:34] and all these descriptions and
[4:35] everything you could preach on endlessly
[4:37] but this New Jerusalem is going to come
[4:39] down out of Heaven A as it's described
[4:42] as coming down out of Heaven I know that
[4:43] causes us to think in certain directions
[4:45] and projections but the Earth is going
[4:47] to break up and it's going to open up
[4:50] and things going to be changed and
[4:51] dissolved and it's going to be the New
[4:52] Jerusalem that comes and settles upon
[4:55] the
[4:56] Earth it's that new uh the new city
[5:00] and he says and I heard a great voice
[5:02] out of Heaven saying behold because this
[5:04] is the holy city settling On A Renewed
[5:06] Earth the Tabernacle of God is with men
[5:10] brother R talks about how now God is
[5:12] resident his residence now is
[5:14] permanently on Earth God is resonant
[5:16] with men and he will dwell with them and
[5:18] they shall be his people God himself
[5:20] shall be with them and be their God now
[5:22] if that sounds like a language he used
[5:24] of Israel if it sounds like a language
[5:25] he used of the Gentiles that's all true
[5:27] but now there's a permanence to it now
[5:30] there's not a natural uh the typing the
[5:33] spiritual now everything's just kind of
[5:34] Blends together and God is now
[5:36] permanently dwelling upon the face of
[5:38] the Earth in his Bri in his son and
[5:41] through his bride that this is the
[5:43] representation of God for all eternity
[5:45] there's no more dispensations there's no
[5:47] more coming of this there's no more
[5:48] changing of that there's no more sin
[5:49] there's no more sorrow there's no more
[5:51] Interruption there's no more Cycles the
[5:53] Tabernacle of God is not in a seventh
[5:56] Dimension he's way up there real high
[5:58] and we kind of pray to a god who's in
[6:00] heaven no now it is resonant with man
[6:03] where man is is where God is and it's
[6:04] all been fused together and this is that
[6:07] Eternal eighth day that we are Longing
[6:09] To Go to and so the Earth that we're
[6:12] living on now is going to be
[6:14] changed God will come and dwell in his
[6:16] son in his bride and manifest himself
[6:19] for eternity on this Earth that's our
[6:21] future home and I'm wanting that to have
[6:24] some impact some punch we think about it
[6:27] in the sermon things that are to be and
[6:28] I think this sermon here captures so
[6:30] much of this and uh my wife has been
[6:32] listening to the sermon birth pains it
[6:34] captured so captures so much of this and
[6:37] I do not think that heaven is a place
[6:39] that my mothers used to tell my mother
[6:40] used to tell me about I believe that the
[6:42] church has grown from that to think it
[6:44] used to be 100 years or two I think the
[6:46] oldtimers used to think that everyone
[6:47] that died went up to heaven had a heart
[6:49] and sat there on the clouds and played a
[6:51] heart well I wasn't raised in that time
[6:54] I do receiv receiving do remember seeing
[6:56] cartoons that when the cat or dog would
[6:57] die they'd Sprout Wings they'd play a
[6:59] harp and they they kind of float around
[7:00] in the cloud and so that that perhaps
[7:03] was a thought at one time having been
[7:05] raised in the message and having by
[7:06] God's grace believing parents I wasn't
[7:09] taught that kind of heaven but here
[7:10] brother brandom says that there was this
[7:12] time when that's just kind of what you
[7:13] thought heaven was were kind of spooky I
[7:15] think is how brother B talked about it
[7:17] how weird it would be he says now they
[7:19] knew that there was a place called
[7:20] heaven but if that be so all the
[7:22] musicians have it on us and the musician
[7:26] said all the heart players would have it
[7:29] on us we've even got one says but isn't
[7:31] that a kind of place it isn't that kind
[7:33] of place it isn't playing Harps at all
[7:36] and no offense to The Harp players he
[7:37] says I don't I believe don't believe the
[7:39] Bible teaches that but that was a
[7:41] conception I think this just has so much
[7:43] weight to it it was kind of drawing me
[7:45] off sides a little bit and I wanted to
[7:46] work out of Revelations 5 for a while he
[7:48] says but that was a conception that they
[7:50] had before the fullness of the word come
[7:52] into existence or the open of the Seven
[7:55] Seals so the open of the Seven Seals is
[7:58] the full word coming to an existence so
[8:00] now that full word being born in
[8:01] manifestation of the open of seals tells
[8:03] us it's a different dispensation that
[8:05] has been it's the fullness of the word
[8:09] says at the open of the seals that's
[8:10] promised to us in this age that we then
[8:13] understand so we had prior conceptions
[8:16] but now that the full word is made
[8:17] manifest it changes our prior
[8:19] conceptions and now that the seals are
[8:21] open we understand that heaven is not a
[8:23] place with clouds and harps he said I
[8:26] believe that heaven is a real place just
[8:28] the same as this is a real place for God
[8:30] started us in our spiritual growth in
[8:32] this place C catching kind of those
[8:35] building blocks and I believe that
[8:38] heaven is a place just as real as this
[8:41] where we don't set up there for eternity
[8:44] and just sit there on a cloud we don't
[8:46] just strum our heart for all the all
[8:48] from here
[8:49] ever for for all from here ever but
[8:52] we're going to a real place where we're
[8:55] going to do things I love the ambiguity
[8:57] of that we're going to go to a real
[8:59] place we're going to do
[9:01] things and he says where we're going to
[9:03] live and then gets a little bit more
[9:05] specific and I know some of us might
[9:06] cringe having left work in a hurry to
[9:08] get here he says we're going to
[9:10] work we're going to enjoy we're going to
[9:12] live we're going to life to real life to
[9:15] real eternal life we're going to a
[9:17] heaven of paradise now this is something
[9:20] when he says this that we're going to a
[9:22] place we're going to do things we're
[9:23] going to live we're going to work we're
[9:24] going to enjoy we're going to live we're
[9:25] going to have life eternal I believe
[9:27] what he's trying to get us to
[9:28] conceptualize is life here is a shadow
[9:30] of life is what life is going to be like
[9:32] over there that there are certain
[9:34] elements of this life that we don't like
[9:36] and there drudgery and there's things
[9:37] that are perverted and man wasn't meant
[9:38] to live that way but yet in the way that
[9:40] we're living now there's some shadow of
[9:42] the Eternal God when he made man in the
[9:44] very beginning he made him to till the
[9:46] soil he made man to have dominion over
[9:49] the Earth and name the animals and till
[9:50] the ground and rearrange things and have
[9:52] dominion So Adam had a job to do in the
[9:55] beginning he was working in the Garden
[9:57] of Eden but yet it wasn't a toil it
[9:58] wasn't a strain it's the curse of
[10:00] Genesis 3:19 that brought the strain and
[10:02] the toil on
[10:04] Adam and so we're going to a real place
[10:07] and he says much like this
[10:09] place and I realize that this concept of
[10:12] heaven and Eternity can be a real
[10:15] stubborn idea in our heads where it's
[10:17] just this this division of well we're
[10:19] living here and I don't want to go to
[10:21] hell I want to go to heaven and we've
[10:23] broken up into these three places you're
[10:25] living here now you're either going to
[10:26] go to hell you're going to go to heaven
[10:27] I know I keep repeating this but I want
[10:29] us to know that where we're living now
[10:30] though we may depart for a season we're
[10:33] coming back for a millennium and though
[10:34] we may depart for a season it's going to
[10:36] be completely renovated and we're coming
[10:38] right back to this earth we're going to
[10:40] live and reain here
[10:42] forever and he says just like Adam and
[10:44] Eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed
[10:46] in the Garden of Eden before sin came in
[10:48] we're on our road right back there again
[10:50] right right back that's
[10:52] Redemption what was represented in
[10:55] Creation in the beginning all these
[10:56] great seeds that were swn in Genesis
[10:58] what Adam and and the woman were
[10:59] portraying it was just a quick glimpse
[11:02] of what could be but God said knew that
[11:05] if they remained here in this Perfection
[11:07] forever I would always remain a mystery
[11:09] so they have to fall and there has to be
[11:11] a Plan of Redemption so that you can
[11:14] know fully who I am but I'm not going to
[11:16] abandon the image that I expressed in
[11:18] Genesis 1:2 I'll bring that back up
[11:21] again in redemption in its perfect
[11:23] picture remember it began with the
[11:25] garden it ends with the city and that
[11:27] city is representative of the full seeds
[11:30] of everything that was in that Garden
[11:31] manifest in its
[11:34] Perfection says we're going to come
[11:36] right back the first Adam through sin
[11:37] took us out the second Adam through
[11:39] righteousness brings us back in again
[11:41] justifies us and brings us back in so
[11:44] there's Redemption through Jesus
[11:47] Christ now brother bradam and brother
[11:49] John this is where I'm skipping a little
[11:50] bit to not this next quote from future
[11:53] home but after the Romans 8 the next
[11:55] scripture he says or the next quote God
[11:57] already took up his abode
[12:00] potentially as it said that the
[12:02] Tabernacle of God is with men God will
[12:04] be resonant with
[12:06] men time time is completely done away
[12:08] with so all that we exist in is a
[12:10] dimension of Eternity and God is
[12:13] dwelling there now with his redeemed
[12:15] creatures his redeemed creation and even
[12:18] those who participated in it uh at the
[12:21] Judgment of white throne and God is uh
[12:24] that's going to be his dwelling place
[12:26] then but he says God already took up his
[12:27] AB Bo potentially says the kingdom of
[12:29] God is in the earth now in the hearts of
[12:32] his Saints says it's his attributes that
[12:34] he began in the beginning so the kingdom
[12:37] the the future home is now already in
[12:40] his Saints God already took his AB Bo
[12:43] potentially in the earth now in his
[12:45] children in his bride it's his his bride
[12:47] is his attributes from the beginning now
[12:50] his attributes are
[12:51] redeemed what what is he waiting what's
[12:54] the hold up what's what is he waiting
[12:56] for to redeem the Earth so you are
[12:59] already your soul is already a redeemed
[13:01] attribute of God and the very thing that
[13:04] kind of the next stage in this he's
[13:06] looking at is the Redemption of the
[13:08] earth to set his attributes on it so why
[13:12] hasn't God just come and fully dwelt in
[13:14] the Earth all over the face of the Earth
[13:16] why hasn't the coming of the Lord
[13:18] happened like everybody thinks it's
[13:19] going to happen with a 900 foot Jesus
[13:20] and airplanes crashing and angels with
[13:22] their backos and picks and shovels
[13:24] opening up graves because that's not the
[13:26] way God does it he won't step foot on
[13:29] the earth is in that Corporal body of
[13:31] Jesus Christ that physical body he had
[13:33] in the days of his first coming until
[13:34] the Millennium and that's his third
[13:36] coming and that's the one most people
[13:37] are looking for and that's why they miss
[13:39] his revealing in this hour so he says
[13:42] that his attributes will be redeemed why
[13:44] is he waiting what's the hold up of him
[13:46] taking his full Abode to redeem the
[13:48] Earth to set his attributes on it to
[13:50] fill exactly his predestinated plan so
[13:54] there has to be a process wherein God
[13:57] renovates the Earth so that he can set
[13:59] his full attributes on it to fulfill his
[14:02] predestinated plan so brother B this is
[14:04] a statement I think is so critical says
[14:06] now compare what we see with our own
[14:09] eyes what God has done to redeem his
[14:11] world compare what we've seen with our
[14:13] own eyes and what God does to redeem his
[14:16] world he's done the same plan to redeem
[14:19] his
[14:20] people now what what are those eyes
[14:22] we're talking about look at what he's
[14:23] done for
[14:24] you look what he's done for you look
[14:27] compare what we see with their own eyes
[14:29] I I'm using it that way if it doesn't
[14:30] strike you that way I'm using it that
[14:32] way look what he's done for you the plan
[14:34] he does to redeem his people he's going
[14:36] to do to redeem his world to me this is
[14:39] a crucial point that we got to catch
[14:41] this parallel what he does to redeem the
[14:43] person the individual his bride is what
[14:45] he does to redeem the world look at what
[14:47] he's done for
[14:49] you Romans chapter 8:
[14:52] 19-22 we read this before he says for
[14:55] the earnest expectation of the creature
[14:57] think of creation
[14:59] Heaven and Earth all that has created as
[15:02] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[15:04] sons of God for the creature Heaven and
[15:07] Earth cre all the creation animal life
[15:09] all animal kingdoms and plant life were
[15:12] made subject to vanity not of their own
[15:14] accord not willingly but by reason of
[15:16] him who have subjected the same in hope
[15:19] God having allowed the bondage in hope
[15:21] that what because the creature itself
[15:24] shall also be
[15:26] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[15:30] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[15:31] children of God I I think that's a heavy
[15:35] phrase that's a that's real uh you might
[15:38] only be able to deadlift that
[15:39] spiritually it's so heavy he says he
[15:41] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[15:43] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[15:46] the children of God he says for we know
[15:48] that the whole creation granth and
[15:50] travaileth in pain together until now
[15:54] what are they growing in travailing for
[15:55] what are they in birth pains for what
[15:57] are they what are they what are are they
[15:58] longing for to be released from their
[16:01] bondage he says to be delivered from the
[16:04] bondage of corruption and so when Peter
[16:07] writes that the Heaven and Earth are
[16:10] going to be fire shall dissolve the the
[16:13] Heaven and the Earth that dissolving is
[16:15] loosed in the New Testament it's loosed
[16:17] in the Greek so the Earth is going to be
[16:21] loosed fire is going to loose it from
[16:23] the bands that bind it fire is going to
[16:25] destroy the man-made ideas of the
[16:27] spirits and everything that's
[16:29] contaminated it's going to be loosed
[16:32] from the bondage of corruption going to
[16:34] be delivered from the bondage of
[16:36] corruption the fire baptism that's going
[16:38] to come upon the Heaven and the Earth is
[16:40] going to dissolve everything that holds
[16:42] it into bondage and when it's loosed
[16:44] from that it's going to be set
[16:45] completely
[16:47] free and it's groaning for that it's
[16:49] travailing for
[16:51] that now as we think about this that
[16:54] what the God is going to do to the Earth
[16:56] and loose it from
[16:57] bondage the Earth is going to be
[16:59] delivered from bondage it says the
[17:01] bondage of corruption into
[17:05] Liberty now the plan what we see with
[17:08] our own eyes God has done to redeem his
[17:11] world he's done the same plan to redeem
[17:13] his people so if the Earth is going to
[17:15] by fire baptism be loosed from the
[17:17] bondage of corruption be loosed from H
[17:22] all slavery and all corruption then we
[17:26] likewise have been loosed amen we've
[17:29] been
[17:30] delivered now Galatians chap 5
[17:35] verse1 Paul writes this he says Stand
[17:38] Fast therefore in the
[17:40] Liberty where with Christ hath made us
[17:43] free amen remember the language he hath
[17:46] made us Kings and Priests hath passed
[17:49] from death into life let's Stand Fast be
[17:52] secure uh be be sure be
[17:56] certain and and and no
[17:59] no that the
[18:01] Liberty this loosening this
[18:05] Freedom this you're no longer under the
[18:08] Dominion and the power and control of
[18:09] certain things where with Christ hath
[18:12] made us free he says and be not
[18:14] entangled again with the Yoke of
[18:17] bondage this is this is a language that
[18:20] would just cause a a Hebrew to
[18:23] LEAP as it would as it would hearken
[18:26] them back to the law of redemption
[18:28] Leviticus 25 and he's saying as if
[18:31] anyone had been sold if anyone had lost
[18:33] their possessions if anyone had become a
[18:36] slave they would know there's some time
[18:38] period that they'd have to be the in the
[18:40] servitude and there'd be some time they
[18:42] weren't their own person but there would
[18:44] come a time when they would be loosed
[18:46] from that and so he's using a language
[18:48] of redemption and he said that there's a
[18:51] once you've been made free don't make
[18:53] the choice to go
[18:55] back and have your ear boor through and
[18:58] and say I'm going to be an indentured
[18:59] servant all my life I'm going to refuse
[19:01] the opportunity of Liberty I'm going to
[19:03] refuse the opportunity of the Jubilee
[19:05] I'm going to refuse the opportunity to
[19:07] Redemption I want to remain here A Slave
[19:09] he's saying if Christ has made you free
[19:12] then you are free he said therefore
[19:14] stand in this Liberty don't languish in
[19:17] it don't just survive but thrive in this
[19:20] Liberty whereas Christ has made us free
[19:22] you have been made free I just feel the
[19:26] services that brother Matthew preached
[19:27] just fit so perfectly with this even
[19:30] though I haven't even finished them I'm
[19:31] just about done with the first one and
[19:33] there's a theme of redemption and if God
[19:35] before us who can be against us and we
[19:37] ought to realize that and step into that
[19:39] and embrace that and know that God's not
[19:41] going to quit or give up and maybe we're
[19:43] just kind of languishing we're being
[19:44] lazy and God saying stand up in this
[19:48] Liberty because Christ hath made us free
[19:54] right if something has sounded and we've
[19:56] been
[19:57] delivered these prior conceptions but
[19:59] now the full word's been Bor into
[20:00] manifestation don't go back to that
[20:04] vomit so he said be not in Tangled again
[20:06] with the Yoke of bondage that that's
[20:09] quite a quite a statement I guess the
[20:12] kind of the word picture I see now is
[20:14] Christ has made you free the shackles
[20:16] are off of you and now he's want you to
[20:18] enjoy your Liberty and you just go back
[20:21] and you say I never never
[20:23] mind I'm going to just go ahead and put
[20:25] the Yoke
[20:26] on and you do it yourself
[20:30] now Leviticus
[20:32] 25:
[20:34] 8-13 I I just want to read through this
[20:36] because I think this will just uh stir
[20:38] up a lot that's in your
[20:40] hearts and thou shalt number seven
[20:42] sabbaths of years unto thee seven time
[20:45] seven years this is the law of
[20:48] redemption if one has been bought or
[20:51] sold into
[20:52] slavery if one has been
[20:54] found uh to be you to have
[20:58] lost their their Liberty their freedom
[21:01] says in the space of seven Sabbath shall
[21:03] be unto thee 49 409 years verse n then
[21:07] shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[21:09] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[21:12] seventh month in the day of atonement
[21:15] shall you make the trumpet sound
[21:17] throughout all your
[21:19] land just think of what
[21:22] this uh just how beautiful this Year of
[21:25] Jubilee
[21:26] is and ye shall Hollow the 50th
[21:29] year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all
[21:33] the land unto all the inhabitants
[21:35] thereof so the trumpet calls them to an
[21:40] the the Feast of atonement in the 50th
[21:42] year and it proclaims a
[21:44] jubilee and and and we know that the
[21:47] message of the hour calls us to the
[21:48] genuine atonement back to Christ the
[21:50] word so there's this parallel there we
[21:52] see even in the day of Pentecost to the
[21:54] to the Jews on the day of Pentecost uh
[21:56] uh that that there is a
[21:58] that God established his kingdom in the
[22:00] flesh in in on the earth and his people
[22:03] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:04] and so there's all these different types
[22:06] and shadows that we see now in this end
[22:08] time God through the the the message of
[22:11] the hour there's a trumpet call us back
[22:13] to the Feast of
[22:16] atonement and he says that it shall be a
[22:18] jubilee unto thee and you shall return
[22:21] every man unto his
[22:23] possession and you shall return every
[22:25] man unto his family that's Redemption if
[22:28] any man's lost his possession give it
[22:30] back to him if any man's lost his Strang
[22:33] from his family separated from his
[22:34] family give it back to him let us sink
[22:37] in a little bit this is the Jubilee this
[22:39] is the year of redemption there's going
[22:41] to be a proclamation in this 50th year
[22:43] this year of Jubilee throughout all the
[22:44] land and all the inhabitants thereof it
[22:46] shall be a jubilee and return to every
[22:49] man his possession he lost give him back
[22:52] what he lost through his own uh his own
[22:54] unfaithfulness through his own gambling
[22:56] through his own insecurities and
[22:58] insufficiencies however he lost it it
[23:00] doesn't matter give it back to
[23:02] him if any man lose his family return
[23:05] that man to his family not as a servant
[23:07] but back as he was and a jubilee that a
[23:11] jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you
[23:14] and you shall not sow neither reap that
[23:16] which groweth of itself in it nor gather
[23:19] the grapes in it of thy Vine
[23:21] undressed what a type of the curse being
[23:25] lifted of Genesis
[23:26] 3:19
[23:28] it the curse isn't lifted but yet he
[23:30] wants to represent something in this
[23:31] 50th year to show that this is
[23:33] signifying in representing man's
[23:35] ultimate Jubilee that the the the
[23:38] evidence of sin in the beginning is now
[23:41] in an earth that we have to dress and we
[23:43] have to keep and we have to fight with
[23:44] it not as Adam was attended to in the
[23:46] beginning but now wrestling and toy with
[23:48] it and now he says you know what don't
[23:49] gather don't sew don't reap uh that goth
[23:52] of it in itself nor gather the grapes
[23:54] that are undressed he says just you take
[23:56] that break as a sign of what this rest
[23:59] is freedom and liberty from this curse
[24:02] for it is the
[24:03] Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you
[24:06] shall eat the increase thereof out of
[24:08] the field in the year of this Jubilee
[24:10] you shall return every man unto his
[24:17] possession that's
[24:19] Redemption this is the law of redemption
[24:21] that God put in the Old Testament so
[24:22] that we could draw from this this is
[24:24] God's mind this is God's attitude this
[24:26] is how God feels about something that is
[24:28] originally possessed and then lost God
[24:30] hates it when we lose
[24:33] something right there's there's
[24:35] something too we I maybe I'll just speak
[24:38] for myself and maybe Lord I apologize if
[24:40] I put something in your I hate it when I
[24:42] lose something and you want to trip my
[24:44] whole week up just have me lose
[24:46] something CU I won't go back to whatever
[24:48] it is I was planning until I find it
[24:50] because I don't believe in Black Magic
[24:53] and I believe that if something is it
[24:54] was somewhere at one time then it's
[24:56] still somewhere at at another time you
[24:58] just got to find where that is and I'm
[25:00] finding the older I get the better Hider
[25:02] I've
[25:03] become and I've hid things in really
[25:05] really good places and I'm waiting for
[25:06] the revelation of where I hit it so I
[25:09] can find it but I hate to lose something
[25:12] and there's something about in the
[25:13] nature of God that if something was his
[25:15] and he loses it God says uhuh not for
[25:18] everybody I'm not going to lose one
[25:20] thing my words will not return to me
[25:21] void if I possess something if something
[25:24] was mine I'll never let it go I'll never
[25:27] give it up even if it runs away from me
[25:29] even if it turns its back on me if it's
[25:31] mine I'm getting it back and that's the
[25:34] that's what Redemption means God would
[25:37] not be satisfied of having you and then
[25:40] you being lost and just making a new you
[25:42] as a replacement he wants you back
[25:46] that's what Redemption is Redemption is
[25:48] not replacement Redemption is to bring
[25:50] back what was
[25:52] lost
[25:55] Hallelujah God wants to bring what was
[25:57] was lost back this speaks the scripture
[26:00] saying this is my heart this is my
[26:02] attitude this is what I'm going to
[26:04] do I love it God's so intent on
[26:07] Redemption that we could say we haven't
[26:09] lost a hair on our head
[26:12] Glory right there's certain things we
[26:14] just real I I haven't lost anything I
[26:16] haven't already gained there I hope that
[26:19] doesn't do have anything to do with
[26:22] weight but it's a it's the principle of
[26:24] redemption as we read in Leviticus 25
[26:27] and
[26:28] you're all well versed in this through
[26:29] excellent teaching through the years and
[26:32] then the message of the hour just places
[26:33] it so beautifully this is the perfect
[26:35] type of redemption of the Soul this law
[26:38] of redemption this Jubilee we find that
[26:40] we've been loosed from the bondage of
[26:42] sin that as we've already read that
[26:44] Christ has loosed us he has set us free
[26:49] as the first Adam took us out the second
[26:51] Adam brings us back in and so this is be
[26:55] we're freed from sin and the bondage
[26:58] that comes with it and the punishment
[26:59] that's associated with it we're free
[27:01] you've passed already from death into
[27:03] life you can't come into judgment you
[27:04] can't be judged You' already been
[27:06] delivered in the Year of Jubilee someone
[27:08] couldn't reach past that and say no you
[27:09] owe me say butd he's
[27:11] free and the only way that we could go
[27:14] back to the bondage of before is if we
[27:15] choose
[27:17] to I think that tells us the power we
[27:20] have now is redeemed Sons and Daughters
[27:21] of God to put ourselves in
[27:25] bondage now as Paul is writing this in
[27:27] Galatians 5 there's just so much that
[27:29] you can gather from these other places
[27:31] around it he if I can put it this way
[27:33] he's admonishing the galatian church the
[27:36] Believers to operate the Liberty The
[27:39] Authority that's been granted them in
[27:41] Christ Jesus that say Stand Fast in
[27:44] Liberty why would you being made free go
[27:46] back to something that's bondage why
[27:49] would you being delivered ever want to
[27:51] go back to be in the state of being
[27:53] bound down and he's telling them now you
[27:56] stand fast in the Liberty where in
[27:58] Christ hath made us free don't tangle
[28:01] yourself up again don't be yolked up
[28:03] again don't be bowed down again in these
[28:05] other things and remember this has been
[28:07] repetition Paul believed that the
[28:09] kingdom of God was not in eternity in
[28:12] some other atmosphere in The Ether
[28:14] somewhere but he believed that the
[28:16] kingdom was going to be on
[28:18] earth the kingdom would be established
[28:20] on Earth it' be a messiah Reign on Earth
[28:23] Paul looked around in in Israel and he
[28:25] saw the dimensions of the Promised Land
[28:27] he saw the priesthood he saw the people
[28:29] he saw the flesh he saw the history he
[28:31] knew this is something God's going to
[28:33] redeem one day the Kingdom's going to be
[28:35] here on Earth to a Hebrew it wasn't a
[28:37] place he was going to listen this is
[28:39] this has been something that started
[28:41] this thought in my heart in the very
[28:42] beginning to a Jew a church wasn't a
[28:45] place they went a religion wasn't
[28:46] something they practiced it was who they
[28:48] were we call ourselves uh zoners is that
[28:52] what we call ourselves in Arizona zoners
[28:54] or maybe Texans or whatever we might be
[28:56] call ourselves and we have this identity
[28:58] these states that we belong to and we
[29:01] call ourselves Americans and we identify
[29:03] with this we identify with all sorts of
[29:04] things carnivores vegans you name it we
[29:07] have all sorts of ideas and then there's
[29:09] kind of this other part that kind of mix
[29:10] into it to say well I'm also a
[29:12] Christian right and Christianity is just
[29:14] a part of it but to a Jew there was no
[29:18] separation of their religion from their
[29:21] daily life there was no separation of
[29:24] their religion from their nationality
[29:26] from their identity
[29:28] so their their religion was practiced
[29:30] daily it was who they were so when Paul
[29:33] thinks about a kingdom he's not thinking
[29:36] of oh I'll just go to church one day
[29:39] like we think well I go to church on
[29:40] Wednesday I go to church on Sunday it's
[29:42] just kind of this check the box thing
[29:44] when it comes to religion oh one day
[29:45] we're going to go to heaven one day
[29:47] we're going to go to Heaven till Paul is
[29:48] like no the kingdom is heaven on Earth
[29:51] the kingdom is to be established on
[29:53] Earth so Paul he believed the kingdom
[29:55] was not going to be in heaven but it
[29:57] would be on earth therefore let it be in
[30:00] Earth if it's going to be on earth then
[30:03] let it be in
[30:06] Earth so Christ had made him free from
[30:09] the Dominion of sin the World the Flesh
[30:10] the devil and he's saiding don't go back
[30:13] and be entangled again with sin the
[30:14] World the Flesh the devil don't do it
[30:17] likewise we also having been made free
[30:19] from the law of sin and death having
[30:21] been made free by Christ let's stand in
[30:23] the liberty and don't be entangled again
[30:25] with the Yoke of bondage
[30:27] so he says in Galatians 4: 8-9 how be it
[30:31] then when you knew not God you did
[30:33] service unto them which by Nature are no
[30:40] Gods there's no power in those
[30:43] things there's no there's no deity
[30:45] there's no lordship there's no Dominion
[30:47] but now after the have known God and I
[30:49] love this or rather are known of God
[30:53] what does it bring us back to
[30:54] predestination brings us back to God's
[30:56] thoughts in the beginning beginning how
[30:58] turn you again to the weak and beggarly
[31:00] elements wherein you desire again to be
[31:03] in
[31:04] bondage why would we ever want to go
[31:06] back and be in bondage to the weak and
[31:08] beggarly
[31:09] elements I know it's worthy of a lot
[31:11] more attention than maybe we're going to
[31:12] give it in these few moments but Paul is
[31:15] pointing to the believer's position in
[31:17] Christ right now where you've been made
[31:20] free from weak and beggarly elements
[31:23] you've been made free from so many
[31:25] things this is the Kingdom on Earth
[31:27] right now we've been set
[31:31] free that's the condition of our
[31:34] soul from that control tower down in our
[31:36] souls you've got something greater than
[31:38] everything else greater is he that is in
[31:40] you than he that is in the world it's
[31:42] something
[31:45] greater now in the sermon the future
[31:47] home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[31:49] Earthly
[31:50] bride he says this is kind of a lengthy
[31:53] statement here but I want to I want to
[31:54] read this so you can continue to see
[31:56] this parallel
[31:58] maybe I can button that up a little bit
[32:00] the Earth is one day going to be
[32:01] delivered Romans 8 tells us it's going
[32:04] to be delivered uh second Peter 3 the
[32:07] bands that hold it back going to be
[32:09] dissolved and we've been delivered we're
[32:12] no longer under the yal bondage that
[32:13] Liberty has been granted to us through
[32:15] the new birth now brother Bram
[32:18] describing so many different parts here
[32:21] he says look them hands designed this
[32:23] for his beloved bride designs in
[32:26] tenderly love for his bride he gets into
[32:27] this and things that are to be just
[32:29] think of how that God has even designed
[32:31] this Earth and how his hands designed
[32:33] this for his beloved bride designs and
[32:35] Tenderly love for his bride remember
[32:37] that the Holy Ghost descended on Jesus
[32:39] which Jesus was a part of the earth why
[32:41] the germ of God the life of God was
[32:43] designed in the womb of a woman which
[32:46] was the earth think of this
[32:48] type all all right and then the life of
[32:52] God came in so he was the beginning of
[32:55] the creation of God and now brother
[32:58] brandom several places where he talks
[33:00] about this but when when the Holy Ghost
[33:02] came down on the Jordan River and
[33:05] indwelled God came to dwell in his son
[33:07] he said Heaven and Earth embraced Heaven
[33:09] and Earth kissed there's that there's
[33:12] that type we get to see Between Heaven
[33:13] and Earth coming up quite a bit so
[33:15] here's that embracing in Christ he see
[33:18] there's some Affinity from the earth The
[33:19] Germ of God he's B he's shaped in the
[33:21] womb of a a virgin these things are
[33:23] elements that are formed he represents
[33:25] mankind he's the Kinsman even of
[33:27] Leviticus 25 he's the Kinsman and now
[33:30] the father comes to dwell in him he's
[33:32] the beginning of the creation of God
[33:34] it's his blood is divine says and then
[33:36] that blood of God that there was that by
[33:38] that germ when it was shed at Calvary
[33:40] dropped back on the earth what for to
[33:43] redeem the Earth talks about water that
[33:45] overflows it sanctifies or um justifies
[33:48] it type of the water baptism now even
[33:51] the blood this isn't typed the blood
[33:53] coming on the earth it it bathed it to
[33:55] redeem the earth now it's been just
[33:56] Justified it's been Sanctified and
[33:58] claimed now it's to receive its baptism
[34:01] of fire and be cleansed for Jesus and
[34:03] his bride notice how he's pointing to
[34:05] the process of what God does to the
[34:07] Earth he's done it for us now the
[34:10] process of a new birth is not to be we
[34:12] cannot make it
[34:13] Catholicism to where now we kind of
[34:15] break it out into stations and so you
[34:18] come and you visit the confessional
[34:19] brother Aaron has been four weeks since
[34:20] my last confession these are my sins and
[34:22] I say well what you need to do is you
[34:24] need to go burn a candle and visit the
[34:26] the repentance station and then you need
[34:28] to go like do this and you the the
[34:30] justification sanctification and baptism
[34:32] the Holy Ghost were never meant to be
[34:34] stations where we genu flect before it
[34:36] and we kind of we have to come through
[34:37] and check these boxes it's just a type
[34:39] to show the process whereby a person's
[34:42] renovated and changed the process of
[34:44] redemption justification sanctification
[34:46] baptism Holy Ghost God can do like
[34:49] that amen and sometimes we try too hard
[34:52] to force Our Lives into well I believe
[34:54] from 2010 to 2013 and a and a half I was
[34:57] justified and then from 2013 and a half
[35:00] until 2019 I was Sanctified and thank
[35:04] God for Co right I got the Holy Ghost
[35:07] and we just try so hard to make things
[35:09] fit into these boxes that's where a lot
[35:12] of ideas come from people trying to make
[35:14] sense of their experience when they were
[35:15] in denominations they go well I must
[35:17] have had it this way I must had hey just
[35:19] accept the fact that when you came to
[35:21] this word you got your new birth of
[35:22] Malachi 4 just accept that that's when
[35:25] the Holy Ghost sealed you into the
[35:26] kingdom of God when you had that baptism
[35:28] of Holy Ghost experience that's the new
[35:30] birth I don't need to try to figure out
[35:32] what day it was I just want to know that
[35:34] it
[35:35] [Applause]
[35:37] is and sometimes it's where we get hung
[35:39] up trying to turn it into these little
[35:40] blocks and stations but he show us that
[35:43] there's this process the Earth Justified
[35:44] the Earth Sanctified he says now it's
[35:46] got to receive its baptism of fire to be
[35:48] cleansed and then I catch this
[35:50] paralleling even with Christ and you you
[35:54] are these other parts that's drawn out
[35:56] of the this Earth You
[35:59] are
[36:01] now maybe this can help some of us if
[36:03] we're struggling with the idea that well
[36:05] I know I'm going to be forever but it's
[36:07] hard for me to understand how this Earth
[36:08] is going to be forever and he says well
[36:09] you came from it it's a packaged deal
[36:13] think of this he
[36:15] says your soul he says the Earth you're
[36:18] are a part of the earth your body your
[36:20] body is a part of the earth your soul is
[36:22] a part of God an attribute of God
[36:24] displayed here on Earth in a body
[36:27] the soul is redeemed right this is me
[36:29] speaking now to those who are getting
[36:30] out on the podcast the soul is
[36:33] redeemed that Soul has been redeemed
[36:36] through the process of the new birth now
[36:38] he says the body is to be redeemed
[36:41] there's Redemption for our body what
[36:44] what would it mean if he redeemed our
[36:45] soul and our Spirits were
[36:47] crazy what good would it do us what
[36:49] where are you then if your soul survives
[36:51] and your spirit doesn't go with you
[36:53] there's some things to chew on at least
[36:55] so the Redemption is complet complete
[36:57] there's Redemption for the soul there's
[36:59] Redemption for the mind the spirit
[37:00] there's Redemption for the body that's
[37:02] complete Redemption that's perfect
[37:04] Redemption so he's saying that the
[37:05] body's to be redeemed now the soul is
[37:10] redeemed because it was in sin so God
[37:13] came down by by a process of
[37:15] justification sanctification baptism of
[37:18] the Holy Ghost and redeemed your
[37:20] soul and you being part of the earth
[37:24] it's Redeemed by it you're in the
[37:27] process now oh man what kind of
[37:30] Goosebumps and shivers Shivers up the
[37:32] spine is the earth going to get when
[37:33] your body
[37:35] changes I got mine coming right they
[37:38] know their day is coming when your body
[37:40] changes it's a witness to them that
[37:42] their change is
[37:43] coming amen God came down in this
[37:47] process he said your body it's grow it
[37:50] on now notice this parallel this to me
[37:52] is well you know just just as my habit
[37:56] is wait till 8:07 on a Wednesday night
[37:58] to talk about something like this but
[38:00] the Earth he says your Soul's redeemed
[38:02] but now he's kind of talking about your
[38:03] body and he says your body's part of the
[38:05] earth and it's Redeemed by it and he say
[38:08] it's talking about the process of the
[38:09] earth he says you're in the process now
[38:10] it's growing up your body was justified
[38:12] under Noah's
[38:15] baptism and your flesh when it dropped
[38:17] upon
[38:18] here and your flesh when it dropped upon
[38:21] there that's the
[38:23] blood and the Earth is to be cleansed by
[38:25] fire
[38:27] the place where you will live with the
[38:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost a dwelling
[38:31] place for Christ's bride the New
[38:33] Jerusalem think about what he's saying
[38:35] he's he's bringing all these different
[38:37] thoughts together but I want you to be
[38:39] able to kind of if you could bring that
[38:42] together and realize that what's going
[38:44] to happen to the Earth my soul has
[38:46] already gone through that process but
[38:47] the body too that's when he talks about
[38:50] the the three-fold process and he goes
[38:52] Luther Wesley Pentecost and the Rapture
[38:55] now you tell tell me where are we living
[38:58] we're not just living in Pentecost the
[39:00] Pentecost has been that the believer in
[39:02] every age we're in the bright age the
[39:05] age of the change the age of the Rapture
[39:07] the age of the Redemption of this
[39:11] body this is he says you're in the
[39:14] process now and now he kind of Skips
[39:16] that we know this his body has got to be
[39:18] changed this body has got to be changed
[39:21] he says the Earth is to be cleansed by
[39:22] fire to make a place where you'll live
[39:24] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a
[39:26] dwelling place for Christ and his bride
[39:28] the New Jerusalem that's the Earth
[39:31] that's coming the new Heaven A New Earth
[39:33] and brother Bram says the world could
[39:36] not go right on after the Millennium
[39:38] without being
[39:40] changed to have such a place in it it'll
[39:43] have to be changed to have a new Heaven
[39:45] the to have the New Jerusalem be able to
[39:48] make its appearance on Earth this Earth
[39:50] has to change just like you had to
[39:53] change right just like we must be
[39:57] changed by his holy fire is what he says
[39:59] to condition and make a place for him to
[40:01] be contained within us that is the Holy
[40:03] Ghost so just as much as the Holy Ghost
[40:06] had to change our soul for him to find a
[40:08] place to dwell and to live in us the
[40:11] world has got to be
[40:14] changed to have such a place in it it'll
[40:17] have to be changed our soul has been
[40:18] changed our soul has been redeemed and
[40:21] this body is the next thing to be
[40:23] changed amen so many scriptures in types
[40:26] we could bring through this but God has
[40:28] a predestinated
[40:30] plan of redemption for our soul and for
[40:33] our
[40:34] body and his brother B says your Soul's
[40:37] a part of God and your body is a part of
[40:38] the
[40:40] earth and and so let's just leave it
[40:43] there your soul is a part of God and I
[40:44] think that's just easy we just accept
[40:46] that now your body is a part of the
[40:48] earth now that's where we kind of get
[40:50] might get hung up a little bit because
[40:52] we know how sticky this flesh has been
[40:54] we know all the things it's experienced
[40:56] the memory it has people say well you
[40:58] know you feel like you're Justified you
[41:00] never did it in the first place if we
[41:02] could get Zuckerberg just to delete our
[41:03] Facebook profile permanently or Google
[41:05] could just kind of scrub clean the
[41:07] history of our Instagram and everything
[41:08] else we'd feel pretty good about
[41:09] ourselves or better about ourselves but
[41:11] we know there's just kind of this record
[41:14] but you realize when the earth is burned
[41:15] up there's there's not going to be a
[41:18] record there's there's not going to be a
[41:20] a record of these
[41:22] things there going to be some
[41:24] hieroglyphics on a wall or some feti on
[41:27] a railroad car say oh gangster Mac yeah
[41:30] I remember him he was the
[41:36] man and recognize this from the the the
[41:40] Redemption I I'm going to try to do
[41:42] this uh uh in transition here well maybe
[41:46] I can stop maybe I could just cut it
[41:47] short but I want to get to this part at
[41:49] least Leviticus 25: 23 and
[41:52] 24 the land shall not be sold sold
[41:57] forever for the land is mine this is God
[42:00] speaking this is Moses speaking this is
[42:03] the high priest speaking this isn't
[42:05] Gangsta ma speaking this is God saying
[42:10] the land you may sell it you may give it
[42:12] up you may play Folly with it and you
[42:16] may sell it to somebody through the
[42:17] process of marriage it may come into the
[42:20] hands of of a of a heathen a gentile may
[42:22] take possession whatever it might be it
[42:24] might be sold but I won't let it be sold
[42:28] forever it might be contaminated but I
[42:30] won't let it be contaminated forever it
[42:32] might be possessed but I won't let it be
[42:34] possessed forever for the land is mine
[42:38] he says for years are strangers and
[42:39] Souljers with me notice the language he
[42:41] uses with Israel even he's saying look
[42:43] it's mine you're dwelling in
[42:46] it and in all the land of your
[42:49] possession you shall Grant a Redemption
[42:53] for the land this is part part of the
[42:56] law of redemption the land could be
[42:58] leased for a season the land could be
[43:00] harvested by someone else for a season
[43:02] someone could lose their land and their
[43:03] possession so it's go lost it's gone
[43:06] they've been running R running rough
[43:08] shot on it they've been tearing it up
[43:09] they've been letting rocks grow in it be
[43:11] thrown in it they've been letting weeds
[43:12] growing It Whatever might happen to it
[43:14] oh it's just chaos it's just confusion
[43:16] all the nonsense and Corruption they
[43:18] built a bar there they put the tattoo
[43:20] parlers there they've been running
[43:21] gambling onto all my lot my field is a
[43:23] complete chaos it's a complete mess God
[43:26] says it won't be sold forever no sir not
[43:29] forever the land is mine and you've got
[43:32] to Grant in your land all the land of
[43:35] your possession Grant a Redemption for
[43:39] the land in other words that land if it
[43:41] was yours it's got to come back to
[43:44] [Music]
[43:46] yours now this is if there's going to be
[43:50] Redemption then for God's people there's
[43:53] Redemption for the Earth as it says in
[43:55] those earlier verses of chapter 25 if
[43:58] there's Redemption for the man and the
[44:00] man can come back to his family if
[44:02] there's Redemption for possession and
[44:04] The Possession has to come back to the
[44:05] man he's saiding the land's got to come
[44:07] back
[44:09] too there's Redemption not only for your
[44:11] soul but there's Redemption for the
[44:13] Earth and if there's Redemption for the
[44:15] Earth there's Redemption for your body
[44:17] you know what I don't care how you try
[44:19] to get it chicken come first the chicken
[44:20] or the egg whatever it is if it's for
[44:22] the body because the Earth or the Earth
[44:24] because the body there's Redemption for
[44:27] the Earth is going to be redeemed my
[44:29] body's going to be redeemed or my body's
[44:30] going to be redeemed so the Earth has to
[44:31] be redeemed it doesn't matter to me all
[44:33] I knows it's going to be redeemed
[44:35] because of the law of
[44:39] redemption now you can back into this
[44:42] God created the Earth for a purpose to
[44:44] get a bride out of it so she's always
[44:47] connected with the
[44:48] Earth our bodies he says here came from
[44:51] the earth God was laying out his
[44:53] material when he created all that you
[44:55] ever would make up your body was there
[44:57] in the earth so certainly there's a
[44:59] Redemption of that Earth and therefore
[45:02] there's a Redemption for your body or
[45:04] there's a Redemption for your body
[45:06] therefore there's a Redemption for the
[45:07] Earth why it is again that part of that
[45:09] Eternal attribute of
[45:12] God Psalms 241 and2 says the Earth is
[45:15] the Lords and the fullness thereof the
[45:18] world and they that dwell therein for he
[45:21] hath founded it upon the Seas and
[45:24] established it upon
[45:26] the
[45:28] floods the land shall not be sold
[45:36] forever if you can think about it maybe
[45:39] we'll pick up this on this at a later
[45:40] time musicians if you'd
[45:44] come this
[45:47] is the reason
[45:51] why I got to express
[45:54] this you are Eternal and the Earth is
[45:57] eternal and that's part of
[45:59] redemption because there's Redemption
[46:01] because there was Redemption for the
[46:02] soul in Leviticus 25 there's Redemption
[46:05] for the land what good would it be for
[46:07] me to be a free man and have no land
[46:10] what good would it be for me to have
[46:11] possessions and have no place to build
[46:12] them and plant them and put them so they
[46:14] they they came together in the process
[46:16] of redemption it was this law that spoke
[46:18] of redemption and because you're
[46:20] redeemed the Earth is going to be
[46:23] redeemed now if we get into it or not I
[46:26] I've been putting this off for 24 parts
[46:28] now but because you're redeemed the
[46:30] Earth is redeemed that's why hell can't
[46:32] be
[46:33] Eternal because hell is and the Lake of
[46:36] Fire is
[46:37] created to deal with all the
[46:39] contamination to deal with the sin to
[46:40] deal with all the unbelief brother says
[46:42] Satan sin and sinners have gone forever
[46:44] it all it's all done blended into
[46:46] eternity and all that was perverted that
[46:49] great Archangel that sat there one day
[46:50] Satan that did all of this evil will be
[46:54] destroyed yes all that's going to be
[46:56] destroyed it's going to be gone so it it
[46:59] doesn't even need to be Eternal it won't
[47:02] be Eternal but because we're Eternal
[47:04] that which was created for us will be
[47:08] Eternal this world this original Garden
[47:10] of Eden this Earth was created for us
[47:14] therefore we're coming back to it and
[47:15] it'll be Eternal God having Redemption
[47:18] for us has an eternal Dwelling Place For
[47:20] Us God having a Plan of Redemption
[47:22] there's Eternal properties to those that
[47:25] are redeemed but there is no Redemption
[47:27] for the
[47:27] devil there is no Redemption for his
[47:30] angels so God created these lower
[47:32] Dimensions these lower Realms even the
[47:35] Trinity below he created for Satan he
[47:38] created realms for them to exist in
[47:39] what's going to happen he's going to
[47:40] burn them all up it's going to collapse
[47:43] them all down we say well we have these
[47:44] Dimensions above well what's going to
[47:46] happen to those there's a place where
[47:47] some are waiting right well they're not
[47:50] going to be waiting anymore they're
[47:51] going to be with us and then there's one
[47:52] where there's a a a where God is when
[47:55] brother describes that seven Dimension
[47:57] what's going to happen it's all going to
[47:57] collapse down and then all these nether
[47:59] regions these where these imps dwell
[48:01] these demons and all these fifth
[48:02] dimensions of science are burned up
[48:04] eradicated gone completely changed and
[48:06] then even the devil hell and All His
[48:09] angels and all those who are not written
[48:11] in the Lamb's Book of Life are cast in
[48:13] the Lake of Fire And he says this is the
[48:15] second
[48:16] death brother says hell was created for
[48:18] the devil and his
[48:20] angels it was created for that to
[48:22] destroy
[48:24] it he says it several different
[48:27] places he says you pass now he says in
[48:31] Matthew 25 that it was prepared this
[48:33] Everlasting fire is prepared for the
[48:34] devil and his angels hell's created for
[48:36] because of
[48:38] iniquity wasn't intended for Adam's race
[48:41] it was God think of this God created a
[48:45] place to cast everything else that
[48:47] wouldn't be Eternal into to destroy
[48:50] it not willing that any would
[48:53] perish but he's got a place where
[48:55] reserved so that eventually that's
[48:57] entirely gone and all that's left is the
[49:04] eternity death and
[49:06] Hell the devil then that were deceived
[49:08] or cash in Lake of Fire the Beast and
[49:10] the false
[49:12] prophet all the dead delivered up those
[49:15] that are judged according to the
[49:16] works whoever is not found written in
[49:18] the Book of Life cast in Lake of Fire
[49:20] why it was
[49:22] made to to finish up completely
[49:26] eradicate so that we can have our
[49:29] eternal
[49:32] life brother says now we find that this
[49:34] Earth will hold the kings of the
[49:37] earth and again in Matthew 5:5 Jesus
[49:40] said the meek shall inherit the
[49:42] earth it isn't we're going to have
[49:44] another Earth it's just going to the
[49:47] same Earth or it's go just going to be
[49:50] the same Earth I'm closing on this
[49:53] statement I'm trying to get the planet
[49:55] of of redemption to you if I don't get
[49:57] nothing
[49:59] else that's the beautiful part of the
[50:01] future home some people pick aart future
[50:04] home and I say some people I'm referring
[50:05] to the critics who try to draw it out
[50:07] well he got it from this scholar and he
[50:08] got it from this book and he got it from
[50:09] that book and he said well he's taking
[50:11] all these these truths these Loose Ends
[50:13] he's bringing these things out and what
[50:15] you find out is the very ones that they
[50:17] say he got it from they got it from
[50:18] somebody else and you just kind of run
[50:20] the run it all back guess what it's all
[50:24] coming from the same book yes it's
[50:26] written in this pling as day the great
[50:29] beautiful revelation of it he's trying
[50:30] to get across is the Plan of Redemption
[50:33] he says if I don't get anything else to
[50:34] you if I if you don't get anything else
[50:36] see the Plan of
[50:38] Redemption now how much would it
[50:40] encourage you if you knew that you were
[50:44] right now under the headship of
[50:47] redemption I mean this every single one
[50:50] of you how much would it mean to you
[50:52] right now to know that you are under the
[50:54] promise of
[50:57] redemption but I lost this and I lost
[50:59] that and this is destroyed and this is
[51:00] out of cater and this isn't working well
[51:02] and this is a wreck and this but you're
[51:04] under the law of redemption well it's
[51:08] been 40 something years it's been this
[51:10] but you're under the law of
[51:14] redemption and it's not a law that
[51:16] manmade that can be broken listen the
[51:18] speaker of this house cannot be removed
[51:21] the laws of this Kingdom cannot be
[51:23] changed Heaven and Earth shall change
[51:26] but my word but my law shall not change
[51:30] you are under the power of redemption
[51:33] God says I will redeem I just say give
[51:37] into it I say just yield to it and say
[51:41] God let this Redemption bear itself on
[51:46] me this Plan of
[51:48] Redemption well I believe one day you're
[51:50] going to do it to the earth I believe it
[51:52] was kind of an emphasis that brother
[51:54] Matthew Watkins had had that we don't
[51:56] doubt the word really what we doubt is
[51:58] ourselves and I don't doubt the word
[52:00] will one day create a perfect eth day I
[52:01] don't doubt that there's going to be a
[52:02] new Heaven A New Earth I don't doubt
[52:04] that the New Jerusalem is going to
[52:05] descend out upon it and I've got a lot
[52:06] of faith to believe those things that
[52:08] will be and I'm ignoring the full
[52:10] potential of what the future is
[52:13] now right
[52:15] now I can walk in the liberty of Christ
[52:18] right now I can have heaven on
[52:21] Earth right now I can be living under
[52:23] his Rock under his shelter until all the
[52:26] poison gas is passed right now his power
[52:28] of transformation is changing Me Cell by
[52:32] cell by cell right now the new body is
[52:35] already being formed inside of me how
[52:37] can I be so confident how can I be so
[52:39] sure there's going to be a new Earth one
[52:41] day there's going to be a new body one
[52:45] day oh I'm under his Plan of
[52:52] Redemption let's bow our heads
[53:03] I know it may seem that every service we
[53:04] can bring it to a climax of decision and
[53:09] uh introspection
[53:11] and we challenge ourselves in great ways
[53:14] and maybe it might seem that there's
[53:16] always you might sense maybe some pull
[53:18] like a you got to come to the altar it's
[53:20] always a come to Jesus
[53:21] moment uh but it's not it's not that
[53:26] magnitude that we're we're looking at
[53:27] but I hope you understand that the word
[53:29] that's preached is is
[53:31] eternal and it's supernatural what's
[53:34] happening is Supernatural to bring you
[53:35] to a place right now in his presence of
[53:38] recognition and to say Lord I've heard
[53:41] from you here's my
[53:44] answer here's my answer
[53:48] Lord
[53:49] Redemption he says if I can't get
[53:51] anything else to you get the Plan of
[53:54] Redemption I I want to mean something to
[53:56] you and I want you to by faith believe
[53:59] that God's redeeming
[54:01] things redeeming relationships redeeming
[54:05] Health Lord if there's going to be a
[54:07] Redemption of those things one day I
[54:09] want to see the types of redemption now
[54:11] healing Divine Healing is a type of the
[54:14] body
[54:15] change then I I want to see healing
[54:18] signs and wonders and miracles all these
[54:19] things these are just foreshadows of
[54:21] what the glory of God is going to be in
[54:22] the in the Divine Eighth Day Lord I Want
[54:24] It Now now no sickness no perversion no
[54:27] doubt no
[54:28] death there's things that torment us
[54:31] emotionally we can't seem to get away
[54:33] from there's certain fears that we have
[54:35] that always kind of cycle
[54:37] around myself personally I've been
[54:39] battling with something uh physically in
[54:42] pain for months now persistent constant
[54:45] can't get away from it to the point
[54:47] where I feel like it's going to drive me
[54:48] crazy but there's one thing I won't let
[54:50] go of is the fact that he made me a
[54:52] promise and I will be free and if I've
[54:55] got to fight with it every day of my
[54:57] life I know one day I'm going to be able
[54:59] to look at a body say it's
[55:00] changed I'm free and I won't stop
[55:04] believing in the power of God to deliver
[55:07] no matter how many funerals we have I
[55:09] won't stop believing in the power of God
[55:11] to deliver from sickness to deliver from
[55:13] cancer to deliver from disease no matter
[55:15] how many sleepless nights we may have
[55:18] I'm not going to stop believing in a God
[55:20] that can Comfort our hearts no matter
[55:22] how many limbs we have to cut off I'm
[55:24] not going to Stop Believing in a God
[55:26] that heals from diabetes I believe in a
[55:28] God that can restore limbs restore
[55:30] marriages restore mind restore health
[55:34] because he's a
[55:37] redeemer and I I want to bring it to
[55:39] these these
[55:42] climaxes these points of
[55:46] decision do you realize how we've made
[55:48] this and I've asked you to Bow your
[55:49] heads I want you to think as these words
[55:51] sound out in your hearts maybe you're
[55:52] turning over things in your own lives we
[55:55] we've made so much about the external so
[55:59] much about the external decisions and
[56:01] we're not weighing the gravity of things
[56:03] in our hearts how God's going to make
[56:05] this connection with
[56:07] us I think we need to restore that
[56:10] connection trying to connect I just It
[56:13] just strikes me to say it that way that
[56:15] we think that maybe something magical is
[56:17] going to take place if we just make the
[56:19] right decision externally and what we're
[56:21] needing to do is really connect with
[56:22] something in our hearts to realize this
[56:24] is God this is what I ought to do got to
[56:27] make the connection there sometimes
[56:29] we're wanting to do something external
[56:30] for the connection happen we got to make
[56:31] that connection in our
[56:33] hearts with this desire for
[56:36] Redemption so I ask you
[56:39] tonight have you heard your
[56:43] Jubilee you desire to be set
[56:46] free I believe you have we've there I
[56:49] believe there's been Deliverance there's
[56:50] been setting
[56:52] free but if you want to stand tonight
[56:54] and say this land will not be sold
[56:56] forever stand in
[56:59] testimony that it will not be sold
