[0:00] the title I've given this series is the
[0:02] kingdom but I've used this phrase that I
[0:05] hope kind of stays right in your minds
[0:07] as we go along in this is that heaven's
[0:09] mystery and Earth Glory because there's
[0:12] just those phrases and maybe I'll just
[0:14] pull back the curtain a little bit I
[0:16] toyed with it for a few months is it is
[0:18] it Heaven's glory and Earth's mystery or
[0:21] is it Heaven's mystery and Earth's Glory
[0:23] or is it Heaven's mystery Earth's
[0:24] mystery Earth's Glory Heavens glory and
[0:26] you find out that it's all the same you
[0:28] just had to pick one or the commas would
[0:30] get out of control but Heaven's mystery
[0:33] Earth Glory I think's a mouthful and
[0:34] really means a lot as we go into this I
[0:36] hope it just becomes something for us to
[0:40] begin to think about glorious things
[0:41] that relate to us in our bridegroom
[0:43] Christ from the certain sermon countdown
[0:45] this is um real important thought
[0:49] um to keep reinforcing because this is a
[0:53] real driving factor in this sermon and
[0:56] this is a quote that really stuck in my
[0:58] heart years and years ago even before I
[1:00] began to minister uh and I can still
[1:02] remember the first time I even heard it
[1:03] and it just really stuck with me as this
[1:06] principle
[1:07] um that God is part of God's nature and
[1:09] his character and it was one of those
[1:12] quotes where you know he said it but you
[1:14] just if you have a different way of
[1:15] trying to look it up you won't be able
[1:16] to find it and now I've hopefully
[1:18] imprinted it in my mind so that I won't
[1:21] get lost say what's that one about him
[1:22] moving towards the kingdom but you kind
[1:24] of have to have it going toward the
[1:25] kingdom is this phrase and he says as
[1:28] science achieves something Looking
[1:29] Backward and that's what science does is
[1:31] it regresses God achieves going this
[1:34] away going forward to the kingdom and I
[1:39] would say that as he says God is always
[1:41] going forward to the kingdom that that
[1:43] represents something that is God's
[1:45] ultimate what he's trying to achieve and
[1:48] not that God would always fall short of
[1:50] the goal because we it's not that God's
[1:52] dangling a carrot out in front of
[1:53] himself just to keep him motivated but
[1:55] it's a Target that he has that he knows
[1:57] he's going to achieve and he's going to
[1:59] accomplish it just as God had a heart
[2:01] purpose and something he wanted to
[2:02] achieve and that's what this Kingdom
[2:04] represents and reflects as maybe Sunday
[2:07] or sometime in the near future if God
[2:09] will allow start looking at different
[2:11] aspects of the Kingdom that there must
[2:13] be one who is the most preeminent there
[2:15] must be a domain that he has rulership
[2:17] and authority over and in God's kingdom
[2:19] it's not just a man but it's a man and a
[2:21] woman ruling and reigning together so
[2:23] that's what God wanted to achieve and I
[2:26] would say the kingdom has God's purpose
[2:29] from the beginning
[2:30] God's purpose from the beginning we
[2:32] could use as a phrase just to kind of
[2:33] bring into view a lot of different
[2:35] things is a kingdom or was a kingdom
[2:39] and as we look at part two of the seeds
[2:42] of the Kingdom if I could put it this
[2:44] way in the beginning God planted the
[2:47] seeds of the Kingdom
[2:49] that's kind of how we looked at it on
[2:50] Sunday he planted the seeds of Heaven's
[2:53] mystery and Earth's glory god the
[2:55] invisible God you could just start when
[2:56] he was invisible formed himself in the
[2:58] logos this God who begins to create he
[3:00] creates first by the spoken word in
[3:02] those that spoken word becomes seeds in
[3:04] itself
[3:05] uh that he plants in the beginning he
[3:07] plants the seeds of Heaven's mystery and
[3:10] Earth's glory and if I could say this in
[3:13] the beginning he plants the seeds of his
[3:15] threefold purpose
[3:17] because God brother Brown has a way of
[3:19] uses that incredible sermon which I
[3:21] believe that seventh seal uh that
[3:23] silence lifting from that seventh seal
[3:25] and revealing Christ and he says that
[3:27] God the threefold purpose of Christ and
[3:30] and it just takes in a threefold manner
[3:32] sums up everything that was in the back
[3:34] part of God's mind that was deep in
[3:35] God's heart and so when you think about
[3:37] that it's just so easy to use it as
[3:40] maybe a framework to preach A good
[3:41] sermon and you got your threes and you
[3:43] got your numerology but we got to be
[3:46] careful that in the Simplicity of him
[3:47] breaking it down into three we don't
[3:49] just chop it up into something that's
[3:51] academic one plus one equals two it's
[3:53] just a vast truth that supernatural has
[3:57] brought in the Simplicity of his
[3:59] threefold purpose now in Genesis chapter
[4:02] 1 verse one I'm just jumping into this
[4:04] uh not feet first I'm just diving head
[4:06] in in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in
[4:09] Genesis chapter 2 verse 25 in the
[4:11] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[4:13] Earth and then in verse 25 of chapter 2
[4:16] and they the man and his wife were both
[4:19] naked and were not ashamed as we looked
[4:22] at that we looked at that as bookends or
[4:24] frame of God's original creation the
[4:28] world that God loved the Eden God's
[4:31] pleasure God's Delight his God's
[4:32] pleasure Garden as the different phrases
[4:35] could be used about it used of so in
[4:37] chapter one well there's a lot more than
[4:39] just in the beginning God created the
[4:40] heavens and the Earth but we're going to
[4:41] use that to refer to all the days in
[4:44] which God created and then even when God
[4:46] took his rest we find in verse 25 that
[4:49] the man and the woman they are naked and
[4:52] unashamed it's the man and his wife this
[4:55] is a creation set forth we used even
[4:58] that image of that man and the woman
[5:00] being naked that it even sets them it
[5:03] puts them forth as unadorned as seeds
[5:06] with not ashamed because as a seed you
[5:08] say oh well you're just a seed you're
[5:09] just a bear seed you don't have anything
[5:11] to brag about but in it is the potential
[5:13] to transform itself into a fruit-bearing
[5:16] dream into a full branch a full Vine of
[5:19] different ways you could look at him so
[5:21] he looked at even that image of the man
[5:23] and the woman as seed form of what God's
[5:26] wanting to accomplish and it was brother
[5:28] Kevin Britton was sharing with me how
[5:30] their youngest daughter was making a
[5:32] comment Sister Crystal I gave you a
[5:33] little bit more of the story to Sister
[5:35] Elizabeth and how they were talking
[5:37] about the service and they said well
[5:39] what did Brother Aaron preach about and
[5:41] he said he preached about Adam and Eve
[5:43] and they were both naked
[5:46] and I thought well it's bless God
[5:48] somebody got something out of it and I
[5:51] said and I and I was hoping that she at
[5:53] least knew they weren't ashamed and took
[5:54] that in the right way uh but we know
[5:57] that they're they are listening and I'm
[5:58] probably giving you guys a lot more work
[6:00] than you want uh with some of these
[6:02] things but that's wonderful gives us
[6:03] devotion material
[6:05] but if you if you looked at Genesis
[6:07] chapter one it'd be very easy for you to
[6:09] read these things in your in your
[6:11] devotion time and just slowly read
[6:13] through and looked at how God's creating
[6:15] reminding yourself that a detail in the
[6:17] Bible is important that it's it's not
[6:20] like uh some of these college students
[6:22] do that if they have to write a 700 word
[6:24] essay there's a lot of Vats and ands and
[6:27] you know superlatives just to get to the
[6:30] word limit and God's not just trying to
[6:32] fill up a word limit if he puts it in
[6:33] there there's something weighing in his
[6:36] mind there's something heavy in his
[6:37] heart there's something he wants to
[6:39] bring across to you and one thing that's
[6:42] just something struck me by inspiration
[6:43] and I used a phrase when I was preaching
[6:45] here recently and and I went back I
[6:47] followed back in the scripture and it
[6:49] just became even more real to me how
[6:51] that God in many places you read in the
[6:54] scripture is describing somebody but
[6:56] then when you read it and say wait a
[6:57] minute God's portraying himself
[7:00] in this character and oh it just gets I
[7:03] get goosebumps right now just think
[7:04] about it God is wanting us to see
[7:07] himself in this Prophet God's wanting to
[7:09] see himself and Adam Gods want us to see
[7:11] himself and how God himself was
[7:13] overflowing with inspiration and
[7:15] bubbling up about something and wanting
[7:18] to pour forth declaration so chapter one
[7:21] and chapter two give us so much detail a
[7:24] lot of it I would say symbolic and
[7:26] representing different things but these
[7:27] first two chapters of the Bible all the
[7:30] seeds of God's kingdom are planted
[7:33] all the seeds are sown and if uh if and
[7:38] I'm drawing this from study the message
[7:39] meticulously in the way that brother
[7:41] Branham lays this out that that is I
[7:44] think it's something that we just accept
[7:45] and we don't need to stumble at it that
[7:47] when God spoke the word
[7:49] he speaks at the spoken word is the
[7:51] Original Seed and that that in that and
[7:55] and represented himself the word has
[7:57] come into some manifestation in word
[8:00] form and in it is everything that God
[8:01] wants to be you say well if you put it
[8:03] that way that was that may be easier to
[8:05] digest But as God says in the beginning
[8:07] God created that brings God in the
[8:10] beginning this creation comes forth and
[8:12] these are the seeds chapters of
[8:14] everything God's going to accomplish and
[8:15] it's it's been planted and it is spoken
[8:19] word is this seed that's been sown
[8:21] now as you if you're just taking these
[8:24] cues in ways that you could just be
[8:26] reading your Bible if you're to take to
[8:28] the end of the Bible in Revelations
[8:29] chapter 21
[8:31] and begin to read chapter 21 and chapter
[8:33] 22 we'll find that the last two chapters
[8:35] of the Bible I'm presenting to you that
[8:38] the seeds that God sowed in the
[8:40] beginning the seeds of God's kingdom are
[8:42] now eternally mature
[8:44] that now they have secured their
[8:46] permanent position they have manifested
[8:48] in their perfection and their Glory what
[8:50] is represented kind of in this preview
[8:52] of Glory in the Eden in the beginning we
[8:54] now get to the end and I think it's
[8:55] appropriate to think of that as being
[8:56] the Eden in the end that now God's
[8:59] kingdom is established forever in an
[9:01] eighth day eternally as you begin to
[9:03] read in these last two chapters of the
[9:05] Bible the seeds that were spoken into
[9:07] existence in the first two chapters are
[9:09] now permanently secure and mature in the
[9:11] end
[9:12] it says in Revelations 21 it describes
[9:15] uh new heavens and new earth
[9:17] it describes the bride of Christ the New
[9:19] Jerusalem right these are things that
[9:20] are being described and notice in these
[9:22] three verses here in chapter 22 and he
[9:25] showed me a pure River of Water of Life
[9:27] clear as Crystal
[9:29] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[9:30] of the lamb in the midst of the street
[9:33] of it and on either side of the river
[9:35] was there the tree of life so now the
[9:38] image that we could start creating
[9:39] between in the beginning and now in the
[9:42] never-ending beginning uh there's a a
[9:45] representation of the tree of life
[9:47] there's a glory there's an Eden and it
[9:49] says that there on the other side of the
[9:52] river was there the Tree of Life which
[9:53] beared 12 manner of fruits and yielded
[9:55] her fruit every month I I find myself
[9:58] just
[10:00] uh hating have to just skim over these
[10:02] things but and the leaves of the tree
[10:04] for the healing of the Nations wow what
[10:06] Rich things and remember this for later
[10:08] and there shall be no more curse but the
[10:10] Throne of God and the lamb shall be in
[10:12] it and his servant Shall Serve him and
[10:14] it continues on but I want you to just
[10:16] catch this picture at the end that now
[10:19] we have the Tree of Life
[10:21] that is going to be for the healing of
[10:23] Nations and now this is God has already
[10:25] represented this symbolically in symbol
[10:27] form and Seed form in the beginning so
[10:29] I'm just want to think in the beginning
[10:30] these first two chapters and now in the
[10:33] end what we see represented here these
[10:35] are the seeds of the kingdom in the
[10:36] beginning this is the kingdom in the end
[10:38] Genesis 1 1 God created the heavens and
[10:41] the Earth
[10:42] Revelations 21 1 John sees a new Heaven
[10:45] and a new Earth see the Symmetry see how
[10:48] these things the picture in the end in
[10:49] Genesis 1 16 the Bible says that the sun
[10:52] will rule the day and the moon rules the
[10:54] night
[10:55] Revelations 21 24 it says the city had
[10:57] no need for the sun or moon
[10:59] now that's so think of that how there's
[11:02] something that God Expresses in the
[11:03] beginning but now in the end it's not
[11:05] the god
[11:07] if I could say this is what God was
[11:09] progressing to this is where God wanted
[11:11] to end up
[11:13] and and I will acknowledge since I know
[11:16] you all remember every single sermon
[11:17] I've preached in every quote and every
[11:19] scripture and somebody's you know they
[11:21] have ledgers how many times they say
[11:22] Ponder and so I know they're keeping a
[11:25] ledger of when I preach these things and
[11:27] what I say and and they're pondering all
[11:29] these pontifications and things that are
[11:30] being mentioned but in that uh in this
[11:33] these some of these things were
[11:34] mentioned I know that I went over this
[11:36] in great detail already in uh previously
[11:39] in a series on in the beginning was the
[11:40] title of it and so if you want to go
[11:42] back and listen to this I know I've
[11:44] preached these some of these things
[11:45] before and I it doesn't bother me it
[11:47] doesn't bother me at all that I've
[11:48] preached it before uh and you can go
[11:50] back and hear it in Greater detail if
[11:52] you want to subscribe to our Channel
[11:56] and so it says that the Sun and the Moon
[11:58] rule won the day one the night but then
[12:00] in Revelations 21 there's going to be no
[12:02] need for the sun or moon and what I'm
[12:04] wanting to identify is this symmetry how
[12:06] that specifically Revelations 21 is now
[12:10] calling back to the beginning
[12:13] Genesis 1 5 God creates darkness and
[12:15] night God's doing this in the beginning
[12:17] but now in Revelation 21 25 it says
[12:19] there shall be no night there
[12:21] now notice how God if we know that the
[12:25] last chapter wasn't written when he
[12:26] created but if you can think about how
[12:29] that God now is forecasting things and
[12:32] God is producing contrast that in the
[12:35] end he wants to do away with the
[12:37] contrast because he's wanting to achieve
[12:40] something
[12:41] and so as you as you look at that
[12:44] I'm wanting you just to see how there's
[12:46] things in the beginning and there's
[12:47] things in the end and I'm not wanting to
[12:50] look at it as opposites but I'm wanting
[12:51] to look at how this is what it was in
[12:52] the seed form this is what it is and
[12:54] it's per and it's a manifestation full
[12:56] manifestation
[12:57] now if you'll look at our text again I
[13:00] want to start with verse 36 and Matthew
[13:02] 13.
[13:04] it says in Matthew 13 36 then Jesus sent
[13:07] the multitude away and and they're in
[13:09] the house they say declaring us the
[13:10] parable the tears of the field we could
[13:12] have read this earlier in verses 24 to
[13:14] 30. and now he's just very direct he
[13:17] that soweth the good seed is the son of
[13:19] man
[13:21] and in verse 24 the son of man then sows
[13:24] the seed in his field
[13:27] it's important to note that
[13:28] we know that Satan didn't create the
[13:30] Earth this isn't his ground
[13:33] so the seed is sown and it's good seed
[13:36] and it's in his field and the field is
[13:38] the world the good seed are the children
[13:40] of the Kingdom
[13:42] but the chairs are the children of the
[13:45] wicked one there we could just Branch
[13:48] off of that into the original sin
[13:50] and recognize that what we call the
[13:53] doctrine of original sin is uh we is one
[13:57] thing the consequence of that is what we
[13:58] call serpent seed and it's best to look
[14:01] at that as a hybrid between the the man
[14:04] and the woman as God originally intended
[14:06] to be and the the serpent which was a an
[14:10] upright uh being creature that could
[14:14] speak and would have had some Affinity
[14:17] to humanity in terms of the way they
[14:18] look and even allow those Bloodlines to
[14:21] mix and and that's the resulting
[14:23] mongrelizes brother bam uses the word
[14:25] but the hybrid the weakening of the
[14:27] Nations or the weakening of the people
[14:28] through the original sin I think
[14:31] sometimes we get this doctrine of uh
[14:32] serpent seed to where we just look out
[14:35] and uh and we look out in a restaurant
[14:37] and we just say Vipers every one of them
[14:40] just vipers and and and really we're
[14:44] hissing when we say that
[14:47] right you don't realize it but you're
[14:48] going
[14:49] snipers everything a lot of them right
[14:52] because you've got hybrid flesh
[14:55] and the election is what God sowed
[14:59] and and that's according to election
[15:01] Divine favor and Grace in this body is
[15:04] hybrid it's come fallen and nature comes
[15:06] fallen so there's a lot that we could
[15:08] really dig into and if the Lord would
[15:10] lead I'm more than happy too uh go into
[15:12] those details of the original sin and
[15:14] the resulting of serpent seed as a
[15:17] result of that right let's take this
[15:19] principle that if the son of man sowed
[15:21] good seed we say God
[15:24] sold perfect seed John 1 1 in the
[15:27] beginning was the word and the word
[15:30] brought forth Heaven and Earth I'm
[15:32] drawing a lot from Sunday morning to
[15:34] make those statements so God's word
[15:36] brings forth the Heaven and the Earth
[15:38] God sows good seed now I want to look at
[15:42] a few scriptures so that we can
[15:44] recognize and I guess I'm just gonna
[15:46] have to say it I'm not trying to hide
[15:47] this but go listen to Future home
[15:49] and I'm wanting to recognize the
[15:52] permanence and the Eternal quality of
[15:54] those things which are spoken word
[15:57] attributes of God
[15:59] and so in Psalm 8 verse 3 it says when I
[16:02] considered thy Heavens the work of thy
[16:04] fingers the moon and the stars which
[16:07] thou Hast ordained so when we think of
[16:10] even the moon the stars and the heavens
[16:12] as the firmament and the skies is
[16:13] different from the earth it is things
[16:16] that are the works of his hands and
[16:19] which he has ordained it's by the word
[16:22] of God that the heavens were framed that
[16:24] the earth was formed so we understand by
[16:26] faith and believe as Christians that God
[16:28] created the Heaven and the Earth by his
[16:30] word
[16:31] that these are things that step forth
[16:33] fresh from God's mind and he put them
[16:35] forward uh with a and I don't want to
[16:38] just say created them but he had a
[16:40] purpose and he ordained them and
[16:42] predetermined something about them
[16:45] and then in Job chapter 38 and I had a
[16:47] few more verses around this because I
[16:49] just love
[16:50] uh the bands of Orion and the the
[16:53] different ways that the God is
[16:55] challenging job and look at this Heavens
[16:58] did you lay these out there do you
[17:01] determine do you determine these things
[17:02] did you set these forth and this
[17:04] language knoweth thou the ordinances of
[17:06] Heaven do you know the statute and
[17:08] enactment of the stars in the heavens
[17:11] can't thou set the Dominion thereof in
[17:14] the Earth
[17:15] there is a rule and a Dominion of the
[17:18] heavens and the Earth is what he's
[17:19] saying can you do that well no man can't
[17:22] man only studies it but God did that he
[17:26] they're the ordinance the statutes of
[17:28] the heaven something bound up in it it
[17:30] was the heavens were God's first Bible
[17:31] so he was deliberate in how he laid
[17:34] these things out and you can see that
[17:36] and even his man studied it and they
[17:37] they see the serpents meet in that and
[17:39] they see Orion and they see the
[17:41] different constellations and they see
[17:43] even uh the representation and different
[17:46] things and God is declaring something in
[17:48] his Bible or his first Bible in the
[17:50] heavens these are the ordinances or the
[17:52] enactments of the stars and of the
[17:54] heavens that God ordained
[17:56] and there is a Dominion of them in the
[17:59] earth some Rule and authority and this
[18:01] connection to Earth so it's God by his
[18:04] ordination and predetermination laid out
[18:07] the stars in the firmament in the
[18:08] heavens
[18:09] and then in speaking of the heavens in
[18:11] Psalms 148 verse 6 it says he hath also
[18:14] established them forever and ever them
[18:17] this is the heavens he hath made a
[18:20] decree which shall not pass
[18:22] now that's uh I'll say this at this
[18:26] point it's written in the gospels in
[18:28] three different places I believe it's
[18:29] verbatim every single time Heaven nurse
[18:31] shall pass away but my words
[18:33] shall never pass away shall not pass
[18:34] away and now this is and I think I say
[18:38] it just to introduce a paradox
[18:41] because now he has established the
[18:42] heavens which shall not pass and has
[18:44] made a decree which shall not pass so
[18:46] something just to think about what it
[18:47] means heaven or shall not pass or pass
[18:49] away what is meant by that phrase and
[18:51] that saying but the word will never pass
[18:53] away
[18:54] and these are this is an important
[18:56] principle of the Kingdom this is an
[18:59] important principle as we want to look
[19:00] deeper into some of the things that
[19:02] brother Branham says in the future home
[19:03] that to me are just very very striking
[19:05] and settling and help us understand a
[19:07] lot of things that have eternal quality
[19:09] and other things that do not that yet
[19:11] can be sustained eternally but aren't
[19:14] spoken word attributes of God
[19:16] and so God has established the heavens
[19:18] by his fingers by his ordination there's
[19:20] the ordinances of Heaven the Dominion
[19:22] thereof in the earth establish them
[19:23] forever and ever he's made a decree
[19:25] which shall not pass these are important
[19:27] principles of the kingdom in the
[19:29] beginning God created the heavens and
[19:30] the Earth
[19:31] and his spoken word is the Original Seed
[19:34] Bill Abram says now this word of God is
[19:36] eternal
[19:37] God being infinite cannot speak one
[19:40] thing and then later on change it to
[19:42] something else to a better decision
[19:49] Ah that's nice
[19:52] because every decision of god is perfect
[19:57] he cannot now this is the the
[20:00] punch here once his word is once spoken
[20:04] it can never die
[20:06] it lives on on and can never die because
[20:09] it is God
[20:11] so once it is spoken it cannot die it
[20:16] lives on because it is God his word can
[20:18] no more die than he can die
[20:20] now that's that's a lot I think that
[20:22] there's some f to that there's some
[20:24] weight there's some turning over that we
[20:25] can do in our hearts to try to
[20:27] understand that every decision of god is
[20:29] perfect once his word is spoken it lives
[20:32] on on and can never die
[20:36] as we could draw from the principles we
[20:38] used on Sunday morning on how that
[20:40] once the word is there it will manifest
[20:43] whatever life is in it whatever it'll be
[20:45] It's gotta manifest it's got to come
[20:47] forward
[20:48] so if I want to just step forward in
[20:50] this but can we uh just by by just by
[20:54] ESP or telepathy just kind of inform me
[20:56] right now that we're all on the same
[20:58] page
[20:59] good
[21:01] because I want to go forward in this and
[21:03] I want to use a statement that hopefully
[21:04] we could just cover a lot of ground in
[21:05] reading this remember I said he's the
[21:08] Creator and the sermon Abraham and
[21:10] remember this once God speaks his word
[21:12] it can never die
[21:14] once it speaks his word it can never die
[21:16] he's the Creator he could do anything he
[21:18] wants to he just picked up some
[21:19] petroleum and Cosmic light and calcium
[21:21] and potash and blow it into it and
[21:23] stepped into the body and come down
[21:24] that's the exact exactly the way he did
[21:27] it he had Angels there the same way he
[21:30] can do the same thing where did he come
[21:33] from who made the Earth
[21:35] where did he get the stuff to make the
[21:37] Earth out of tell me where he went out
[21:40] and got it at
[21:42] the very Earth that we're setting on is
[21:45] the word of God made manifest I know
[21:48] there's layers to this but the very
[21:50] Earth that we're sitting on is the word
[21:52] of God made manifest the pulpit is the
[21:54] word of God
[21:55] this is the word of God made manifest
[21:57] he's saying that man that this is
[22:00] the this wood this genuine Hardwood
[22:04] comes back to some element that God had
[22:06] created
[22:07] but this
[22:09] base principle the Earth we're setting
[22:11] on as the word of God made manifest the
[22:13] pulpit the word of God this is the word
[22:14] of God made manifest God spoke it and
[22:16] he's the Creator and he made it out of
[22:18] things that we're not here that we're
[22:20] not here to make it with in other words
[22:22] he speaks originally the one who speaks
[22:24] and by and nothing exists and by that he
[22:26] forms things he created he says God of
[22:29] purpose he can create he can do whatever
[22:31] he wants to he's God
[22:33] now that to me becomes kind of the uh
[22:38] the final say
[22:40] he said oh well you can't do that well
[22:42] no God can can do whatever he wants no
[22:44] but you know no God's God he can do
[22:46] whatever he wants but he has a purpose
[22:48] in doing it and so when he does
[22:50] something he's not just doing it for
[22:51] kicks he's very deliberate very
[22:53] intentional about it and he says the
[22:55] Earth is a the word of God made manifest
[22:58] and then when he says about the pulpit
[23:01] and I believe he's saying that this
[23:02] Pulpit it's the word of God made
[23:04] manifest because it's drawn from
[23:07] elements that God spoke into existence
[23:09] in the beginning and I know there's a
[23:10] lot of chain that we can think of there
[23:12] uh that maybe interrupts and hybrid and
[23:15] manipulated and fabricated into
[23:17] different things in it but he said he's
[23:19] God and as he says he creates a body out
[23:21] of all these elements in the earth he
[23:22] can step into it he's preaching about
[23:24] Abraham the Earth is a spoken word
[23:26] attribute of God God can do this is the
[23:29] word of God made manifest he has a
[23:31] purpose God can do whatever he wants uh
[23:33] the thing that just kept striking my
[23:35] heart is if this is so
[23:38] of the earth then what about the those
[23:41] attributes that God created the Earth
[23:44] for the purpose of expressing what about
[23:46] his what about his elect
[23:48] what about those that he desires to have
[23:51] fellowship with and you're going to
[23:53] listen to uh things that ought to be in
[23:55] December 5th of 1965 and he's saying you
[23:58] are the manifestation of the gene of
[24:00] life that was in God and that it's your
[24:02] duty to express God to your neighbors
[24:05] and in your your those you associate
[24:07] with and that's no light sentence that's
[24:10] that's no light meat that That's Heavy
[24:12] that that's the word of God in this last
[24:14] days because you are the manifestation
[24:16] of the gene of life that was in God in
[24:18] the beginning that means even before God
[24:20] ever formed himself into logos he had
[24:23] certain attributes and then we realized
[24:25] that you are now expressing that and you
[24:27] are a bear of that and you are
[24:30] representing that so that's what you are
[24:33] you are a manifestation of God just in
[24:36] the Summers of this Earth this Earth is
[24:37] intended to be a spoken word attribute
[24:39] of God a manifestation of God then what
[24:41] about this Earth
[24:44] what about what God wants me to express
[24:46] and declare
[24:47] so as in the beginning
[24:50] the son of man soweth good seed
[24:53] in the world
[24:55] the good seat are the children of the
[24:56] Kingdom but then the wicked one comes
[24:58] secondarily
[25:00] and he sows Terrors which are called
[25:02] Children of the wicked one
[25:04] now
[25:05] in verse 39 it says the enemy that sowed
[25:09] them is the devil
[25:11] the Harvest is the end of the world
[25:15] and the reapers are
[25:17] the angels
[25:19] now I'll say that there's certainly no
[25:21] shortage of material to preach when it
[25:23] comes to the message of the hour
[25:25] and so the real challenge becomes how
[25:28] can you take something that's Eternal
[25:30] and put it in a snippet
[25:31] on a Wednesday night and that's the real
[25:33] that's why you're praying for me I trust
[25:36] is to be able to I think if somebody
[25:38] said they're trying to drink out of a
[25:39] fire hydrant or something
[25:41] but that's what we're trying to do is to
[25:44] get you in front of that fire hydrant
[25:45] long enough to get something out of it
[25:47] and so if it doesn't if you're left
[25:51] wanting more and if I fail to just get
[25:54] it across in a way that it deserves to
[25:55] be brought across keep praying for me
[25:58] I'm applying myself more and more and
[26:00] trying to humble myself more and more to
[26:02] do the best that I can for you but and I
[26:05] realize there's there's a lacking there
[26:07] when you look at the full picture how
[26:08] can you describe this how can you really
[26:10] describe this so I'm just pulling
[26:12] elements and trying just to express this
[26:14] and this is the next element I want you
[26:16] to look at this enemy that sowed them as
[26:18] the devil the Harvest is the end of the
[26:19] world and the reapers are the Angels God
[26:21] made the Earth for a purpose brother
[26:22] Graham said and Satan defiled it defiled
[26:25] the purpose even defiled the Earth
[26:27] so we could go back to Genesis chapter
[26:29] three so Genesis chapter 1 and chapter
[26:31] two God sows his seed The Original Seed
[26:33] the son of man sowed good seed every
[26:35] word has been sown every word has been
[26:38] spoken once God speaks his word it lives
[26:40] on and on and on and on and can't die
[26:43] all right so we got that part down now
[26:45] the next thing that sowed is by the
[26:48] wicked one the enemy which is the devil
[26:50] he sows Bad Seed so in Genesis Chapter 3
[26:54] The Wicked one sow seeds that bring
[26:57] forth the tares
[26:59] and these tares then
[27:01] he achieves it because he doesn't have
[27:03] his own seed he achieves it by hybriding
[27:07] and by mixing seed and God had brought
[27:10] forth seed and that seed was to stay in
[27:13] a particular way and express itself in a
[27:15] particular way and as long as it stayed
[27:17] in its Lane it fulfilled God's purpose
[27:19] and it would manifest what God intended
[27:21] it to but as soon as you took things God
[27:23] was very particular in the beginning
[27:25] this has to be each after its kind this
[27:28] one don't do this don't do that what was
[27:31] he doing don't mix don't uh intermingle
[27:34] and so what Satan did is he sowed seed
[27:37] by mixing
[27:39] and so it was a perversion of the
[27:42] original seed and a diversion from God's
[27:44] original program
[27:46] so what Satan has not done is Satan has
[27:48] not created of his own
[27:51] he has not he God didn't say God created
[27:54] and then saying goes okay all right I
[27:55] see what you did there let's see what we
[27:56] can do and then he creates that's not
[27:58] what happens
[27:59] and so brother Brenner makes the
[28:01] statement in power of transformation
[28:02] science is taking the natural things and
[28:05] perverting it to do the things that it
[28:07] wasn't intended to do
[28:09] that's a statement that stands that can
[28:12] be applied in so many different ways
[28:13] taking natural things and perverting it
[28:15] to do things that it wasn't intended to
[28:17] do so Satan's kingdom was set up because
[28:20] we know science and these things are
[28:22] part of Satan civilization science takes
[28:25] natural things and perverts it in ways
[28:28] that it wasn't intended to do Satan's
[28:30] kingdom was set up by perverting God's
[28:32] original spoken word
[28:35] that's what science is doing is taking
[28:37] natural things and perverted it they're
[28:38] not invent creating new substance
[28:41] they're perverting existing substance so
[28:44] that's Satan's kingdom that's Satan's
[28:46] program he doesn't vary from the way
[28:48] that he does things he set up his
[28:50] kingdom and I think it's important to
[28:52] recognize that Satan has a kingdom he
[28:54] set up his kingdom by perverting the
[28:56] original program The Original Seed
[28:59] and brother Branham says and the seed
[29:00] shall not be air with the shuck the
[29:02] kingdom of God which is in the Earth
[29:03] today
[29:04] can never be set up justly on a
[29:07] permissive will it's got to come back to
[29:10] his perfect will so in the beginning God
[29:13] spoke his word that's his perfect will
[29:15] that's his program everything clicking
[29:18] on everything bringing forth if it's
[29:19] kind it could do nothing else because
[29:21] God said so that's the way that God kind
[29:24] of sets it forward that's the momentum
[29:26] enter the wicked one who hybrids and
[29:29] perverts and it's the scientific
[29:31] approach that takes seeds and mixes them
[29:33] together to do what produce a better
[29:35] Kingdom a more glorious Kingdom but that
[29:38] it's not it's not better it's not more
[29:40] glorious in doing so it produces death
[29:43] that's what brother Branham is saying in
[29:44] Satan's Eden power to power of
[29:46] transformation these are all the
[29:47] principles that were just you know we
[29:49] just feel that fire hydrant knocking our
[29:51] teeth out as we try to drink from it
[29:52] these are all the things flowing forth
[29:54] in that so the kingdom of God was set up
[29:57] on God's perfect will and it only will
[30:00] be repositioned on God's perfect will
[30:05] the perfect will God's God's original
[30:06] word The Original Seed
[30:09] so then the kingdoms of this world as we
[30:12] would use that phrase are not the
[30:15] original
[30:16] they're secondary they're perverted
[30:19] they're not again God God didn't cast
[30:23] Satan out of heaven and then as Satan
[30:25] was tumbling he kind of just said well I
[30:27] need a place to land and created an
[30:28] earth and now that's Satan's kingdom and
[30:30] Heaven is God's kingdom now the Earth is
[30:32] Satan's kingdom and now the two have
[30:33] been warring ever since and when God's
[30:35] done and I think we touched on this a
[30:37] couple Wednesday nights ago when God's
[30:39] done is this going to destroy the Earth
[30:40] and banish Satan to hell and everybody
[30:42] who lived on Earth you better have chose
[30:43] Heaven over hell or you're going to end
[30:45] up in hell too
[30:46] that's not the way that it plays out in
[30:49] in the Catholic comics
[30:52] and so this is
[30:54] the the kingdom of this world they're
[30:56] secondary they are the perversion of
[30:59] God's original spoken word
[31:01] now listen to the way that brother Bram
[31:03] says this in the sermon you must be born
[31:04] again and this is
[31:06] uh I really feel the Liberty to use this
[31:09] because of the statements we used on
[31:11] Sunday morning then in came sin
[31:15] and send marred the picture there's that
[31:17] framing of Genesis 1 chapter 2 and and
[31:20] the beautiful picture of God God's
[31:22] Masterpiece the Masterpiece family
[31:24] walled behind the word of God and then
[31:26] sin comes in Satan snucked in and marred
[31:28] God's Masterpiece but sin can't stop the
[31:32] purpose of God
[31:33] God will not be defeated
[31:36] so then because sin came in woman
[31:39] brought forth man which was secondary a
[31:41] perverted way God never created him out
[31:44] of the Dust of the Earth with his own
[31:45] hands the woman had to bring him through
[31:47] sex and we know that this is how all
[31:49] creation has populated upon the face of
[31:51] the Earth since the fall then what
[31:54] happened
[31:55] are you ready for something to keep you
[31:56] up tonight
[31:57] when we make our bodies from the dust of
[31:59] the earth that calcium that Lumber that
[32:01] potash that God had laid out is still
[32:04] being used
[32:07] one day the last bit of it will be used
[32:10] up
[32:11] God laid out all of his material
[32:14] that's right the lumbar pile will go
[32:16] down
[32:18] God but God still makes man from the
[32:20] dust of the Earth
[32:22] and you come on this Earth without
[32:24] having any reason anyway no way at all
[32:27] you had of bringing yourself here God
[32:31] brought you here
[32:33] you say well how how could that be the
[32:36] only way that the only one who could
[32:38] architect this is God
[32:41] who can lay all the material out in such
[32:43] a way and know that this one's going to
[32:45] do this and this is going to happen
[32:46] that's going to happen this is going to
[32:47] happen that's only God could do that
[32:50] oh only God has that power and that
[32:52] capacity to do that and and it's and
[32:54] it's represented I think in a very
[32:56] simple way not that we could just
[32:58] completely figure out like whoa I tapped
[33:00] into the Matrix Matrix and I see it all
[33:02] but just to accept that God laid all his
[33:04] material out there and and all of that's
[33:07] got to be used because he had an
[33:09] intention he was very deliberate about
[33:10] this it's all being laid out there and
[33:12] he says one day the lumber pile will go
[33:15] down in other words there's got to be a
[33:17] time when the last one is expressed and
[33:21] the Earth is filled up because the seeds
[33:23] that God had envisioned that would come
[33:25] forth from this Earth have been made
[33:27] manifest and he says one day the lumber
[33:30] power will go down he's saying God
[33:31] brought you here
[33:33] God brought you here when we make up our
[33:36] these bodies are still coming from these
[33:37] original elements that God put into the
[33:40] earth now he's saying that sin came in
[33:43] and interrupted God's program but
[33:45] everything is he's still using things
[33:48] that God put here in the beginning
[33:49] they've just been perverted from their
[33:51] natural form
[33:52] now I I just feel that I've got to
[33:55] express this at this moment so that you
[33:57] could understand
[33:58] I'm I'm in no way just wanting to tickle
[34:01] your ears
[34:02] I I absolutely have no desire to impress
[34:05] you with message theology uh well maybe
[34:07] I wouldn't mind impressing you some but
[34:09] I certainly wouldn't want to only do
[34:10] that my desire is that the word of God
[34:14] could begin to permeate every thought
[34:17] that that as I expressed to the the
[34:20] young people at a graduation banquet
[34:21] here recently you're going to find God's
[34:23] glory in everyday life if you're gonna
[34:25] go out there you're gonna try to hunt it
[34:27] down on a Saturday night at the
[34:28] convention you're going to try to hunt
[34:29] it down over here and hunt it down over
[34:30] there and you want to find your glory in
[34:32] a church service you're going to miss
[34:33] most of God's glory because you're going
[34:35] to find God's glory in everyday life
[34:38] and what I would I would want is that
[34:40] these things would be because I believe
[34:42] this is what the message of the hour has
[34:43] done I I trust that what I'm I am is I'm
[34:47] a faithful Minister under the son of man
[34:49] under under a son of man Christ has been
[34:53] revealed by a prophet and I'm a minister
[34:55] under the under my messenger and I'm
[34:58] declaring to you I believe what has
[34:59] already been preached in its most simple
[35:01] way and this message talk a God who is
[35:04] boundless and put them in such simple
[35:06] terms so that we could find ourselves
[35:09] finding meaning in washing dishes
[35:11] planting potatoes loving our wives and I
[35:14] would that the word of God would begin
[35:16] to permeate or every thought
[35:20] just give uh have some
[35:24] give us purpose
[35:26] to motivate our action
[35:28] to begin to see God's purpose in
[35:30] everyday life
[35:31] when he says that our bodies come from
[35:33] the dust of the earth and God brought
[35:34] you here or you have to come out of this
[35:37] realm uh it's just by circumstance and
[35:39] happenstance and this is all a mistake I
[35:42] think one of the main things that we
[35:44] labored on when we ministered that first
[35:45] series here at the church as we wanted
[35:47] you to recognize that God was setting
[35:50] these things forth and what Satan did
[35:52] was to fulfill was to bring to pass that
[35:55] which was necessary
[35:58] and then you begin to see the whole plan
[35:59] of God and then you say well God you
[36:02] know what you're doing
[36:04] one thing I've been saying a lot to
[36:06] people as of late and whether it be in
[36:08] counseling and just encouraging is just
[36:10] remember God will have the final say
[36:13] and God did something very Supernatural
[36:15] for me
[36:17] I'm studying recently on something and I
[36:19] just wrote in my notes that the church
[36:21] the squirrels will chatter but the eagle
[36:23] will rise
[36:25] and I had it happen in in one in one day
[36:28] something happened and and I realized
[36:31] that's the chattering of the squirrel
[36:33] the chirping of the Chipmunk
[36:35] and as I was driving later on that day
[36:37] the closest an eagle has ever come to me
[36:39] I Saw an Eagle come down and grab which
[36:41] I'm going to say was A Chipmunk it was
[36:43] furry and then just rise up and flew
[36:46] away my wife was a witness to it just
[36:48] flew away right past me and I remembered
[36:51] the squirrels will chatter but the eagle
[36:53] will rise and listen let them chirp
[36:56] chirp chirp chirp chirp all they want to
[36:58] God will get the final say Amen and it
[37:01] doesn't have to be chirping back I know
[37:03] that's how they do it the great great
[37:05] the goats of these days know how to talk
[37:06] trash and and let's just say that the
[37:09] goat he is the greatest uh the greatest
[37:11] rebuttal he has is just to be gone
[37:14] and they're just like where'd they go
[37:18] hey God will get the final say
[37:21] so the enemy that sold it is sold it is
[37:23] the devil the wicked one sows this
[37:26] perversion in Eden
[37:29] ow
[37:31] so Genesis 3 1 we could say the devil is
[37:33] in the garden perverting the spoken word
[37:34] but as we read Matthew 13 God promises a
[37:38] harvest
[37:39] verse 41 the son of man shall send forth
[37:41] his angels and they Shall Gather out of
[37:43] his kingdom all that offend whose
[37:47] kingdom his kingdom
[37:49] he is going to gather out anything that
[37:53] offends and then which do iniquity and
[37:55] so cast them into a furnace of fire
[37:57] there shall be wailing and gnashing of
[37:59] teeth then shall the righteous shine
[38:02] forth as the Son and the kingdom of
[38:03] their father who hath ears to hear Let
[38:06] Them hear now I think there's different
[38:08] ways that I one could apply those
[38:10] statements in different levels
[38:13] but notice how he says that he's going
[38:16] to gather out of his kingdom all things
[38:17] that offend and it's the devil that's
[38:19] done this
[38:21] so let's look there's going to be a
[38:22] harvest and in that Harvest there's a
[38:24] separation and there's a dealing with
[38:26] the tares and the seeds that have been
[38:28] sown and the perversion and iniquity and
[38:30] all that offends all those things are
[38:31] going to be gathered out they're going
[38:32] to be dealt with
[38:33] so in the Harvest he's extracting
[38:35] anything that doesn't fit the purpose of
[38:38] the original or does it find its place
[38:41] in God's program of redemption
[38:44] and so in Revelations chapter 20 verse
[38:47] 10 it says and the devil that deceived
[38:49] them
[38:50] was cast into the Lake of Fire in
[38:52] Brimstone where the Beast and the false
[38:55] prophet are and shall be tormented day
[38:57] and night forever and ever
[39:00] do you recognize then what's transpiring
[39:02] is that just as the parable says that
[39:06] the wicked one who caused these things
[39:08] to offend God's going to deal with them
[39:10] and he's going to take out of the
[39:11] Kingdom anything that offends and he's
[39:13] going to cast The Devil into the Lake of
[39:15] Fire just as there's going to be a
[39:18] casting into a furnace of fire according
[39:20] to this parable
[39:23] and if I could say this the result of
[39:26] the Fall will be remedied will be dealt
[39:29] with will be addressed
[39:31] but God's word must be satisfied the
[39:34] Bible says that his word will not return
[39:36] void when God speaks it can never die it
[39:39] lives on and on and on therefore if I
[39:42] could say it this way Redemption is
[39:44] immutable
[39:46] if God's word will always live that
[39:50] means Redemption is necessary that's I I
[39:54] just I can't hold it back the things
[39:58] that the god laid out Abraham and his
[40:00] seed not just to tell a story but so
[40:05] that he could just lay out all the
[40:07] shadows and types and the seeds of
[40:08] redemption and he gave them rules and
[40:11] laws of Redemption how to redeem a a
[40:13] family member how to redeem a land how
[40:16] to redeem an inheritance it wasn't just
[40:19] there so that they could Israel would
[40:21] always have a kingdom and Israel would
[40:22] always be somebody but God is trying to
[40:24] say this Earth is mine and my the title
[40:28] deed may have been lost by man but I
[40:30] retain the rights to Redemption and the
[40:33] land shall not be sold forever I will
[40:36] get it back
[40:38] because the word requires it
[40:41] because God says when he speaks
[40:43] something it's that means Redemption is
[40:45] immutable it must happen
[40:49] and so then you could do as we did
[40:51] already with Genesis chapter 1 and
[40:52] chapter 2 and see the the seats come to
[40:55] fruition in the beginning look at how
[40:57] God deals with Genesis chapter 3.
[40:59] Genesis chapter 3 verse 16 you can say
[41:01] sorrow is Born Into Humanity
[41:04] Revelations 21 4 there shall be no more
[41:07] sorrow
[41:08] because God is going to do what gather
[41:10] all things out of his kingdom that
[41:11] offends
[41:13] Satan brought sorrow God takes sorrow
[41:15] out in Revelations 21. Revelation
[41:17] Genesis 3 17 curse we saw those curses
[41:21] in Genesis Genesis 3 Revelations 22 3
[41:24] there shall be no more curse
[41:27] in Genesis 3 lies sin murder
[41:31] intercreation what does verse 27 say no
[41:34] lie no Abomination no defilement shall
[41:36] enter
[41:37] what has God done everything that
[41:39] entered in God's just taken right out
[41:42] God had it framed his world perfect the
[41:45] seeds of the Kingdom Satan comes in and
[41:48] sows seeds into that Kingdom now in the
[41:50] end God is saying I've dealt with all of
[41:52] it I've taken it all out and he's
[41:54] Gathering out everything that offends
[41:56] Genesis 3 death enters Revelations 21 4
[41:59] there shall be no more death
[42:02] Genesis 3 24 mankind is kept from the
[42:05] Tree of Life Revelations 22 2 the tree
[42:08] of life is in that City and they shall
[42:10] have a right to the Tree of Life in
[42:11] verse 14. it's showing that everything
[42:14] that this curse everything that the
[42:17] wicked one did and brought in the end
[42:20] God has reversed it why because
[42:22] Redemption is immutable God's word
[42:25] cannot be stopped
[42:28] I can't remember if it was you brother
[42:30] Michael that said it kind of does away
[42:31] with the chess match
[42:33] because people just have Gods over there
[42:36] at a chess board and he's put on he's
[42:37] made a move and then Satan makes a move
[42:39] and God's like
[42:41] and they're just kind of both watching
[42:42] the clock and looking at one another you
[42:44] know what God did he just set up the
[42:45] pieces and walked away from the board
[42:48] he's like do whatever you want
[42:50] do whatever you want to it
[42:52] this this this works by laws that you
[42:56] are only you are only going to operate
[42:58] to to achieve what I've already said in
[43:01] Emotion
[43:03] hallelujah it's a beautiful picture if
[43:05] you want to take your Bibles and look at
[43:06] it these things I'm sharing with you
[43:08] very quickly because it could just eat
[43:10] up so much time how the the son of man
[43:14] in his kingdom is gathering at all those
[43:16] things that offend and we see sown in
[43:19] Genesis 3 right back out in 21 and 22.
[43:24] now
[43:26] I want to give you a micro
[43:28] sermon
[43:30] no sermonette because I ain't a preacher
[43:32] at
[43:33] I'm gonna give you a micro sermon
[43:35] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[43:38] and the Earth
[43:39] John 1 when in the beginning was the
[43:41] word and the Word was with God and the
[43:43] Word was God
[43:44] I'm wanting you to think
[43:46] of and think of it I think this helps
[43:48] this is the way I began to look at it
[43:50] and help me I've got to think in terms
[43:51] of Christ
[43:54] that this one Christ
[43:56] that if I could see him in this then I
[43:59] would recognize that there's something
[44:01] about Christ that transcends because
[44:04] here he is he's standing there before
[44:05] before Abraham was I am
[44:07] right so that that transcends that's
[44:10] something that's Transcendent that means
[44:12] Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ is even
[44:14] something Beyond this Jesus of Nazareth
[44:16] because Paul says have I not met Jesus
[44:18] Christ Our Lord this is after that body
[44:20] has ascended on high so and when I begin
[44:23] to think of God wanting to make himself
[44:25] known and now Christ becomes this
[44:26] expression of that in the beginning God
[44:29] created the Heaven and the Earth in the
[44:30] beginning was the word and the Word was
[44:31] with God and the Word was God we
[44:33] traveled down several verses later and
[44:34] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[44:36] us and then we see in Revelations 21
[44:38] verse 6 I'm just bringing this to this
[44:39] and he said unto me it is done
[44:44] it is done
[44:46] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[44:51] the end
[44:52] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[44:55] and the Earth in the beginning was the
[44:56] word so now as these things are set
[44:58] forth no more curse no more death and
[45:00] this descriptions being given I am Alpha
[45:03] I am Omega I was in the beginning I am
[45:06] in the end let the Heathen rage all he
[45:09] wants to let the devil think he's
[45:11] winning battles let him sow all the
[45:13] tears he wants to I'm the beginning I'm
[45:15] the end I spoke in the beginning I'll be
[45:18] the one that remains an end let up let
[45:20] the chipmunks chirp all they want to in
[45:23] the end I'm the one that lasts
[45:26] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[45:28] the end and I will give unto him that is
[45:30] the thirst of the of the thirst of the
[45:33] Fountain of the Water of Life freely
[45:36] he's the beginning in the end he's the
[45:37] Alpha and the Omega
[45:40] he's the the root and offspring
[45:44] so in Christ is the mystery of God
[45:45] revealed when you read in the beginning
[45:47] God created there is Christ
[45:52] from that to the Amen in Revelations
[45:54] every word testifying of Jesus Christ
[45:59] when you read in the beginning there is
[46:01] Christ so when he puts that forth as
[46:04] Christ we say there is the original
[46:07] spoken word of God that is what God is
[46:11] and we realize you're in in him this is
[46:13] what God is setting forth Christ is
[46:16] represents a king of a kingdom there's
[46:19] this embodiment in his person and who he
[46:21] is and I can say that brother Bradman he
[46:24] preaches Christ the mystery God revealed
[46:26] that Christ is the mystery of Heaven he
[46:28] was there in the beginning but he's
[46:30] hidden from Satan if I could even put it
[46:32] this way that he that he laid it out in
[46:36] such a way that Satan was very quick to
[46:37] try to pervert God's program but God hid
[46:41] him
[46:42] God hid it from Satan because Satan
[46:45] didn't pervert that he didn't pervert
[46:48] the tree of life he was after it and he
[46:51] saw something in heaven that the woman
[46:53] represented so he went after her but God
[46:57] had you hidden in Christ who is the Tree
[46:59] of Life
[47:00] and Satan was trying to get to you and
[47:03] got to the woman
[47:05] Hallelujah but God all along kept the
[47:09] original
[47:09] [Applause]
[47:12] so the seeds of the Kingdom they're all
[47:15] in Genesis chapter 1. they're all in
[47:17] Genesis chapter 2. what if spoken cannot
[47:20] return void
[47:21] the Perfection must come
[47:25] now in Luke chapter 1 verse 20. I don't
[47:28] even know if I have some of these things
[47:29] in here because I just wanted to go
[47:30] through them quickly
[47:34] I believe it's from Zacharias
[47:36] doubted
[47:38] and and you go find where brother bam
[47:40] said this over and over and over again
[47:41] mostly in the mid 50s
[47:43] he said Thou shalt be dumb the angel and
[47:45] thou shalt not speak until the day that
[47:46] these things shall be performed this is
[47:49] the phrase of brother Branham uses
[47:50] because I believe it's not my words
[47:51] which shall be fulfilled in their season
[47:57] and look begin to look that up in their
[48:01] season
[48:02] in their season in its season there is a
[48:06] season God can speak his word and that
[48:08] seed is sung whatever life is in there
[48:10] it's got to come forth but it must
[48:11] happen in its season and the church age
[48:15] book he teaches that Christ is the
[48:16] perfect and complete thought expressed
[48:20] and it was manifested in its season you
[48:23] had glimpses you had foreshadowing but
[48:25] then it manifest in its season and the
[48:28] Rapture Brothers says God's word is
[48:29] original it's the word it has to bring
[48:32] forth It's Kind it's Genesis 111. it's
[48:35] kind in its season elected predestinated
[48:39] by the father
[48:41] it's all these things that God spoke in
[48:43] the beginning these seeds of the Kingdom
[48:45] we read that they ultimately come to
[48:48] their perfect maturity and their
[48:50] permanent Eternal maturity in
[48:51] Revelations 21 and 22 in the in the amen
[48:55] they're forever going to be because
[48:58] God's words must come to pass they must
[49:01] be it shall be fulfilled in its season
[49:04] so consider if I could say this the
[49:06] kingdom implications and for for heaven
[49:10] for Earth
[49:12] and listen the threefold purpose of God
[49:15] are the threefold purpose of Christ
[49:17] because if you come to that it's Christ
[49:20] you and Eden or if I could say this the
[49:23] Earth
[49:25] that he had a purpose in these things he
[49:28] had something he was wanting to
[49:29] accomplish something that he was going
[49:30] to achieve
[49:32] and so the seeds of the Kingdom they're
[49:34] coming to their fruit they're coming to
[49:35] their manifestation in the sermon the
[49:37] Mighty God unveiled before us
[49:39] he says now okay I'm going to stop
[49:43] let me take a deep breath
[49:45] I want to pick up I want to pick up on
[49:47] this
[49:48] I bet so I'm just gonna I'll let it I'll
[49:50] let you pull me wherever you want me to
[49:51] go with this
[49:52] but
[49:53] these really you know what I'm gonna do
[49:56] I'll have to ask the musicians to come
[49:58] that way everybody's gonna be like oh
[49:59] okay we're soon we're stopping
[50:03] but I want you to focus and musicians if
[50:04] you're able to multitask this would be a
[50:06] great time to do it
[50:07] now the word of God is a seed
[50:10] if I could even Orient you to what he's
[50:12] preaching here
[50:13] the date June 29th I guess that would be
[50:16] we'd be on an anniversary tomorrow
[50:18] and that's not what I was thinking about
[50:19] I was thinking of that wonderful summer
[50:21] of 64. and these things that brother
[50:23] branham's preaching and all these things
[50:25] that are leading up he's going to preach
[50:26] future home and he's going to be
[50:28] preaching all these tremendous messages
[50:29] he's breaking forth such important
[50:32] critical things in this season now the
[50:35] word of God is a seed and it can't bring
[50:37] forth
[50:39] until the sun strikes in
[50:46] go ahead think about it a little bit
[50:49] God speaks it in the beginning
[50:52] and he lays out all the material
[50:56] and he puts it all in there and you're
[50:58] still coming forth but somehow by Divine
[51:01] ordination that that the seed got to
[51:04] bring forth predestined by the father in
[51:08] its season and their seeds that are
[51:11] laying there that keep oh that just keep
[51:14] getting passed on
[51:17] I keep getting if I could just use that
[51:19] terminology until it lands in the ground
[51:22] in the season for the manifestation and
[51:25] it cannot manifest unless the Sun the
[51:30] son strikes it
[51:32] the sun has got to be upon the seed to
[51:35] make it bare to make it come forth
[51:38] Hallelujah then in this hour there's got
[51:41] to be an s-o-n rise
[51:43] there's got to be an s-o-n shine
[51:46] that's the only way you take the word
[51:48] take the word of God in your heart and
[51:50] walk into the Shekinah Glory and then
[51:52] when you do it'll bring so bread Manor
[51:54] that's the only give to the separated
[51:55] people the only thing that can eat it
[51:58] that's permitted to eat it it's just the
[52:00] people who are permitted and knows it
[52:01] and this is I kept reading it because
[52:03] this phrase Paul said changing from
[52:04] glory to glory you see finally it comes
[52:07] till it's back to its original
[52:11] Glory
[52:12] and I say Glory
[52:16] it's got to come back to its original
[52:18] Glory
[52:21] but it takes the sun to strike it now
[52:23] you recognize how important it is what
[52:25] the opening of the word it is the rising
[52:28] of the Sun what why it says you're
[52:31] laying in the presence of the sun to be
[52:32] ripened to bake all the greenness out
[52:34] and I think maybe we start thinking in
[52:36] terms of getting the greatness out but
[52:38] really what it is is it's this life
[52:40] coming into fullness
[52:42] it's Life coming in
[52:44] life manifesting
[52:46] so in the sermon it is the rising of the
[52:49] Sun
[52:51] it says the first light
[52:53] was ever given and the Earth was God's
[52:55] spoken word
[52:58] I I'm I'm using this to close the
[53:01] service this evening but I want to come
[53:04] back to these principles in this the
[53:06] first light that ever struck the Earth
[53:07] was God's spoken word he said let there
[53:10] be light and there was light
[53:12] that turned Darkness into light
[53:15] in order to bring forth the creation of
[53:17] joy and life upon the Earth
[53:20] are you entering into that just Channel
[53:22] yourselves in the beginning the creation
[53:23] then the spirit of God hasn't moved with
[53:25] love and compassion
[53:27] that great day the first day of the dawn
[53:30] of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose
[53:32] and swept across its rays and dried up
[53:34] the waters on the earth and made an
[53:35] atmosphere above
[53:37] and for its first time
[53:39] it was to bring joy and life to the
[53:41] Earth by a seed
[53:45] and he said that was a great hour
[53:48] you found it
[53:50] but oh it wasn't nothing
[53:52] wait what
[53:54] oh it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like
[53:58] sunrise on that Easter morning
[54:01] okay now that first time is amazing
[54:04] right the first sunrise
[54:07] the first the beauty that it swept out
[54:10] and began to bring all these spoken word
[54:12] seeds forth but he's saying oh it's
[54:14] nothing like the sunrise on Easter
[54:17] morning
[54:17] this time with the sun leaping into the
[54:20] skies it brought forth a greater Sunrise
[54:23] than ever
[54:26] in other words oh Hallelujah the first
[54:30] Sunrise when it came up the devil's whoa
[54:33] look at that I could never do that
[54:35] that's beautiful
[54:36] and God's saying that even that ain't
[54:38] even going to be needed in the end
[54:41] are you with me
[54:44] oh that's beautiful God said just wait
[54:45] till the sun rises
[54:48] and he says oh that sign went leap
[54:50] disguise it brought forth the greater

[56:17] what's gonna happen when the son Rises

[56:42] Hallelujah
[56:44] blessed be the name of the Lord let's
[56:47] pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord I
[56:49] just closed this with an amen
[56:53] with an amen that your word is true it
[56:56] is eternal
[56:57] Lord that these sayings are so vast
[57:02] that that I I admit I'm often reminded
[57:06] that's that was a lot that was a lot
[57:08] there was a lot there and Lord I I don't
[57:11] do it because I'm trying to challenge
[57:12] the people and I realize that maybe
[57:14] naturally our capacity is limited
[57:18] but I'm not just speaking to natural
[57:20] people
[57:21] I trust that as I preach the word
[57:23] there's Ray beams
[57:25] that there's beams of light that are
[57:27] being projected to seed and that the son
[57:30] is shining as Christ is preached and if
[57:33] he be lifted up it's going to draw draw
[57:36] out the life that is laying and the
[57:38] people that are here in your presence
[57:40] this evening and Lord I pray that as
[57:43] they have come and as they have heard
[57:45] the word that if they conceive
[57:47] themselves in the word of God tonight
[57:49] they would claim your word for whatever
[57:52] they have need of
[57:53] [Music]
[57:54] a lot that would they would find that
[57:57] you begin to permeate every thought
[58:00] and that in that Lord it would begin to
[58:02] become the buffer to our Humanity
[58:05] and when we find ourselves instinctively
[58:07] wanting to quit something inside of us
[58:09] pushes us Beyond it we find ourselves
[58:11] wanting to fire back a missive Lord we
[58:15] find ourselves something resisting that
[58:17] Lord why because I'm living under the
[58:21] laws of a greater Kingdom I'm being
[58:24] drawn and magnetized to something Beyond
[58:26] myself so Lord I pray May the so wind
[58:29] keep shining May the son keeps shining
[58:33] Lord may this great sunlight that's been
[58:35] revealed to us in this end time may it
[58:37] keep shining upon these seeds because
[58:39] it's bringing forth children of your
[58:41] kingdom
[58:42] Gathering not just the subjects but the
[58:46] the attributes of your kingdom to you
[58:49] Lord
[58:50] bless us tonight I pray that you bless
[58:52] your people Lord as we worship may you
[58:54] draw near to our hearts bless us with
[58:57] your presence
[58:58] oh how we love you father you're so kind
[59:01] to us Lord
[59:02] we ask this in the name of the Lord
[59:04] Jesus Christ amen
