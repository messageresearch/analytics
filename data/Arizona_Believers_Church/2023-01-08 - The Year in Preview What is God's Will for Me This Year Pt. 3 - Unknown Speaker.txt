TRANSCRIPT
========================================
try to jump right into this here at the outset and emphasize a few things at the beginning and hope that uh you can take a step further in this question this year of what is God's will for me and I want to at the beginning Express uh just how it's a preview and it's because God has laid certain things out for us and he's laid out a path and if God told you the path that you should take this year if you take it then you have the year in preview you know what it holds for you know things that are coming up and last Sunday we dealt a lot of with the concept of free moral agency or agency and making a choice and looking at how that we have an opportunity of choice with respect to many things in our lives that God has Sovereign and God has ordained certain things and God has said certain things will be and there's nothing we can do to upset that but in the obtaining to that and even the benefit we get from that God gives us a lot of different choices and Wednesday night we touched on how that our spiritual growth and maturity is demonstrated in the the specific choices we make or the deliberate choices we make and we can claim to be spiritual we can think that we're mature but just look at the choices you're making and that's going to tell you whether or not there's real spiritual growth or even emotional maturity and whether or not there's been this development and we touched on how that true success if we're going to have true success it's contingent upon following God's will for our lives and that we should not have any other measure of success other than whether or not we're in his word if we want to know whether or not we're being successful we look to his word we want to know whether or not we are in his will we look to his word and that's the measure of success and our success will come from fulfilling his purpose in our lives now if you turn to Romans chapter 9 I'd like to read verses 19 20 and 21 and in reading this I would like to uh add another layer to the concept of will are having our own will God's will God's sovereignty even our agency and this is just touching on this very quickly before we move on and Paul is talking about how God chooses and how Jacob I've Loved um and he that's the one that he's Chosen and even before anyone had acted or done anything right or wrong he has already made this choice and so he kind of anticipates the objection when somebody realizes that God's the one that determines things and God's the one that chooses and so what is somebody going to say if God's got it all planned they say he says then we'll say thou Wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault why does he judge us why does he condemn us for who hath resisted his will that's his his purpose desire his determination and it is a good it is a good observance that oh who has resisted his will if God has determined to do something who is it that's going to keep God from stopping it and if this is what is Dawning upon the person that God is uh when he makes a determination he has a will who can resist it it's it's kind of put this way in light of God's sovereignty why would he still hold us accountable as free agents if he's the one that determines what happens and he's the one that says what I'll become and he makes me this way for his purpose and he hardens hearts for his purpose why would he still hold us accountable so it's actually a very intriguing question but Paul doesn't even answer the objection it doesn't try to fall into it and try to unpack this and describe that but he just points right back to God's sovereignty and he says nay but o man who art thou that replyest against God it may seem like a good question but he says who are you to even question God so it's a shall the thing forms say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel into honor and another under this another under dishonor in other words we have no right to strive against God's Providence we have no right to fight against his desire and so my takeaway from this is if God has determined it to be so and it's fruitless to fight against it then the best thing we can do is yield to it the best thing we could do is choose it and accept it and say Lord if this is what you want instead of just constantly question it trying to figure it out trying to make sense of it what I can do and what would be best for me to do is to accept your will and humble myself to it in a way choose it identify it choose it then embrace it to say Lord this is what I want this is I I want to follow in your perfect will and as we touched on to the last two services and I'm going to bring them up again because we're still our goal is kind of to expand expound more upon these things is there are measurable things that we can outline as God's perfect will for us and we've been using kind of the start of the New Year everyone's saying well what's what am I going to do this year what's my bucket list what what are my resolutions what did I want to accomplish last year and what did I accomplish this year I remember one time a couple years ago we bought a state pass to attend go to an Arizona State Park and we said to ourselves we're going to go to as many state parks as we can this year and you want to know how many we ended up going to right you buy the one and you we're gonna do it we're gonna buy we're gonna buy a map that has all the state parks on it with a nice sticker that you could put in over it when you visit it and you don't ever put one sticker on it why because you have a plan we're going to do this this is what we want to do this year this is what we want to accomplish and we don't quite get it done but the new year affords is a chance to reset and say this year we're going to visit all the state parks and what I want to say though is what we can do is say I want to be in God's will I want to know what this year holds I want to know what I should do this year and his word tells us very obvious simple things that are his will that we can choose and we can do and know we're fulfilling his purpose Wednesday night we touched on the fact that we spend less than five percent of our times in church and as little as zero percent or twenty percent in giving to the work of the Lord and and so those things that we talked about on the first Sunday are a real small percentage of the of our lives so if he said well these you only want to do these things and they relate to church then there's still a large percentage of our time that we should account for and so Wednesday night we touched on these three things sanctify your home gather around the word and live for others these this is the God's will for our homes this year this is God's will for our life These are three things that we can do and in doing it know that we're fulfilling God's purpose for our lives we can sanctify our home keep our home Sanctified gather around the word and live for others those are things that we can do outside of church that are God's Will and these are things that church ought to support you in give you the resources for him but last Sunday I want to bring these three back up to us and then I'm going to move on from it but this is my target are these things that these are the this is the will of God for you I can say this just without any hesitation this is the will of God for you this year assemble yourselves together which attend church contribute your tithes and offerings and support missions these are things I think we should be reminded of constantly this is God's will for you these are the things that you can do to be fulfilling God's purpose for you and there's essentially six things that we've been able to lay out here that we could say you could do these and you know you're in God's will do these and we know that you're fulfilling God's purpose for your life and the Beautiful part of this is these things are constant these are things that we you can identify as the plain path that God has put before you and a world with so many choices and with so many decisions that we're having to make and a lot of things that we're still trying to figure out whether or not it's God's will right there's a lot of decisions we have to make well maybe I'm the only one that's got a lot of things that I pray about and I'm not sure what God's will is but I would think that all of us have several things at any given time we're praying about whether it's not whether it's God's will to do something and it's not like we can just turn to the book of jobs and it tell us what job to take right it's just not in it it's just not there to tell us sometimes explicitly what we can do so there's a lot of things we're praying for uh that don't relate that cannot be specifically identified explicitly in the word of God but there are some things that are explicit in the word of God that are our constants that we can identify that are that we can be certain are his will and these are things that we're looking at as being his will now if you look turn to the book of haggai I'm going to start with verse 3 and we're going to walk through these verses that we just read and I want to use what is taking place here as a type of these three things or these six things if I could put it that way and the number of things that we could clearly lay out in the word of God as being his will but the focus in this book is God's Temple and if you look at it historically the foundation had been laid uh 14 years before and a little bit of progress had been made in establishing the temple and rebuilding the temple but it had been laid laid wasting and in an unfinished state so they go there with much enthusiasm they laid the foundation uh maybe a little bit of progress made but basically almost 15 years has gone by and nothing more has been done but they could say oh we laid a foundation oh we've made it back we're no longer an exile and they're back in in Jerusalem and so the word of the Lord comes to kind of shape the people who in laid a foundation and there's a lot here to think about the foundation had been laid but there had never been anything added to there had never The Next Step had not been taken and in verse 3 it says then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses in this house lie waist now that phrase there the sealed houses is it speaks of wainscoting and paneling and so it's it's it's furnished it's got crown molding and a nice plaster and it's not just it's not just a place to live it's not just a shelter from the elements they've actually gone in and made it not just comfortable but filled with conveniences uh not just something to get them out of the the elements or a place where they could lay their head but where they could do it luxuriously and so the Bible and use in this phrase the sealed houses is wanting them to identifying that they had time for leisure they had time for Comfort they had time for conveniences and they were able to fill up their house with a lot of nice amenities uh is even as it says you dwell in sealed houses they had time to wainscoat their kitchen they had time to put bead board up in their master bathroom they lined them with Boards of Cedars what some say they would have used and despite the hard times despite the conditions of them coming back from Exile and the things that they face they figured out a way to make sure that they had all the latest and greatest in terms of amenities and Technologies and enjoyments and Recreations in their home and then it says but this house lie wasted they dwelled in these houses indulging themselves in luxury and ease and idleness but then the house of God laid neglected the foundation had been laid but nothing else was done to build it up so here God is recognizing that they're enjoying a lot of things in this life and had a lot of things that they could say hey we didn't have this in Babylon and didn't this great and God's blessing us but there was something that was God's will that was being left alone and not being attended to and that's what God wanted him to think about so he says this in verse 5. now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways the phrase is literally set your heart upon your ways start thinking about your ways and I think it's plural there because it wants you to consider what you have done what you are doing to think about not just your actions but even your sufferings to say set your heart upon your ways is wanting you to kind of take a big big look at everything and the path that has led you to where you are now what you are doing now and Ponder earnestly whether or not you've sought selfish things at the expense of God's will I brought you out of Babylon I bring you back to this place and my desire was that this Temple would be rebuilt and so much of their lives would have centered around the establishment of that house in the house of God and this is what God wanted him to do this is why they're coming back is to do this and when he says consider your ways think about your manner of life and how you're living and whether or not you're just merely indulging yourself and not doing what I want you to do consider whether you're prospering and even as we read in verse 6 whether or not there's any evidence that you are that God is not pleased with what you're doing he said whether or not there's any evidence of God's displeasure and the question consider your ways let me just back up for a moment it would be asking the question of examine your manner of life the common ways of life your what you labor in what your Recreations are what you consistently and constantly engage in and now I I do not want for a moment for us to start settling into the thought that I'm going to begin I'm just giving you a history lesson I'm wanting you to examine Yourself by these words so that that's obviously where I'm going to get so he's challenging them in that time what are you doing why are you doing it uh what's the purpose in doing it and and if there's any look at your what you do consistently look what has the preeminence look what it is you're laboring to achieve and and how you're Furnishing your home and how you're dressing yourselves and and how things are laying out what you consistently engage in and ask yourself whether or not is this really the evidence of prospering and being in God's will or are there other signs that God is displeased because it comes to this in verse six you have sown much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you clothe you but there is none warm I I want you to think of it in this way that no matter what you get you're still a little you're wanting a little bit more you so much and you bring in little because you're not getting out of it what you want you eat but you don't have enough what is it it's this insatiable appetite to acquire to have you drink but you're not filled and you clothe but there's you're not warm you're always pursuing it's something that never quite satisfies and tells you this is good and this is right and and I'm happy with how I feel he says and then I think this phrase is just perfect and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put them into a bag with holes and and it's not it's not implying that someone literally has a bag with holes in it or a wallet with a hole or a bank account that's been hacked but rather it's saying that you labor and labor and labor but you're never able to store up it's what you earn you get it departs from you rather quickly and you're not able to really enjoy and you're not using that wage in a way that prospers you because it's just fleeting and goes away and these are very profound statements and he's doing it to ask the question are your difficulties and your struggles and these things that are happening due to your neglect of the house of God are you not satisfied with your drink are you not warm with your clothing are you not happy with what you're reaping and is it because not because you're not sowing enough not because your clothes aren't warm enough not because you don't have a high enough salary but is it because you have not done what God wanted you to do with respect to his house so it comes right back to it in verse 7 thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways Ponder for yourself and I would say for ourselves also consider your ways he revises it think about your ways why is it you live in and be boarded Wayne's coded finally uh uh amenities in your home and live luxuriously live comfortably and live at ease but yet my house is forsaken he says consider your ways and then he gives them some more things to think about and revisit and says consider your ways and I'm thinking for ourselves this is what we ought to be doing today and then he continues in verses 8 to 11 and we'll just finish up this reading and we'll come right back to it once we start making it applicable to ourselves go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house that would be a that would be labor and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified saith the Lord you you look for much and lo it came to little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it there's labor there's things coming in there's a harvest but it's not quite satisfying not quite meeting the needs not quite what we want why saith the Lord of hosts because a mine house that is waste and you run every man into his own house this isn't a Prohibition to going back home after your work this isn't a Prohibition against having houses it speaks to the mindset that that was most what was most important were just the natural things and the house of God which was important to them and God's will for them and a purpose of their dwelling there in Jerusalem they laid it let it be and delay in waste and had not attended to it therefore the heaven over you stayed from doing the Earth the state from her fruit this is why there's not as much blessing this is why there's not as much enjoyment and I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labor of the hands why because they had neglected the house of God God had told them to build up the house of God to put their resources now to God bring this Dwelling Place of God back to what was fit for God and what he desired and not that they would leave all those other things undone as Jesus would have said to the priest and the high priest and the Pharisees all these things you ought to have done and not left the other undone right so we ought to do them all not just kind of create well I'll do this and I'll do that I'll do this and I'll do that but he's saying that if I could put it this way it wasn't it wasn't to God he wasn't upset that they had nice wains coated in their house wood paneling if that makes it easier for some people to think about what that is I'm thinking Wayne has a coating now it's not that there's uh God wasn't displeased with that but it was what was missing that was the source of God's pleasure displeasure is they had left off the the building of the house of God and so these are the things God is saying because you've left off this the heaven has stayed from do the Earth estate from a fruit I hope you can just get that image in your mind that God is withholding blessings because they weren't doing all that they could according to his will and what they knew was his will now I'm going to transition to make it relevant today and I'll say this I'm wanting to draw make a direct application of these scriptures to our lives but I do not believe I can make an exact comparison of God's house to this church and this building and I'm not going to pretend that I can use haggai chapter 1 to tell all of you to start selling all these nice things you have in your home and put it into the building fund so that we can actually build our own church and we can have a church big enough for everybody and things like that I don't I think that would be misusing this scripture to use it strictly just about this church and this building but there is some application and type that can be made to our lives that would relate to church and relate to other things in our personal life and I would say that what we can glean from this the fundamental I could say the first principles in this is they were forsaking God's will so instead of turning this into a fiery sermon on upping our donations to the building fund I want to use it in this way to challenge us that in their particular situation their home their their lives were full of things to keep them busy to rest make them restful to live luxuriously to live comfortably and yet they were laboring they were getting increase and they were harvesting there's a lot of things taking place in your life that you can glean from these few scriptures but what wasn't being done was God's will right specifically for them it was getting the lumber and the materials together and rebuilding the temple so now what we can do for us is instead of saying oh does this mean we need to build a church do we need to build a church no what we need to do is do God's will that's what we need to do we need to do God's will it would make no sense to not know God's Will and not have have any of these six things that we've mentioned before down and down pat and then just put all our efforts in Building a Church it would be fruitless it would be vanity we would just be doing what a lot of people do we might as well just redenominate become the fifth Baptist Church of Glendale or something and try to get in line for some financing they'll buy us the land and they'll build us a church If all we're interested is having a nice building but our interest is in the things of God our interest is in a man's relationship with the things of God and his relationship to God and so if we could distill it down to the most basic element they were forsaking God's will God had promised him Prosperity God had promised them rest God had promised them some of the very things they were trying to enjoy but they were not doing what he wanted they were not following in the path that God had had for him so the book of haggai we could put it this way as the word of the Lord comes and rebukes Israel for living in nice houses while God's house is wasted and so I believe that this is an admonition and an instruction that become can become a practical principle for our personal lives so let's begin with the thought of consider your ways Ponder your path is what it's saying think about the direction you're going if you Ponder your path you look at how where you've come kind of the Meandering of your path which way you're taking so it's good kind of to look back a little bit look at where you're at look what direction it's sending you what manner of life do I have with my what are my habits what is the way that I'm living we can say what path am I pursuing if I continue down this course what does it look like a lot of times you're just living kind of in the moment and we say well he's a present tense God I just want to live in the moment that's great but God is also the god of the future right he is yesterday today and forever so God just cannot be the future cannot be abandoned so we look at ourselves and if what path am I pursuing if I continue to do what I'm doing now what is it going to look like and that's what the ant does right is it thinks about what the future is holding so it gets to work and it does things and the scripture talks about the sluggard just a little folding of the hands just a little bit of rest and thinks oh for the moment what I really need is a nap but it doesn't think about what the tomorrow's holds and what the demands are going to be and therefore it finds itself in ruin so we're looking at consider your ways there I would have saved that it challenges us to think about what our priorities are challenges to think about what our goals are what where what conduct have I been engaging in that's led me to where I am right now because what God was doing and I I wanted to maybe amplify this to Greater detail but I'm just going to narrow it down to this and just touch on Vision just a little bit God was correcting their vision he was challenging them about their foresight he was questioning their Prudence he's saying you've done a lot and you've and you've established a lot of things but you're not taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture you're not looking at things uh the right way you're living with the wrong priorities you're living with the wrong goals and he says it this way to me in verse six hang out chapter 1 verse six let's look at it again you have sown much in bringing little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you clothe yourselves you clothe you but there's none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put into a bag with holes these are all consequences of not pursuing God's will they're making efforts I would say that there's they're sowing uh there's there's something to drink there's something to eat there's something to close themselves with there's those that are earning wages so it's not that they didn't have anything but their efforts were not being blessed and God is at the at a minimum identifying that you're living way below your privileges that you may be happy with this life but I'm telling you it's not the full life you could be leading you're living way below your privileges and he's saying in order to be truly blessed in order to truly prosper and be happy you have to get your priorities right and you have to start putting your mind and your energies and your efforts into towards God towards God's Will and he's saying these things are fine but your emphasis ought not to be on these things because by emphasizing them you're actually minimizing them no matter how much you think in your mind you're getting something out of it by emphasizing it you're minimizing it but if you'll just emphasize me I can maximize the very things you no longer emphasize I don't know if I need an organ behind that or not but there's things that we are choosing we're failing to give priority to and by giving priority to the wrong things the very things that seem to be the greatest necessity are becoming the greatest curses and are failing even to meet the needs because you're not putting God first and this is the lesson that we take from haggai this is exactly what God is telling Israel in haggai and I think that as they were kind of living lasciviously and living according to excess and and having their own little laodicean moment we need to think about our lives in the way that we're living and we need to shake ourselves and we need to live deliberately that we ought to live deliberate Christian lives we ought to live lives that are that are captivated by the things of God and that when we have a vision of what we think uh God's will is for our lives we have a vision of what God wants you to be as a Christian then we live deliberately according to that vision and if we have that listen to this way if we have the idea that if we want to be healed we set a body before us and we by faith walk into that body then I think we could think about the kind of Christians that God wants us to be the kind of homes that God wants us to have the kind of character that God thinks we should have or that we want to have and we should have a vision of that and by eyes of Faith begin to make steps into it the Bible says in Proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision that vision is divine Oracle where there is no divine revelation the people perish now I know we like to think that that means they just die and they disappear but it means they live scattered lives they live unrestrained there's no discipline where there's no divine revelation people just do whatever they want and this is why we are where we are today in America this is why we where are we we are today in the world is there is no absolute truth there is no Divine Oracle there's no agreed upon Revelation and every man could just live to themselves so everybody just scatters they live unrestrained they live undisciplined and so where there is no divine revelation that people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he what is what is the proverb done it's tied together divine revelation and the word he that keepeth the law happy is he consider your ways it's saying what's the path for your life what's the path for your family what's the path for your home what is it you're doing where there is no vision where there is no divine revelation and we know that faith is a revelation of God's will and so that we we if we want to live by faith we have to live by a revelation of the Divine will of God it's not just living with believe and you can have whatever you want and we say oh that's a life of Faith just name it claim it whatever I want it's just going to have the power of Attraction the power of Desire the power of expectation living by faith is living with a supernatural revelation of the Divine will of God for my life and that's how I can live by faith where there is no vision where there's no revelation of God's purpose that's when we live undisciplined inconsistent lives but happy is he that keepeth the law true contentment satisfaction and security comes from being in God's will and I would say the lesson in haggai is don't prefer convenience and triple enjoyment over the will of God it's like your homes may be nice and you may be running back to your house because it's a fun place to be and all you got to do is walk in the door and say okay Google turn on the lights okay Google play my favorite playlist okay Google turn on the stove okay Google get a waffle out of the microwave into the microwave and you just all of a sudden everything's just doing whatever you want you can just set the mood right some of us have it towards voice activated moods when we walk into our bedroom and everything's just right and we lounge and we sit down and everything's great and we don't even have lights in the house of God [Applause] but that's how we how we live everything is just custom ordered is that we ought to think more about God's will than all the convenience and Temple enjoyments of this life because if we're going to have real comfort and continual temporal temporal enjoyments we need to put God first think about that this is where the devil tries to get us oh if you serve God you can't have any of that or if you put God first you can't have it if you pay your tithes you're not going to be able to pay your rent pay your rent you pay your tithes you're going to have a mortgage hey you keep paying your tires the mortgage can be gone I'm so worried that if I pay tithes I have to turn in my leased car you're gonna own your car you pay your ties these are the things that God promises these are things that God has said so sometimes the devil puts in our mind it's an either or proposition either choose God and be poor or just keep living comfortably and just write out the recession and when things get a little bit better and you're making a little bit more you can put more time into things of God you don't have to do that the devil's lying to you because listen real enjoyment real comfort and even the things that are temporal will last longer when you put God first I really and the way it said in haggai really if we don't put God first anything with joy enjoys just going to a bag with holes anything we gain or achieve we do something and we're not quite as warm as we want to be I mean listen we all we've all been there and done that we've ordered something we bought something we were really really excited about it we planned a vacation we went to eat some whatever it is and then when you do it you're kind of like I mean it's nice but it didn't change my life like I thought it would like some of you who went to Rito's you're like I mean it's good but come on every service mentioning it right there's just something that lets you down a little bit it just doesn't that just didn't do for you like you thought it would now is a sense of dissatisfaction and you're just not quite satisfied if you can look back in your life and see a series of moments and events like that instead of keep chasing the dragon and trying to find that high that satisfies I would think Lord you're the only one that can give me that type of enjoyment you're the only one that can give me that type of satisfaction and I promise you if you put him first you'll enjoy things in this life much more [Applause] you keep wondering why you come up empty why this doesn't hit you know why because God wants you to recognize something's out of place proverbs 4 25 and 26 says let thine eyes look right on and let nine eyelids look straight before thee this is what we ought to do we have a vision we have a goal this is about having purpose about being deliberate Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established think about where you want to be recognize the path it's going to take to get you there and fix your heart on that course Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established plain firm it's exactly what he's saying in haggai consider your ways this is an imitation to review cause and effect he's saying all right think about it think about where you are think about what's happening and what you're doing and what you're getting out of it what you're not doing and the impact it's causing is ask them to consider sowing and reaping and I wanted to get into a little bit of being proactive and maybe that concept of being proactive in our lives to where we're willing to put in the hard work now to reap a benefit in the future and I just think that that may be a sub thought that's worthy of more time but let me say it to you this way we should be forward-looking we're living in the now but with the now we think about what this is going to result in in the future and we're thinking about what we're doing now but how we're conducting ourselves how we're conducting ourselves presently what that looks like in the future if I project this forward in Galatians chapter 6 verses 7 to 9 we read verse 9 last time last Sunday let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we'll reap we shall reap if we faint not but says be not deceived this is the principle that it's built upon be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall reap of the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that saw it to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be wearing while doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not whatever you reap whatever you sow you'll reap this God is Not mocked it's the law of the Harvest it's the law of sowing seed it's the every seed bringing forth of its kind whatever you're sowing is what you're going to be reaping if you sow to the flesh you will reap of the flesh if you sow to the spirit you shall reap abundant things from the spirit this is the law this is what God is wanting to think about when they're earning a wage and putting a bag and it so quickly Falls away he said look at the consequence of Your Action you cannot continue to sow to the Flesh and think that you're not going to reap corruption you cannot think you can continue to sell to carnal things and that that's going to last forever those things will come to an end there's a lot of things we've put our faith in a lot of things we put our confidence in and we were just we were just getting lucky and we ride it out as long as it can and it all falls apart we think where did I go wrong where did I go wrong we go wrong when we leave out God's will I mean I hate to put it this way but your Luck's gonna run out listen how again this is the the consider your ways of just amplifying consider your ways First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 32. if after the manner of men I have fought with beast at Ephesus what advantage it to me what advantage it me what advantage is it to me if I'm just fighting with Beast after the manner of men if this is just a carnal fight it's quite a statement I fought with beast at Ephesus what good is it for me if the dead rise not you notice how immediately Paul puts things in perspective this chapter 15 is the Body Change chapter and he said there is no advantage to my labor if I'm not pursuing the proper goal if I'm not thinking about the future if I'm not thinking about God's promise if I'm not thinking about the resurrection if I'm not thinking about the Rapture if I'm not thinking about God's will for my life then it's no advantage to me to do all the things that men should do why should I fight if there's no resurrection and this is his conclusion if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die they say well I'm not actually I haven't quite thought about that but when God loses his place we immediately and instinctively fall into just feed the flesh eat drink sleep repeat we're just doing the things make sure I have money to buy what I want to eat make sure I have money to buy what I want to wear make sure I have money to pay for the car to get me to the place to make sure I have money right so I can go home and sleep so I'm good enough to go back to the place where I can make this money and we just get back in that same cycle right the same cycle of just living shampoo lives lather rinse repeat we've read the bottle if you follow it explicitly you run out of shampoo in the first setting because you allow the rinse repeat lather rinse repeat it never tells you when to stop and that's kind of the lives that we live we live shampoo lives we're just always waking up doing the same thing and Paul's saying hey if this is all this life has got for us if there's not a Hereafter we're not looking for a city if there's not something that means more than natural things if there's not a supernatural God present that has called me to serve him and do things for his kingdom then I might as well just eat drink and be merry for tomorrow I die this is a recalibration of our vision this is thinking differently about God's will for our lives and if I could say this as Paul places it if we don't have a appreciation of the future then we live aimlessly where there is no vision divine revelation Divine Oracle if there's not some understanding of what God's will is for our lives we live unrestrained we live undisciplined if we don't understand the future consequences of our present actions then it doesn't give real weight to our present actions if you knew you could do something and he would only hurt for just a second and immediately afterwards there's no scar there's no permanent injury there's a lot of things unions be doing trust me if you knew that you could jump off a cliff and it would only sting for a moment when you hit the water even if it's 150 feet some of you would just do it and I know that because some of you do do it and so the the lower the pain threshold and let lower the consequences are I'm kind of a scaredy cat I mean I I wouldn't jump off a cliff into the water if it was just 12 feet like I don't know that just doesn't seem like a fun idea I've never got the idea of a haunted house or scary movies why would I want to be scared hey I just don't get it so if you think about the idea of lessening the consequences that what I go through now that has no future impact now what I'm trying to say is the less we are aware of the potential consequences the more risky we live the more unrestrained we live and we don't give any consideration oh if we oh my landlord will never kick me out or they'll never come and repossess my car if you're not worried about consequences you'll live financially undisciplined you'll live nutritionally undisciplined whenever we lose sight of the future we lose the weight of the moment is lost and the importance of what we say and what we do is lost that's why sometimes we say whatever we want to people treat them however we want and do whatever we want because we've completely lost awareness of the consequences of our behavior and what it looks like when it's projected into the future and so we ought to we know God is a present tense God we live today but God is the god of the future he's the god of tomorrow and we've got to think about the present tense I know this statement has it makes a different point in terms of the emphasis but in the sermon come follow me I I what I mean is it's making the point about how much we ought to pour into our children and train them but think of how he's saying this youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow he says we must train them Lord so the this is these are the people for tomorrow so you can say oh well we look out on the congregation we see uh all these young people and all these young children oh this is their church it's going to be their church one day but he says we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow so could you imagine that if we acknowledge that the in the future the young people today these are the future deacons there's a future Pastor there's future trustees this is the Church of the future but we give no thought to how that we're training them right now for that future so he says we must train them today not tomorrow we don't wait till they're in that position we don't wait till it's more imminent we begin to do things now so that it would make it easier for them to fulfill God's purpose of their lives later I think it's just too easy to undervalue the present especially in terms of what the future holds and and when brother Brandon says well we need to train them we must train them when we feel the burden to train them why because their success tomorrow is dependent upon what we do today their success tomorrow is built upon the foundation we're laying today consider your ways Ponder the path of thy feet so that your ways will be established look your eyes right on the eyelids look straight before thee I want to bring this in just very quickly in Psalm chapter 40 verse 2. he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the myri clay and set my feet upon a rock there's so much that you can identify in the book of haggai even of how that their of a Salvation a foundation being laid an anchor point and I I read I wanted to read this because I believe that many of us can testify he's brought me out of a horrible pit he brought me out of a miracle he set my feet upon a rock he's established a foundation but then there's an and established my Goings there has been something steady there has been something persistent there's been something there's been progress met and established my goings remember in the sermon power of transformation as we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have then now we want our minds to the mind of Christ to have that preeminence in us I'm just paraphrasing and the transformation of our mind to do the will of God into the perfect will of gods and eyes this is what we can say I've been saved I've been set free I've been delivered I have salvation oh God did this for me 15 years ago God did this for me and we have that Blessed Assurance we have that anchor but God wants to establish every footstep oh then he establishes our goings if he wanted to distill these things down to six things let's just make it a seventh the first one is be sure that you're born again in other words know that you have received that blessed seal of God and you have that anchor down inside your soul and you've been sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if we have been sealed as we have then we know what God's will is for our lives because we look into the word of God and we see it plainly laid out before us and we want we're taking this moment here at the onset of this year this first week of the year to think about the path that we're on and when it says you've established my goings I I think I want to touch on this in Greater detail but it was it kind of caught me this way of what what kind of Rhythm are we in I was a Cadence to our lives right there's a routine some people are very habitual and their their coffee maker is set to make coffee at a certain time because they're going to be up and it's going to be hot perfectly made from a certain time and you can always predict where they are any given moment because their creatures of habit and they and their discipline and so there's a rhythm to people who are very disciplined but there's also a rhythm to people who aren't disciplined and you'll find that there's certain things that they make sure they always do and enjoy and reach for and grab and do and accomplish and succeed in even if they don't have other areas that are more fruitful beneficial you'll find there's a particular Rhythm to their lives and I'm asking us to think about what is constant in our life and and I'll just kind of throw this in here for the sake of the neighbors that live in the apartment next door foreign how The Addictive nature of so many things that are in our lives and by virtue of being able to place a device within our within our presence that is so easily accessible and portable I remember years ago I mean I I guess I could just share a little bit of a testimony when I was in law school all I did was I got up early and went to class and studied all day and I went and always ate like a 3 000 calorie lunch at a place called Bubba's that had like fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy right there in Dallas right by the law school I am just putting in a plug for them a pretty good I don't know if they're still there and then I wouldn't eat again so I think I ended up like going into diabetic Comas after that and I'm going to drag myself out of the car to go study or go to my afternoon class and I got so unhealthy and I prayed and asked God I said God you I need your help and so to make a long story short I walked into a nutritional place and I mentioned I asked him about something and he said well what do you want it for I said I need to lose weight instead sit down he preached me a sermon and uh and he talked he's talking about uh he said there's three things you look for in a meal taste accessibility and calories and you like that maybe we could maybe we hit on that because if you're going to stay disciplined it needs to taste good but it needs to be accessible and it needs to meet your calorie threshold and I caught a revelation and I did it and it works and but the thing was The Taste accessibility and calories the accessibility of things and if you don't think the world has caught on to how the human mind works and it's got just the right taste for it it's just accessible and it's got just knows just how to feed you to keep your energy for it going and somebody think what in the world is brother Aaron talking about I mean is it the games I play on my phone foreign is it the dick of nature some of these dramatic series that are released all the time and you just keep hanging on the Cliffhanger you got to see it through binge watch when the season's over you re-watch the season before come on somebody right I think it should be said I think it should be mentioned because a lot of us are really good at making sure we always and you know what you know how I know this because you let your kids play one game at night you know at three o'clock they gotta they gotta get on the iPad because they got to open the crate right they're releasing some new character right come on and some of you people think you're laughing at your kid you're laughing at yourself because adults are addicted to it too it wouldn't surprise me if some bathroom breaks haven't been because of zuba or whatever it is or fantasy football I can say it because it's week 18. congratulations to Preston he won the league of some brothers in this church he won the Super Bowl congratulations to pressure these are things we ought to think about we're thinking about how that we can always make room in priority for certain things and maybe because I thought well Brethren you can't equate it it's so easy well I wonder why it's so easy I wonder why it's so easy to do all these other things and why it's just a little bit harder to do these other six things who do you think's made it that way in what reward do you get in these other things right you're the queen bee in the New York Times spelling bee congratulations you solved Wordle for the first time in two weeks right what is it that you get out of it what what kind of enjoyment it's a bag with holes in it but these other six things that are really really hard to keep up with you haven't stopped to think about the Eternal benefit and reward that comes from it and the cascading effect it has within families within homes within lives there's things that ought to have a greater priority in our lives so the Bible says in haggai chapter 1 verse 8 I want to make this applicable for us I think I'm just going to hit my my way home here on this it says go up to the mountains and bring wood and build the house make the choice do the hard work he didn't say go to go online and order two hours Amazon Prime Lumber he's saying go up a mountain cut down trees trim those trees drag them down the hill trim them up and lay them the way you want to this is a quick sentence to say do the hard work labor for the house of God labor to do the will of God I know it's not going to be easy you're going to have to climb up a mountain chop down a tree carry it down shape it and fit it but do my will built the house that's what I'm telling you to do today build the house whether it be your spiritual home whether it be the atmosphere in your home whatever it might be in these six things I say build your house in other words do the will of God and he says and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified labor for the right things make the sacrifices because it's worth it this isn't an investment in a church this is doing God's will this is letting the word have preeminence brother Branham in the sermon looking for Jesus he said he's the center of our worship the center of our attraction the center of our life all that we have and want and are will be is based upon him all that we have and want are and will be is based upon him this is the way that ought to be where Christ is our aim where our first priority is doing the will of God we could spend time just outlining what priorities are and I say that there's in some maybe it's a corporate corporate culture a certain um processes they have something that's a governing priority this might be it might be this way in coding where there's something that takes priority and I'm looking at my coders you know like okay all right we're good and it's something that this if this then that type stuff right but there's something that is the main it's the governing priority that's going to rule this sequence it's the governing priority that you measure everything else by it's a priority that governs your conduct and determines one's actions you'll find this in certain settings where say at the end of the day this is our goal and whatever you do whatever you uh uh say or do or however you treat a situation it's got to meet this and if it doesn't you need to consider it and reevaluate it until you understand how that it does and I believe that in our lives we ought to have a governing priority in that governing priorities Christ he's the chief Captain he's the Supreme he's the one that we're considering and so we evaluate all our choices all our decisions all our Ambitions everything by whether or not it meets this governing priority think about how easy it is for other things to gain the preeminence for other things to have the impetus for the squeaky will to get all of our attention in the Greece and then we leave Christ alone and we're not doing his will oh I'm just asking you to consider your ways I'm just asking to think about what God's will is for your life I can be absolutely certain about things that are God's will for your life and I'm just saying consider your ways does everything fit that governing priority what is God's will for me this year I'm a attend church contribute times and offerings support missions you say when are you going to stop mentioning I may never stop mentioning these three things because these are three things this is what churches these are things that relate to what we do we should never lose sight of them I'll always keep our minds we must assemble ourselves together we must be contributing our ties and offers we must be supporting missions it wouldn't do us any good for all of us to stay home and say well if I'll just use my gas money towards missions and we just all stayed at home right and supported missions no it's we got to do everything let me run through three statements very quickly just to show this is God's Will and the sermon possessing all things he says our heavenly father thou has chosen that we should gather together that we should gather together it's the will of God that we should assemble ourselves together as we see the day approaching and that regularly sometimes we think that church is for the preach and the word and it is and so we think that as long as I'm hearing the word I check the box about church but if the assembling together it's the will of God that we should assemble ourselves together as you see the day approaching and that regularly Lord to bring ourselves closer to you and closer to each other I ain't ever felt close over a zoom call and closer to each other in a bond of Fellowship through the shed blood of Jesus which makes it possible it is the will of God that we should assemble ourselves together and the sermon Israel and the church part four brother if you paid your tithes and done what God said for you to do you wouldn't have these old suppers and things like that it says amen even the anointing oil jumped off on that I wanted to go back and listen to it I think maybe the anointing oil fell over and jumped off he says he said I hit something even the anointing oil saying amen if you paid your tithes and done what God said for you to do and doTERRA said amen you wouldn't have these old soup suppers mlms pyramid schemes hus side hustles and things like that he said even the anointed all jumped off what I said let me tell you something brother God wants a church that moves at a Divine will of God based upon thus saith the Lord amen that's what God wants is a church that moves in the Divine will of God based upon thus saith the Lord and a part of that is if you paid your tithes and done what God said for you to do why because that's God's will and then the end time sign he says you're doing God's will when you give to missions you're doing God's will when you give to missions these are just three quick statements I can throw out you say these things are God's will doing these things demonstrates that you have an understanding of God's will and not that you just haven't understand God's way you have an understanding of This Promise that's contained within these things and that God has a process that he unfolds for the people who do his will if you could think about it this way as I tried to use vision as a part of this when you attend church on a Sunday morning it's not for Sunday morning right it's for Monday morning right you don't just come to church for them for the morning it's for tomorrow when you contribute it's not for something passed churches in a debt snowball we're trying to catch up and pay off something no this is making this is something for the future the same thing in supporting missions if you support missions and you really do it with an understanding you're visionary because you realize that we that when that last that sheep that comes in that there's a work that God needs to do in every individual member of the body of Christ's life and when we support missions we value that last Soul that's coming in we value the minister that's going out on a maybe a motorcycle and driving for hours to go out into some remote place to establish the message in an area that's never been and established the word in places it's never been why not because we just want to use it for uh fundraising and not just thinking we do it because it's just some sort of tradition or habit do it because something anchors in your heart to realize there's something valuable in that there's something precious in that there's something wonderful that God is doing there's something God has accompanied anyways that if I can make an investment in missions if I can support missions then it can have an eternal Eternal impact listen if we pray for missionaries if we can find the financial ways to support missionaries to build churches and to support missions we may never shake the hand of the Evangelist we may never shake the hand of the missionary we never baptize a convert we may never visit another country but one day in eternity oh Hallelujah to see the reward that you people will have because you had a vision that it matters and it counts if we can say these things are the will of God brother Brown says when you find the will of God don't let nobody talk you out of it when you find the will of God don't let anybody talk you out of it I'm I think I'm making this pretty easy for you I've given you at least six things you shouldn't let the devil talk you out of is another place that's what we do you must first find the will of God before you can do the will of God you must first know what his will is in the matter and then don't turn it loose there's things that we can grab a hold of Maybe re-grip and take a hold of and say Lord I know this is your will and I'm going to fight for it I'm going to go up this mountain I'm going to cut down a tree and I'm going to bring this log back and I'm going to put it in the house I'm going to go up this mountain I'm going to cut down a tree and I'll bring it down and put it in this house I'm going to build the house I'm going to build the house I'm going to keep laboring I'm going to keep working I'm going to keep gutting it up I'm going to keep trying amazing there's a saying I can't remember now just who it is it said I kind of use it in a different way but it's uh and I wish I could remember the person that's one of the old-time Believers God's will and his time will never lack for provision God's will done right God's will done in his way will never lack for resources you know we can't say we can't say that for us right I I like last night I tried to play a game of 21 with my boys I thought I was going to pass out right no matter how much I want to I get winded there's a limit right here but there's something about doing God's will that when when you're just about to run out he always provides when you're just about to run out God always provides when you're not sure if you can make it God always provides but you got to set your face towards it if you're going to make the conscious decision to not do his will you're never going to tap into the resource that can be available to you when you purpose as a family I'm going to do God's will I'm going to do this I'm going to do it because I know this is God's will I'm going to do it because I know it's right I'm going to do it because I know this is what God wants for me and despite all the opposition knowing that it might hurt knowing that It Might Sting knowing it's going to be hard I'm going to look at that mountain and say God this is what you want me to do you want me to go up this mountain I'm going to go up this mountain I'm going to cut down a tree and I'm going to bring it back and I'm going to put in the House of God I promise you that when you make that determination we're talking about you consciously choosing the will of God embracing it and sending yourself to do it God will give you God will give you the Instinct God will give you the ambition sometimes what it takes is just for us to make the decision and mean it and not turn loose of it [Applause] I want to close with the story of the Widow of Zarephath God dealt with me uniquely on this yesterday and I just feel to close with this story in First Kings chapter 17. verses 10 to 16. and so Elijah has now he had been sustained By Ravens and brother Branham even says in one place that's the the ministry but there came a time when Elijah had to go to a widow of Zarephath a place of purging this woman represents the bride we could use such a spiritual type of the Bride so he arose and went to Zarephath why because God told him that there he had ordained a woman there was a bride there's a bride you say well how in the world is this message continued because God raised up a bride to sustain it that's why we're here she arose he arose and went to Zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there the widow woman not just a winner woman the widow woman was there Gathering sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink now I know your most of you if not all of you are familiar with the story there was a drought this was a very significant drought it was a drought that was leading people and people were dying as a result of this drought it's because of the drought that the Brook Terrace dried up and God had to take Elijah and move him to seraphat because there's no water so there was one resource that was probably the most precious at this time and it was water and it's the first thing God asked for right he says go and get me a little water and what I think what's so beautiful is verse 11. in verse 11. and as she's going to fetch it no objection water you want water you could ask for anything but water why would you ask for the thing that's the most precious why would you ask for the thing that ain't coming a long time why would you ask for water it's the one thing that we're praying for but she's almost instinctively without even thinking twice about it she goes to get the water and as she's going to get it he said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand so now he's really getting not only does he want water but he wants bread these are the things that would be the most scarce without water there's no grain without grain there's no bread the cascading events of a drought the cascading events of this dire situation that had come upon him and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of mill in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and now here's just her honesty and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die Now you kind of get the full weight of just how bad the circumstances were that it was such a terrible drought that there had not been any way to grow grain or crops that she'd come down to where she had the last little bit of meal and the last little bit of oil enough to bake a cake and feed it to her son and she knew this would be their last meal she knew they would be drinking their last little bit of water usually the last little bit of oil last little bit of meal and that this is I don't even know if we really can fully appreciate just how she must have felt in this situation I know that my son and I are going to die now parents can put themselves in desperation this is the reality of her situation and she's doing what a mother ought to you know she's going out Gathering the sticks and she's going to uh make the little fire she could heat up the oil and take the meal make it into a cake and bake the cake and then eat it and it'd be their last meal and then wait for death to come and Elijah said unto her fear not it's the first thing he wants to do it's called my fears go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall The Crucible fail until the day that the Lord senteth Reign upon the Earth that's quite a promise but notice the the position of things that watch was necessary for her survival but now there's a message that comes and says listen do do that but first give me do this first and then do this and if you will do that you'll be able to do this in perpetuity you'll be able to keep doing this you're doing this as your last meal but if you do this first the oil will never run out the meal will never run out if you do this first I will provide all the oil all the grain I will provide everything you need but if you'll just do this and some of us just keep scraping we keep scraping we keep scraping just do this first just keep God first [Music] it says and she went and did according to the saint of Elijah she went and did what did she do she put the prophet first she did what he said first put that word first she and he she and he and her house did eat many days and the phrase is so beautiful and the barrel of milk wasted not neither did the crucified oil fail according to the Lord which he spake by Elijah what a challenge to our priorities what are what a challenge about the necessities and what's more important does not the Bible say I've esteemed your word more necessary than meat I believe that if we just go about accumulating resources and using them they'll run out but if you put God first he can bring an unmeasurable benefit in him unmeasurable whatever our labors are whatever our your salary your wage what you're earning what you what you give your children the shoes you buy realize when the children of Israel were March into the promised land The Souls of their shoes never wore out I know there's an extreme that people can put this to I know that there's a way that maybe maybe it's termed Prosperity preaching and I know that maybe even the way that I'm phrasing it could be uh maybe a little I could be a little bit more careful in the way I'm saying it you say well brother and I do everything I know I'm supposed to do and I still struggle keep doing what you know what you're supposed to do it don't change because you're trusting God in all of it and the way that God dealt with my heart I'm just going to read a statement to close how I just want to close with this and then read a quotation from Hebrews chapter 2 part 2. we ask God to speak we're desperate to hear his voice some of you have prayed Lord if you if I just could hear you speak on a situation if I could just know your will know your mind if you'll just tell me what to do we've purposed in our hearts that this year is going to be the year that and we speak very particularly with God and we express to him how you know I don't I don't like the way things have been and in in this expression of wanting God to speak and for God to come on the scene and do something we want things to change something needs to be different can't keep going like this and we're asking God to speak and what I'm telling you this morning he already has I know this may be very particular to somebody a particular very specific and I'm not saying that by prior knowledge I'm saying it as the Lord speaks to my heart somebody if you're if you're we want God to speak we want God to speak but I'm reminding you he already has if you want His blessings if you want his leadership if you want things to change I want this to be the last year that this happens I want I don't like this I don't like there's all these things that maybe we're considering if we want things to change he's already told us what his will is in the year in preview if you put God first to talk about a preview if you put God first he'll make provision for the year's demands this is what Elijah was doing for this woman he was given her year in preview if you just make me a cake first your oil will never run out and the the the meal will never run out that was a preview and brother Branham picks it up in Hebrews chapter 2 verse part two let's remember that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever confirming his word we must do it oh please do it take heed let every other thing be secondary even your home your husband your wife your children whatever it may be put it second place God first you say brother Branham over my children over anything and this to me is really challenging because there's a lot of decisions we make in light of our children or because of our children or for the sake of our children and we're not thinking that it's it's not even what's best for our children because it's at the expense of putting God first over anything Place God first let him be first Elijah come off the mountain one day he was an angel a messenger God's messenger anointed and he found a widow woman picking up two sticks he said go back and bake a little cake and fetch me a little water and she said as your soul liveth I have not just enough cakes or enough wheat dough to make one little pancake and I just have enough oil to go in to mix it up for shortening and I'm picking up two sticks think about this dire situation and then Elijah says and she said I'm going to cook a little cake for me and my boy and my baby and we're going to eat it and die there had been a drought for three years and six months no water anywhere that Stern old Prophet looked that woman in the face and said go bake me a cake first what a command for a man to tell a widow woman starve into death to feed him first what did he say for thus saith the Lord the barrel will never go empty nor The Cruise dry until God sends rain upon the Earth this was not I guess there's a way to look at this and maybe try to take play Deadpool's Advocate with this well how demanding that is of this prophet and how crude this is of God to do this but God wants himself to be made known in circumstances so he orchestrates things that may puzzle the the the mind of somebody who wants equality in the mind of the person who thinks what's fair but he does it to make himself known and we may think that Elijah was the object in this particular situation but really the Widow of Zarephath was because God had ordained the woman and she was to make him a cake it only says to make him one cake and if she made him a cake first it would never run out and so God provided a means to bless her [Music] it was really for her I think so much just forgive me I just feel to say this we can put so much emphasis in trying to lift up the voice of God and lift up the messenger lift up brother Branham and keep his message alive it ain't for brother Branham it ain't to lift up a man it's for the bride the reason why we make this Bible available the reason why we want the word to be available is not to lift up a man but it's for the person that the word is sin to it's for the recipient he says first God she went in and baked that little cake and come and give it to the prophet went right back and baked another one and another one and another and another and the barrel never went empty and the or the crews dry until God sent rain on the Earth listen now she put God before her children she put God before anything else she taken the kingdom of God first that's what she's demonstrating by this and you wonder well will there be enough resources there always will be it's God's will and he's obligated to look after it if it's your will to go climb Mount Humphrey and that's what you want to do Humphrey's Peak whatever it is that's what you want to do train train all you can prepare prepare prepare right put all the hard work and and you better make sure you take care of all the resources but if God wants you to do something he will equip you and he will make a way God must he says God must have first place in your heart first place in your life first place in everything that you do or what you are God must be first I know it seems really simple but this is the truth he doesn't want the second place he doesn't deserve the second place he deserves the best and the first and all that we got he deserves it Blessed Be His holy name this is the will of God for us this year he says not what men say what the church said but what God's will was all we need to seek the will of God not the favor of your neighbor not the favor of your children not the favor of your husband or your wife but seek the will of God do that first and here's the great lesson then everything else the will of the wife and the will of the children will fall right in with it but Place God first I love this challenge if there's been any reason why we haven't fully done what God wants us to do in these six areas if we haven't been embracing them and doing them and putting God first and fulfilling God's word in our lives and if we've been worried about what will happen to the kids worried about what will happen with the wife worried about what the spouse will think it says it right here that if you will put God's first the will of the wife and the will of the children will fall right in line with it sometimes the very things that you think will be the most resistant and be your opposition will become your greatest benefit and support when you begin to do what God wants you to do I don't know why I'm reminded it but brother Chris remember when he came back from that men's meeting that one year and remember he told she said I'm going home and I'm going to have to talk to my family we're going back over a decade ago and we're thinking wow he's going home God had got to hold him he said I'm gonna go back and make changes and I began to think in my mind oh my goodness this is going to ruffle some feathers this is going to be real interesting a few hours later I get a sister Elizabeth gets a text message from Sister Valerie she said you won't believe it the most wonderful things are happening God is doing the things amazing and all the boys are on board with it too and everybody was excited and everybody was ready to take that next step why because somebody stepped into their place somebody got in their position somebody said I gotta do what God wants me to do God first for my life everything else second even if it means my kids and my wife they say wow this is a misogynistic God no God knows that's what's best for your kids and your wife please God first let's stand
