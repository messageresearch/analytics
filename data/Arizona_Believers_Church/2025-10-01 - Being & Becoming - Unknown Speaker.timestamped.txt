[0:00] Ecciastes chapter 6 verse 9. Better is
[0:03] the sight of the eyes than the wondering
[0:06] of the desire. This is also vanity in
[0:09] vexation of spirit. Now we know the
[0:11] preacher here is uh riffing on a lot of
[0:14] things and identifying a lot of vanity.
[0:16] So he says better is the sight of the
[0:19] eyes than the wondering of the desire. A
[0:22] lot of things to consider there and I
[0:24] hope that you're able to do that. You
[0:26] can be seated.
[0:28] My title this evening is being and
[0:31] becoming and in using this particular
[0:33] title. Uh we'll get into it in some in
[0:36] some ways. I see a lot of continuity
[0:39] with what was ministered last week on
[0:40] the sacred trust and then you changed on
[0:43] Sunday on those concepts of growth and
[0:45] even this trust that God's put in us
[0:47] that we are to express his nature and
[0:49] his character. So I just see a lot of uh
[0:51] connection in those things, a lot of
[0:53] momentum that we hope that we can
[0:54] capitalize on. But using this phrase
[0:57] being and becoming, I'm I've been
[0:59] wrestling with the meaning of
[1:01] Ecclesiastes chapter 6. As in my Bible,
[1:03] it says the failure to enjoy blessings
[1:05] is the heading that's given to it. And
[1:08] I've been wrestling with verse 9 in
[1:10] particular because there's so much
[1:11] that's in this that really has caused me
[1:14] uh to just weigh it over and over again
[1:17] to see it from the right perspective.
[1:18] And so with this title of being, I'm
[1:21] looking at it from the standpoint of
[1:22] existence. If we say there's we're not
[1:24] necessarily a human being but just
[1:26] existence or the fact of existing or
[1:29] that which physically exists that would
[1:31] be even connected with the sight of the
[1:33] eyes. If you see something uh then you
[1:36] know that it exists. It can even speak
[1:38] here in these scriptures of what a
[1:39] person has. So better is the sight of
[1:42] the eyes and what a person has something
[1:44] that exists. What is it said that a bird
[1:46] in hand is better than two in the bush.
[1:48] Uh I hope I got that right. But that's
[1:51] means that what you have is better and
[1:53] the sight of the eyes. But then on this
[1:55] thought of becoming and this is where
[1:57] the real wrestling has been for me is uh
[2:00] becoming is that uh compound of be and
[2:03] come this becoming it means to change
[2:05] from one state of existence to another
[2:08] any process of change. Now when we begin
[2:10] to talk about change as believers or as
[2:13] human beings we don't are not inclined
[2:16] to like change. Change is often
[2:17] difficult. I thought the sermon on
[2:19] Sunday was so good on change and even
[2:22] acknowledging there's change for good,
[2:23] there's change for bad. But becoming has
[2:27] this meaning of any change from the
[2:29] lower level of potentiality to uh the
[2:32] higher level of actuality. So there's
[2:34] some potential there. And if there's a
[2:36] becoming, then you change from a lower
[2:39] level of being and you tr change to this
[2:41] that you realize this potential to a
[2:44] higher level of something that actually
[2:46] exists or is.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; And so there's in in this becoming I
[2:51] could see this wandering of desire as it
[2:53] says better is the sight of the eyes
[2:55] what you have than the wandering of the
[2:57] desire. It speaks to what a person does
[3:01] not possess. So you have the sight of
[3:03] the eyes and what he has and what he is
[3:06] versus the wondering of desire that
[3:08] which you do not possess but maybe want
[3:10] to enjoy or want to have. And I think in
[3:13] looking at that you could just see that
[3:15] there's it's a very it's a very
[3:17] interesting proposition and observation
[3:19] that the writer makes in Ecclesiastes to
[3:21] where it's better the sight of the eyes
[3:23] is better than this wondering of desire.
[3:26] And I'm wanting to look at this idea of
[3:27] your being, your existence, but then
[3:29] also this becoming.
[3:31] To look at this in greater detail in 1
[3:33] Corinthians chapter 13:1, I'll be using
[3:36] a few scriptures at the outset just to u
[3:39] kind of express what's in my heart in
[3:41] terms of this being and becoming. He
[3:43] says, Paul says, when I was a child, I
[3:45] spake as a child. I understood as a
[3:47] child, I thought as a child. In other
[3:48] words, he was a child. I when I was a
[3:51] child, I I acted, thought, and behaved
[3:54] as a child would. But when I became a
[3:56] man, I put away childish things. So in
[3:59] looking at this scripture from this
[4:01] perspective of being and becoming, he
[4:04] existed as a child. It was his life.
[4:06] That was his being. But then he says, I
[4:08] became or I changed to a man. There was
[4:11] a time when he was one thing, but
[4:13] through this process of maturity and
[4:15] growing, he became a man. And then he
[4:17] even says it in a way to where it's like
[4:19] this manhood that he came into
[4:21] transpired or he's able to achieve this
[4:24] higher level of actuality when he put
[4:26] away childish things. He changed from
[4:29] being a child into being a man. And this
[4:33] is going to be this is I think just
[4:36] foundational for what the Lord's been
[4:37] dealing with me on that maybe we'll get
[4:38] into more on Sunday. But I want to look
[4:40] at this personal and even parental
[4:42] responsibility we have over being and
[4:45] becoming. And I'm not trying to uh sound
[4:48] philosophical with that. I'm wanting to
[4:49] be very practical. But we have a
[4:52] personal responsibility of being and
[4:53] becoming. We have a parental
[4:55] responsibility of being and becoming.
[4:57] And I would say that we have some
[4:58] responsibility uh even as members of a
[5:01] church or as Christians in the sense of
[5:03] being and becoming. We have this
[5:05] personal responsibility over our
[5:07] existence over our lives. We can see
[5:10] that just you could put under the
[5:11] heading of a lot of scriptures and a lot
[5:12] of teaching in the scripture that this
[5:14] relates to your duty as a person and
[5:16] your duty as existing. And then also
[5:19] there's this responsibility over the
[5:21] process of what you're becoming
[5:23] &gt;&gt; and and it's it it's I think important
[5:26] to think about this. I think this is a
[5:27] very critical point of we could ask
[5:29] ourselves what are we or who are we and
[5:33] and looking at ourselves and saying who
[5:35] am I right now and and then also what am
[5:37] I becoming because you could probably
[5:39] look and say I know that I'm not what I
[5:41] used to be uh and and I know what I want
[5:44] to be but the question of whether or not
[5:45] you're going to get to where you want to
[5:46] be might have something to do with the
[5:48] fact that you can look back and say this
[5:50] is where I was or who I was this is who
[5:52] I am now and ask yourself is that even
[5:54] lining up
[5:56] &gt;&gt; if I'm wanting to be uh if I'm wanting
[5:58] to be something or become something,
[6:00] then uh what path am I on? And I'm not
[6:04] sure if these are questions that people
[6:05] ask themselves anymore. I think that uh
[6:08] you know there's maybe it was more
[6:09] pressing upon me when I was younger.
[6:11] It's like what are you going to be when
[6:12] you grow up and what are you going to do
[6:13] and what are you going to do with this?
[6:13] What are you going to do with that? And
[6:14] I think that maybe is impressed upon a
[6:16] lot of people at this stage of what am I
[6:18] going to do to make a living and where
[6:19] am I going to live and all these
[6:20] different things and I think these are
[6:22] good questions to ask. Who am I? what am
[6:24] I becoming?
[6:26] &gt;&gt; And in the sense of parental
[6:28] responsibility,
[6:30] there is just this uh it's implied in
[6:33] being a parent that there is some
[6:35] responsibility for bringing life into
[6:37] existence that as a as a mother or a
[6:40] father, you have responsibility for
[6:42] causing a being. But then also this
[6:44] process of what that life will become.
[6:48] that it's not just a matter of having
[6:49] children and then just kind of trusting
[6:51] it to the elements, but there is some
[6:52] sort of a responsibility over bringing
[6:56] life forth and then how that nature that
[6:58] we've brought forth, we have a
[6:59] responsibility over that. And then what
[7:01] kind of nurture are we giving it? What
[7:02] kind of atmosphere are we raising it in?
[7:04] What kind of parameters uh have we
[7:06] established for uh keeping that spirit
[7:08] clean and and uh cultivating positive
[7:11] character in their lives? And I want you
[7:13] to look at it from think consider it
[7:15] from this standpoint. not see it from
[7:17] this standpoint, but just consider it in
[7:19] that better is the sight of the eyes
[7:21] that there's something that we could say
[7:23] what are you exhibiting or demonstrating
[7:25] before your children in what is seen but
[7:28] then also what is desired because there
[7:31] is there is a something positive and
[7:34] tangible in what is seen better is what
[7:36] is seen but then there's this downside
[7:39] to the wandering of desire where
[7:40] something that's elusive and something
[7:42] that where they're just following
[7:43] feelings. So, if we're not getting into
[7:46] the nitty-gritty of this, I'm wanting to
[7:48] cause us to begin to think more about
[7:50] our personal responsibility of the lives
[7:52] that we're living and what is being
[7:54] expressed. As brother David said, that
[7:56] sacred trust, but then also what we are
[7:58] becoming, the change that is taking
[8:00] place in our lives. It does fit with the
[8:03] prelude, which is the act of sewing and
[8:06] what goes before something is
[8:07] manifested. And we use the phrase the
[8:09] kota or that finality that that coming
[8:12] together things in the end. is that
[8:13] sewing or the planting of the seed. But
[8:15] then ultimately what's harvested, what's
[8:18] the fruit? And if you're sewing a
[8:20] particular seed, then you have some idea
[8:23] that if it's successful, you know what
[8:25] you're going to get.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; So there's a prelude, the sewing of the
[8:28] seed. It's kind of forecasted and
[8:30] saying, "Hey, if all goes well, we
[8:32] should have a crop of grain in the end."
[8:34] It's a growth from the seed to the fruit
[8:38] uh and this process of reproduction. And
[8:40] that's kind of what we're looking at.
[8:41] What responsibility do we have in that
[8:44] process of being and becoming? Now, if
[8:47] you look at Genesis chapter 2:4, I want
[8:49] to see this being and becoming
[8:52] personified in God. It was just a good
[8:54] place for me to start tonight, maybe
[8:56] just to help me uh express is begin to
[8:59] express this burden. And we're going
[9:01] back to kind of the foundation and the
[9:03] roots in the first several services this
[9:05] year as we've been using this subject of
[9:07] the act of creation and art and been
[9:09] looking at it from these different
[9:10] perspectives. Uh these are some things
[9:13] just to use showing that God exemplifies
[9:16] this being and becoming. In Genesis
[9:18] chapter 2:4 it says these are the
[9:19] generations of the heavens and the
[9:21] earth. And he uses this phrase when they
[9:23] were created in the day that the Lord
[9:26] God made the earth and the heavens. And
[9:29] he uses a phrase of God in describing
[9:31] him as Lord which is Jehovah and God
[9:33] which is simply Elohim which is strong
[9:35] one. And we see that in the beginning
[9:38] God Elohim created but now he's
[9:40] characterized as being Jehovah God which
[9:43] is Jehovah is the self-existent one that
[9:46] Adonai comes from the Hebrew word hava
[9:49] which means to become to exist to become
[9:51] known and it speaks to this character of
[9:54] God that I believe we could identify
[9:55] very clearly in the word that God is
[9:58] continually becoming.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; He's a God that is called himself the I
[10:03] am. And so there's a being that he is,
[10:05] but then there's also this uh view in
[10:08] scripture where it says he was not yet
[10:09] known that way. So he's a god that's
[10:11] unfolding. He's unveiling himself and
[10:13] he's making himself known. And so God
[10:17] was that being. He was uh eternally
[10:20] existing. Yet inside of him were all
[10:23] these different attributes and powers
[10:25] and abilities. And so through that he
[10:28] became
[10:29] &gt;&gt; and because of that he became and I
[10:31] would say that he's becoming he's still
[10:33] unfolding himself and his being is
[10:37] immutable unchangeable it always was
[10:40] eternally existing and I remember when I
[10:43] was the age of uh maybe Jack maybe even
[10:45] Preston that when I begin to think of
[10:47] eternity I just kind of locked up and I
[10:48] got all scared because I couldn't
[10:49] conceptualize it. I was like this is
[10:51] just beyond me. Uh, and now I'd say that
[10:54] I just believe that eternity has been
[10:55] awakened in me and I'm not afraid of it
[10:57] anymore. But there's this God always
[11:00] being. There's no forward or backwards
[11:02] or up or down. But in him, in that being
[11:05] was a certain character. And God then is
[11:08] expressing himself in creation to where
[11:11] he's becoming even in creation. Creation
[11:14] itself testifies of who God is. Now in
[11:17] John 1:es 1:3 and this is just another
[11:20] side of Genesis 1:1. In the beginning
[11:23] was the word and the word was with God
[11:25] and the word was God. So God in the
[11:28] beginning this Elohim and now he is the
[11:31] word which is the Greek word here is
[11:33] logos. The same was in the beginning
[11:35] with God. All things were created by him
[11:38] and without him was not anything made
[11:40] that was made. This is God now uh
[11:44] becoming. He's the invisible God. He
[11:46] cannot be seen. He cannot be handled. He
[11:48] cannot be felt. He just exists in a
[11:50] dimension all by himself. That dimension
[11:51] was God.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; He was it. He was the only thing that
[11:54] existed. Elohim. But now when he begins
[11:56] to create, there's this unfolding of
[11:59] himself to where he gives there's some
[12:01] sense of dimension. Now it's no longer
[12:03] just God, but now there's some expansion
[12:06] to where he's expressing himself in a
[12:07] body or form that he can begin to create
[12:10] a a and have space and time and matter.
[12:15] Brother Brandon when he touches on this
[12:16] in question and answers and he does in a
[12:18] lot of different places he makes this
[12:19] statement the logos which is actually
[12:21] the attribute of the fullness of God
[12:23] when God became into a form to where it
[12:25] could be seen it was the anointing of
[12:27] the great spirit that went forth it's
[12:29] condescending coming down it's God
[12:31] becoming God all alone existing uh um by
[12:36] himself the strong one who then now
[12:39] expresses himself in a form from which
[12:41] he begins to create and as each thing is
[12:44] created Ed, they have a relationship to
[12:46] him as creator.
[12:49] And then as it said, the Lord God made
[12:52] the heavens and the earth. So now it's
[12:53] just not Elohim, but it's the becoming
[12:55] God. And he begins to express himself in
[12:57] relation to creation. And then John 1:14
[13:00] says, "And the word was made flesh and
[13:03] dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory,
[13:06] the glory of the only begotten of the
[13:08] father, full of grace and truth." What
[13:10] has happened is God in the beginning who
[13:13] forms himself and we see this expression
[13:15] of the word which is God now the Bible's
[13:17] saying the word was made flesh in who
[13:20] Jesus Christ
[13:21] &gt;&gt; and now he has not just stayed up in the
[13:24] heavens or in another dimension beyond
[13:25] this but now he's expressing himself and
[13:27] he's become the word in flesh
[13:30] &gt;&gt; right
[13:31] &gt;&gt; and God who was a being and has become
[13:34] and been unfolding himself yet the I I
[13:36] think is I've heard it phrased before
[13:38] and I thought it was really good the
[13:39] neverchanging, everchanging God because
[13:42] he's never changes but yet he's always
[13:44] unfolding himself.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; And so there's this pattern in God. He
[13:49] personifies this being and he's perfect
[13:52] in all his ways and his thoughts and he
[13:54] he's never made a mistake and all his
[13:56] thoughts are perfect and his thoughts
[13:57] are real and that are going to be
[14:00] materialized. But yet there's a pattern
[14:02] in God for us. There's something for us
[14:05] to consider that by birth we come into
[14:07] being and that there is still yet a
[14:10] becoming.
[14:12] look a little child when they're born, a
[14:14] newborn, and you say, "This is there's
[14:16] all life there, and you see all these
[14:18] elements of a human being, and you see
[14:20] all the features and all the the body
[14:22] parts, and even sometimes you could look
[14:25] back at the at a newborn stage and you
[14:27] can say, man, that personality that I'm
[14:29] now seeing in my toddler as they grow
[14:31] up, you can see it there even in that
[14:33] newborn stage that there was life
[14:35] there."
[14:36] &gt;&gt; So, they've come into existence there as
[14:38] a being, but yet there's still a
[14:39] becoming. And this is both to the
[14:42] natural and also to the spiritual. And
[14:45] we have responsibility over both.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; There's a responsibility that you have
[14:50] in your natural life to take care of
[14:52] your person. There's certain things that
[14:54] are best practices. And there's ways
[14:55] that you individually and personally
[14:57] ought to be caring for your existence
[14:59] and then how that existence impacts
[15:01] others. And then also the responsibility
[15:03] you would have as a parent over your
[15:05] child in bringing them into existence
[15:07] and that life that they have. But then
[15:09] there's also this responsibility in
[15:11] spiritually wherein you must be born
[15:14] again.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; That very first doctrine even as it was
[15:17] mentioned on Sunday that this is
[15:19] something that you must be changed in
[15:21] that way. You must be born again. So
[15:23] there's some element of surrender and
[15:25] yielding to that power to change. You
[15:28] can't change yourself but there's this
[15:30] acceptance that you do. So there's a
[15:32] responsibility in the spiritual sense of
[15:34] changing into a new creature or being
[15:37] and then becoming expressing the nature
[15:39] of that.
[15:42] Now
[15:43] I hope this is helpful to to use this
[15:46] nomenclature
[15:48] and to use this expression but I want to
[15:51] look at this difference between talent
[15:53] and skill. I'm only using these phrases,
[15:56] not that we would make a doctrine out of
[15:58] it. And you know, a few months from now,
[16:00] if somebody references skill and you're
[16:02] like, "No, that's false doctrine. I'm
[16:04] not sure you're using that word right."
[16:05] That's not what we're going for here.
[16:07] We're just trying to use uh these terms
[16:09] to express something here. So, I want to
[16:11] use talent in the sense of even in its
[16:14] kind of old etmology, this inclination
[16:16] or this disposition, this leaning like
[16:19] you have this you're predisposed to
[16:21] something that would be your talent. But
[16:22] then a skill is this developed
[16:24] proficiency or this developed facility.
[16:27] That's what I'm looking at when I say
[16:28] skill at talent and skill. And maybe
[16:30] these words are interchangeable in some
[16:32] respects, but I think I want to express
[16:34] it this way to there's something that's
[16:36] innate as far as talent. I think it's
[16:39] very critical for us to consider this
[16:41] especially in a spiritual sense, but
[16:43] then also having responsibility over
[16:45] your person and even over your home. We
[16:48] we need to be aware of there's a certain
[16:50] ability that is innate, but then there's
[16:52] also this development, right?
[16:55] &gt;&gt; And so talent is a special natural
[16:57] ability or aptitude, maybe even a
[17:00] person's uh collective ability. And so
[17:03] it's a natural aptitude or native
[17:05] ability. They have it essentially by
[17:07] birth. And I think you still have to be
[17:09] careful to where you're not all in on
[17:11] the fact that it, you know, it's genes.
[17:13] It's in your DNA. There's a lot that
[17:14] goes into it maybe uh naturally, but
[17:17] this idea of talent is this natural
[17:19] endowment or ability of some maybe we we
[17:21] might say a better quality or superior
[17:23] quality that they have a a talent for
[17:26] doing this or they have a knack for
[17:27] doing that. And so it's this marked
[17:30] innate ability or even in the sense of
[17:33] maybe an artistic accomplishment where
[17:35] they're they're able to do something.
[17:36] And I see that uh uh like in my daughter
[17:39] Eliza, she just has had this natural
[17:41] talent when it comes to drawing and I
[17:43] kind of just look at it from the very
[17:45] early stages. I'm like I don't know how
[17:47] this happens. You know, I got all sorts
[17:49] of things in my head and I'm like I am
[17:51] just going to start with the basic
[17:52] shape. So I'm going to do a circle and
[17:54] it's like this is very oblong or this is
[17:57] more of a pentagon and what what have I
[17:59] done? I can't quite get it right. Well,
[18:01] there's people that have that innate uh
[18:03] profic this artistic ability. And then a
[18:07] talent is even as we'll see in a
[18:09] scriptural sense and even as ita became
[18:11] to be used even with respect to
[18:13] Christianity and it kind of gained this
[18:15] meaning in vocabulary. It's a gift
[18:16] committed to one for use and
[18:18] improvement. This talent is something
[18:21] that's committed to you as a gift to use
[18:23] but then also to improve.
[18:26] So that's the talent is that natural
[18:28] ability or aptitude. But on the other
[18:29] side, we're looking at skill, which is
[18:31] this proficiency or even this dexterity
[18:34] that's acquired or developed through
[18:37] training or experience. So, you can have
[18:40] an aptitude, but then there's some uh so
[18:44] some improvement through training or
[18:46] experience. It's a developed talent or
[18:48] ability. Some of the cinnamon
[18:50] cinnamonss, I'm thinking of cinnamon
[18:52] rolls. Some some of the uh boy, let me
[18:54] tell you something about the Danish.
[18:56] They know how to make their sweets and
[18:58] everything else for that matter. It was
[18:59] quite the gastronomic celebration.
[19:02] But it is a some of some of the synonyms
[19:06] uh would be art or craft, an expertise
[19:09] or knowhow, a technique. Like these are
[19:12] things that you have to that are learned
[19:14] um that denote this great ability in
[19:16] doing or performing something that's
[19:18] usually or especially attained through
[19:20] practice, through study or through
[19:23] discipline. some things that people can
[19:25] do just by talent alone. But then this
[19:27] the skill would be uh uh how that they
[19:30] use that talent. So talent is what we
[19:33] may have by nature. But the skill
[19:36] develops from the use of that.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm using in terms of
[19:40] just talent and skill? Again, I'm not
[19:42] trying to have these uh these doctrines
[19:46] that are laid out there and well, we go
[19:47] to the skilled church or we you know, we
[19:49] do this. No, it's just a terminology to
[19:51] use to understand that there can be
[19:52] something innate in you by birth
[19:54] naturally and spiritually. But then this
[19:57] process of maturing and growing is as
[20:00] one becomes more skillful and you can
[20:02] see these terms in the word of God
[20:03] become more skillful with the word that
[20:06] that that that milk belongs to those who
[20:08] are being they have nature they have
[20:10] life but there's a certain word that is
[20:12] encouraged to and given to those who by
[20:14] reason of use or practice have their
[20:16] senses exercised or skilled because even
[20:19] that's what skill means in some it
[20:21] literally is discernment or wisdom.
[20:25] So there is a talent that we may have,
[20:27] but then that skill, we're born with
[20:29] talent.
[20:31] You should have all said, "Amen."
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're all born with talent. Uh
[20:36] even if it is just being able to eat
[20:38] cinnamon rolls, we're all born with a
[20:40] talent. But skill, think of this, skill
[20:43] is the employment
[20:45] &gt;&gt; of that talent. Yeah, sure.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; We can have talent and we can have gifts
[20:50] and we can have things that maybe are
[20:51] innate in us by birth naturally and
[20:53] spiritually, but there's a particular
[20:55] employment of that talent and we would
[20:57] look at that outside of the realm of
[20:59] just the talent. But now this is an
[21:00] expression and this is the employment or
[21:02] how that talent is used.
[21:05] One of our presidents, Calvin Culage, uh
[21:08] made this statement and it was much part
[21:10] of a broader uh point that he was
[21:12] making, but he said, 'Nothing is more
[21:14] common than unsuccessful men with
[21:16] talent.
[21:19] Quite the statement.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Nothing is more common, we might say
[21:23] nothing's more common than a fool or
[21:25] might you say that or or ignorance, but
[21:27] he says nothing is more common than
[21:29] unsuccessful men with talent.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Something to really think about. Yeah,
[21:33] &gt;&gt; this is a challenge even to us who claim
[21:35] to be born again that we have this
[21:38] divine within us and there's something
[21:41] that's been that has been quickened
[21:43] inside of us and that's unlimited
[21:45] potential
[21:47] &gt;&gt; that that's omnipotence that that that's
[21:49] something that's quite powerful but what
[21:51] are how are we employing it
[21:53] &gt;&gt; and what is the skill that is being that
[21:56] is being used or being expressed through
[21:58] the discipline the practice or the study
[22:01] &gt;&gt; and in the natural sense If one of our
[22:03] presidents could say there's nothing
[22:04] more common than unsuccessful men with
[22:07] talent and it's people who had innate
[22:09] abilities that weren't able to employ it
[22:12] &gt;&gt; to some success,
[22:15] then I think that applies naturally, but
[22:16] then it also applies spiritually.
[22:20] A lot of these things that we're sharing
[22:22] tonight are things that we've just been
[22:23] gleaning through the last several months
[22:25] on this idea of this role that we play
[22:28] in in being the art of God and
[22:30] expressing God's nature and character in
[22:33] the sermon the restoration of the bride
[22:35] tree and it's um actually it's the next
[22:37] statement I'm going to use here in a
[22:39] little bit that uh is very curious
[22:41] things that are being that he's
[22:42] referring to. But brother Bram's
[22:44] presented with the painting by a brother
[22:45] and he said that's very fine Jerry. It
[22:47] was a painting by Brother Jerry. Stephie
[22:49] says, "It's very fine, brother Jerry. If
[22:50] you're here this morning," he says,
[22:52] "It's too bad. Think of this. I want you
[22:55] to really let this weigh in on you. I
[22:56] wish I had the means to let that boy go
[22:58] to the school for an artist.
[23:01] I'm not ashamed of my liberal arts
[23:03] degree now." But he says, "I wish I
[23:05] could pay for him to go to school uh to
[23:07] art school
[23:09] &gt;&gt; or to hone this ability." Says, "I wish
[23:12] I had the means to pay for him to go to
[23:14] school to be an artist."
[23:16] And he says, 'I believe God is in art.
[23:19] God is in music. He says it again, God
[23:21] is in art. And all the arts here said,
[23:23] 'Amen. He says, God in this, and he
[23:26] says, it's too bad to see a talent like
[23:28] that wouldn't be developed.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; He's talking about painting.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Okay, he's talking about painting. We
[23:35] might be thinking, well, surely he was
[23:36] talking about how just the right way to
[23:37] lay your hands on somebody in a prayer
[23:39] line because those are the things we
[23:40] should get really proficient at. But
[23:41] he's talking about the an aptitude that
[23:43] someone have to draw. right
[23:45] &gt;&gt; this this this skill in the arts to be
[23:48] able to paint and draw things he says
[23:49] man I believe God is in art and I think
[23:51] it would be wonderful if this person who
[23:53] has this aptitude this natural ability
[23:56] to paint things and it's even Leonardo
[23:58] da Vinci is the one that said that
[23:59] painting the painter in in creating uh
[24:03] has an expression of the divine mind
[24:06] &gt;&gt; so there's something even to the the
[24:08] Greeks they they associated creativity
[24:10] with this divine power uh that there was
[24:12] this power in that that's coming forth.
[24:14] And so God being in art and God being
[24:17] the ultimate creator that when one has
[24:19] this ability to take what's in their
[24:21] mind, and I think this is what beautiful
[24:22] about all the artists we have here, and
[24:24] there's several, I'm not want to leave
[24:25] any artists out, but some may prefer not
[24:27] to be named, but it's incredible just
[24:29] how they can take something and produce
[24:31] it.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; And he says it would be bad to see a
[24:36] talent like that not developed. He says
[24:38] the more he does, the more developing
[24:40] he'll be. And he says, 'I pray that God
[24:42] will bless you, Jerry. Isn't that
[24:44] remarkable?
[24:46] That ability for art or creativity is
[24:49] something that one should cultivate.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; And it may seem, well, that's, you know,
[24:54] what what what's the use in being able
[24:55] to uh to draw? What's the use in be able
[24:58] to do that? It's an ability.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; It's a gift that should be guarded,
[25:05] &gt;&gt; should be valued,
[25:06] &gt;&gt; shouldn't be misused.
[25:09] There's a there's some thought that
[25:10] should be given to how am I employing
[25:13] this creativity.
[25:15] If God gave somebody the ability to
[25:17] write songs and play music, you wouldn't
[25:19] want to use it for evil.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; God gives you a gift or ability in art
[25:24] and creativity and drawing. Then there's
[25:26] a certain way that you can begin to
[25:27] express that talent that's not going to
[25:29] give glory to God, but rather to things
[25:31] of the flesh of the world. Amen.
[25:35] In
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:8 it says, "Wherefore he
[25:38] saith, when he ascended up on high, he
[25:40] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[25:43] unto men." In the the scripture these
[25:46] gifts being given to men, we know also
[25:49] later on in verse 12, he says, "And he
[25:50] gave some and he gives these gifts,
[25:52] these ministerial gifts." And so gifts
[25:55] are given by God. I'd like to use it in
[25:58] the sense that by nature
[26:00] but even in our natural birth there is
[26:02] this DNA there's this uh inclination or
[26:05] leaning that we might have just by
[26:07] virtue of nature a lot of factors that
[26:09] may go into that and then also by the
[26:11] new birth that there's gifts that we
[26:14] would have according to God's measure
[26:16] that he would give
[26:18] and in addressing Timothy Paul writes in
[26:21] 1 Timothy 4:14 to neglect not that gift
[26:24] that is in thee So there was a gift that
[26:27] was in him and he's saying don't neglect
[26:30] that gift but cultivate it. Don't
[26:32] disregard it. Don't let it go stale.
[26:36] This is something that I think we could
[26:38] say to any of us that might have some
[26:41] talent whether it be in poetry or
[26:43] whether it be painting or music that if
[26:44] you let that kind of go stale then and
[26:47] you're not using it then it there's this
[26:49] atrophy that begins to happen. And so
[26:52] when he says, "Neglect not that gift
[26:54] that is envy," that there was something
[26:55] he had to keep fresh and keep alive.
[26:58] And so he says in 2 Timothy 15, excuse
[27:01] me, 16, he says, "Stir that gift up." So
[27:04] in these two different instances, Paul
[27:06] is telling him, you have a gift, don't
[27:08] neglect it.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Don't let it go to waste. Don't let it
[27:13] become unused a and and paralyzed or or
[27:17] rusty. So he says, "Stir it up.
[27:20] Quicken that gift. inspire that gift
[27:22] that is in you. So he says in chapter
[27:25] 2:15, "Study to show thyself approved
[27:27] unto God, a workman that needeth not to
[27:30] be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
[27:32] truth."
[27:34] Now, we could take these scriptures and
[27:35] very specifically apply it to this gift
[27:37] of being a pastor or minister that
[27:39] Timothy had that Paul is saying that
[27:41] there's this gift that is in you that
[27:43] you have been given that you should not
[27:45] neglect it, but cultivate it and that
[27:47] you ought to inspire it by stirring it
[27:48] up. And so there's this process of one
[27:52] who has this gift to minister the word
[27:54] of God to where he keeps it fresh and he
[27:56] inspires it. He's looking for
[27:58] inspiration. He studies. He prays. So he
[28:00] says, "Study to show thyself approved
[28:01] unto God." So labor, employ that gift, a
[28:05] workman or a labor that God may see it
[28:07] and be pleased with it.
[28:09] I I'd like you to take that into mind
[28:12] and not just simply say, "Well, I sure
[28:14] hope Brother Aaron's, you know, not
[28:15] neglecting the gift and he's keeping it
[28:17] stirred up and I hope he's studying to
[28:18] show himself approved." I've actually
[28:20] been asked before, "Why do you study so
[28:22] much by a preacher?" And I'm like, "Am I
[28:27] do am I studying too much?" But really
[28:28] what they meant is why do you study at
[28:30] all?
[28:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, I was told one time, I'm just
[28:32] going to take your notes and rip them up
[28:34] before you get up there. I'm like, well,
[28:37] do your thing, right? I mean, if that's
[28:39] what you do, tear my notes up. It's not
[28:42] going to stop me. But I think there's
[28:44] some responsibility
[28:46] &gt;&gt; to study,
[28:48] &gt;&gt; to pray, to watch, to consider these
[28:50] things. And in the same, so let me just
[28:52] maybe finish this thought that as he's
[28:54] telling them, don't neglect it, stir it
[28:56] up, and study to show thyself approved.
[28:57] That a minister then is looking for
[29:00] inspiration.
[29:02] He wants to keep that gift subject to
[29:04] the word and subject to the presence of
[29:06] God. And there's a lot of things that go
[29:07] into that. And in the same way that an
[29:10] artist, I was thinking on these things
[29:11] lately about writer's block and these
[29:13] other things that people who engage in a
[29:14] creative process. I don't know what to
[29:16] draw. I hear that question quite a bit
[29:18] from my Eliza. What should I draw? And
[29:21] so I I found an app one time that would
[29:23] actually give you prompts to draw
[29:25] something. And uh that worked for a day.
[29:28] And then so but there's a way that you
[29:30] they're looking for inspiration. So,
[29:31] there's things that an artist should do
[29:34] to not neglect the gift and stay fresh
[29:37] and stay sharp. I imagine the same would
[29:40] go with a potter, one that works with
[29:41] clay. There's times when you you want to
[29:43] be inspired.
[29:44] You want to keep that gift active. And
[29:48] as we could see that maybe in a
[29:49] spiritual sense with the minister's gift
[29:51] uh maybe in a natural sense of these art
[29:53] create a creative arts but think of
[29:55] yourself
[29:57] that there's this responsibility that
[29:59] you have if we have the gift of eternal
[30:01] life if we have come into being if there
[30:04] there's something that we have by nature
[30:07] then there is a stirring up and a not
[30:10] neglecting and a studying to show
[30:11] ourselves approved a workman and a labor
[30:14] to where I'm not just being but I'm also
[30:16] becoming. Amen. Amen.
[30:19] Now, if you could let's turn to Matthew
[30:20] chapter 25
[30:22] for verses 14 to30
[30:25] and
[30:27] in re I'm I want to just read through
[30:29] this because this use of the word talent
[30:34] here in in Luke I believe it's refers to
[30:37] pounds but that was given me a complex
[30:41] to some he gave five pounds to others he
[30:43] gave 20 and 50 you know and it just uh
[30:46] makes you think a little bit differently
[30:48] about what pounds are. But then in the
[30:49] sense of talent that's used here in
[30:52] Matthew 25, it would be that gift that's
[30:54] committed to one for use and
[30:55] improvement. So it might be a play on
[30:57] words, but think of in terms of a gift
[30:59] or a talent, an opportunity innate
[31:01] that's given.
[31:03] And it says this in this parable of the
[31:06] talents. For the kingdom of heaven is as
[31:07] a man traveling into a far country who
[31:09] called his own servants and delivered
[31:12] unto them his goods. So now they've
[31:14] become stewards of something given to
[31:17] them. And unto one he gave five talents
[31:19] and to another two and to another one.
[31:21] To every man according to his several
[31:24] ability. And so this this several
[31:27] ability, it speaks of a a natural talent
[31:29] or capacity.
[31:31] And I think this applies in the natural
[31:34] that there's gifts and abilities that
[31:36] vary from person to person. Here one
[31:38] receive five, another two, another one.
[31:41] And there's no judgment there. there
[31:43] there there's no hierarchy necessarily a
[31:46] and there it's not creating this
[31:47] absolute stand well you need to have
[31:48] five you need to have two you need to
[31:49] have one but each man was committed
[31:51] something and there was a trust that was
[31:53] committed to them as Paul says in
[31:55] Corinthians that each one is given this
[31:57] measure of grace according to the gift
[31:59] of God and so he says and he straightway
[32:01] took his journey verse 16 then he that
[32:03] had received the five talents went and
[32:05] traded with the same and made them other
[32:10] five talents so he put those talents to
[32:13] work.
[32:14] And likewise, he that received two, he
[32:16] also gained other two. So notice this uh
[32:20] doubling of what was given. But he that
[32:23] received one went and digged in the
[32:24] earth and hid his lord's money. After a
[32:27] long time, the lord of those servants
[32:28] cometh and reckoned it with them.
[32:29] There's this judging. There's this
[32:31] accounting that takes place. And so he
[32:33] that had received the five talents came
[32:35] and brought other five talents, saying,
[32:37] Lord, thou deliverest unto me five
[32:39] talents. Behold, I've gained beside them
[32:41] five talents more.
[32:43] And recognize this. One had five, and we
[32:47] we assess some measure to that. He had
[32:48] five talents. Now he has 10. But the
[32:51] Lord's response is, "Well done, thou
[32:52] good and faithful servant. Thou hast
[32:54] been faithful over a few things. I will
[32:55] make thee ruler over many things. Enter
[32:57] thou into the joy of the Lord. He who is
[33:00] faithful in the least will be faithful
[33:01] in much. If there's an unfaithfulness in
[33:03] the little, there's going to be
[33:04] unfaithfulness in much."
[33:06] &gt;&gt; There's that principle to understand
[33:08] with all of us. We need to demonstrate
[33:09] faithfulness.
[33:11] There has to be some uh a demonstration
[33:13] of responsibility. The coming to be
[33:15] reckoned with is that accountability for
[33:17] what you've been given. And that based
[33:20] upon their faithfulness with what
[33:21] they've been given, there's an expansion
[33:23] over what they have or of what they
[33:26] have. And the one that had two, now he
[33:29] says, he also that received two talents
[33:31] came to Lord came and said, Lord, thou
[33:32] deliverest unto me two talents. Behold,
[33:34] I've gained two other talents beside
[33:36] them. His lord said unto him, it's the
[33:38] exact same thing to both. They had
[33:40] different gifts, different measures, but
[33:41] it's the same reward. Well done, good
[33:43] and faithful servant. Thou hast been
[33:45] faithful over a few things. I'll make
[33:46] thee rule over many things. Enter thou
[33:47] into the joy of the Lord. Then he which
[33:50] had received the one talent came and
[33:52] said, This is the part that uh begs so
[33:56] much real pondering. Lord, I knew thee
[33:59] that thou art a hardened man, reaping
[34:01] where thou hast not sown, and gathering
[34:02] where thou hast not strod. and I was
[34:05] afraid and went and hid thy talent in
[34:08] the earth. Lo, there thou hast that is
[34:11] thine. He basically gave him back what
[34:13] he gave him. And there might be in some
[34:14] sense of saying, well, he's it's he's
[34:16] breaking even. He's getting back what he
[34:18] put into it. But he blames the master.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; He blames him saying that, well, I knew
[34:26] you were a hard man. And and I want you
[34:29] to think about this in terms of how
[34:31] easily it can be for us to blame God.
[34:33] Now, there's a shifting of this blame.
[34:35] Well, I I knew that you were a hard man.
[34:37] But notice the Lord answers in verse 26,
[34:38] "Thou wicked and slothful servant. Thou
[34:41] knewest that I reap where I sowed not."
[34:42] In other words, his own words condemn
[34:44] him because he says, "I buried this
[34:46] because I knew you reap where you sowed
[34:48] not, and gathered where you have not
[34:49] strod." And he says, "Because you knew
[34:51] that, you used as an excuse, a worthless
[34:54] excuse, because that actually should
[34:56] have compelled you to trade on it,
[34:58] &gt;&gt; right? you you knew how I was with what
[35:01] I had and you would actually take the
[35:03] one and bury it when you knew that I was
[35:06] somebody that got things that I didn't
[35:08] straw and I I reap where I didn't sow.
[35:11] He said that that the logic that they
[35:13] used was flawed. He said, "Thou oughtest
[35:15] therefore to have put my money to the
[35:17] exchangers
[35:19] and then at my coming I should have
[35:20] received mine owned with usery. At least
[35:22] I could have got interest on this.
[35:25] Take therefore the talent from him and
[35:27] give it unto him which hath 10 talents.
[35:31] That's quite a statement.
[35:33] I think there's a concept that we can
[35:35] explore that there's a use it or lose
[35:37] it.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; That has to be used for unto everyone
[35:42] that hath shall be given and he shall
[35:44] have abundance but from him that hath
[35:46] not shall be taken away even that which
[35:48] he hath.
[35:50] I can empathize with brother Elizer
[35:52] where he empathize with brother Elizer
[35:54] where he says the vows and the and the
[35:56] way that the scripture can be written
[35:57] sometimes I go back and I read it in
[35:59] other translations and I try to figure
[36:00] out what is what is even being meant
[36:02] here but there's something here he has
[36:07] he has abundance but then he says take
[36:10] away from him that hath not what does he
[36:12] not have the skill or the employment
[36:16] &gt;&gt; he had something he had the talent but
[36:19] he didn't use it for gain and so you
[36:22] take away from him. He says and cast ye
[36:24] the unprofitable servant into outer
[36:25] darkness. There shall be weeping and
[36:26] nashing of teeth.
[36:29] Each one of them had talents or we could
[36:31] say talent albeit on differing levels.
[36:36] But the judgment was according to the
[36:37] employment
[36:39] &gt;&gt; of the talent.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; God didn't come and say, "Well, you had
[36:43] five and so you can enter in and you had
[36:45] two so you could enter in and you only
[36:47] had one. So tough luck." If he would
[36:49] have done just even produce some
[36:51] interest,
[36:53] &gt;&gt; the judgment was not on what they had
[36:56] been given, but it was the employment of
[36:58] what they had been given,
[37:00] &gt;&gt; the use of it.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; And I
[37:05] I'm trying to keep our streak of sermons
[37:07] under an hour together. You know, we've
[37:09] got three in a row now. Let's make it
[37:10] four. Four is a good number, right? The
[37:13] other the few services ago, I said, I'm
[37:15] trying to be under hour. Still couldn't
[37:16] make it under an hour even when I was
[37:18] trying. But I I have a feeling here
[37:19] unless you guys really really pulled
[37:20] hard that we can get under an hour
[37:22] again. Uh my brother did it, brother
[37:24] Eliza did it. And now here I am trying
[37:26] to follow in their steps. Good examples.
[37:29] But the Bible teaches that there's a
[37:31] duty attached to every talent.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; There is a duty that comes with every
[37:35] capacity that we possess.
[37:38] You cannot have and I want to say this
[37:42] in in a natural sense, in a spiritual
[37:44] sense. I want you to consider it on so
[37:46] many different levels to where it just
[37:47] really I don't mind if this gets heavy
[37:50] for you
[37:52] and that it's a little bit sobering to
[37:55] leave regardless of what age you're at
[37:56] to leave and to think that I have been
[37:58] given life. I've been given being I've
[38:02] been given breath. I've been given time.
[38:03] I've been given health. I've been given
[38:05] different things and resources. And some
[38:07] have it to different levels and
[38:08] different degrees. But even if you just
[38:10] have that one talent,
[38:12] the Bible teaches that there's a duty
[38:14] attached to the one talent.
[38:19] That there is a duty that comes with any
[38:22] capacity that we possess.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; We might talk about this calling we have
[38:29] in the scripture. You say well there can
[38:30] be this calling and we as Christians we
[38:32] look at this we even look at this
[38:34] concept of the gift and then this
[38:35] calling to that gift the employment of
[38:37] the talent which God has given us. It's
[38:39] a stewardship of ability.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; So I have this gift. God give it to me.
[38:44] It's a great gift. But in in a certain
[38:46] way that ought to be served.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; It ought to be used to serve. One of the
[38:50] paradigm shifts that my wife and I had
[38:53] early on in our marriage is when we
[38:54] realized that there was a responsibility
[38:55] to minister the word of God. we had to
[38:57] take that in consideration in how we
[38:58] lived our lives
[39:00] &gt;&gt; that it wasn't necessarily oh this great
[39:02] gift this wonderful gift that I had it
[39:04] but it was something that was God's for
[39:06] the people's benefit and use and so
[39:08] there's a service we give to that gift
[39:12] &gt;&gt; and as we've used this uh concept of
[39:14] sewing and reaping and the prelude and
[39:17] we're using some of these parables of
[39:18] the seed the story of the talents
[39:21] differs from the parable of the sewer
[39:23] because in the parable of the sewer God
[39:25] was the worker who swed the seed and it
[39:28] was the influence of that word that's
[39:29] being swed upon the hearer. But now this
[39:33] parable teaches responsibility
[39:36] and and it has this weight that there's
[39:39] a trust that's given to us by God and
[39:42] that has to be used for his service
[39:46] because notice here the Lord gives the
[39:48] talent. Well, it's from him but now it's
[39:50] mine and what do I do with it? In the
[39:53] parable of the sewer, we can say the one
[39:55] instance the ser the word is is the seed
[39:58] that is sown and it's sewn into a field
[39:59] and it springs up wheat, but then the
[40:02] devil sews another seed and it springs
[40:03] up tears. In another instance, it's not
[40:06] that we have control over the type of
[40:08] ground, but the word is the seed and
[40:09] then the ground is either hard or it
[40:11] doesn't have depth or something comes
[40:12] and steals it away. And there's these
[40:14] different ways we see this is the word
[40:15] that's preached and the impact it has on
[40:17] the hearer. But now he takes the word of
[40:19] the kingdom of God. He looks at it from
[40:20] another perspective. saying, "I want to
[40:22] use this a little bit differently
[40:23] because now I'm teaching the doctrine of
[40:25] responsibility
[40:27] &gt;&gt; that when something is given to us, it's
[40:29] got to be used the right way."
[40:33] &gt;&gt; And this is why I use the phrase of our
[40:35] personal responsibility in being and
[40:37] becoming.
[40:39] But then also this parental
[40:41] responsibility, this responsibility that
[40:42] we have as heads of households or as
[40:44] parents in marriages, even those
[40:47] parishioners of a church. This
[40:48] responsibility that we have of being and
[40:51] becoming.
[40:55] It still speaks to the parable of the
[40:56] sewer, but now you are the swer.
[40:59] You're the one that's been given this
[41:01] gift that can be used, traded, act upon,
[41:04] employed to double what you have. Or you
[41:08] can just take it and bury it in
[41:09] unprofitable earth.
[41:13] Galatians chapter 6 7 8 and 9. Be not
[41:15] deceived. God is not mocked. For
[41:16] whatsoever man seweth that shall he also
[41:18] reap. Hosea tells us you sowed to the
[41:21] wind and what'd you reap? Whirlwind.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; For he that sweth to his flesh shall of
[41:25] the flesh reap corruption. That's not
[41:28] the good kind of sewing, but it works
[41:29] according to the law.
[41:32] the tolerance that we give to certain
[41:34] things, the way that we expose ourselves
[41:35] to certain things, the way that we feed
[41:37] or bury talent into the earth, well,
[41:39] you're going to get something back. And
[41:42] here he says, you're going to reap
[41:43] corruption, but he that sow to the
[41:44] spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[41:46] everlasting.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; The proper use of that which you've been
[41:49] given. So he says, let us not be weary
[41:51] and welloing.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; That's the trading with the talent
[41:54] you've been given. That's the proper
[41:56] employment of the gift you've been
[41:57] given.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Let us not be weary and welloing for in
[42:01] due season we shall reap. If we faint
[42:02] not
[42:04] as we take responsibility over our own
[42:06] personal harvest
[42:09] and we realize that I'm going to be
[42:11] sewing things into my spirit
[42:14] and therefore what I see is going to be
[42:16] a direct reflection of what I've been
[42:18] ingesting and been feeding on.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; There's a correlation.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; There's a correlation to the the
[42:24] mannerisms and the mood and the
[42:26] appetites and the way that you live your
[42:28] life to what comes in is what's coming
[42:30] out.
[42:32] And there's something that the heart is
[42:33] indicting and and feeding on and what's
[42:35] being sewed into it. And so there's
[42:37] certain things that are becoming because
[42:39] they're first being
[42:43] &gt;&gt; and there has to be a responsibility
[42:45] taken over ourselves individually.
[42:48] So I'll take accountability. It's easy
[42:50] always to blame and point fingers. Well,
[42:52] I knew you were this and I knew you were
[42:53] that. Well, it's that very fact that you
[42:55] know these things is the reason why you
[42:57] should be taking responsibility.
[43:02] to plant and to cultivate
[43:12] what who are you
[43:14] and what are you becoming
[43:17] if I continue on this path as a person?
[43:20] What will I look like in five years?
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And some people might say, "Oh, well, I
[43:24] would never do that. I'd never do this."
[43:27] Uh,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; you're not being honest with yourself.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Are are you sure? Because there's clear
[43:36] patterns of behavior
[43:39] &gt;&gt; choices
[43:40] that people make personally
[43:43] that are foreshadowing
[43:46] a change
[43:48] &gt;&gt; and not for the good
[43:51] because they're sowing to the flesh and
[43:52] it's a law immutable law. Be God is not
[43:54] mocked. you will reap corruption. And I
[43:57] believe in the grace of God for those
[43:59] who've sowed to the wrong things and
[44:01] they've allowed themselves to change and
[44:02] they've allowed themselves to get mixed
[44:03] up and the done things that are sinful
[44:06] or wrong that God's grace is still
[44:08] enough.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; But there in these moments right now, we
[44:12] have this respons responsibility to take
[44:14] a step back and say, "All right, what am
[44:16] I planting for? What kind of crop am I
[44:17] going to get?"
[44:18] &gt;&gt; The same could be said within our homes.
[44:21] uh uh something that uh my wife a phrase
[44:23] she uses a lot and I've been thinking
[44:24] about this even in in preparing for
[44:28] these sermons tonight and Lord willing
[44:30] on Sunday in terms of what's promoted
[44:33] &gt;&gt; that there's a certain way where you can
[44:35] allow something or you can uh
[44:38] participate in certain things and you
[44:40] can enjoy it and it has its proper place
[44:42] but then there can be this tipping point
[44:43] to where now it's not just enjoyment
[44:46] it's not just maybe interacting or
[44:48] taking advantage of but now there's more
[44:49] of this promotion
[44:51] And now it begins to have the
[44:53] preeminence
[44:54] &gt;&gt; and those it's from it's from that uh
[44:58] that kind of heaviness or emphasis that
[45:00] it begins to have this uh cascading
[45:02] effect on who you are
[45:05] &gt;&gt; and what you're becoming.
[45:09] I close with this and musicians you're
[45:11] welcome to come to your instruments
[45:14] in the sermon earnestly contending for
[45:16] the faith and it's even in that idea of
[45:18] earnestly contending
[45:21] there must be a a perseverance
[45:25] anyone who has an artistic gift artistic
[45:29] a rt artistic gift others though you can
[45:33] still maybe participate in this brother
[45:34] Michael those that would have this gift
[45:38] there. It doesn't always come easy.
[45:42] Comes with the price. It exacts
[45:43] something. There has to be perseverance.
[45:45] Has to be endurance.
[45:47] A and there sometimes just needs to be
[45:49] this uh butdding up against failure
[45:52] after failure after failure,
[45:56] effort after effort after effort.
[46:00] Therefore, we should not be weary and
[46:01] welloing.
[46:03] some confidence in the seed. Some
[46:05] confidence in the promise of God, some
[46:07] confidence in the trust that he's given
[46:09] us that's sacred. Some confidence in the
[46:12] ability of the Holy Spirit to change
[46:13] things.
[46:15] If we could be honest with the with
[46:16] ourselves tonight, I don't know where
[46:18] all of you are in terms of your walk
[46:19] with God, but I could confidently say
[46:21] right now, I'm so glad that I God still
[46:25] changes me.
[46:28] And if I had not had I not experienced
[46:32] such a transformation out of darkness
[46:33] and delight
[46:35] and I recognized and this is my own
[46:37] personal testimony that God's able in
[46:40] all these situations to change things
[46:43] and that no matter what situation I
[46:46] could remember I had an injury one time
[46:48] and I separated my rib cage uh from my
[46:50] backbone and it from my back and it it
[46:53] healed wrong and I was always in
[46:54] constant pain especially uh in the
[46:57] winter time and and anything that I
[46:59] would be doing to use my arms, it just a
[47:01] searing searing horrible pain. It just
[47:03] healed wrong. And that's I just remember
[47:05] that was my life that I was living. I
[47:08] even had the same where when I was I had
[47:10] such terrible heartburn in college to
[47:12] where I didn't even want to drink water.
[47:15] It's absolutely debilitating.
[47:17] And I remember when my life changed and
[47:21] I received and and just in a moment
[47:23] everything changed and just had a
[47:25] transformation and new birth experience.
[47:26] My heartburn was gone.
[47:29] And uh and I believe there's probably
[47:30] some connection to sin.
[47:33] And then but I still lived with this
[47:36] searing terrible pain in my back. But I
[47:39] remember I would always I'd be brushing
[47:40] my teeth or shaving and I'd be in so
[47:42] much pain it'd be hard to breathe. I
[47:43] just like I know God can heal this.
[47:46] I just kept I just always told myself, I
[47:49] know God can heal this.
[47:52] And so I knew that no matter what was
[47:55] that I believed in a God who could
[47:57] change things.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; And so it gives me hope for any
[48:00] situation here, anybody here,
[48:03] &gt;&gt; that I'm not going to give up on
[48:04] anybody.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Not going to give up on anything because
[48:08] I'm not trusting in myself. I was going
[48:10] to try to work on myself and do some
[48:11] surgery or something like that or find a
[48:13] chiropractor to do this and go there. I
[48:15] had it when my was going through. Let me
[48:16] just testify.
[48:18] So much for maybe an hour, but let me
[48:20] just testify. You probably haven't heard
[48:22] me talk about my pain syndrome that I've
[48:23] had. Why? Because it's gone. I believe.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's changes that you need to
[48:28] make. There's times when it feels like
[48:29] it might be coming on or whatever. But
[48:31] you know what? God is such a God of
[48:33] miracles. I went and saw a specialist. I
[48:35] spent months studying trying to find
[48:36] what it was. Finally figured out what I
[48:38] thought it was. I went to a specialist.
[48:40] Uh and I go to and it was upon the
[48:42] recommendation of Brother Scott. This is
[48:43] no reflection on your your
[48:45] recommendation, but I went to this
[48:46] really uh accomplished doctor
[48:50] uh uh an ENT and he looked at me and he
[48:53] said, "You have burning mouth syndrome."
[48:55] And he said, "And there's nothing I or
[48:57] science can do for you." And my wife was
[49:00] in the room. I think maybe Jack was
[49:02] there too or was it Preston? And and he
[49:05] turned around to walk away. I'm like,
[49:08] he's like, "There's nothing I or science
[49:09] can do." We kind of stopped and he said,
[49:11] "I recommend uh cognitive behavioral
[49:13] therapy to deal with pain. There's
[49:15] certain ways you can cope." But in my
[49:17] heart, I just thought, well, that's what
[49:19] I needed to hear that there was nothing
[49:20] man or science could do for me. So, this
[49:24] is just going to have to be God.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; And so, I've watched God work in my
[49:28] life.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; And so, I believe he's a God is is has
[49:33] power to change things.
[49:36] And if that's the God I serve, the God
[49:38] that can change things, then I want I
[49:42] want to be that vessel. I I want to stay
[49:44] as I am. I want to constantly be
[49:46] changing. And it's that power of change.
[49:49] It's that ability of God who is and this
[49:52] being that I have that it's not just
[49:54] going to always stay this way. That it
[49:56] can get goodter and goodter.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; That it can get better. It can get
[50:00] higher. It can be richer. It can be
[50:01] fuller, sweeter.
[50:04] and that this love of God can become
[50:06] continually become greater more well
[50:08] known to me. That's what I believe. I
[50:10] believe in that process and I'm thankful
[50:13] for it because if I didn't have that
[50:16] there it'd be so much uh unrest.
[50:19] [Music]
[50:21] Brother Bram said and he this is the
[50:23] part I was referring to earlier how it's
[50:25] unique. He says, "Now hearing this
[50:27] brother on those birds like that, that
[50:28] is a spiritual gift. And the best I can
[50:30] gather, it's in earnest earnestly
[50:32] continuing for the faith." He's
[50:34] referring to
[50:37] what sounds like maybe somebody was
[50:38] doing bird calls and impersonating a
[50:41] robin. And I remember in one service one
[50:43] time a sister whistled a special and um
[50:47] and it was beautiful. And so here he's
[50:49] saying that was a spiritual gift. He
[50:50] says, "Try to impersonate it once and
[50:52] see how you get along."
[50:54] You know, there's a certain thing like I
[50:56] can I can uh yodel, right? Like I can
[50:59] just make my voice do some weird things.
[51:00] But then you hear somebody who can
[51:01] actually do it. You're like that's what
[51:04] it's supposed to sound like. Like
[51:06] strummer boy over here on the guitar,
[51:08] right? Three chords. There's, you know,
[51:11] you hear somebody can really do it. Like
[51:12] now that's a gift.
[51:15] He says try to impersonate and see how
[51:17] you do. He says God has given that to
[51:19] the brother.
[51:20] I heard this young man singing that
[51:22] song, yielded Lord to thee, and how that
[51:24] brother Cabbell sitting there told me he
[51:26] was just converted out of the nightclub,
[51:28] he and his wife, and how that singing,
[51:30] he says, try to impersonate that. It's a
[51:32] gift.
[51:33] It comes from God. And I listen, I'm
[51:35] closing on this now. The gift was in him
[51:37] when he was born.
[51:40] The gift was in the other man when he
[51:42] was born.
[51:43] But what they use it for is what goes.
[51:47] Every man will have to answer for his
[51:49] talent. God gives men talent and they
[51:52] have to use it.
[51:55] You can use it
[51:57] as a buried treasure.
[52:00] But there's going to be a day of
[52:01] reckoning. Some can preach like a house
[52:03] on fire and other different things, but
[52:05] God requires these talents. He says,
[52:07] "I'm so thankful to know that these two
[52:08] brethren sitting back there have yielded
[52:10] their talents which they could be out
[52:11] there in nightclubs and everything else
[52:13] and using those talents, but they've
[52:14] surrendered them to the Lord Jesus
[52:16] Christ to win souls." That's my
[52:18] challenge is surrendering your being to
[52:22] him.
[52:24] This gift of eternal life is still yet
[52:26] to be surrendered to him. these natural
[52:27] abilities you might have. If you have
[52:29] the ability to write, if you have the
[52:31] ability to sing, if you have the ability
[52:32] to play, if you have the ability uh uh
[52:34] to draw, yield your gifts to God.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Stir up those gifts. Inspire those gifts
[52:39] correctly because improperly used. Yeah.
[52:41] An idol mind is the devil's playground.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Idle hands are the devil's tools. You
[52:46] say, "Well, be careful what you employ
[52:48] them in."
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Because you could become very skillful
[52:52] in the wrong things.
[52:54] But we who've been committed this great
[52:56] trust of the word of God, we ought to
[52:57] practice it and and not be unskilled in
[53:00] the word of knowledge.
[53:02] Let us think about what it means to be
[53:05] and what we're becoming. If we could
[53:07] stand together this evening, commit
[53:10] these words to God.
[53:12] Every man will have to answer for his
[53:14] talent. It's how you use it.
[53:18] How are we using that which we've
[53:20] received?
[53:21] What are we using our resources for?
[53:26] And how is it that God is receiving the
[53:28] glory in these things? Let us pray
[53:31] together with heads bowed. If you desire
[53:33] prayer this evening, just feel free to
[53:34] lift your hand to the Lord. Believe he
[53:36] sees your heart. And I believe there's
[53:38] nothing to nothing impossible with God.
[53:42] I I I can believe with you now. There's
[53:44] I I'm not without hope. You should not
[53:46] be without hope. Our gracious heavenly
[53:48] father, tonight as we stand in your
[53:50] divine presence, we give you thanks for
[53:52] this wonderful congregation, this
[53:54] beautiful atmosphere that we've
[53:55] experienced,
[53:56] Lord, the labor of the song leader and
[53:58] the musicians, all those that come on a
[54:00] Wednesday night.
[54:02] And Lord, as we go through changes,
[54:04] whether it be as a church or family, and
[54:06] things shift a little bit, we can get
[54:08] uncomfortable with change.
[54:11] But Lord, you
[54:14] have never changed for the worse. You
[54:18] just you never have.
[54:21] When you revealed yourself, even if it
[54:24] was in thunderings and lightning, even
[54:25] if it was a God of of correction, that
[54:28] was always for good.
[54:32] And Lord, I
[54:35] I know I can do better at trusting you.
[54:39] And I thank you, Lord, that you've saw
[54:41] us through the highs and lows.
[54:45] That even in our darkest moments, we can
[54:47] still have hope.
[54:49] Not a hope that's an enemy to faith, but
[54:52] a hope that's born from faith.
[54:54] [Music]
[54:56] Lord, I believe that's what Solomon was
[54:59] doing in Ecclesiastes. He was shutting
[55:01] the door to everything else but faith.
[55:04] [Music]
[55:06] And Lord, sometimes we too closely cling
[55:08] to those things which can be seen
[55:11] and so we look to the unseen.
[55:14] So what a lesson,
[55:17] what a what a reckoning, what an audit
[55:20] of our lives to say better is that which
[55:22] is seen than the wondering of the
[55:23] desire. And it should challenge us,
[55:26] Lord. And Lord, as I've stopped here
[55:29] tonight and even just adjusted the notes
[55:32] so that I wouldn't go any further, Lord,
[55:33] may we give consideration to what is hid
[55:35] in us?
[55:39] What What is it that's at the heart of
[55:40] these things and this searching and this
[55:42] longing? I pray for every hand that was
[55:45] raised tonight. I believe in the
[55:46] supernatural power of God to answer
[55:48] prayer. I believe if there's someone
[55:50] who's seeking truth, they could find it.
[55:52] I believe if there's a hurting heart, it
[55:53] can be healed. And Lord, I pray that the
[55:56] power of God would move
[55:59] and it would break chains,
[56:02] deliver from unbelief, that foul spirits
[56:05] could be cast out.
[56:08] That despondency and fear and depression
[56:10] and anxiety could be vanquished and
[56:12] overcome. Whatever it may be, Lord, that
[56:15] seems to grind us down and wear us down.
[56:17] May we rise up and look up and believe
[56:19] in a greater God than all those things.
[56:23] And Lord, look at what you have done for
[56:25] us. If there's some here who look around
[56:27] and don't have not seen you, have not
[56:28] tasted you and have not known you. That
[56:30] Lord, I pray right now you make yourself
[56:32] known. They could see you and they could
[56:35] taste you. May they recognize the death
[56:37] of the wondering of the desire
[56:41] and come to you to seek your face. We
[56:43] love you. We commit everyone to you
[56:44] tonight and ask your he for your healing
[56:46] and your deliverance in the name of Lord
[56:48] Jesus Christ. Amen.
