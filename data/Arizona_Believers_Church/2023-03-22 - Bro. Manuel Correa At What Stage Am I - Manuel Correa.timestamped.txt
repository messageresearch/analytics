[0:02] as I was reading this book
[0:05] I was going through these verses
[0:11] these specific words
[0:13] about these men
[0:19] it's speaking about when God's people
[0:26] several of them were allowed
[0:30] Babylonia to leave the bondage of
[0:32] Babylon Israel to go back to Israel
[0:35] to build God's Temple
[0:42] and it says that the man by the name of
[0:45] Ezra
[0:48] 's
[0:50] bus
[0:54] in his heart this man Ezra to search for
[0:56] the Levites
[1:00] so they can go back and minister in
[1:02] God's Temple but
[1:05] it wasn't enough
[1:10] with them them just saying or saying hey
[1:13] I'm part of the levite
[1:15] they actually have to prove it
[1:18] so it says here in the Bible that they
[1:20] sought the record of their genealogy
[1:25] and since they couldn't find it
[1:29] foreign
[1:48] it's not enough
[2:08] in the records
[2:11] that will be put out of it
[2:21] for some reason God allowed for every
[2:23] story in the Bible to be recorded
[2:41] out of everything that we're reading as
[2:44] we go along
[2:45] that's how I am
[2:49] I'm taking every little piece
[2:53] so I can start watching my own life
[2:57] and so this made me start thinking a lot
[3:04] Lord am I part of this group is my name
[3:06] recorded down
[3:10] because it just won't be enough by me
[3:13] giving my own word
[3:15] your word is not enough
[3:19] many as it says many will say Lord
[3:23] but that's not enough
[3:27] we
[3:32] belong to this church we belong to the
[3:34] other one
[3:36] hombre you and I our name
[3:41] has to First be recorded down
[3:44] since before the foundation of the world
[3:49] but this takes me
[3:55] to remember when I was a little boy
[3:59] foreign
[4:02] I remember when I accepted the Lord
[4:05] Jesus Christ
[4:06] is a
[4:08] Miss Padres
[4:10] my parents accepted the message
[4:15] when I was around 9 10 years of age
[4:20] but I got baptized
[4:24] when I was around 15 16 years of age
[4:31] and we know that many times
[4:34] you don't understand
[4:37] or rather we we have to understand
[4:40] to be able to know
[4:43] that we belongs to God's people
[4:47] that we're not going to be rejected
[4:52] sometimes we have to first understand
[4:54] where are we standing
[4:56] and what path are we in our Christian
[4:59] Life
[5:05] the three stages of Grace
[5:08] [Music]
[5:09] because sometimes we do forget
[5:17] many of us have already been born again
[5:20] and many times those three stages of
[5:23] Grace
[5:26] we forget that there's other people that
[5:28] are barely going through those three
[5:30] stages
[5:32] and I remember
[5:35] that when I got baptized
[5:39] I just felt something in my heart
[5:43] that's
[6:11] so what likely what happens that every
[6:14] two times two or three times a year we
[6:16] had a minister that would come visit us
[6:50] uh perfectly listened and paid attention
[6:53] to all the three stages of Grace
[6:57] so because of that I didn't know what to
[6:59] do with that which was inside me
[7:04] now that I look back with a more time of
[7:08] experience
[7:10] I would have liked if someone would have
[7:13] would have come to me yo
[7:18] and for them to explain and then for me
[7:20] to tell him what I was feeling as well
[7:22] and for that this person would tell me
[7:26] you're just in justification
[7:28] you not have to go on to sanctification
[7:32] and then from then you go to the new
[7:34] birth
[7:35] but sometimes Brothers
[7:40] we make a mistake as mature Christians
[7:42] that we are that we forget
[7:48] that sometimes our own children are
[7:50] going through those same stages
[7:52] and they need guides
[8:01] to understand
[8:06] what they're going through
[8:10] now if we go to the Bible
[8:18] there's no uh specific spot where it
[8:21] says you have to have this amount of
[8:22] time in this certain stage
[8:24] that's something that I didn't know
[8:31] but the Devil he's the devil in the
[8:34] village and in the city
[8:39] and when you're unaware
[8:44] and many times you as a mature Christian
[8:47] that you are okay
[8:50] you see those things like oh that's so
[8:53] obvious
[8:55] for the person that's passing
[8:58] but
[9:01] it's not so obvious for the other person
[9:03] that's just barely walking by
[9:20] if you were born in the message
[9:23] or out of the message
[9:26] that you and I this is
[9:31] the Bible says in Genesis 1 to 4 it says
[9:35] and says and the Earth was out of order
[9:41] and it says that the darkness was on the
[9:44] face of the deep
[9:46] I can compare that to my own self
[9:49] and that's what I had to understand
[9:51] foreign
[10:05] and we're in darkness
[10:11] we start with justification that's where
[10:14] it begins what's next then
[10:19] and then if we continue the awesome
[10:22] piece
[10:25] now God what is it that he starts doing
[10:27] the first thing he made the light
[10:32] what do every one of us needs
[10:35] the Revelation the light
[10:38] of those little things okay
[10:45] but my issue
[10:48] is
[10:48] that sometimes I forget
[10:52] that those are Mysteries
[10:56] people are going through that is
[11:00] and that's something that I was thinking
[11:02] a while ago
[11:03] I was asking God for forgiveness
[11:06] actually I said Lord forgive me
[11:09] I think I've been a bit uh inconsiderate
[11:14] knowing what I went through
[11:17] I had no one to Lead Me
[11:22] I sometimes I I regard this as something
[11:25] that everybody knows that already
[11:28] and then the Devil comes and begins to
[11:31] toy with that person
[11:33] just like he tore it with me
[11:35] as long as you and I
[11:38] Repent or the person that just barely
[11:40] repented as long as they don't accept
[11:44] that he's without order
[11:46] I mean it
[11:48] is
[11:52] I remember that a few years ago I was at
[11:55] home and I invited some brothers to come
[11:57] over
[11:58] and these brothers and I we were having
[12:00] a little talks
[12:04] and I don't know what happened at church
[12:06] because I invited them to come over
[12:08] after church
[12:10] but it was something in regards to the
[12:13] family of the pastor
[12:16] and these brothers were not long in the
[12:19] message
[12:20] and so one of them replies and says
[12:26] he says yeah the pastor says that
[12:28] because it's easier for his own children
[12:32] they didn't have to go to the things of
[12:35] the world that we had to go through
[12:38] it's easier for them
[12:42] because they don't go through the
[12:44] Temptations that we had to go through
[12:49] pastor and in some aspect I did feel
[12:52] that I was on the side of the pastor's
[12:54] kids
[12:58] I'm not a pastor's son but I was raised
[13:00] as a Christian from a very young age and
[13:03] I said hold up
[13:06] Jose I said why is it easier for the
[13:09] children of the pasture
[13:12] was because they weren't in the world
[13:18] they don't have the bad experiences like
[13:20] we had
[13:22] um
[13:26] let me tell you from my own perspective
[13:28] and experience
[13:31] it's just as hard as for you that was in
[13:34] the world
[13:35] or easy however you want to put it
[13:39] it's still the same decision that
[13:41] everyone has to take
[13:46] even seen from the Outlook that you have
[13:49] is
[13:54] sometimes it's even harder for the one
[13:56] that was raised as a Christian he said
[13:59] why
[14:01] he says because look uh you can think
[14:05] I don't know if this is something that
[14:07] has happened to everyone but
[14:09] sometimes the Devil comes
[14:13] and you come to think well I have
[14:15] actually nothing to repent of
[14:17] I never went to dances
[14:20] I haven't smoked I haven't stolen
[14:24] anything
[14:25] I haven't done this this or this
[14:28] then what is it that I have to repent of
[14:53] that your life is without order as long
[14:56] as the holy spirit is not in it
[14:58] we're going from stage to Stage
[15:04] some some people can last in
[15:06] justification
[15:08] for some time
[15:12] other people can last in sanctification
[15:14] for some time
[15:19] there's other people like in the book of
[15:21] Acts they receive the Holy Ghost without
[15:22] even being baptized first
[15:24] it all depends
[15:29] of the Cry of the person that they have
[15:31] in their heart
[15:32] that's the difference
[15:49] sometimes we forget
[15:53] to approach them that were just newly
[15:56] baptized
[15:59] and what is it that you feel
[16:02] do you know do you know what you got
[16:07] what stage are you in
[16:11] yeah
[16:17] of transformation
[16:22] now the dictionary says Transformer to
[16:25] transform when espanol in Spanish it
[16:29] says it like this they say it says
[16:36] to shape the form or shape of someone or
[16:39] something
[16:43] important
[16:45] it doesn't matter if you grew up in
[16:47] church or in el mundo or in the world
[16:50] both
[16:53] have to be transformed
[16:58] many times many of us have arrays in the
[17:01] message
[17:02] we have to be changed
[17:05] to have love towards the people
[17:09] and then there to understand
[17:12] that this is not a social club
[17:17] that we are a part
[17:21] they're like
[17:22] of God's people
[17:30] because that transformation has to
[17:33] happen in every one of us
[17:35] maybe those that are coming from the
[17:37] world
[17:38] to leave everything behind that is of
[17:41] the world
[17:42] we that are in church
[17:46] to stop seeing the things in the church
[17:48] the way we see them now
[17:52] start being true Christians una
[17:55] transformation it's a transformation
[17:59] meet it
[18:04] and the devil we ourselves we have to be
[18:07] careful
[18:09] many times we worry
[18:13] and that's fine
[18:15] in regards to knowing god
[18:19] how many times
[18:22] do we dedicate ourselves to get to know
[18:24] the devil
[18:28] it's importante that's something that is
[18:31] important
[18:33] because that's the one you're going to
[18:35] be facing
[18:39] you have to get to know your adversary
[18:46] everyone that is going to be in that
[18:49] face off
[18:52] for those that like sports or for those
[18:54] of us that like sports
[18:56] we know that the trainers are the
[18:58] coaches
[19:00] they study their opponent
[19:05] they study their
[19:09] weaknesses
[19:13] where and how they can they can attack
[19:15] them
[19:18] they don't just come to the game and say
[19:21] I'm just here to play let's see how this
[19:23] works out
[19:25] sometimes as Christians that's exactly
[19:27] what we do
[19:30] okay
[19:32] sometimes we want to face off the devil
[19:34] without getting to know him first
[19:37] without knowing what is his behavior
[19:40] like
[19:42] yeah this is
[19:45] in the sardisian church age
[19:52] he says now the church died during the
[19:55] the Dark Ages
[19:59] and became completely Pagan here
[20:03] then the restoration
[20:06] that's a Reformation
[20:10] Reformation
[20:12] but to be reformed in acido De Nuevo and
[20:16] being born again
[20:18] are two different things
[20:23] to be reformed
[20:26] inaccido de Nuevo and to be born again
[20:29] are different things
[20:33] and
[20:36] that's sometimes the exactly this the
[20:39] spot where we make the mistake of not
[20:41] knowing
[20:44] in what stage of Grace are we are as
[20:46] Christians
[20:49] because that's where the devil got us
[20:51] many of us
[20:53] we reach sanctification
[20:57] we left all the filthy habits behind
[20:59] yeah
[21:01] we behave as true Christians now
[21:10] I'm now reformed
[21:14] and sometimes we stop there
[21:18] and we stayed there a long time
[21:21] I say that by personal experience
[21:26] yo
[21:27] okay
[21:31] I remember that I went through the stage
[21:34] of sanctification
[21:36] I I wanted nothing to do with the world
[21:45] he's not going to come to present you
[21:47] the same vices that you once had
[21:52] you see
[21:57] what he's going to do he's going to
[21:59] start working on us but in a different
[22:00] angle
[22:02] what way did he work with me
[22:06] I started judging everyone else
[22:11] foreign
[22:19] but all
[22:23] um
[22:24] but I did that just to judge everyone
[22:26] else
[22:28] I said this guy's smoking how could he
[22:31] be in sanctification
[22:35] you know what I don't think he's even
[22:36] reached justifications
[22:39] he's a hot head
[22:43] Ed the message says this this and this
[22:51] and a doctor of the message
[22:54] but to judge the rest of the people
[22:59] and you think you're actually worthy of
[23:01] everything
[23:02] because I've been changed I'm not who I
[23:07] once was
[23:10] and I've actually asked myself a
[23:12] question the the
[23:16] colors I remember that colored woman
[23:19] that brother random says
[23:23] and I remember one time and this is the
[23:26] way that God woke me up and then they
[23:28] didn't get it to understand what stage I
[23:31] was going through
[23:33] he says that this woman said
[23:38] I'm maybe not what I ought to be
[23:43] but I think God I'm not what I used to
[23:45] be
[23:47] but your military and me meditating on
[23:50] this
[23:51] is I asked myself this question is
[23:57] a time comes when this question is it
[24:00] comes to you in your Christian Life
[24:03] thankfully
[24:04] we are not what we once were
[24:09] Lord
[24:21] why is it that I'm not what I should be
[24:26] I'm not what I once was
[24:32] neither am I what I should be at this
[24:34] point in my life in the message in my
[24:36] Christian Life
[24:44] I've simply not being what we used to be
[24:54] I encountered this in my own life
[24:57] I'm married now yes
[25:01] I'm like 27 20 years of age
[25:05] and I'm not what I should be
[25:08] I I did understand that I'm not what I
[25:12] used to be
[25:14] but neither was I at the point in my
[25:17] life where I should be
[25:22] because the devil was playing with me
[25:30] because he played with me
[25:32] pensando thinking
[25:35] that to be reformed
[25:38] because of that I've had already
[25:40] received the Holy Ghost
[25:42] he made me become a religious person
[25:48] but it wasn't with the intention of
[25:50] helping the rest of the people
[25:52] it wasn't with the intention of helping
[25:54] the church
[25:57] but just to keep myself occupied
[26:05] [Music]
[26:07] I previously heard this and I didn't
[26:10] understand it
[26:13] he's not concerned
[26:16] when a person accepts the Lord Jesus
[26:19] Christ and that's something I couldn't
[26:21] wrap my hand around El Diablo the devil
[26:25] is not worried about when a person gets
[26:29] baptized
[26:34] does not get worried
[26:38] if you and I reach sanctification
[26:45] and many times you know what is what's
[26:48] the sad part
[26:50] is
[26:52] that sometimes he's not even concerned
[26:54] if you and I are born again
[26:56] because even brother Branham says
[27:00] there's people that have the Holy Ghost
[27:02] and they don't know what it's for
[27:08] they don't even know what that is able
[27:10] to produce
[27:16] then why should he be concerned
[27:23] it's like for example if someone gives
[27:25] me a tool that I don't know how to use
[27:27] it doesn't matter how efficient that
[27:31] tool is
[27:32] if you and I don't know how to handle it
[27:35] then it won't work
[27:58] this is now brother Branham says in
[28:03] in the message adoption
[28:06] this is why I'm saying
[28:11] that the devil sometimes he's not even
[28:13] worried didn't get that bad what stage
[28:15] estamos we are in
[28:18] they say he says
[28:22] he says but the teaching positionally
[28:25] places the mammal
[28:28] in locales and what he is inosotros and
[28:31] he says and we Nosotros
[28:35] are never never able correctament to
[28:39] correctly have faith
[28:41] until we know
[28:45] positionally who we are
[28:50] when I read this I was able to
[28:52] understand what I couldn't understand
[28:53] before
[28:59] sometimes it's not something that's
[29:00] concerning for the devil
[29:02] that a person gets baptized persona
[29:07] yeah
[29:08] that a person is able to reach uh
[29:10] justifications
[29:12] what worries him is
[29:22] and then we find Our Place brother
[29:26] guess up sepamos that we recognize
[29:30] Where We Belong
[29:35] because when you and I and then demos
[29:38] are able to understand who we are
[29:44] that's when that Machinery that tool
[29:46] begins to function yes
[29:49] and that's when the devil knows that
[29:52] we're going to be a hassle for him
[29:57] because he's no longer able to scare us
[29:59] now
[30:01] we're going to be helpful for the
[30:03] pasture
[30:06] no
[30:10] no
[30:11] one time I heard this and I said well
[30:13] you know that's true
[30:18] and the Sheep
[30:22] who do you think is the one that
[30:24] produces the Sheep
[30:29] the pastor or the Sheep
[30:35] is
[30:39] but many times we want the pasture to be
[30:41] both Shepherd and sheep at the same time
[30:46] the pastor can't produce something that
[30:48] he's not
[30:49] he's there to take care of the of the
[30:53] flock
[30:56] that very flock is producing more sheep
[31:02] amen amen
[31:05] but for those sheeps
[31:09] to be able to produce those sheep
[31:14] we have to know first the things of the
[31:16] message
[31:18] how to even take care of our own selves
[31:23] because the pasture the time will come
[31:28] he won't be always there with the flock
[31:43] but those sheep they learn themselves
[31:45] how to take care of themselves
[31:49] and to produce more sheep what is it
[31:52] that we need them
[31:54] to understand our place
[31:59] where every one of us is positioned
[32:04] he
[32:06] and many times understanding
[32:09] is
[32:11] I was talking I want this element of
[32:14] running and even brother random says
[32:18] nothing that is happening right now is
[32:21] something new
[32:24] all the anointings that are now we can
[32:27] find them actually in the Bible
[32:34] and as time goes on there's more
[32:36] anointings and more spirits and more
[32:38] that is moving among the Believers
[32:41] and praise God
[32:46] I remember I think it was around 10
[32:48] years ago
[32:52] there was a great split between the
[32:54] message Believers
[32:56] that's what at least happening in Latin
[32:59] America
[33:00] with the ones that believed
[33:02] and
[33:06] with those that didn't believe uh
[33:09] brother Banner's return Ministry
[33:11] there was a huge split because of that
[33:16] when supposedly Doctrine doesn't
[33:18] separate
[33:21] that's already in the Bible
[33:24] didn't Paul
[33:28] when he was uh imprinted
[33:34] when he was before those that some
[33:36] believed and some didn't believe in the
[33:38] resurrection of the Dead
[33:40] and he had them to fight over that
[33:46] he said it's the same anointing
[33:50] started
[33:52] that we should be watching out for
[33:55] parakeet for what reason to fight
[34:00] to pick a side no it's not for that
[34:05] Paul said that's not our custom
[34:09] to be bickering
[34:14] we should be concerned actually
[34:30] what God's word says
[34:34] now there apparently there's another
[34:36] split that's coming around
[34:38] those that believe okay
[34:41] they should only play tapes
[34:46] and then the other ones I believe that
[34:48] this should be live preachers
[34:55] the devil's clever and
[34:58] Diablo but the devil that don't the the
[35:01] people rather that don't know the devil
[35:04] or they don't read the Bible
[35:07] they don't read the message
[35:10] he's able to come and just toy with
[35:13] those people
[35:18] I don't think any of us want the devil
[35:20] to come to us and start toying with us
[35:23] but we thank God for all of that
[35:26] is
[35:28] because that's what makes us become or
[35:32] actually
[35:34] to make the True Believer stand out
[35:39] where are we standing
[35:41] what is it that you're believing
[35:48] immediate
[35:50] yes
[35:51] and that makes me Ponder
[35:56] sabemos and we know
[35:59] there are lives as Christians
[36:05] against flesh and blood
[36:08] our struggle is the spiritual world
[36:11] and that then takes me to another
[36:13] question
[36:17] the Bible says in the book of Ezra Uno
[36:20] Cinco 1 5.
[36:24] in
[36:46] Israel 1 5 says then rose up the chief
[36:49] of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and
[36:51] the priests and the Levites with all
[36:53] them who spared God raised to go up to
[36:56] build the house of the Lord which is in
[36:58] Jerusalem
[37:01] this is also actually it caught really
[37:03] my attention they say it says
[37:09] it says that it was a spirit
[37:14] race
[37:16] all of them
[37:20] build the house of the Lord
[37:23] it was the spirit
[37:25] moves them it moved them before
[37:30] so what is the spirit that is moving me
[37:32] today
[37:39] what is the spirit that's anointing me
[37:44] that's something I just uh you
[37:46] personally know and I personally
[37:48] because we know our own lives
[37:52] because by our fruits by our works at
[37:57] the audio on a daily basis
[38:01] we know what spirit is anointing us
[38:06] what is the spirit that's inside us
[38:08] Brothers
[38:10] there's a spirit that comes here
[38:17] but Inspirations
[38:19] despair comes to inspire this person
[38:23] and when I was reading this
[38:26] right away I started thinking about my
[38:29] own life in the in the past few months
[38:36] and I started to examine everything that
[38:38] I've done
[38:48] how
[38:51] I act
[38:54] at my job
[38:59] did you know that Paul himself he
[39:02] exhorts us
[39:03] to be good laborers
[39:07] and I'll be whining while we're at work
[39:15] all of that
[39:19] sometimes we need to turn
[39:22] around and see the footprints that we're
[39:24] leaving behind
[39:29] that we're starting to understand
[39:34] how upright or crooked we're walking
[39:38] that's the only way
[39:41] as you look at the footsteps that we're
[39:45] leaving behind
[39:47] all right
[39:48] or maybe those of us that are married
[39:54] if we ask our spouses
[39:58] what is the spirit that leads us
[40:11] or ask our children
[40:19] or if we would ask the parents about the
[40:21] children
[40:27] in regards to that subject a long time
[40:30] ago I found that I was really lacking
[40:32] that I would easily get really desperate
[40:35] and upset
[40:38] it's not wrong if you get angry
[40:43] what's wrong is when the rage overtakes
[40:46] you
[40:48] when you don't know how to handle that
[40:51] so what what to do then
[40:57] because we know that uh anger is the
[41:01] beginning
[41:02] of insanity
[41:09] and how many times how many uh insane
[41:12] bizarre things have we not done in Ohio
[41:14] while we're angry
[41:18] I remember that my mother used to tell
[41:21] me
[41:21] she said when you have your kids
[41:24] if you're going to rebuke them
[41:27] you hit them
[41:30] before you get angry
[41:33] because if you do it while you're angry
[41:37] there's a high percentage
[41:40] that you'll you'll hurt them too much
[41:44] and I didn't understand that and so it
[41:48] finally happened to me
[41:50] and I had to understand
[41:52] and ask God
[41:56] that that spirit and that specific
[41:59] circumstance was dominated
[42:02] I was asking for wisdom as a father for
[42:04] him to give me
[42:08] because that actually is a bad testimony
[42:13] how can I tell my son that God is love
[42:17] if every time that he gets me angry I
[42:20] give him a good one
[42:25] what is the spirit that is anointing me
[42:31] there was one thing that I really liked
[42:34] and I'll speak a little bit bad about my
[42:37] own country
[42:41] in Mexico I like that in Mexico
[42:45] the streets aren't like how they are
[42:48] here
[42:49] nicely even
[42:52] there's a lot of potholes over there
[42:55] and as you're driving
[43:18] it's good that you're looking out for
[43:20] the Mysteries
[43:24] but let's not forget the Minor Details
[43:26] that are down here below
[43:30] because now we're going to hit a pothole
[43:34] right
[43:35] now brother random says
[43:39] he says a lot of people have been
[43:41] deceived
[43:44] to believe that they have received the
[43:46] Holy Ghost
[43:49] as I said before today they have so many
[43:51] doctrines
[43:55] for example Elijah's Mantle
[43:59] and so many other things
[44:02] Los Hijos the children many manifestos
[44:07] de dios Gods manifested children
[44:11] in all these different isms that are in
[44:14] the world
[44:16] and the people just blindly go on
[44:20] and they just simply received some mere
[44:23] kind of Sensations
[44:26] and then they rise up with an arrogant
[44:28] spirit indifferente in different
[44:30] exegente fasi ipel
[45:00] I remember one time that I was in church
[45:03] and the church was packed out
[45:08] and I remember that the Deacon asked me
[45:11] can you scoot over just a little bit
[45:14] and I scooted over and then he sat some
[45:16] people there
[45:18] and then he asked me again can you scoot
[45:20] over a little bit more
[45:28] but I was getting a bit ticked off
[45:32] and then he came for a third time
[45:35] he says can you scoot over
[45:39] by then I've been I had an urge to just
[45:42] get up
[45:44] and give them about two three quotes of
[45:47] brother random
[45:50] as well
[45:54] and I thought that then I had the Holy
[45:56] Ghost
[46:02] sometimes the devil he tricks us
[46:05] that's why as Christians
[46:08] that's why brother exhorts us so much
[46:11] every day
[46:14] so watch what we're doing
[46:19] every day as Paul says
[46:23] to be dying
[46:27] right as the Lord also it's something
[46:29] that's painful
[46:31] but we have to get there
[46:36] and I always carry that question with me
[46:44] possibly I'm not what I used to be
[46:48] okay
[46:50] but I have to reach the point where I
[46:52] have to be no matter I can't settle
[46:58] with uh just leaving behind what I used
[47:01] to be
[47:04] I mean
[47:07] I would like to close with just a few
[47:10] stories
[47:11] we have a zealous God
[47:16] and even brother Adam says
[47:21] he says
[47:23] he says Satan is such a clever enemy
[47:31] is
[47:33] he says he's so clever
[47:39] this is he says he's so clever
[47:43] that's the word
[47:49] he'll come in just as quickly and so
[47:53] easily
[47:54] seven did you know
[47:57] it looks so innocent at first
[48:01] and that's the problem
[48:06] that we think the uh the devil's so
[48:09] obvious with what he's going to do
[48:12] but we know Diablo that the devil is
[48:17] just as religious as you and I
[48:21] see it's true
[48:24] and so bold as well
[48:28] he was so bold that he went to go tempt
[48:31] Jesus
[48:33] what can we expect for us then
[48:39] you don't think he'll dare to come to us
[48:43] he dared to go temp Jesus
[48:47] he dared to attempt every one of the
[48:49] prophets
[48:53] he goes face to face with God
[49:00] so don't think that we're better than
[49:02] the devil please
[49:05] says when you and I
[49:09] we belittle the devil is
[49:12] that's when we're we're the most in
[49:14] danger
[49:18] ous
[49:20] that's when we're the most in danger
[49:25] and I really like this story
[49:28] the brother random tells us
[49:30] about this little boy yes
[49:34] and that's the kind of life that you
[49:36] should that you should carry
[49:41] of the little boy that was uh Crossing
[49:43] through with a bicycle
[49:48] he
[49:49] they say in Vancouver Colombia he says
[49:53] in Vancouver British Columbia
[49:56] um
[49:58] they were giving out a prize to the
[50:01] little boy that could uh drive with a
[50:03] little bicycle
[50:09] 12 inches wide
[50:12] by 100 yards
[50:14] it was just about this wide
[50:18] it was like merely almost like 100 yards
[50:22] is like a football stadium right
[50:26] he can only be about within this range
[50:29] as he was going with the bicycle
[50:32] I'm sure you've already heard this story
[50:39] sweet he says they were giving away a
[50:42] swim bicycle
[50:45] buenos and the rest of the boys thought
[50:48] they were good at steering
[50:51] and that's what the devil does with us
[50:54] sometimes I think many of us we feel
[50:56] that we're good Christians
[50:59] evil Central
[51:02] he was going he was going uh to the
[51:05] downtown of the city to go get some uh
[51:08] errands or groceries for his mother
[51:12] he had a basket with the with the
[51:14] groceries in one hand
[51:16] and he would have put it under his arm
[51:23] and he would even uh grab the steering
[51:26] wheel or the
[51:30] handlebarso so everyone knew that he was
[51:33] the one that was going to win that uh
[51:34] competition
[51:36] and before that competition
[51:38] just like the rest of the other children
[51:43] everyone thought that they would win
[51:45] that contest
[51:46] cristianos just like the same with the
[51:49] Christians
[51:51] we all think that we're going to be part
[51:53] of the rapture
[51:57] but then the trial comes
[52:01] and then that's when you really see
[52:04] who's gonna make it
[52:06] because we go back
[52:09] the scripture that we read at the
[52:11] beginning
[52:14] if your name is not in the register
[52:20] it doesn't matter how much we think and
[52:22] we said we're going to win that contest
[52:35] foreign
[53:08] he was able to reach actually all the
[53:11] way to the end
[53:12] he never started stumbling
[53:16] so then all the boys got around him and
[53:20] said
[53:24] and he said
[53:27] he says boys
[53:29] this is what happened
[53:33] I watch what every one of you were doing
[53:38] and I saw all of your mistakes
[53:42] see all of you were looking down
[53:44] like this
[53:47] trying to keep yourself on the plank
[53:50] I just looked at the at the finish line
[53:53] and I was able to remain centered
[53:57] in a 12-inch plank
[54:00] what is it that God told Joshua
[54:03] not to the left North to the right
[54:08] straight through the middle
[54:10] that's what this little boy did
[54:14] many many uh were veering to the left
[54:17] others were veering to the right but he
[54:21] kept himself in the center
[54:24] what is it that God has commanded us
[54:27] the same that God told Joshua
[54:31] don't turn
[54:34] to the right North to the left
[54:39] but right through the middle
[54:43] and that's how this boy was able to
[54:45] reach it to the Finish Line
[54:47] keeping himself centered
[54:51] that's the only way we're going to make
[54:53] it
[54:54] good
[54:55] Ness
[54:56] being centered
[54:59] not to one side
[55:02] neither to the other side and now the
[55:05] other story is
[55:07] of the Prophet Andreas Primera de Reyes
[55:11] and First Kings
[55:17] it says that the Lord commanded him to
[55:20] go bring a message
[55:22] and
[55:26] don't come back from where you came from
[55:32] but then it says that a prophet came a
[55:35] major prophet and said
[55:38] God spoke to me
[55:41] for you to come
[55:44] but God had already given the message to
[55:47] this prophet he said don't stop
[55:53] don't come back from the same way you
[55:55] came from
[55:57] and to this young prophet
[56:02] it cost them his life
[56:06] to disobey what God told him
[56:10] neither to one side no to the other side
[56:15] because we'll fall off
[56:21] it's the same thing that will happen to
[56:23] this Prophet here
[56:27] we know
[56:29] the message was given to us
[56:33] we know what you and I have to do
[56:36] to disobey this message
[56:42] not literally
[56:44] but spiritually
[56:47] but for that necesitamos we need
[56:51] is
[56:54] to be positioned in the body of Christ
[56:57] is a is
[57:01] to cross that bridge or I really don't
[57:04] know how to word it is
[57:07] a narrow one
[57:11] like the story of the the little kid
[57:13] with the bicycle contest
[57:18] we've been giving a message
[57:21] it doesn't matter how much we hear it
[57:25] but
[57:28] if it's not according to God's message
[57:30] in God's word
[57:32] it might cost us our life
[57:38] we have to know
[57:41] who is our enemy how does he act
[57:47] and where we're standing
[57:52] alas if you can please stand Thomas
